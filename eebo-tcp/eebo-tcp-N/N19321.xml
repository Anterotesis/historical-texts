            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>IT has generally been received that republics cannot ſubſiſt but upon the baſis of virtue. If by this it is meant that ſuch governments cannot ſubſiſt without a certain portion of virtue it is true with reſpect to thoſe and all others too, and all ſocieties of men: when virtue ſhall expire on earth then muſt ſucceed that ſcene of horrors preſented by the dramatic poet;
<q>
                  <l>"Let order die,</l>
                  <l>"And let this world no longer be a ſtage</l>
                  <l>"To feed contention in a ling'ring act,</l>
                  <l>"But let one ſpirit of the firſt-born Cain</l>
                  <l>"Reign in all boſoms, that each heart being ſet</l>
                  <l>"On bloody courſes the rude ſcene may end,</l>
                  <l>"And darkneſs be the burier of the dead!"</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:025162_0004_0FCE8C06E43EBF60"/>But if the purport of the poſition be this, that of the pillars which ſupport the fabric of government virtue is the chief, it ſeems to be far diſtant from the truth. The ſecurity of a form of government will be found in itſelf or no where. So powerfully is the heart of man diſpoſed to its own gratifications, that though little virtue is to be found it would not have been ſurpriſing if paſſion had made that little leſs: and it happens fortunately that a moderate portion of virtue in the citizens is ſufficient to the exiſtence of a free government: but it is the buſineſs of legiſlation to render this portion of virtue as active as poſſible and as much as may be to place the common weal out of the graſp of vice by removing temptations to ill, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting duty into intereſt. The proſperity of every ſtate will doubtleſs ever be, caeteris paribus, proportionate to the ſtock of virtue within itſelf; it is therefore alſo the buſineſs of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>giſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ation to increaſe the ſtock of virtue. To this object a well conſtructed republic is favourable in the extreme. The vices of ſome men and the miſcries of others come uſually from the wants of all: but freedom encourages induſtry and plenty, more eſpecially in thoſe happy regions wherein the neceſſaries and comforts of life are obtained with eaſe: and theſe cauſes put a check upon the devices of fraud and rapine: nor do partial inſtances to the contrary invalidate the principle, for were the wants greater ſo would be the crimes. The influence of one private virtue in generating another is well known to men of obſervation; the habit of doing well is formed, and in this, as in all other inſtances, habit induces faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:025162_0005_0FCE8C0855033DF0"/>The private character being well eſtabliſhed the public, where there is no contagion of example, aſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates without an effort. Such governments too prepare honors or rewards for faithful ſervants, and neglect if not infamy for the faithleſs. In republics men are linked together for their mutual ſupport, for the advancement of the common intereſt, and not, as in monarchies and ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocracies, ſervilely employed in exalting haughty thankleſs deſpots upon their proſtrate dignities. They are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the framers, ſometimes the adminiſtrators, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the ſervants, but always the ſource of law. This intimate connexion with the government endears it to the people; all love what bleſſes all; and, as the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of ſuch ſtates relate, they become willing, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times eager, to exhauſt property, health and life, in defence of what they love. The ſucceſſive deputations of the favourites of the people for the tranſaction of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic buſineſs, train up in the ſtate, in a courſe of diſcipline generous and divine, a body of men devoted to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and protection of the human race. Theſe effects, ſo far as they regard the public, have already diſcovered themſelves in the regenerate government of France, in unanimity, firmneſs and magnanimity, entirely without example. The changes in the private character, being unaſſiſted by the fervour which inſpires a public cauſe, muſt await a later hour; yet even theſe changes may be ſuppoſed to be at no great diſtance, ſince we have ſeen the thoughtleſs, frivolous, Pariſian trifler, whom deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm had degraded, ſuddenly reſtored, as by Ithuriel's
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:025162_0006_0FCE8C0CACAB8C00"/>ſpear, to the nobler character of his nature, the manly, ſteady, prudent, citizen of France. The manners of this reformed nation may indeed be expected to loſe ſomething of that ſoftneſs which is impoſed on ſlaves; they will be leſs pliant and inſinuating, but their new found independence will make them more honeſt and ſincere. No longer can man trample on man with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity: unreaſonable, arrogant pretenſions on the one part, baſe compliances and ſubmiſſions on the other, will be baniſhed for ever from among them. Fearleſs of the hand of power the men will become noble and the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men chaſte. They will feel a dignity in their pleaſures and in their ſufferings. Maecenas, at the right hand of a tyrant who might at pleaſure lay him proſtrate in the duſt, felt not that noble pride of heart which is the glory of a French freeman whoſe joys no man preſumes to interrupt, whoſe ſorrows no man dares to inſult. It was obſerved above that one virtue is the offspring of another; between vices there ſubſiſts the ſame relation; let a man be degraded in one particular, (and can ought degrade him more than loſs of freedom?) from that hour his characteriſtics ſhall ſink together. While a free govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment gives licence to the mind to range unfettered through the field of truth, to enjoy at will the feaſt of reaſon and of virtue, ſhe will graſp eagerly at objects worthy of her nature, ſhe will aſſert her divine original. But the head which bows beneath a maſter's yoke ſtrives even to forget the purpoſes of its creation, and ſeeks in fictitious honor, tawdry gewgaws, unmanly occupations,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025162_0007_0FCE8C0D96ACEE80"/>or guilty joys, the poor ſubſtitutes for untaſted happineſs; the moral faculty of man thus ſuffers a temporary ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, a cureleſs ſhock, or utter extinction. With what horror do the patriot freedmen of France look back upon thoſe acts of valor which ſuch gallant ſpirits, miſguided by the demon of deſpotiſm, were ever ready to achieve againſt an unoffending people? How do theſe heroes, enoble as they are in the ſervice of their country and humanity, ſhudder at the melancholy retroſpect of youth, beauty, gaiety and innocence, immured in a loathſome cloiſter to furniſh the trappings of ariſtocratic inſolence? How many fathers reſtored as they are to the charities of nature, weep now with anguiſh over the aſhes of daughters doomed in an evil hour, like the worſt of criminals, to perpetual impriſonment? How willingly would they pay the wealth of worlds to recall them from their dreary graves, whither, perhaps, they had been untimely ſent by moping melancholy, could they but purchaſe an opportunity to expiate the crime by a life of love and beneficence? Surely no government is to be approved which corrupts the morals of its citizens, even though it ſhould promote their happineſs, (which, however, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be its effect;) the government ſhould be ſo formed as to render the citizens virtuous, or they do not deſerve to be happy. The flattering encouragement given to loyalty, as the darling virtue of monarchies, induces the neglect, often the deſtruction, of many others, and an alacrity in obedience, indiſcriminate, mean, flagitious. The immediate ſervants of the monarch are perpetually
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025162_0008_0FCE8C12917FD7D8"/>employed in rivetting faſter the galling chain upon the hands of their fellow vaſſals; in tearing their ſcanty covering from their backs, and ſnatching the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earned morſel from their mouths: And it ſurely is not matter of ſurpriſe, if theſe plundered deſperate wretches prepare to make themſelves amends by every artifice which want and fraud can ſuggeſt. Indeed ſuch govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments cannot act but by the moſt infamous principles and inſtruments; and let us not wonder when the body of the people is found to be influenced by the example of ſuperiors. Republics, on the contrary, cannot tranſact their buſineſs with vigor without the agency of honeſt men; and the citizens cannot chooſe but love, in the perſons of rulers appointed by themſelves, that virtue which is their beſt ſecurity. Theſe legiſlators in their turn will naturally applaud virtue as the moſt effectual mean by which to accompliſh with facility the beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns. Thus does the very form of a good government place virtue under the immediate protection of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether in command or in obedience. Even in England, the beſt contrived eſtabliſhment on earth, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting thoſe of America and France, the power in the hands of the monarch and his means of ſeduction are ſo exorbitant, that the ſtate machine is kept in motion entirely by corruption: And by no other means can it be made to move, until a revolution ſhall take place or a patriot king ſhall fill the throne and employ his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over the other branches of the legiſlature, not to oppreſs the ſubjects but to reform the repreſentation:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025162_0009_0FCE8C146BE486C8"/>for while a majority of the Houſe of Commons ſhall continue to be appointed by five thouſand men, it will be an eaſy taſk to bribe the electors; and this will be done by political proſtitutes, who purchaſe ſeats in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to form the oppoſition which clogs the wheels of government, until they in their turn ſhall be bribed to acquieſcence. How deteſtable a ſyſtem of policy muſt that be which ſtands in need of corruption for its ſupport! and how dangerous to the morals of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom it is adminiſtered! what then muſt be the character and influence of other ſtates which ſtand even far below this in the ſcale of deſpotiſm? Yet has the one enthuſiaſtic admirers, and ſome of the reſt, as the republic of Venice and the late French monarchy, at leaſt warm advocates. <hi>(a)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT has been a matter of enquiry among ſome eminent and curious men, whether democracies or other govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been found moſt favorable to the intereſts of literature; but it is not to my purpoſe to dwell upon the queſtion of ſuperiority in what has gone before, whether as it regards happineſs, virtue or literature; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all governments upon record, prior to thoſe of America and France, have been defective in eſſentials: even the boaſted conſtitution of England, as finally eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed by the boaſted revolution of 1689, contained in itſelf the principles of a rapid diſſolution; or rather inada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate repreſentation was the cureleſs diſtemper, the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, which, though it ſhould not diſſolve the frame,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025162_0010_0FCE8C15E1BD19A8"/>could not fail to deprive it, as it has done, of the vital ſpirit; and it now remains the lifeleſs mummy of a government. <hi>(b)</hi> Theſe pages will be read, if they be read at all, by men who feel that the conſtitution of their country is good becauſe they are happy under it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have too much generous pride to be happy under any inſtitution, the officers of which could oppreſs and plunder them with impunity; becauſe the form of their's is favorable to virtue, the beſt preſerver of the peace of ſociety; and becauſe they find themſelves at liberty at all times to correct errors, to redreſs grievances, and to improve advantages. With all theſe benefits in poſſeſſion, it would little affect ſuch a people to tell them that leſs happy and leſs virtuous nations have been wiſer; this would little diſturb them in the enjoyment of bleſſings which are ineſtimable, and incline them not at all to barter them for qualities which have little compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive value without. But let them be perſuaded that their government may eaſily be rendered eſſentially conducive to the proſperity of literature, a new attainment not only innocent but friendly to the reſt; that thereby they ſhall become wiſer, more virtuous, and more happy, and we cannot doubt that they will eſpouſe the cauſe of wiſdom, virtue, happineſs—in ſhort, their own.</p>
            <p>AMERICA has long been an object of curioſity and wonder, to the enlightened characters of Europe, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the mighty work ſhe boldly attempted, firmly labored, and ably accompliſhed. The great council of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025162_0011_0FCE8C175BC9A9A8"/>the greateſt nation of the world, with a magnanimity which ſhewed them to be qualified for the nobleſt achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, have acknowledged the legiſlators of this infant empire as their maſters in the high buſineſs of civil policy. Even 'midſt the clamors of civil commotion, 'midſt the din of war, the voice of eloquence was heard, and the pen was employed as ſkilfully as the ſword. It muſt therefore occaſion ſurpriſe in ſuch parts of the learned world as are unacquainted with the peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this continent, that ſo few productions of merit, and indeed ſo few of any deſcription, have iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the American preſs ſince the time when the diſappointment of the Britiſh arms ſeemed to leave the citizens at leiſure for literary occupations. The ſervice of the muſes is in all countries, at this day, extremely uprofitable, and when a competency has been obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, it was ſpoken of as an inſtance of extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary felicity. Yet where, as in the old countries, the departments of government are filled with men of family, thoſe of law, phyſic and divinity crouded with profeſſors, and the monopoly of property in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances forbids any advancement by means of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or commerce, literature muſt often become the laſt reſort of indigent genius. But in America, the offices of government are open to merit; and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty being more equally divided and much more eaſily obtained, thoſe who poſſeſs it, apply themſelves to its improvement, thoſe who do not, to the attainment thereof; ſo that the whole community is too active to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:025162_0012_0FCE8C1AB78E9090"/>ſpeculate, except it be immediately in aid of action: thoſe who ſtand in need of gain can obtain little by writing books, and thoſe who do not, are uſually ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther engaged in the ſervice of government, or ſome too indolent, others too ignorant to write. Moreover, the number of perſons in America who can afford to pay the price of books, is not yet ſufficiently large to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the labors of writers who might prove eminently inſtructive and uſeful: for even if their object be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation or the good of human nature, and they ſhould be content to find the bulk of their readers in Europe, there are many ſubjects to which a man might wiſh to apply his ſtudies, which local circumſtances would render little intereſting to foreigners; beſides, that few writers can afford to ſlight the emoluments of literature, of which, if his book were printed in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica he would be deprived by foreign bookſellers who would re-print, or by American if printed abroad. Private patronage too, which has ſometimes produced ſalutary effects, cannot at preſent be expected on this continent: this will rather be found, when found at all, in countries the governments and habits of which (contrarily to ours) encourage the monopoly of large eſtates, which occaſionally prove fountains of liberality, and ſtreams of Helicon too, to the learned. Beſides, when a ſtate by its arbitrary character forbids even its foremoſt citizens to ſtruggle for authority, they are left at full leiſure to admire and foſter men of talents.— Under the old eſtabliſhment of France, more patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:025162_0013_0FCE8C1D570AA6B0"/>was enjoyed than in the free kingdom of Great-Britain. Even in Great-Britain, good writers have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten found favor with the great and been promoted to important and lucrative employments, in conſideration of their literary talents, as in the inſtances of Newton, Locke, Addiſon, Prior, Congreve, and others; and this too without any regard to the peculiar characters of their minds, an example which is not likely, and evidently ought not, to be imitated here. The rich ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical benefices of Europe too, though uſually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon illuſtrious dunces, have ſometimes excited, and rewarded, the ambition of eminent genius; and in like manner ſinecures and penſions. Perhaps too, the characteriſtic modeſty of the American nation, ſo often to be found in its moſt diſtinguiſhed characters, forms another impediment to the efforts of the learned; and thoſe who have been accuſtomed to the inſolence of European greatneſs, muſt obſerve with wonder, that the moſt dignified is the moſt modeſt citizen of the United States. Add to all this, that our government has not yet been twenty years in exiſtence; for I paſs over the time when in its colonial capacity it felt the controlling hand of Britain, like a wayward child; knowing neither the occaſions, nor the motives, nor the ſpirit of great deſigns. Since then all things
<q>"Creep in a ſtealing pace"</q>
toward perfection, little even of that which has been effected where attempts were made, in war and legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, could in ſo ſhort a time have been reaſonably expected.</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:025162_0014_0FCE8C1E557B9688"/>
THESE are ſome of the cauſes, peculiar to America, which operate as diſcouragements from literary achieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; by theſe is ſhe depreſſed in addition to the weight of others common to other countries, which will incidentally come under obſervation as we proceed.</p>
            <p>GREAT as the impediments in the way of genius appear, the moſt zealous friend to literature need not be diſmayed at the proſpect, when he reflects that the power to remove them and to put allurements in their place, is lodged in the hands of thoſe, whoſe honor and intereſts muſt prompt them to their duty. <hi>(c)</hi> To the reſpect and ſupport rendered to learned men in the courts of Auguſtus and queen Ann, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be aſcribed the luſtre of thoſe literary conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which throw a glory round them; and it is remarkable that the prizes offered to dramatic writers by the Athenians, were contended for by Oeſchylus, So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phocles, and Euripides at the ſame time. A conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more admired and gazed at than a ſingle ſtar; the general blaze graces the peculiar ſplendor. This is known to men of uncommon talents, and they are tempted forth to ſhare the honors confered by the faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the time. Rewards, as well lucrative as hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary cannot ſurely be too ſoon, nor more worthily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed than upon diſtinguiſhed genius, employed in the inſtruction and embelliſhment of the human mind; in the ſervice of human nature. Even in this early ſtage of her advancement, America poſſeſſes reſources capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025162_0015_0FCE8C1F970EADF0"/>of furniſhing, without empoveriſhment, no contempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible emolument to the learned; more eſpecially as her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement will be accelerated by the expence. But as ſoon as the debt of the nation ſhall have been diſcharged, then will the ſimple frugal plan of polity which ſecures its intereſts at home, and its diſtance from every formidable power which ſupercedes the neceſſity of expenſive milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry eſtabliſhments for the repulſion of an invader, concur to amaſs treaſures inexhauſtible. So ſmall a number as forty-eight eccleſiaſtical drones in England and Ireland, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually conſume no leſs than one hundred and ſixty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling, in feaſting for the good of the ſouls of the laity, a ſum which bears a conſiderable propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole of the American civil liſt: and the public debt of America amounts not in its principal to ſo much as the intereſt of that of Great Britain; even this may perhaps be extinguiſhed in a moderate ſpace of time by the ſale of vacant lands. From abroad no dangers ſeem to threaten; a rupture with the Spaniards would but involve them in difficulties; deſpots have learnt to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the frown of liberty, and the ſpirit of diſobedience has animated even the blood-hounds which were wont at their command to bathe themſelves in human gore. The reſentment of a nation poſſeſſed of all the materials of naval armaments, being once incurred, the interception of the treaſures of South America, the ſinews of the Spaniſh power, might probably enſue; which loſſes would more-debilitate the parent ſtate than the diſmemberment of the colonies did Great Britain. Spain, with her mines,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025162_0016_0FCE8C225A8565F0"/>is feeble; without her mines and without induſtry, ſhe muſt periſh. It appears then, that we, leſs than any other nation ſtand in need of armies, which are at all times expenſive, and ſometimes dangerous to the ſtate; in which particular we ſhall perhaps prove more fortunate than the gallant French, ſurrounded as they are by mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial neighbours, the rivalſhip among whom has brought into the field in modern times, under the command of a king of France, a ſtronger force than was employed by a Roman emperor to keep the ſubject world in awe; yet was this France but a Province of the empire. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica can better do without an army even than Great-Britain, notwithſtanding her inſular ſituation and her powerful navy. Extenſive naval eſtabliſhments will alſo be found, in general, unneceſſary to the protection of her trade, ſince the perils of her ſea coaſt will forbid the frequent hazard of large fleets of the moſt enterpriſing enemy. Even ſhould the United States for their mutual accommodation ſeparate themſelves into ſeveral diſtinct republics, it is to be expected that the olive branch would, in this age of reform, be preferred to the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary laurel.

            <p>THE plan of propoſing ſpecific theſes to be diſcuſſed by the learned, which has been adopted by ſome private ſocieties, would certainly, as a national concern, and under proper modifications as ſuch, be rendered produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the moſt important benefits to the community. Many excellent and uſeful works would come directly from the inſtitution; and the cauſe of truth would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly proſper by the general principle of literary e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation, which would animate the wiſdom of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; all could not be ſucceſsful, but immediate efforts, or preparatory ſtudies in thoſe who ſhould not ſucceed or who ſhould ultimately decline ſuch conteſts, would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, in many inſtances, light genius into a flame which otherwiſe, like ſparks in flint, had lain for ever dormant. The wiſe, the magnanimous, French nation, while en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in rearing the pillars of their government, which to half the ſurrounding world, ſeemed to totter to their fall, even then they ſlighted not the hallowed rites of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature, but ſacrificed to the divinity, undaunted by the menaces of kings and demons in confederacy. Even monarchs we find ſo ſenſible of the neceſſity of literature, to the aggrandizement and glory of empire that they have often braved the dangers which accompany the light

So flouriſhed Rome under the adminiſtration of Auguſtus and the Antonines, and France under the adminiſtration of Lewis XIVth, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, though but the ape, of wiſdom. But monarchs while they gave countenance to literary men, have ever ſtriven to point their attention as wide as poſſible of thoſe objects which moſt immediately concerned the felicity of the people; to them has been uſually allowed juſt, light enough to diſcern the means of exalting the empire and the tyrant, but ſeldom ſo much as might be ſufficient to exalt the empire and the nation. It has ever been the purpoſe of princes to keep their ſubjects below the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of human nature; wiſe they might eſteem, noble they might aſpire at, freedom: ſo that kings and kingdoms were made illuſtrious by the labour and valour of thoſe hands which ſtill remained in chains. Sometimes the accurſed oppreſſors of the human race, under the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, as it might ſeem, of ſome good angel who had aſſumed a devil's ſhape, have deviated into good. Deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raſhly of the baſeneſs of humanity, they have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, to ſet at large, in their dominions the Voltaires, the Rouſſcaus, the Monteſquieus, the champions of their kind, like avenging deities, to fright or blaſt them on their thrones. How different is the condition, how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent the intereſts of the ruler in a government eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:025162_0019_0FCE8C2708D2CA00"/>in the rights and erected for the uſe of the citizens? Legiſlation becomes in this inſtance the tender office of a parent providing for the welfare of his children; when inſtruction has been given, the inſtructor feels himſelf exalted by the honors which his pupil gains; the ſhines with reflected light; and the legiſlator, when he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the claſs of ordinary citizens, will glow with honeſt pride in contemplating in his ſucceſſor the faculties improved, the wiſdom created, by himſelf, which ſhall then have become neceſſary to his own ſecurity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in his humbler ſphere. In ſuch a government, the greatneſs of the ſtate, the glory of the rulers, and the happineſs of the people, are all inſeparably blended. The influence of learning in the preſervation of liberty is a ſecret to nobody, ſo that it is not only conducive to the proſperity of a well conſtructed government, but even eſſential to its exiſtence; and it muſt be ſtrange indeed when ſuch a government ſhall not in turn advance the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of learning. Though, for the reaſons mentioned before, I ſhall not enter upon the queſtion whethey free republics have been more favorable to the cauſe of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature than abſolute monarchies; and ſhall content my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with knowing that it is their intereſt, their duty, and entirely at their option to be ſo, yet it may be remarked by the way, that the immenſe dominions of Rome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, during one whole age, even under the milder ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of Hadrian and the Antonines, only one great writer; and it is not to be ſuppoſed, that either of thoſe emperors would have been content than wiſdom
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025162_0020_0FCE8C2B492E9600"/>ſhould roam at will through thoſe fields of ſcience which yield nutritious fruits and furniſh antidotes to the poiſon of the great: for monarchs
<q>Who bear their faculties ſo meek,</q>
are ſeldom leſs diſpoſed for that to graſp them in their hands and to make head againſt reformers. A few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have abdicated thrones from diſguſt, vanity, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed patriotiſm, or the apprehenſion of the puniſhment of uſurpation, and left them to be ſcuffled for by other ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants; this Scylla did: others have retired in a fit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious frenzy, like Charles Vth, of Germany: but how ſmall is the number of thoſe who have been content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign a portion of that authority, which however ſafely it might be ſuppoſed to be lodged in their own hands, muſt deſcend with extreme hazard to their ſucceſſors; as the Roman diadem from Auguſtus to Tiberius, and from An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonine to the execrable Commodus. The reſtraints which the luſt of dominion does uſually throw upon the efforts of the learned, have accordingly often benumbed or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticated, the intellects of man in a manner unknown in the hiſtories of free civilized governments, though defective in their form; and, when the intellects eſcape this influence, the moral faculty, as obſerved above, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the rudeſt ſhocks. Much of the court favor obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Auguſtan wits, may fairly be aſcribed to the flatteries which degrade their writings; and accordingly they ſtand upon record as
<q>The wiſeſt, brighteſt, meaneſt of Mankind.</q>
It is the buſineſs of a republic on the other hand, to call
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:025162_0021_0FCE8C2C88F09AD0"/>action, for its own purpoſes, for the beſt purpoſes the good and glory of the nation, the choiſeſt and moſt powerful faculties of mind. While in monarchical ſtates the ſubjects are inſtructed in all the myſteries of ſin and hell, for the deſolation of the earth and the injury of their fellow creatures by a Frederick or a Machiavel. In republics every incentive of intereſt and virtue diſpoſes the rulers and the ruled to promote the common good by wiſe and moral exerciſes of the ſoul.</p>
            <p>As nothing but learning can enſure the poſſeſſion of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſo alſo can liberty be defended from the mischiefs of licentiouſneſs, as a pretended friend the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of enemies, by nothing but learning. The true enlightened republican or lover of the public weal, is equally friendly to liberty and abhorrent to licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: in an ignorant multitude, the feeling differs; the evils which come from the intemperate uſe of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt good, are overlooked by theſe, or when foreſeen, are too often diſregarded. In arbitrary governments, the ſlighteſt inſtance of licentiouſneſs incurs infamy or puniſhment, and theſe are uſually proportionate to the barbariſm of the people; but in free ſtates it is treated with indulgence, as "an excreſcence on the eye of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which ſhould be touched with a gentle, with a trembling hand, leſt we injure the eye, leſt we injure the body upon which it is apt to appear." The envy which follows wealth, is in ſome inſtances an incitement to jealouſy, hate, and diſorder; in others, it is a ſlaviſh
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025162_0022_0FCE8C2DEB0C5ED8"/>opiate of ſtill more baneful operation: both theſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of wealth, may in ſome degree be controlled by the exhibition of a worthier object of deſire and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. If a certain reſpect for wealth, be ſuppoſed a needful check upon the turbulence of poverty, yet it ſhould be remembered, that when education ſhall have become general, and a certain portion of improvement ſhall have advanced the pretenſions of ordinary men, it may become as difficult, as in a ſtate of the moſt ſordid lawleſs ignorance, to preſerve order in a multitude of proud diſcerning freemen, glorying in their indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and their might; unleſs the diſtinction obtained through eminent intellectual accompliſhments, by ſome of thoſe whom fortune has neglected, ſhall ſooth and comfort the reſt, and reconcile them to the ſenſe of infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority. Nothing can ſo well promote the equality of rank, ſo much talked of and applauded yet ſo little known in republics, as the univerſality and the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of literature. The dignity of wiſdom rendered Cincinn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tus venerable at his plough, but an untaught ruſtic, muſt ſeek in vain for ſuch reſpect. The more learning ſhall be encouraged, the more will it be honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the more will it be coveted and attempted, the poor will become learned that they may be exalted, the rich that they may not be degraded, and that they may eſcape the ridicule of being diſtinguiſhed blockheads. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary race of men, forms the ſtrength of every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and that ſtrength is greater, which is animated by freedom; but what will be the ſtrength of that country,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025162_0023_0FCE8C2F54B521D8"/>the ordinary inhabitants of which are free, well inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and enamoured of a government which reſpects their condition and honours their improvements. Wealth, on the contrary, mere unqualified wealth, but helps to ſap the baſis of government by promoting luxury, and, where it is practicable, by inviting invaſion. In the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution war, the Britiſh arms ſuffered the moſt formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cheecks from the citizens of the ſtates which were leaſt wealthy, and, perhaps, beſt informed: they were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diſtinguiſhed in England, as <hi>the neſt of hornets;</hi> ſhe learnt indeed to rue their ſtings, and to her did Boſton become a term of diſmay, as Carthage formerly to Rome. Freedom, the beſt treaſure of the brave, was their's, and that being loſt, they had been poor. <hi>(d)</hi> It were much to be deſired, by the warmeſt literary zealot, that the firſt place in the eſteem of mankind ſhould be given to virtue itſelf; for an abundant portion of moral, with a much ſmaller of intellectual excellence, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide more ample funds of human felicity, than a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rſe proportion of theſe advantages; but a complete tranſmutation of the nature of man being impracticable, and the love of wealth and fame being predominant paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions therein, he muſt be acted upon as he is; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, literature ſhould be made to lead to theſe objects, that virtue may flouriſh under its influence. By means of literature and virtue, will the bleſſings of order and good government, among others, be beſt underſtood, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued, and preſerved. In deſpotic ſtates, the ſame power which bends the neck to the yoke, can, by its dependent
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025162_0024_0FCE8C335ABD2B48"/>chain, reſtrain the rage of paſſion and mollify the manners of the people. But in free ſocieties, wherein each man is the carver of his own fortunes and needs ſmall aid from others, the citizens are much in danger of paſſing from independence to ferocity in public concerns, and from ſincerity to rudeneſs in private. In ſuch ſocieties, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the arts which ſweeten and embelliſh life, the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which
<q>emollit mores nec ſinit eſſe feros,</q>
cannot be too highly rated. How large a portion of the tranquillity of the freeſt community depends, even upon the manners and cuſtoms by which its ſocial intercourſe is ruled? Liberty, like wealth, may be poſſeſſed without enjoyment in Spartan ſeverity, or puritanic gloom; and, by the alteration of a word, to either bleſſing might be applied the compliment of Horace,
<q>Di tibi divitias dederunt artemque fruendi.</q>
To the advantages poſſeſſed, in theſe particulars, by the French nation, were they indebted for ſuch pleaſures as they were enabled to glean under the preſſure of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient dynaſty; and the abſence of theſe advantages, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciates in a remarkable manner, others held by the freer Engliſh. In the Engliſh government, there is oppreſſion enough to excite indignation, and liberty enough to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of complaint and other conſequences of ill humour; two cauſes, which may very well be ſuppoſed to forbid ſoftneſs and ſuavity of deportment, and to mar the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of literary accompliſhments which they poſſeſs. Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not enfeebled by ſuch diſabilities, furniſhes the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025162_0025_0FCE8C349611D760"/>of refined diſcourſe, and throws a very happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the commerce of men. In defect of this attainment, the Turkiſh grandee is conſtrained to fill the ſad vacuity of ignorance with opium, coffee, and tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co; the American ſavage with intoxicating liquors. Similar conſolations muſt be the wretched reſort of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man, whoſe attention is not guided to liberal enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in a government which leaves him to the choice of all, and wherein the worſt are ever at his command. Who has not ſeen the toaſt and circulating bottle made the ſubſtitutes of wit? Who daily ſees not drunkenneſs the occupation of unlettered ſolitude? Now to a literary character, intemperance is both unneceſſary, and in a more than ordinary meaſure, inconvenient—becauſe, it induces an incapacity of its favorite enjoyments; ſo that pleaſures which are hurtleſs and perpetual, are received in exchange for others which are neither. How often too, do the reputations of the innocent become the victims of dulneſs and colloquial barrenneſs, when erroneouſly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be ſacrificed to malignity?</p>
            <p>IN the encouragement of learning, the preference, beyond queſtion, is due to thoſe branches thereof, which miniſter moſt immediately to the public good; but ſo precious is human wit, that no ſpecies is without its va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue; and of thoſe which are in leaſt eſteem for utility, I ſhall firſt ſpeak. Genius will extract ſomething valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble from what might be deemed worthleſs by another; as the bee, honey from a thiſtle. Knowledge of every
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025162_0026_0FCE8C3617844380"/>kind, has upon ſome former occaſion, been applied to good purpoſe, and may in ſome future event be applied to better. Such is the affinity which ſubſiſts between the various departments of ſcience, that no one can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced incapable of ſuccouring another. Many modern improvements in anatomy have been derived from the optician; by him alſo, has the aſtronomer been furniſhed with inſtruments; and the aſtronomer, in his turn, gives help to navigators. It may be in the power of a chymiſt to throw ſuch lights upon the art of huſbandry, as may double the revenues of a ſtate. Botany may afford aids to the practice of phyſic, which may reſcue millions from the grave, the ſalvation of only one of whom would have won the Roman civic crown: the bleſſings which have been ſhowered upon the human race by the diſcovery of the Peruvian bark alone do indeed ſtand beyond the reach of calculation. To the ſtudy of bota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny will many ingenious men be incited by the magic of poetic numbers in <hi>the Botanic Garden,</hi> and the poem itſelf is the offspring of the botanic art. A general paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for literature, perhaps, formed in Dr. Franklin that habit of enquiry which led him to the ſtudy of politics; and his literary powers may have procured him that favor among the great in France which he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed in an eminent degree, and may have qualified him for the negociation which freed his country. <hi>(e)</hi> Polite literature, poſſeſſes no direct powers which can deviſe a ſcheme of ſtate, yet can proſper what has been deviſed, and ſave a ſinking land. The late lord Chatham was
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025162_0027_0FCE8C3946783448"/>a great ſtateſman, a great deſigner in political buſineſs; but it is well known, that he was indebted for the effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient co-operation of party to his reſiſtleſs eloquence; the good applauded, and the guilty trembled; the flimſy ſophiſtry of proſtitution, diſolved before his power like a ſpider's web. <hi>(f)</hi> Unfortunately, vice in the human character, is a natural weed of the ſoil; virtue a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der exotic, which muſt be reared with the moſt careful culture. Virtue muſt not only be known, but recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; and the diſtinction between the charms of truth, attired in homely veſtments, or graced in all the ornaments of rhetoric and poetry, fails not to ſtrike the eye of an ordinary beholder; but to a man of taſte, is intereſting in the extreme. In the performances of the blackſmith and the ſteel worker, the houſe painter and the hiſtory painter, the metal and the paint are the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials in either caſe; but the ſkill with which they are handled, determines the character of the labourer or the artiſt.

It is eaſy to convince a man that certain modes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct are commendable, but to go further and perſuade him to adopt them, this is the achievement of a maſter. The Athenians needed no inſtructor to acquaint them it was their duty, inſtead of waſting their time at public ſhews, to ruſh forth in defence of the liberty of their country, againſt the encroachments of Philip; this they had known before; but it demanded the powers of Demoſthenes to impel them to the field. This inſtance
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025162_0028_0FCE8C3A99324D58"/>of the uſe of elocution, is the more remarkable, as the orator incited others to acts of valor, to which he was proved himſelf unequal: the Athenian army obtained the honors of the field, while the man of eloquence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitately fled. In the art of perſuaſion there is this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage too, that while it can extinguiſh vice and confirm virtue, it poſſeſſes no injurious influence over the actions of the good. When human nature is found in a ſtate of innocence and felicity, as in the inſtance of the ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able inhabitants of Pelew, and if, in a ſtate of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, any ſecurity in theſe advantages could be poſſeſſed, it might perhaps afflict the warmeſt friend of learning to ſee arts intruded upon peace, creating wants faſter than they can be gratified, and kindling paſſions which will need new arts to mitigate their rage. But in an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſtage of ſociety, when the objects of pride, ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, envy, jealouſy, and voluptuouſneſs, have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready introduced, it becomes neceſſary to adminiſter ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able remedies to theſe inveterate maladies. The polite eſſays of Addiſon and Steele, are ſuppoſed to have been happily inſtrumental in meliorating, at leaſt the manners, or what are called by the French, <hi>la petit morale,</hi> of the people of England: and when we reflect on the ſalutary influences of gentle amiable demeanor in ſocial inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, this will be admitted as no inconſiderable inſtance of the benefit of fine writing. If to that nation, as has been hinted above, the aids of literary accompliſhments be peculiarly requiſite on account of the perſonal free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it poſſeſſes, and if there be alſo an indiſpenſible ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025162_0029_0FCE8C3D2B3C40A8"/>for theſe aids in our freer and more popular go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, wherein the citizens are ſo much at liberty to indulge thoſe licentious aſperities which mar their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual peace; ſo alſo will the ſucceſs of the application bear a proportion to the character of the literature ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered. Philoſophy will ſtrengthen, but wit, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, poetry, muſt refine; as the higheſt poliſh comes from the ſmootheſt or the ſofteſt ſubſtances. Even the philoſopher or politician, therefore, if he be the father of the people and make proviſion for the ſecurity of their happineſs, will not heſitate to become the patron of the fine arts. But even to the deſigns of the philoſopher and politician, as we ſee, does eloquence afford her aid. Poetry too, in her turn aſſiſts the orator,

The efficacy of ſuch magic in preſerving a manly national character ſo eſſential to the ſecurity of freedom, was ſo well known to a king of England, the invader of the gallant Welſh, that the royal ſavage ordered all their bards to be put to death, to facilitate the conqueſt of the country. Among the ancient Germans too, the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of poetic tranſports, in generating a martial ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, was often employed; and there are ſpecific victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on record, ſuppoſed to have been won by poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. A modern politican has aſcribed very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful effects to the popular ſongs of later times: Perhaps the Engliſh have been indebted to the military ſong of <hi>Hearts of Oak,</hi> for ſome of their naval victories, and we know the ça ira of the French to be their Io Poean. The national ſongs of North-Britain thrill through the veins of every Scot; and ſome martial Caledonian ſtrain will ſhortly pierce a Brunſwick's ear like witching incan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. <hi>(g)</hi> A correct taſte aſks poems in "an higher mood." Poetry in other times and governments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the rights of man were unknown or trampled on,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025162_0031_0FCE8C40044B4610"/>having ſometimes taken a wrong direction, miſled and hurt mankind. The morals of the two great epic poems of antiquity, are bad in eſſentials, and took their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions from the licentious manners of the ages in which they were compoſed. In Homer's time, predatory expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, or what we ſhould term piracies, ſeem (and they are ſpoken of by him without blame,) to have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as a reputable occupation. It is no wonder then that the carrying fire and ſword into the country of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offending people to recover a royal ſtrumpet ſhould, in compariſon with an ordinary robbery, be applauded as an heroic exploit; more eſpecially as ſhe was the wife of one of thoſe confederating monarchs, who came into the world for no other purpoſe than to tread upon the necks of ſuch dutiful warriors. It is well known too that, among the Romans, the conquerors and butchers of innocent nations were held in the higheſt eſteem as the moſt virtuous characters alive; and that too in caſes wherein not even their tyrant had given offence (whoſe guilt however ſhould in no caſe have been avenged in the perſons of his ſubjects;) it was very natural there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Latinus's breach of promiſe when he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed his daughter ſhould be made a ſufficient pretext whereby the pious Aeneas took occaſion to involve a harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs race of men in all the horrors of deſolation and ſlaughter. No material alteration had taken place in political philoſophy when in an evil hour Alexander of Macedon came like a peſtilence into the world to plague mankind. By Ariſtotle he was taught to delight in

                   rendition="simple:additions"/>Homer: unfortunately in his Achilles he delighted more and learnt from him to bathe the face of earth in human gore. It was the boaſt of Virgil that this was the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of his country,
<q>Parcere ſubjectis &amp; debellare ſuperbos;</q>
which may certainly be fairly tranſlated thus; "to ſpare the abject unreſiſting wretch and put the brave to death;" or thus, "to degrade the noble mind to ſlavery but not murder the man enſlaved." The worſt part of this hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed maxim, but not always the beſt, ruled the waſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life of Alexander. Sometimes indeed he would ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs himſelf and, as in the caſe of Porus, he would ſeize upon a kingdom like a robber and reſtore it like a hero. We on the contrary are ſo happy as to live in an age of the world when the human mind has aſſumed in politics and morals, ſome moderate portion of the light of reaſon; enough at leaſt to diſcern that a great rogue is much more deteſtable than a ſmall one, as the treaſures of a world exceed the value of a purſe of gold, and a million of lives out number the life of an individual. No longer are the Iliad and Aeneid peruſed as exemplars in moral, but in poetic, excellence;

But being thus nobly employed by a bard who riſes with the riſing theme, who ſhall not feel the great ſublime of poetry and virtue? Too long have witching numbers urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the brave to mutual ſlaughter; when ſhall their better influence bind them in friendly league and drive them like a tempeſt on the foes of wretched man? When with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the ſtateſman from the wicked wiles which enſnare unwary innocence? When fill his mind with patriot plans to bleſs the country he inhabits, and urge him to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, not diſturb, his fellow men abroad in all the good they know, while he allures them to participate in more? When lead the philoſopher to meditate on fatal errors which enſlave the mind, and with a ſkilful, patient, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hand, to pluck them off? When ſooth the miniſter of the God of mercy to dwell in charity with his neighbour, to pity his frailties becauſe he is a man, to wipe the tear from his eye becauſe he is a fellow creature, to revile him not at all?</p>
            <p>THE moral and political uſes of fine writing have been mentioned firſt as they deſerve; but as a certain portion of pleaſure is neceſſary to man, and that too even as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement in the diſcharge of his duty, and as in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of thoſe pleaſures which are innocent he is apt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in the guilty, the moſt rigid politician, philoſopher, or moraliſt, will ſcarcely object to the propagation of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite ſtudies even as ſources of delight. When the patriot ſhall have done his utmoſt in the moſt momentous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of legiſlation, much will ſtill remain to be done
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025162_0034_0FCE8C45E2484690"/>to ſoften the condition of human nature. Nor can the labour of philoſophic exerciſes be ſuſtained perpetually; the mind muſt ſeek occaſional recreation in gentle elegant amuſement. Rough is the path of life, tender the feet of man; it is not ſufficient that ſharp flints and craggy protuberances ſhall be broken away; but, that man may walk cheerily on his journey, ſoft herbage muſt ſometimes comfort his foot-ſteps, and roſes blow amidſt innumerable thorns. He is often compelled to ſteal from ſad reality to ſcenes of fancied bliſs, there to lay down awhile his load of cares, and ſnatch a ſhort repoſe which like night<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſleep fits him to bear a weight otherwiſe above his ſtrength. The ſad conſequences of melancholy appear often in debility both corporal and mental; and nothing conduces more to the ſanity of the whole human ſyſtem, the Mens ſana in corpore ſano, than cheerfulneſs and mirth. The productions of comic writers are therefore happily fitted for the comfort and relief of thoſe whoſe need is greateſt. A traveller obſerving a man at a diſtance reading a book and uſing very extravagant geſtures pointed him out to his companion, who replied that the book muſt be Don Quixote or the man muſt be mad; the former proved to be the truth. It is evident then that not only the ſtrength, but the beauty of literature al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, merits the patronage of the public even when it ſtands alone and is viewed merely as an object of delight. Rhet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oric and poetry however we have ſeen may be employed in a direct manner for the moſt important purpoſes; and even wit, too often deemed a pleaſing trifler, can ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025162_0035_0FCE8C492376A4D0"/>advance the beſt deſigns of virtue, policy, or phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy. Mirth, cheerfulneſs, and health, are followed uſually by benevolence; and actions become pleaſures which were duties before. A joyous character is general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too happy in the pleaſing habit of his ſoul to attempt an augmentation of his bliſs by a wilful injury of others; and ſeldom but in gloomy tempers have we detected atrocious guilt. Nothing but the black horrors of flagitious bigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could ſo naturally have incited Philip II. of Spain to the maſſacre of a nation and the murder of his ſon. The ſucceſs with which Cervantes combated the mad ſpirit of chivalry is well known; and it is certain that to wilful pertinacious error the ſubtilties of philoſphy and the thunders of eloquence are leſs terrible than the ſhafts of ridicule. As much good may be done by well directed wit, ſo alſo may much miſchief be prevented as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of thoſe baleful productions which, being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by all the graces of fine writing and thoſe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries in which voluptuous paſſions delight, have long been, and ſtill continue, in very improper hands. In the beſt eſteemed novels publiſhed in ſtates whoſe habits and manners differ materially from ours, not unfrequently does an inconſtant wife ſo pathetically bewail the guilt in which ſhe has been involved by the neglect of an huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, probably too neither young nor handſome, that the heart becomes too much engaged in the diſtreſſes of the lovely mourner to be at leiſure to condemn her crimes; and to a peice of this deſcription has the author prefixed this notable motto, Quibus pretium faceret ipſa fragilitas.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025162_0036_0FCE8C4C34315BD0"/>The gallants of their wittieſt comedies are commonly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by every effort of the poet amiable in proportion to the number of families they may plunge in woe; or the number of cuckolds which, as they gayly phraſe it, they may be ſo ſkilful as to <hi>dub.</hi> The brightneſs of Wycherly, Congreve, and Vanbrugh, we muſt admire but as a flame which while it warms may burn. There is certainly wit enough in our own citizens if means were uſed to draw it forth; and, as it is not neceſſary that a man ſhould be wicked that he may be witty, there can be no doubt that it may be applied to the beſt purpoſes, among others the expulſion of what has hitherto been applied to the worſt. A combination of the gayer and graver faculties of the mind is moreover found not unfrequently in the ſame genius. In Homer were united judgment, fancy, and humour. In Shakeſpeare and Horace, judgment, fancy, wit, and humour. Every intellectual excellence deſerves to be rated high. The ruby is not the leſs a jewel becauſe it is not a diamond. It happens unfortunately however in literature that men of conſiderable, but of different talents, do all take delight in degrading thoſe poſſeſſed by others that their own may riſe in the compariſon; yet by their fruitleſs efforts to aſſume the ſlighted character betray in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary reſpect. Schiſmatic rancour in literature as in religion endangers the common intereſt by inducing an opinion of weakneſs in that wherein none can aſcertain the ſeat of ſtrength. Public patronage extended to each department of knowledge would at once eſtabliſh, improve, and enforce, the claims of all.</p>

Let us now reſume the queſtion on the propriety of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding incitements to the purſuit of literature in general.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſpoken above of the neceſſity of giving perſonal dignity to literary characters as ſuch, the advantage whereof appeared in a very ſtriking manner in France, before the revolution; where a Voltaire, a Rouſſeau, a Marmontel, might always aſſure themſelves, though not always of pecuniary advantages, at leaſt of ſuch a portion of conſolatary reſpect in the capacity of literati, as would certainly have been denied to the moſt opulent obſcure ignorant. But I have ſaid that in free governments the leading citizens are uſually too much occupied by politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal engagements to devote much time to the ſociety of the learned; and the diſtribution of property through all branches of every family leaves no reſources for very ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual patronage. Nay even in one of thoſe countries which from the difference of circumſtances might be
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:025162_0039_0FCE8C5359561198"/>expected to abound in patrons we have ſeen the monarch himſelf enraptured with the productions of a poet written in ſupport of his unſtable cauſe, yet this royal critic while he reveled in the luxuries of a world heightened by the wit of Butler, could view without emotion his neglected Bard, languiſh without conſolation or hope, in want, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and impriſonment. In free ſtates too the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of accumulating wealth and the pageantry of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful men operate with great power in withdrawing the attention of the community from literature and literary men. Beſides, let us ſuppoſe that intellectual accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall obtain a meaſure of reſpect as ample as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with a ſtate of indigence, yet will property be ever found neceſſary to the <hi>full</hi> attainment of their deſerts. Though wealth as ſuch may in ſome caſes be eſtimated at no very high rate by a man of abſtract views, yet if he be a man of the world he cannot be inſenſible of the value of that which is the only mean whereby juſtice can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in favor of qualities really reſpectable. Relative advantages only can give effect to the higheſt of thoſe which are perſonal. In thoſe ſimple governments where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in virtue and genius were in themſelves competent to the dignity of a citizen, wherein a philoſopher could be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and a dictator ſought for, in a cottage, wealth might have proved but a troubleſome ſuperfluity; but the ſubſequent degeneracy of manners and prevalence of luxury ſhewed without doubt to every man of talents, even to him who ſtood firſt among the orators, and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt among the ſtateſmen, of Rome, fortified too in phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy

and ſuch diſintereſted magnanimity might well be upheld among ſpirits great enough to accept great faculties as ſubſtitutes for wealth, and reſpect an indigent genius; but the poet himſelf, bleſſed as he was with that philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic acumen which has been the wonder of ſo many ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ages, betrays, in his fond frequent mention of his labine farm, a deep ſenſe of its indiſpenſible neceſſity; and without that he had probably been without much of his perſonal dignity though the favorite of an emperor, and the friend of his prime miniſter.

Who doubts that Voltaire was indebted to his handſome eſtabliſhment at Ferney, for much of that perſonal diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which he fondly accepted perhaps as a writer? Stript of this advantage would the travelling critic, ſpeaking probably of what he did not underſtand, have given him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the trouble to pay his compliments to him as "un plus grand monſtre?" Had Otway been a man of fortune would he not have been courted to feed on dainties at the tables of the great? But alas! he was poor, therefore for his own could he not obtain a morſel of bread until ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by famine he was ſuffocated in attempting to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.

Have we not juſt ſeen a noble tragic poet, expiring with hunger, while eminent players were diſtempered with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion? Compare the condition of the greateſt of drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic authors with that of the greateſt of dramatic actors; compare the conditions of Shakeſpeare and Garrick. The firſt was many years engaged as a player in the houſe for which he wrote; probably with a ſcanty ſalary as he acted indifferently; and he retired in declining life, with ſomething which ſeems to have been thought <hi>conſiderable</hi> (perhaps for a <hi>poet.</hi>) The other was ever amaſſing trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures from his entrance to his exit, and quitted the ſtage in ſplendor. Now, in a compariſon of their reſpective ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, we will do the beſt for Garrick, and it will be this; like the horſes of the ſun he breathed from his lips celeſtial fire, the emanations of the genius of Shakeſpeare like the ſun himſelf. Not merely are eminent writers overlooked, they are often avoided in the commerce of men: thoſe who are not wealthy themſelves ſhun ſuch characters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are poor; thoſe who are wealthy ſhun them becauſe they poſſeſs ſuperior faculties, and becauſe they will not loſe in their preſence any portion of the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which gold confers. "Dont you ſee (ſays a drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic poet) how worthleſs great men, and dull rich rogues avoid a witty man of ſmall fortune? Why he looks like a writ of enquiry into their titles and eſtates." Nothing is ſo diſguſting to blockheads whether rich or poor, as the honeſt pride of genius: they can grant no indulgence to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:025162_0043_0FCE8C5A88E5B1D8"/>a paſſion generated by merits which exceed the reach of their comprehenſion. Men are more ready to love than to admire or reſpect; becauſe admiration and reſpect are generally tributes to a ſuperior; yet property is often ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the attainment of a companion's love. Every inſtance of attention from a man of fortune is uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as a kindneſs, and affection is the offspring; from all others it is received as a right and forgotten. Thus while the wealthy fool obtains an admirer and friend in every man he meets, the needy wit ſtands comfortleſs and alone, becauſe he ſcorns to bend to the haughty brow of knavery or dulneſs. To ſuch a man neglect is the mildeſt deſtiny, contempt and ridicule the moſt probable.</p>
            <p>WERE the condition of authors who are citizens of a free government to remain unnoticed ſo far as they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves may feel, the ſervices they render the ſtate give them the ſtrongeſt claims to public notice. When ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and orators aſſiſt in the councils of the nation the public readily furniſhes their eſtabliſhments; yet does the dignity of the office alone requite them, and future honors and rewards ſtill wait them. But writers by whoſe labors they have been taught to lighten on the cabinet, or thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the ſenate, what has been the recompence of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to them? Want, miſery, deſpair. In literature alone of all the departments of induſtry does the laborer toil in vain. The citizen whoſe taſk has no motive but intereſt, no end but the accommodation of a few neighbors, is ſure of plenty and may hope for opulence: while he who reclaims the wild chaos of prejudice, ignorance and error;

The author of the <hi>Social Compact,</hi> a book which has concurred with other cauſes in the emancipation of a mighty people, ſuſtained his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuable life on a pittance earned by copying the notes of muſicians who battened on the favor of the public. The <hi>Spirit of Laws</hi> has been ſo much dreaded by the enemies of human peace, that the publication thereof has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in ſeveral of the deſpotiſms in Europe; of ſo much conſequence to the world may prove the written wiſdom of a ſingle man. Without the declaration of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the French alliance had not been obtained, and American liberty had periſhed, and with it the hopes of the ſurrounding world. This meaſure has been admitted to have been cauſed in a great degree by Mr. Paine's pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet entitled <hi>Common Senſe;</hi> yet has this induſtrious and diſintereſted writer emerged from the perſonal obſcurity to which he was condemned by his fellow citizens into the favor and protection of a foreign nation. The produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of genius even when they prove lucrative do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enrich the author but frequently either a bookſeller, or at ſome diſtant period, a commentator. Milton's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits from the nobleſt poetical production in the Engliſh, or perhaps in any other, language, amounted to no more than thirty pounds: the time employed in the compoſition of
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:025162_0045_0FCE8C5EC9F0AD80"/>the piece was ten years: three pounds a year then was the compenſation of the labours of the greateſt poet upon earth, who was believed to have been employed in the ſervice of God and man. Sometime after this a commentary not equal in value to the ten beſt lines of the work, was ſold for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral thouſand pounds. But, gain who may by litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, (more eſpecially that which is moſt uſeful) the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic are ſure to obtain by far the ampleſt ſhare either in the form of pleaſure or of profit. The profits of the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of the mariner's compaſs and quadrant would not weigh with thoſe of the commercial world ſo much as a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a mountain. Since then the ſtate muſt ever be the heir of learning it will do wiſely to improve its funds. Patents for the conſtruction of uſeful machines have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently drawn ſhowers of gold upon their inventors; but the principles upon which they were conſtructed, whence were theſe derived? From books written by tattered, houſeleſs, ſtarving ſervants of mankind. Is it not aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing that the profeſſion of literature, the only one which miniſters directly to the good of the ſtate, ſhould by any good government be ſuffered to remain without a recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence? The gates of glory admit as readily the votaries of law and phyſic as the votaries of the muſes: but how great the diſparity in pecuniary advantages?

Nor is it more candid to cenſure a writer who in his choice determines in favor of the gainful walks of learning than a lawyer or phyſician who quits them all for his more gainful walk.

Until the lucrative departments of buſineſs and genius ſhall have been filled up can it be doubted that the niggard ſoil of literature ſhall be left uncultured? While men of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed talents are thus profitably employed can any hope ſurvive that they may be removed without a lure? But in a country of ſuch vaſt extent and with an increaſing population who ſhall declare the time when agriculture, commerce, phyſic, and law, ſhall want employment. That ſuch is the extent and ſuch the population of our country is matter for animating reflection, but upon lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature muſt it depend at laſt whether the character of an immenſe empire ſhall be Attick or Boeotian. Nor can any apprehenſion be reaſonably entertained leſt the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of learning ſhould crowd this department with profeſſors. This patronage may indeed give independence and domeſtic comforts to genius, but no emoluments
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025162_0048_0FCE8C65D049C8D8"/>likely to attend it in favor of the beſt and moſt ſucceſsful writer are likely to enrich him like either of the other profeſſions: whatever miniſters moſt immediately to the neceſſities and intereſt of men will ever find the ſureſt, moſt effectual ſupport. In a government like the late French monarchy where lucrative vocations crowned not the ableſt or the wealthieſt man with honor, while the learned were held in reverence, a genius found ſome temptation to forego ignoble gain and enter into a ſtate of ſplendid poverty: but in free ſtates ſuch purſuits en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich, promote, and dignify, the citizen; and he muſt be an enthuſiaſt indeed who ſhall be diſpoſed to embrace a ſcience not highly portioned when rich and noble rivals are within his reach. Circumſtanced as the profeſſion of literature is at preſent every "fool to fame" is in emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent danger of diſappointed ambition, in neglected, cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, hopleſs, poverty.

How many men of diſtinction in the learned and the faſhionable world are there to be found who would quit the ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſcenes of luxury and pride, to ſeek the ſad retreat wherein a needy unſucceſsful humbled party man was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoling himſelf in the ſtudy of poetry?

Even praiſe the cheapeſt prize of wit, the boon which coſts the wealthy bloockhead nothing, ſhall be withheld from him who wants all other comforts: but deck his ſtate with gold, the beſt embelliſhment of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, then ſhall the glittering tribe admit his claims and recognize ſuperior worth: a genius then becomes their Mercury, their magnus Apollo; and, like Aeneas, only with a golden bough can he enter the elyſium of their favor. Having obtained this advantage he ſtands upon high ground whence to repel the ſhocks of envy, jealouſy and dulneſs, in literary warfare; and when he ſhall have ſubdued their power they will but ſwell his triumph like captives at a victor's car. From this high ground too will a wiſe man be better heard when in ſome momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous hour the exigencies of the ſtate call for counſel from the wiſe.

By cool diſpaſſionate reaſonings upon important points, ſuch writers might often help to prepare the public mind for a final diſcuſſion and deciſion; allaying by ſuch means much of that diſputatious animoſity which firſt invades the peace of ſocial life, and, after, impedes moſt perilouſly the advancement of public buſineſs. The power of virtuous wiſdom in filling a ſtate with felicity has never yet been completely diſplayed: and in free unanimous governments no dangers are to be apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the productions of flagitious genius; for where men are accuſtomed to think for themſelves it is as diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to perſuade them from their true intereſts as it is to perſuade them thereto where others have been allowed to think for them: and this difficulty grows with the growth of diſſeminated wiſdom. Men of experience and obſervation will recollect inſtances of uſeful projects, which have been ſlighted by the public becauſe the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were obſcure; and very juſt complaints of this ſore evil are to be found in the performances of very able writers. We know too that ſome eminent geniuſes have been led into the ſervice of the public by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances purely accidental; and ſo very little encouraged are good writers in compariſon with other men of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior minds that it may well ſeem to be an accident when
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:025162_0051_0FCE8C6C2AE287E8"/>any man takes upon him their unprofitable thankleſs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment. But what has hitherto been the effect of chance may by ſuitable incitements be made to proceed in future from deſign; and the danger of being deprived of the contributions of the learned be proportionately diminiſhed. The American revolution was an accident by which the neceſſity of the time drew forth into the ſervice of mankind powers which had otherwiſe remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unknown not only to the world, but to the generals and ſtateſmen who poſſeſſed them: but ſteady encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to literary exertions would reveal exalted charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as much ſuperior in number to thoſe which have been found without, as the extent of politics and war is exceeded by the ample round of ſcience. We ſhall not then ſee other Chattertons burſting their hearts with diſappointment, nor other Otways expiring with hunger in a garret while a frivolous ungrateful multitude diſſolve in idle tears becauſe Mominia weeps.</p>
            <p>As the public do in no other inſtance expect the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of a man of genius without a compenſation, ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe muſt it be concluded that in the inſtance of an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent writer they will not often be ſo cheaply obtained. But this will happen not only as a natural conſequence of diſcouragement, but as a conſequence in many caſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable and utterly beyond the control of the writer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Without a competency at leaſt it is impoſſible for a liberal man to poſſeſs that peace of mind and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent health, that integrity of the whole ſyſtem, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary

Every man is conſcious in his own caſe and a multitude of others, that the powers of the mind ſink under the preſſure of afflictive paſſions or corporal ſufferance. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility is but premature old age, and the alterations in the faculties induced by the influence of time are too well known. The aſtoniſhing intellect of Newton became ſo enfeebled in the decline of life, that he was unable ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to comprehend the myſteries of nature which in the vigour of his reaſon he had revealed: that luminary which had beamed upon the world effulgence which none but eagle's eyes could bear, loſt the mild luſtre of the ſetting ſun. Such conſequences of ruffled ſpirits or debility ſhould not ſurpriſe us, ſince when theſe cauſes act with uncommon violence madneſs itſelf enſues. We find too that the activity of the ſoul even in youth and habitual health is often materially impaired by cauſes which but ſlightly diſturb the body, ſuch as a late in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ebriety, a hearty meal, fatigue, or exhauſted paſſion.

His retirement indeed is likely from the temper of the faſhionable world to be very complete if he can enjoy or employ it. Every man who knows the value of learning muſt reſpect the learned and will feel a bluſh of indignation on his cheek when he remembers that they are often thus miſerably degraded: different men will feel for them on different accounts, as opinion and ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy may prompt; but all I hope will feel for them as fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens and ſervants of the public. Let it be kept in mind for our own ſakes that the notions of a man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by cares which perpetually interrupt his ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or even by buſineſs which he muſt attend to or ſtarve, muſt neceſſarily come forth often in an imperfect
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025162_0055_0FCE8C7456A1A3E0"/>miſshappen form; a ſorm little qualified to give them efficiency in the general cauſe. Truth demands full complete examination: upon a ſingle ſtep in an inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation may depend the ſucceſs of the whole proceſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding moral, political, or philoſophical, principles, important in the laſt degree to the precious felicity of man. In the rays of unclouded genius the minuteſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of error are diſcoverable like motes, in a ſunbeam. But a man who writes under the ſpur of the occaſion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goaded on by indigence or the dread of interruption, will ſurely communicate to his performance the diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages he feels and they will appear in defective materials, perplexed arrangement, or impure diction. To the eternal regret of literary men immaturity in the works of poets ſhew the indiſpenſible neceſſity of competence and eaſe even to the accompliſhment of their lighter labors. One of the few perfect pieces of Dryden and that by which we form the beſt eſtimate of his capacity, is the ode for St. Coecilia's day; and this was the only one, or with a few exceptions, upon which his wants allowed him to beſtow the requiſite attention. The Aeneid, one of the few eminent poetic productions of length, was the fruit of ſeven years culture under the beams of royal munificence. The enormities of the greateſt dramatic genius of the world, whether ſuffered to remain through the hurry of indigence or introduced to gratify a barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous taſte in the public, abundantly prove the propriety of placing genius, more eſpecially that which conduces moſt eſſentially to the common weal, above all vile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025162_0056_0FCE8C7606D06A50"/>A mind perpetually liable to be called off from the contemplation of its object even by things indifferent, and much more by ſuch as wring the heart, does not find it practicable to reſume at will the attention and the intuition which have been loſt. This I believe is a truth of familiar notoriety to thoſe gentlemen who in the ſena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial or forenſic character are moſt engaged in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion of abſtruſe points. Inſtances are known wherein this principle has been adopted, and purſued indeed too far, even to the ruin of the ſtudent's health and peril of his life. <hi>(h)</hi> If then peace and leiſure be ſo indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the literary man, and if it be in the power, and evidently concern the intereſts, of his country, to grant ſo ſmall a boon without which too perhaps not even the bay ſhall grace his brow, or wither there; if trifles light as air can be made at once the price of weighty benefits and the tribute of gratitude, who ſhall heſitate to do ſo profitable a duty? What thoſe benefits will be ſhall be made known in a year, a luſtrum, or an age, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may demand and muſt determine; and when thoſe benefits will end, the conſummation of all things beneath the moon alone can ſhew. The wiſdom of the <hi>Spirit of laws</hi> and ſimilar performances began to bleſs mankind when firſt they made them think of liberty; the beneficent influence grew great when America reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hold the rights of men; it grew greater ſtill when it gave the Frenchman Samſon's ſtrength to burſt his bonds. But who ſhall bound the ſphere of genius or count the ages or the myriads which ſhall feel its power?
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:025162_0057_0FCE8C77A64030C8"/>Learning is food to the mind which receives it, and like grain is good in the firſt inſtance; but when the one is imparted and the other planted in the earth, they riſe in value till their increaſe is ineſtimable. Like the Sybils leaves genius can reveal the fate of man; it can do more, it can direct it: it is the richeſt gift of the Divinity, and worthily employed will perpetually advance the human race in nearer approaches to the goodneſs and felicity of their Great Creator. Shall any man who knows their value, heſitate to raiſe to the higheſt the tranſcendent fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of mind? Shall laws be made and taxes levied that roads and rivers may be improved, and ſhall the mind alone, whence all improvements come, remain neglected? From the preſs as from a ſun are beamed thoſe rays of light which guide the erring traveller; thoſe rays of heat which rear the tender germes of reaſon and virtue in the ſoul. From the preſs as from a fountain flow ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious ſtreams which purge the ſick weal from vice and error; or poiſoned draughts to intoxicate the brain and ſink the heart, cauſing the madneſs without the joys of wine.</p>
            <p>How great thoſe labors were which unrewarded have occaſionally ennobled and felicitated the human charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter no man but moderately acquainted with literature need now be told: and of all theſe labors much the worſt are thoſe which moſt immediately lead to uſeful objects, as in the inſtances of political and philoſophical diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hiſtory, mathematics, and ſome others. How dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:025162_0058_0FCE8C7A2D0EE598"/>is his taſk who forms, examines, and corrects to his approbation the various disjointed parts of ſome great work, preparing and fitting them to unite in one admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble whole. When this has been effected, it remains for him to form theſe members into one harmonious body; this multitude of things muſt ſtand in lucid order; the rays of wiſdom's light are to be ſeparated as by a priſm and none to meet together but ſuch as are homegeneous. Much genius is neceſſary to invent; much labor to faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, divide, and connect at will the particles of a grand compages. Parvis componere magna, nothing but Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence could bid the elements to be, amidſt the boundleſs void; and powers ſecond only to Omnipotence could create a world.

Lord Shaſteſbury cenſures an author who ſhall be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by any conſideration or under any plea of neceſſity to write below his powers; and following this rule of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, pronounces every performance faulty wherein any thought is to be found which might have been placed with propriety in any other part thereof. Such doctrines fit very well the condition of a writer who, like himſelf, is a favorite of fortune; who need only to declare his wants and they are ſupplied; to whom writing is an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation which he can take up or lay down at pleaſure; who can wait the happy hour of compoſition, the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil mind, the matured judgment, the brightened fancy;

            </p>
            <p>Non homines, non dii, non conceſſere columnae: And yet this unfortunate man knows that the hopeful critic after being thus ready, as the dramatic wit expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es it, "always to aſſiſt him with his advice," would think it hard it ſhould be expected of him in return for the pleaſure and profit which, though he affects them, are enjoyed by the public, to give up the ſmalleſt portion of what he wants not, to enable a man who is in the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's ſervice to execute his buſineſs in a maſterly, effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and as far as the caſe will admit of it, in an eaſy and expeditious manner. No; much rather would ſuch a wealthy blockhead whoſe property depends upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025162_0060_0FCE8C7D62D3C580"/>of genius for its value, nay rather would many others not furniſhed with the apology of dulneſs and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, bury their treaſure in the ocean, than employ it in aſſiſting to raiſe to the dignity of independence and a level with themſelves, the beſt and brighteſt votary of ſcience. Genius only can reſpect genius as it deſerves; Folly
<q>But wonders with a fooliſh face of praiſe.</q>
Yet do we find the honors and emoluments which befit it withheld even by congenial ſpirits: and when they are beſtowed, whether by a wit or a dunce, a Frederick or a Lewis XIV. they are beſtowed not as the laurel wreath which crowns Apollo's choir, but as the wretched alms which requites the mendicant muſician. Thoſe who know how little friendſhip ſubſiſts even among profeſſed friends, and that a good horſe uſually renders his maſter more ſubſtantial ſervice than any friend he has, will not wonder that a friendleſs man of literature ſhould not meet with much ſupport from ſtrangers. How very ſmall a part of every man's income is ſpared from his pleaſures and employed for literary purpoſes, for his own improvement, or the advancement of ſuch as might be induced to delight or inſtruct mankind? Nay in new countries ſuch advantages in the improvement of eſtates are to be made by the uſe of money that few men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge themſelves even in expenſive pleaſures much as they are preferred to the comfort of learned men and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of learning: avarice in ſuch countries is as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious to ſcience as in others luxury and voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025162_0061_0FCE8C80EB806210"/>For ſuch perſons as I have ſpoken of do fine wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters exhauſt their health, ſpirits, time, and patience; and neglecting in the ſervice of their fellow-citizens the means of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>maſing treaſure, they are deſpiſed for their poverty. In many caſes too the poverty of the author is commenſurate to the difficulty and excellence of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction. We have ſeen above that Pope obtained profits from his tranſlations much ſuperior to thoſe which his beautiful original pieces could yield: and that Paradiſe Loſt did not procure its author a ſum ſufficient to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain him for a ſingle year. The care with which theſe poets prepared their beſt pieces for the preſs is well known from expunctions and interlineations in their manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts: Pope in particular did never but in one or two inſtances ſend a poem into the world which had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a very long time in his hands. The Georgicks upon which Virgil meant to build his fame is known, ſhort as it is, to have been the fruit of ſeven years labor. Yet how much more dignity is there in a ſmall conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> work than in folios which an ordinary man can ſcribble? As much more as in the famous ſtatue of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander compared with a clumſy Coloſſus. Yet does even voluminous dulneſs in the preſent ſtate of literature, often enrich the author more than the moſt uſeful or delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful leſſer work.</p>
            <p>LITTLE need the pains of penury to be added to the numerous evils which beſet the learned. Great without doubt in many inſtances are the delights of literature
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:025162_0062_0FCE8C81D7614E48"/>when they are found, where only they need be fought, in peaceful plenty: yet are there pains as well as pleaſures peculiar to genius, which often break its reſt ſo much that the reader of a noble performance is often much more to be envied than the author. Men of diſtinguiſhed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties are uſually agitated by more eager ardent paſſions than ordinary men, and "keen edged ſwords will cut their ſcabbards." Thoſe who have moſt wants will ſurely in this world of grief feel moſt the pangs of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Beſides, the very exerciſe of fine talents will often weary them and diſorder the body in which they act: to thoſe who embrace literature as an amuſement it is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver of health as a check to the miſchiefs of debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery; but intemperate ſtudy brought on by the ardor of purſuit impairs the conſtitution; and there is always danger leſt the fire of genius ſhould conſume in its own blaze. Even from the reſtleſs temperament of a vigorous mind conſtantly ſolicited by multiplying objects may a diſpoſition to the profeſſion of literature be in itſelf a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity: and if, where the powers exiſt the diſpoſition to learned labors is not alſo preſent, and nothing but a ſenſe of duty urges upon a ſea of troubles, the predicament becomes ſtill more pitiable. How great too is the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of a writer who dreads to miſs his end yet feels at every ſtep the peril of deviation. Hear the language of a man who was at once philoſopher, poet, wit, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic yet was never ſafe from error:

So true is it that men are not content with ſtarving genius but ſtrive firſt to degrade and drive it to deſpair: and though both theſe propenſities diſplay in odious colors ſelfiſhneſs, ingratitude or dullneſs wherever they appear, yet has the world ſeldom afforded an inſtance wherein one or both of them might not commonly be obſerved. Can any thing be better fitted to wound the feelings and depreſs the ardor of a real genius than the frivolous,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:025162_0064_0FCE8C861A32C980"/>affected, and malevolent, remarks of ſuch a writer as Warburton? a faſtidious critic without taſte; a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as inſufferable as a proud man without integrity. The want of judgment in particular departments of literature which is obſervable in ſome men of fine talents and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect candor acts as another check to literary attempts; and the erroneous cenſures of ſuch men miſguide the multitude and mar the writer's hopes more effectually than the moſt ſtudied devices of dulneſs or malevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The mind of Locke, exalted as it was, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs not above the admiration of the poems of Blackmore, and might therefore not improbably have been without the diſcriminating ſenſe of Pope's or Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's beauties. On the other part, men of the brighteſt fancies are ſometimes unpoſſeſſed of that portion of the faculty of judgment which qualifies to decide upon the merits of a philoſophic diſſertation. Dr. Johnſon, though in many inſtances a diſcerning critic, ſays of certain paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torals, "it is ſufficient blame to mention that they are paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torals," yet would thoſe of Virgil, though he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten nothing elſe, have brought down his name with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to our time; and Pope's, though he has borrowed freely from the other, would have convinced us he was capable of the graces of the <hi>Rape of the Lock,</hi> though he had never written it. But men of the beſt taſte and genius do not always judge accurately even in their own departments, as they do not deny. A good critic in flowing ſpirits may eaſily diſregard the tender meltings of an elegy; and another overwhelmed with grief is
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:025162_0065_0FCE8C890E8B53E0"/>blind to all the charms of wit. Men of melancholy or ſaturnine conſtitutions ſhould be careful how they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce upon the quality of a gay production, unleſs feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity or ſome other occaſional cauſe ſhall have made a temporary alteration in their characters; otherwiſe they will want the entertainment which ſuch pieces are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to afford, and the ill-fated author may have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to rue their unſeaſonable gravity. Falſtaff ſays of Prince John, "Good faith, this ſame young ſober-blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boy doth not love me: nor a man cannot make him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine." If from various cauſes genius err thus in its decrees, what ſhall be expected from folly? and how intolerable muſt it be to a fine writer to ſee blockheads prefered to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or, if he be a generous man, to behold the neglect of great talents in another. All theſe intended wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the critic ſcourge whether inflicted by virtue or vice, ſenſe or nonſenſe, are felt too at a time when it is become extremely difficult to employ with ſucceſs after ſo many others, old modes of writing, or, after ſo many others, to invent new.</p>
            <p>BUT though the labors of accompliſhed writing are very great and the ſucceſs extremely uncertain, yet let us ſuppoſe what will never happen, that literature ſhall be faſhionable without being made reſpectable, ſecondly that the public ſhall be content to feed to ſatiety every eminent writer with the only food he can ever obtain from them in their individual capacity, I mean with
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:025162_0066_0FCE8C8A25499BC8"/>praiſe. As a diſtinguiſhed wit has ſaid of ſome of the critics above ſpoken of,
<q>
                  <l>"Rules for good writing they with care indite</l>
                  <l>And ſhew us what is bad by what they write."</l>
               </q>
So a very fine poet has given this precept—
<q>
                  <l>"Let ſuch teach others who themſelves excel,</l>
                  <l>And cenſure freely who have written well."</l>
               </q>
It is eaſy for a good writer to adopt this rule in his prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices to other men as directed; but there are alſo thoſe whoſe candor and accuracy of taſte are ſuch that they do not heſitate to adopt ſpontaneouſly ſuch rigid diſcipline in the correction of their own performances: wanting other cenſure the fineſt writers, being themſelves moſt ſenſible of the difficulty of their taſk, have often riſen above the little weakneſſes of vanity and paſſed, like Brutus, a rigid ſentence upon their offspring; ever find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them below ſome fancied model of perfection. Good writers like good moraliſts, are ever more indulgent to the errors of others than their own. Pope ſpeaking of ſome of the ancients, ſays,
<q>
                  <l>"The gen'rous critic fann'd the poet's fire</l>
                  <l>And taught the world with reaſon to admire."</l>
               </q>
And can we ever ſufficiently applaud the ſublime friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Virgil which could with-hold him from becoming the rival of Horace in the province of lyric poetry, or the unequalled candor and exquiſite refinement of taſte which could lead him to diſcover in a poem of his own, one of the moſt noble and perfect in the world, faults which could induce a reſolution to conſign it to that
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:025162_0067_0FCE8C8CA8155A40"/>oblivion which ſeventeen ages which have ſucceeded and all which ſhall ſucceed thoſe, would not perpetually have regretted only becauſe they would have been inſenſible of the value of the treaſure which had been loſt. Nay ſuch is the perverſe fate of fine writers that they have not only the taſk of producing a work which ſhall be deemed admirable as a whole, but they are often driven to the hazardous neceſſity of weakening particular parts to give additional force and effect to the reſt, as muſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians introduce forced modulations and diſcords to raiſe the character of the melody and harmony which are to ſucceed. To this practice perhaps may be referred many inequalities in <hi>Paradiſe Loſt;</hi> and perhaps Homer was unjuſtly cenſured when it was ſaid of him,
<q>Indignor quando<expan>
                     <am>

Pope perhaps was of this opinion when he ſaid
<q>It is not Homer nods but we that dream.</q>

            <p>LET us now proceed to take notice of ſome further reaſons why a ſuitable encouragement only can render completely efficient to the public ſervice the talents of the citizens even when they ſhall have been cultured in thoſe numerous ſeminaries of learning which have with ſo much propriety been eſtabliſhed throughout this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and daily are increaſing; and to obſerve that it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters little to the community how much any man may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel his fellows in wiſdom and learning while he wants opportunity, or, which in many caſes is the ſame thing, encouragement, to make them known.

Here then is a luminary hidden in a cloud; and who ſhall bring forth its ſplendors? Great talents are not within the ſphere of common comprehenſion; and patronage in ſuch a caſe would probably be indiſpenſible; (in a free country ought this to be ſo?) That in this ſtate of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment a genius ſhould be diſcovered, is at leaſt a matter of uncertainty. But though he be diſcovered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended many new obſtacles may riſe up to impede the advancement of the higheſt merit; the diſtance of the object; the reſerve of his character ſo natural to thoſe who have been bred in retirement; the abſence of colloquial advantages, or others of a more ſuperficial kind ſo ſeldom to be found in ſecluded ſtudents who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the graces in their devotion to the muſes; nay even the noble pride of honor which ſcorns a baſe ſubmiſſion, even this which ought to raiſe his powers to their lofty ſphere, ſhall ſink him down perhaps to dark oblivion,

But it may alſo happen that a very valuable man in the ſituation above mentioned may be of a character merely ſpeculative and without any portion of that alacrity of ſpirit which with his other qualifications would fit him to ſerve his country in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic capacity.

Hogarth, the ingenius mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral painter, was ſo deficient in the faculty of memory that he was unable to retain thereby an ordinary ſonnet; and Magliabechi, a man of ordinary intellects could read a book throughout and recite the contents.

Such are the evil conſequences of evil governments, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of flagitious rulers. In a ſtate where every power of the mind and body, every doctrine, every eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment, every hope and every fear, are employed to miſlead and degrade the people a hero's firmneſs muſt uphold a man in the dignity of human nature; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an eſtabliſhment wherein freedom, education, litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and eloquence, concur to ſtrengthen and ſupport, he muſt indeed be meaner than the meaneſt ſlave who gives his mind to weakneſs and his heart to ſin. Happy Americans who while all other nations through the vaſt expanſe of nature bow down in ſorrow to a tyrant or brave his uplifted ſword to break his rod, have gained al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready bleſſings above all price, and may ſtill hope for others through every ſtage of time, wiſdom, and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. If when auſpicious ages fun their round, your liberty, your felicity, muſt be no more, our eyes reach not the diſtant dreary proſpect, or are dazzled by the blaze of intervening glories. But the advantages in poſſeſſion, or in expectation, can be ſecured ſo well by nothing as
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025162_0075_0FCE8C9A26AB6DE8"/>by the aids of literature. The progreſs of America in arts may be made rapid even to our wiſhes.

England has already borrowed a political writer from this country, whoſe advice if prudently adopted will cover her with bleſſings which ſhe never yet has known.</p>
            <p>THE full licenſe which the form of our government allows for inveſtigation is at preſent the only incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to literary induſtry; but were ſuitable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuper-added thereto an extreme eagerneſs peculiar to a good cauſe and very favorable to its ſucceſs, would quickly animate the powers of the learned; and the emoluments they might receive from any inſtitutions in their favor would be repaid an hundred fold by their ſervices. The condition in which America does now, and for ſometime to come, will ſtand, both as a tree, and a new, country, demands in a very particular manner the united efforts of all vigorous minds whereby ſhe may be enabled to apply, improve, and obtain, advantages: and, whether through the form of the government, or the genius of the people, a diſpoſition to uſeful ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is more frequent here than any other literary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſity, and might be rendered infinitely beneficial. In all the ſtates of Europe, France excepted, few men can
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025162_0076_0FCE8C9B67BCBAC0"/>enjoy the luxury of writing a diſquiſition with any hope of its being acted upon; a wiſe and virtuous man at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to do good in a bad government rolls the ſtone of Siſyphus, or labors like Enceladus with a mountain on his breaſt. The maſculine, original, and candid manner of thinking, in matters which regard the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of human kind, and which the new and intereſting ſtate of things in America has generated, is almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known in old eſtabliſhments long accuſtomed and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to abuſes. In ſuch ſituations the mind is circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed and it is as much impoſſible to range at large the paths of truth as to travel in the walls of a priſon. It is no wonder then that under theſe circumſtances litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has uſually been confined to ſubjects of mere theory or curioſity, to the neglect of the moſt uſeful practical ſpeculations. In America we do not amuſe ourſelves with ſtriving to prove what we all know very well with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, the exiſtence of matter or time, or diſputing about what it is of no conſequence to determine, whether matter be infinitely deviſible, or whether a ſimple unit in matter occupies no ſpace at all. It is of much greater importance to us to know and upon all occaſions to bear in mind ſuch things as theſe (which ſeem but very lately to have attracted the notice of European nations) that man is compoſed of certain parts, be they what they may whether either of them be admitted to be material or not, one of which cannot be lacerated by the bayonet or the rack of a tyrant without ſuffering much pain; that the other part which is called ſpirit or mind, cannot be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted

So much has the human mind been hitherto deprived by tyrants of exerciſe and food that its bulk and ſtrength are probably yet but infantine. If France and England have done ſo much under the controling hand of oppreſſion, what may not be expected from the powers of intellect acting as they do in America without check or hindrance, if to the moſt perfect freedom and a ſenſe of duty be added the motives which ſpring from intereſt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience? Even in England, the eaſieſt of enſlaved ſtates, diſcuſſion is declared to be miſchievous; and thoſe who ſtarve while they labor to pamper their oppreſſors un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an old eſtabliſhment, are taught to believe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novation is an evil.

If the ſervice and inſtruction of a free nation were worthily requited, the improvement would be without example. Common ſenſe, the faculty by which truth is diſtinctly diſcerned through the veil of which cuſtom, prejudice, laws, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, or lawleſs power, had drawn over it, has at length regained a portion of long loſt dominion over the minds of men.

When uſeful writers are drawn out in ſucceſſion each in his turn gives double power to him who goes before, and him who follows after; and they form together an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable, reſiſtleſs, phalanx to brave the aſſault of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence, ambition and wickedneſs, and to bear down the firmeſt champions of prejudice and error. Minds which may be eaſily diſpoſed to ſuch objects as are moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately conducive to the great end of human felicity, are perhaps, as has been hinted above, more frequent in America than in all Europe taken together before the French revolution. How delightful is it to contemplate in the character of Dr. Franklin, that ſimple and ſublime wiſdom and benevolence which could deſcend to the humble employment of preparing rules for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation of ſuch of his fellow-creatures as might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the inconveniences of a tedious voyage; or on ſhore might be diſpoſed to amuſe themſelves with a pack of cards; and afterwards could riſe to the momentous buſineſs of founding a mighty empire, or diſarming the lightning of its terrors! The reſtleſs gloom of an idle Engliſhman, and the ennui which the moſt animated na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world could once feel in its low eſtate, may be utterly extermined from a ſcene wherein objects per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually preſent themſelves which intereſt the mind through the medium of delightful paſſions, admiration,

Even now, frivolity is ſcarcely known, except in the characters of a few giddy boys whoſe birth ſets them above labor, and whoſe talents do not raiſe them to any reſpectable occupation; who are too young or too ignorant to be right, and too old to be whipt for being wrong. When diſſipation ſhall have become more faſhionable than at preſent throughout theſe ſtates encouragement will become more indiſpenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to literary efforts and they will be leſs efficient: in the interim it would check diſſipation in its progreſs.

The object of legiſlation ſhould be to promote among the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens a ſpecies of happineſs worthy of the dignity of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature; which can be done by no other means than the union of virtue and wiſdom. Where ſucceſs is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, as in free ſtates, ought any thing to be left unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted? How far the very form of a government may operate in amending the character of man, we ſee already in a variety of inſtances among ourſelves. In the ſhort ſpace of twenty years many prejudices and errors, ſome of them of the moſt pernicious nature, which have been rooted in the mind perhaps ever ſince the creation of the world, have been totally extirpated. The enlightened and liberal principles which originated from the political advantages of theſe ſtates when colonies, generated the American revolution; this revolution firſt taught her citizens, next the citizens of France, and ſoon perhaps will teach all the nations of Europe, that thoſe wars with which the ferocious ambition of monarchs has ſo long diſturbed the earth are wicked and murderous; that as they have had no object ſo far as concerned the people but a change of tyrants, any man employed in them was a ſlave and ruffian, though the favorite of an empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and the leader of millions.

In a bad government even the diverſions of the citizens partake of its character. The Romans amuſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the combats of gladiators; the Spaniards with bull-fights; and it is not ſurpriſing that thoſe men can take delight in the ſpectacle of a wretched animal muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated and cut up a live, or two fellow-creatures compelled to mangle each other for their ſport, who can build their impious glory upon the maſſacre of a nation. As falſe moralty enjoins or permits many things which are abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, ſo alſo does it prohibit many things which are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent: the conſequence of which is, that men make themſelves amends with guilty pleaſures. This we well know to be done even in caſes where the morality pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed is believed to be true: many characters whom decorum throws under uneaſy reſtraints with reſpect to particular enjoyments, as thoſe of wine and women, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge to an unuſual exceſs in thoſe which have been
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025162_0086_0FCE8CAD630B5BF8"/>termed the graver vices; pride, envy, calumny, gluttony, and avarice; this principle in human nature was known to Mahomet; ſo that when he refuſed wine to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples he made them rich amends in the Haram. True religion will alſo proſper moſt by the exciſion of unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary forms: the more religion is ſimplified the more will it be reſpected. Man is not naturally ungrateful to his Creator, as appears by the numberleſs religious inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions which have been ſo readily adopted: but tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical eſtabliſhments, perſecutions, bigotry, and folly, have too often diſguiſed the holy form of piety and concealed her charms.</p>
            <p>TRUE wiſdom and learning, religion and morality with pure liberty ſuperadded, it is evident, muſt elevate the ſoul to the higheſt ſphere in which it is capable of acting, and render human life an exalted condition. In tyrannic ſtates the purſuits of the citizens when inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, are illy calculated to enoble the character: the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the poor is gain, the buſineſs of the rich is plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; a new bargain or ſcheme of profit employs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the former; a new play or opera, player, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or dancer, occupies the attention of the latter: to both is the buſineſs of the ſtate a matter of equal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference; they feel they have little intereſt therein; if it proſper they are ſlaves; if it do not, they can be little worſe. Even in England, the beſt of bad governments, the power of the monarch almoſt extinguiſhes the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the other branches of the legiſlature; neither
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:025162_0087_0FCE8CB06AF36838"/>lords nor commons maintain the manly pride which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the hereditary and delegated rulers of a great peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; they degrade themſelves, and the nation partakes of their diſgrace; all are overlooked in the immenſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance between the firſt magiſtrate and any other perſon in the realm; and all theſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e arrogantly ſtyles <hi>his</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, rather than the ſubjects or citizens of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Hence the condition of an Engliſhman is in a political view unintereſting, or only rendered otherwiſe by his approximation to a revolution. <hi>(l)</hi> In America, on the contrary, that pride of heart which has ſo long militated againſt the rights of man, aſſumes a new, a virtuous, and a dignified character: eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man feels that he forms a portion of the majeſty of the people.

Such principles prevail in private citizens; and in public the deſire of obtaining the approbation of thoſe who are to be ſerved, together with a ſenſe of duty, often advance the character to the moſt exalted pitch. The glare, the tinſel, the gewgaws, the noiſy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geantry of government, are ſlighted by the ſervants of a pure republic; and they are ſolicitous not about a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacle or a ſound, but an added bleſſing, or a curſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. In the revolution war, while the leaders of the Britiſh army were panting for the glories of victory, the generals of America provided more carefully for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of retreat; while the firſt were ſtruggling to keep the field, the laſt were only anxious to keep the country; while the one party amuſed themſelves with erecting trophies, the other were buſied in eſtabiſhing an empire. While in bad governments the blackeſt crimes againſt the ſtate, the ſhock of which will be felt by mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions living and hundreds of millions unborn, are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, ſpoken of familiarly as trifles, and even encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged and rewarded by a royal traitor; under ſuch eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments as ours inevitable infamy or deſtruction are ſure to overtake ſuch reprobates. The conduct of the officers of different governments being ſo entirely oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025162_0089_0FCE8CB35464E6C8"/>it is not to be wondered at if in the bad a veil is thrown upon their unhallowed deeds, and in the good all national concerns even court the public eye. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly while in England every poſſible reſtraint is thrown upon the freedom of the preſs, in America not only is that freedom impracticable to all aſſaults, but the rulers of the people even aſſiſt in providing the moſt eaſy and convenient conveyance for the chronicles of their tranſactions,<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Newspaper Law.</note>

Men are thus daily reminded of the ineſtimable quality of the bleſſing they enjoy, and taught to feel deeply what was ſaid of the Romans; that, if they ſhould ſink to ſlavery, their new condition would be wretched in proportion to the felicity of the former. Cicero remarks, that "the recollection of ſlavery will improve the charms of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;" how much more would the image of departed freedom heighten the deformity of ſlavery? The ſame writer ſays again, "it is better not to live at all than to live under the loſs of advantages once poſſeſſed;" but what advantage can leave behind it ſuch inconſolable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret as extinguiſhed liberty? Shall any man who loves virtue, who loves his country, who loves the human ſpecies, heſitate by all the aids of genius to render "im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable, eternal, fixed as the firmament of heaven,"
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025162_0090_0FCE8CB5A1CC63B8"/>bleſſings which have been reſerved from the creation of the world to be laviſhed upon this favored latter age? Let it be remembered too that the precious depoſit in our hands will not eaſily retain, if it do not increaſe, its worth.

In the execution of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which was committed to his charge he diſplayed the firmneſs of a hero, the prudence of a general, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of a patriot, and the honor of a gentleman. His virtue was not the phrenzy of Ariſtides or Brutus building their country's greatneſs upon the ſpoil of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; it was the virtue of reaſon combating for the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed not becauſe they were fellow-citizens, but becauſe they were fellow-men; founding, but not ſubverting, a mighty empire; not to inſult, but to redreſs; not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave, but free the world. He obtained the confidence of his country during her ſtruggle for happineſs without the ſmalleſt mixture of ſuſpicion. He was not only in every department of his office unblamed, but cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with applauſe and glory; the homage of the people was love, veneration, gratitude; and they diſcovered
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:025162_0105_0FCE8CCE5589EE68"/>their ſenſibility in the preſence of this father of his country, not only in looks and words, but in tears. Jealouſy, envy, and calumny, if they wiſhed to ſtrike, dared not to aim the blow in the preſence of an American citizen. Nor among American citizens only was his name inviolate; amidſt the rancour of civil broils, the moſt injurious, ignoble, and murderous ſlave, ſtill ſpared his virtues; and thoſe who ſought his life denied that he deſerved to die. Theſe were his honors in the field; and in the cabinet he ruled with undiminiſhed purity the empire he had eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>GEORGE the Third, of England, never having, either in his own perſon or in that of any progenitor, been appointed to the diadem, ſtands of courſe upon the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an uſurper.

Like Auguſtus he was a deſpot, but knew not the refinements which could ſooth the rage of injured vaſſals. His occupations like Nero's when they were not wicked were frivolous. But even Nero at an early ſeaſon put forth the buds of virtue which periſhed by the peſtilent breath of flattery: George on the contrary ruſhed with ſudden eagerneſs into the corruption, the black atrocity of policy: he did not indeed like Nero diſappoint the hopes of his ſubjects

The immenſe treaſures laviſh'd upon him by the empoveriſhed ſtate, he employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not even in the ſumptuous elegancies of royalty, but in corrupting the ſervants of the nation which paid the revenue. The offices of government he baſely put to ſale, receiving in payment the liberties of his ſubjects. He plunged the kingdom into a debt of an hundred millions for the loſs of thirteen flouriſhing colonies. This enormous debt, contracted by a war which involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Britiſh nation in difficulties and diſgraces which never may have end, was accumulated on a former ſtill greater; but the firſt had been incur'd by his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor in a war which had exalted Britain to greater heights of glory than ſhe had ever reached before. He mingled together crimes and errors groſs and mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous; he heaped Oſſa upon Pelion and Olympus upon Oſſa. Yet the armies employed in this ferocious war fought with a valor worthy of a better cauſe and better king: but the maxims of policy and diſhonor which iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued from the court infected theſe gallant troops; their rapine, treachery, and cruelty, created enemies faſter than they could ſubdue them, and their laſt adverſaries were more formidable than the firſt; they became in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible by deſpair.

               <p>IT is aftoniſhing and ſhocking to hear even in America the mild deſpotiſm, as it is ſometimes called, of the old French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpoken of with commendation or indulgence: and, ſince we know the chain of tyranny which ſubſiſts in ſuch a ſtate, and the influence of power in corrupting the heart, it is a ſoleciſm to call any deſpotiſm mild. The people of France it is ſaid have always been gayer and therefore happier than their freer neighbours, it is therefore contended that the form of their government was ſufficient for their purpoſes. Let it be remembered however that tranquility, not gayety, is the teſt of happineſs. Tranquility is the habit of a contented mind; it is the repoſe of the ſoul; gayety is an occaſional guſt of paſſion diſtinct from and often encouraged, as the ſubſtitute of happineſs. This tranquility, or this gayety, I conceive, is not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have been known in thoſe dungeons whence multitudes who had ſurvived their griefs were reſcued by the reformed government be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reft of their ſenſes by deſpair. We know that the miſeries of thoſe wretches who were deſtined to be the ſport of a graduated ſyſtem of oppreſſion were great enough to appal the imagination of a diſtant ſtranger; how much then muſt thoſe have trembled who could hear the groans of an ill-ſtar'd fellow creature and fellow ſubject, and knew not but their hour of anguiſh was at hand? Too well they ſaw, and terrible inſtances have tranſpired ſince the revolution, that even the neareſt relatives have not always ſpared each other.

<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025162_0109_0FCE8CD5DA5DE890"/>yet can it not be doubted that the portion of happineſs would have increaſed by the extinction of theſe cauſes of diſquiet, and a a freeman diſcontented with every reaſon to be happy, would ſurely be more diſcontented with none at all. Providence has evidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that no human being ſhould taſte happineſs or miſery in the extreme through the courſe of his exiſtence. Under no concurrence or combination of circumſtances, numerous as the human race has been; and with the chance of good fortune though expoſed to the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of bad, has any one inſtance of a happy man appeared upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord; the purpoſe of which perhaps has been to reconcile the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate to their fate, no man being exempt from trouble; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the proſperous from ſinking into a ſelfiſh ſtate of voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and being unmindful of thoſe duties which may procure their paſſport into ſome ſtate of perfect felicity; and though, for the purpoſe laſt mentioned, the diſtreſſes of the human race uſually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponderate; yet does the mercy of heaven appear in all inſtances however calamitous, and often in the midſt of ſevereſt trials.

               <p>THE boroughs upon this occaſion were repreſented in what was called a convention of the people, principally by the preſbyterians; and Walpole's execrable ſyſtem of liberty not having been at that time introduced, this body of men acted with a becoming diſregard to the claim founded on hereditary rights; yet does the reform in the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation ſeem never to have come under their contemplation as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient

One thing is clear; that the acts of the body of men then aſſembled to tranſact the national buſineſs were not the acts of a convention of the people; firſt, becauſe the repreſentation of the commons was very unequal; and ſecondly, becauſe the lords maintained as uſual their parliamentary authority; nor were theſe acts the acts of parliament, becauſe no king ſat upon the throne; no rational doubt then can remain whether the acts were illegal.</p>

               <p>SINCE this tract was ſketched out, the following paſſage from the notes to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Mr. Hayley's fourth epiſtle upon epic poetry, has come under the obſervation of the writer. "It has lately been lamented by an elegant and accompliſhed writer who had too much reaſon for the complaint, that <hi>the profeſſion of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by far the moſt laborious of any, leads to no real benefit.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience undoubtedly proves that it has a general tendency to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſh its votaries; and the legiſlators would act perhaps a wiſe, at all events an honorable part, if they corrected this tendency, by eſtabliſhing public emoluments for ſuch as eminently diſtinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the various branches of ſcience. It is ſurely poſſible to form ſuch an eſtabliſhment which, without proving a national bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, might aggrandize the literary glory of the nation by preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her men of letters from the evil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>PUBLIC rewards only can in any country raiſe literature to the eminence of which it is capable; but the preſs itſelf might in
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:025162_0111_0FCE8CD99665A868"/>ſome eaſes be rendered the mean of advantages not at preſent in poſſeſſion. It has been obſerved above that as literary property is now circumſtanced a writer who publiſhed at home may be rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of a portion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> profits by a foreign bookſeller who ſhall reprint, or by a domeſtic one if he ſhould publiſh abroad. There ſeems indeed no good reaſon why a man may not print a book for his own benefit in ſeveral countries at the ſame time and in each retain the copy right. But it might often happen that the author or the printer to whom the copy ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>old, would find it inconvenient to print a book in a diſtant country as well as his own: wherefore an agreement between two ſtates who ſpeak the ſame language to prohibit the practice of re-printing from each other ſuch books as may be publiſhed in future, would operate as a ſuperior encouragement. A propoſal for ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement would probably be acceptable to Great-Britain; for the number of books annually publiſhed in that country does now very far exceed thoſe publiſhed in the ſame time in the United States; and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Something indeed might be loſt to America in the printing line if re-printed books are ſold cheaper than thoſe imported; but the Engliſh books already in circulation afford ample materials for this buſineſs; nor ſhould a narrow piece of political economy be ſuffered to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſede the great concerns of literature: the direct application of written wiſdom to political purpoſes will quickly overbalance any trifling diſadvantages induced. How far too the extenſion of the term of copy right may be beneficial is worthy of conſideration: and in all regulations or eſtabliſhments for the propagation of learning it ſeems to be adviſable that every new attainment <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It would have been intereſting and curious to obſerve, what fine ſpeculative ſenſe, keen ſarcaſm, tory rancour, bigotry, ſpiritual pride, and matchleſs effrontry could do againſt intuitive wiſdom, the rage of oratory, the integrity of a patriot, and the dignity of a gentleman. A greater inſtance of the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of faſhion cannot be produced than the boundleſs reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Dr. Johnſon. It appears evidently, even from the partial records of his particular friend, that he had the prejudices of a clown, the ſuperſtition of a goſſip, the weakneſs of an infant, the arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of a tyrant, and the manners of a ſavage; yet has he been placed foremoſt in the tribes of Engliſh ſaints and philoſophers. He was diſcovered to be an eminent poet too, becauſe he imitated two ſatires of Juvenal, and wrote a tragedy which is neither acted nor read, and which in the latter of his life, when his taſte had got the better of his vanity, he himſelf deſpiſed. Anacreon's dove has indeed all the force and elegance of an original, and, had it been ſuch, would have done him more honor than all his other poems. The encomiums laviſhed upon his imitations, tranſlations, and famous prologue, ſhew how little elſe has been found in his verſes worthy of admiration: and the compoſitions of Pope in theſe kinds added to the merit of his greater pieces place him in ſuch a ſtate of exaltation, that it is not to be conceived how any man, who ſtands ſo far beneath him as Johnſon, can be a poet.

               <p>WE have ſpoken above of the diverſity of talents, and among other inſtances, of the diſparity which appears in the faculty of memory. Though memory ſtanding alone obtains but little reſpect, yet when united with nobler faculties it riſes in value exceedingly. It does lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of itſelf which we can admire, but enables the judgment, wit, or fancy, to effect wonders. Memory by recovering at will loſt notions of our own or others, or facts, forms combinations, elicits truth, and creates poetry, eloquence, wit, or humour. By this faculty, as the hand-maid to others, was Dr. Johnſon empowered with ſo much facility on a ſudden to diſcuſs a variety of points in writing or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. To the advantages obtained by memory in advancing life may ſometimes be aſcribed the great ſuperiority in many caſes obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in the proportionate powers of the boy and man. However, the power of effecting a purpoſe ſo far as it comes from memory is not genius; learning is not genius though moſt ſkilfully employed thereby.</p>
               <p>Remarkable inſtances of nice diſcrimination in genius appear in the characteriſtic walk. Very diſtinct talents are exerted in the delinea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of characters in a drama, an epiſtolary, and a narrative, work. How admirable, yet how different are the powers diſcovered by Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare, Richardſon, and Fielding? Yet their object was the ſame,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:025162_0116_0FCE8CE1D8036660"/>though perhaps neither could have attained it by the means adopted by the reſt. Shakeſpeare though ſo well able in words to repreſent the whole race of men exactly as they are, found it impoſſible to perſonate them upon the ſtage. He who acquitted himſelf to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment of the world in the lofty ſphere of dramatic writing, could yet fall ſhort of excellence in the analagous, and humbler capacity, of a player. It is intereſting to enquire what might be the effect of propagating the ſpecies through a long ſeries of generations by the union of tranſcendent and congenial minds: the improvements made by culture in the ſtrain of horſes might warrant the experiment. Strength and ſwiftneſs are the faculties moſt eſteemed in horſes; in men, the intellectual powers: why then might not the conſequent melioration in either caſe be proportionate? why might not a being ultimately be produced as far ſuperior to the firſt of human creatures, as the firſt courſer now at New-Market to the beſt known in Europe before the introduction of the breed of Arabia? Who can ſay that man is not capable of riſing as far above Newton, Locke and Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, as they ſtand above ordinary characters? As we find in the preſent ſtate of things that ſome men can on a ſudden accompliſh more in the exerciſes of the mind than others with the moſt laborious ſtudy, why might not a brood of genius be obtained which ſhould ſurpaſs as much every fortuitous production? Philoſophers and mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians who when called upon ſhould on the inſtant vie with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches of Locke, or the ſchemes of Newton? Orators who ſhould aſſume the vigor of Demoſthenes and the grace of Tully? Poets like the bard of Paradiſe,
<q>Utt'ring ſuch dulcet and harmonious breath,</q>
As the heaven-ſprung council of Pandemonium?</p>

               <p>ALTHOUGH the buſineſs of congreſs will draw forth many ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed orators yet much interruption of buſineſs is already occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the number of ſpeakers, and there will be more when the number ſhall increaſe.

There is much wiſdom in this inſtitution: for a man may ſpeak much better than another who ſhall decide more judiciouſly. This is the beſt mode of bringing into operation all the wiſdom and eloquence of an aſſembly; and all the honeſty and candor too; for a man will determine more impartially upon a queſtion which he has neither ſupported nor oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in debate.

               <p>SO much is the bulk of the Engliſh nation under the influence of ſilly prejudices with regard to the form of their government, that they were extremely enraged with the Americans becauſe they too would not adopt erroneous principles. Having been long accuſtomed to be taxed and oppreſſed by a parliament in which the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the fourteen hundredth part of the citizens had the greateſt number of votes, and to be amuſed with the notion of a virtual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation ſaid to be enjoyed by the reſt, they wiſhed to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate this doctrine in the colonies. Theſe however had been long bleſſed in the advantages of a real and ſubſtantial repreſentation and diſregarded the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>gared fallacy. It is ſtrange indeed, that a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſhould in either caſe be termed virtual which in England had at beſt only virtue enough to cruſh the people equally in every claſs, and in America not ſo much as this, becauſe the modes of taxation would neceſſarily have been diſcriminated by local circumſtances, and the parliament were to have determined where and how heavily the weight ſhould fall. The haughtineſs which has prevailed in England with reſpect to ſurrounding nations is well known and has ariſen from the ſuperiority of their government (bad as it is) over all thoſe which heretofore exiſted among them, and from their conſequent opulence and naval vigor. It is not therefore to be wondered at that America, in her colonial ſtate, ſhould have been conſidered merely as an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendage; as a tail to a mighty comet; and that ſhe ſhould have been deemed by every drunken boor, or booriſh ſquire, no more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty which belonged to England.

Both in England and America this inſidious virtual repreſentation could do no otherwiſe than throw the whole direction of a profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate parliament into the hands of an atrocious monarch. The truth is that the citizens of that country poſſeſs no powers of legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the whole of their vaunted freedom reſides in their judicial ſyſtem; how long that citadel ſhall be maintained it muſt be left to thoſe to determine who are ſo deeply, ſo awfully concerned: and they will do well to enquire whether lord chief juſtice Mansfield not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his highly extolled judicial integrity, did not decide in favor of the king, in all cauſes between him and his ſubjects, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequiouſly as the deteſted Jefferies in the reign of the Stuarts, who had the infamous effrontry to boaſt that he was the firſt judge who had ever been able to put the life of an innocent Engliſhman into the hands of his prince. Slavery can beſt make her approaches under the maſk of liberty: This knew Julius Caeſar when he refuſed the proffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed crown; and Auguſtus when he ſtood for the conſulſhip. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh have juſt liberty enough at preſent to conſole and reſtrain them from outrage under the leſs of the reſt; other nations of Europe having enjoyed none, ſeem at length reſolved to obtain it complete; and the Engliſh without a revolution, will poſſibly be leſs free than any. It is notorious that the Britiſh king, like queen Ann, encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages thoſe doctrines by the diſgrace of which he reached the throne;
<pb n="118"
                      facs="unknown:025162_0119_0FCE8CE6801218D0"
                      rendition="simple:additions"/>and that the nation has no means of redreſs but a revolution, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the people for the purpoſe of equaliſing the repreſentation, a reform which would itſelf be a revolution incomparably the beſt that kingdom ever knew. Many <hi>independent</hi> enlightened Engliſhmen (and no other, ſuch is the dreadful influence of the crown) believe theſe things; and the wiſdom and virtue of the people, even in the inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wherein they are found united, will form a formidable power whenever they ſhall be brought into full operation; great ſpirits ſtill abound among them; and great indeed are thoſe which reſiſt the raging peſtilence of royalty.</p>

Among the ancients great literacy excellence raiſed the character much higher than in modern times; this perhaps aroſe out of the paucity of books, and the rarity of men of learning: men are prone to admire what is far beyond their ſphere, and what is ſeldom to be ſeen; ſmatterers on the contrary are uſually vain, preſumptuous and arrogant.
