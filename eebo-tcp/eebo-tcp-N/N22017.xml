            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <p>By my ſoul it's true, for I'd rout every flock of ſheep in the adjoining common; and, with my ſword drawn, I'd quarrel and fight with the firſt wind-mill that chanced to place itſelf in my way.</p>

                     <p>Sheep and wind-mills, Mr. Frolic! (<hi>paſſion</hi>) you mean this as an inſult upon my judgment! I that have received daily lectures from the learned Miſs Martin, who is the delight of Mal-pomene, Polly Hymnia, Call-ye-up, and the diſtreſſing muſe of tragedy, Thalia!</p>

                        <stage>Pauſing</stage> O! O! I ſuppoſe you mean Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liope, the muſe of eloquence; upon my ſoul I don't wonder at the brilliancy of your expreſſions, now I find you are under her influence; but I'm afraid, my dear Dolly, nature never formed you for a votary to the muſes.</p>

                     <p>Nature never formed me! ſo you mean it as a diſparagement to my perſon;—let me tell you, that I am the toaſt of the village; that John, our footman, is dying for me; and that Dick, the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener, compared my neck to the full blown ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower, and my cheeks to the beautiful crimſon of the opening poppy—Nature never formed me, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! Well then, one of the graces did; and

though every one is in love with my wit, I've more ſenſe than to run mad, as my Miſtreſs Matilda has done: but, I ſuppoſes, it is becauſe her father is going to force her to marry an helpleſs old Lord, when ſhe might have your maſter, a ſmart young Captain; but he has no money, and ſo he dares not openly to diſcover his paſſion. Well, for my part, I likes a young man that hasn't a farthing, better than a rich old Lord with his weight in gold.</p>

                  <p>O, Lord, Sir, my fear would not let me look, but I believe it was a dagger or a carving-knife: and ſhe uttered ſuch dreadful words that fill'd my poor heart with horror; my fear was ſo great, that I ſuppoſed ſhe had wounded me; but I think ſhe has not, I think ſhe has not—if I once get away from this houſe I ſhall be happy.

                  <p>Pardon me, Sir Lambert, for indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſiſter's weakneſs, for my intentions were laudable; I did it with a view to open her eyes, that ſhe might ſee the impropriety of her conduct. I found her breathing ſoft ſighs to the moon, and, in the language of romance, wiſhing for a youthful adorer. Chance threw me in her way. She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came enamoured with my perſon; but I believe had it been my footman he would have been equally fortunate. I beſtowed encomiums on her, which might have flattered an angel; and ſhe, ſuppoſing all a juſt tribute to her beauty, eagerly believed them to be true. Forgive me, Madam, for thus expoſing your ſecrets; I hope it will warn you to be more prudent in future. Believe me, Madam, I have a reſpect, nay, veneration for you, becauſe you are the aunt of my charming Matilda; but remember that your perſon has long ſince loſt its attraction, and I would adviſe you to lay by thoſe romantic notions, and become a uſeful member of ſociety.</p>
