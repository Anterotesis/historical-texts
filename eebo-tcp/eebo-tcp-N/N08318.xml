         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>SINCE it hath pleaſed the Moſt High, thro' the Riches of his free Grace, to give a poor ſinful Worm, ſome Acquaintance with himſelf, thro' the Revelatian of his written Word; and by the ſame Word ſome Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Affairs of his viſible Kingdom— In ſome Meaſure to know what are the juſt Rights and Privileges belonging to the Church and People of God. And by this Knowledge, I truſt, that I am put into a Circumſtance to form a proper and right Judgment of theſe Times, or the preſent State of this Colony: And if I miſtake not, the People of this Colony have gone off from the Word of God, in their Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in religious Matters; and adopted in the Room of God's Word, as a Rule of Practice in the Affairs of Chriſt's viſible Kingdom, their own hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Inventions, as this Book will diſcover. And what gives me Countenance &amp; fortify's my Mind with Courage and Boldneſs to confront the whole Colony, (Rulers and Miniſters) is not that I think my Abilities is any Ways equal with their's. No, I am far from ſuch a Thought. But it is from a full Satisfaction that the Cauſe that I have undertook in, is good, and the Lord's Cauſe; and that it has been by his Direction
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010621_0003_0F81BA65E6A7EB78"/>
and Aſſiſtance in the Main, that I have gone through what the following Sheets make mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt.—A Perſon with ſmall Abilities, preſerved in the Fear of the Lord, in a good Cauſe,—has the Advantage of one vaſtly ſuperior to him in Abilities, that takes up on the wrong or bad Side, as doubtleſs this Book will make manifeſt.</p>
            <p>But had the Author of the Explanation of Say-Brook Platform, or ſome equal to him in Abilities, ſubmitted their Powers to Jeſus Chriſt, in this his Cauſe; doubtleſs Points would have been handled, and Things laid open more to the Acceptance and Satisfaction of the People than what they are now done. But how ſuch Men, ſo prepared by their Creator, to do ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Service for their great Lord and Maſter, will anſwer for their criminal Silence in Chriſt's Cauſe, in the Things which this Book treats up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is for them timely to conſider. For I am bound in Charity to believe, that thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eccleſiaſtical Councils having Right to give Rules and Laws for Conſcience, or uſurp over the Church and People of God, muſt alſo deny civil Ruler's exerciſing the ſame Power; and that the eccleſiaſtical Laws of this Colony, denies Liberty of Conſcience, and robs the Church of Chriſt of her ſacred Rights and Privileges, I think cannot be deny'd. But thoſe that know the Truth, and will acquaint themſelves with ſaid Laws, and the leading Men that ſee theſe Laws
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:010621_0004_0F81BA66808CDE80"/>
to be wrong, neglecting their Duty in taking proper Meaſures to have theſe Laws removed out of the Way, ſo as not to hurt the Church and People of God, has brought the Neceſſity upon me, to venture to break the Ice, that Others of ſuperior Abilities, may be happily inſtrumental under God, to give the finiſhing Stroke, of removing every Thing, that is a Let out of the Way of the Church and People of God. The main Thing I have in View thro' the whole of this Book is, free Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience—the Right of thinking, chooſing and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for one's ſelf in Matters of Religion, which reſpects God and Conſcience; and to contend earneſtly for this important Privilege, I, nor any other Perſon ſhould not be aſhamed to do, coſt what it will:—if my Reader wilt acquaint himſelf with what it coſt our Godly Forefathers, that firſt planted this Land, &amp; Colony, to eſtabliſh and enjoy the Liberty that this Book is pleading for, he will doubtleſs juſtify me for this Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; for my Reader may ſee Liberty of Conſcience in religious Matters, was the main and leading Point in View, in planting this Land and Colony. And this is acknowledged by the Compilers and Eſtabliſhers of Say-Brook-Plan, ſee the Preface, Page 1. —<hi>"Among all which, this hath been peculiar unto; and to the diſtinguiſhing Glory of that Tract, called New-England, that the Colonies
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:010621_0005_0F81BA6730EC5290"/>
there were originally formed. Not for the Advantage of Trade and a worldly Intereſt; but upon the moſt noble Foundation, even of Religion, and the Liberty of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: with Reſpect unto the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Goſpel, adminiſtered in the Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and Power of them, a Happineſs then not to be enjoyed in their native Soil."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further writing of our Forefathers, what exerciſed their Minds, in leaving England and coming into this Wilderneſs, ſay, Page 3. <hi>"That which they were moſt ſolicitous about, and wherein their Liberty had been reſtrained, reſpecting the Worſhip of God, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church of Chriſt, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his own Appointment. Their Faith and Profeſſion of Religion being the ſame which was generally received in all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches of Europe."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, honeſt Reader, ſee how exactly this Teſtimony agrees with what this Book holds forth, and the Separates are contending for, it is not about Articles of Faith; but the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, and the Government of the Church, what reſpects Liberty of Conſcience, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing in Religion. They that juſtify our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers in their contending for their Right, in Matters of Conſcience and Practice in Religion, and condemn the Separates, that have withdrew or deſented from the conſociated Churches of
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:010621_0006_0F81BA678AE6CD50"/>
this Colony, and through the Knowledge of the Truth, ſet up and organized Churches, may read their Character in Mat. 23, 29. to the End; for you condemn thoſe that perſecuted and oppreſſed our Godly Forefathers; and you yourſelves are doing the ſame Things to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates, perſecuting and oppreſſing them, who are properly the ſpiritual Seed of our Godly Forefathers, and tread in the Main, in their Steps; as they walked according to the Word of God; and you poor Creatures, are to be pitied and prayed for, if ſo be their may be Mercy for you, for you walk in the Steps of our Father's Perſecutors. But upon the whole, if my La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in this Book, does not well agree or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port with this Teſtimony of our Forefathers Principles, and Practice in planting this Land; then Iprofeſs to ſtand ready to retract my Miſtake, upon Conviction offered me; but otherwiſe, I think no Man ought to be offended with the following Performance; but rather to conſider from whence we are fallen and repent, and put in practice the Counſel and Advice I have given to all Ranks and Orders of Men in this Book.</p>
            <p>Some of my Readers may think, that I have crowded too hard upon the Clergy in my Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But if they will take the Pains to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint themſelves with the Scripture Character of the Miniſters of Chriſt, and thoſe that are Hirelings, or that run, that God never ſent, &amp;c.
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:010621_0007_0F81BA6A78E46848"/>
And compare the Body of the Miniſters of this Religious Conſtitution of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> with theſe Scripture Characters, they will doubtleſs ſee that my Obſervations are juſt and ſcriptural. But I would recommend to my Readers, a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon upon this Head, from <hi>1</hi> Joh. <hi>1.4</hi> to <hi>6,</hi> upon the Tryal of the Spirits, by <hi>William Dell,</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel, and Maſter of <hi>Gonvil Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us College,</hi> in <hi>Cambridge;</hi> excepting the Author's Opinion of Chriſt in the Believer: which I think is not ſound; alſo his not making a proper Diſtiction between the Spirit and the written Word of God, as a Rule, &amp;c. Alſo, ſaying, the Believer is the only Book in which God himſelf writes his new Teſtament. Theſe and ſuch like Things, I recommend not. This Book was firſt printed in the Year <hi>1666, Hartford,</hi> re-printed in the Year <hi>1766.</hi> Now, Reader, it is worth of ſpecial Notice, how aptly this Sermon, printed a Hundred Years ago, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes our preſent Clergy in this Land. Surely this Author could not be prejudiced againſt our preſent Miniſters, before they had any Being; however my Readers may think that I am, when I have done nothing, but what was done a Hundred Years ago in the ſame Nature, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures. But to cloſe this Preface, I freely ſubmit myſelif, and this Performance, to be tried by the Word of God, there to ſtand or fall.</p>

            <head>The Author's Apology.</head>
            <p>IT is probable, that ſome will object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Performance, which the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Sheets make manifeſt, and ſay, that it is great Weakneſs in me, to pretend to appear again in public Print, ſince my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Performance was ſo much deſpiſed, and rejected by our good and learned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and the Body of the People of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut: And more eſpecially, ſince my Book has been confuted, and the Errors of it laid open by ſubſtantial Pieces, written for that End, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, My principal or leading Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, in my former Writing (nor yet in this) was not, who, or how many ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, nor yet how much Credit it would get among Mankind; either among the Learned or Unlearned; but principally to diſcharge what I thought was my great Duty to God and Men, and unburden my diſtreſſed Mind, and keep a chaſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to him that has Redeemed me by the infinite Price of his precious Blood. My ground Principle of Action in Duty, is not
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010621_0009_0F81BA6B61087F48"/>
how much Succeſs or Proſperity I ſhall have in the Duty; but to get fruitful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence in my Underſtanding, by God's Word and Providences, of what his Will is, in my Duty. This is enough to lay a ſolid Foundation of Action; leaving the Event with Him that governs all Things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Councils of his own Will. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap> my Divine Lord and Maſter did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Scribes and Phariſees, nor the Body of his Covenant People the Jews, that he was the Chriſt of God; nor prevail with them, to be truly religious; vain will it be for me; a poor ſinful, imperfect Creature, to think to ſucceed, more than He who is the Wiſdom of God, and Perfect in all his Works and Ways. Yet notwithſtanding, I humbly apprehend, that it is my Duty to labour in Love to God and Souls—to offer that Truth which is ſuitable to convince all rational Minds, (that are open and free to weigh Things according to their own Nature) what God's Will is, and Ways, and the Manner of his Working; as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects our Duty to God, and each other. And ſo commit the Performance entirely to God's wiſe and righteous Diſpoſal.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to my Book's being confuted, and the Errors of it laid open; what is done of this Kind, that has not come to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010621_0010_0F81BA6C1A36A1E0"/>
I can have nothing to ſay. But that which I have ſeen, I have a juſt Right to conſider; which has been in three Pieces, wrote by three different Men. The firſt, I think, was Mr. Bartlet's Sermon, from Gal. 3.1. The ſecond, ſome ſhort Remarks made by Friend Bowles, of New-London, the third, a laborious Piece, wrote by Mr. Roſs of Stratfield, Intituled, "A plain Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the Quakers, Moravians, Separates, Separate-Baptiſts, Rogereens, and other Enthuſiaſts, on immediate Impulſes, and Revelation," &amp;c.</p>
            <p>As to theſe Three Men's treating me; to ſpeak the Truth of my Neighbour, Friend Bowles has treated me more like a Chriſtian, than Mr. Bartlet or Roſs. For Friend Bowles took Pains to ſend a Man on Purpoſe, (as the Man told me) up to Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dletown, from New-London, to know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he underſtood me right, in ſome Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in my Book, reſpecting what I meant by the Houſe of God, and about the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and ſome other Words, &amp;c. ſhewing a Diſpoſition to get my Mind, juſt as I underſtood myſelf; which Conduct, ſo far is commendable. But as to his Opinon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Sabbath, and the other Things he faulted me in; I not having his Piece by me; and being ſatisfied that his wild No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010621_0011_0F81BA6D300D3948"/>
about the Sabbath, and the Scriptures, are in a Circumſtance, that there is not the tenth Part of Danger, that Perſons will be enſnared by him, as there is by Mr. Bartlet and Roſs's Performance. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall leave Friend Bowles at this Time, with his own Opinion of Things, to ſtand or fall to his own Maſter; and ſay, altho' Mr. Bartlet lives in the ſame Town, with me, and not ſcarce three Miles Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, yet he never ſhewed the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or chriſtian Part to enquire, (like Friend Bowles) whether he had got my Mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he publiſhed it. But I ſhould not fault him here, if he had done Juſtice to me, and the Truth, as it is written in my Book, which he has quoted to. The Reaſon why I did not write an Anſwer to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, when it firſt come from the Preſs, was this, That all that underſtood experimental Religion, the Eſſence of a ſaving Faith, of the Teachings of the Holy Ghoſt, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully read his Sermon, knew that there was nothing of Weight in it—A mere vain A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement to tickle and pleaſe the Ears of the carnal World; and feed the Minds of the Enemies of God and his Cauſe! ſo that the Sermon itſelf is ſufficient to ſhew the falicy of it, to all fruitful diſcerning Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, that I need not write a Word to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010621_0012_0F81BA6D9A977308"/>
it to ſuch. And thoſe that are Mr. Bartlet's high Favorites, that do not exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine or ſearch the Scriptutes for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but take what he ſayeth as an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. Now if I could write or preach the Mind of God, as perfect as the Apoſtles; ſuch Perſons, would likely reject the Truth diſpenſed by me. That if it were not for a middle Sort of Perſons, that are not ſo tightly glewed to the Miniſters, and yet have not attained to any great Clearneſs of dividing between Truth and Error; who have ſome Mind to try all Things, and to hold faſt that which they themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand to be according to Truth; I ſhall have no need to reply a Word to the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. But for their Sakes, and all that will labour calmly and uprightly to read Mr. Bartlet's Sermon and my Book, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark as followeth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Mr. Bartlet has made a ſad Miſtake, through the whole of his Sermon, which is common for all Perſons to do, that are ſo unhappy as to fall on the wrong Side of the Queſtion. He has begged the whole Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Debate, for he has ſettled the Point, that he and his Confederates in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry are right and their Churches; and never bro't a Scrap of Scripture or Reaſon to prove that they are ſo. Whereas my Reader may
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010621_0013_0F81BA6E6F53D840"/>
remember, that the whole Scope and Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then of my Book (which Mr. Bartlet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns) is to ſhew the Contrary, both from Scripture and Reaſon, that the ſtanding Miniſters and Churches in this Colony are not practiſing in the Rule of God's Word. Doubtleſs there are converted Men in the Miniſtry, and converted Perſons in their Churches, which we have ſoberly diſſented from. But we all profeſs to know, that converted Miniſters or Church Members, is not the Rule of Faith or Practice in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but the written Word of God. Surely then had Mr. Bartlet acted wiſely, and as a Miniſter of Chriſt, he would have ſhewn to his Hearers or Readers, from the Scriptures that he and his Confederates was ſpeaking and walking according to the Law, and to the Teſtimony; but he has not done it; and the Scriptures gives the Reaſon, Iſa. 8, 20, "Becauſe there is no Light in them."</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It muſt be allowed by all, that a Man to vindicate himſelf in any important Affair, will produce the beſt Evidence and Reaſon, that he is Maſter of, which I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Mr. Bartlet has done. Therefore, let any proper Perſon that knows what the Work of a Miniſter of Chriſt is, and that can diſtinguiſh Truth from Error, read
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010621_0014_0F81BA6F0E5FD710"/>
Mr. Bartlet's Sermon, and he may ſee that there is no Character nor Fruits of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of Chriſt through all the Sermon. For a Miniſter of Chriſt in his Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, will diſcover ſome experimental Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. But his Sermon gives no Scripture Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he knows Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. A Miniſter of Chriſt diſcovers an Acquaintance with the Work of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God upon the Heart, in the whole of its Work upon the Sinner, till he is bro't to bow to the Foot of pure Juſtice. Search Reader, and you may ſee, that Mr. Bartlet has not ſhewn the Need of any Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, (ſcarcely) nor pointed out his Work, in all his Sermon; indeed he has hardly intimated, that there is any Need of any Holy Ghoſt in Religion.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. A Miniſter of Chriſt diſcovers an Acquaintance with the New-Birth, John 3, 5. How the Work is wrought, and the Operation of God's Spirit upon the Heart, that is made holy, &amp; what the Exerciſe of the Mind is, that has Communion with God; alſo what are the Scripture Marks of Growth in Grace, and Heart Holineſs. All which Mr. Bartlet has left out of his Sermon.— And why?—Whether it was his Zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, made him forget the Eſſence of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010621_0015_0F81BA6FD60D2828"/>
his Sermon; or his Want of experimental Acquaintance with the Holy Spirit's Work, before and after Converſion, or the Want of an Author at Hand, wrote through the Spirit's Help, to have borrowed ſome Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, &amp;c. I leave him to ſay.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Once more. A Miniſter of Chriſt experimentally knows what ſaving Faith is; and that it is the Gift of God; alſo the Exerciſe of the Mind in the Soul's firſt U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt. But the Author has ſeen fit to deny the Deſcription of the Eſſence of a Saving Faith, which I have given in my Book, and to call me a Seducer, a Man of corrupt Mind, reprobate concerning the Faith; alſo that I am the Perſon deſcribed; 2 Pet. 2.1. "Who privily ſhall bring in damnable Hereſies, even denying the Lord that bought them." See P. 50—53. And at the ſame Time, left his poor Hearers or Readers, without deſcribing what the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a Saving Faith is; through the Whole of his Diſcourſe, altho' the Subject Matter naturally led thereto; for there can be no Goſpel-Obedience to the Truth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſaving Faith: And more eſpecially, when he undertook to ſhew the Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I gave, was corrupt, and ſo conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Soul-damning. What criminal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice is the Author guilty of, to leave his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:010621_0016_0F81BA708C4B6A48"/>
Hearers without any Knowledge of the true Way? When does Providence call louder upon Chriſt's Miniſters, to deſcribe Saving Faith in the Love, Fruits and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Effects of it, than when it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly ſet forth by a ſeducing Teacher (as The Author calls me) and yet no Deſcription of the true Faith held forth by him? Poor Souls, that ſubmit to ſuch a blind Teacher! that after all the Noiſe your Teacher has made about your being ſeduced and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in your Faith; his Labours among you give no Evidence that either he, or you have got any Faith, that will ſtand your Souls in Stead, in the laſt Day. Neither are you ever like to come to the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, by ſuch Improvements, through Time; for a Cart-Load of Sermons upon the Negative, will never produce the Poſitive, and Negative, Negative, is the Sum total of the Author's Sermon.</p>
            <p n="6">6ly. In P. 50, and 51, the Author writing of me, ſayeth, "And ſince God in his holy Providence, has permitted ſuch a Seducer," (with a marginal Note, ſetting my Name at large in the Margin)
<q>lately to make his Appearance amongſt us; who comes in the Manner and with the Spirit of thoſe whom the Apoſtle cautions us not to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010621_0017_0F81BA71B6FDD5C8"/>
receive, 2 John 10, 11. And he who has been permitted to draw away ſome from their Steadfaſtneſs in the Order of the Goſpel; has one of the moſt diſcriminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and diſtinguiſhing Marks, which the Apoſtle gives of a ſeducing Teacher. 2 Tim. 3.8. Men of corrupt Minds, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate concerning the Faith; and that he is unſound in the Faith, appears in his printed Book, in which many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are contained, and among others, one that ſhews the Faith that he holds, is not the Faith of the Goſpel, as it ſtands in his Book, Page 114, where he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes a Saving Faith thus, That it is the aſſenting to, and receiving Jeſus Chriſt, for what he is in himſelf, and not for what he has done for the Creature. Now this Deſcription of Faith excludes the Satisfaction, if not the whole Mediation of Chriſt, out of the Eſſence of ſaving Faith.</q>
Thus the Author writes of me &amp; my deſcribing the Eſſence of a ſaving Faith. And in Page 53. ranks me with the worſt of Hereticks. But I read, the Curſe cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſhall not come; alſo the Wicked is ſnared in the Work of his own Hands— and let his Net that he hath hid, catch himſelf—into that very Deſtruction let him fall, Pſalm 9.16. and 35, 8. Therefore,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010621_0018_0F81BA721F32CD18"/>
Reader, be pleaſed carefully to conſider what I have wrote; which the Author takes to be ſuch damnable Hereſy, which you may find in my Book, Page 115, 116, the whole Paſſage is as followeth,
<q>One Reaſon why ſome Perſons oppoſe us in our declaring againſt this doubting, is from a Conceit they have, that we hold Doubting a Sin, place the Eſſence of ſaving Faith, in a Knowledge that we are converted: But this is their Miſtake; for we hold, that the Eſſence of a ſaving Faith, is the Soul's aſſenting to, and receiving Jeſus Chriſt for what he is in himſelf, and not for what he hath done for the Creature; for many a Time a Believer has ſuch a Diſcovery of Chriſt, in his Glory and Excellency, that all the Faculties of the Soul, go forth in the receiving of him in his Fullneſs, with an immortal Thirſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten by the Spirit of God, to be made completely holy, as he ſees God is holy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at that Moment he may not have one Thought what Frame he is in, or what God has implanted in his Heart. But uſually upon ſuch a Diſcovery, the ſame Spirit of God that led out the Soul to receive Jeſus Chriſt, for what he is in himſelf, diſcovers to the Soul what Grace and Actings of Grace, God has implanted
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010621_0019_0F81BA72D03229F8"/>
in the Heart, according to what we read, 1 Cor. 2.12,</q>
&amp;c. Thus it is expreſſed in my Book, and purpoſly, to remove the Miſtake, that ſome had got of our Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſaving Faith, ſuppoſing that we held the Eſſence of a ſaving Faith, to believe that we was converted, or that Chriſt loved us in particular, or that our Sins was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, &amp;c. all which is contrary to our O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and well agrees with the Author's Opinion of Faith, oppoſite to mine.—For conſider the Word Eſſence; it is that which conſtitutes the peculiar Nature of any Thing, and makes it to be what it is, and without which it cannot be. Therefore the Author's denying my Deſcription of the Eſſence of a ſaving Faith; and comment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon it, as he has done in two or three Pages, plainly holds forth, that a Perſon that has the Eſſence of a ſaving Faith, muſt have a fruitful Underſtanding of the Offices of Jeſus Chriſt; and alſo Aſſurance of his Intereſt in Chriſt's Favor, or that his Sins is pardoned; ſo that Aſſurance is brought into the Eſſence. Alſo, that there can be no ſaving Faith without Aſſurance. This is contrary to the Scriptures, John 14. and all ſound Divines that ever I read. For if a Sinner, in his firſt cloſing with Chriſt, does not except him for what he is in himſelf,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010621_0020_0F81BA738B3D3668"/>
but for what he has done for him; then it followeth, that he muſt know what Chriſt has done for him, before he has the Eſſence of ſaving Faith; which brings the Perſon to have Aſſurance before he has the Eſſence. And I ſuppoſe this will not ſuit the Author: Yet I think this muſt be the genuine Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of his Remarks upon my Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of Faith.—For conſider where the pinching Point is, viz. and not for what he has done for the Creature. Note this <hi>not,</hi> is the Difficulty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And why? Becauſe it excludes all legal Righteouſneſs, Self and Selfiſhneſs, out of the Queſtion, in the Perſon's excepting and cloſing with Jeſus Chriſt. My Deſcription of the Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of a ſaving Faith, plainly ſuppoſes a regenerating Work of God's Spirit upon the Perſon that thus acts, Faith upon the Son of God; and that the Perſon, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Scripture Light, beholds that in Jeſus Chriſt that is infinitely excellent in itſelf; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divine Wiſdom, Power, Juſtice, Truth, Purity, Holineſs; or high, deep and bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Mercy; all which attracts the Soul with Delight, Union and Complacency, all which is intirely one Side the Conſideration (at this Time) of what is done to, or for the Perſon; neither is the Perſon, at this Time, concerned about going to Hell, but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010621_0021_0F81BA769212BD50"/>
taken up in what he beholds, out of himſelf, in another, even Jeſus Chriſt, or ſome of his glorious Perfections; in which View, he is ſurrounded with the ſweet Awe of God, divine Peace and Serenity of Soul, at the Foot of pure Juſtice ſatisfied, and in ſome Meaſure happified. Yea, thoſe Perfections of God, which ſtruck Terror and racking Diſtreſs upon the Perſon, while under the Law, now are the Delight, and great Satisfaction of the Soul, being in U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion therewith. And all this is a one Side the Conſideration of any Thing done for the Perſon; and is diſcovered in the Word of God, which I call the Eſſence of a ſaying Faith. But it is the further Work of the Spirit of God, through and by his written Word, to enlighten and inform the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Perſon, what is wrought in him, and done for him, and to inſtruct him into the Myſtery of the Perſonality of the Trinity; to diſtinguiſh the Offices of Jeſus Chriſt. In which Knowledge the Believer grows through Time, and ia a vaſt Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: But does not properly belong to the Eſſence of ſaving Faith; becauſe ſaving Faith is wrought in the Heart, before this fruitful, extenſive Knowledge, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. Let our Attention be to the very Expreſſions themſelves, and ſee whether
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:010621_0022_0F81BA77F997E198"/>
the Author had any juſt Cauſe to write as he has in Page 50, to 53. Obſerve,
<q>For we hold that the Eſſence of a ſaving Faith is the Soul's aſſenting to, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Jeſus Chriſt for what he is in himſelf, and not for what he has done for the Creature.</q>
Now had I have placed God, the Perſon of the Father, as the firſt Object of Faith, the Author might have had ſome Colour to ſuppoſe that I was an Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an or Socinian. But in as much as I have placed Jeſus Chriſt, the ſole Object of Faith, as he is God-Man, and ſo the only Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between God and fallen, ſinful Man, there can be no Cauſe for his Oppoſition. For conſider the Soul, aſſenting to Jeſus Chriſt, muſt imply ſomething diſcovered in him, worthy of Approbation and Choice. Alſo, the receiving Jeſus Chriſt, for what he is in himſelf, muſt imply the Submiſſion and full Conſent of the Will, with the chaſte Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of Jeſus Chriſt, with the Affections: And how is it poſſible for this to be done, unleſs Jeſus Chriſt is received eſſentially in all his Offices, as a Savior? for I underſtand the proper Meaning of the Word Jeſus, is the Savior, and the Word Chriſt, is the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed Son of God, or the Anointed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior. Which Expreſſions contain all that Jeſus Chriſt is, in this Gift of God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010621_0023_0F81BA7878F53510"/>
to a loſt World, or to the Soul that truly receives him, as offered in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. So that all that can be ſuppoſed that Jeſus Chriſt is to a Sinner, in all his Offices, muſt be implied and contained in a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's receiving Jeſus Chriſt as I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed. That upon the Whole, what the Author is pleaſed to call Hereſy, and ſo ſoul-ruining, I ſoberly &amp; ſolemnly believe to be according to ſound Doctrine, and ſoul-ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, according to the Experience of all the Godly that ever was, is, or ſhall be till Chriſt's ſecond Coming. I will cite a Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage out of two godly Authors, Dr. Ames, in a Book entituled Conſcience, with the Power and Caſe thereof. Chap. 10, of Love towards God.
<q>Queſt. 1. Whether is God to be loved for his Goodneſs and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in itſelf conſidered, or for his Goodneſs towards us, and Benefits con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd upon us?—Anſ. 1. The moſt perfect Kind of Love ſtands in this, that we love God for himſelf; that is, that the formal Reaſon of our Love being (as the Schoolmen ſpeak) the lovely Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of God, and that our Love be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried towards him as towards the laſt End. 1ſt, Becauſe that Love is perfect. 2. Becauſe if we love God, only for his Goodneſs towards us, then we love him
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:010621_0024_0F81BA78D72F39F8"/>
for ourſelves, and ſo we love ourſelves more than God.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. Edwards writes as follows, ſhewing the Sign of gracious Affections, Page 134.
<q>2. The firſt objective Ground of graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Affections, is the tranſcendently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and amiable Nature of divine Things, as they are in themſelves, and not any conceived Relation they bear to Self, or Self-Intereſt.—"Page 135. "A Change made in the Views of his Mind, and Reliſh of his Heart, whereby he apprehends a Beauty, Glory, and ſupreme Good in God's Nature, as it is in itſelf. This may be the Thing that firſt draws his Heart to him, and cauſes his Heart to be united to him, prior to all Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations of his own Intereſt or Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, although after this, and as a Fruit of this, he neceſſarily ſeeks his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Happineſs in God"—Page 136. This infinite Excellency of the divine Nature, as it is in itſelf, is the true Ground of all that is good in God, in any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect. But how can a Man truly and rightly love God, without loving him for that Excellency in him, which is the Foundation of all that is in any Manner of Reſpect, good or deſireable in him? They whoſe Affections to God is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010621_0025_0F81BA79947503C8"/>
firſt on his Profitableneſs to them, their Affections begins at the wrong End; they regard God only for the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Limits of the Stream of divine Good, where it touches them and reaches their Intereſt;—" Page 139. "Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the Exerciſes of true and holy Love in the Saints ariſe in another Way. They don't firſt ſee that God loves them, and then ſee that he is lovely. But they firſt ſee that God is lovely, and that Chriſt is excellent and glorious; and their Hearts are firſt captivated with this View, and the Exerciſes of their Love, are wont from Time to Time to begin here, and to riſe primarily from theſe Views; and then conſequently they ſee God's Love, and great Favor to them,</q>
&amp;c. Thus writes theſe Authors, and well agrees with the Deſcription that I have given of the Eſſence of a ſaving Faith, which I wrote Years before I read theſe Authors. But to return, and ſay, as to the reſt of the Errors, which the Author ſayeth is in my Book, I ſhall leave, till he is ſo kind, as to tell me what they be; for I muſt ſuppoſe that the Spirit, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Mind that governed in him in this Affair, led him to take Notice of that which was moſt groſs, and contrary to his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:010621_0026_0F81BA7A4CF12028"/>
of ſaving Faith; yet it appears to all Chriſtians, to be ſound Doctrine (as I truſt and believe.) Had the Author placed his own Name in the Room of mine, he would no Doubt, have made a right Application of his negative Performance. But I mean to write in Soberneſs; for Soul-Blood is heavy Blood to account for. My Heart has been in Pain for the Author, and the poor, periſhing People under his Charge. I have not altered my Opinion of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's ſtanding for more than twenty Years. I have been informed by his Hearers, that he oppoſed the Work of God's Spirit, ever ſince the glorious and bleſſed Work of God in the Year 1740, 1741, and ſo down to this Day of Reformation. Whitefield, that wonderful Inſtrument that God has improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for great Good to Souls—I have been informed he has called him a Deceiver and Impoſter.—And it is eaſy for all that knew Whitefield and his Religion, to know the Author's Standing; which calls for the Bowels of Pity and ſtrong Cries to God for him, that he may not die with the Blood of his Hearers in his Skirts.<note n="*" place="bottom">This Piece was prepared for the Preſs, ſeveral Months before Mr. Bartlet's Death</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2ly. I ſhall proceed to take ſome Notice of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010621_0027_0F81BA7B120FC780"/>
Mr. Roſs's Performance, as before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. (A plain Addreſs to the Quakers, Moravians, Separatiſts, Separate-Baptiſts, Rogereens, and other Enthuſiaſts, &amp;c.) But I muſt confeſs, that his Performance is ſuch, that it is difficult to make any other Reply than a general one, by Reaſon that he has been ſo unchriſtian-like in his treating of me, to rank me among a Number of Perſons and Profeſſions that I ſtand no more in Connection with, than he himſelf; and never point me to any Thing that I hold in Principle or Practice, counter to the Word of God, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Firſt, I think, Mr. Roſs, quite forgot in his Performance, the Apoſtle Paul's Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Rom. 2.21. "Thou therefore which teacheth Another, teacheſt thou not thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Thou that preacheſt, a Man ſhould not ſteal, doſt thou ſteal?" &amp;c. for he has charged the Separates almoſt with every Thing, but what is good, in his Book; inſinuating to the Public, as though we was ſome of the wildeſt Sort of Enthuſiaſts, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as a Scarecrow in the Front of his Book, an Account of the Dutartres, and the Life of John Lewis; which Accounts are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhocking Inſtances of dreadful Deluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And then, through the main of his Book, has diſcovered a great Zeal without
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010621_0028_0F81BA7BD3AC7408"/>
Knowledge; and has aſſerted ſome Things of the Separates, which is not true; and applyed the whole of his Performance wrong, as to the ſeparate Teachers, and their Churches; yet, at the ſame Time pretends to be a Man of God, an Inſtructor of the deluded and ignorant, when his Book gives him no ſuch a Character.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, Reader, is it not reaſonable that Mr. Roſs ſhould prove that the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates are guilty of the many Errors that he has charged them with, in his Book? Whereas he has done Nothing to prove his Charges, but his own bold Aſſertion, or the bare Aſſertion of ſome others in the like Preſumption with himſelf. Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us as in Mat. 7.12. "Therefore, all Things whatſoever ye would that Men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.— How harſh and unchriſtian-like ſhould I be to Mr. Roſs, to charge him with being an Arian, becauſe there is ſome in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; or that he was a Deiſt, becauſe that there was ſome in the Colony; or that he was a Drunkard, or Thief, becauſe ſome that waited upon his Miniſtry was ſo, &amp; he innocent of theſe Things. This Metephor I think, fairly repreſents Mr. Roſs's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to me, and my Brethren, in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010621_0029_0F81BA7C8AFAA758"/>
And if he ſhould ſee theſe Lines, I would entreat him to compare his Conduct with the Text cited.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. In Page 28, the Author has ranked Elder Pain, and myſelf, with Others that I know Nothing about, and quited a Paſſage out of ſome Author—but what Author I know not.—He has not fixed any Name to it, that his Readers may think, that I or Elder Paine was the Author of that Quotation. Part of which is as followeth,
<q>That though the Scriptures contain a full and ſufficient Declaration of Chriſtian Doctrine, yet they do not contain the whole Will of God, which is neceſſary for us to know,</q>
&amp;c. This Opinion I hold to be corrupt, as well as the Author; for I hold that the written Word of God is the alone, and only Rule of Faith and Practice, and contains all that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for us to know in Time, to fit us for a happy Eternity; ſo this Charge againſt us falls through for Want of Proof.</p>
            <p>Again, in Page 40, the Author, by the Margin Note, has ranked me with Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts and Deiſts, which, when I read, bro't to my Mind a zealous Miniſter's Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon my Book (as I was informed) viz. that there was not a Word of Divinity in it. His Deacon reply'd, if there is not a Word
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010621_0030_0F81BA7DC70DF820"/>
of Divinity in it, there is a great Deal of Scripture in it. So I muſt reply to my Antagoniſt, with the Deacon, If I am a Deiſt, my Book has a great Deal of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in it, for it was upon the Scriptures I founded my Principles, and vindicated my Arguments to prove the ſame. Had the Author been vindicating the Truth, or the Cauſe of Chriſt, as he vainly pretends, it appears to me it would been his proper Work to have cited his Readers to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in my Book, where thoſe dreadful Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are (if to be found) that he charges me with. It cannot be denied but that I have uſed the Scriptures frequently in my Book, to vindicate what I call and firmly believe to be the Cauſe of God. Therefore, he ſhould have ſhewn where I preverted the Scripture, and applied them wrong. But Nothing of this is done. If he thinks that it is a gone Caſe with me, as he intimates in the Beginning of his Book; yet I would charitably hope, that he does not think that to be the Caſe with all that read my Book. Therefore he ſhould have cited his Readers to my Errors, that he has loaded me with, to ſave them from being deſtroyed by me; unleſs he concludes that his Readers has no Right to hear and try Things, Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and Doctrines for themſelves;
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010621_0031_0F81BA7E2BE49280"/>
but are obliged to take all from his bold Aſſertion, as an Oracle; which, I think, is the whole Scope of his Book, by Reaſon that he has never undertook to prove, thro' his Book, that I, or any of my covenant Brethren, in all this Reformation, are guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one Fact or Error, that he has repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly charged us with; unleſs it be in Page 88, where the Author, in a weak and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Manner, preſumes to write as followeth:
<q>To prove that I have laid no unjuſt Charge againſt you who have ſeparated from the ſtanding Churches or New-England, in what I have now alledged, I might bring many Teſtimonies from ſundry worthy Perſons: But I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent myſelf at preſent with the united Teſtimony of Mr. Preſident Edwards, and Mr. Bellamy, in a Book written by the Latter, and recommended by the Former,</q>
&amp;c. and ſo cites a Paſſage out of Mr. Bellamy to prove his Charge.— Had he a cited a Paſſage out of Mr. Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel's Works, wrote againſt the Errors of them Times a hundred Years before we had any Being, he would have proved his Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as well as he has now done. For where has Mr. Edwards, or Mr. Bellamy, ſhewn from our Writings, or any other Ways, that we hold theſe Things, charged againſt
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010621_0032_0F81BA7ED11F8798"/>
us? Mr. Edwards is doubtleſs gone to Heaven; and I would charitably hope that Mr. Bellamy may get there too, ſo as by Fire, 1 Cor. 3.15. But I belive that he will love the Separates better than he has done for many Years back, if he ever does, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Alſo, in Page 126, the Author has cited another Paſſage out of Mr. Bellamy's Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, and ſaith, Mr. B. has had a pretty large Acquaintance with the Separates, &amp;c. But I think not ſo large as to ſpeak the Truth of them; for in the Paſſage, now cited, he ſaith,
<q>I behold, 1ſt. the Love, the ſelf-moving Goodneſs of God, in the Gift of his Son; but not (as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates imagine) that he loves me in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and is reconciled to me—</q>
and ſo on: Which Aſſertion is very falſe and ſlanderous, according to what Knowledge I have got of myſelf &amp; Brethren; yet as falſe as it is, it will ſerve the Author's Turn, to prove all his Aſſertions againſt the Separates. But I deſire Mr. Bellamy &amp; Mr. Bartlet, ſince they are Brethren together, in the ſame Cauſe and Profeſſion, to compare their Witneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Separates together, &amp; ſee how they agree or rather diſagree. The One condemns the Separates for holding to a Faith that ſtands connected with ſelfiſh Views, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Perſon imagines that there is ſome Favor beſtowed upon him, that moves
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:010621_0033_0F81BA7F8BFF8C68"/>
the Perſon to believe, and love, &amp;c.— The Other condemns the Separates (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther myſelf) for holding a Faith that ſixes intirely in Jeſus Chriſt, and receives him alone, for what he is in his own eternal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, excluſive of any previous Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of any ſpecial Favor beſtowed upon the Perſon, &amp;c. I cloſe this Remark with leaving theſe two Perſons to diſpute this Difference out that is between<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them, and get agreed; otherwiſe their Witneſs againſt the Separates will not be legal.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I had it upon my Mind to have made many Remarks upon Mr. Roſs's Book, but find, if I go where my Mind leads, I muſt write a large Volumn, inſtead of a ſhort A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology. Wherefore I conclude what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, under this Head, may ſerve for a ſufficient Anſwer to the Author's whole Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, as it reſpects the Separates.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt then. I think I have a juſt Right to exclude out of the Controverſy that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and my Author, the Quakers, Moravians, Separate-Baptiſts, Rogereens, and other Enthuſiaſts; and leave them to vindicate themſelves, as they ſee fit.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I have a juſt Right to exclude all that bear the Name of Separates, that have, or do meet with us in public Worſhip, that are not Church-Members, under covenant
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:010621_0034_0F81BA838E371190"/>
Bonds to walk in all the Laws and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt: And in this Caſe ſhall adopt the Apoſtle's Words in 1 Cor. 5.12, 13. "For what have I to do to judge them alſo that are without? Do not ye judge them that are within? But them that are without, God judgeth." So that I, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my Brethren in the Miniſtry, are no more to account for theſe out of Covenant, than the ſtanding Miniſters are for every corrupt, profane, immoral Perſon, that waits upon their Miniſtry. Now, having excluded theſe out of the preſent Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, the Matter in Debate is brought into a ſmall Compaſs. And who has a Right to look upon me, or my Brethren, guilty of the Things charged, without Evidence to prove the Facts charged? I ſuppoſe that I have a juſt Right to look upon the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's whole Performance, as it reſpects me and my covenant Brethren, a ſinful, and ſo a ſhameful Way of ſlandering his Neighbours, Indeed it appears to me, that in the Method that he has proceeded in, againſt the Separates, that if Paul was here in this Reformation, he could not eſcape his Slanders. But I leave the ſober, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Reader to judge, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I had a Deſign of tranſcribing ſeveral Paſſages out of the Author's Book, that thoſe
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:010621_0035_0F81BA8435C52EB8"/>
that have not ſeen it, might have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of ſeeing and judging for themſelves: But upon a ſecond Thought, find it will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large my Book beyond my preſent Deſign. Therefore I ſhall content myſelf with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing One, which may ſhew the Spirit and Temper of Mind in the whole Book. As in Page 54.
<q>If you were really hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, how come you to be ſo wiſe in your own Conceit, and to have ſuch a high Opinion of your own Gifts, Experience and Grace; and ſo much Contempt for all but yourſelves? Whence is it that you don't pay any Regard to the Reaſon and Judgment of any Man, or Number of Men, let them be never ſo wiſe, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; godly; but trample on all Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and their Determinations, but your own, with the greateſt Diſdain? Did you not make this one grand Plea, for your Separation from us, that our Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es were not pure enough for ſuch holy Perſons as you? Were you not afraid ſuch eminent Saints as you, would be polluted by having Communion with ſuch Sinners as you think we are? Is it not then a downright barefaced Inſult on common Senſe, for you to pretend to Humility, when your whole Conduct loudly declares that you are lifted up
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:010621_0036_0F81BA84F95C5380"/>
beyond Meaſure with Pride? But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it was powerfully impreſſed on your Minds, you were more excellent than your Neighbours, if you had ſuch an Impreſſion on your Minds, your own Conſcience, and Reaſon doubtleſs op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it at firſt, becauſe there were ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Things that rendered it very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable. But there was ſomething ſo agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the Impreſſion, you at Length gave Way to it, and now act upon it.— Now, can you think, can any Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that an Impreſſion that has puffed you up with Pride, and inſpired you with Diſdain towards Thouſands that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſuperior to you, could come from God?—What though you deſpiſe fine Cloaths, and new Faſhions, and exclaim againſt them;</q>
—and ſo on—thus the Author writes. Now, honeſt Reader, if you have not the Character of a Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Chriſt in Mind, I would adviſe you to take the Bible, and read it carefully, ſee 1 Tim. 3.2 to 7. Tit. 1.7, 8, 9. Matth. 28.19, 20. Now ſee what there is in this Book, that agrees with ſuch a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter the Scripture gives of a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt: What ſound Doctrine, Scripture or Reaſon is there uſed to convince us, if we were in Errors, as he
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010621_0037_0F81BA85906F94A0"/>
ſuppoſes? Not a Scrap. And indeed I ſee not why ſuch a Declaration does not lie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all Perſons, in all Ages of the Church that have true Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and take his written Word as the only and alone Rule of Faith and Practice. For altho' Elder Pain, and myſelf, in our Books pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, have laboured to prove, and, I think made it evident, that the religious Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of this Colony is not founded upon the Scriptures of Truth, but upon Men's Inventions. Yet the Author, nor any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy elſe, that I know of, has undertook in any ſober, ſerious Manner, to ſhow where we have miſſed the Mind of God, and ſo preverted the Scriptures that we have bro't to vindicate our Principles and Practice.— And till ſomething of this Nature appears, it will be a fruitleſs Chace to follow every party, proud, ſuperſtitious Perſon, as the Author appears to be by his Book; which Performance is ſuited to pleaſe the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Cauſe of Chriſt, and to blind the Eyes of the ignorant, and lead them to believe a Lie. But I muſt diſmiſs the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, and his Book, deſiring and praying, that he may ſee his unſcriptural and unchriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Performance, and have his Heart truly humbled, and his Soul ſaved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is probable that it will be objected
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010621_0038_0F81BA8650095CA8"/>
by ſome againſt me, for the following Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, ſaying that I am a deluded Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, a Miſchief-Maker, deſpiſing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermining our good Miniſters and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, in this Colony, endeavouring to make Diviſions and Separations in the Churches and Societies, in Order to break up our good Conſtitution, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, as to my being a deluded Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, I ſhall leave my Principles and daily Practiſe, with this Book, to apologize for me, and ſhew how far I am in the Truth, or out of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to my deſpiſing your good Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Churches, the Word of God directs me not to have Men's Perſons in Admiration, but to judge of them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Fruits, Matth. 7.20. or to eſteem them for their Work's Sake. 1 Theſ. 5.13. And by this Rule my Eſteem can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be very great, for Want of goſpel Fruits and Works to gain it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to my endeavouring to make Diviſions and Separations, &amp;c. my Study and painful Labor is, to obtain, thro' free Grace, a right Underſtanding of Chriſt's whole Will, as it is revealed in his written Word; and alſo for ſanctifying Grace, to practiſe the ſame, whatever it coſt me.— But if my Principles or Practice be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:010621_0039_0F81BA8716FFD910"/>
to the written Word of God; then be ſo kind and chriſtian-like, as to ſhew me wherein. But if it ſhould happen that by my holding to, and practiſing the Truth, Diviſions and Separations ariſe; then I think that it is high time for thoſe that make the Objection, to look about them, and to know where their Standing is.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is an allowed Point, that every One has a Right to vindicate his own Character; which Principle brings me under a Neceſſity to examine the religious Conſtitution of this Colony, and carefully compare it with the Word of God, before I comply with it; otherwiſe I muſt be accounted no better than a Papiſt, Mahometan or Pagan.— Therefore, to eſcape this reproachful Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, I may lawfully be juſtified for going through the following Performance in my Remarks upon the religious Conſtitution of this Colony. And in as much as it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that thoſe that make the Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Remarks, are thoſe that highly eſteem the Conſtitution; I need no more, but turn them to the Platform. Saybrook Confeſſion, Page 5.
<q>This Confeſſion of Faith we offer as our firm Perſwaſion, well and fully grounded upon the Holy Scriptures, and commend the ſame unto all, particularly to the People of our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:010621_0040_0F81BA87D61313C8"/>
to be examined, accepted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly maintained. We do not aſſume to ourſelves that any Thing be taken upon Truſt from us,</q>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here my Reader may ſee I am directed to examine for myſelf, &amp; not take upon Truſt from them. So that inſtead of faulting of me for examining their Plan for myſelf, I think that I ought to be commended for complying with their wholeſome Counſel. For if I diſregard their Counſel, they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſay,
<q>For an orthodox Chriſtian to reſolve his Faith, into Education, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, &amp; the Perſwaſion of Others, is not an higher Reaſon than a Papiſt, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan or Pagan can produce for his Religion.</q>
P. 6. Thus I find, written by that grand Council at Say brook; receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Miniſters, Churches, and the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly. So that if they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident with themſelves, it is a ſufficient A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology for all my Remarks upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, provided my Remarks be juſt, and according to Truth; and if I have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten otherwiſe, let him that diſcovers it ſhew me wherein, and I ſhall be indebted to him for his Kindneſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. As to my breaking up your good Conſtitution—it is one Thing to ſay it is good, and another Thing to prove it to be
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:010621_0041_0F81BA88996217B8"/>
ſo, from the Scriptures. My principal and main Deſign, is to vindicate what I ſoberly and ſolemnly think to be Truth, and the ſacred Rights of Conſcience. And if it ſhould ſo happen, that what I have written be the Truth, and ſhould uncover the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, tending to its Overthrow, I may be out of the Queſtion; for the Controverſy will properly fall between the Eſpouſers of the Conſtitution, and the Author of the Truth. And there I would humbly leave the Cauſe to have its final Iſſue; and only ſay, I have no Man or Men's Perſons as ſuch, in View, in my Writing. But would as much as is proper, ſeparate Miniſters, Civil Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and Churches, from the Conſtitution, and conſider this Religious Conſtitution as it is compiled or written, as though it was not eſtabliſhed in this Colony; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented here from ſome remote Part of Chriſtendom, for Examination, to ſee if it was according to the Word of God, and the ſacred Rights of Conſcience. In this Light I would earneſtly and humbly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat of the Reader to conſider and weigh it, and my Remarks upon it;—and when the Truth is underſtood a one Side; all Perſons then, as Truth is embraced or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by Perſons, we have a Right to ſpeak of, and make Application.

            <p>In order to proſecute the following Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, I ſhall endeavour to build upon the Rock Jeſus Chriſt (as he reveals him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the written Word) as laid in ZION, a chief Corner Stone, elect, precious, 1 Pet. 2.6. Iſa. 28.16. "For other Foundation can no Man lay than that is laid, which is Jeſus Chriſt, 1 Cor. 3 11. Pray obſerve. Not the Preſcriptions of Man, or Men, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies nor Kingdoms; but ſtrictly, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely

what is in the Scriptures of eternal Truth, before Kingdoms or Colonies was conſtituted or ſet up.—Jeſus Chriſt is the alone and only Head of his Church, Eph. 1.20, 21, 22. Col. 1.18. And the only Judge and Law-Giver, Iſa. 33.22. It is to him, all Mortals that are happy, of any and every Profeſſion, Rank and Order muſt have Recourſe, by a ſupernatural Agency of the Holy Spirit; whoſe Office it is to regenerate the Heart, and implant that Faith which operates in divine Love and Union to Jeſus Chriſt the Head; which Faith has a renewing and tranſporting Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon the whole Man. 2 Cor. 3.18. and engages the enlightened and ſanctified Mind to be ſtrictly conformed to God, in all his religious, civil or moral Actions. Phil. 3.8 to 15. Tit. 2.14. As Man by nature, is naturally inclined to tranſgreſs God's righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and juſt Commands, and ſo under juſt Condemnation. John 3. 18—36. So alſo thoſe that are converted, and truly u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited to Jeſus, have a new Nature through which they freely and delightfully do God's Will; it is their Liberty, Privilege and Happineſs to keep God's Commands. Eph. 2.10. 1 John 5.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. and whilſt the Believer ſo abides, there is no Condemnation to him. Rom. 8.1. Yea, that Perſon that, in pure
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:010621_0044_0F81BA8ADB4F97A8"/>
ſanctifying Light, ſees Jeſus Chriſt to be all, and in all, Col. 3.11. cannot, nor will not comply with any Articles of Faith or Practice, compiled and eſtabliſhed by Men, that he cannot ſee agreable to the Law and to the Teſtimony, Iſa. 8.20. or the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of God; altho' there may be Men united therewith that he eſteems as Men of Wiſdom, Gifts and Grace. Yea, if theſe Articles of Faith ſhould be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Laws of a Colony or King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; theſe are all too ſandy a Foundation for an upright Soul to act upon, neither will he comply with ſuch a Conſtitution, altho' he be threatned with Priſon, Fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots and Fire: For the Language of his Heart is, "The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is our Law-giver, the Lord is our King, He will ſave us." Iſa. 33.22. Again, that Perſon that by Faith ſees Chriſt to be All in All, ſees that his Conſcience is not his own to give, to pleaſe this Man or that; but that Jeſus Chriſt challenges the ſole Right of Conſcience, yea, the whole hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Soul, with all its Powers and Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to be intirely at his Diſpoſe. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this Perſon rejects all Challenges of Men, whether in the civil or eccleſiaſtical Authority. Rom. 14.4. Indeed, it is a granted and allowed Principle, by all true <pb n="46" facs="unknown:010621_0045_0F81BA8B8A808D88"/>
Proteſtants and Chriſtians, viz. the Right of private Judgment, or Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, in Matters of Religion. And right Reaſon ſhews that it ought to be ſo; for no Man, whether Saint, Prieſt, or civil Ruler, can ſtand between the great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible God, at the Judgment Day, to plead off his Neighbour from the Execution of ſtrict Juſtice. Therefore, it is the moſt unreaſonable Thing poſſible, for any Man, or Powers Civil or Eccleſiaſtical, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or deprive their Neighbour of the free Exerciſe of their Conſcience, in Matters of their Soul's Concerns. Thus far I would hope that I have wrote what the Reader's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience witneſſes to, that Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is a Perſon's unalterable Right, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to take into ſerious and cloſe Conſideration the religious Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion confeſſed by the Body of the People in this Colony; and will endeavour to ſhew wherein it appears to me, as I underſtand the Word of God, that it is not founded upon Jeſus Chriſt, as he ſhews his Mind in the written Word.—And ſhall begin with what I find relative thereto in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony Law Book.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt then, See Colony Law-Book, Page 165.
<q>Be it enacted, by the Governor, Council, &amp;c. That the Inhabitants of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:010621_0046_0F81BA8EFA83C068"/>
any Town, or Society, or Pariſh, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by this Aſſembly, who are, or ſhall be preſent at a Town or Society Meeting, legally warned; ſhall have Power, by the major Vote of thoſe ſo met, to call and ſettle a Miniſter or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters among them, and to provide for his or their Support and Maintenance, provided that no Perſons be allowed to vote in any ſuch Affairs, unleſs ſuch Perſon or Perſons have a Free-hold in the ſame Town or Society, raced at fifty Shillings, or forty Pounds Eſtate in the common Liſt; or are Perſons of full Age, and in full Communion with Church, in ;the ſaid Town or Society.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. This Conſtitution Plan, gives the General Aſſembly (which is, and always ſhould ſo remain, a civil Body, to tranſact in civil and moral Things) Power to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute or make a ſpiritual or eccleſiaſtical Body. This, I think, is againſt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of Nature, for any Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Beings, rational or not, to produce, bring forth, and make that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its own Being or Nature. Indeed, civil Bodies may make, &amp; conſtitute civil Bodies, but not religious or ſpiritual Bodies, for that muſt be above their Nature or Power.— But to come to ſomething more weighty.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010621_0047_0F81BA8FAC34BDF0"/>
Jeſus Chriſt claims the ſole Right of making and conſtituting Churches, or eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Bodies. See Pſal. 127.1. "Except the Lord build the Houſe, they labour in vain that build it." Pſalm 102.16. "When the Lord ſhall build up Zion."—Mind, Reader, the Scriptures does not ſay, When General Aſſemblies, nor Kings, nor Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, makes religious Societies or Churches: No, no; for they cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert one Soul, nor make no man religious: They may make Multitudes of abominable Hypocrites, which the Lord abhors; but not one meet Perſon for the Church of Chriſt. The Members of Chriſt's Church are made by the Power of his Word and Spirit, through the Means and Inſtruments he ſees ſit, in his high Sovereignty, to uſe and work, by. Iſa. 66.1, 2. Zech. 4.6, 7, 9. 1 Pet. 2.4 to 10. When Chriſt, by his Word and Spirit, has converted Sinners, and inſtructed their Minds by the Scriptures, in the Affairs of his viſible and ſpiritual Kingdom,; they being underſtandingly agreed in the Unity of the Holy Spirit, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venanting to walk together in all the Laws and Ordinances of Chriſt's Houſe — this is a Church of Chriſt, a ſpiritual Houſe, &amp;c. Amos 3.3. Rom. 10.10. 1 John 1.3. 1 Pet. 2.5. I earneſtly requeſt of the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:010621_0048_0F81BA90666CC2F0"/>
to turn to the Texts I cite in this Book, and labor to conſider them well, that you may better underſtand what is right and what is wrong, in this Enquiry after the Truth.</p>
            <p>Having briefly ſhewn that it belongs to Jeſus Chriſt, and to him alone, to make and conſtitute religious Societies or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; I think it is plain, that this religious Conſtitution that I am labouring to unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, uſurpes the Power above Chriſt, or, as Paul ſaith, 2 Theſ. 2.4. "Who oppoſeth and exalteth himſelf above all that is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God." I feel concerned how my Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will endure the plain, naked Truth. I would not for the World, write any Thing deſigning to ſtir Corruption and Party in the Reader. Neither dare I for a World, keep back what I think the Cauſe of Chriſt calls for; leaſt I ſhould offend my Reader. Matth. 28.20. Luke 12.2 to 6. I deſire the Reader to keep in Mind the Caution I have given, viz. to conſider this Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as much as poſſible, as tho' it was ſent here from ſome remote Part, to read, and compare by the Word of God, &amp;c. To return to the Words of the Plan, which are,
<q>That the Inhabitants of any Town or Society, or Pariſh, conſtituted by this Aſſembly,</q>
&amp;c.—Which ſuppoſes no
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:010621_0049_0F81BA90DF1974D0"/>
Perſons have a Right to form themſelves into a religious Society, without their Leave. No, if King George the Third, our right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sovereign (in the civil Kingdom) ſhould, upon any Occaſion, come into the Bounds of Connecticut, he has no Liberty to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God, according to his Conſcience, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs this conſtitution Head ſees fit, in their great Clemency, to indulge his Majeſty with Liberty, &amp;c. For the Truth of this Aſſertion, I appeal to the C. L. B. Page 169. where the Church of England Profeſſors came courteſing and bowing to, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federating with, this Conſtitution; to the diſcovering their great Weakneſs and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when the Word of God, and the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Conſtitution of the Nation, is on their Side.</p>
            <p>To proceed. I have another Figure to uſe, in Order to diſcover this Conſtitution, which is more ſtriking &amp; ſhocking; which is to ſay, That if Jeſus Chriſt was to come Perſonally into Connecticut, with all his Diſciples, he could not gather and ſettle a Church, unleſs he would crouch, and come down to this Conſtitution Plan; or that, in its Clemency, would allow Jeſus Chriſt, and his Diſciples, Liberty of Conſcience. If my Reader will put on Patience, and read with Meekneſs, I truſt you will find
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:010621_0050_0F81BA91B6708218"/>
this Figure made out, from the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Plan, comparing one Part with another, to take the true Intent of it: For it is plain, I think, to any Perſon that does not ſhut his Eyes againſt the Light; that this Plan challenges the ſole Right of making Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Societies, and the Government of Conſcience. Yea, I think that it aſſumes the Prerogative that belongs to the Son of God alone. And how that will pairs in the Court of Heaven, judge ye. For ſee C. L. B. Page 139.
<q>Nor ſhall any Perſon neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the public Worſhip of God, in ſome lawful Congregation, and form themſelves into ſeparate Companies, in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Houſes, on Penalty of Ten Shillings for every ſuch Offence, each Perſon ſhall be guilty of.</q>
Here, Reader, you may ſee a flat Contradiction, in thoſe that hold to this Plan, and yet pretend to hold Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Conſcience; when, as the Caſe may be, and has been, there is no Gap for one Breath of goſpel Liberty: For if we exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe our Gifts and Grace in the lawful Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, we are had up, and carried to Priſon, for making Diſturbance on the Sabbath. I myſelf have been confined in Hartford Priſon near five Months, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but exhorting and warning the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, after the public Worſhip was done,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:010621_0051_0F81BA926628E3F0"/>
and the Aſſembly diſmiſſed. And whilſt I was there confined, three more Perſons was ſent to Priſon; one for exhorting, and two for worſhipping God, in a private Houſe, in a ſeparate Meeting. And quick after I was releaſed, by the Laws being anſwered by natural Relations unbeknown to me, then two Brethren more was committed for exhorting and preaching, and ſeveral others afterwards, for attending the ſame Duties; and I myſelf twice more was ſent to Priſon, for the Miniſter's Rates. I muſt write a Volumn to acquaint my Reader with the Lord's marvelous Lovingkindneſs towards me in Priſon, and the Meaſures he took for my Deliverance. But theſe Facts may ſhew the Reader, that unleſs we become all Spirit, and take Wing up in the Air, to attend ſocial Worſhip where groſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables, Grand-jurors, Courts and Priſons cannot come, we cannot eſcape this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution Power. Furthermore, that my Charge againſt the Plan is true, conſider the expreſs Word of the Law,
<q>Nor ſhall any Perſon neglect,</q>
&amp;c. Note here, Jeſus Chriſt is a Perſon, and the glorious Perſon of the God-Man; and upon Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he was here, with all his Diſciples, the Plan has made no Proviſion for them; they wouldly equally expoſed to the Laws
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:010621_0052_0F81BA932CE42830"/>
as any poor Separate. And I think this cannot be denied by Perſons of Honeſty that will conſider the Conſtitution Plan.— For if Chriſt's holy and jealous Eye ſhould ſee the lawful Worſhip ſo remote from his Father's Will, Rules, and Laws, that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his Honor and high Dignity, he could not worſhip with them; then we have all Reaſon poſſible to believe that he, and his Followers, would meet with the like Treatment, from the People of this Conſtitution, as he did from his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing People, Jews, and Scribes, and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, in the Days when he was here upon Earth.</p>
            <p>Again, That the Plan that I am labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hold up to the rational, unprejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Mind, denies the ſacred Rights of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, is further evident—C. L. B. P. 232.
<q>That ſuch Inhabitants of Towns and Societies as have obtained, or hereafter ſhall obtain Liberty of the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, to procure, and have the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel among themſelves, for certain Months in the Year, diſtinct and ſeparate from the eſtabliſhed Place of worſhip in ſuch Town or Society to which they belong,</q>
&amp;c. The Reader may ſee that this Part of the Plan perfectly agrees with the Paſſage laſt cited, and challenges
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:010621_0053_0F81BA93D00AE730"/>
the Government of Conſcience out of Chriſt's Hand. For conſider what Chriſt ſaith, and what this Plan virtually ſaith.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt ſaith, as in John 4.21 to 24.
<q>But the Hour cometh, and now is, when the true Worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth, for the Father ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him. God is a Spirit, and they that worſhip him, muſt worſhip him in Spirit &amp; in Truth.</q>
Thus ſaith the Son of God; but the Plan virtually ſaith,
<q>Not ſo, Lord—we do not like your Opinion—it tends to ſtrike up all our good regular Churches, that we, in our Wiſdom, have made and eſtabliſhed by Law: For you give Liberty of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, and allow every One to judge for himſelf, which Worſhip is ſpiritual, and which is not—and that opens a Door for Separation from our Churches that we have made, and ſo crumble us to Pieces. Alſo, to deſpiſe the good Miniſters that we have made for the People, and opens a Gap for thoſe that think they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and gifted, and called of God to improve their Gifts, to ſet themſelves up as public Teachers: And ſuch an Allowance tends to make Diviſions and Sub-diviſions—and there will be no End, if this Liberty of Conſcience is granted.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:010621_0054_0F81BA9502300B18"/>
Therefore, Lord, it ſhall not be ſo— we do not like your ſpiritual Scheme of Worſhip—it tends to wild Diſorder and Enthuſiaſm. You ſay we ſhan't worſhip in this Mountain, nor yet in Jeruſalem— but we ſay we will—and draw the Lines preciſely, for every eccleſiaſtical Body— and the Committee that the County Court appoints, <note n="*" place="bottom">See C. L. B. Pages <hi>153, 254.</hi>
                  </note> ſhall fix the very Spot for Worſhip, and all People, within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of thoſe Lines, ſhall worſhip in that very Spot, Spiritual or not— a converted Miniſter or not converted, for a Teacher—and we have decreed, in our Wiſdom (let Chriſt ſay what he will in the Scriptures about ſpiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip) that if any Perſon neglect the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip, where we have fixed the Spot, and meet in private Houſes, he ſhall incur the Penalty of ten Shillings, and be committed to Priſon till paid.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The Scriptures ſaith, Zech. 4.6—9.
<q>Not by Might, nor by Power, but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord of Hoſts</q>
— his Church ſhall be built. But this religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Plan ſaith (in its own Nature)
<q>Not ſo, Lord—for our Churches will crumble to Pieces, if they are not upheld by the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:010621_0055_0F81BA9566392FD0"/>
civil Power: The civil Power made them, and they muſt uphold them.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Scriptures ſhew, that it is the Love of God, true Love to him in the Heart, that lays the Foundation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages a Perſon to keep God's Commands. 1 John 5.2.3. 2 Cor. 5.14. But this Plan ſaith,
<q>No, not ſo—there would be no Regard paid to God's Commands, if it was not for our religious Conſtitution.</q>
Again, God forbids that Men ſhould be forced to fear him by the Precepts of Men, Iſa. 29.33. But this Plan ſaith,
<q>That there would be no Fear of God in the Land, if it was not for our religious Laws, and the wiſe Plan that our civil Rulers have eſtabliſhed.</q>
Mind, Reader, Jeſus Chriſt, in the Power of his Word and Spirit, is all out of the Queſtion, with this religious Plan.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Once more, in this Diviſion. Jeſus Chriſt challenges the ſole Right of Conſcience— that a Man's Judgment, and his whole All be wholly ſubjected to him alone. Rom 14.4.
<q>Who art thou that judged another Man's Servant? To his own Maſter he ſtandeth or falleth.</q>
Chap. 12.1, 2. 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. But this Plan ſaith,
<q>Not ſo, Lord—if we have not the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Conſcience, our good Order, good Miniſters and Churches will all be
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:010621_0056_0F81BA96152D1CB0"/>
daſhed to Pieces—the Indulgence we, in our Clemency, have already granted, has given us a dreadful Shock—and if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign up Conſcience to your Government, it will be all up with us, as to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and good Order.</q>
Now, the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that this Plan hath, in its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is ſhocking; but it further ſaith, in all the eccleſiaſtical Laws,
<q>That, let Chriſt and Conſcience ſay what they will, we will be obeyed, or the Penalties we have annexed to Diſobedience ſhall be put into Execution,</q>
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>Thus, Reader, I have endeavoured ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly and uprightly to aſſert and ſhew my Lord and Maſter's juſt Right, as being the only Lord of Conſcience: Alſo, wherein the Conſtitution claims that Authority over Men's Conſciences, which belongs only to the Son of God. Having traced this Plan, to find where its Bounds are, and the Spot fixed for public Worſhip; I now come to take into Conſideration, their Choice of their Miniſter.</p>
            <p>Obſerve here, the Perſons qualified to vote, are thoſe that have a Freehold in the ſame Town or Society, rated at fifty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, or forty Pounds in the common Liſt, or, &amp;c.—Here I would note, that we do well to conſider, that the Choice of a
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:010621_0057_0F81BA96CB0A4B40"/>
Miniſter is a Matter of as great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance as any Thing that reſpects the viſible Affairs of Chriſt's Kingdom, here below. If the Miniſter be uncoverted, he is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to lead the Flock down to Hell. See Matth. 15.14. An unconverted Miniſter is an extreme heavy Judgment from God, upon a People; and a Man qualified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scriptures, ſent by Chriſt to a People, is an exceeding great Bleſſing: Therefore the Choice of a Miniſter is of vaſt Conſequence, one Way of the other. Yet ſee how this Conſtitution treats it— Obſerve, if any Perſon be in its Limits, having fifty Shillings Free-hold, or forty Pounds Eſtate in, &amp;c. altho' he ſhould be a Deiſt, Arian or Socinian; yea, if he be an Atheiſt, and have a Mind to vote, to keep out a Miniſter of Chriſt, I know not who can hinder him by that Plan; but if he be a profane Swearer, a Drunkard, or a Thief, they are as good Voters, according to this Plan, as the moſt holy, knowing, upright Man in the Church. Let us view this Part of the Plan carefully, and compare it with the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt ſaith, Matth. 7.18. <q>A good Tree cannot bring forth evil Fruit; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can a corrupt Tree bring forth good Fruit.</q>
Conſider, if the Church ſhould
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:010621_0058_0F81BA97FA200CF8"/>
conſiſt of twenty male Members, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, holy Men, and chooſe a Man qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified as well as Paul was, and the Society Members be more in Number, altho' they ſhould be all ſcandalous as before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet if they have the Money Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can out vote in the Church, and prevent them of their juſt Right and Choice.— What is this, but depriving the Spouſe of Chriſt of the ſacred Rights of Conſcience? Surely this cannot be a good Tree, that bears ſuch bad Fruit!</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. The Scripture clearly divides Saints from Sinners, in their Acting in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Affairs, or the Affairs of Chriſt's Kingdom, Ezek. 44, 7, 2 Cor 6.14, 15, 16. "Be ye not unequally yoked together with Unbelievers; for what Fellowſhip hath Righteouſneſs with Unrighteouſneſs?" and ſo on. Again, ſee John 15.18, 19. "If ye were of the World, the World would love his own: but becauſe ye are not of World, but I have choſen you out of the World, therefore the World hateth you." 1 Cor. 2.14, 15. "But the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God, for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. But he that is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, judgeth all Things; yet he himſelf
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:010621_0059_0F81BA9850D572C0"/>
is judged of no Man." 1 John 4, 4, 5, 6. "Ye are of God, little Children, and have over-come them; becauſe greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the World. They are of the World, therefore ſpeak they of the World, and the World heareth them. We are of God; he that knoweth God heareth us." Chap. 5, 19. John 17. 9.14. But this religious Plan confronts the Word of God, and ſaith, the wicked and Righteous may act together, in the moſt Important Affairs of Chriſt's Kingdom, viz. in chooſip"g a Miniſter for the Church: And a Drunkard, or profane Swearer, or Thief, is as good a Voter as the moſt godly Man in the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. By this Plan of conſtituting and forming Churches, and ſettling Miniſters, if the Society Members be more than the Church Members, and ſhould be ſo diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (not liking the Miniſter the Church has choſe) conform themſelves into Church Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with the Help and Approbation of neighbouring Miniſters, and chooſe a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter that ſuits themſelves. Now this new formed Church, if it ſhould ſo happen that there was not one holy Man in it, and the firſt Church all truly Godly, and in the goſpel Rule; yet the laſt formed, having the major Part of the Society, have Power to
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:010621_0060_0F81BA990BDD0878"/>
chooſe a Man contrary to the Minds of the firſt Church, and vote away their Eſtates to ſupport him. And what is ſtill more ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, is, that Money is the ſole Cauſe of ſtriping this firſt formed Church, of all her ſacred Rights and Privileges, that well might Paul ſay, Tim. 6.10 "For the Love of Money is the Root of all Evil:" For this Church falls below the Title of being lawful, and becomes unlawful, when they have not altered neither in Principle or Practice, &amp; are not only obliged to have their Eſtates halled away, to ſupport a Man and Worſhip which they know to be contrary to God's Word—but which is more ſhocking, to be compell'd to attend that Worſhip themſelves, or ſuffer the Penalty for their Non-attendance. Now if this is not to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Rape upon Chriſt's chaſte Spouſe which he has bought with his precious Blood, I know not what is. Surely the Lord Jeſus will, e'er long, revenge ſuch Injury done to his dear Bride, in dreadful Things in Righteouſneſs, and meet ſuch his Enemies in Robes dreſt in Vengeance. Read Iſa. 51. 22, 23. Chap. 63.1 to 7. Ver. Chap. 66.1 to 7. Zech. 8.2.</p>
            <p>My Reader may object and ſay, I carry Things to Extremes; and ſuppoſe Things that never was, nor like to be. Anſwer, <pb n="62" facs="unknown:010621_0061_0F81BA9CB6568D90"/>
I will grant it is likely that every Member in a Church may not be holy at Heart; alſo, that there is no Church in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution but what may have ſome Saints in it. Let this be accepted, then there is no Thanks due to this religious Plan. That what I have now ſet forth, does not happen daily, the Conſtitution admits of it, and, in Fact, has brought forth my Obſervation, in the very Nature that I have ſet it forth, only ſome Difference in the Circumſtance. Witneſs the Affair at Canterbury:—To give the Reader a full Narrative of that Affair would make a Volumn; but a ſhort Hint I think is neceſſary, to give Evidence to what I have noted. Therefore, according to the beſt of my Memory, as I have been informed, Canterbury Church was firſt ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered and founded upon the ſtrict congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Principles of our godly Forefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and being deſtitute of a Miniſter, they laboured to get one qualified accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Scriptures: But the Society (with their money Qualification) being moſt in Number, prevented. After much Debates and Labor between the Major Part of the Church and the Minor, with the Society, they differing about a Miniſter; the minor Part of the Church withdrew from the Church, and formed themſelves
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:010621_0062_0F81BA9D8953C1A0"/>
into a new Body, under this Plan that I am uncovering: Then they with the major Part of the Society, made the major Part of the Whole, and ſo choſe a Man to ſuit themſelves. The Church oppoſed the Choice—Firſt becauſe it was their Right to chuſe their own Miniſter.—Secondly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they looked upon the Man that the Society had choſe, not qualified according to the Scriptures, as their Objections ſhew, and dare not, for their Soul's Sake, ſubmit to the Choice, but ſtrongly oppoſed the Man's ſettling (they being the major Part of the Church, it was their juſt Right to have the Choice of their Miniſter, and that according to the Scriptures, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Practice of our Forefathers 1 Cor. 14.15, 16.) When the Council aſſembled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to ordain the Man that the Society had choſe, the Work was ſo heavy in the Circumſtance of Things, that it was three Days, I think, before it was accompliſhed. The Matter was ſo glaring, to proceed to ordain a Man over the Church (that had always been the firſt ſtanding Church in the Town) right againſt the Church's Conſent; that altho' the Conſtitution cloathed them with Power to go forward, yet I ſuppoſe that their Conſciences would not ſuffer them, till they had got the Society to vote their
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:010621_0063_0F81BA9D926B7FF8"/>
Conſent, that the General Aſſembly ſhould ſet the Church off to be an eccleſiaſtical So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety. And the Council alſo ordered their Moderator to prepare a Memorial to ſend to the Aſſembly for the ſame Purpoſe. (In ſo doing they put a Plaiſter upon their Conſcience, which was ſore, and ſo healed it, for a Time, never examining into the Nature of the Diſeaſes.) So they went forward, and ordained the Man (that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney had choſe.) I was Perſonally preſent when the Church gave in their laſt Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony againſt the Council's Proceeding to Ordination; and ſo the Church withdrew out of the Meeting-Houſe, as the Council went forward to ordain, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Here Reader, let me inform you, what I firmly believe in the Affair. That from the Acquaintance I got of this Church, that withdrew, they was the firſt Church of Chriſt, that ever my Eyes beheld, bearing the Fruits and Characters that the Scriptures give of a Church of Chriſt. See John 17, 6. "I have manifeſted thy Name unto the Men which thou gaveſt me out of the World. Ver. 14, "I have given them thy Word, and the World hath hated them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not of the World, even as I am not of the World, &amp;c. It appeared plain to me as Chriſt ſaith, that becauſe he had given this People an experimental
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:010621_0064_0F81BA9E4C8A2CB0"/>
Acquaintance with his Word, which they conſcientiouſly endeavoured to practice ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording thereto; therefore the Society or World hated them. But I teſtify that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt was graciouſly preſent with them, in their withdraw, with the enlightning, quickening, leading, teaching Influences of his Holy Spirit. The Word of God fell with divine Power upon the little deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed Flock of Chriſt: That I could truly and underſtandingly ſay, it was good for me to be there, &amp;c. But to return, to Matter of Fact, which was, that this Church now fell below the Title of being lawful; alſo under Tribute to the Society; and more dreadful ſtill, according to the Plan, obliged to attend Public Worſhip on the Lord's-Day, and hear the Man that Money had introduced into the Pulpit, againſt the Church's ſolemn Warnings and Rejections. Here Reader you may ſee my former Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations was juſt; for this Church was always owned to be a Church of Chriſt, and lawful ever ſince Canterbury had a Church, till now. But now ſhe is ſtrip'd of all ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Rites, and moſt valuable Privileges. And how?—Why by this religious Plan, operating according to its own Nature.— But what is her Crime?—Why ſhe has at this Time proved chaſte to Chriſt, her only
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:010621_0065_0F81BA9F1BE9E3A8"/>
Head and Huſband; in that ſhe would not leave his Word, Rules &amp; Laws, for Men's Inventions and Traditions. But my Reader may further object, and ſay, I carry Things too far, and endeavour to make Things worſe than they are; for the Society has voted their Conſent to have them ſet off, and the Reverend Council alſo. Anſwer, What if this ſupreme Head of this Plan, does not ſee fit to alter what they in their Wiſdom have planed, as a ſtanding Rule of Practice for Societies to proceed in, in order to ſettle Miniſters, nor to give Relief any Way that anſwers the tender, grieved, upright Conſcience? I aſk in Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, who ſhall anſwer at the Bar of God, for all the abominable Oppreſſion and Perſecution done to this Church, for fifteen Years together, notwithſtanding all their voting; not only puſhing them out of the Meeting-Houſe, that was built for them, in that Principle and Profeſſion to worſhip God in, and robbing them of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in it, but, additional thereto, ſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away their Subſtance, Horſes and Oxen, ſtripping them out of their Teams, in the midſt of Buſineſs; ſeizing Cows, Sheep, and poor People's Meat out of their Tubs, and other Utenſils, exceedingly wanted in their Families? And what is ſtill beyond,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:010621_0066_0F81BA9FDEA16288"/>
ſeizing and impriſoning the Bodies of this Flock of Chriſt, whilſt their poor Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are left to ſhift as they can! Neither have they done any Wrong to their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of this Conſtitution; no, not touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Hair of their Heads; but only lived in the Principles and Practices that they was educated and brought up in, with the additional Bleſſing of the Out-pourings of God's Holy Spirit upon them. Some of my Readers will likely ſay, that the Society is not to blame for this Oppreſſion, nor the Reverend and good Council, nor the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Therefore I aſk my dear Reader again, with my Heart full of Pain and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, for poor Connecticut, who muſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for all the dreadful Oppreſſion and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution committed (not only in Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but many other Towns in the Colony) under the Light of the Goſpel, when the Judge of Quick and Dead, ſhall be ſeated upon his great white Throne of impartial Juſtice, and Criminals, be they who they will, ſhall have no Excuſe to make for their cruel Oppreſſion and Perſecution? No, not that crowned Kings have enacted, &amp;c. nor yet that any haughty Monarchs of the Earth, with their decreed religious Eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments, nor the Eſtabliſhments of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, or eccleſiaſtical Councils nor Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:010621_0067_0F81BAA0A60984B0"/>
Votes; nor that this was the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Practice that was in Credit among Men. No, all ſuch Excuſes ſhall be ſwept away, as Refuges of Lies: And God, the great and terrible God, and poor Oppreſſors and Perſecutors, have a Meeting to have Things ſettled in ſtrict Juſtice for one whole Eternity, when the ſtrong Arm of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance ſhall be made quite naked and bare, to execute divine Wrath upon the miſerable Creatures. But I return to the Narrative. This Church of Chriſt, ſo oppreſſed, in ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Time after the Ordination afore-mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſent a Prayer to the Hon. General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, aſking nothing but what was their juſt Right, owning the Aſſembly as God's Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in the civil Kingdom; and Jeſus Chriſt to be King in Zion, and the only Lord of Conſcience. They alſo carried the Church's Records, ſhewing that they was the Church firſt formed in Canterbury.— Alſo, the Society's Vote, and the Reverend Council's Prayer, but was denied their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and obliged to bear the continued Oppreſſion (notwithſtanding all the Doings of the Society or Council) they bowed down, and let the Wicked go over them for many Years. Iſa. 51.22, 23. in which Time they ſent ſeveral more Prayers, without any Relief. And all this While they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:010621_0068_0F81BAA14C923748"/>
in ſome good Meaſure chaſte to their deareſt Lord and Maſter; yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, not continuing to watch and pray always: But a few Years back, thro' ſome Means or other (and I think it is high Time for them to know what, and repent in Duſt and Aſhes) have proved unchaſte to Chriſt, and have played the Harlor, in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to this unſcriptural Plan, that claims that Government over them, which is due to none but Chriſt alone. The Truth of this Charge may be ſeen in the Society-Vote, which the Separates (as they are now called) voted promiſcuouſly with the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety; which Vote may be ſeen in the Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Colony Records; a Copy of which is in my Keeping, but too long to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe. Had not this Caſe been publick, I ſhould not for my Right Hand, tell it in Gath, nor publiſh it in the Streets of Aſke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon. But they themſelves have given Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, 2 Sam. 1.19 20. "Let it be for a Lamentation, till their Captivity is return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, &amp;c." So I will return to the Wall, where I have, thro' Grace, dug, and found a Hole, and enter in at the Door, and take another Turn in this Chamber of Imagery. Ezek. 8.6 to the End.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, Reader, in the Page 165, where I firſt began my Search in this Plan, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:010621_0069_0F81BAA20FF75760"/>
the Qualifications that Voters muſt be found in, that chuſe a Miniſter, they act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Direction, ſaith,
<q>That the Miniſter or Miniſters, which have been or ſhall be ſo called and ſettled, ſhall be the Miniſter or Miniſters of ſuch Town or Society, &amp; all Agreements which have been or ſhall be made by the Major Part of the Inhabitants of ſuch Town or Society qualified &amp; meet as aforeſaid, with ſuch Miniſter or Miniſters, reſpecting his or their Settlement and Maintenance, ſhall be binding and obligatory on all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants,</q>
&amp;c. Now, Reader, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that you will readily grant, that that Plan which is formed for a Rule of Action, and flatly contradicts itſelf, ſo as no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can be formed from the Plan, to fix the Action, cannot be founded upon the Word of God, but muſt have its Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from ſome other Quarter. Thus I underſtand, is the Caſe of this Plan. For here you ſee, in the Paſſage now cited, the Miniſter ſo choſe and contracted with, ſhall be the Miniſter. Pray mind, the Matter is poſitively fixed—ſhall, &amp;c. Now turn to another Part of this Plan, and ſee how flat the Contradiction is. C. L. B. P. 169. Here you may ſee the Hon. Aſſembly ſee fit in their Wiſdom, to take into Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:010621_0070_0F81BAA37653A378"/>
with good Liking, and great Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, the Agreement of the Rev. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Meſſengers met at Say-brook; and to put their Sanction upon what they had agreed to, decreeing that all ſuch that united therewith ſhould be accounted law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or eſtabliſhed by Law. Now their being Enlargment made to the former Plan, we do well to ſee what it is. S. Brook Conf. P. 112.
<q>That, according to the common Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our Churches,<note n="*" place="bottom">A ſad Miſtake—for no ſuch Practice had ever been in the Churches, till this Plan introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it.</note> nothing ſhall be deemed an Act, or Judgment of any Council, which hath not the Major Part of the Elders preſent concurring, and ſuch a Number of the Meſſengers pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent as makes the Majority of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</q>
&amp;c. Now, let us put theſe two Parts of the Plan together, and hear what it ſpeaks, as the Caſe may frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, walking in this Rule, i. e. the Man choſen by the major Part of the Society, ſo and ſo qualified, ſhall be the Man; alſo the Man choſen by the major Part ſhall not be the Man. And why?—Becauſe the Vote of the major Part of the Elders pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is wanting; and ſo no Judgment can
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:010621_0071_0F81BAA3FB072908"/>
poſſibly come forth upon this Plan, in this Caſe. Pleaſe to look of it well; and do not be offended, becauſe I take Pains to hold it up before your Eyes, juſt as it is in its own Nature.—For ſo it ſpeaks—This Man ſhall be the Miniſter for the Society, and the ſame Man ſhall not, &amp;c. Now what ſhall the Miniſter, legally or lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly choſen by the Society, do in this Dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma? Why, if he has got a right good Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the Contract, and he chuſes to hold the Society to the Agreement; he muſt certainly have his Price agreed upon (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Society proves Knaves) and for this Reaſon, the Bargain was completed, both Parties agreed before either of the Parties knew how the Matter would turn, in the Man's being ſeparated to Office-Work. The Society muſt know, that the Man cannot inveſt himſelf into Office, and he ſtanding ready to have it done for him, not wanting, on his Side the Queſtion.— Therefore I think that the Society muſt make the beſt that they can of their Bargain; for this Plan hath bro't forth its own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to them, gave them a Miniſter, and yet no Miniſter. And ſince they chuſe ſuch a Rule to walk by, they have no Body to blame, but themſelves. Yet I am jealous that there is Hundreds in Connecticut that
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:010621_0072_0F81BAA4A6890168"/>
would be highly offended at their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for ſpeaking againſt this Plan; when at the ſame Time, the poor, ſuperſtitious Perſons know but little more of their own Plan than the Child unborn. A ſtupid, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, careleſs Mind about Soul Concerns, and the Affairs of Chriſt's Kingdom, I teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify, is a very heavy and ſore Judgment of God upon this Land; for Wars, then the Oppreſſion of a Stamp-Act, &amp;c. Now, as to the Proof of this laſt Obſervation upon the Plan's contradicting itſelf; I need no more but remind my Reader of Walling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford Affair; the Rupture and Confuſion this Plan brought forth there in ſettling a Miniſter. For the Truth is, the firſt Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty there got a Miniſter according to the Conſtitution, and the ſame Time contrary to the Conſtitution; which is to ſay, they got him, or choſe him according to the Plan, in C.L.B. Page 165, by the major Vote of the Society, and contrary to P. 169, which eſtabliſhes Say-brook Plan; and that requires the major Part of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders preſent to concur, which the Society had not; but the minor Part withdrew from the Council and ordained the Man, &amp;c. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed this Affair at Wallingford, has been a preaching Providence to me, and has been inſtrumental with other Things to introduce me into the Labor of Writing this Book,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:010621_0073_0F81BAA50A9D5C88"/>
to ſee the Learned, contending one againſt another, as their printed Pamphlets make manifeſt, and all for a Shadow. For who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is acquainted with their Debates may remember that the Conſtitution has been the Bone of Contention—One Party ſaith it means ſo, and the Other Party ſaith not ſo, but ſuch and ſuch Conſtructions it will bear. But the Word of God is all out of the Queſtion, on both Sides; for neither Party has gone ſo far Back, as to introduce that to ſettle the Controverſy, or produce what that ſaith in the Matter. Conſtitution! Conſtitution! is the all and all with them: Which has brought a Neceſſity upon me, (altho' moſt uneaqual) to produce the Word of God, and compare the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it, to know wherein it differs from that ſure Standard of Faith &amp; Practice. But I return to conſider the Method which this Plan has formed and fixed, in Order to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that Worſhip which is eſtabliſhed by it.</p>
            <p>Firſt then I ſhall turn the Reader to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der &amp; look upon a more antient Plan, formed &amp; decreed in the high &amp; ſupreme Court of Heaven. See the old Law Book, which ſhews how God's Worſhip was, and is to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. Deut. 18.1.2. "The Prieſts, the Leavites and all the Tribes of Levi, ſhall have no Part nor Inheritance with Iſrael; they ſhall eat the Offerings of the Lord,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:010621_0074_0F81BAAA8830AE00"/>
made by Fire, &amp; his Inheritance: therefore ſhall they have no Inheritance among their Brethren: the Lord is their Inheritance, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong their Brethren; the Lord is their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, as he hath ſaid unto them." Pray mind the Direction given, "they ſhall eat the Offerings of the Lord made by Fire;" and what they be, may be ſeen, in Num. 18. 9. "This ſhall be thine of the Moſt Holy Things reſerved from the Fire every Oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theirs;" and ſo on thro' the Ch. Mind V. 20. "And the Lord ſpake unto Aaron, thou ſhalt have no Inheritance in their Land; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhalt thou have any Part among them; I am thy Part and thine Inheritnce among the Children of Iſrael," This, in ſhort, from the Old Teſtament; all which ſhews that their is no Allowance for the Prieſts and the People, to come into any legal Contract or Bargain; becauſe the Lord has fixed the Way and Manner, of the Prieſts' Support; which was the People's attending in a free Way &amp; Manner, to wait upon the Worſhip of God, with the Offerings that he had appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and no civil Power concerned to puniſh the Neglect. See Mal. 3.8.9. "Will a Man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me, but ye ſay, wherein have we robbed thee? in Tithes and Offerings. Ye are curſed, with a Curſe, for ye have robbed me, even this whole Nation." Note here, God does not
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:010621_0075_0F81BAAC2DA1F608"/>
ſay, ye have robbed the Prieſts, or one Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. "But ye have robbed me." Nor ye have broke your Words, or ye have not fulfiled your civil Contract: therefore fulfil it, pay up the Arrearage, or elſe the civil Rulers ſhall take Care that it is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, &amp;c. No, no, not a Word of this in all the Scriptures. What then? why repent, and turn to God and his Ordinances, and now practice in your Duty.—Bring ye all the Tithes, &amp;c. and I will pour you out a Bleſſing, &amp;c. It cannot be tho't that God would have taught his People to break le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal or civil Contracts. Therefore, we may aſſuredly gather, that there never was not any between the Prieſts and People, except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing One; and that may be read at large in Judges 17 Chap. and this agrees with the Conſtitution Plan, and in my humble Opinion, is the only Text in the Bible that comes to the Caſe of a Miniſter and People contracting together for the Miniſter's year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Service, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="2">2ndly. Let us turn our Eye a Minute to the new Law Book, decreed by the ſame Authority as the Old before-mentioned, and ſee what it ſaith about the Miniſters of Chriſt, and their Support. Matth. 10.8, 9. "Freely ye have received, freely give.— Provide neither Gold, nor Silver, nor Braſs in your Purſe." Luke 10. 7. "And in the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:010621_0076_0F81BAAC938DF758"/>
ſame Houſe remain eating and drinking ſuch Things as they ſhall give, for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer is worthy of his Hire." 1 Pet. 5.2. "Feed the Flock of God which is among you, taking the Overſight thereof, not by Conſtraint, but willingly, not for filthy Lucre, but of a ready Mind." 1 Cor. 9.13, 14. "Do you not know that they which miniſter about holy Things, live of the Things of the Temple? and they which wait at the Altar, are Partakers with the Altar? Even ſo hath the Lord ordained, that they which preach the Goſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel." Here take Notice, that the New-Teſtament perfectly agrees with the Old, and refers back to the Support of God's Worſhip under the Law, and then ordains the like Plan under the Goſpel, differing Nothing in their Nature, only in their Circumſtance. Under the Law, God's Worſhip was ſupported from God's ſpecial Command, by the People's Free-offerings: So is the Rule now fixed by the Decree of Heaven. Note—Even ſo hath the Lord or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained—that the People ſhould freely contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to the Support of the Goſpel now, &amp;c. But I mean not to diſcourſe this Point here, in as much as I have already done it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what largely, in my Book, printed in the Year 1750, holding forth in a Diſcourſe, the great Privileges of the Church of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:010621_0077_0F81BAAD4D2904C0"/>
Chriſt, to which I would refer the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for the full Proof of this Point: And ſo paſs on to hear what this religious Plan ſaith in this Affair, counter to the Word of God—which is ſomething to this Purport —
<q>Lord, we do not like your Plan—for, according to that, long Experience teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that ſometimes Miniſters will be pinched for the Want of many Things —they may ſuffer Hunger, Cold, Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 2 Cor. 11.28. therefore we chuſe to prevent all theſe Difficulties. You ſay that they ſhould have no Inheritance with their Brethren (by any legal Bargain) but we do not like that Plan—we decree that they ſhall have ſo much Settlement, and ſo much Yearly—near as good a Home Lot, and as fine a Houſe as any in the Society—we chuſe that they ſhould be as grand, and live as high, and wear as good Cloaths as any in the Society, and appear like honorable Gentlemen.— Furthermore, your Plan holds forth, that the Miniſter ſhould live by the free-will Offering of the People; but we think that is high Preſumption—for by that Rule, three Quarters of our good Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters would ſtarve, or take to ſome other Buſineſs, for to get their Bread: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we are bound by the Law of Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, in the Exerciſe of the utmoſt of
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:010621_0078_0F81BAAE0D7E8B48"/>
our Wiſdom, to tax every one according to their Liſt, in the Compaſs of ſuch Lines as we in our Wiſdom have ſet, to ſecure to our Miniſters, the full of their civil Contract, made with the Society's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee—and that by the civil Power of the whole Colony, diſtraining of Goods or impriſoning the Body, to effect our Deſign.</q>
I note here, that if the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector ſhould have his Conſcience waked up (as has been the Caſe, and may ſtill be) to think it is Oppreſſion to ſtrain away the Goods, or impriſon the Bodies of thoſe that never worſhipped with them, nor ſtand in no Connection with them in religious Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or whatever the Difficulty be; if the Collector hath not made up with the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in two Months after his Salary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes due, then the Select Men, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, have Power to take out a Diſtreſs, legally inveſted with Power to get, out of the Collector's Eſtate, what is behind, due to the Miniſter. So that the Conſtitution regards not God, nor Conſcience—they ſhan't ſtop its Deſign, &amp;c. But if the Select Men, or Committee, neglect their Duty to the Collectors: And if it ſhould be by the Light of Truth, ſhining in their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, ſhewing that the forcing Men to pay, contrary to their Conſciences, and
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:010621_0079_0F81BAAED264D4F0"/>
where they never contracted, was repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Word of God; then they muſt be fined three Pounds. But how ſhall theſe Neglects and Penalties be recovered? Why ſince it is of ſuch a criminal Nature, it muſt be by the King's Attorney, to be ſure. See C.L.B. Page 166.
<q>All which ſhall be recovered by Action, brought by the King's Attorney, to the County Court, in the ſame County, and no Appeal or Review ſhall be granted in ſuch Caſe,</q>
&amp;c. Now, how near this agrees with the Laws of the Medes and Perſians, the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er may judge. Alſo, how repugnant to Engliſh Liberties and Cuſtoms. I ſhall cloſe this Head by obſerving, that the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of God's working, in the carrying on the Affairs of his viſible Kingdom, is by improving the common and ſpecial Gifts of Grace that he has given to the Children of Men, according to the End for which he has given them. But this Plan counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works God's Method of working. For In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: There may be two Men, equal in Eſtate, liſted alike; one of them created with a ſpecial Gift of Hoſpitality, and act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Liberty of his Mind, will give double to the Support of the Goſpel, as the other, and the other not to be charged with Covetouſneſs. Again, two Men may be
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:010621_0080_0F81BAAFA2A85C38"/>
equal In the Liſt—One thro' the Means of his ſuperior Gifts of managing civil Affairs, may give as much again as his Neighbour, and not hurt his Eſtate or Family; and the next Year the ſame Man may be equal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in the Liſt, and he that gave moſt, be able to give more ſtill, and the other be upon a ſick Bed, or thro' the Means of ſome croſs Providence, not be able to give any Thing; yet, being equal in the Liſt, this Plan has an equal Challenge upon Both; which I think is counter to the Scriptures, and Providence, and well agrees with the Story of the Iron Bedſtead, which required all to be cut off that was longer, and all too ſhort, to be ſtretched to its Length. &amp;c. I ſhall now proceed to take another Turn in this Chamber of Imagery.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. It is readily granted, that the Word of God is the alone Rule of Faith and Practice. A Church that is deſtitute of a Paſtor, ought then to have Recourſe directly to the Word of God to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, with the Qualifications which that aſſerts ſhall be found in the Man to be ſet over them in the Lord. And if it ſhould ſo happen (as I believe it may again and again, in this Day of dreadful Apoſtacy from God and his Word) that the Church cannot light of a Man in the Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:010621_0081_0F81BAB064D52360"/>
which the Scriptures gives, ſo that they are without a preached Goſpel a Year or Years, what then? Why this Providence has ſtripped the poor Flock, of the ſacred Rights of Conſcience, and there is another Head than Chriſt impoſed upon them.— Who ſhall provide a Miniſter for them? Let Chriſt ſay what he will, about the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications of his Miniſters, or charge his Church never ſo ſolemnly to be aware of diſqualified Perſons. See the laſt cited Page with Page 167.
<q>And that if any Town or Society, ſhall be for any Year or Years without a Miniſter preaching the Goſpel to them; ſuch Town or Society ſhall, in the ſaid Year or Years, pay ſuch Sum or Payments as the General Court ſhall appoint; of which Payment or Payments the Collector, or Collectors, who ſhall collect the ſame, ſhall make a Certificate to the next County Court, of that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which Court ſhall diſpoſe of, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſaid Sums for the Uſe of the Miniſtry in the Town or Society where it is collected, as ſoon as Opportunity may be had for it, according to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Court.</q>
Thus is decreed by the Plan: But if it were needful, I ſhould inquire, What if Opportunity ſhould not preſent for a Year, or more, for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:010621_0082_0F81BAB113F56FA0"/>
Court to hire a Man? What is to be done in ſuch a Caſe? For every Plan ought to reach its own Deſign. But this is not ſo likely to happen, if we conſider how plenty thoſe are which this Plan calls and makes Preachers. See 2 Tim. 4.3, 4. "For the Time will come, when they will not endure ſound Doctrine; but after their own Luſts, ſhall they heap to themſelves Teachers, having itching Ears. Obſerve, this Plan hath no Regard to the Scriptures for a Rule to walk by in this Caſe: For the Word of God inveſts the Church with Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to chuſe a Man to preach to them; but this Plan, in the Caſe now ſet forth, inveſts the County Court with that Buſineſs. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it appears to me, that this Plan can keep to themſelves as many Teachers as they pleaſe, if they have but Money enough, and common Senſe or Abilities to learn: And if it ſhould happen that they fall ſome ſhort of common Senſe, a good Stock of Money will likely ſupply that Defect; for if you take a fair Proſpect of this Plan, Money is the eſſential Foundation, and has the caſting Vote through the whole Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Therefore, ſince the Caſe may be ſo, that the County Court muſt thruſt Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in upon us, whether we will or not, I think it is high Time for all Freemen of
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:010621_0083_0F81BAB1D5621730"/>
this Colony to wake up in earneſt, and not reſt Night nor Day, till they obtain, thro' free Grace, the ſaving Knowledge of the Truth, ſo as to diſtinguiſh the Affairs of Chriſt's Kingdom—alſo, to diſcern between the Righteous and the Wicked. Mal. 3, 18. 1 Cor. 2.14, 15, 16. that they may chuſe wiſe, diſerning, godly Men, to be Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the General Aſſembly; ſo that they, being concerned for the Honor of God, and the Good of Souls, may put no Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es into the County Court, but ſuch as love Zion's Proſperity, and well diſtinguiſh from the Word of God, who are qualified for the Miniſtry, and who not: otherwiſe you are in the utmoſt Danger poſſible, of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving blind Guides ſet over you, and Chriſt ſhews the awful Conſequence, Mat. 15.14.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly. Once more, and I ſhall diſmiſs this Part of the Plan which the Colony Law Book holds forth. See Pages 153, 154.— Here the Plan commits the whole Affair of inſpecting and ordering the building of Meeting-Houſes for public Worſhip to the County Court. And altho' there be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that effects Conſcience, in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Building, yet there is in the Manner of Building, becauſe the Plan requires Force, Taxes, and Priſons, to effect its Deſigns, which is contrary to the Word of God.
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:010621_0084_0F81BAB28CE67D80"/>
Exod. 35.4, 5. "This is the Thing which the Lord commanded, ſaying, Take ye from amongſt you an Offering unto the Lord —whoſoever is of a willing Heart, let him bring it." Chapt. 36.5.6, 7. Ezra 2.68. "And ſome of the chief of the Fathers, when they came to the Houſe of the Lord which is at Jeruſalem, offered freely, for the Houſe of God, to ſet it up in his Place." Thus the Scriptures decrees, thro' all the ſacred Volumns; for perfect Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom never contradicts his own Plan. There is no civil Tax, nor civil Rulers, nor Priſons concerned in the whole Affair. But this Plan is formed quite a one Side of the Scriptures, and leaves no Room for a proper, ſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Trial, to know whether its Adherents act from Love to God or not, for Love or not Love, party Envy or Hatred, it is all of a Piece with this Plan; for it has found out a Way, if there be Power enough in the Colony, to drive their Deſigns through, hit or miſs (as we uſed to ſay) if there was any Right to uſe the civil Sword in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, I think they diſcover poor Policy, and fiery Zeal to uſe it before there is Need: For if the Society agrees to a Man upon the Spot to ſet their Meeting-Houſe, and preſume to do it without firſt procuring the Court's Liberty, they incur the Penalty of forty Pounds to the Treaſury, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="unknown:010621_0085_0F81BAB3598DFE00"/>I ſhould in the next Place, enter upon the Conſideration of Say-brook Plan; but there is two Pieces that ſtand ſomething in my Way, which I muſt endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, in order to go ſtreight forward with my Deſign. The firſt, an Explanation of Say-brook Platform; the ſecond an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to illuſtrate and confirm the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Conſtitution, of the conſociated Churches in the Colony of Connecticut, wrote by Mr. Hobart of Fairfield Paſtor of a Church there.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe Books, the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of which is to ſhew the true Intent of Say-brook Platform, or Plan—Firſt I ſhall obſerve and ſay, if the Author of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation had ſaid, that the Say-brook Plan ought to have been ſo compiled as he has explained, he would have ſaid Something to the Purpoſe or what Truth requires; or if there can be ſuch a Thing in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or in Chriſt's ſpiritual Kingdom, that a bad Thing can be made good; then I muſt grant that the Author has done it compleatly. But this is what I much queſtion, and cannot yet believe: I rather chooſe to believe what Chriſt ſaith in this Caſe, Matth. 12.33. "Either make the Tree good, and his Fruit good; or elſe make the Tree corrupt, and his Fruit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt;
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:010621_0086_0F81BAB480FFAD20"/>
for the Tree is known by his Fruit." Now I will readily grant, that in any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer, whether Articles of Faith or Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that when it appears, that there is an accidental Word or Sentence dropped that does not comport with the Whole, it ought to be corrected. But the Caſe is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe here in my Opinion. Obſerve, here is Articles compiled, plain and explicit; and if they do not agree with the Reſt of the Plan, they alone muſt bear it. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not like the Method the Author has taken, to make this Plan good. I think by the ſame Rule of Proceeding, a Man of his ſuperior Abilities, may make almoſt any corrupt Plan to paſs; for almoſt every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Plan has Something in them ſound and good. Therefore take that which is ſound for the Principle, and explain the Reſt to comport therewith, and almoſt any Thing will paſs, in ſuch a Way of reconciling Things. But I am inclined to think that the Compilers and Enacters of them Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, deſigned they ſhould be as they really are expreſſed, for two Reaſons.—Firſt in the Conſideration that the Reverend Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil at Say-brook, was Men, doubtleſs of conſiderable Abilities, well underſtanding Terms and Diſtinctions, in Principles, who had been inſtructed all their Days, in the
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:010621_0087_0F81BAB4D3CC5FE8"/>
Congregational Principles and Diſpcipline; that, had them Principles ſuited the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, there they was compiled to their Hand, and nothing wanted, but to adopt them in as they had the Articles of Faith. But to me it is evident, that the Congregational Plan of Government did not reach their Deſign.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I have from Time been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, that about that Time Say-brook Plan was agreed upon, and for ſome Time before, the Body of the Clergy grew uneaſy with their Lot, as being Servants to the Churches (as Chriſt has appointed their Lot) but choſe rather to be Lords. Therefore them Articles of Diſcipline was compiled juſt according to their Spirit and Deſign, and added to the Articles of Faith in the congregational Plan. I am further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this Opinion, by what I find wrote by Mr. Increaſe Mather of Boſton, in the Year 1700, in a Book, entitled, "The Order of the Churches in New-England vindicated." Page 12.
<q>If the begun A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy ſhould proceed as faſt the next thirty Years as it has done theſe laſt, ſurely it will come to that in New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (except the Goſpel itſelf depart with the Order of it) that the moſt conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious People therein will think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelve
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:010621_0088_0F81BAB58AFCAEE0"/>
concerned to gather Churches out of Churches.</q>
See alſo in Page 8; in both which it appears to me that this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Man had a right Underſtanding of them, and theſe Times alſo, and foreſee what God is now doing in this Reformation, in ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating from this Conſtitution; which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution he then ſaw in Embryo, but not then brought forth. But to return: The Council at Saybrook, adding that uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Form of Diſcipline to the congreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Plan, is the Cauſe (in my humble O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion) of all the Contradiction and Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Indeed, I think the Nature of this, Mr. Hobart has made evident in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to this Author: But he is far, very far from making the Application that I do, or conſenting to the Caſe that I aſſign, &amp;c. But I have a Right to think for myſelf, and muſt deſcent from the Author and Mr. Hobart too: They both labour to make the Plan good, but in very wide and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Senſes. And as to each of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out what they undertook, I think they have both failed of making good their Deſign: Yet this I gather from their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that the Author of the Explanation, diſcovers a Mind to vindicate the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational Principles. I am far from being ſo uncharitable as Mr. Hobart is, that he
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:010621_0089_0F81BAB64D53B288"/>
intended the Deſtruction of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſoberly think the Author errs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the other Hand, elſe he would never took ſo much Pains to make a bad Thing good, and try to patch it up, ſo as to make it ſtand. It appears to me his principal Aim and Deſign was not to altar Nothing in the Conſtitution, excepting to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Horns that the Clergy has placed upon their Heads, to puſh all the diſeaſed of the Flock, Ezek. 34.21. Alſo, leaſt they ſhould grow ſo ſturdy and ſtrong as to puſh the civil Authority too, as thoſe in their Cloth, in former Ages, have done. Therefore, ſo far as the Author has vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the free Liberties of the Churches and People of God, I am willing, from my Heart, that all due Honor ſhould be conferr'd upon him. But is to Mr. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barts' Writings, they diſcover to me that he ſtands in the very Spirit and Breath of what the Articles of Diſcipline hold forth, in the ſtrongeſt Manner; which I believe was the very Deſign of thoſe that eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Plan, and that he chooſes to wear the Horns, becauſe they add to his Power and Dignity. And indeed, if his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or thoſe that like the Plan, can find out a Way to keep the Horns from hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Neighbours, they may wear them
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:010621_0090_0F81BAB8D9BB0558"/>
as long as they like. But from the Spirit that too much governs in theſe Perſons, I am jealous that they will not be kept from doing Miſchief. Therefore, upon the Whole, I believe it is beſt for the civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to break them off timely, leaſt they are hurt by them. Yet, notwithſtanding my Opinion of Mr. Hobart, in this Caſe, I am willing to refer my Reader to what he has wrote in his Reply to the Author's Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation; ſhewing that he has entirely miſſed the Deſign of the Eſtabliſhers of Saybrook Plan: Connecting of it with what I have briefly obſerved, ſerves my preſent Deſign, ſo that I can calmly ſet it aſide, and go forward, to take into ſerious Conſideration, Mr. Hobart's Vindication of the ſame Plan.</p>
            <p>The Reader may obſerve, that when I ſhall have Occaſion further to note any Thing from the Explanation of the Plat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, I ſhall uſe the ſame Diſtinction that I have already done, ſaying the Author, &amp;c. and when I am replying, or remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Mr. Hobart's Book, I ſhall ſay, the Writer, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The firſt Thing that I ſhall take Notice of in Mr. Hobart's Book, is in P. 5. where he is remarking upon the congregational Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that, the Author would eſtabliſh.
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:010621_0091_0F81BAB9AD26F1D8"/>
There, I think, he does not treat Things fairly, but uſes Craft and Guile, intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the congregational Government was what the Articles of the Saybrook Plan holds forth, viz. that it belongs to the Conſociation, and not the Brotherhood, to determine, and finally judge all eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Matters; and that the Diſcipline that the Author pleads for, which our god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Forefathers held, is the Browniſt's Scheme. This may ſtartle ſome ungrounded Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſo make Proſelytes to his Scheme, and all through an unjuſt Repreſentation of the Matter. I underſtand the Diſtinction thus; Congregationaliſts a Sect of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendants, between Preſbyterians and Brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts, &amp;c. What is the Preſbyterian Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? By the Church's Officers, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor and Lay-Elders, excluding the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood. What is the Browniſt's Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? Anſwer. As I underſtand them, they hold the Power, in every Reſpect, in the Brotherhood, and are ſo rigid, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny all ſiſter Relation to any Church under Heaven; not allowing their Elders to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter but of the Church that they have the Charge of; denying Councils of Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, &amp;c. The Congregationaliſts are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them in this Reſpect; they hold, that all Power is in the Brotherhood alſo.
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:010621_0092_0F81BABA5AD8A670"/>
But then they hold a Siſter-Relation with other Churches, in the ſame Profeſſion; a Communion together in each other's Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Gifts; and, when there is Need, a Council of Churches, to give Counſel and Advice, in any difficult Caſe, and no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. What then is the Plan the Writer is labouring to eſtabliſh? Anſ. I underſtand it thus: The Paſtor of a Church has Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to negative the whole Church, and then to take the Caſe out of the Church, and carry it to the Conſociation; and the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren have no more to do in the Caſe, but to be finally iſſued in the Council. But who are the Actors in the Council? Why the Clergy only. Indeed there is Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers there, but they are only as ſo many Cyphers, except it be to wait upon their Paſtors. Thus ſtands the Caſe: And I think this Plan robs the Church of their Right, as much, if not more, than the Preſbyterian Order: for they allow the Laity to act in their Diſcipline, but this allows none but Clergymen to make their deciſive Judgment. And yet the Writer would fain inſinuate into his Reader's Mind, that the Plan he is a pleading for, is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational, when, in Fact, it is as far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote as the Preſbyterian, if not, in ſome Reſpects, farther. It is nothing to the
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:010621_0093_0F81BABACC560138"/>
Writer's Purpoſe to ſay, that the Council is a Conſociation of Churches, becauſe the Meſſenger, or Laity, are excluded from Power of Action, in theſe deciſive Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, as I ſhall ſhow in its Place.</p>
            <p>Again, in this 5th Page, the Writer ſaith,
<q>The Churches of Connecticut had, for more than half a Century, made Trial of that looſe Form of Government &amp; Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which this Writer (meaning the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the Explanation) would now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to us, &amp; they found by ſad Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it was impoſſible to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Purity, good Order and Peace, on that Plan.</q>
But I would hope the Writer will not be offended, if we ſuſpend the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of this Aſſertion till ſome proper Proof is produced to make it evident. For it is well known by all that was acquainted with the Churches under that looſe Government (as he is pleaſed to call it) and that know theſe Times, that the Caſe, in Fact, is quite the Reverſe: The Churches was much more pure and peaceable then, beyond what they be now. I could produce a Multitude of Facts to make this evident, were it needful; but rather than ſwell my Book, I chooſe to refer my Reader to the Hon. Roger Woolcott, late Governor of this Colony, in a Letter he wrote to Mr.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:010621_0094_0F81BAC0DD612DE0"/>
Hobart, the Writer, upon this very Point; which Letter I earneſtly recommend to the Peruſal of all, for I think it ought to be taken Notice of in Honor to his Memory; that in ſuch an advanced Age that he had arrived to, when he wrote that Letter, he ſhould give ſuch a clear Witneſs to the Truth, againſt the Tyranny that the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is labouring to have continued over the Churches.</p>
            <p>Again, the Writer, ſhewing the Cauſe why theſe Articles now in Debate, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced, ſaith,
<q>The leading Men, both in Church and State, ſaw and lamented the Confuſions they were brought into,</q>
&amp;c. This is doubtleſs true; and I am quite willing that the Writer ſhould take all the Advantage and Honor that ariſes therefrom, to himſelf; only I would note upon it, that proud, ambitious Men, being croſſed in their aſpiring Deſigns, are uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flung into Confuſion and Perplexity; Witneſs proud Haman, &amp;c. Now the Diſcipline then, in being in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, ſerved to check and curb ſuch aſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Minds. But I will venture to ſay, and likely in as much truth, as the Writer, and in more Propriety, that the good Men in that Day, yea, the truly godly, and moſt ſpiritual, was in Diſtreſs, and great
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:010621_0095_0F81BAC2B84FCD50"/>
Concern for the Churches: Witneſs Mr. Mather's Writings, Mr. Wiſe, and Others. Diſcourſing in the leading Men, both in Church and State (which my Antagoniſt meant) an aſpiring Spirit, to rob the Church of her richeſt Treaſure, and ſo bring her into Slavery; which, in Fact, is awfully brought to paſs, in this religious Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution (which I am labouring to uncover, and hold up in View of the rational Mind.) For ſee how is the Churches Prieſt-ridden, in many Places. When there is any Thing to be tranſacted, the Miniſter leads for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, which is his proper Work; but then he propoſes and draws up the Reſult, and finally iſſues the Caſe, all in and from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (of what is acted in the Church.) And where is the Church? Why they ſet (not as the Spouſe of Chriſt, that has ſworn to exerciſe herſelf, with all the Powers of Mind, and the Members of her Body, to ſhew her chaſt Love and Loyalty to her exalted Head and Huſband, 1 Cor. 6.20.) but as a Company of Underlings or Slaves, almoſt afraid to ſay that their Souls are their own, with their Tongue within their Teeth, and their Hands uſeleſs, and Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence does all on the Church's Part, and the Seats they ſit upon does juſt as much. And if it ſhould ſo happen, that a Brother
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:010621_0096_0F81BAC322FC1DA0"/>
ſhould ſpeak contrary to the Motion made; ſilence is required, and the poor Slave ſhuts up his Mouth, and down he ſets, uneaſy within, &amp;c. Here in ſhort I think, is the true State of the Caſe in ſome Churches. I muſt intreat my Reader not to be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me for ſetting Things in their own Light—but view it well, and ſee if it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports with the Scripture Character of the Church of Jeſus Chriſt. But I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my deſigned Buſineſs, and leave thoſe Outworks, ſince their Strength is taken away; and encamp againſt the ſtrong Hold, and caſt up a Bank, and mount the Cannons of eternal Truth, and point them at the Spot where to make a Breach, for an Overthrow, and through the Divine Grace aſſiſting, and Wiſdom from above, I hope for Succeſs to accompliſh my deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed End, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To come to the Caſe in Hand. The Writer has laid down four Propoſitions, as a Foundation to eſtabliſh his Building up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I mean not to take them in their Courſe to reply to, for that will make my Piece too long. I ſhall endeavour to take a ſhorter Method, and purpoſe firſt to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge my Artillery, and forthwith ſtorm the Fort, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To proceed. The Writer has undertook
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:010621_0097_0F81BAC3D35003F8"/>
to prove, that there is two Churches in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, one inferior, the other ſuperior; the inferior Church is a ſmall Body of Chriſtians, congregated together to worſhip God in private Houſes, and alſo may exerciſe ſome Diſcipline, but not to determine the Caſe finally; but to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the ſuperior Church, which is, as he ſaith, a Conſociation of Churches, made out of theſe ſmall Churches: Which ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Church is to hear all Cauſes eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, judge and finally determine the ſame. Alſo that theſe two diſtinct Bodies are known in the Scripture by one Name; the Church in the ſingle Tenſe. Hence the Writer in his Way and Manner, with a great Deal of Craft and Sophiſtry, preſumes to make out the Being of theſe two Churches, from the Scriptures, &amp;c. I obſerve as to the Word Church, being verſed in Scripture, to denote two Bodies, I readily grant; but not in the Senſe the Writer means, that I utterly deny; neither has he brought a Scrap of Proof, but what he has ſpun out of his own Bowels, to make out his Scheme. Search the Scriptures, and you may find, the Word Church, is uſed to deſcribe a ſingle Congregation of Saints, be they more or leſs, covenanted together to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Worſhip and Diſcipline of Chriſt's
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:010621_0098_0F81BAC48ADB2CC0"/>
Houſe: ſee 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, 23. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5, 4, 5. Alſo to deſcribe all the churches of Chriſt, throughout Chriſtendom, as one church, which he has bought with his own Blood: ſee <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. But not one Text, I preſume, can be found in the Bible to prove the church the Writer would fain eſtabliſh. But his church is a Tribunal he has erected in his Imagination contrary to the Scriptures, adding thereto. Therefore the Writer may read his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, Rev. 22.18.</p>
            <p>Now according to my Purpoſe, I ſhall ſtorm this Fort, and enter at the Gap the Writer has left. See Page 30. "There are ſome Texts which repreſent the church as having the Power of Diſcipline; when yet it cannot be certainly determined from any Thing in the context in what Senſe the Word Church is uſed. The Deſign of theſe Texts may be to repreſent the church in each of theſe ſenſes we have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of it, as veſted with this Power, of this ſort, I ſhall at preſent mention but one, Mat. 18.17. <hi>Tell it to the Church. But if he neglect to hear the Church let him be unto thee as an Heathen Man and a Publican.</hi> Here the Word ſeems uſed in a general ſenſe to denote any Society that Chriſt ſhould afterward erect and dignify with
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:010621_0099_0F81B9FDCF3F2AF0"/>
that Name, &amp;c." Here Reader, allow me to uſe Plainneſs for my Heart is fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with Pain in diſcovering what craft and ſophiſtry the Writer uſes, to ſhun the Truth and to eſtabliſh his darling Scheme; for if you mind, he would fain inſinuate into his Readers Mind, that this Text is ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that it is difficult to tell from the context the true Meaning; only as it may be taken to eſtabliſh both the churches his ſcheme has made; when in Truth there is nothing more familiar, plain and explicit, than this Text, and context, expreſſive of Chriſt's Mind and Will to his Church, as one individual Body, congregated to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to attend upon the Laws he has or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be carefully obſerved, for the Health, Unity, and Preſervation of the Body. Pray obſerve how plain and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Chriſt's Directions are, reſpecting the Rule of Duty in the Government of his church, both in the firſt, ſecond, and third Step, and fixes the laſt Judgment in the church, ſaying, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you</hi> (but what you? a Number of conſociated churches, with their miniſters in council: No, no, the Text knows nothing about ſuch a church, but you Brethren that have ſolemnly covenanted to walk together in all the Laws and Ordinances of my Houſe) <hi>whatſoever ye ſhall bind on Earth,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:010621_0100_0F81BA01A59A4050"/>
ſhall be bound in Heaven.</hi> Thus Jeſus Chriſt who is the Wiſdom of God, has fixed the Government of his church, the final ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt the Offender to be given by the church, one individual Body of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore if I may be allowed in Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to uſe ſcripture Language, I ſhall ſay, the Fox has croſſed his Track, and got catched in the Trap of impregnable Truth, and will be held faſt. For as a Fox that ſmells a Trap is affraid of being catched therein, ſteps with Fear; but ere he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, ſteps his Foot right in the Trap, and is catched. Thus the writer had got to a critical Spot, and would fain have paſſed it, but has ſtepped right into it, and Truth has caught him. For in the Paſſage laſt cited, he goes on and ſaith, "And as it is evident that particular worſhipping Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, are called churches in ſcripture; it includes them; nay, ſince theſe are the churches which private chriſtians are moſt acquainted with, and can with the greateſt Eaſe apply to, it may be allowed, that the Direction primarily intends ſuch churches." Thus Reader, you may ſee, the Writer is come to a final cloſe with his new formed church, erected in ſuch ſuperiority and ſovereign Power, over the church of Chriſt,

for he here confeſſes that Chriſt primarily intended to commit this power of binding and looſing to a ſingle church, then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the writer muſt own, that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt never intended to contradict him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and place a church with ſuperior power (over this that he has put the laſt ſentence, and that by his decree) ſo as to revoke the ſentence thus paſſed. Thus I think that the writers whole ſcheme is fap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the roots; or to repeat a military figure that I have uſed, the caſtle is ſtorm'd and taken. But if the writer ſhould be fond of this new formed church, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what has been ſaid, I think he muſt know that it has loſt its grandeur and power. For let the number, be more or leſs conſociated together in council, they are obliged by the writer's own confeſſion to knuckle, and come down &amp; fall in the rear, and have their works tried by the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual churches that they reſpectively belong to; becauſe Jeſus Chriſt has inveſted every church with power to deal with their own members, and to paſs the final ſentence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the tranſgreſſor.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. In order for the writer's making out this ſuperior church, I think it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to prove from the ſcriptures by ſome certain facts, that thoſe ſmall churches that
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:010621_0102_0F81BA03193BABC8"/>
meet in private houſes, exerciſed ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline among themſelves, as he ſaith. But not any diſcipline I preſume can be found was ever exerciſed in them houſes, ſaluted as churches. The writer has ſhewn none. I have ſearched every paſſage he has cited, and find nothing of that nature—but the ſcriptures are free for every one to ſearch; therefore I adviſe my reader to ſearch care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, to know for yourſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. I think it is neceſſary alſo for him to ſhew that there is ſuch a church inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by Chriſt, ſuperior to the other inveſted with power to paſs a final ſentence, &amp;c. The texts the writer has bro't proves no ſuch a church as he would; and before I can fall in with that opinion, I muſt find from ſcripture record, when theſe ſmall churches meet, the time and place to form this council, a church over themſelves, in ſuperiority, and who was athoriſed to ſend out the letters miſſive, and who was the meſſenger to carry the ſame, and when met what cauſes they tried, and what their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence was, &amp;c. For if we muſt be informed about Paul's cloak, and no record of ſuch a grand council, inveſted with power from Chriſt, to tranſact the moſt important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs that reſpects Chriſt's viſible kingdom here on earth. This is too unaccountable for me to believe as yet!</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="106" facs="unknown:010621_0103_0F81BA03F3F59320"/>4thly. The writer to make out his two churches, is obliged to do it by conjectures, ſuppoſitions, &amp;c. Hence from this ſandy bottom he ſhews their being ſo many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts in Jeruſalem, and a time of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they was obliged to meet in ſmall bodies in private houſes (which was the inferior churches) and to tranſact their weighty affairs to meet in a conſociation of theſe ſmall churches, to make one ſuperior church, and if ſo, altho' the perſecution had been very hot, they could with pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence make it out pretty well. For this grand church could get into a pretty ſmall place, a great deal leſs than thoſe ſmall churches could meet in; for he allows they may contain two or three hundred, and the churches ſuppoſed to be ſeven; and ſeven churches to ſend their paſtor and two meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers makes but 21, there is no more wanting, but the complainer and offender with their evidence, which added to the council, probably would not make out more than 30, and it is quite likely that a poor man's houſe would do for them. But I think the writer has made a miſs in his conjectures, and ſince his whole building ſtands upon ſuch a bottom, I think it would have ſhown his cunning, to let his thoughts have penetrated a little further, to ſee how
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:010621_0104_0F81BA0493D262F8"/>
his conjectures would meet in the cloſe, and not betrayed his weekneſs. For ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, he allows theſe inferior churches to be about ſeven, and to contain about three hundred at the moſt, to make one aſſembly; which makes 2100; and it is certain that there was only one ſingle body congregated together for divine and public worſhip, out of which 3000 was converted, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41, 46. <hi>Continuing with one accord in the temple</hi>— But the writer conjectures, that they met in that day, in a private, or a poor man's houſe. Now it matters not where they meet, ſince they was together in one place, not conſociated by delegation; and if I may be allowed to conjecture, as well as the writer, I ſhould think it poſſible, if not probable, that a third, if not half of theſe ſeven aſſemblies was not church members, and deduct but a third out, and there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains 1400. Again, on the other hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I may reaſonably conclude, that that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly contained ſome thouſands beſides what was converted, for there was many that mocked, and doubtleſs many that was a ſort of neuters, and many that was under ſome convictions, and not converted; all which is common in a great aſſembly, where the power of God is diſplayed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt a mixed multitude. But be this as it will, 3000 and more was certainly
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:010621_0105_0F81BA054D948448"/>
convened in one ſpot for divine worſhip. Therefore putting all together, the writer's own conjecture of the ſum total of thoſe ſmall churches makes but 2100. So that here is room enough left for the church to grow a great deal, and tranſact all her affairs, and no neceſſity of a conſociation of churches, &amp;c. But as to theſe ſmall churches in private houſes, I rather think there the ſaints meet at times in chriſtian conferences, and for ſocial worſhip, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the church aſſembled together in a place, and not the whole church. So that part is called the church; for, elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where the ſcripture ſpeaks of the whole church meeting together, <hi>Acts</hi> 15, 22, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14, 23. Which was to judge and tranſact weighty matters. But in theſe houſes, ſaluted as a church, doubtleſs there was ſocial worſhip attended that did not need the whole church, &amp;c. But if I am miſtaken in this matter, it makes not one way nor the other, inaſmuch as there is clear facts in ſcripture, that particular churches was inveſted with power by Jeſus Chriſt their head, to deal with their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly members and proceed to paſs the laſt ſentence of rejection, &amp;c. Did I like the buſineſs, I could eaſily follow the writer in every part of his performance, and diſcover his craft, and take off the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:010621_0106_0F81BA06C6E194D8"/>
falſe gloſs he has caſt over it; but I chooſe to leave it to thoſe that like the buſineſs better than I do. And only add, two paſſages of ſcripture, to that in the 18th of Mat. which I humbly conceive is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to confront all gainſayers whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſee 1 Cor. 5, notwithſtanding the writers vain and fruitleſs conjectures upon this chap. that this was a conſociated church, the chapter is able to ſpeak for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Obſerve Paul's ſalutation unto the church of God, which is at Corinth, called to be ſaints, chap. 1.2. Note here, not called to office or to be officers, no, but ſaints, which means a church made up of brethern, and that this church is a number of brethern in covenant bonds to God and each other (and not a claſſical church) is evident by the three laſt verſes of the 5th chapt. where Paul directs how one brother ſhall deal with another; perfectly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Chriſt's direction in the 18th of Mat. Alſo ſhews the diſtinction between a brother in covenant, and one that is not. There cannot be a church proceſs againſt a perſon that is not a member, but thoſe that are in covenant, and the ſcandalous, the brethern are obliged from Chriſt's and Paul's direction, to follow, till repentance or an excluſion from the church. That
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:010621_0107_0F81BA06D4EC27C8"/>
this church was not a conſociated church, is further evident in the 12th chap. in the which Paul gives deſcription of the church as a natural body, conſiſting of many members, and in the deſcription he takes in the female, as well as the male, as may be ſeen in the foregoing chap. and chap. 14.34. Now how the writer will do with the females in his council, is for him to ſay. Again, obſerve the 14th chap. 23. the apoſtle ſpeaks of the whole church meeting together for ſocial worſhip; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it confirms the point that the church of Corinth was but one body, altho' they might meet in ſmall companies in private houſes for ſome conveniency at times; yet they all come together in one place to make one whole body, &amp;c. 2dly. Rev. 2.2. Here we have certain facts aſſerted, a perſon tried by the church, the facts charged made out. But the writer ſaith, this is a conſociated church; and where comes his evidence? why, there is nothing appears, but that it came from the ſame ſource, as all the reſt, ſpun out of his own imagination. For obſerve Chriſt's ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the church. <hi>Unto the angel of the church,</hi> &amp;c. not to the angels of the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, met together, a conſociated church: No, mind Chriſt's charge againſt the church,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:010621_0108_0F81BA0798D91D50"/>
               <hi>Nevertheleſs I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love.</hi> Note— <hi>againſt thee.</hi> Therefore ſeeing what was amiſs, he addreſſes them as a ſingle church; not as churches, or a church of elders: no, nothing of this in the bible. Therefore to cloſe all my remarks upon the writers high church above the church. For to ſuppoſe that it is in the power of one church or more to make another, and that ſuperior to itſelf, or them, I ſoberly think it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the word of God, to ſound or right reaſon, and the very law of nature. Therefore properly ſpeaking it is jargon— I dont underſtand it—and the clergyman that has formed it, may ſhare all the glory of it to himſelf. And may the Lord God Almighty, have mercy upon him, and acquaint him with Jeſus Chriſt and the character he has given of his Dear Spouſe, bought with his blood; and alſo what is required of the man that Chriſt has quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to be a ſervant to his church. So I diſmiſs the writer.</p>
            <p>Having removed theſe two pieces, or blocks out of my way, I ſhall return to the chambers of imagery, for further ſearch, and ſo take notice of a few things there, and then diſmiſs the ſearch. Therefore, what remains for me to conſider, is to make
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:010621_0109_0F81BA0C8DCB4BB8"/>
ſome ſhort remarks upon the articles of diſcipline, formed for a rule of practice in the latter end of Saybrook confeſſion or plan. Here I would firſt refer the reader to what I have already wrote upon theſe articles in my book, printed in the year 1750; in which performance I have examined all the ſcriptures brought to ſupport theſe 15 articles, and ſhewn that they have no foundation from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; but are founded upon the ſands of men's inventions; and there I have leſt them for the rain and wind of divine truth to beat upon for their overthrow in due time. Therefore to add ſomewhat thereto in this performance. I ſhall firſt take notice of the 14th article, page 115. "That the ſaid aſſociated paſtors, ſhall alſo be conſulted by bereaved churches, belonging to their aſſociation, and recommend to ſuch churches, ſuch perſons as may be fit to be called and ſettled in the work of the goſpel miniſtry among them. And if ſuch bereaved churches ſhall not ſeaſonably call and ſettle a miniſter among them, the ſaid aſſociated paſtors ſhall lay the ſtate of ſuch bereaved churches before the general aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of this colony, that they may take ſuch orders concerning them, as ſhall be found neceſſary for their peace and edification."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:010621_0110_0F81BA0D4D242E78"/>I ſhall conſider the two meaſures this article propoſes for a bereaved church to get or have a miniſter.</p>
            <p>Firſt, a bereaved church is obliged to go to this council for a miniſter, be the caſe how it will; if the bigger part of the council ſhould be enemies to the power of godlineſs, it makes no odds with this plan, or if the church, has the knowledge of one qualified according to the goſpel, and the council does nor ſee fit to adviſe to him, it is all up with the church, as to that man; and then they muſt be at the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation's direction, to go from Dan to Berſheba, or place to place, and ride poſt a great while perhaps, and be at great expence—and at length they get a man upon trial, which ſhews himſelf by his converſation and public performance as ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of any ſaving knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt, and his ſpirit's work upon the hearts of men, as when he was born: yea, upon cloſe converſation with him, a meer enemy to the power of godlineſs. But to be ſhort, the church muſt be under the council's thumb, the man they ſay, or none. Here the church is ſtript of her ſacred and moſt valuable right. For altho' this article ſeems to have a friendly look, and concern for the bereaved church, and ſeems to offer
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:010621_0111_0F81BA0D98365570"/>
help by way of advice. Yet this viſage is taken off by and by; for if the poor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved church, to keep a chaſte conſcience is obliged to refuſe the men directed to by the council; then this council in their friendly pretence of concern for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved church, acquaints the general aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly with their caſe. But why the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral aſſembly? they are a civil court, God's miniſters in the civil kingdom. No matter for that, ſays this plan, we have not the civil ſword, nor power to force our mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters upon the churches; therefore we want their help to effect our deſigns. The aſſembly can ſhift places as they pleaſe, and ſet half a day as God's miniſters, for our good in the civil kingdom, and the other half conſtitute themſelves a ſpiritual court, and carry all our deſigns thro' &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Therefore ſecondly, the general aſſembly becoming a ſpiritual body, can ſay who ſhall be a church of Chriſt, and who not; where men ſhall worſhip God, and where not; who ſhall preach the goſpel, and who not; and order concerning a bereaved church, as ſhall be, for their peace and edification, ſaith the article. Well, but how doth the general aſſembly order for their peace and edification? Anſwer, you may ſee in the other part of the plan,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:010621_0112_0F81BA0E4F900628"/>
that ſtands connected with this. C. L. B. page 166 and 167. There ſhall be ſuch ſums of money raiſed, as the aſſembly ſhall appoint, and be committed to the county court, to hire a man, and thruſt him upon the ſociety and church, altho' the church be never ſo oppoſite thereto. And ſuch miniſters have their character drawn by infinite wiſdom, John 10, 1.10.—<hi>The ſame is a thief and a robber—the thief cometh not but for to ſteal and to kill, and to deſtroy.</hi> Now reader, when man in the right exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his reaſon, can think that this plan is for the peace and edification of the church, to be thus tyrannized over, except he be in the papiſt principles? But that my dear neighbours may ſee themſelves, I muſt turn them to ſee the flat contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is in their plan. See confeſſion of faith, page 65. "God alone is Lord of the conſcience, and hath left it free from the doctrines and commandments of men: ſo that to believe ſuch doctrines or to obey ſuch commands out of conſcience, is to betray true liberty of conſcience." page 66. "But the acceptable way of worſhipping the true God, is inſtituted by himſelf, and ſo limitted by his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, that he may not be worſhipped according to the imaginations and devices
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:010621_0113_0F81BA0F10674F70"/>
of men, &amp;c." Here I would obſerve to thoſe that are zealous for the conſtitution, and take offence at my writing. In theſe paſſages is contained the whole of all that I would be after, and contending earneſtly for, with miniſters and rulers. Indeed theſe lines now cited out of your articles are worthy to be written in letters of gold. But how extremely contrary hereto is all our eccleſiaſtical laws? and how flat is the contradiction between theſe articles of faith, and your practice in forming ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and churches ſettling and ſupporting miniſters? I will venture to ſay, it will puzzel and out-do the wiſdom of a <hi>Solomon</hi> to reconcile the ſeveral parts of your plan, and make it conſiſtent with itſelf, or the word of God. I ſuppoſe the author to the explanation of Saybrook plan, thought he had done the buſineſs. But how came he to paſs by in total ſilence all the eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal laws? Who but himſelf can tell? I am ready to gueſs that if he glanced his mind upon them laws, he knew it was beyond him or an angel, to reconcile them with thoſe articles, which he took to raiſe his ſuperſtructure upon, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Secondly, I ſhall take ſome notice of the 12th article which is but a branch of the ſame corrupt tree, a little nearer the root.
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:010621_0114_0F81BA0FCEB2E8B0"/>
See the laſt clauſe of the article, "Who alſo ſhall have power of examining and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending the candidates of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to the work thereof, &amp;c. But what is the examination? Likely in general, what proficiency they have made in their learning—what knowledge in logic, or in geography, or in head divinity, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remote from the thing. Not are you converted—give a narrative of your experience—let us know upon what you found your hope—what have you experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced under the law work—what manifeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations have you had of the way or life by Jeſus Chriſt—or what knowledge have you got of the Holy Spirit's work upon the hearts of the godly, in its different ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations—alſo, what acquaintance with the miſtery of iniquity's working—ſatan in his angelic light, to enſnare ſouls—or do you know of the ſcripture qualifications for church memberſhip, and the qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for her officers—how the church is built—what are her ordinances, and how ſhe is governed, &amp;c. Now, if I have been informed right, there is nothing of this nature paſſes in the examination of a candidate for the miniſtry, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed once, that a godly meſſenger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded the queſtion to a young candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:010621_0115_0F81BA112D3B8B48"/>
whether he was converted or not, and he replied, to the godly father, it is none of your buſineſs, and ſo it ended, I have been informed, that ſome of theſe councils ſay, that they have no buſineſs to examine theſe candidates, whether they be converted or not; that would offer an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to ſuch a young gentleman, to aſk ſuch a queſtion: And indeed viewing their appearance, temper and frame of ſpirit they diſcover, it looks likely to me, to be ſo. Now, if it ſhould be ſo in fact, then the main and principal thing that ſhews a man to have the eſſential qualifications for the miniſtry, muſt not be ſought after. Wherefore I think it is high time for the churches in this colony to wake up to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, &amp; reaſſume their juſt rights and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, and take it out of the hands of the clergy, who now reign as Lords over them, as this article teſtifies, by which the church is robbed of every miniſter, but what they ſee fit to licence.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I muſt come to the center where they form their tribunal, in order to make the ſupreme court, that, ſhall paſs the final ſentence upon the tranſgreſſor; ſee page 111, "that according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon practice of our churches, no thing ſhall be deemed an act or judgment of any
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:010621_0116_0F81BA11A352C920"/>
council, which hath not the major part of the elders preſent concurring, and ſuch a number of the meſſengers preſent, as make the majority of the council. &amp;c. Obſerve the craft and falacy that is uſed to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this article, as tho' it had been the common and ſtated practice of the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, to be governed by the major vote of the elders or clergy: when in fact, it was repugnant to their principles and practice, which Cambridge platform ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. But however, it would ſerve to blind the eyes of thoſe, that are willingly blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and appear with that face as tho' that wiſe and reverend council, was not a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to impoſe any thing new upon them; till in fact, the halter was ſlipped over the churches neck, and the miniſters hold the end of it to this day. There is here and there one, that is partly waked up to feel that the halter hurts them, and they complain about it, but all to no purpoſe, ſeeing they like the conſtitution, they muſt bear the gall of the halter as well as they can. To return, obſerve the article fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the government in the major part of the elders preſent concurring. What propriety then can there be in ſaying any thing about the meſſengers more or leſs, for the court is already conſtituted with all its members,
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:010621_0117_0F81BA1267E48A28"/>
that is inveſted with power to give the final ſentence, as the next article ſhews? but I could not but ſmile in my ſelf, when I was reading the author of the explanation of this plan, when he came to this article; I thought that notwithſtanding all his ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior abilities, here he got graveled, to make out his congregational plan the chain got broke, and he could not join it toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther only by ſome queries, finally leaving it to others to conſider and determine &amp;c. Indeed it appears to me, that the compilers of theſe articles intended to exclude the brethren intirely out of the government of the church or council; for obſerve, how indifferently and ſlitely they treat the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers from time to time, in theſe articles. Obſerve this article, "provided that if any ſuch church, ſhall not ſee cauſe to ſend any meſſengers to the council, or the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons choſen by them ſhall not attend, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe ſhall be any obſtruction &amp;c." So alſo in the foregoing article, ſpeaking of the church ſaith, "if they ſee cauſe to ſend meſſengers." Again, in the tenth article, ſhewing how much the council ſhall be formed to act in their high digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſay, "and notify the ſaid time and place to the elders and churches of that county, who ſhall attend at the ſame, the elders,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:010621_0118_0F81BA12CBE1C368"/>
in their own perſons, and the churches by their meſſengers if they ſee cauſe to ſend them &amp;c." Here obſerve, the elders in their own perſons, this is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to conſtitute this high court, but the meſſengers not neceſſary; they may ſtay at home and welcome, except they are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to take a ride and ſo wait upon the elders, put out, and fetch up their horſes; cut tobacco, fetch a coal of fire, &amp;c. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, the article makes a diſtinct body, the elders by themſelves as if they ſtood in no relation to the churches; and then the churches by themſelves, and they ſtand for a cypher. Indeed I think it will puzzel a wiſe man to find out what the meſſenger's work is, if not ſomething as I have hinted. Take the 4th article which excludes meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers out of the queſtion, and let theſe paſſages now cited be connected with it, and I think it will make a ſober man ſmile to ſee how gravely they write in the 9th ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle; "That all the churches of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective conſociations ſhall chuſe if they ſee cauſe, one or two members of each church to repreſent them in the councils of the ſaid churches, as occaſion may call for them who ſhall ſtand in that capacity, till new be choſen for the ſame ſervice, unleſs &amp;c.
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:010621_0119_0F81BA166FC6E560"/>
mind this article—if they ſee cauſe—here to be ſure the churches ought to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that matters can be accommodated as well without them as with them; and as Gov. Wolcott well obſerves, in his letter, "The church's meſſengers are only as ſo many dead weights in the council" for the whole plan that is laid for government, in their articles, makes it a matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differency, whether there is any meſſengers or not; and if they go<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their vote weighs nothing; yet this article makes a great noiſe about chuſing and ſtanding in the ſame capacity, and for the ſame ſervice; and this is what I mean will make a ſober man ſmile (that when the meſſengers are excluded out of the queſtion) to tell about their ſervice: which I think will puzzel a wiſe man to find out what their ſervice is, except, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, and laſtly, I freely grant, that when a church is got any difficulty among themſelves, reſpecting doctrine, diſcipline, or any point that they want light in, it is ſcriptural and right for the church to call a council of ſuch as they think in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences is moſt likely to help them, let them live in what town, county or colony ſoever: and for a church to be limited to ſuch lines as this plan fixes, is an abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of their juſt rights, the ſcripture ſaith whether Paul, Apollos or Cephas, all are yours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3, 22. Further I grant, that when a church has dealt as they think in the rule of God's word, with a member or members, and the ſame perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons count themſelves wronged, they mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the church, for the favour to call a council out of the ſiſter churches, that the church would lay before ſaid council, their proceedings with the perſon or perſons that ſuppoſe they are wronged by the church, in order that the council may give their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; in ſuch caſe the church ought to comply with the motion, and when the council have heard the caſe on both ſides, then to give their advice, where they ſee it is wanting, whether to the church, or to the perſon or perſons dealt with, and what they ſee in the advice according to the ſcriptures, chearfully to comply with, and ſubject to, and no more; never to give up their own judgment for men nor Angels. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. Every church or ſingle perſon ſtanding right are willing to have their works tried, for they know that they are imperfect, and wherein they miſtake, they are willing to know it, and what they hold according to truth will bear trial, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the ſame, &amp;c. But ſuppoſing the
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:010621_0121_0F81BA17541B2BC8"/>
church has actually done wrong to theſe perſons, and refuſe to grant them their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of a council, in ſuch a caſe, the agreiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons have no right to call a council to ſummons the church to their bar for trial, as the conſtitution do, claiming a right to try paſtors and churches, and to paſs the final ſentence. No, it is my fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principle as I underſtand Chriſt in the 18th of Mat. that there is no eccleſiaſtical power or court above a church of Chriſt, or to ſummons a church of Chriſt to anſwer to, under the whole heavens. But in ſuch a caſe the proper ſtep for the agrieved perſon to take, is to make appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the next ſiſter church he thinks is able to help in the caſe; and that church he applies to, for the ſiſter relation, in a tender concern for the cauſe of Chriſt, and the ſacred rights of every Sheep of Chriſt's fold, ought to enquire of this church, what the perſon they have dealt with has done; and ſo aſk the favour of letting them have a hearing of the caſe, in order to give advice for healing: but if the church ſtill refuſes to let their works be tried as Chriſt directs, <hi>John</hi> 3, 20, 21, after due patience and all proper meaſures are taken to have a proper hearing, and the church ſtill obſtinately refuſing, then the church that has been uſing proper means to
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:010621_0122_0F81BA180D055408"/>
retain the ſiſter relation, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves chaſte to their only Lord and maſter, and not to ſuffer ſin to be co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over, have a juſt right to withdraw the hand of holy fellowſhip from ſuch a church, and ſo leave the church that, refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to have their works tried, to ſtand or fall to their own maſter, and no uſurpation in all the affair; for every church is, or ſhould be a free body, and have a right to act as they think is moſt pleaſing to Chriſt their only head, without being controuled by any eccleſiaſtical power whatſoever; and as the church acted freely in giving the right hand of fellowſhip, ſo alſo the caſe requiring, they have an equal right to withdraw their hand of fellowſhip; and in caſe the agrieved perſon or perſons are found innocent, the church that has with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn the hand of fellowſhip, ſhould take them into fellowſhip, and give them their place in Chriſt's fold. Thus I think ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this nature is neceſſary to preſerve the rights of conſcience, and the ſiſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of churches in the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>To return to the articles, and ſay by a figure, how would a godly perſon be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed that was well acquainted with the affairs of Chriſt's viſible kingdom, coming
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:010621_0123_0F81BA18D46DA510"/>
from far to this colony, ſeeing a people favoured with the free uſe of ſearching the ſcriptures, which are perfect, and give plain and familiar directions, how they ſhould walk with God, and one another, compoſing theſe 15 articles, in Saybrook plan, and decreeing them to be the rule of practice in the affairs of Chriſt's kingdom or to govern the church of Chriſt by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Surely he would think that they criminally &amp; ſhamefully neglected a due and proper regard to Chriſt's direction, John 5.39. <hi>Search the ſcriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which teſtify of me.</hi> Note, here the ſcriptures not only teſtify that Chriſt is the end of the law for righteouſneſs to them that believe in him; but alſo they teſtify of Chriſt, in holding forth his mind and will in all practical godlineſs, and viſible obedience in all the affairs of his moral and divine kingdom here on earth. Therefore, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe articles forming ſo many different bodies in degrees of divinity one above another, it muſt be ſhocking to a ſober mind that knows Chriſt has formed but one, viz. the church, and further to conſider how many meetings there is ſtated at different places and times in a year, with a ſhew of buſineſs of great importance to be done by
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:010621_0124_0F81BA1991632048"/>
them, as if the ſcriptures was very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and did not reach the churches caſe in all things, (it is true that they do not reach their caſe:) Therefore it is neceſſary for them to preſcribe rules that ſhould ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the defect; ſo that putting the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and their preſcriptions together, the church will have a compleat plan to walk by. See article 10, page 114. "And all councils may preſcribe rules as occaſion may require; and whatſoever they ſhall judge needful, within their circuit, for the well performing and orderly managing the ſeveral acts to be attended by them, or matters that come under their cogniſance, &amp;c." I muſt think for an article to be found, the compilers of it muſt be able to ſay, thus and thus, we find written in the word of God is our direction, &amp;c. But I muſt confeſs it is beyond me to account for theſe new rules preſcribed any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than thus, That theſe bodies or coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils there ſpoken of, have no countenance or precedent from the ſcriptures: ſo no proviſion made for them in the word of God, which puts them to the neceſſity to preſcribe and enact rules and laws to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their own ends.—</p>
            <p>Again, I am obliged to think that it is a piece of poor policy, and no chriſtian
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:010621_0125_0F81BA1A4BA83120"/>
prudence exerciſed therein, to have ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny meetings of theſe councils, ſtated ſo often in a year; which cannot be attended without a great deal of precious time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken up about them, and a great expence that muſt come from ſome quarter or other in this difficult day; when at the ſame time, perhaps, there is no knowledge of any buſineſs to be done, unleſs they are ſtill wanting in rules to practice by.—My reaſon dictates to me a council convened together, always pre-ſuppoſes that there is matter of difficulties already commenced, and is prepared for hearing, in order to give counſel and advice, which is the only work that a council has to do. But if I underſtand this plan a-right, buſineſs or no buſineſs they muſt meet ſo often. Indeed I am ſlow of believing that theſe elders un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what is required of them in the ſolemn charge they have taken of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they are ſet over; for many of them hold that they have not time, neither is it their duty to viſit their flocks, unleſs they be ſick or ſent for; yet they can find time frequently to viſit ſome of the rich, where they can be ſumptuouſly entertained, and an agreeable converſation to them, which intirely excludes Godlineſs out of it.</p>
            <p>Again, altho' they cannot find time to
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:010621_0126_0F81BA1B0B4A7508"/>
viſit their flocks, yet, when it ſerves their intereſt, they can find time to keep ſchool, altho' there has been a legal bargain made, and they have (properly ſpeaking) let or hired themſelves out to the ſociety for ſo much a year, and perhaps at great wages too, four times as much as a common la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring man can get; and perhaps deceive the people, by reading other mens works, when the careleſs people thinks it is their own compoſing, &amp;c. take their ſettlement &amp; 2 or 3 years ſalary, and it is as much as common tradeſmen or labouring men get all their days. And altho' they have ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged to ſerve the ſociety with all their powers and abilities, in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, which includes all their time; yet they can break their ſolemn engagements, and rob the ſociety of their time, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſchool, or to merchandize and trade, or farm it, (ſome of them) almoſt as much as if they had not let themſelves out.—But I will venture to ſay, not a man in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety that hires his neighbour in his own buſineſs for a month or a year, will indulge him to go off in like manner to his own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, without deducting that time out of his wages. And good reaſon it ſhould be ſo, and that in the caſe of the miniſters bargain alſo.—But it is time to attend to
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:010621_0127_0F81BA1EF69D23E0"/>
what the word of God ſaith of miniſters in this matter; ſee Jerem. 23.1.2. Wo be unto the paſtors that deſtroy and ſcatter the ſheep of my paſture, ſaith the Lord. Therefore thus ſaith the Lord God of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael againſt the paſtors that feed my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ye have ſcattered my flock, and dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them away, and have not viſited them, behold I will viſit upon you the evil of your doings, ſaith the Lord. Obſerve—and have not viſited them.—Micah 3.5. &amp; 11. Thus ſaith the Lord, concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, peace, and he that putteth not into their mouth they even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare war againſt him.—The heads thereof judge for reward, and the prieſts thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money; yet will they lean upon the Lord and ſay, is not the Lord among us? none evil can come upon us. Ezek. 34.4. The diſeaſed have ye not ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, neither have ye healed that which was ſick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, neither have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye ſought that which was loſt; but with force and with cruelty have ye ruled them. Zecha. 11.17. Wo to the idol ſhepherds that leaveth the flock. Pleaſe
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:010621_0128_0F81BA2054C45C48"/>
to read theſe chapters out. Acts 20.28. Take heed therefore unto yourſelves, and to all the flock over the which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you overſeers, to feed the church of God which he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his own blood.—Mind reader —to all the flock—the poor as well as the rich &amp;c. Thus the Lord Jeſus requires miniſters to viſit all their flocks, and to know their ſtanding; but the body of the miniſters of this conſtitution, I think, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſay in word and practice, no Lord. You did not well conſider how large our flock was, nor how much time it would take to viſit them all; for if we ſtrictly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your direction, we ſhall not have time enough to recreate ourſelves, nor wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our good friends that come to ſee us, to have a little paſtime together. Further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, we ſhall be ſtraitened for time to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon our conſociations, that are of ſuch great importance; which meetings the ſcriptures was too ſhort in not making proviſion for them; yet by experience we find theſe meetings neceſſary to accompliſh our deſigns. It is a great advantage to us to leave our ſtudies, and to take our horſes and ride to theſe councils, for we are put to no trouble; we have our meſſengers to wait upon us, and all rare dainties provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:010621_0129_0F81BA2119103AB0"/>
for us at our meetings; and we find it for our health, and that it britens up our ſenſes to paſs a few civil jeſts and jokes; if we do tell ſome large ſtories, we do not mean to deceive or lie, but only jeſt; <note n="*" place="bottom">I was upon a ſpecial occaſion called to viſit one of theſe miniſters, and whilſt I was preſent, one of his Brethren in the miniſtry with two women, came in to ſee him, and one of the women aſked him where his wife was? (ſhe appeared to me to be full of vanity) he with as great air of carnality, replied in the kitchen: partly turning his body, and pointing with his hand to the kitchen; when at the ſame time the miniſter was a ſingle man, and the woman he made ſuit too, lived in another ſociety, ſome miles diſtant; and more of this carnal nature paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between them, and what made this inſtance more ſhocking and ſurprizing to me was, that in a few breaths before, he was reminded of his wickedneſs and high character, and how examplary he ought to live; may a merciful God pity ſuch carnal mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters that put on a ſabbath day countenance in the pulpit, as tho' they would teach ſouls the way to heaven, when in the week time, their carnal conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and practice tends to lead poor ſouls down to hell!</note> and when refreſhed with a few glaſſes of wine, we have weightier matters to conſult. Pray what be they? why to converſe free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among ourſelves, to know how much we ought to raiſe our ſalaries, and what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is proper to be made to them &amp;c.— My reader that is acquainted with theſe councils, will be beſt able to tell how near the conjectures come to the mark. But
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:010621_0130_0F81BA21D8111E18"/>
to return and ſay, if I have been wanting in making full proof that thoſe councils have no power of juriſdiction over the churches, I refer my reader to what is written upon this head in the explanation of Saybrook platform—alſo to a book wrote by Iſrael Holly, paſtor of a church of Chriſt in Suffield, a word in Zions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p>Nextly I will proceed to anſwer ſome objections which doubtleſs will be made againſt this performance, by thoſe that are zealous for the religious conſtitution of this colony.</p>
            <p>Objection firſt. Your plan denies the wicked or unconverted to vote in chooſing a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and allows only the godly or church members to chooſe their miniſter, which we think is not juſt, for two reaſons; firſt, the unconverted in the ſociety muſt be oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear the church's miniſter, when they are excluded any right of choice: ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it muſt be againſt reaſon to tax them to ſupport a man that was excluded from chooſing.—Anſwer, firſt the objector ſaith your plan denies &amp;c.—But he would equally ſpoke the truth, if he had ſaid the word of God denies &amp;c.—For upon that my plan is founded, as I have already ſhewn, and could fill a volume in vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:010621_0131_0F81BA228D5164B0"/>
of it: read <hi>Ezra</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> 2.20. 1. <hi>Corin.</hi> 2.14, 15. But let us reaſon the point a little—if the ſociety members have the right to chooſe the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, than the church has not. But if the church has the right, the ſociety have not. For the church and ſociety are two diſtinct bodies. So in their nature and formation, the one is qualified to act by money, and the other by a viſible profeſſion of faith in Chriſt; and perfect wiſdom has never pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced theſe bodies in that poſition, which tends to deſtroy his churches right of choice or acting in his rule. But you may ſay, they ſhould unite together in their choice— anſwer, What if the ſociety refuſes to join with the church, who can help in ſuch a caſe? or if they vote together, and upon trial, the church members and ſociety mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers are equal and their be a tie, what ſhall be done? or if the ſociety has the vote, who in the exerciſe of right reaſon and knowledge of the truth, can think that a money qualification ſhall either rob the church of Chriſt of her juſt right, or force a man upon her contrary to her judgment, both which is abſurd and unreaſonable? therefore it remains the churches right to chooſe her own miniſters, and that from Scripture and reaſon; for ſhe is obliged in
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:010621_0132_0F81BA2352FA42D8"/>
her choice, to chooſe the man that Chriſt has qualified and directed to—a holy god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man, gifted and qualified therefor; which man the ſociety with their money qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, are likely to hate and diſpiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.29. and where is the power ſhort of the arm of Jehovah, that can make a perſon or people love God or his miniſters?— Furthermore. The objector makes a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take about my plan, to ſay the ſociety or any man muſt be forced; for there is no force in my whole plan, upon any man or men, to hear the church's miniſter. The church of Chriſt never did force, neither has ſhe any diſpoſition nor power thereto. She keeps open and free worſhip, without money or price; any otherwiſe, than what the congregation is willing to give freely; ſhe uſes no other force than ſcripture and reaſon; and what that does not effect, is left undone by them through time; they invite, intreat, and beſeech, and warn, and ſo leave every individual to ſtand or fall to their own maſter. And as to the civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers having any thing to do in the affair, that muſt be denied, till their warrant is ſhewn from the written word of God— The 2d thing in the objection is, that it muſt be againſt reaſon, to force perſons to
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:010621_0133_0F81BA24174D9380"/>
ſupport a man in the miniſtry, that they was excluded from chuſing. Anſwer, I grant that it is againſt reaſon and ſcripture too; but perhaps the objector has not well conſidered his own plan. When did any that like the colony plan, ſay it is unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to tax widows, rich or poor, they are no voters in chuſing a miniſter, nor any man that falls ſhort of fifty ſhillings or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty pounds in the common liſt, altho' they be as holy as Enoch, and not in the church? theſe are all excluded voting. And who ſaith this is againſt reaſon? Or who faults the plan, for taxing them that are of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther principle and church, and have choſe, and maintain another miniſter? I would in meekneſs adviſe thoſe that make the objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to look well at home firſt, and get things rectified and made reaſonable there before he faults his neighbour; for in my plan, there is no force, nor civil power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in the caſe; neither is there any injury done to any man's civil intereſt, nor conſcience in this whole plan that I am ſo earneſtly contending for.—The church of Jeſus Chriſt, wants no man's attention or purſe further than he is pleaſed to act and give. The miniſters of Chriſt teach the whole counſels of God, that reſpects their
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:010621_0134_0F81BA24CB6BEF58"/>
duty to the people, and in its place they teach, that they that are taught in the word, ſhould communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. but if the people refuſe to contribute &amp;c. the church has nothing further to do with them that are without; 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.12, 13. they and their money retained in covetouſneſs will periſh together; as to any thing that the church can do, if the Lord in mercy does not prevent. But to cloſe my anſwer to this objection, I ſhall refer my reader to what Mr. <hi>Mather,</hi> before cited, has wrote upon this head, ſee queſtion 9. page 67.
<q>Ought all that contribute towards the maintenance, to have the privilege of voting in the election of a paſtor? An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. It would be ſimonical to affirm, that this ſacred privilege may be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with money, or that contributions can entitle to it; for 1ſt this is againſt the ſcriptures, and that in more reſpects than one; and ſo on he writes &amp;c.</q>
Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection 2. By your plan miniſters ought not to make any civil contract with the people, nor any tax be made for their ſupport, nor civil powers to be concerned in the whole affair; and if ſo, our good miniſters will be ſtarved out of their pulpits, and we ſhall
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:010621_0135_0F81BA25EE4B5950"/>
have no regular miniſters nor churches in the Land in a few years.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I have ſufficiently anſwered the firſt part of this objection, and ſhewn from the ſcriptures that miniſters have no precept nor example in all the bible, to make any civil contract with the people for their ſupport: nor have civil rulers any direction from God's word, to put forth civil power in that affair; ſo that it will be time enough for me to make a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, when the force of my arguments are taken off, and I am ſhewn wherein I have perverted the ſcriptures that I have brought to vindicate my principles in this affair.</p>
            <p>But let us attend a little to the ſecond part of the objection, viz. our good mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters will ſtarve &amp;c. It is likely thoſe that make the objection, little think what is fairly contained in it, for if the miniſters be good, then it reproaches the wiſdom and power and faithfulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, that he ſhould ſet up miniſters and leave them to ſtarve in his work. It intimates that Chriſt has got careleſs of his cauſe, and not true to his word, all which is moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably wicked. Chriſt ſaith in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19 20. <hi>Go ye therefore and teach, teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:010621_0136_0F81BA2656C0F380"/>
you: and lo, I am with you always even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world. Amen.</hi> Therefore I am ſlow to believe, that any miniſter that obtains grace to abide in theſe conditions, will ſtarve in a land of plenty; altho' all civil powers is againſt him. And more eſpecially when I conſider that God is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form in all his ways, and works, and ſends none a warfare without providing all things neceſſary therefor, 1 Cor. 9.7. Who goeth a warfare any time at his own charges? 2 Tim. 2.4. Again, Luke 22. And he ſaid unto them, when I ſent you without purſe, and ſcrip, and ſhoes, lacked ye any thing? and they ſaid, nothing. Pray mind, that Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, to-day, and forever. For he hath hitherto ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported his miniſters from age to age, when all civil power was againſt them. Witneſs the apoſtolic age, and the reformation from popery, and the preſent day, in which civil and eccleſiaſtical powers was, and is againſt Chriſt's miniſters and cauſe: Yet Chriſt found out ways to carry his plan and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns thro' even down to our day. Witneſs the deſſenting miniſters at Old England; they have been comfortably ſupported for more than one hundred years, without ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil power, collectors or priſons, having any
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:010621_0137_0F81BA271659B5D0"/>
concern therein. It muſt be a ſtrange pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radox indeed, to conclude that the religion of Chriſt ſhould looſe its proper vertue and nature of influencing and governing mens hearts, lives, and practice, only by paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over from Old England, to new, and by that time it takes place in Connecticut, it is ſo enfeebled, that it cannot produce the ſame effect upon the hearts and lives of Men, here, as there; but to make up the deficiency, there muſt be added the power of the civil arm, the general aſſembly, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior and county courts, juſtices of the peace, collectors, and priſons, waſting of goods, and life at the end, for what the law has done to preſerve it, all threatning the perſon that putteth not into the miniſters mouths. Micah 3.5. And he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war againſt him. Obſerve further. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſtance of place that alters the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt. See this ſide the briny ocean, the ſame effect is produced here as there. For more than one hundred years Boſton and Charleſtown (the place of my nativity) have ſupported their miniſters by a free contribution; there is no civil pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er exerciſed in the affair; and one would think a hundred years experience in any
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:010621_0138_0F81BA27CBE97810"/>
practice, is long enough to know whether it will anſwer the end or not. But the truth is, it has been tryed as long as Chriſt has had a miniſtry here upon earth, and has never failed. This day ſtill ſpeaks with a loud and ſtriking voice, the truth and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant faithfulneſs of the ever bleſſed Son of God. Witneſs the ſupport of myſelf and brethern in the miniſtry in this refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; for conſider you that made the objection, how comes it to paſs, that we lay-teachers have been ſupported, ſome of us, near 20 years, and ſome of us conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able families, and but low in the world, and but few that wait on our miniſtry, in ſome places, in compariſon of the lawful aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and them few moſtly low in the world, that do ſcarcely bring the year a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, as we uſed to ſay; and beſides all this diſadvantage, our ſubſtance hal'd away from us, to ſupport your miniſters, by the civil power, (falſely ſo called) and ſold at the ſign-poſt, for a ſong, or trifle; great waſte made at times of our ſubſtance; which we procured by the help of kind Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in hard labour; additional hereto, at times our bodies ſeiz'd, and carried off to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and our buſineſs left? The reader may eaſily think how when the head of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is thus confined, our friends are in tears,
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:010621_0139_0F81BA28DCB99F58"/>
at our being haled away in ſuch a manner, and the poor collectors like Cain, with their countenances fallen, and full of wrath, or a paleneſs and trembling ſeizing them, like Belſhazzar, when he ſaw the hand-writing upon the wall. Now notwithſtanding all this, we are comfortably ſupported thro' the abundant goodneſs, and pure mercy of our ever true and faithful Lord and Maſter, who makes out to a tittle, all his gracious engagements to his miniſters, church and people. That you do not hear us mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt our flocks crying, more ſalary, more ſalary! or we will leave you, &amp;c. No, this hath not as yet been the caſe: but there is no thanks nor praiſe due to us, for we and our little flocks, are as liable to be entangled with human ſchemes, worldly mindedneſs, diſtruſt of God and covetouſneſs, as our neighbours; the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence lies not in us, but in our good, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſovereign Lord, whoſe free grace, wiſdom, and power, and righteous plan ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects theſe things in us, and for us; and all the praiſe is entirely and forever due to him alone. Therefore with liberty I would propound this queſtion to thoſe that may make the objection, viz. What is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that we get along under all theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages (being deluded as you ſay) and
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:010621_0140_0F81BA294EC111B0"/>
you being in the truth, under all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages poſſible almoſt, and your miniſters ſtarve without the civil law to ſupport them? Pray, let this take your attention! and do not let it paſs without a juſt ſolution. But perhaps ſome will think, that they have ſolved the queſtion, viz. That it is the high falſe zeal, that ſeperates have, that makes them ſo bountiful towards their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in ſupporting them? I anſwer, that this is quite unlikely, for this reaſon, they are equally inclined to love the world as their neighbours, and it is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, that, ſuch a high falſe zeal ſhould laſt in ſuch a ſteady uninterrupted manner for 20 years; more ſpecially when there is ſo little zeal of late years among them, either good or bad. But if I may ſhew my opinion in the caſe, I rather think, that it is more from light and knowledge of the ſcripture rule of ſupporting the goſpel that they act then from high falſe zeal. For having underſtood that the goſpel is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the contributions of the people, they act, zeal or no zeal; yet doubtleſs ſometimes love to God and his cauſe, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly governs in the hearts of the ſaints; and then they find the word of God fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in them, that it is more bleſſed to give, than to receive, Acts 20, 35.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:010621_0141_0F81BA2A0E50A470"/>Secondly. If it be true, as the objection ſaith that theſe miniſters and churches would crumble down, the miniſters have no ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, if the prop of the civil law was taken away, and they have no help from that quarter. Then I think it unavoidably fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that the miniſters and churches of this plan, are not formed nor made by Chriſt, but by and from men in their own inventions, for Chriſt's church and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have liv'd from age to age, when all civil power was ſet to deſtroy them; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the fields of blood the church has waded through from time to time, which church hiſtory teſtifieth of. I think that church that cannot ſubſiſt without civil power to uphold it, has the ſcripture mark of a falſe or harlot church, Rev. 17, chap. 13. So on the contrary, that religion which is from Chriſt, implanted in the heart, has that governing and authority in its own nature, upon the ſubjects of it, that from divine love to the author of it, they freely move forward to do all that duty, made manifeſt to the underſtanding; without fear of puniſhment either from God or man. Puniſhment as a ruling motive is out of the queſtion. The ſaints of God do not attend duty for fear of hell, but pure, chaſte love governs in ſome degree in the
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:010621_0142_0F81BA2E7110EDA8"/>
heart, to do duty, ſee 1 John 5, 3. For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous. Here reader, (as delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as you may think I am) I teſtify is the very eſſence and ſoul of true religion deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed. The ſubjects of it ſee ſuch wiſdom, juſtice and righteouſneſs, power and purity, ſhining forth in all God's commands, as raviſhes the heart with ſuch holy delight and complacency: ſo that the perſons li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, joy and happineſs lies in keeping the ſame. This, this religion wants no civil power under heaven to ſupport it; but falſe religion, or that which men's wiſdom has planned, cannot well ſubſiſt without civil power, to be its prop. Now if there be any truth in the objection, (as I am prone to think there is) then it followeth, that the religious conſtitution of this colony is not of God, but has its original from mens wiſdom, and may be ſeen deſcribed in the word of God, by all that will not ſhut their eyes againſt the light. I will point my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to his character, ſee Ezek. 44, 6 to 10. and thou ſhalt ſay to the rebellious, &amp;c. Here God faults his church for bringing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his houſe unconverted perſons, through which means his holy things was polluted, and this is the ſtate of poor Connecticut;
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:010621_0143_0F81BA2F35F42DF8"/>
they have let down their watch, in admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting members into their churches, almoſt any perſon, that has common grace to keep him from out-breaking ſins, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the churches of this conſtitution, altho' their converſation diſcovers reigning enmity in their heart againſt God and the influences of his Holy Spirit upon the hearts and lives of the godly. This is and ſhould be for a lamentation; becauſe it opens the door wide for a revolt from God, and his rules and laws, which the text plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheweth. Our godly fore-fathers ſaw this dreadful evil, and trembled with fear. See Mr. Mather, before cited, in the epiſtle page 8. "If we eſpouſe ſuch principles as theſe, namely, that churches are not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the regeneration of thoſe whom they admit into their communion, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ſacraments is to be left wholly to the prudence and conſcience of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. — That explicit covenanting with God, and with the church is needleſs. That perſons not qualified for communion, in ſpecial ordinances, ſhall elect paſtors for churches. That all profeſſed chriſtians have a right to baptiſm. That brethren are to have no voice in eccleſiaſtical councils. That the eſſence of a miniſter's call is not in the election of the people; but in the
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:010621_0144_0F81BA30DC787F78"/>
ceremony of impoſing hands &amp;c. We then give away the whole congregational cauſe at once." Thus this godly man writes. But it would have ſuited me much better, if he had ſaid, we give up the cauſe of Chriſt in the affairs of his viſible kingdom, all at once—for I lay no ſtreſs upon names of diſtinction. What I would is to be a true follower of Jeſus Chriſt, and let men call me as they like.</p>
            <p>Now candid reader, ſee how exactly this paſſage (which was Mr. Mather's fears) deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the ſtanding and practice of theſe conſociated churches, as exact as if he now lived and took the deſcription from the preſent practice of theſe churches. But this was printed ten years before Saybrook plan; and quite likely that Mr. Mather underſtood what theſe lordly miniſters had got upon the wheel to bring about, which was the cauſe of his teſtimony againſt it. And this further confirms me in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that thoſe that compiled them articles of diſcipline in Saybrook plan, underſtood themſelves to mean as the articles ſay and as Mr. Hobart pleads. And that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainer of that plan quite miſt the mind of thoſe that compoſed and eſtabliſhed them. Here I think is ſomething worthy of notice, that this learned, godly miniſter law things
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:010621_0145_0F81BA3196432860"/>
as I now do, many years before I was born, for I never ſaw his book until after I began this piece: and if he is deluded, ſo am I: but if he was in the truth, ſo ſhall I be found in the truth, in theſe my obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon this plan. Further Mr. Mather writes, page 32. "Anſwer 2, the practice of the churches in New-England, as to this particular, is lawful, laudable and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying: it is lawful for churches to deſire thoſe that offer themſelves to holy fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, to give an account of their faith and repentance, and when a church deſires it, no capable perſon ought to refuſe it; for, firſt, there is a ſcripture warrant for this practice," &amp;c. Now opening the church's doors to let in graceleſs perſons, (which as I underſtand is the practice of all the churches in the conſtitution) makes way for the other heavy ſtroke, as in the text laſt cited, ver. 8. And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things, but ye have ſet keepers of my charge in my ſanctuary, for yourſelves. Obſerve, when a church lets down their watch, and lets in unconverted perſons into the church, then it is natural for ſuch members to chooſe unconverted men for their miniſters, to be over them, as the Lord complains in this text. And ſo the old proverb is verified, Like people,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:010621_0146_0F81BA3258ACDD30"/>
like prieſt; unconverted members, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted miniſters: which is doubtleſs the ſhocking caſe of the main of this colony and land. I actually fear that the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of this conſtitution abound with uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted members, and the land with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted miniſters. A Heavy judgment of God upon the land! and that becauſe chriſtian profeſſors have not kept the charge of God's holy things: not duly reſpecting the rules Chriſt has given his church to walk by, in admitting her members and miniſters. Therefore, I firmly believe, that theſe ſcriptures following are rightly applied to this generation. Micah 7.4. The day of thy watchmen, and thy viſitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cometh, now ſhall be their perplexity. Zech. 11.3, 4.5. There is a voice of the howling of the ſhepherds, for their glory is ſpoiled. Thus ſaith the Lord my God, feed the flock of the ſlaughter; whoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſors ſlay them, and hold themſelves not guilty, and they that fell them ſay, bleſſed be the Lord, for I am rich: and their own ſhepherds pity them not, Micah 3.5.6, 11. And he that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war againſt him. Therefore night ſhall be unto you, that ye ſhall not have a viſion, and it ſhall be dark unto you, that ye ſhall not divine,
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:010621_0147_0F81BA3318EBBED8"/>
and the ſun ſhall go down over the prophets' and the day ſhall be dark over them. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 3.12, 14. <hi>O my people, they which lead thee, cauſe thee to err, and deſtroy the way of thy paths. For ye have eaten up the vineyard; the ſpoil of the poor is in your houſes.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Likely ſome of my readers will ſay, that I am a very cenſorious perſon to charge the church members and their miniſters, with being unconverted. Anſwer. I am wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to put my credit upon a fair goſpel trial.—Chriſt ſaith a tree is known by its fruit. Let them that experimentally know Jeſus Chriſt, and his ſpirits work and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon mens hearts make the trial; carefully examining church members, member by member, and miniſter by mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, to ſee what they knew of a work of grace, or the ſanctifying operations of God's ſpirit. And I firmly believe my credit will ſtand good with all ſuch as know the goſpel fruits of true chriſtianity; and as for the reſt, I expect to lie under their cenſor. But they will do well to take good heed leſt they be found at laſt to be the perſons, that they charge me to be, and I innocent of the charge. But this I will venture to affirm, that upwards of fifteen years ago, the holy ſpirit of God led me to ſee the ſtanding of the churches of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
<pb n="151"
                   facs="unknown:010621_0148_0F81BA33CAE2D998"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the 44th of Ezek. before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and equally true it is, that their character is drawn in Iſaiah 29, 13. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord ſaid, for as much as this people draw near me with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me; but have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved their heart far from me, and their fear towards me is taught by the precept of men. This paſſage of ſacred writ perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agrees with the objection, which ſaith, if the churches and miniſters have not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port by civil rulers, they will all crumble down, and ſo ſaith this text, viz. That there is no more of God among them, than God's precepts make. Here is a perfect glaſs, that all my dear neighbours, and friends, that hold the conſtitution, may ſee their face in. For take away mens precepts and your religion is all up, by your own opinion, ſo that here I ſhall ſlip out of the queſtion, and cloſe my anſwer to this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, for you and the ſcriptures have ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the point, and both agree that there is no more religion in this conſtitution, than what is made by men, and that is poor enough.</p>
            <p>Objection 3. I am quite diſſatisfied with your writing, for it appears plain that your whole aim is to ſtrike up the whole of our religious conſtitution, root and branch, and
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:010621_0149_0F81BA34A9E79D88"/>
that will undoe the colony—all manner of wickedneſs and prophaneſs will prevail— we ſhall be as bad as they are at New-York or Rhode-Iſland—there is no fault in the religious conſtitution, but the want of more tolleration; and I wiſh the aſſembly would releaſe all the ſeparates, for I do not want their money to ſupport my worſhip.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. I freely confeſs my deſign is, the Lord willing, graciouſly to help me, to hold this religious conſtitution forth in its own nature, in the light of the ſcriptures, that is may be ſeen to be what it is, for I firmly believe, that all perſons who ſee it in ſcripture light, will hold up both hands (if need be) for its final overthrow. Sure I am, that it is the duty of all that ſee and know that Jeſus Chriſt is anointed king in Zion, the rightful Lord of conſcience, to improve all their knowledge, grace and gifts for its overthrow, and if Divine Light and truth proves its overthrow, no-body ought to be offended thereat; and if ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and right reaſon, be admitted into the mind, with its own weight and force, and it does not prove its final ruin, then I ſay let it live and proſper. But then I muſt beg liberty to deny the conſequence drawn in the objection, that it will undoe the colony, to fling up the conſtitution. I am obliged,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:010621_0150_0F81BA354C5FA5F8"/>
as I underſtand the ſcriptures, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, to think quite the reverſe; that in fact the colony will be ruined, and an undone people, if it is not flung up, and every man left, to chooſe articles of faith, miniſter, and place of divine worſhip for himſelf, and not be controuled by civil powers. We do well to weigh this point thoroughly; and in order to it, it is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between the civil and divine kingdom. Not rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding here is the cauſe of the greateſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, now ſubſiſting about religion. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, civil rulers as they anſwer the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter given them in the word of God, as his miniſters for the people's good. Rom. 3. 1 to 5. I underſtand the whole of their work, is as followeth, 1. Under God, (and as ſet by him for that end) to preſerve life. 2. Property. 3. Liberty. Life when it is expoſed by the deſigns of wicked men, or otherwiſe, the rulers aid is wanted; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, by the execution of wholeſome and righteous laws to preſerve every one in their juſt, legal rights and properties. Liberty by defending every one of different ſects, in their ſacred rights of conſcience, not allowing one ſect to diſturb another, while they are peaceably &amp; publickly worſhipping God, as they think is beſt pleaſing in his gracious
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:010621_0151_0F81BA38CFB11ED0"/>
ſight. Here I underſtand is the extent of rulers work. It does not belong to them to ſay, who is qualified for church-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip, or not; who ſhall be a church, or who not; nor to ſay where perſons ſhall worſhip, and where not; or what lines ſhall be the limits of a church, or who is quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to chooſe a miniſter, and who not; or who ſhall preach, &amp; be a miniſter and who not. To ſum up all, they have nothing to do (as civil rulers) with any thing that reſpects the religious worſhip that God requires of his church and people. This I have ſhewn in the beginning of my diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Thus dividing between the civil and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine kingdom, let us conſider what hurt is done to any man's civil intereſt, by different ſects worſhipping God in different places in the ſame town. Society lines muſt be denied, till civil rulers ſhew their warrant from the word of God, to make them; and all civil bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs neceſſary to be done, may be done in the town limits, and what is otherwiſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to every religious community to ſay. This is not a new ſtarted principle of mine; ſee Saybrook confeſſion, page 101, head 5. "Tho' parochial bounds be not of divine right, yet for common edification, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a particular church ought, as much as conveniently may be, to live near one
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:010621_0152_0F81BA39A9A95820"/>
another." The reader ſhould keep in mind how common a thing it is for this plan to contradict itſelf: the laws have fixed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh lines, and every perſon muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to them bounds, altho' their teacher be as Chriſt ſaith, a thief and a robber, John 10, 1. Or let conſcience ſay what it will about the worſhip—To return to the point, there can no hurt come to any man's civil or natural right, by different ſects, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing allowed, and preſerved in the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of worſhipping God, as each party thinks moſt agreable to God's word. Since I have liv'd in Middletown, there has been 5 different worſhips in the town, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of a mile on the Lord's day, beſides the conſtitution, and church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and ſeparates, there was a number of Dutch, in one private houſe, and the neutral French, in another, and no damage accrued to any man's property, or civil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, any more than if they had all wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped under one roof; and had there been added, Baptiſts, Quakers, and Moravians, it makes no odds, as to mens civil pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. If any perſon of either of theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions breaks the civil law, he lies open to puniſhment, equally ſo, as if there was but one profeſſion in the town. I think it will not weaken the hands of civil rulers,
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:010621_0153_0F81BA39F7738E80"/>
that rule for God, to have different profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in a town or colony. For conſider perſons in different profeſſions, finding themſelves favoured with an equal ſhare of liberty, with the reſt of their neighbours, and fellow ſubjects, it will in my opinion have a natural tendency to knit their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and dutiful regard to their rulers, ſtronger, if it can be, than if they was all of one opinion in religion. The contrary is alſo evident, that when perſons know that the Moſt High, is the alone abſolute Lord of conſcience; and that no mortal breathing has any right to hinder them from thinking and acting for themſelves, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious affairs; and now for civil rulers to ſet up and eſtabliſh the ſect that pleaſes them, and deprive all the reſt of their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual ſhare of liberty, and force their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to go againſt the light of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, or ſuffer fines and impriſonments, or great waſte of goods, &amp;c. Sure I am, that nothing is more likely to alienate good ſubjects from due affection, and dutiful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their civil rulers, than ſuch a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; for the beſt of men have the remains of corruption in them, and when they are thus unjuſtly treated, they need the ſtrong hand of ſanctifying grace, to keep them at the feet of their oppreſſors and perſecutors.
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:010621_0154_0F81BA3ABA8B1368"/>
The law of nature, reaſon and grace, will lay ſubjects under ſtrong obligations to their rulers, when equal juſtice is miniſtred to them of different principles, in the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of religion: they will all as one unite, and offer all dutiful ſubjection, and aid to their rulers, to help them thro' their work, in the adminiſtring equal juſtice for the good of the whole. But as things now are, poſſibly ſome of as good ſubjects, as is in the colony, are obliged from a due regard to the Lord Jeſus, to refuſe ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and obedience to the civil rulers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, when they are putting into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion their eccleſiaſtical laws, and not from any diſlike to their perſons neither. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are acquainted with church hiſtory, know that the eſtabliſhing religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and compelling others that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer therefrom, to ſubject thereto, has been the bone of contention through Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from age to age, and the unhappy cauſe of rivers of blood being ſhed, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their conſtitutions. I will venture to affirm, that no religious conſtitution, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by a civil law, in a kingdom, or colony, where God works by his word preached, through the ſpirits aid, can be preſerved, without they perſecute more or leſs. Probably all that eſteem the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:010621_0155_0F81BA3B5DE146D8"/>
of this colony, look upon it the beſt that they know of, in all the reformed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: yet it bringeth forth this bitter fruit of perſecution, and oppreſſion, more than the national eſtabliſhment. I preſume, that thro' Great Britain, or the whole nation, there cannot be found that done by civil law againſt the glorious work of God's ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that has been poured out of late years, as has been done in this colony. But this is certain, that the church of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſuch, never perſecutes, nor does the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ever ſhew that they never put any to priſon, for the ſake of religion, or for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcienciouſly diſcharging religious duty. But the falſe, antichriſtian church has from age to age, and ſo has this of this conſtitution, impriſoned the ſaints for nothing elſe but their attending chriſtian duties plainly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the great God; the duty of exhortation, and of expounding the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and preaching the goſpel, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping God according to their conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Therefore it remains for you who have thus acted, to get under that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, given you in Rev. 2.10. Behold the devil ſhall caſt ſome of you into priſon; meaning thoſe perſons that are under the devil's influence, of pride, malice, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and perſecution, ſhall caſt the
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:010621_0156_0F81BA3C2D7E54F0"/>
ſaints, &amp;c. Wherefore it appears to me, that inſtead of the colony's being ruined by enacting full and free liberty of conſcience, it is the moſt likely, if not the only remedy to ſave it from confuſion, and final ruin: for ſuch a liberty has a natural tendency to unite all parties in good neighbourhood, to ſtrive together in all civil things for the good of the whole civil body, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary for its ruin. But the Saybrook plan aſſerts, that there is no warrant for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate to abridge ſober conſcientious profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors from their liberty of worſhipping God as they ſhall think fit, ſee page 74. Yet their eccleſiaſtical laws, confronts their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles; and no marvel, that when a plan contradicts God's word, that it ſhould fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently contradict itſelf, &amp;c. That there is no foundation to eſtabliſh a religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, by force of civil laws, I think is evident by what followeth, firſt conſider who, or what profeſſion ſhall have this eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment? you will ſay thoſe that are orthodox, and ſound in the faith. But that is to ſay nothing to the caſe, becauſe every one is ſo to himſelf, &amp; doubtleſs thinks he is in the right way to heaven, altho' in fact, he may be in the way to hell. Witneſs the papiſts, they think that they are in the very apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick order, therefore force all to comply
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:010621_0157_0F81BA3D3B290CD0"/>
with their religious conſtitution, that they may be ſaved. But you may further ſay, thoſe that are truly ſanctified and holy in heart, and take the ſcriptures for their only rule of faith and practice. Anſwer. How ſhall civil rulers, as ſuch, know ſuch a people, in order to eſtabliſh them? do you not deny the knowledge of the ſaints? But granting that they be known by their fruits. Yet I dare affirm, ſuch a people would utterly refuſe ſuch an eſtabliſhment, and for theſe reaſons, firſt, in that they that are holy in heart, know that all grace, light, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, faith and holineſs, is entirely the free gift of God, out of the power of any mortal to convey, and that they themſelves are poor ſinful beggars, that daily want more grace for themſelves; ſo that they neither ſet up themſelves in high dignity, above their neighbours, nor want to be inveſted with any power for that end; but only ſay to their fellow profeſſors and neighbours as in Mat. 25.9. But go ye rather to them that ſell, and buy for yourſelves. Note here, they are pointed to the ſame fountain of all grace, and there left to ſtand or fall, accept or reject, &amp;c. Secondly, theſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſeeing that the written word of God is the alone rule of faith and practice, in all their obedience, and divine love to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:010621_0158_0F81BA3D903FC270"/>
of that rule, is the ſoul ſpring to move a perſon forward to obey what that rule injoins. So that they deteſt and abhor the notion of civil powers being concerned in all the affair. Further they know, that the utmoſt that civil power can do, in ſuch affairs, is but to make men miſerable hypocrites; for they cannot make one true follower of Jeſus Chriſt, with all their force. Indeed I muſt confeſs it is beyond me to account for (any man of good ſenſe and reaſon, that is experimentally acquainted with true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion) pretending to plead up for a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious conſtitution, to be eſtabliſhed by ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil powers; for in truth there is nothing for civil rulers to do in the whole affair. It is agreed on by all, that there is a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect rule already given in the ſcriptures, for faith and practice; and we look for no addition or ſupplement thereto. And it is equally granted, that civil rulers cannot make any man believe in Chriſt, nor love or obey him in the leaſt of his commands. Therefore in meekneſs, I aſk the zealous advocates for this conſtitution, what is the work that God aſſigns to rulers to do in a religious conſtitution? And what part of ſacred writ ſhall I find their directions giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en them? You will likely ſay in the old teſtament, in the books of Moſes, for he
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:010621_0159_0F81BA3E695563F0"/>
was a civil ruler, and he ordered the affairs of the church and worſhip of God. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. When our civil rulers can ſhew that they depend upon and go to God as Moſes did, for their direction. See Num. 9.8.9. And Moſes ſaid unto then, Sand ſtill, and I will hear what the Lord will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand concerning you. And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes, ſaying, &amp;c. Obſerve, here was a matter of difficulty reſpecting ſome that was defiled by a dead body: Moſes nor the Levites does not preſcribe in this caſe, but God alone: So that I would charitably hope, that the advocates for this plan won't ſay, that our rulers when they enacted theſe eccleſiaſtical laws, ſtood thus before God as Moſes did, to have God immediately by a voice tell them, that this act ſhall be ſo, and that ſo; or that every man that had fifty ſhillings or forty pounds in the liſt, ſhould be as good vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for to chooſe a miniſter, as the moſt godly, &amp;c. Nor yet that they was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately inſpired by the Holy Spirit to plan them laws: So that unleſs this is made out of our rulers, the objection muſt fall; but the truth is, that under the Moſaick diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, there was no king or law-giver to Iſrael or the church, but God himſelf, until Saul was given; at which time Iſrael
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:010621_0160_0F81BA3F0F9165B8"/>
had their minds alienated from God, and did not like that he ſhould be their alone king; but they choſe to have ſome imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect man ſet over them to be their king, like other nations. Yet it is plain, that in the days of Moſes, he acted nothing from himſelf, but God alone was the ſole legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature; he gave out the laws civil and ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical. Therefore it was, that in that diſpenſation they ſtood ſo together, or that Moſes gave the laws of both tables. And if our civil rulers had the like direction from God himſelf, we might ſafe enough ſubmit to their preſcriptions in religious affairs; but till this is made out, we have no warrant to regard them in any of their eccleſiaſtical preſcriptions.</p>
            <p>Again, I think it will bare to ſay, that no man that holds liberty of conſcience, can admit of a religious eſtabliſhment by civil powers, and be conſiſtent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This will appear very evident in the following metaphor, as thus,—ſuppoſing Peter has the right to make the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as beſt ſuits him. By the way ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that an eſtabliſhment is nothing, if it has not compulſive power to have all in its limits, ſubject to this plan; and if ſo, where then is John's right of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or James's liberty of conſcience? I
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:010621_0161_0F81BA3FD7DFD100"/>
think it is all ſtruck up, at the ſuppoſition of Peter's right to make an eſtabliſhment John and James's liberty is reſolved into Peter's will; and what if Peter will not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate John and James? for mind it is granted, that Peter has a right, &amp;c. Here then it is plain that John and James are fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally deprived of their right, &amp;c. I earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly want, deſire and pray, that my honeſt neighbours might rightly underſtand them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they ſay, <hi>Liberty of conſcience in Connecticut,</hi> and at the ſame time ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, <hi>We have got a good religious conſtitution.</hi> I dare bid the challenge to all mortals breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to extricate and deliver John and James out of their difficulties, while Peter maintains his right of eſtabliſhment. In this figure is the true ſtate of this colony. The cry is, that their is liberty of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence here; but it is not true, for the ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates have gone to the general aſſembly, with their prayers, from year to year, aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but their juſt right, full and free liberty of conſcience, and have been, and are ſtill denied their requeſt.</p>
            <p>Again, the objection ſaith, the fault is not in the conſtitution, but the want of more toleration. Let us conſider this in the former figure. The objector ſuppoſes, that Peter ought to tolerate John and James,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:010621_0162_0F81BA4090ECC768"/>
becauſe they appear to be honeſt well mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons, and altho' they have made a miſtake in religion, yet it is hopeful they may be Chriſtians;—they do not diſturbe their neighbours that differ from them in religion, and they are as loyal ſubjects in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil kingdom, as their neighbours: therefore they ought to have liberty of conſcience, and not be compelled to worſhip, or ſupport a worſhip contrary to their ſolid judgment. Thus far ſome will ſay, that are zealous for the conſtitution, and little think that they have in effect deſtroyed their good conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. For conſider, if it be reaſonable and right that John and James, ſhould have liberty, then it muſt be equally right that Mark and Luke, being in the like caſe as John, ſhould have equal liberty. Alſo, Job and David, being well acquainted with the ſcriptures, and look upon Peter's plan contrary thereto, and ſo dare not for a world comply therewith, by reaſon of an infinite ſuperior power, requiring their obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience otherwiſe. Therefore they challeng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as their juſt right, the like liberty that John and the reſt have got. Now reader, you may eaſily ſee what will become of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's good conſtitution, by and by in this practice, which is, and muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be right, by all that hold liberty
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:010621_0163_0F81BA4151EF7228"/>
of conſcience; for there is the ſame parity of reaſon, that a hundred religious commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities ſhould be releaſed as to releaſe one. But the truth of all is, that allowing liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience the right of thinking and acting for one's ſelf, in religious matters, to be true doctrine according to the word of God (which doctrine has always been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be ſound and good by all true proteſtants and chriſtians) then I think it unavoidably ſtrikes up all religious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions (eſtabliſhed by civil power) under heaven. For right reaſon dictates, that if John had a right to think and act for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in religious matters, it is impoſſible for Peter to have any right to hinder him: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe we ſhall make perfect wiſdom the author of confuſſion. Again, in other words, if it be the mind of God revealed in his word, that John ſhall chuſe articles of faith and practice for himſelf, and a church and miniſter that he believes to be of God; then it followeth that no powers whatſoever has any right to hinder, or prevent him from enjoying what God has enjoined upon him and commanded. This all muſt grant, that no man or men may alter what the Almighty has granted or decreed; and he has decreed that every one ſhall ſtand or fall to his own maſter, is plain in the ſcriptures, and
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:010621_0164_0F81BA420AD6CF90"/>
in this reſpect no man has a right to judge another man's ſervant, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again, The objection ſaith, that if the conſtitution be flung up, all manner of wickedneſs and profaneneſs will prevail, and we ſhall be as bad as they be at New-York or Rhode-Iſland, &amp;c. I reply, it is a ſandy foundation indeed, to ſet up a conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution upon a bare conſequence. The thing to be ſettled, is not what will be, but what is; which is to ſay, Is the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on right, or is it wrong? This ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the attention of all; for it is a matter of the greateſt importance, to know. I think that I have ſufficiently ſhewn, from ſcripture and reaſon, that it is altogether wrong, contrary to the word of God; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ought to be rejected, let the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be what it will. But let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the matter carefully, paredventure there is a miſtake made about the conſequence, for if this religious conſtitution has ſuch vertue and power in it, to preſerve from all manner of wickedneſs and profaneneſs, how comes it to paſs, that all manner of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, has ſo much prevailed in this colony, ſince it was ſet up? Let the aged, greyhead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed fathers, look back and conſider, how the times was, before this conſtitution was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed by law, as to profane ſwearing,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:010621_0165_0F81BA433303CC98"/>
the ſin of uncleanneſs, and neglect of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly government; alſo the ſin of oppreſſion, brother going to law with brother, drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs and ſabbath breaking, pride and haughtineſs; and then turn his thoughts, and ſee how the times are now, as to theſe ſinful practices. And I dare ſay they muſt know that the times are vaſtly worſe now. That the conſtitution in all its glory and power, does not prevent theſe growing evils; ſo that the objection muſt be fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. Indeed it is my ſolid opinion of the conſtitution, that it has opened the door for the growth of all the wickedneſs that now prevails in the land. My reaſons are as followeth, firſt, for admitting in uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted perſons into the churches. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, making money an eſſential qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification to vote for miniſters. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, theſe diſqualified perſons, voting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the miniſtry unconverted men. 4. The eccleſiaſtical laws, aſſuming that authority and rule that belongs to Jeſus Chriſt, and exerciſed in his church. 5. The body of the colony combining together, to deſpiſe and reject the holy ſpirit of God, as it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates upon the hearts of the children of men. 6. Civil rulers and officers under them, criminally neglecting to put into execution, thoſe civil laws of the
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:010621_0166_0F81BA43A1A22F08"/>
colony, that are good and wholeſome; ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuppreſs the growth of the many wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed practices now prevailing amongſt us &amp;c. Theſe things being the natural fruits that the conſtitution bears, is the cauſe of the many evils prevailing in the land. Again, Chriſt ſaith Matt. 12.33. Either make the tree good, and his fruit good, or elſe make the tree corrupt, and his fruit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, for the tree is known by its fruit. Now if this conſtitution be a good tree, how comes it to paſs, that it brings forth ſo much corrupt fruit ſince it has been plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this colony? what wickedneſs is there now prevailing in the colony! how much profane ſwearing, not only among the ſeafaring tribe, but town dwellers, and children, and ſervants, black and white, uſing ſuch language enough to make one's fleſh crawl, which I have often heard with my own ears; And how does the ſin of drunkeneſs prevail? men waſting their eſtates and lives with ſtrong liquor! and the ſhameful and dreadful ſin of uncleanneſs among our precious youth, and what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velings and carouſing, ſinging and danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at the ſound of the viol is the youth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged in, both by parents, miniſters and rulers, a practice that the devil glories in, through which he debauches hundreds, &amp;
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:010621_0167_0F81BA444D8A7DE0"/>
deſtroys thouſands, but gloſſes it over with the name of civil recreation; but in truth is right down enmity to God, and leads down to eternal damnation. Again, if this conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo neceſſary to preſerve from ſin, why are the ſubjects of it, ſo carnal &amp; worldly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord's day? I have been informed from time to time, ſince I left that worſhip, that in ſome places it is common for the youth, and ſome heads of families too, to get together on ſabbath day noons, and talk about the world and ſecular things, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this and that news, and to be very light and carnal in going to, and coming from publick worſhip, and young people getting together in companies in the ſtreet, full of vanity on ſabbath evenings, and the body of the people attending ſecular buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs after ſunſet; I ſuppoſe it is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon for people to tackle up their teams a ſabbath evenings, yet as I was in Providence, called to paſs the highway laſt ſabbath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening, I paſſed by a man with his team with a load of apples, I ſuppoſed a going to the cider-mill, and people at work at the cider-mill, all which is contrary to the good and wholeſome laws of this colony, &amp; I think contrary to the laws of God. But where is the authority and under officers in ſuch towns, that have held up their hands
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:010621_0168_0F81BA450D0C31D8"/>
to heaven, and ſolemnly ſwore in the name of the ever living God, to put into executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. I think the day is it hand, when they will ſtand ſpeechleſs before their Judge, unleſs they ſpeedily wake up and repent of their ſinful neglect of duty; and hence forth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to their great duty, as God's miniſters to be a terror to evil doers.</p>
            <p>Again. If the conſtitution is ſuited to preſerve mankind from wickedneſs, whence is it, that the ſubjects of it, are ſo much puffed up with pride, haughtineſs, and vain glory, unmerciful to each other, conſtantly haraſſing each other in the civil law, waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing goods at the ſign-poſt, brother taking brother by the throat, (as it were) as Chriſt calls it, and thruſting one another into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? I might add, the party envy, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered among church members, and in neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoods, and upon ſome occaſions like a ſpreading leproſy, ſpreading through a ſociety, when ſome things are tranſacted that effects mens pride and will; ſuch as ſetting a ſtake to fix the ſpot for a meeting houſe, or in ſeating a meeting-houſe, both which has flung ſocieties into contention and confuſion; notwithſtanding their good conſtitution, which they have to regulate them. Thus I think it is evident, that it does not reach the end propoſed by it.—So
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:010621_0169_0F81BA47637D3480"/>
a fruitleſs thing. Now reader conſider, what propriety is there in the objection? theſe evils are brought forth while the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is in its greateſt glory. And we poor ſeperates that have renounced it, and have nothing to do with it, nor to glory in, but our infirmities are preſerved, from the moſt of theſe evils but no thanks is due to us, but all to free grace, and the plan of God's word, which we endeavour to walk by, and not the plan of this colony. Again. As to the profane ſwearing, and ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-breaking, that is at New-York and Rhode-Iſland. It is not owing to the want of a religious conſtitution that ſuch evils prevail in theſe governments. For accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my obſervation, the Eaſt end of Long Iſland, are as civil, kind, courteous and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious people as any in this colony, and where there is one ſuit at law in their courts, I believe there is fifty at ours. They have no religious conſtitution there eſtabliſhed by civil law; but every one is at liberty to act in religion as they think is moſt plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to their Maker and Redeemer; and that is right, for ſo it ought to be through Chriſtendom. But the cauſe of theſe evils prevailing in theſe governments, is the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal neglect of civil rulers, in putting their wholeſome laws into execution; or
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:010621_0170_0F81BA4833C84190"/>
perhaps unqualified men put into authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, may be no ſmall cauſe of theſe evils pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing. But did civil rulers in any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or colony ſtand in the place where God has called them to ſtand, they would ſoon have God's bleſſing upon their faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful adminiſtring equal juſtice to mankind, and ſo become a terror to evil-doers, and a praiſe to thoſe that do well. Which great bleſſing may the God of ſtrict juſtice, and great mercy, ſpeedily ſend, leſt the land is waſted with their own wickedneſs; for it appears to me, that there is no need of a ſtamp-act to waſte us; our own prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which the land is now in, will do it: their manner of living above themſelves— their making haſte to be rich, and to effect it, undertaking buſineſs that they are not called to; their truſting in trade, and ſuing each other, and underhand dealings, men not regarding their words, and ſuch like. The effects hereof will crumble and waſte the land, without any very ſingular viſitation, unleſs there is a reformation in theſe affairs. And it is my humble opinion, that it would contribute much more to the peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and proſperity of this colony, and to the due honour of our civil rulers, if they would fling up concerning themſelves (as civil ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers) with eccleſiaſtical affairs, what reſpects
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:010621_0171_0F81BA48CC536540"/>
God and conſcience; and let their wiſdom, power, and utmoſt attention be, to plan ſome proper and righteous meaſures, to deliver the people out of their perplexing and diſtreſſing difficulties, that are of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and temporal nature. Here they may work for their great Lord and maſter, get due honor to themſelves, and be a great bleſſing to the colony. Otherwiſe we may expect diviſions to continue of every kind; ruler againſt ruler; people againſt people; waſtings and confuſion in church and ſtate; heavens frowns to abide upon the colony. Pray Moſt High, in thy great wiſdom, power and mercy, prevent theſe great evils falling upon us, and for thy own moſt holy name ſake, graciouſly deliver us from the many evils we are now under, by turning us to thyſelf, by forming thy holy image in our hearts, and thereby bringing us to love the ſupremely, in thy pure, holy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and each other fervently, Amen, ſo be it good God, for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake. Amen.</p>
            <p>Objection 4. You have made a great complaint and out-cry againſt our religious conſtitution, ſaying it deprives you of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of conſcience, and at the ſame time will not allow us liberty of conſcience, for we believe the conſtitution is according to the
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:010621_0172_0F81BA498E1D9DF0"/>
word of God, and we are bound in conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to maintain it, but you in your zeal are labouring to deſtroy it.</p>
            <p>Anſwer. This objection has a plauſible ſhew with it, as tho' I was inconſiſtent with myſelf, and has been the means of caſting dirt in the eyes of many ſeperates in the eaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern parts of the colony. Poor hearts, that are ſo eaſily beguiled (by the cunning craft of men) of their juſt right, and forgot Chriſt's caution in Rev. iii. 11. Behold I come quickly: hold that faſt which thou haſt, that no man take thy crown, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve! theſe perſons have known that the conſtitution comes right a croſs their ſacred rights and privileges; ſo that it is morally impoſible for them in the moſt mildeſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, to aſk their right without ſtriking the conſtitution; altho' they ſhould not ſay one word in their prayer to the aſſembly to put down the conſtitution, yet that which croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes their right, in its own nature, muſt be broke in upon, to give them their right. But to come to the matter in hand. There is no more propriety in the objection, than there would be for an Arian to complain againſt a faithful miniſter of Chriſt, that he denied him his liberty of conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in his doctrine he proved from the ſcriptures, that Jeſus Chriſt was equal God
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:010621_0173_0F81BA4A52EC8B20"/>
with the Father, of the ſame ſubſtance, co-equal, &amp;c. or there would be as much rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for a man that intends to go to heaven, by his legal righteouſneſs, to tell a miniſter of Chriſt, that he denies him liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, becauſe he in the right diſcharge of his duty in preaching, makes it out from ſcripture, that the poor deluded man, upon that bottom, is a going down to hell. Rom. 3.20. Therefore by the deeds of the law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſtified in his ſight. Gal. 3.10. Now conſider, what have I done to deprive my neighbour of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of his conſcience, any otherwiſe than ſhewing from the ſcriptures, the iniquity and unrighteouſneſs of the conſtitution, that it is planned counter to the word of God, and my unalienable right. So that if I have croſſed my neighbour's conſcience, it muſt be an erroneous one, and not a good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. The objector little thinks how much he betrays himſelf, to be in the ſpirit of Saul. Acts 9.1. And Saul yet breathing out &amp;c. Chapt. 26.9. I verily thought with myſelf that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus. Indeed ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience as Saul had, (the truth I have thro' grace held forth) has hurt and gall'd. I think there is too much papiſh blood running in the veins of thoſe that make the objection;
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:010621_0174_0F81BA4B56F12370"/>
to eſtabliſh their religious conſtitution, are obliged to deſtroy, or deprive their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his juſt right, and to uſurp that power that belongs to Chriſt alone; elſe they complain that they have not liberty of conſcience. I think that this is the very caſe of thoſe that make the objection; for the ſum total of what I would, or have done, in this performance, is only to open the gap for the children of men, to have full and free liberty of conſcience, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip God and practice in religion, as they think is agreable to his holy word; and to grant this will in its own nature deſtroy this celebrated conſtitution; and I doubt not but ſome perſons ſee it muſt be ſo, that have reſpect for the conſtitution, and liberty of conſcience too: ſuch perſons would do well rightly to underſtand themſelves, and be conſiſtent with themſelves. Secondly, all the uſe that civil power can be put to, in the whole affair, is, firſt, to force or pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh thoſe that do not conform to the plan, or ſecondly to force thoſe that like the plan to comply with its precepts. Now the firſt is generally denied through the colony, that civil rulers ought not to compel men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their conſciences in the worſhip of God. The ſecond is a paradox indeed, to have the civil rulers with their fines and
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:010621_0175_0F81BA4BD97620A0"/>
priſons, to force men to do that which they like and chuſe to do. Whoever puniſhed himſelf with ſtripes or corporeal pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, unleſs he was a papiſt, or a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted man, for his coming ſhort of what he thought he ſhould do? So that turn the caſe which way you pleaſe, it appears de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively evident, that there is not, nor can not be any civil power rightly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or exerciſed in religious affairs, as ſuch. The written word of God is the only and alone rule of direction in faith and practice. Civil rulers muſt be very preſumptuous and heaven daring to attempt to add or diminiſh from the ſure word of prophecy; and it is morally certain that it is not in their power to force or make men believe in the author of the ſcriptures, or cordially obey its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. Therefore, of neceſſity civil rulers muſt be excluded out of the queſtion, they ought to be content to be where God has placed them, in the civil kingdom. But as to the civil conſtitution of this colony, we eſteem it highly, and in all our memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials to the aſſembly, have ſhewn our ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction therein. Indeed we have ſuffered ourſelves to be defrauded, or to abide under oppreſſion and perſecution, rather than do any thing that ſhould tend to deſtroy the civil conſtitution of the colony. For when
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:010621_0176_0F81BA4C8E3F1458"/>
we had been at great charge and pains to prepare a petition to preſent to the king in council, and ſent two brethren to Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land with it, they informed me, that they adviſed with the moſt knowing and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed counſellors in ſuch affairs, and they told our brethren that it was quite probable, that if our petition had a proper hearing, that it would ſtrike up our charter; for there was ſuch facts done, by the execution of certain laws, the copies of which facts, we had produced from public records, and ſealed with the colony ſeal. Such as theſe, apprehending perſons for preaching the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, for exhortation, for worſhipping God in private houſes, fining and impriſoning for ſuch great chriſtian duties. Wherefore theſe counſellors adviſed our brethren to drop their petition, and come home, and lay the caſe before our churches, and proceed in another method, viz. To ſue a collector, and carry the cauſe through the courts, and go home to England by way of an appeal. They judged that ſuch a method would not endanger the charter like our petition. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which with ſome other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they complied with the advice and came home, and laid the caſe before the the church's committee, and they fell in with advice; having a great value for our civil conſtitution; &amp; if any meaſures could be

attended to introduce us into our ſacred rights of free liberty of conſcience, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our civil privileges, we choſe to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it. Upon which we proſecuted that plan through the courts, and got things almoſt ripe for England, and through ſome fault the cauſe died in the birth. And here we lie under theſe unrighteous eccleſiaſtical laws, till kind providence interpoſe, and appear for our relief. And if our civil ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers (whoſe work it is as God's miniſters) do not appear to give us an equal ſhare of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, with the reſt of our neighbours, they alone will bear it. When he that is in the higheſt heavens, hears the groans that comes up before him, from ſecret places, and the ſighings of the priſoners; his om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcient eye ſees how many briny tears his oppreſſed and perſecuted children eat in their ſtrong cries for mercy, for this colony and land. Wherefore I am prone to think that the time draws near, for Zion's delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, when the Lord Jeſus will awake as one out of ſleep, and like a mighty man that ſhouteth by reaſon of wine, and ſmite his enemies in the hinder parts, and put them to a perpetual reproach, Pſalm 78, 65, 66, read alſo the 68 Pſalm. I further think, that it is too late in the day, for thoſe that know the truth, whether learned, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:010621_0178_0F81BA4E43060858"/>
ruler or not, ſeperate or not, to hold their peace, and think to be neuters, now the battle is pitched in the open field, (not againſt any man's perſon, but againſt ſin, men's inventions and traditions) for the cry is, who is on the Lord's ſide, who, and thoſe that will not come up to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord againſt the mighty; by ſuitably improving all their knowledge, grace and gifts in Chriſt's cauſe, may expect to meet that bitter curſe, Jud. 5.23. Curſe ye Meroz, (ſaith the angel of the Lord) curſe ye bitterly, the inhabitants thereof, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Again. It appears to me, that the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious conſtitution of this colony is a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture of the charter grant, becauſe it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes that oppreſſion and perſecution, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to its firſt intent, and is the direct cauſe of contention and diviſion, which is repugnant to the principal deſign of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting this colony. I will tranſcribe a paſſage out of the charter, which I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be the hinge upon which the whole privileges turn. C. L. B. page 5. <hi>And for the directing, ruling and diſpoſing of all other matters, and things, whereby our ſaid people, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants there may be ſo religiouſly, peaceably, and civilly governed, as their good life, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly converſation may win and invite the natives
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:010621_0179_0F81BA4ECB7D2D68"/>
of the country to the knowledge and obedience of the only true God, and Saviour of mankind, and the chriſtian faith; which in our royal intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the adventurers free profeſſion, is the only and principal and of this plantation.</hi> Thus ſaith the charter. Pray reader remember, that it was well known by the grantors, what our fore-fathers left England for; that they could not ſubmit to the religious conſtitution of the nation: but choſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh all their civil and natural rights in England, and venture all the hardſhips of a wilderneſs ſtate in the midſt of a cruel and ſavage enemy, principally, and ſolely for the free liberties and privileges of the goſpel, where there was no religious conſtitution to interrupt the ſacred rights of conſcience. Pray mind the words of the grant—<hi>and the adventurers free profeſſion is the only and principal end of this plantation</hi>— Now I think right reaſon ſaith, that if this free profeſſion be the only and principal end of this colony, then when that princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal end is taken away and deſtroyed, then the privileges of the colony is forfeited and gone. And that this free profeſſion is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and gone in this colony, ever ſince this religious conſtitution has been eſtabliſhed, my writing ſhews, as the ſun-beams at noon day; alſo the daily practice of this colony
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:010621_0180_0F81BA4F9CCB6238"/>
according to their conſtitution. Witneſs, young deacon Drake of Windſor, now in Hartford priſon, for the miniſters rates and building their meetinghouſe, altho' he is a baptiſt, (chriſtians renouncing their infant or former baptiſm, is a practice I utterly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as unſcriptural, an error in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment attended with many ſnares, Prov. 20.25) yet notwithſtanding he has made this miſtake, he is accounted a harmleſs, godly man; and he has plead the privilege of a baptiſt, through all the courts, and been at great expence, without relief, till at laſt the aſſembly has given him a mark in his hand; and notwithſtanding this, they have thruſt him to priſon for former rates, with ſeveral aggravations, which I ſhall omit. But as to what the conſtitution does to relieve the poor deacon, he may there die, and the cry of blood, blood, go up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ears of a juſt God, who will e're long avenge the wrongs done to the innocent, by this murderous conſtitution, that will ſhew no mercy. The civil law makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion to ſupport criminals in priſon; alſo ſuppoſeth that debtors have eſtate, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to pay their juſt dues, but in caſe they are actually reduced to poverty, the poor man's oath gives them relief. But in this caſe, the civil law has made no proviſion to ſave life; for it is a caſe of conſcience, and <pb n="184" facs="unknown:010621_0181_0F81BA50598C8318"/>
all the money upon the face of the earth cannot buy a pardon for conſcience, when it is defiled with ſin; and the ſcripture ſaith, whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin; and no ſeperate that can go to priſon for a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's rate, can pay the ſame in belief, it is duty, or according to the rule of God's word. Therefore here they are to ſtarve or freeze, as to what the conſtitution has done to ſave life. It is is true, they have been preſerved, and provided for, that have been put into priſon in Chriſt's cauſe; the Moſt High has been very gracious and merciful to them, in providing relief, in great ſtraits; their very enemies have miniſtred to their neceſſities in my certain knowledge: but no thanks due to the conſtitution. I will endeavour to give a ſhort narrative of the trial and experience of a man, that I have had ſome acquaintance with, who ſome years ago, when in a low ſtate of health, was put into Hartford priſon, for his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's rate, who conſcientiouſly had left the miniſter for ſome years, upon point of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. He was confined in a cold turn of weather in January, and he was put were he could not have a fire, nor cloaths ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to preſerve him from the cold, he walked in the priſon chamber to keep his blood in circulation, to preſerve life, till he was almoſt ready to drop on the floor, &amp;
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:010621_0182_0F81BA510C146840"/>
there die; when he caſt his eyes round up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the priſon walls, there he read death, death, as real as ever he ſaw it in a dying perſon's, corpſe or grave. His diſtreſs was to be ſecured from the cold. He put up his deſires to heaven, as he walk'd, that the merciful God would find out ſome way in his kind providence, to preſerve life; he ſeeing no way how he could be preſerved from the cold, was over borne with diſtreſs for ſome way to preſerve life. He repaired to one corner of the priſon and in ſecret prayer, poured our his deſires to that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful God, which heareth the groans of the priſoners, in which duty he ſaw the cauſe he was ſuffering in, was God's cauſe, in which he might venture life and all. But before he got through his prayer, his mind was ſeized with ſerenity, a divine calm; all fear of freezing was gone, yet no informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the underſtanding, which way he ſhould have relief; ſo he remained ſome ſpace of time; till exerciſing his thoughts how he ſhould be relieved, and ſeeing no way, diſtreſs came on his mind again, as hard as ever, for he found his ſtrength was almoſt gone, that he could not walk much longer; that he muſt by and by reſign, and let the cold, and grim death do its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; and as he again caſt his eyes round the priſon—death, death, preſented itſelf on all
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:010621_0183_0F81BA52AC1C9270"/>
ſides; no way could he ſee for relief, unleſs a miracle was wrought to preſerve him— but he tho't that he would once more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to a corner of the priſon, and pour out his ſoul to God, that he would in his great mercy, find out ſome way for relief, and whilſt he was lifting up his heavy heart to God, and eating his briny tears; behold his mind was ſeized again as before, with a heavenly calm; all fear of freezing gone, a ſweet divine peace, and ſerenity of ſoul, and ſo cloſed his prayer with bleſſing and praiſing God, for giving him relief in his mind; and ſet down, muſing and thinking, what he ſhould learn by ſuch operations, it being ſuch an experience as he never had before, in the circumſtance of it, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in the mind, and no way opened to the underſtanding, how, and whilſt his mind was exerciſed thereupon. The caſe of Jeremiah, who was likely to periſh in the dungeon, was brought to his mind; the whole of which may be read in Jer. 37, 38, chap. But the 20th ver. in the 37 chap. paſſing through his mind, viz. Therefore, hear now, I pray thee, O my Lord the king, let my ſupplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee, that thou cauſe me not to return to the houſe of Jonathan the ſcribe, leſt I die there. Now whilſt he was thinking on what inſtructions he could get
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:010621_0184_0F81BA534C936410"/>
from this text; the next verſe was brought freſh in his mind, viz. Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Jeremiah into the court of the priſon. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the priſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—Upon the whole, and in ſhort, the perſon got this inſtruction, viz. That Jeremiah was perſecuted for the truth, and likely to die in the dungeon, and his life, then under God, was in the king's hand, &amp; that it was the king's great duty, as a ruler and miniſter of God, to relieve Jeremiah, and he had a juſt right to beſeech and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the king to releive him, and ſave his life; upon which the perſon ſee that his own life under God, in that ſtraight, was in the priſon keeper's hands; he had power to relieve him, or let him freeze to death there. He had a cloſe examination of his heart, to ſee what motions governed him in ſeeking relief, whether it was not to ſhun the croſs. But to his great comfort, he found a meaſure of uprightneſs prevailing in him. No diſpoſition to ſhift a hair from the naked truth. He ſee it his duty to get liberty, to tell the priſon-keeper an honeſt ſtory; juſt as things appeared to him, and to deſire liberty to lie by his fire, in order to preſerve life; and if granted the favour, it would be the Lord's doing's; but if he denied the requeſt, and ordered
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:010621_0185_0F81BA57715C0068"/>
back to his chamber, where he then was, the perſon felt in his ſoul a ſurrendery to the ſovereignty of God, and dropped at his foot, and gave up his life upon the very ſpot; and ſaid amen, the will of the Lord be done. This and much more did the perſon experience. Upon this he uſed means to get liberty to ſpeak with the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon-keeper (who was then confined to a ſick bed) and the favour was granted—he acquainted the priſon-keeper with his caſe, juſt as he underſtood it; and aſked the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to lie by his fire, at firſt no anſwer was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, only the priſon-keeper tried to perſuade the ſeperate to pay his rate, &amp; go home, and not deny himſelf of his privileges and expoſe his life. So he reſted calm in his mind with his heart affected, with the goodneſs of the Lord, that he could warm himſelf at the fire, about the ſpace of a quarter of an hour (if I remember right) then the priſon-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er gave his conſent, that he might lie by his fire that night, which was all that the poor priſoner then requeſted; for he knew not what a night, or day would bring forth. But from that time forward, all the while, he was at priſon, he was as the text ſaith, in the court of the priſon, never was lock't up more, but had the liberty from the garret to the celler, and had the liberty to pray and ſing with his chriſtian friends, under that

part of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> that the priſon-keeper liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in; when at other times he has been like a raging madman againſt the ſaints, when they have been praying and ſinging in the priſon, lock't up in their own room &amp;c. Now this perſon's deliverance from priſon is alſo worthy of notice; as I was informed by a perſon of undoubted credit, who was perſonally acquainted with the affair, which is as followeth. When this ſeperate was carried to priſon, there was a man that lived in that neighbourhood, there at the priſon a tipling with his cups, that uſed to be the worſe for liquor from morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to night when he could get it; and a bitter enemy to the ſeperates, has threatened to knock his wife's brains out for going a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the ſeperates. But ſeeing the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor put this perſon into priſon, ſeized this man's conſcience, he went home con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of his own wicked practice or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much, broke it off, was never ſeen in liquor whilſt the ſeperate remained in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; confeſſed his fault to his wife for drinking too much, and ſpending ſo much money for ſtrong drink, when (ſaid he) there is a good man in priſon, that has hurt no body, confined and ſuffering for the miniſters rate, when I have ſpent ſo much money for ſtrong drink, and abuſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with it. Alſo he confeſſed his fault for
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:010621_0187_0F81BA595BEAB698"/>
abuſing his wife, for going to hear the ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, and promiſed that he never would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and gave her liberty to go when ſhe thought fit: he tried to get his neighbours to join with him and pay the rate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe the man, but to no purpoſe. He viſited the perſon in priſon ſeveral times, to contrive ſome way to get him out; indeed according to the account, the man was in horror in his conſcience all the time the innocent ſeperate was confined, which was more than a fortnight, at length he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his hand labour, eight pounds of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, old tenor, and unbeknown to his wife or any body elſe but the priſon keeper, he went and paid the priſon-keeper's whole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which was above ſeven pounds of the money he had received, and ordered the priſon-keeper to let the ſeperate go home, upon which he was releaſed, but the priſon-keeper would not tell him by what means, neither did the perſon know till ſome time after. Thus reader the earth helped the woman, Rev. 12.16. This narrative may ſerve to encourage and ſtrengthen thoſe that love Chriſt's cauſe more than their worldly intereſt or their own life; alſo to convict and ſhame thoſe that dare not truſt the Lord with their ſubſtance and lives, but to ſave them both, pay the collector his demands, and that in a grudging man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:010621_0188_0F81BA5A32AE80A8"/>
and have no peace with God, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in their doings. But to cloſe this narrative. I would let the reader know the end of this man, that was ſo bountiful to the ſeperate. After he had releaſed the Lord's priſoner, the poor man by little and little, took to his cups like the dog to his vomit, till he had finiſhed his race, and doubtleſs died in his ſins. But I will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the point I was upon, ſhewing wherein it appears to me, that this conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution in the force and cruelty that it exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes over mens conſciences, is a forfeiture of the charter grant. Pray mind the words of the grant, viz. "ſo religiouſly, peaceably and civilly governed, as their good life &amp; orderly converſation may win and invite the natives of the country to the knowledge &amp; obedience of the only true God, and ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of mankind, &amp;c." Now dear reader think ſeriouſly of the converſation, practice and government which this conſtitution ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes over mens conſciences and property in religious things; and judge ye, what influence can ſuch a practice have upon the heathen, to win and invite them to the knowledge and obedience of the only true God, or Jeſus Chriſt. Indeed it appears to me, that nothing hardly, is more likely to prejudice the heathen againſt the peaceful goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt and the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:010621_0189_0F81BA5AE7E1BF50"/>
than ſuch a practice; and to leave them under the ſtrong deluſions of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil to believe a lie, that they might be damned. Yea I believe a Turk, to look on and ſee what this conſtitution power has done among us, ſince the firſt out power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's ſpirit, would rather be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the belief of Alcoran, and laugh and ſmile, to ſee a people profeſſing to be good chriſtians, thus treating one another. But to cloſe all reſpecting this religous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and to make up my want in tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every rag of covering off, that the thigh of it, may be quite naked and bare: I would join to this book, the renowned <hi>Locke's Letter on Toleration;</hi> in which my mind is expreſſed, beyond what my poor weak abilities is able to demonſtrate. Join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this letter with my performance, makes a compleat joint, a uniform plan in the whole: not that I mean to equal myſelf with Locke, no, by no means: but the cauſe of truth and equity, and the juſt rights of all men, that I have in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner endeavoured to plead, he has abundantly eſtabliſhed and confirmed, by ungainſaying arguments: through which means his fame and name is had in great eſteem in many kingdoms, (as I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.) And whoever of my readers ſhall think that my writing tends to hurt
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:010621_0190_0F81BA5BD5E7AE68"/>
the church or ſtate, (which indeed is not my deſign) I earneſtly beg the favour of ſuch, to get Locke's Letter, and peruſe it calmly and thoroughly, through which means perhaps, you may think, more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable upon what I am ſtriving (under God) to have effected, and brought about. Alſo I would earneſtly requeſt of all, ſuch as are true Briton's and chriſtians, that ſet a high value upon liberty of conſcience, that they move forward to get Locke's Letter re-printed, two thouſand of them is now wanted in this colony, as a means to let light into the underſtanding, that the people may ſee where their ſtanding now is; alſo what they ſhould be as to goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel liberty. What will all our temporal liberty do us, if we be deprived of the moſt important liberty, which reſpects our ſouls future and eternal being? &amp;c. Again I would recommend to my readers ſerious peruſal a Book intituled, <hi>A ſeaſonable plea for the liberty of conſcience, and the right of private judgment in matters of religion, without any controul from human authority.</hi> This book was doubtleſs wrote to uncover the religous conſtitution of this colony. Alſo I would recommend to my readers ſerious peruſal a book entituled, <hi>A ſhort view of the difference between the church of Chriſt, and the eſtabliſhed churches in the colony of Connecticut.</hi>
               <pb n="194" facs="unknown:010621_0191_0F81BA5C50D6B6F8"/>
Wrote by <hi>Solomon Paine,</hi> paſtor of the church of Chriſt in <hi>Canterbury.</hi> This book I underſtand is much diſpiſed by the body of this generation. Yet he being dead, yet ſpeaketh. And the true witneſs that he has given in the book, in my humble opinion, will ſooner or later, roar like thunder in the conſciences of thoſe that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe it; and be like mountains of lead, to ſink ſuch diſpiſers down under the wrath of God, who finally reject the truth. The Moſt High has condeſcended to ſpeak heavy things to Connecticut, through that inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; who I firmly believe is now bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the throne of God and the Lamb, crying grace, grace, worthy is the Lamb that was ſlain, &amp;c. What remains for me to do in this peice, is to give ſome advice, council, caution and warning, to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this colony; And if my dear fellow countrymen, neighbours and friends, would heartily fall in therewith, I doubt not but Connecticut would ſee better times, than ever they have yet ſeen, both in church &amp; ſtate.</p>
            <p>Firſt then in general. My earneſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt in all humility, is to all rational per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that have ſouls to ſave or looſe; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther high or low, rich or poor, male or female, old or young, free or bond. That you take into ſerious and cloſe conſideration,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:010621_0192_0F81BA5D1E67C488"/>
what a caſe your ſouls are now in—whether converted or not—whether careleſs and ſtupid about death, and the final judgment, or earneſtly concerned to be prepared there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for. I earneſtly adviſe you to ſearch the ſcriptures daily; for they are able to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint you with yourſelves, thro' the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit's help, and to make you wiſe to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; ſee that you don't read careleſsly, nor out of cuſtom, or only to furniſh your heads, to talk better than your neighbours; but principally in the conſideration that it is the word of the ever-living God, by which you muſt be ſaved or damn'd: and keep in mind always, when you take the bible in your hands, that it is the command of Chriſt, John 5, 39. That you read with that care and attention, as not to let the word ſlip: but thro' the ſcriptures obtain the knowledge of him, whom to know a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, is life eternal. Mind what Chriſt ſaith, Mat. 6.33. But ſeek ye firſt the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let the matter reſt, till you know whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are converted or not. John 3, 3. Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God. Know reader, that if you are not new-born again, made holy in heart, your
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:010621_0193_0F81BA5DD78C1768"/>
caſe is dreadful; there is no peace belongs to you, night nor day, Iſa, 48.22. There is no peace ſaith the Lord, unto the wicked. John 3, 18. But he that believeth not, is condemned already. Ver. 36. And he that believeth not the Son, ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on him. Pray ſee your caſe deſcribed by Chriſt himſelf; and ſure I am, it is no caſe to be eaſy in; for you know not how ſoon the avenger of blood will over-take you, for you are ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and deſpiſers of the blood of Chriſt, all the while you remain out of Chriſt, ſecure in your ſins. Death you know is certain, and as to you, the time very uncertain. What, if that grim meſſenger ſhould lay his cold hand upon you to-night, or to-morrow, and you be found out of Chriſt? Nothing then, my dear friends, but an eternal hell of immenſe wrath, of a dreadful ſin-reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, to be your endleſs portion! no, not a drop of water to cool your inflamed tongue a whole eternity! O, eternity, eternity, of unmixed wrath, and divine vengeance, where there cannot be a drop of mercy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the poor loſt ſinner! Read for your awakening, Luke 16, 19, to the end. Therefore my dear friends, into whoſe hands theſe lines may fall, ſuffer me to get your conſent, and prevail with you, now this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, without delay to engage in your ſoul's
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:010621_0194_0F81BA5E97C60B58"/>
concerns. Make ſure of an intereſt in Chriſt above all things; and know that your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, prayers, tears, nor any thing done by you, cannot recommend you to a holy God. And if you are ever ſaved, it muſt and will be by rich and free grace. Eph. 2.8.9. For by grace are ye ſaved, through faith, and that not of yourſelves, it is the gift of God. Not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt. Now if the children of men could be perſuaded in earneſt to attend upon thoſe duties God requires in his word, thro' which he works by his free ſpirit, and not reſt in their duties; but follow on to know the Lord, (Hoſ. 7.3.) till they obtain through free grace the ſaving knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt. What a bleſſed and vaſt alteration ſhould we have in the land for the better! And how would party prejudice, ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and mens tradition, be laid aſide; when every one looked to God and the ſcriptures, to find the way to eternal life! Now it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together juſt and reaſonable, that all perſons ſhould be ſo engaged to know the truth as it is in Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. And to be more particular. Firſt, my earneſt deſire is, that every individual head of a family, would wake up, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider, what the Moſt High re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of you in that relation; how careful and upright you ſhould be in all your civil
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:010621_0195_0F81BA5F4CBF9C60"/>
dealings, in the whole of your practice; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver mind the law, which you and I muſt by and by be tried by. Mat. 7.12. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, all things, whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them, for this is the law and the prophets. Secondly, conſider the religious duties in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon you in your families, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to them conſtantly; always keeping in mind the neceſſity of the Lord's help in all duties, in cloſet prayer, family prayer, daily reading the ſcriptures in your family; alſo inſtructing &amp; catechiſing your houſhold, frequently inſtructing them in the eſſential doctrines of the goſpel; living in a ſerious, godly converſation, ſuch as miniſters grace to the hearer. Read for your help theſe texts, Deut. 4 9.10. chap. 6 to 9. Titus 2.2 to 6, 1 Pet. 1, 15. 2 Pet. 3.11. The neglect of theſe duties is one of the great ſins of the times. Family prayer is much drop'd in the land (if I have been informed right) more eſpecially in populous towns; and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily inſtruction more ſo. What a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſinful caſe is it, that there is ſo many prayerleſs heads of families! Poor miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble creatures! who live as if there was no God, no heaven, nor hell. The very hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then idolaters that worſhip ſtocks and ſtones, and devils, will riſe up in the judgment day to condemn ſuch prayerleſs perſons; they never had the means to know the true and
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:010621_0196_0F81BA60739BF9A0"/>
proper object of prayer, but you have, that reſtrain prayer before God. Poor hearts! what ſhall I write to you—you live as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out God in the world—your practice ſaith, that you are Atheiſts, and that you are ſelf-ſufficient, and can ſubſiſt and preſerve your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and families, through your own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent ſtrength, power and wiſdom; only as you expect to meet with fate and chance. Read your character and doom, Rom. 1. 28, to the end. Jer. 10, 25.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. Labour to get the true knowledge of that rule and government that your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker requires you to ſtand in, and exerciſe daily in your families. The ſcriptures give you ſufficient direction in your duty; read for your help the following paſſages, Gen. 18, 19. Prov. 19, 18. chap. 22, 6. chap. 23.13 14. ch. 29, 19. Col. 3, 17, to the end, chap. 4. 1. Eph. 6, 1 to 9. What a beautiful good and raviſhing ſight it would be, to ſee a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily well ordered and governed: the man in his place, in right government from Love to God, and his dear family.—The woman in dutiful ſubjection to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.—The children and ſervants knowing and abiding in their place, watching the word of command, chearfully complying therewith, without murmuring or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, or one child turning off the duty to another. Heads of families ſhould ſee
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:010621_0197_0F81BA60F379DB40"/>
that they they require of their children, what is needful to be done; and then let their word be as a ſtanding fixed law in their family, and ſee that it is duly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The right ſort of government has not a great deal of whipping in it, but firſt inſtruction, counſel and caution is uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly, and the ordinance of the rod, is the laſt, and when that muſt be uſed, it ſhould be done effectually, out of pure du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and in a praying frame of ſpirit; and without doubt, it will have the bleſſing of heaven attend it, for good, &amp;c. Some of my zealous neighbours and their teachers, ſay, That the ſeperates are the cauſe of the judgments of God upon the land. But the time is at hand, when doubtleſs they will know otherwiſe, to their ſurpriſe: if I may ſhew my opinion in the caſe, I muſt ſay, irreligious, prayerleſs families, wicked, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed families is the principal cauſe of the calamities of the times, (next to the oppoſition made againſt the work and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in the land) as good family go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is an exceeding great bleſſing to church and ſtate; ſo the criminal neglect thereof tends to the ruin and deſtruction of both. The ſhameful and ſinful neglect of family government, is one of the crying ſins of theſe degenerate times; it forebodes an overthrow to church and ſtate, unleſs kind
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:010621_0198_0F81BA618B8441E8"/>
heaven interpoſe in great mercy, by the out-pouring of God's holy Spirit, which this colony, as a people, have hitherto deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed. But it is high time for them to wake up to purpoſe, and ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to know what the Holy Spirit's work and office is; that if the Higheſt ſhould ſtoop ſo low, as once more to pour out his Spirit upon this land, they might happily know it, and be ſharers in its ſaving influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. But who can tell the dreadfuls the land is now groaning under, by reaſon of the criminal neglect of family government. How are our precious youth ruined, inſtead of their being trained up for heaven, to be a generation of God's praiſe, they are trained up in the way that leads down to hell! and without ſpeedy repentance, are like to be a generation of God's dreadful wrath. For what liberty have they to go on in revelling and banquetting, chambering and wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſinging and dancing at the ſound of the viol. Alſo the youth, if not heads of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, clubing together, to play cards, curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſwearing, drinking to exceſs, and committing uncleanneſs from time to time; out at all ſeaſons in the night; the young men and women upon the bed together, an allowed practice, by many heads of fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, thus to ſuffer their children to be in the way of temptation; and no marvel that
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:010621_0199_0F81B9CACC8AD4A8"/>
an angry jealous God gives up the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous youth to commit uncleanneſs with gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs. But I deſpare of good times in this land or colony, ſeperate or not, if family religion and inſtruction and government is not ſet up in the midſt of us. Indeed this generation is got ſo relaxed and remote from the thing, that if the head of a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comes pretty near the rule in governing his houſe, he is ſingled out from the reſt of his neighbours, and counted almoſt as cruel as a Turk—they cry he will ſpoil all his children, and make them mopes, not fit for ſociety, they ſay, &amp;c. I confeſs it is likely they will be accompliſhed with ſo many excellent, moral vertues, and ſuch common grace and modeſty, that they will no ways ſuit the ungovern'd ribble rabble, the carnal and profane. Alſo, if grand ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors may be indulged neglecting their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and when they endeavour to attend their office, and make preſentment accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to law, and the authority be indulged with taking no notice of their preſentments, then farewel good times from this colony and land, and prepare for your day of heavy viſitation.</p>
            <p>A word to my brethren in this reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. There is too many of you greatly wanting in this great duty of governing your families aright. Suffer me to entreat
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:010621_0200_0F81B9CC113ECF68"/>
you for the Lord's ſake, and your own and families good, to wake up in earneſt, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for a full acquaintance with your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in your families; alſo for ſanctifying grace, to practiſe in your knowledge. How ſhort do you come of living up to your light! neglecting your duties in your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, betrays the cauſe of Chriſt; his high &amp; holy name is reproached thro' your ſinful neglect. More is juſtly expected from you, in walking in right rules, than from your neighbours: Therefore watch and pray al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways. Labour to train up your children for heaven; uſing all proper ſcriptural means to get a portion for them in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God; and that will be better for them than all the world beſide. I cloſe this head, by turning my reader to that ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtance of God's holineſs and jealouſy manifeſted againſt good old Eli, for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſneſs in governing his houſe, uſing words only, when ſeverer government was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the good of his ſons; which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect brought the curſe of God upon his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily forever. Therefore, dearly beloved brethren, take warning that you do not through your neglect of duty bring down the curſe of a jealous God upon your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious children, to the lateſt poſterity. 1 Sam. 3, 13. For I have told him, that I will judge his houſe forever, for the iniquity
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:010621_0201_0F81B9CC4D589C58"/>
which he knoweth; becauſe his ſons made themſelves vile, and he reſtrained them not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, I would earneſtly intreat ſuch as are freemen, to wake up, and ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, of what great importance it is, for the peace, health and proſperity of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, that ſuch men are choſen into public offices and rule, as are ſuitably qualified therefor. I think it is a right and ſafe way of proceeding in ſuch caſes. Firſt to take into cloſe conſideration, the work neceſſary to be done. Secondly, conſider the gifts &amp; qualifications neceſſary to perform that work called for. Thirdly, ſee where the man or men ſo accompliſhed, with ſuch qualifications are; them are the men, that God ſaith in his word &amp; providence ſhould be put into office over you. It matters not what denomination they are of, as to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, if they be ſolid good ſuitable men. Alſo that you ever keep in mind, in your choice of rulers, to introduce ſuch as have a ſpecial gift of Government. Not men that are proud, haughty; or high-ſpirited, ſoon angry; they are not fit for rulers; but men that are of a ſteady, ſolid, reſolute mind, whoſe face is as flint to do ſtrict and equal juſtice, intirely leaving their honour and profit to the diſpoſal of their Lord and Maſter; and who are as deaf as an adder to all flattery &amp; frowns; and wield theſ word
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:010621_0202_0F81B9CD0C265230"/>
of juſtice aright; thruſting it into the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of all ſin and wickedneſs, that falls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their juriſdiction. To have men in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil government, that have not the gift of government, is one of God's heavy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon a people. See Iſa. 3.4. And I will give children to be their princes, &amp; babes ſhall rule over them. Ver. 12. As for my people, children are their oppreſſors, and women rule over them: O my peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, they which lead thee, cauſe thee to err, and deſtroy the way of thy paths. How much this reſpects our times, is well for all ſeriouſly to conſider.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. I ſhall beg liberty with all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, humbly to addreſs our civil rulers in this colony, as followeth. In as much as I am warranted from the word of God, to intreat elders whether in age or office. 1. Tim. 5.1. Therefore I earneſtly intreat, that you would duly conſider that the beſt of you are liable to miſtakes, as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men. Liable to proceed in enacting laws, and putting the ſame into execution, without duly, and underſtandingly, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering whether they are conſonant with the written word of God; for I preſume that it is the fixed principle of our honourable and general aſſembly, to enact no laws re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the word of God. Therefore that you may be conſiſtent with yourſelves,
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:010621_0203_0F81B9D10378EA80"/>
you well know, it becomes you to be well acquainted with the written word of God, to know the bounds that your great Lord and Maſter has ſet you; otherwiſe how can you know, whether your acts and decrees, will comport with your directions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from? Pray be pleaſed to take into cloſe conſideration your eccleſiaſtical laws, well conſider them in their own nature, and then let your utmoſt attention be to the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, well conſidering who they have pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be lord of conſcience, and the ſole dictator and director in all religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and how the ſame is ſupported, lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your religous worſhip by the ſcriptures, will give you the advantage, (if your minds are upright) to ſee whether your plan is according to the ſcriptures, or not.</p>
            <p>And poſſibly if you could in a calm ſedate mind, peruſe what is in this piece wrote thereupon, you may obtain ſome light, to ſee the diſagreement that is between the ſcriptures and your religious plan; and ſo conclude that through ſome means or other, before your day, theſe eccleſiaſtical laws was introduced, before they had got a foundation for their being from the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and if ſo, then conſequently it muſt be for your honour, and the peace and comfort of this colony, to make them null and void. Indeed ſirs, I think conſiſtent
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:010621_0204_0F81B9D1A52EBCE0"/>
with your principles, you cannot ſtep one ſtep further, in putting them into executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before you ſee their warrant from the word of God; and if you do not, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume no man will be hurt by them any more. With all ſubmiſſion ſuffer me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind you of your ſolemn oaths, in which with your lifted up hands to the omniſcient God, you ſwear by the ever living God, to promote the public good and peace of this colony, and will further the execution of juſtice for the time aforeſaid, according to the rules of God's word, and the laws of this colony. Your honors well know that the word of God is prior to our colony laws, the later but as yeſterday, and the former from eternity; and it is upon this belief, I ſuppoſe, that you diſpence with that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the C. L. B. p. 139, "Nor ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons neglect the public worſhip of God, in ſome lawful congregation, and form themſelves into ſeperate companies in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate houſes, on penalty of ten ſhillings," &amp;c. Becauſe you ſee this is counter to the word of God, ſo cannot be of any force; and if this be not the caſe, it is beyond me to ſay, how you do to diſpence with your neglect, for this twenty years, &amp;c. But I am obliged in charity to conclude, that you know that this branch of law, has got <hi>mene tekel</hi> written upon it: and if ſo, why does
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:010621_0205_0F81B9D2E2BB3858"/>
it ſtand there for wicked men to uſe, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their malice and ſpit againſt the poor ſeperates that mean to hurt no-body, but only keep a chaſte conſcience in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the living and true God, as they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand his mind in his written word. I am prone to think, that it would make the honorable aſſembly bluſh to hear a true narrative of what was tranſacted at Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingford, upon a few ſeperates in proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this law. I will endeavour to give a brief hint, as I had it from the perſons had up—which is as followeth,—</p>
            <p>A wicked man in that neighbourhood, went to his peculiar friend, a petty lawyer, who drew a complaint againſt the ſeperates; he took it, and went to a juſtice of peace, who was abed, and got him up, and the juſtice ſigned the inſtrument, and off he goes with it to an officer, which undertook the work. He gets ſome of the ſimple neighbours to aſſiſt the officer, and a negro wench to be the Judas to lead the band; for ſhe knew where the perſons lay, and by this time it got to be about midnight; they marched to the firſt houſe, enters the ſame, and ſeizes the man and his wife a-bed, and ſecures them; and then went to the next houſe, and to get into the houſe, the negro wench frames and tells a lye, and ſo by that means enters with the band; the mother
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:010621_0206_0F81B9D32CEE9810"/>
of the young women perceived ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with the wench, and called her two or three times, to come into the room where ſhe and her huſband was a-bed, and not go into the room to diſturb the girls, for ſhe thought that there was ſome evil going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; but the wench did not mind her; but led the band thro' two or three doors, and entred the room where was two or three young women faſt aſleep, in two beds; they had no light, but went feeling about the beds to find the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; two of them told me, that the firſt that they perceived, was a hand upon their ſhoulder, and a voice ſaying, by virtue of this, you are my priſoner—the firſt was much ſurpriſed, the reſt ſoon underſtood what was going forward. By this time they call for a light; but the woman of the houſe forbid their lighting a candle there; the negro wench (which it ſeems was the right hand man among them) went to a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's houſe, and got a light, and the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer read his warrant: but the poor man was ſomething in the caſe of Beelſhazzer, when he ſaw the hand-writing upon the wall, he trembled ſo, and in ſuch a ſurpriſe, that he could not read his inſtrument right; one of the young women was obliged to tell him. After he had ſerved his warrant, he ſet keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers over the young women all night, and
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:010621_0207_0F81B9D3CDA63B70"/>
ſo departed, til the morning—morning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing come, the officer carrys his priſoners before the authority: But, behold! the old gentleman was ſadly ſurpriſed, to ſee a company of girls brought before him; for it ſo happened that the juſtice never read the inſtrument, that he ſigned the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and was ignorant of the affair til now. He ſent for more authority to ſit in council with him, upon this new ſurpriſing buſineſs, which buſineſs proved too mighty for them all; for the wicked man that made the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, was no man in law, to proſecute ſuch an action; elſe likely they would have made ſomething out; (I am prone to think had that authority underſtood their work as God's miniſters, to ſcreen and protect the innocent, and puniſh the wicked, they would have frowned upon that wicked man, and all that was aiding and helping with him) but nothing of this nature; but vaſtly to the contrary, for they kept them inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent perſons months exerciſed in the affair, before they dropt the action—adjourned the court, and adjourned it, til it died. But beſides all this, this ſame wicked man (not having anſwered his malicious deſigns) forms two more vexatious lawſuits, againſt thoſe ſame innocent perſons, one for theft, another for ſlander, makes one of them a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cauſe, through their craft, in order
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:010621_0208_0F81B9D48CEAF220"/>
to caſt the charge upon theſe ſeperates; and in the midſt of this wickedneſs, he is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for breaking the king's peace, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the lives of his neighbours; laying violent hands on one of theſe young women, and blood came out of her mouth and noſe, and ſhe ſwore the peace againſt him—yet he is ſuffered to carry on his deſign, to his mind, in ſome meaſure; for he entred his action with that authority which it is likely ſuited him to a notch; that wanted no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence but what was in his own breaſt, to condemn the poor ſeperates. But it ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in kind providence that they got a lawyer from New-Haven, that was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs helped by God, to plead the cauſe of the innocent. Otherwiſe it is likely, the court would have condemned them. But after the authority had kept theſe priſoners in cuſtody four days, (if I don't miſtake) and treated them with all contempt, ſcorn and ſlander, the court was adjourned twice, and in the cloſe nothing was made out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe perſons, altho' this wicked man got near twenty evidences; but the court, by his own declaration had more in his breaſt againſt the priſoners, than all them evidences, and ſo made a bill of coſt againſt them, which was above 3 pounds. Theſe ſeperates did not underſtand the law, about the charge, and they underſtood that their
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:010621_0209_0F81B9D54DF21180"/>
antagoniſt had other actions planning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, and they was ſatisfied how they ſhould go before that authority, and ſee no end to charges ariſing: therefore deſired ſome ſpace of time to conſider of it—but the authority would allow them none; but ordered them forthwith to priſon; it being ſome in the evening, the conſtable put them under keepers that night, and the next day carried them off to New-Haven, in two horſe carts, a man and four young women, (but it happened ſo that they had no halter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their necks) and put them in priſon, where they lay four days, in which time they found ſeveral friends, who gave them advice, and by engaging to pay the charges, which was about five pounds lawful, they was releaſed from priſon, &amp;c. I have given but a ſhort ſketch of the affair—it would contain ſome ſheets of paper to give the whole. I ſhall leave the reader to judge for himſelf, about the whole affair, &amp; think for myſelf; and I think ſuch a practice brings a blot and a ſcandal upon the whole colony, to put, or ſuffer ſuch men to be in public authority, whoſe practice cannot be equaled a this ſide the Spaniſh inquiſition. For honeſt ſober perſons, that never have hurt, nor havs no deſign to harm any body, to be ſeized at midnight, aſleep in their beds, and dealt with in form and manner,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:010621_0210_0F81B9D60DE5BD40"/>
as has been done to them; for nothing elſe but worſhipping God, as they really think is according to his mind and will: alſo for their endeavouring to live according to the direction in God's word. I ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly think, if ſuch a practice is allowed, or ſuch authority is kept in their poſts in this colony, the name or Connecticut will ſtink in the noſtrails of all true proteſtants thro' this kingdom, and as far as ſuch conduct is known, in the reformed nations. Pray think, how does ſuch a practice comport with the charter grant, that requires a religious &amp; peaceable government, to ſeize the king's peaceable ſubjects at midnight, aſleep in their bed's, for nothing but worſhipping God? But you may excuſe yourſelves and ſay wicked men has done it. Be it ſo; but do not let us lay more to them than belongs to them—take away the wicked conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and wicked men will have no ſuch a foundation to work upon. What if a grand juror, a lawful officer, had entered the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, what is there in the conſtitution to hinder him doing his office at midnight, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more than at mid-day; if he will riſk his own credit, the conſtitution will bear him out as well at midnight, as at noon-day.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. I think it well becomes the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able aſſembly, according to your character, and dignity, to be much in ſearching the
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:010621_0211_0F81B9D71CE59540"/>
ſcriptures, which are able to furniſh you with all needed wiſdom, to examine thoſe laws, which are already enacted, and more eſpecially, in as much as your oath obliges you to act according to God's word; and what laws is not for the health, peace and proſperity of the whole, or repugnant to the word of God, pray let them be repealed; and enact what may be wanting for the health and happineſs of the whole.</p>
            <p n="4">4thly. That you look well to the quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications of thoſe men that you put into of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, as you deſire a reformation to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in the colony; that they be men ſober, ſolid, excelling in government, firmneſs of judgment and reſolution. Indeed the rule requires them to be fearers of God. 2 Sam. 2.3.3. The God of Iſrael ſaid, the rock of Iſrael ſpake to me. He that ruleth over men, muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly. Since the Moſt High has inveſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you with the power of putting in civil officers, to put into execution the good &amp; wholſome laws of this colony; then I ſhould think it remains with you carefully to inſpect all ſuch, and ſee that they faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully attend to their work. I am much miſtaken if there is not a great want here. Juſtices of the peace, and grand jurors, with other officers, are ſadly wanting in the faithful diſcharge of their office, of being
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:010621_0212_0F81B9D79B40F978"/>
a terror to evil doers. I am very ſlow to believe, that profane ſwearing, drunkenneſs, uncleanneſs, revelings &amp; card playing, and ſo much bad company in taverns, lightneſs and vanity upon the ſabbath, would ſo prevail in our land, if officers ſtood where they are called of the moſt high to be; for the Lord is uniform in his working, &amp; would graciouſly grant them that aid and divine ſolemnity and power, as would ſtrike the wicked with dread and fear of juſt pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment; ſo that our officers would ſoon become a terror to evil doers, and a praiſe and encouragement to thoſe that do well, of any denomination. For my part I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair of theſe evils being removed till there is a reformation in thoſe officers, (and heads of families reform) or others that will be faithful put in their places , unleſs the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Lord Jeſus pour out his ſpirit marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly upon the land, and that will effect the work to purpoſe. Nevertheleſs, (if God withhold) duty belongs to every one faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to diſcharge in their relation and place, leaving the ſucceſs with him that righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enjoins duty &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="6">6thly. And with all humility I would offer a word of caution and warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to ſuch rulers as are in an unconverted ſtate; doubtleſs there is ſome of our rulers that are not converted, made holy in heart—

Chriſt ſaith, that by their fruits ye ſhall know them. Matt. 7.16. It is evident that ſome of them bring forth fruits that ſhew they are not holy ſanctified men, yet they may under God, by improving their authority by common grace, be a bleſſing to mankind in the execution of civil juſtice, and protecting the church and people of God, (not lording it over God's heritage.) Cyrus altho' ignorant of God, was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful inſtrument for good to the church of God; and Jehu did well in executing that which was right in God's ſight, for which God ſee fit to honour him with placing his children upon the throne, to the fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; but all the while not holy at heart. 2 Kings 10. But alas! I fear many of you come greatly ſhort of Jehu, and do the work of the Lord negligently, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of having the temporal bleſſings of heaven, procure to yourſelves and family, the curſe and frowns of heaven. Jer. 48.10. It is juſtly expected that civil rulers ſince they are God's miniſters, and are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to act for a holy God of inflexible juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; that above all men among us, (ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting miniſters of the goſpel) ought to ſet the beſt example in all things in their lives and converſations. But it is, and ſhould be for a lamentation, that ſo many of them are light and carnal men that live in the

ſpirit of the world, which is enmity to God, Rom. 8.7. alſo are mockers, and ſcoffers at the work, ſpirit and power of God, that ſcorn and hate the ſubjects of God's free grace; will ſuch be intreated &amp; prayed in Chriſt's name, ſeriouſly to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how far you act out of your character, as acting for God; 1 Cor. 10.32. ſetting the caſe that your neighbours are deluded. Ought you not to have bowels of pity for them, and uſe ſcripture and reaſon as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per means to convince them of their errors? for it is a ſhocking conſideration to think of perſons periſhing in their deluſions, and to make a mock at ſuch, muſt be moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable and ſinful. But if it ſhould ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that theſe perſons mocked, ſhould be the true fearers of God, the favourites of heaven; How unreaſonable is it then, to treat them in ſuch an irreligious manner? all ſuch would do well to conſider how they ſhall be able to meet that omnipotent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that will e'er long, avenge all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries done to his redeemed ones. Pray read for your conviction, Pſalm 105, 14.15. Zec. 2, 8. Iſa. 26 chap. and chap. 28, 14 to 22. and chap. 51, 21.22.23. Mal. 4, 1.

May the good Lord in his abundant mercy, prevent, and make you partakers of his rich and free pardoning grace. But by this time ſome of my readers may object and ſay, that I am a poor deluded creature not worth regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Anſwer. However that be, it is (as I truſt and believe) the truth of God that I hold forth, and that cannot be deluded; and if I am not worth any regard, the truth that I have held forth is worth all mens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding. Further you may ſay, that I am in a harſh party cenſorious ſpirit: if that ſhould be ſo, ſure I am, the truth is meek and free from party; yea far from cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and never wants charity; and I humbly believe, however I may be wanting of a right temper and frame of mind, it is the truth that I have held forth in the main, and that will never be found wanting; therefore I beg liberty to be out of the queſtion, and let truth and conſcience ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle things right; then my deſires will be anſwered.</p>
            <p n="7">7thly. A word of counſel and caution, to ſuch rulers as are ſerious and godly. As I find myſelf concerned for your honour and true happineſs, I would hope it may apoligize for me in addreſſing of you in the following manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="219" facs="unknown:010621_0216_0F81B9DCEF163AD0"/>Firſt. Pray be intreated (by one that is unequal and moſt unworthy) to conſider the great advantage you are put into, to do much for the advancement of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's kingdom, your advancement to high honour and ſeats of dignity, ſhould lay you ſenſibly under the moſt ſtrong bonds and obligations poſſible, to improve all your knowledge, gifts and grace, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Chriſt's deſpiſed cauſe. I think it well becomes you to get a right underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſacred rights and privileges of the church and people of God. Alſo that natural right of thinking and chuſing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious matters, which all mankind are born into the world with. You well know that when the free ſpirit of God takes the government of your hearts, and you are brought near to your great Lord and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in ſenſible union and communion, and your thoughts turn upon the deplorable ſtate of your chriſtleſs friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, your bowels yearn with compaſſion for their precious immortal ſouls; when it is thus with you, then you want to uſe no weapons for their help, but the ſword of the ſpirit which is the word of God; ſcripture and reaſon with your ſtrong cries to God for mercy for them, is the utmoſt that you are diſpoſed to uſe for their help. Altho' you are inveſted with the civil ſword
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:010621_0217_0F81B9DD9394F468"/>
you well know that the civil power cannot convince the underſtanding, nor change the heart, is entirely uſeleſs in religious matters. Surely then it will be for your higheſt honor, to exerciſe all your abilities, and improve all your influence and power to exalt Jeſus Chriſt, lord of conſcience, the alone king and head of his church and people. Jeſus Chriſt is infinitely worthy of your utmoſt attention and care, to hold up his royal and ſpotleſs robes, which if I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take not, this generation is trampling under foot—deſpiſing the gracious influence of his holy ſpirit, ſcorning the ſpotleſs righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Son of God, which only can make the ſoul comely, beautiful &amp; happy. Alſo that you exerciſe yourſelves to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in all ſcriptural meaſures, to ſet the royal majeſtic crown upon Chriſt's dignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exalted head; which if I miſtake not, the religious conſtitution of this colony has (as much as in it lieth) taken off; or in other words, baniſhed him from his rightful ſeat of government in Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut. Therefore you ought to ſee to it, you that are godly rulers (and in a miſtical ſenſe, near akin to your ſpiritual David) that you are not the laſt to invite and bring the king back to his houſe, and rightful ſeat of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in his church, &amp;c. 2 Sam. 19, 11, 12. Furthermore, I would humbly and earneſtly requeſt of your honors, that you
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:010621_0218_0F81B9DE503F06F0"/>
uſe your utmoſt endeavours to caſt up the free goſpel high-way, thro' this colony, that the ranſomed of the Lord may return to Zion with ſongs of praiſe; and that every let and hinderance may be removed out of the way of your exalted Lord or Savior; ſo that he may march thro' the length and breadth of this colony, without interrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from men's inventions or traditions, and gather churches when and where he ſees fit in his wiſdom, and organize the ſame, with ſuch officers as he has deſcribed in his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word, fitted and qualified therefor. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to acquaint you from certain ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural knowledge, that Jeſus Chriſt has a dear ſpouſe, that he hath betrothed to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in righteouſneſs, bought with his own precious blood, here in this colony, that is under perſecution and oppreſſion, which this book has ſufficiently ſhewn. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is your buſineſs as God's miniſters in the civil kingdom, to appear for her relief; yet it ill becomes you to uſe the civil ſword in the affairs of Chriſt's kingdom, which is ſpiritual; but it well becomes you to uſe it for to break the arms of the oppreſſors, and let the oppreſſed go free. Jer. 21, 12. Pſal. 72.4. This your righteous Lord &amp; Maſter, will require at your hands; theſe churches have improved the beſt of their wiſdom, (placing Jeſus Chriſt the only Lord
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:010621_0219_0F81B9DF18121C00"/>
and head of his church) to get relief, and all without ſucceſs. Wherefore I think it is high time that you ſhew yourſelves in your practice, miniſters of God ſo. Zion's good; and if you rightly apply yourſelves to your work, the ſtrong, fervent, and conſtant prayers of the Godly of every profeſſion, will much more than countervail the mocks and ſcoffs of the proud and haught, which you muſt expect to meet with, if you are faithful in the great and important truſt committed to you. Pray mind your Lord's caution, Mark 8, 34, to the end. And let none of theſe things move you from mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward, for a glorious reformation in church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Be perſuaded to wake up to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, from a due concern to glorify and ſerve the Lord in your day and generation; and ſtand in the civil kingdom where the God of Juſtice has aſſigned you your lot, and labour to get much acquaintance with God in his exalted greatneſs, majeſty, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and purity, which is ſuited to fortify your minds with ſuitable courage and holy bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in your work, forthwith draw out the ſword of civil juſtice out of the ſheath, and let it be furbiſhed and made bright for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; hold it daily in your hands, and as occaſion ſerves, thruſt it into the bowels of growing vice, ſin and immorality; and I
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:010621_0220_0F81B9DFCD847AD0"/>
firmly believe there would ſoon be an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in our towns for the better, and may the Moſt high God, grant a united agreement in all civil officers of every rank and order, to move forward in his holy fear and divine wiſdom, for a reformation throughout our colony and land; the praiſe ſhall be given to God alone, and the peace and comfort of it be enjoyed by the people, and you that are the happy inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of it through free grace, be rewarded with the bleſſings of time and eternity.</p>
            <p n="8">8thly. That I may be quit of the blood of all men, I muſt warn unconverted mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of every profeſſion, to wake up, before the avenger of blood overtake you. What men upon the earth have more to anſwer for than unconverted miniſters? ſome of whom have the blood of hundreds cleaving to them—miſerable, preſumptious wretches, who have forced themſelves into the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, for a maintenance, and a purſe of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or ſome other ſelfiſh motive! Perfect wiſdom has drawn your character all over the ſcriptures; read it in the old teſtament and new. Iſa. 46.10.11.12. Jer. 23. chap. Ezek. 13 chap. &amp; 34. Micah 3 chap. Mat. 7.15 to 23. chap. 15.13, 14. John 10, 1 to 14. Rev. 2.2. You are called foxes, dumb dogs, thieves, robbers, wolves, liars which come to ſteal and kill.—You plead
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:010621_0221_0F81B9E11EA16A58"/>
much for a line of ſucceſſion, down from the apoſtles: but your idea and applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is corrupt; yet your proper line is eaſily traced in the word of God and church hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, down to Chriſt's day, an uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed line. Therefore read your character, in the characters of your predeceſſors, in which you may ſee your own faces, Mat. 23. here is your picture drawn, not by a poor ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate (who you diſdain in your hearts, as Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah of Gath, did David) but by the Son of God, whoſe flaming jealous eye looks thro' and thro' all your ſophiſtry &amp; falſe gloſſes, that you uſe to deceive the people. Chriſt has given you your proper name, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned you your juſt doom, in the 33 ver. Ye ſerpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye eſcape the damnation of hell? You are called ſerpents, becauſe of the craft, guile and deceit you uſe to delude the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your care; uſing all the art and craft that you are maſters of, to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the work of God, is the work of the devil; or if you cannot get along with ſo rank a hold, you will give ſome faint, hypocritical acknowledgement of it; but the inſtruments improved in it are diſorderly, &amp;c. A viper, becauſe if the moſt high God ſends his Holy Spirit to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince and convert ſinners, and call them out from your dead, dull, blind miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:010621_0222_0F81B9E18BB1FCF0"/>
or life-leſs reading, inſtead of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then you will vent out your venom, ſpite and malice againſt the ſpirit, work, &amp; peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, and weary out your ſober ſort of hearers, with reading about deluſions, &amp; falſe ſeducing teachers, claming againſt the ſpirit and power of religion. Poor blind guides! that from your firſt entering your grammar, to your becoming lords o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſocieties, and maſters of large fleeces, every degree of advancement is ſuited in the policy of ſatan, to call forth every ſpark of pride, that is in you by nature, that by the time you have been ſettled a few years, you bear a nearer reſemblance to lucifer, than you do the humble miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt; and unleſs you repent a repentance unto life, you muſt have the moſt aggravated dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of any men living. May the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and almighty God, that met a mad, perſecuting Saul, meet you in his great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and put forth his conquering power, and bring down the pride of your hearts, and ſave your ſouls from the dreadful hell that now awaits you, whilſt in your ſins.</p>
            <p n="9">9thly. I beg liberty to uſe freedom and unboſom my pained heart, to ſuch as are converted miniſters, in the conſociated churches. Your Lord, and my divine Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, allows me to addreſs you by way of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating you, ſince you are elders; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:010621_0223_0F81B9E22CE93910"/>
pray take into cloſe conſideration, how it was with you in years paſt, when the Spirit of Chriſt dwelt and governed daily in you; what divine peace you had with God, and the dear ſaints! what a ſpirit of prayer and divine etraction, and out-goings of ſoul to God! Indulged by heaven at times, to get very near, ſenſibly near to God in prayer, to aſk, as it were, what you would, &amp; thro' free grace it was done for you. What ſenſible views of future &amp; eternal things! How ſweet and ſenſible was the love of Chriſt upon your hearts at times, and preſent and real was the terrors of God's law! Both which animated your ſouls in the great and important work, that you was entirely engaged in. How did the cries and intreaties of the ſtarved ſaints and earneſt invitations of awakened ſinners, take faſt hold of your minds, and ſuitably effect your hearts; when upon their urgent invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, you could once in a while leave your few ſheep, with the keeper of Iſrael, and out into the field of the goſpel, to feed Chriſt's ſheep and lambs, and to fiſh for ſouls; not with a bundle of dry ſermons, wrote out every ſentence and word, that your own wiſdom and gifts had formed; no, whatever you might have wrote at times, you had the Spirit's help lead and aid in the inditing, and when you improved, your
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:010621_0224_0F81B9E2DA1E0130"/>
mind lay open to the holy Spirit's further aid, its quickening and leading influences, that when new matter preſented to your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding which you had neither penned down, nor premeditated; you freely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered your powers to the Spirit's light, lead and power. Rom. 6.16. ch. 10.15. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermore you never regarded ſociety lines, nor miniſters, as a foundation of action. If when you was invited to preach, in this or that ſociety, the miniſter conſented, &amp; the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe open, you rejoiced therein; but if not, it hindred not, for ſome private houſe was prepared, or barn, or horſe-block, or the ſhade of ſome tree, and the goſpel which Chriſt gave you, was as ſweet and precious to you and the hearers, as in a meeting-houſe; whilſt you was ſubjected to Chriſt, in the teaching, leading, ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influences of his ſpirit. You regarded not the religious conſtitution of this colony in your daily practice. And ſome of you in my hearing ſaid, civil rulers had nothing to do to make laws about religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for a ſhort time you went on in a ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural line of duty, doing the work of the day, in the day, preaching ſometimes day and night, and every day in the week, in ſome ſpecial ſeaſons of the out-pourings of God's Spirit; and when you came <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

nor write, you neither pick'd up an old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, nor went to change with another mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter: But your prayer, ſtrong and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant cry, was to God, that he who called you into the work, would graciouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to furniſh you with ſuitable mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for your great work. You improving the little time you had, in a way of duty; ſearching the ſcriptures, meditation &amp; pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the kind Lord has led your minds to ſome ſuitable portion of God's word; you following the light and lead of the Holy Spirit. Truth hath opened to your underſtanding, ſufficient, with your truſt in God for a ſolid foundation of action, for you ſee doubtleſs, that preaching is the gift of God; the Lord works in and by your rational powers and faculties, by the power of his ſpirit. Sometimes it pleaſed the Lord to give you an heart effecting ſight of his dread majeſty, and lay death and hell as it were naked in your ſight; at other times to diſcover his high, deep and boundleſs mercy, and raviſh your ſouls with a view of his divine glory, &amp;c. Thus in ſhort, I am ready to think, your former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, witneſſes to the ſubſtance of this obſervation, in which time, you and your unconverted brethren in the miniſtry, was at odds, and meet in two companies, as much as we and they are two; you had no
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:010621_0226_0F81B9E641CE76A0"/>
ſhare in their effections or pulpits; then we poor laymen. You could eſcape the laſh of their ſcoffs and mocks, no more than we now do; and they remain the ſame men (moſt of them) give no ſcriptural evidence of being converted, and made holy in heart; but remain ſtill haters of the holy Spirit's work and operation; and you and they have got together again, (to appearance) eaſy and quiet in one ſcheme and practice. And this, this dear ſirs, is a great ſtumbling block to thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and is too high for me to account for. If you are now workers together with the Lord; pray call to mind theſe paſſages of ſcripture, which doubtleſs you took ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial notice of in the day when your names was caſt out as evil. See Mat. 10 ch. John 15.16, to the end. ch. 16, &amp; 17. 1 Cor. 2. ch. 2 Cor. 6.14, to the end. 1 John 4, 4, 5, 6. ch, 5.19.20, Gal. 4.29. 2 Tim. 3. 12. Theſe ſcriptures in a very ſtriking man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner divides between Chriſt's followers and and the world's followers, or between them that live in the rule of God's word, &amp; them that do not, plainly ſhewing, that their is no agreement or fellowſhip between them. I think you ought to take it into cloſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, how or whence it is, that you and they are in ſuch fellowſhip together; whilſt they remain enemies to Chriſt &amp; his cauſe; this ought not to paſs without a

right ſettlement. I am obliged to think, that you have let down your watch, and have ſaid a confederacy, where your worthy Lord and Maſter ſaith there ſhould be none. Iſa. 8.12. Alſo I think you diſregard your Lord's direction, Jer. 15, 19, 20. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus ſaith the Lord—and if thou take forth the precious from the vile, thou ſhalt be as my mouth: let them return unto thee, but return not thou unto them. Pray ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, you have not taken the precious from the vile. You admit into church fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, unqualified perſons, and ſo have forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us out from among you, for you have little or no goſpel diſcipline among you, &amp; the gifts and graces of God's Spirit. Rom. 12.6, 7, 8. 1 Pet. 4.10, 11. Your church members deſpiſe and reject; alſo you have refuſed to divide between wicked rulers and ſuch as are godly, and have kept back, and not declared the whole truth, to let the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers know where they have gone out of their work, as God's miniſters for our good; and enacted laws, which (doubtleſs) you know are repugnant to the word of God.

Jer. 23.22. Alſo your practice in taking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the miniſtry, unconverted men, or at leaſt them that you knew to your ſatisfaction give no ſcriptural evidence of that work of God's Spirit upon their hearts, which you know all men muſt have that are made holy in heart. And from the acquaintance that you have had with ſome of your brethren in the miniſtry, for years in converſation &amp; hearing them perform their ſervice; I doubt not but you think in the uprightneſs of your hearts, that they are yet unconverted. And if ſo, what a ſad, ſad caſe is this, when the poor creatures are leading their flocks down to hell! for ſo Chriſt ſettles the point. Mat. 15.14. You holding your peace in ſuch a diſtreſſing and dangerous caſe, is what has filled my heart with pain for you: and how you can be quit from blood guiltineſs, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond me to ſay. Yet it is eaſy to ſay by your practice of uniting all together, the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and the wicked. you forfeit your right to God's gracious preſence, in your work. Mat. 28.20. Jer. 15, 19; or of being ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored of God, to be his mouth to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Again, with all humility, ſuffer me once more to intreat you to conſider, how will you be able to anſwer for your practice to your Lord, when he ſaith, but return not thou unto them: and you right in the face of this prohibition, have joined with

the dark, blind, formal profeſſors, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted miniſters, who are heart enemies to our dear Lord and maſter, who hate Chriſt and the manner of his working. It appears to me, if you ſee your own practice in ſcripture light, your mouths would be forever ſtopped, from faulting us that have conſcientiouſly diſcented from you; not from any diſlike to your perſons; but from your unſcriptural practice, that we might keep a chaſte conſcience to our only Lord and Redeemer. Wherefore pray be perſuaded to look carefully into theſe things, that you may ſee what is amiſs, and repent, and turn to God, and the rule of his word; and move forward in holy boldneſs for a refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; get where your works will not be burnt up, (1 Cor. 3.13, 14, 15.) and you able to ſtand thro' free grace, where you can bid your coming Lord, welcome to do his whole will to this generation.</p>

How you put up with your miniſters conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you, is beyond me to ſay; for ſome of them flattered you, that they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregationaliſts, and held with you in prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, till they got ſettled, and got you faſt bound in their iron fetters, and made you ſlaves, then they practice in the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and you brethren have got ſo ſtuned and infeabled by their craft, that you neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect your great duty of bringing your mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters up to the rule of God's word, which would ſoon diſcover their deceit. If you begin a labour with them, you being ſo entangled with them, ten to one, if they do not circumvent you in your deſign, and prevent you getting a church meeting, to conſider things in the rule; or if you preſs things ſo hard, as to get a church meeting, the miniſter likely will work his ſcheme ſo as nothing can be done in the church (where all matters ſhould be ſettled) but carry the caſe to the conſociation, and then

brethren you may depend upon it, your miniſter will go off with flying colours, &amp; you muſt fall in the rear. For if he has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered hereſy, in the pulpit, the council will likely work it ſo, as to make it palata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the body of the ſociety; or if their be immoral practice found with the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, the venerable council can put forth their compulſive power, and draw up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion for the miniſter, and force him to own it, and the church to accept it, and ſo think they have done pretty well—and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing done in the mind of God: Yet they have gained their deſigned end; for after the matter has reſted, ſo as the miniſter has got a little credit, they will diſmiſs him, and off he goes to deceive another people, &amp;c. <note n="‖" place="bottom">If my reader is diſſatisfied with this obſervation; inquire for things of this nature at Middletown, Middle-field, Marlborough, Turkey Hills and Sharon.</note> To return.

            <p n="12">12thy. A word to my brethren in this reformation, that have refuſed to pay rates to ſociety miniſters, and now pay them. Dear brethren, remember what David ſaid, Pſal. 141, 5. Let the righteous ſmite me, it ſhall be a kindneſs &amp;c. And now ſuffer me in love to uſe freedom with you, for your paying is grievous to me, and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to your neighbours; wounding to the
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:010621_0233_0F81B9EDA926CA40"/>
cauſe of Chriſt, tending to harden poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners in their ſins; ſeriouſly conſider! Ought you not to be conſiſtent with yourſelves in your chriſtian practice? and ſo tell your neighbours, that when you refuſed to pay your rates, that you was deluded, and got wilful, and acted in a party againſt the good rule of ſupporting the miniſters by rates, that you are heartily ſorry for your paſt conduct, and now promiſe to be obedient to the good conſtitution. Or if you acted in the fear of the Lord when you refuſed to pay and went to priſon, ſome of you to keep a chaſte conſcience rather than to pay, being inſtructed from the word of God, that the goſpel ought to be ſupported by freely contributing for that end, without civil, powers forcing away mens eſtates, or impriſoning their bodies; you having ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berly diſſented from the conſtitution and worſhipped God elſe where, as you thought agreeable to his word, and choſe to be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſubmitting your bodies and eſtates to the diſpoſal of providence. Had peace in your conſcience and the divine preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, took joyfully the ſpoiling of your goods, knowing in yourſelves that ye have in heaven a better and an enduring ſubſtance; Heb. 10, 34. in which time you loved Chriſt's cauſe better than your word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſt. Obſerve brethren if this was
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:010621_0234_0F81B9EE57322410"/>
your caſe! (as I ſuppoſe it was) then I think for you to be honeſt men conſiſtent with yourſelves, you ought to tell your brethren and neighbours, (that your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary practice has ſtumbled) that you have ſhamefully declined in religion, and loſt a ſenſe of the worth of precious never dying ſouls, and the ſweet preſence of Chriſt, that filled your hearts with holy fear of ſinning againſt God, when you refuſed to pay &amp;c. But now you have got wordly, careleſs &amp; covetous, and do not love to have your goods ſpoil'd, and pay what they unjuſtly demand to prevent it; but you are obliged to pay it grudgingly with a coveting mind, far, very far from any true joy in the whole affair; your practice in paying your rates will not admit of any joy in God, which if duly conſidered, is ſuited to convict you that your paying is wrong, if you would not ſhut your eyes againſt the light, for you ſhould know all that God requires may be done with delight in God, and peace of conſcience and good will to men; therefore I think that you ought to let your poor neighbours know, that you pay your rates thro' coveteouſneſs, that you love your eſtates better than their ſouls, or the cauſe of Chriſt, refuſing to bear Chriſt's ſweet croſs. If you would be thus honeſt, poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly you might offer ſome conviction to
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:010621_0235_0F81B9EF26133CF8"/>
your neighbours for their good, for they would know where you be. But your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to pay ſome years back, and ſaying you acted duty or was called of God ſo to do, and now tamely ſubmit and pay &amp;c. I think is a flat contradiction in your prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, which lieth with you to reconcile. But you are excuſing yourſelves, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not a cenſurable evil to pay, there is no warrant to deal with a church member &amp;c. Pray brethren ſeriouſly conſider what is in your words and practice! you grant it to be an evil, but not a cenſurable evil to pay; ſo that if your credit is not hurt, nor you brought under diſcipline, you may do what evil you pleaſe, (almoſt) to ſave your idols and temporal intereſt. But dearly belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eds, is this a mark of a child of God, or fruits that the godly bring forth? no ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, very far from it, what a holy and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous God hates; ſuffer me my brethren to uſe freedom with you, and to be in my gift and not in Zion, (which is to be cloſe and plain) therefore I teſtify if you live in the known indulgence of any evil in your hearts, which no mortal eye may ſee, you are not fit to be a member of the church millitant, and much leſs fit for the church triumphant. But what do you mean brethren, by ſaying a cenſurable evil? is there any ſin or evil that is known to be
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:010621_0236_0F81B9EF8E6C1F98"/>
ſo, &amp; indulged &amp; lived in, that is not cenſura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? if ſo, be ſo kind as to let me know what that ſin is, &amp; where Chriſt has given the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence; for I freely confeſs, I never learned Chriſt, nor his religion ſo. I freely own, that we are very imperfect, whilſt in this life, &amp; come ſhort daily and hourly; and ſin has too much influence in us. But then the godly are far from indulging any ſin, in heart or practice—are conſtantly at war, more or leſs againſt all ſin &amp; evil, in heart, lip or life, all their days are in the field of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, waring againſt all ſin. Read theſe ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Rom. 7.24. 1 Cor. 5.6.7.8. Mat. 7.20 to 27. Lu. 9.57, to the end. Mat. 10.37.38.39. 1 Joh. 3.17, to 21. ch. 5.17.18. La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour brethren to get a true or right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of what theſe ſcriptures contain, &amp; what it is to be truly godly; for I am jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that there is too many that are exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally in this reformation, that bear the name of ſeperates, and church members, that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was ſeparated from an immoderate love to the world, or their heart idols; never made holy in heart, and when weighed in the ballance, will be found wanting. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, I am not without fears, that the devil is laying a plot, to blow up theſe reforming churches, in the land, even upon this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and practice, viz. that there are ſome ſins and evils which may be indulged in churches. I readily grant that there is a
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:010621_0237_0F81B9F04CFC3BE8"/>
great deal of labour, patience and forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to be uſed, with perſons ignorant, that their practice is evil, when in fact it is. But when a perſon knows that either his words or actions is evil, contrary to the ſcriptures, and the perſon be indulged in his evil, or wrong way, becauſe his ſin is ſmall, this is beyond me, and I believe beyond the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures too, for they require us to be holy in all manner of converſation. 1 Pet. Alſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God. 1 Cor. 10, 31. That you may know how ſtrict I underſtand the laws of Chriſt's houſe to be, take my mind in the following ſuppoſition, (as thus) ſuppoſing a church member is apt to jeſt or joke in the ſpirit of the world, (which the world calls civil) and he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved therefor, and retract it and own it wrong; if he ſhould fall ſeven times in a day, and return again, &amp; ſhew repentance, (Luke 17, 4.) we are bound to forgive him; but if he ſhould jeſt but once, and juſtify himſelf in it, as being but a common infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or ſmall evil, that ought to be indulged in this imperfect ſtate; this I teſtify lays foundation for that labour, that ſhould not end, till the perſon is bro't to repentance, or excluded the holy fellowſhip of the church. This my principle may be too ſtrict for ſome of my readers; but likely
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:010621_0238_0F81B9F113A8DA28"/>
you will all grant in this ſtriking light, that where a perſon commits facts that ſhew enmity to God, and ſtands to juſtify himſelf therein; that in ſuch a caſe, after due labour, he ought to be excluded from the church. Therefore, read for your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, Rom. 8.7. Becauſe the carnal mind is enmity againſt God, for it is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. James 4.4. The friendſhip of the world, is enmity with God. Here it is plain, that the ſpirit that leads a man to jeſt with the carnal world, ſtrikes at the whole government of Chriſt's houſe, cannot be ſubject to Chriſt's laws; but muſt be caſt out, &amp;c. Again. It is generally allowed, that he that practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces contrary to the word of God, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows himſelf ſo to do, is cenſurable. This I think is the caſe of every man, that has ſeen the ſcripture method of ſupporting the goſpel by freely contributing therefor, ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to pay the ſociety miniſter's rate, and now pay it; ſuch a perſon's practice is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the following ſcriptures. Iſa. 8.11. 12. Here the Lord ſaith, walk not in the way of this people, ſaying, ſay ye not, a confederacy, to all them to whom this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall ſay a confederacy; but you that pay, ſay (at leaſt in your practice) no, Lord, it will not do now to follow your directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if I do, they will waſte my eſtate; I
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:010621_0239_0F81B9F206BAC358"/>
muſt walk in their way for the preſent, &amp; confederate with them, in paying the rate, they demand, till I am ſet off by them. Ver. 20. To the law and to the teſtimony,— the Moſt High requires us all to walk; but your practice ſaith not ſo Lord, I muſt comply with men's inventions, and traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſave my ſubſtance, &amp;c. But I ſhould note here, that there is no muſt in the caſe, only what comes from a diſtruſt of God, and a covetous heart. You ſay, if you do not pay, they will waſte your eſtates; you ſpeak preſumtuouſly, what you do not know, for it has often happened to them, that endeavour to walk uprightly with God in this caſe, and practice their principles, that the collector has been reſtrained from taking any thing; alſo when they have been ſuffered to go forward, hardened in their ſinful practice, &amp; ſtrained their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours goods, or impriſoned their bodies, ſome tender conſciences have been waked up to ſee the injuſtice and oppreſſion done to their neighbours, that they have paid their rates for them, ſo none of their goods have been waſted; or it may be poſſible, if not the caſe, that the Devil out of policy, when he ſees his kingdom ſhaking, may influence his inſtruments to club together and pay the ſeperates rates, in order to ſave his ſcheme and kingdom, from ſhaking to pieces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="unknown:010621_0240_0F81B9F2C4ABB590"/>My goods have been ſtrained away, and carried off, and kept awhile, and returned again, without any concern or care of mine, one way or other. Through which means (I ſuppoſe) my ſubſtance and all the flocks in the ſociety reſted quiet for years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But had I been ſo fooliſh, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with myſelf, and the word of God, as to have paid the collector's demands; I ſhould doubtleſs have opened the door for the oppreſſor to have waſted the ſubſtance of the flock. Again, ſee Phil. 3.16. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs whereunto we have already attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, let us walk by the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame things. You brethren that refuſed to pay from the knowledge of the ſcripture rule of ſupporting the goſpel and now pay, you go againſt this precept, and in your practice, neither walk by the ſame rule, nor mind the ſame things, and for no other reaſon only to ſave your eſtates, or unrighteous mammon. That in your own imagination, the ſcriptures are not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded in this caſe, for your wiſdom has found out a better way, much more pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſaving, to preſerve your ſubſtance &amp;c. But know brethren of a certainty, that the ſcriptures ſhall not fall to the ground unfulfilled, Luke 17.33. Again ſee Gal. 2.18. For if I build again the
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:010621_0241_0F81B9F69790B700"/>
things which I deſtroyed, I make myſelf a tranſgreſſor. It appears to me brethren, that Paul was more honeſt and upright than you be; he reaſons juſtly according to the true nature of things; but you have got wiſer (in your imagination) than the inſpired Apoſtle, and have found out a way to build again the things that you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, in word, principle and practice; and hold yourſelves innocent. You ought to remember how you have acted in years paſt, when ſome of you ſenſibly loved the Lord, his cauſe, and the ſalvation of ſouls, above all things created. What prayers you put up to God, that this wicked oppreſſive ſcheme of ſupporting a pretended goſpel by force, (waſting mens eſtates, &amp; impriſoning their bodies for that end) might be detected and brought down, when your hearts was in ſome meaſure right with God, and your practice agreable thereto; then you gave this oppreſſive ſcheme a bleſſed ſhock, and If you had kept in love with Chriſt's ſweet &amp; worthy croſs, and practiced ſteadfaſt in your principles; it is likely to me that kind providence would find out ſome way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief by this time. But now by your pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, you ſink and deny your former teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, harden your poor neighbours, that begin to wake up, and their conſciences to
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:010621_0242_0F81B9F744B59100"/>
ſcorch them for their cruel oppreſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards you; they improve your paying to heal their chaffed conſciences, for now there is no goods waſted, nor violence uſed, for you pay their demands yourſelves, and it is got to be brave times in ſuch ſocieties, where there is no public witneſs held up, that the goſpel ſhould not be made merchandize of. But pray brethren think, think of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequence of your practice. You take your ſubſtance which Chriſt has pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed with his precious blood, and put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your ſtewardſhip, and charged you to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the ſame to his glory, and give the ſame to ſupport unconverted miniſters, (which doubtleſs is moſtly the caſe) whom the ſcripture calls wolves, dogs, thieves, robbers, which ſteal, kill and deſtroy. Joh. 10.1.10. Mat. 7.15. Yea, properly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch are ſoul murderers, leading their flocks down to hell. Mat. 15.14. Now you take your ſubſtance, which the Lord challenges as his, to be otherwiſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved to his glory, and pay with your own hand, or under diſguiſe, let your wives or children pay to ſupport all this dreadful, ſoul-ruining practice. Dear brethren, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour above all things to get near to God, &amp; take a view of your conduct in ſcripture light, perhaps hell is peopled through your
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:010621_0243_0F81B9F86DB314D8"/>
means of paying to ſupport blind guides, for ſuch miſerable miniſters, if they get the money, care not who goes to hell, or what becomes of ſouls, when their ſelfiſh, covetous ends are anſwered.</p>
            <p>Again. You are told, to be careful for nothing, but in every thing by prayer and ſupplication, with thankſgiving, let your requeſt be made known unto God. Phil. 4.6. But when you pay, you go abreaſt to this bleſſed direction, for it is anxious care, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fear of loſing your ſubſtance, makes you pay. You are much without a ſpirit of prayer, and cannot bleſs God for your paying, becauſe you pay grudgingly and cannot pay otherwiſe. Mat. 7.18. There is no thankſgiving concerned in the whole af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair. But if you ſtand ſteadfaſt in the truth, and refuſe to pay, or have any concern with the collector, more or leſs, only to hold up truth to him, in meekneſs and love; then through free grace you can cheerfully and ſweetly comply with every part of this bleſſed direction, which is worth mountains of gold and ſilver, and ought to be retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every heart as a moſt valuable, rich treaſure, ſo as to practice the ſame, as in Pſal. 119.11. Thy word have I hid in my heart, that I might not ſin againſt thee. Did you ſubmit to the direction here given,
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:010621_0244_0F81B9F89450AB18"/>
you would never pay another rate; and if all the brethren thro' the colony, that has come into this reformation, would from love to God, and the rule the ſcripture gives to ſupport the goſpel, refuſe to pay another rate, I much believe you would in a few years ſee ſome way found out in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for your relief. Light in this affair is got ſo far into the underſtanding of this generation, that ſuch oppreſſion followed, would ſoon ſhake many a church or ſociety into pieces, that would preſume to practice in it, to drain away the ſubſtance of their neighbours, who ſtand in no relation with them in religious matters, who differ from them in many things in principle &amp; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, it is againſt the light of nature, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and ſcripture. My daily prayer is, that a juſt and merciful God would haſten the final overthrow of this oppreſſive prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſupporting religious worſhip, by rates, force, waſting of goods and priſons. But you that pay are inſtruments of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back the work of God in this affair, and prop up that which the Lord would have flung down. Wherefore be intreated to conſider your character, and hear the voice of the Lord to you. Rev. 2.4.5.</p>
            <p n="13">13thly. A word to my brethren in the miniſtry, who are gifted, anointed, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:010621_0245_0F81B9F959B321D0"/>
to the work by Jeſus Chriſt. Suffer me to addreſs you in the words of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, Acts 20, 28. Take heed therefore unto yourſelves, and to all the flock, over the which the holy Ghoſt hath made you over-ſeers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchaſed with his own blood. You do well beloveds, always to keep in mind your great and abſolute need of Chriſt's help, &amp; that your ſtanding is by faith and fruitful obedience to the whole of Chriſt's will, Rom. 11, 20. Matt. 28, 20. If you have counted the coſt aright in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into the miniſtry, you have counted it as Paul did, ſee Phili. 3, 7 to 7. ch. 4, 11.12.13. 2 Cor. 6, 3 to 11. Here brethren is your pattern next to Jeſus Chriſt; and if you copy after this brave hero, who went on undaunted in his work, and fought the good fight, and kept the ſaith, you will doubtleſs find a crown of righteouſneſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for you at the end or your faithful race, as well as for Paul. 2 Tim. 4, 7.8. Whilſt we are in the church militant, we ought always to keep in mind, that the grand adverſary of ſouls is laying ſnares for our feet, behind and before; therefore I look upon it quite neceſſary for a miniſter of Chriſt, to be well acquainted with Satan's devices, underſtanding the manner of his working in the falſe operations that attend
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:010621_0246_0F81B9FA0C945640"/>
a perſon void of humility and divine love. The perſon deluded, layeth great ſtreſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his feelings, and the impreſſions upon his mind, neglecting a due examination from what ſpirit they come; he can neglect duty here and there, and commit this fault, and that as ſuits his mind, and cry grace, free grace; and in his vain imagination, leave Chriſt to make up for his miſconduct, when the truth is, the perſon that hath the true operations of the holy ſpirit, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains pardoning mercy from Jeſus Chriſt, is led to take up his croſs and live a life of ſelf denial, and thro' Chriſt's free ſpirit, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages in all ſelf mortifying duties required from love to Chriſt, ſatisfied in his will, ſenſible of his own weakneſs and inability thereto, ever looking out of himſelf for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed ſtrength from Chriſt, to perform all the duties required to the glory and honour of Chriſt. Again when a perſon has been ſnared with Satan's angelick light, a falſe ſpirit and comes to ſee it, the devil ſtands ready to catch the mind with a legal ſpirit, and fix it down to the letter, and get the perſon to be very regular, and as he thinks uſe a great deal of chriſtian prudence, (when it is wordly wiſdom) which drops a man ſhort of living a life of faith on the Son of God, daily and hourly looking to the Lord for wiſdom, righteouſneſs and ſtrength;
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:010621_0247_0F81B9FACF7F50D0"/>
upon which a perſon will get ſettled upon his leeſe, living upon his graces, light, knowledge and attainments, without grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in grace, or getting further victory over the corruptions and idols of the heart. If a preacher, he will content himſelf with light and gifts, in ſpeaking a word of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without divine love, or the energy of the holy ſpirit penetrating into the heart; ſanctifying and conforming to God's holy law &amp;c. And if a hearer, he will content himſelf with aſſenting to the truth preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and when his caſe is truly diſcribed, conſcience ſaith truth, truth: yet the perſon does not wake up in earneſt, to put them truths into practice; he will be pleaſed in hearing, but not in pain in his heart, for divine ſtrength to do the will of God; he is inclined to lay all over upon the miniſter to do all in public worſhip, and if the miniſter is aſſiſted by the ſpirit of God, to hold forth the truth clearly in ſome demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of truth, he is mightily taken there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with; but if duty is put to him, he is ſhut up, and pinched in his mind, till he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged of that duty; then he is pretty eaſy without the preſence of God, till ſome trying duty preſents, then he is tryed again. Thus in a legal ſpirit, backſliders in heart live and lay a foundation of repentance,
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:010621_0248_0F81B9FC2A560B10"/>
from dead works. Heb. 6, 1. And thus Satan will try upon the right hand and left, to enſnare teachers and hearers, to turn them aſide from living in the life, power, and practice of pure religion, even that which is pure &amp; undefiled before God &amp; the Father. Theſe things brethren I hope you well know, and that it is the will of your Lord &amp; Maſter, that you take forth the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious from the vile, Jer. 15, 19. otherwiſe you have no good foundation to expect to be honoured with, being God's mouth to the people. Be intreated to labour to get a good underſtanding of the laws of Chriſt's houſe, that the church do not admit into their communion, unqualified members thro' your default; that thoſe admitted, live in ſome due meaſure up to their holy profeſſion. Conſult the written word of God, the power and ſpirituality of it, in all the affairs of Chriſt's kingdom, that the wiſdom of God might govern in you, (and not your own.) If any of you ſhould think that I am too rigid in diſcipline, or any of my principles, it is true I am as expoſed to err as any man; but waſting and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeldom comes into Zion upon this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. You brethren do well to take heed that you are not too ſlack, and remiſs, in thoſe important affairs; waſting and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations

has overtook the church of God, from age to age, in this quarter; and I am in fears what will happen to this reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if you that are watchmen, do not wake up in earneſt, and die daily to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; declaring the whole counſels of God to this generation; ſtanding as the valiant of God's ſpiritual Iſrael, with the naked ſword of divine truth always in your hand, and with clean garments free from the blood of all men; which great favour may the Almighty and merciful God grant for Chriſt's ſake, and Zion's ſake, AMEN.</p>
