            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THESE Words are part of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Song,</hi> which Moſes the <hi>Captain General of the Hoſts of Iſrael,</hi> indited by Divine Inſpiration, to expreſs their Gratitude to GOD, and to celebrate His Name &amp; Praiſe, for their <hi>miraculous Deliverance</hi> from the Hands of their enraged Enemies, at the Sea, even at the <hi>Red</hi> Sea.</p>
            <p>This Marvellous work or wonder is often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd to the Honour of GOD's excellent Majeſty both in the Old Teſtament and in the New; and it is a wonderful work to be always remembred by his Church and People to the end of the World; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:003860_0004_100265830B458368"/>
ſince it was Typical of our Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and Spiritual Deliverance by CHRIST the Captain of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>The time would fail me, to give an Hiſtorical Narration of the whole matter. It ſhall ſuffice therefore to obſerve,</p>
            <p>That after the Children of Iſrael had obtain'd leave from Pharaoh their cruel Oppreſſor, to depart out of Egypt, and they had <hi>March'd</hi> to the Borders of His Kingdom; it repented this ambitious Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, and vexed his Soul, that he had conſented thereunto; though he had ſtood it out even to the laſt extremity.</p>
            <p>He reſolves therefore, if poſſible, to bring them back &amp; reinſlave them, or however to be thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reveng'd on them, for thoſe Plagues he had been viſited with upon their account. Accordingly he <hi>Levies</hi> a numerous Army, and muſter'd all his forces of Chariots and Horſemen; for it is thought, he took none of the Foot with him, becauſe the King's Buſineſs required haſte.</p>
            <p>Then does he declare his purpoſes at the Head of his CAVALRY, aſſures them of the Victory before the Engagement, and that his brandiſh'd Sword ſhould reduce the Fugitives, or be Drunk with the Blood of the Slain. Context ver. 9. <hi>The enemy ſaid, I will purſue, I will overtake, I will divide the ſpoil: my luſt ſhall be ſatiſfied upon them, I will draw my ſword, my hand ſhall deſtroy them.</hi> 'Tis delivered in an elegant figure, and beauteous form of Speech, but the matter of it is Proud and Inſolent without a parallel! Surely he had forgot his paſt ſucceſleſs attempts to keep them in Slavery, or that GOD had by his powerful Arm broken their Yoke; and viſited
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:003860_0005_1002060CC929B400"/>
the Egyptians with a ſeries of Judgments, till 'twas thought they themſelves, ſhould be next ſtruck dead by the blow of his Hand. "Or, did he think that GOD's Arm was now ſhortned, that his Weapons were blunted, and that the Magazene of his Plagues was waited, or that his Strength was too weak to preſerve thoſe whom he had Redeemed with an High Hand?" However, his Heart being hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and truſting to his Sword and Militia, he ruſh'd ſwiftly on to his own Deſtruction, as we ſhall ſee in the ſequel.</p>
            <p>It's true, he had now to deal with an unarmed People, unprovided for Defence, and whoſe late Slavery had rendred them unfit for Military Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizes; and although they went out in good order, in <hi>Rank</hi> and <hi>File;</hi> having five in a Rank, as ſome; or in five <hi>Squadrons</hi> as others; yet they were a very unequal Match for a well furniſh'd and diſciplin'd Army. Nevertheleſs Pharaoh had but little reaſon to promiſe himſelf the Victory, and to glory in his ſucceſs beforehand, becauſe Iſrael had the ſame Almighty Power to protect them in their March, that had bro't them out of their Bondage.</p>
            <p>Thus did Siſera's Mother once vainly Triumph in a victorious hope before the Battle of her Son: But though ſhe Sung <hi>Te Deum</hi> before the Conqueſt, yet after the Engagement ſhe chang'd it for the Mournful Notes of <hi>Domine Miſerere Mei!</hi> And it was much like this, but worſe, in the caſe before us!—</p>
            <p>The Egyptian Hoſts purſu'd till they came near to the Iſraelitiſh Armies: who had <hi>encamp'd</hi> by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Order before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the Sea, over againſt Baal-zephon: And when they beheld the Chariots behind them, they were thrown into the greateſt fear and amazement; for
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:003860_0006_100265848D1336B8"/>
they were ſo encompaſs'd on every ſide, that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſeem'd unavoidable.</p>
            <p>They beheld a Deep Sea before them, as ſome ſay, three Leagues over; a numerous and potent Army behind them fir'd with Indignation &amp; Rage; on the one hand was a range of deep and craggy Rocks, and Mountains that were impaſſible; and on the other, as ſome think, Forts and Garriſons upon the Frontiers of Egypt. And in the midſt of themſelves, what a confuſed Noiſe and Murmurs eſpecially among their Women &amp; Children? every Heart panted for fear, and paleneſs ſeiz'd every Face; that, Unarm'd and Defenſeleſs as they were, they ſhould lye at the Mercy of a <hi>Bloody-Tyrant,</hi> and a <hi>Savage Enemy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in <hi>this Mount the Lord was ſeen:</hi> and the People ſtood ſtill to behold the Salvation of the Lord! The GOD of their Fathers commanded Moſes to ſtretch forth his hand over that arm of the Sea; and by a ſtrong Eaſt-wind he cauſed it to go back; He made it as the dry Land, and the Waters were divided. "The Sea ſuffers violence to preſerve GOD's People, and that Liquid Element is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd as it were into a Wall of Braſs."</p>
            <p>GOD Himſelf march'd before them in the Pillar of Fire as their <hi>Leader;</hi> and was in the Pillar of Cloud behind them as their <hi>Rere-ward;</hi> and the Waters were a Wall to them, that the Egyptians might not charge them in the <hi>Flank</hi> either on the <hi>Right or Left:</hi> and they paſs'd ſafely to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſhore.</p>
            <p>The Egyptians being Infatuated, in the heat of their purſuit, went in after them, into the midſt of the Sea; and here they march'd for ſome time as
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:003860_0007_1002658703D552C0"/>
ſafely and triumphantly as Iſrael did; till the Lord <hi>looked</hi> upon their Hoſt and troubled them. Some think that they heard or ſaw ſuch voices or ſight from the Pillar of Cloud, which put them into the greateſt Conſternation, and ſtruck them with a <hi>panic</hi> Fear. They drove on heavily, plung'd almoſt every ſtep, and would fain have Retreated, but 'twas all in vain.</p>
            <p>JEHOVAH is now reſolv'd to be <hi>Eas'd</hi> of his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,</hi> and to be <hi>Aveng'd</hi> on His <hi>Adverſaries:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Hoſts &amp; People of Iſrael, and their Subſtance were ſafely arriv'd on the other ſide; Then did God Command Moſes His Servant again to ſtretch forth his hand; he did ſo, and the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> returned to their place, and overwhelm'd the <hi>whole Egyptian Hoſt,</hi> ſo that not ſo much as one eſcaped. God blew with His Wind, which made the meeting of the Floods more ſwift and boiſterous; and they were ſuddenly and irrecoverably loſt. Context ver. 10. <hi>Thou didſt blow with thy wind, the ſea covered them: they ſank as lead in the mighty waters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come ſee what fearful Deſolations the Lord has made! The former Plagues were but ſmaller wounds in the Aegyptian ſtate, but now the glory, power and ſtrength of Egypt, are buried in the Sea to their utter ruin.</p>
            <p>The Iſraelites ſaw their Bodies afterwards ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd upon the Sea ſhore numerous as the ſands: This Tragical Spectacle greatly affected the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; as well as the wondrous Mercy they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd at God's Hand: They were now aſhamed of their paſt Murmurs &amp; Unbelief, &amp; were reſolv'd to truſt in the Name of the Lord, and to <hi>Magnify</hi> their God for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:003860_0008_1002061263848780"/>
To aſſiſt them in this Duty, Moſes the Man of GOD, pens This Divine Song, which is a PANIGYRIC to the praiſe of GOD's Power in their Salvation, and of his Victory over their Enemies. Moſes led in the ſacred Anthem; the whole Aſſembly joins him in it; and how harmonious the Sound, how ſincere and exalted the Praiſe?</p>
            <p>And as it was deſign'd to give that glory to GOD which was due to his Name; ſo to Him he directs it, under a Name and Title ſuited to the great oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion; as in the words read, <hi>The LORD is a Man of War;</hi> the Lord is his Name Which intimates that the LORD JEHOVAH is moſt ſkilful powerful and ſucceſſful in all his Engagements againſt His and his People's Enemies.—The phraſe a <hi>Man of War</hi> is deſcriptive of an <hi>eminent and compleat War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior; moſt expert and valiant in Wars and Battles.</hi> It is a form of Speech uſual in the Scripture, as Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters ſhew us. Thus a Man of Eloquence, of a ſoft and fluent Tongue, is call'd a Man of Words, Exod. 10. 4. <hi>And Moſes ſaid unto the Lord, O my Lord; I am not Eloquent; or a Man of Words,</hi> as the Margin has it according to the Original. So a Strong and Mighty Man, is called a Man of Arm, Job 22. 8 <hi>But as for the Mighty Man &amp;c.</hi> the Margin preſerves the Hebraiſm and reads it, the <hi>Man of Arm;</hi> as if he was all Arm, Strength and Power. And thus a <hi>Man of War,</hi> denotes an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd, expert, couragious &amp; victorious Warrior, 1 Sam. 17. 33. <hi>Thou art but a Youth, and He a Man of War from his Youth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſome ſuppoſe that the expreſſion, <hi>a Man of War,</hi> being applied to the Lord Jehovah, does intimate that JESUS CHRIST who is Man as well as GOD, is intended in the Words. However that be, ſo it is indeed, that He is the Captain of our

Salvation, the Captain of the LORD's Hoſts, and victorious over his Enemies. Joſhua beheld him at Jericho, in the <hi>form of a Man</hi> with a Sword drawn in his Hand; and when He enquired who he was &amp;c. He anſwered that He was Prince or <hi>Captain of the Hoſts of the LORD:</hi> and as ſuch, He fell on his face and worſhipped Him John the beloved Diſciple in his viſions of Him, ſaw a Two-edged Sword proceeding out of His Mouth, and on his Veſture and on his Thigh a Name writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and the <hi>Armies following after Him.</hi> Iſaiah beheld Him with his Prophetical Eye, in His Triumphant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from his Conqueſts, and Victory over his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, Iſai. 63 init. <hi>Who is This that cometh from Edom, with d<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Doctrinal Obſervation from the Words may be this,</p>
            <p>DOCT. <hi>That the LORD GOD of Iſrael, is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minently a Man of War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in the management of this point, I ſhall attempt,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To ſay what is contained in This Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Almighty; or inſtance in ſeveral things, wherein it evidently appears, that GOD the LORD is by way of eminence, a Man of War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall briefly apply the truth in ſome uſeful Inferences and Reflections; and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:003860_0010_1002658B03FCEF60"/>
with a view to the occaſional Solemnities and Military Actions of the Day.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>I am to ſay what is contain'd in this deſcription of the Almighty, that He is a Man of War; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in ſeveral Things, wherein it evidently appears and manifeſts it ſelf.</hi> And this may be done in the ſeveral following particulars, which may ſuffice to illuſtrate the truth.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>The LORD is eminently a Man of War, as He is the Chief and abſolute Monarch &amp;</hi> Commander of all the Creatures <hi>which He has made.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The LORD He is GOD; He hath made all Things, and for His Pleaſure and Glory they are and were Created. He uttered forth the Word of his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty <hi>Flat</hi> and all things ſtarted into Being. He hath made the Heavens, yea the Heaven of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens with all their Hoſts, the Earth and all that is thereon, and the great and wide Sea, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable things that are therein.</p>
            <p>And as it is His Divine Prerogative upon this account, ſo GOD is the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> and <hi>only Potentate,</hi> His Kingdom is an Everlaſting Kingdom; and His Dominion ruleth over ALL.—</p>
            <p>The <hi>Glorious Armies of Heaven</hi> above; the Wiſe and Mighty Angels of His preſence, which are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly His Hoſts; and the <hi>innumerable Inhabitants of the Earth;</hi> and the <hi>forlorn Regions of the Prince of Darkneſs,</hi> his principalities and powers, are all under His Commands or Reſtraints, and at His ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Diſpoſal. "Of the former of theſe, God has <hi>ſtanding</hi> Armies that were never diſbanded: regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and well Diſciplin'd Troops, that are always ready, never at a loſs, never Mutiny; they are <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terane</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:003860_0011_1002658D8BEE3AD0"/>
Soldiers, that have been long in His Service; and ſo victorious that they never fail'd of Succeſs, and never will, while they Obey the voice of their King and God."</p>
            <p>And not only rational and moral Agents, but the <hi>Animate and Inanimate World</hi> are governed and employed by Him.</p>
            <p>The Beaſts and Birds, all Inſects, and Reptiles, and the numerous Things that creep in the Sea; and even the fiercer <hi>Crocodile,</hi> and the invulnerable <hi>Leviathan</hi> belong to his Hoſts and Armies.</p>
            <p>So the Light and Darkneſs, Fire &amp; Hail, Snow and Vapour, Thunder and Lightning, Stormy Wind and Tempeſts, are all of his Divine Artillery, and he makes them Inſtruments in his Hand, to the Vexation &amp; Deſtruction of his Enemies when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſees meet.</p>
            <p>He ſent forth a <hi>Detachment</hi> from moſt of theſe <hi>Regiments,</hi> againſt the People and Kingdom of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and they were conſumed and devoured by them. And the Scriptures furniſh us with many other inſtances of this kind, which I ſtay not now to mention.</p>
            <p>Upon this account then, the LORD may be call'd by way of eminence a Man of War; as all the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Creatures above and below, from the <hi>Higheſt Angel</hi> to the moſt contemptible <hi>Worm,</hi> yea to the moſt neglected <hi>Plant</hi> and <hi>Vapour,</hi> are at His Diſpoſe. No wonder then that Bildad demanded as he did, Job 25. 3. <hi>Is there any number of his armies?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>GOD is the abſolute Monarch of the Univerſe, the Leader and Commander of the Creatures; they all
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:003860_0012_10020617330A1210"/>
obey the Voice of his Word, and obſerve and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the Commands and Orders which he gives forth from his exalted Throne.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lord is eminently a Man of War, as</hi> He diſpoſes Men's Hearts to engage in Wars &amp; <hi>Battles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Hearts of all Men are in the Hands of GOD; He turns them which way ſo ever He pleaſes, and over rules them, to ſerve His great Ends and Purpoſes, his Glory &amp; Deſigns in the World, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be the Hearts of His Friends, or of His Enemies. But GOD's Hand is more eſpecially ſeen, or his Permiſſion granted, in the Provocations to Wars and Battles among Men. When their Minds are taken off from Peace and Amity, and they are diſpos'd to Contend in a Field of Blood, and have their Cabinet Councels, to contrive, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare and execute the Stratagems of War.</p>
            <p>Thus it was from the LORD JEHOVAH, that <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's Heart was ſo hardned againſt</hi> GOD and His People, as to go forth to Battle againſt them; but it was becauſe GOD had purpos'd to deſtroy him and his <hi>gallant</hi> Armies.—And it was of GOD that Rehoboam was ſo invariably ſet to hearken to the Councel of his young and giddy Cavaliers, and to turn a deaf ear to the Sage Advice of his venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and experienc'd Councellors; that GOD might rend ten Tribes from him, that would riſe up in Arms againſt Him.—It was alſo of GOD, that Ahab, was ſo immoveably fixed, to go to War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Ramoth-Gilead, that he might be wounded and fall in the Field of Battle.</p>
            <p>GOD as the Governour of the World, has great and ſecret Deſigns to carry on in the Earth; and He is pleas'd often to do it, in the Bloody ſcenes
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:003860_0013_1002658F0FD665C8"/>
of War. When a People have ſin'd againſt Him and provoked Him by their Inventions; He raiſes up another Nation as a Rod of His Anger to puniſh them; and in their turn He takes the Rod &amp; burns it in the ſame flames. Agreeably we read of GOD's influence in matters of War in His Word, I Chron. 5 22 <hi>And there fell down many ſlain, becauſe the war was of GOD.</hi> And again, Jer. 25. 39 <hi>Ye ſhall not be unpuniſhed: for I will call for a ſword, ſaith the LORD of hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that upon this account alſo, and from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which Almighty GOD has in diſpoſing Men; Nations or particular Perſons to Wars and Battles, He may eminently be called a Man of War; <hi>as well as the GOD of the ſpirits of all fleſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Lord is eminently a Man of War, as</hi> He muſters the Forces together, and leads them as their General into the Field of Battle.</p>
            <p>GOD not only diſpoſes Mens Minds to Wars and Contentions, but <hi>muſters</hi> them together for the Field of Battle: He raiſes their Forces and collects their numerous Armies <hi>principal</hi> and <hi>auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liary.</hi> Iſai. 13. 4. <hi>The Lord of hoſts muſtereth the Hoſt of the Battle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men indeed act freely and according to their Minds and Counſels in theſe Affairs; nor is there any neceſſity laid upon them by the divine Will and Purpoſes; yet, the Finger of GOD muſt be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged in ſo great an Event as this. No Army could be rais'd, no Regiments or Battalions drawn up in the Seat of Action, if He that was not the LORD General of the Hoſts of the Univerſe did not call for them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:003860_0014_10026592805C2DA8"/>
If we look into the <hi>Book of the Wars of the Lord,</hi> and conſider the Story of the Engagements of his ancient People, we may eaſily ſee a ſpecial Hand of Divine Providence therein, and that in the very beginnings of the War; as raiſing Forces, muſtering Armies, giving Orders &amp;c. Iſai. 5. 26. <hi>And he will lift up an Enſign to the Nations from far, and will hiſs unto them from the end of the Earth; and behold they ſhall come with ſpeed ſwiftly.</hi> If Almighty GOD did but give an <hi>Hiſs</hi> or a <hi>Nod,</hi> or the leaſt intimation of His Sovereign Mind in this caſe, the Cry would immediately be, <hi>to Arms, to Arms.</hi> If GOD does but lift up His <hi>Enſign</hi> and <hi>Standard,</hi> vaſt and numerous Armies, a fierce and formidable Hoſt ſhall draw near to his Banner, ready to hear the words of Command, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute His Pleaſure.</p>
            <p>That was juſtly eſteem'd a proud and arrogant Speech in <hi>Pompey,</hi> when one of his Officers told him they wanted Men: Let me, ſays he, but ſtamp my foot on the Ground of Italy, then I ſhall have Men eno', Horſemen and Foot-men from every Corner; and when he attempted it, he was ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully diſappointed. But not ſo with the LORD of Hoſts and the GOD of Armies; let Him but liſp the Word, or ſignify His Sovereign Pleaſure; and to Him will the <hi>gathering</hi> of the People be, they will March with ſpeed, ſwiftly to fight the LORD's Battles.—</p>
            <p>But then GOD Almighty comes Himſelf as the GENERALISSIMO into the Field with his People. He not only muſters the Hoſt, but leads them forth, and ſets them in <hi>Battle Array.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes indeed He leads the Enemies of His People againſt them, to puniſh them for their
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:003860_0015_1002061C058D3BF0"/>
apoſtacies and rebellions againſt Him; but uſually He is with His People as their Chief Commander, to lead them on to, and to direct and encourage them in, their Martial Actions and Enterprizes. This was the encouragement which the Prieſts were directed to give GOD's People of old, when they were engaging in Battle, Deut. 20. 3, 4. <hi>Hear O Iſrael, you approach this day to battle againſt your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: let not your hearts faint, fear not and do not tremble, neither he ye terrified becauſe of them:</hi> The reaſon follows, <hi>For the LORD your GOD is he that goeth with you, to fight for you againſt your enemies, to ſave you. i. e.</hi> He will be your GENERAL at the Head of your Armies to lead you on againſt your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and to make you victorious over them.</p>
            <p>And how Gloriouſly did He march before His People Iſrael when he brought them out of the Houſe of their Bondage? Was it poſſible they ſhould ever have obtained ſo many Victories as they did over ſuch Puiſſant Enemies, with their Chariots of Iron, if the LORD of Hoſts had not been in their Front, and fought their Battles for them? And it is His Preſence and Influence that makes their Arms proſperous. Zech. 10. 5. <hi>And they ſhall be as mighty men which tread down their enemies as the mire of the ſtreets in the battel, and they ſhall fight becauſe the LORD is with them, and the riders on horſes ſhall be confounded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, according to the Military ſtile, the LORD is alſo their LIEUTENANT-GENERAL; He is not only in the Front but in the Rear to ſecure and defend them. Iſa. 52. 12. <hi>For the LORD will go before you: and the GOD of Iſrael will be your Rere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> And thus He was in the Pillar of Cloud betwixt the Egyptians and Iſraelites, when Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh and his hoſt, were about to attack them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:003860_0016_10020604A18855D8"/>
Surely that Army that has Almighty GOD both in the Front and Rear, muſt be call'd <hi>Invincible;</hi> they muſt needs be ſafe, proſper and prevail.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The LORD is eminently a Man of War, as</hi> He Inſtructs the People in the Art and Myſtery of War, and endows them with Martial Skill and Valour.</p>
            <p>The LORD <hi>inſtructs</hi> the People in the <hi>Art of War.</hi> He led them firſt into the diſcovery of the Rules and Methods of it; He enables them to apply them and to improve upon them: and when any are excellently well skill'd therein, in all their Military Exerciſes, Poſtures, Encampments, Engagements, &amp;c. they are Taught &amp; Inſtructed by the LORD. Pſal. 144. I. <hi>Bleſſed be the LORD my ſtrength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then GOD directs in every Deſign, and ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts ſuch <hi>politic Counſels,</hi> that the moſt expert Warriors could not invent or guard againſt. Other Generals have their Counſels of War upon Emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, to adviſe, encourage and ſtrengthen one another: But the LORD of Hoſts the Wonderful Counſellor, has all Wiſdom and Counſel in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and Communicates of them to all that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Him.—The LORD accounts it his Glory, that He teaches the Plowman, to open and break the clods of the Earth, and to Sow his Seed, &amp;c. But how much greater is his Glory to give Wiſdom and Skill to Order and lead forth Armies, for their Safety, Defence and Victory? This cometh from the GOD of Armies, who is <hi>wonderful in Counſel, and excellent in Working.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the other ſide, it is the LORD alſo that takes away Counſel, and defeats the Deſigns againſt his
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:003860_0017_10026596DF8B2E18"/>
People; ſo he turned the Counſel of crafty Achito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel into folliſhneſs. GOD beſotts them in their Conſultations, mingles a perverſe deceitful Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men, and ſcatters darkneſs in their paths, ſo that their Counſels are turned upſide down, and they are ſnared in the work of their own hands. Iſa. 19. 11. <hi>Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counſel of the wiſe counſellors of Pharoah is become bruitiſh. The princes of Noph are deceived, they have alſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Egypt:</hi> And we ſee the fatal iſſue of it in the caſe that has been mentioned.</p>
            <p>But then as the LORD gives Wiſdom and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, ſo He gives <hi>Courage and Proweſs</hi> in War. Then are Some mighty Men of Valour; they face the greateſt Dangers, and out-brave the King of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors himſelf, marching in his moſt frightful Forms againſt them. When the Spirit of the LORD came upon Sampſon, Gideon and others, what valiant Soldiers were they, and how great their exploits? They ſubdued Kingdoms, ſtopped the Mouths of Lions, out of Weakneſs were made Strong, waxed valiant in Fight, and turn'd to flight the Armies of the Aliens. Were there ever more brave and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted Spirits, more reſolute, heroic and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Warriours? Verily there is no Valour like That of GOD's infuſing.</p>
            <p>But then as the LORD gives a Spirit of Courage and Puiſſance, ſo <hi>He takes it away:</hi> Then the ſtouteſt Champions become the greateſt Cowards, and their Hearts melt and ſink within them, ſo that they flee even before a Leaf ſhaken with the Wind, and are affrighted at their own ſhadows. Iſai. 19. 16. <hi>In that day ſhall Egypt be like unto Women; and it ſhall be afraid and fear, becauſe of the ſhaking of the hand of the Lord of hoſts which he ſhaketh over it.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:003860_0018_1002659A569F7548"/>
So that upon this account alſo the LORD may be called <hi>a Man of War,</hi> as He inſtructs the People in the Art and Myſtery of it, directs their Counſels, and endows them with Martial Skill and Valour; ſo that they are expert in War, and mighty in Battle.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>The LORD is eminently a Man of War, as</hi> He hath the abſolute diſpoſals of all the Weapons in the Day of Battle.</p>
            <p>Altho' He endows Men with Wiſdom &amp; Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to make the Inſtruments of War, and Skill and Courage to uſe the Martial Weapons; yet He reſerves to Himſelf the Prerogative to diſpoſe of them as to the Event. All the <hi>Weapons</hi> uſed by the Sons of War, and the moſt formidable preparations of the ſtrongeſt Armado, ſhall be of uſe only ſo far as the Lord pleaſeth. Agreable to this is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe which God made to his ancient People, Iſai. 54. 17. <hi>No weapon that is formed againſt thee ſhall proſper.</hi> i. e. If any be pointed at thee, tho' never ſo ſkilfully managed, it ſhall not harm thee: It ſhall miſs the Mark, fall out of the Hand of your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or recoil upon them to their own Wounding and Hurt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Swords</hi> and <hi>Spears</hi> in the Hand of the moſt vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, ſhall be but as the feeble Reeds and Straws, unleſs GOD give them a Commiſſion to devour and deſtroy: And when He lifts up his Voice, a blaſt of Rams Horns, and the ratling of broken Pitchers, ſhall do more Execution, and demoliſh Walls and Caſtles more effectually, than <hi>Battering Rams,</hi> the <hi>Roaring Canon, Bombs</hi> or <hi>Granados.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we have ſometimes heard, that an Army has been miſerably defeated, that was admirably
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003860_0019_100206230EDDF438"/>
well equip'd, and prepar'd with Martial Engines and Weapons of War; and tho' they ſtil'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Invincible; Their Arms and Artillery, their Gallies and Fire Ships, their floating Caſtles and Batteries, did not anſwer their name. GOD diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed them; they were aſhamed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, defeated &amp; ſcattered. This is the LORD's doings and ſhould be marvellous in our eyes! Who is like unto the LORD among the Gods, who is like unto Him? Fearful in Praiſes, working Wonders. He Governs theſe Events without controul. <hi>He breaks the bow in pieces, cuts the ſpears in ſunder, burns the chariots in the fire; and will have all the Armies know that He is GOD:</hi> That the Lives of all are in His Hand; and that the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons form'd againſt them ſhall proſper or be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, according to His Sovereign Purpoſes and Will.</p>
            <p>The Bow drawn at a venture, and the Gun diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charg'd without ſight, are directed by the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of GOD. So that in Life and Death none may ſay, a Chance has happen'd to them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The LORD is eminently a Man of War, as</hi> He cauſes it to Continue or Ceaſe whenever He pleaſes.</p>
            <p>Thus Sovereign is Almighty GOD in the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the grand Affairs of War.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Sword ſhall not be drawn till He gives the the Word of Command;</hi> and when it is unſheath'd it ſhall not be return'd into it's Scab-board till He requires it. This is deſcrib'd by the Prophet, Jer. 47. 6, 7. <hi>O thou ſword of the LORD, how long will it be ere thou be quiet? put up thy ſelf into thy ſcabbard, reſt and be ſtill.</hi> The reply is, <hi>How can it be quiet, ſeeing the LORD hath given it a charge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

Aſhkelon, and againſt the ſea ſhore? There hath he appointed it.</hi>

            <p>And it ſhall <hi>abide</hi> upon a People till it has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh'd the ends for which it was ſent. Hoſ. 11 6. <hi>And the ſword ſhall abide on his cities, and conſume his branches, and devour them, becauſe of their own counſels.</hi> How long a Time Wars ſhall continue in a Land when the Bloody Scene is opened, or when they ſhall ceaſe, and be turned into Peace, is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the appointment of the LORD of Hoſts. His Providence works in continuing the hoſtile ſpirit, in <hi>upholding Parties,</hi> in <hi>bringing in Supplies and Recruits</hi> in <hi>breaking aſunder Leagues and Treaties,</hi> and in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing the provocations to the War, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We are apt to look at Men altogether in the continuance of a War; now though it be true that Their haughty ſpirit, and mutual Provocations, are the Secondary cauſes both of the beginning and continuance of War, yet there is an over-ruling Providence, diſpoſing and ordering theſe things, for wiſe and good, though it may be, ſecret ends and purpoſes.</p>
            <p>As the War begins in the day that GOD has fixed, ſo it concludes at the time that He has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and till that happy Period arrives, all <hi>Negotiations for Peace,</hi> and the Accommodation of differences among the Nations will be fruitleſs and ineffectual. But when GOD ſays, it is enough; then the Sword ſhall be ſheath'd again, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Angel return to render an account of the ſlain, unto the LORD of Life and Glory.</p>
            <p>Here then we may alſo further obſerve, that God <hi>puts a period to War,</hi> or ſometimes <hi>marvellouſly prevents it,</hi> as He at other Times calls into the Field

            <p>GOD ſounds a Retreat, calls off the Nations from oppoſing and deſtroying one another, and disbands the moſt furious Armies. Hence that is part of GOD's royal Character, Pſal. 65. 7. <hi>Which ſtilleth the Noiſe of the Seas, the Noiſe of their Waves, and the Tumult of the People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have a ſurprizing Inſtance of GOD's Power and Influence in preventing of War and Blood-ſhed in the caſe of Rehoboam, recorded I <hi>King.</hi> 12. 21. We have not the like in all the Book of God; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any thing to be compar'd unto it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore or ſince in the Earth.</p>
            <p>King Rehoboam was greatly incenſed againſt the Tribes that fell off from him: He was in as great a Rage and Ferment as we may ſuppoſe a Furioſo to be rais'd into; and the Flame was blown up to the Heighth by the heady &amp; unexperienc'd Courtiers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him. He had rais'd an Army ſtrong eno'; an Hundred &amp; Fourſcore Thouſand Men; a Mighty Hoſt this! muſter'd to reduce the revolting Tribes, and to bring the Kingdom again entire to the Houſe of David. Their Power was great; fierce was their Rage; the goodneſs of their Cauſe they queſtion'd not; and they were going forth with the moſt cruel Intentions; and who ſhall Let them? Who can ſtand before and prevent them?—This the LORD of Hoſt did by a Word; ſhewing Himſelf to be a Man of War in a wondrous manner. He
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003860_0022_10020628A59CB920"/>
               <hi>ſent them an order to lay down their Arms;</hi> Power went forth with His Word; <hi>they immediately obey and retreat;</hi> nor Prince nor People oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>The account is this, <hi>The word of God came unto Shemaiah the man of God, ſaying, Speak unto Rehoboam the ſon of Solomon king of Judah, and unto all the houſe of Judah and Benjamin, and to the remnant of the people, ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, Ye ſhall not go up, nor fight againſt your brethren the children of Iſrael: return every man to his houſe, for this thing is from me. They hearkened therefore to the word of the Lord, and returned to depart according to the word of the Lord.</hi> What a mighty Work of God was this! What Power hath He over the Hearts of Men? Yea of the Greateſt, who think it an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferable Diſhonour to be controuled or defeated in any thing they have ſet their Hearts upon.</p>
            <p>GOD by His Omnipotent Arm daſhes the moſt daring Deſigns in pieces. He quelleth the proud Spirits of the moſt furious Nimrods, and reduces the foaming Billows of Wars and Tumults, into the moſt perfect and delightful Calm and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility. Once more,</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>The LORD is eminently a Man of War,</hi> as He over-rules the great Events of it, and gives Succeſs and Victory to whomſoever He pleaſes.</p>
            <p>A Horſe is a vain thing for ſafety; and ſo is a Coat of Mail, or the keeneſt Armour: Tho' Men be never ſo well equip'd and prepar'd for the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, <hi>Salvation is of the Lord.</hi> How frequently are Men deceiv'd and miſtaken in their Hopes &amp; Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, as to the Succeſs of this and the other Battle and Engagement, whilſt they don't conſider the over-ruling Hand of GOD, and His Sovereignty
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:003860_0023_1002659E920D0860"/>
in the caſe. The vaſt numbers of the Hoſt, the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Armament, Ammunition &amp; Artillery, the Skill &amp; Puiſſance of the Generals, &amp; the Courage and Dexterity of the Soldiers, all ſignify nothing to depend upon, as to the Iſſue and Event.</p>
            <p>That's a Maxim of Wiſdom and Truth. Eccl. 9. 11. <hi>The race is not to the ſwift, nor the battle to the ſtrong.</hi> And if the LORD be on their ſide, one ſhall chaſe a thouſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight. GOD can by weak and contemptible means overthrow the greateſt Powers &amp; Strength. Hence let not him boaſt that puts on his Harneſs, any more than he that puts it off.</p>
            <p>GOD determines that ſuch ſhall go up, and be ſlain in ſuch an high place of the Field; or fall in ſuch a skirmiſh and attack: and of others He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to cover their Heads in the day of Battle, that not an Hair of them ſhall fall to the ground; He gives them their Life for a Prey.</p>
            <p>And ſo as to Victory in reſpect of the Action of the main Body, <hi>That</hi> alſo is ordered of the LORD. The Battle is the LORD's, and to <hi>what Nation or Armies ſoever He wills the Victory, to them it ſhall be given.</hi> Thouſands ſhall fall down at their ſide; Ten Thouſand at their right Hand: They ſhall ſhout with the Voice of Triumph; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with their Captives and their Spoils, and be exalted in the Songs; and be crown'd with the Honours of their King, and the Acclamations of their People.</p>
            <p>Thus HE that formed all Things, and ruleth over all; He that Thunders in the Clouds, that holds the Winds in his Fiſt, and the Ocean in the Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of his Hand, that meaſures the Earth with a
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003860_0024_100265A10BC18968"/>
Span, and weighs the Mountains in Balances; He that ſits on the Circle of the Earth, does ſway the Sceptre among the Nations; and eſpecially orders and influences the great Affairs of Wars and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions among them, wherein the Lives, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Happineſs of his Creatures, and of his People, are very nearly concerned.</p>
            <p>And thus, I conceive, from the Hints that have been given, it appears that the Title of <hi>a Man of War</hi> is fitly given to the LORD GOD of Iſrael. We have ſeen wherein it conſiſts, and many of the Inſtances and Particulars wherein it manifeſts it ſelf. And by this I ſuppoſe the Doctrinal Truth is ſufficiently confirmed and illuſtrated. I proceed in the next place,</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Briefly to apply the Truth in ſome Uſeful Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and Reflections;</hi> more eſpecially for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the <hi>Militia</hi> in our Land.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>We ſee ſomething of the</hi> Majeſty and Glory of the GOD of Iſrael, <hi>for which He is</hi> greatly to be feared and praiſed by His People.</p>
            <p>As He is the Almighty Maker of Heaven and Earth; and the Sovereign Ruler and Diſpoſer of all things in His Holy Providence; particularly as He has the Government of Wars and Fightings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Nations; in the management of which He diſcovers His Infinite Wiſdom, irreſiſtible Power, Unſpotted Holineſs, Boundleſs Goodneſs, Perfect Righteouſneſs, and the other Glorious Perfections of the Divine Nature.</p>
            <p>With what <hi>Terrible Majeſty</hi> and inſufferable Glory does the LORD Himſelf appear at the Head of all the Armies of the Univerſe; an innumerable Hoſt
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:003860_0025_1002062D6F3E1208"/>
conſiſting of all the Creatures? They are all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious to Him, waiting His Commands; a Nod of His Head, or the Beckning of His Hand, will inſtantly move whole Battalions and Regiments, as well as particular Species and Individuals.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Great is our GOD, and greatly to be Praiſed, who will not fear before Him, and worſhip His Holy Name?</hi> But who can declare the mighty Acts of the LORD, who can ſhew forth all His Praiſe? not one. The Tongue of <hi>Michael</hi> or <hi>Gabriel</hi> would faulter and fail in the attempt. This is the KING OF GLORY; and if you inquire who He is, and why He is ſo called; I ſhall anſwer with the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 24. 8. 10. <hi>The LORD ſtrong and mighty, the LORD mighty in battel. The LORD of Hoſts, He is the King of Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let all His Creatures, all His Hoſts and Armies Praiſe Him, in Heaven, in Earth, and in all deep Places, as they are exhorted to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We ſee hence the</hi> Lawfulneſs of War, and of the Military Art.</p>
            <p>The LORD is a Man of War; and ſo may and ſhould His People be, who are part of His Forces, whenever they are call'd to engage therein; then they ſhould approve themſelves Skilful and Vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, for the LORD of Hoſts.</p>
            <p>In ſome caſes, and for ſome reaſons, it is both Lawful and a Duty, to take up Arms and go forth to War; and it is neceſſary for Men to ſtudy the Military Act and to acquire a Martial Genius and Spirit, that they may either turn the Battle to the Gate, and raiſe the Siege; or Invade a Foreign E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, and Couragiouſly encamp againſt them. It
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:003860_0026_100265A4AE0D3328"/>
is Lawful to take up Arms in the Defence of our Lives and Eſtates, to guard our Religious and Civil Liberties, and to take juſt Revenges on thoſe that have cruelly Slain our Neighbours and carried into Captivity our Friends. This we ſee in the example of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who had a Trained Band in his Houſe; in that he purſued thoſe that had ſpoiled his Kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Lot, and led him and his Family into Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity: and by force of Arms reſcu'd him and his out of their Hands.</p>
            <p>There is no Prohibition in Scripture againſt a Military Profeſſion; were there, ſays the great PEMBERTON, Why did not the Baptiſt <hi>disband</hi> the Soldiers that came unto him and demanded of him, What they ſhould do? And why did not our LORD and Maſter <hi>deplume</hi> the Centurion, that came unto Him? Why did He not Command him to lay down his Commiſſion, as inconſiſtent with that Faith which in Iſrael it ſelf had not a parellel. Thus He.</p>
            <p>"That God has not forbid a People (in caſe of Neceſſity and where amicable Means will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail) to maintain their own Safety and Welfare, even by an armed Violence, againſt ſuch as wrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully invade them; or to aſſiſt their Neighbours in ſuch a Caſe, is plain from the Laws of Humanity and Self-preſervation, as well as from the permiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and encouragement given to Wars in the Jewiſh Polity; which was Inſtituted by God, who was their Lawgiver and King." But I need not inſiſt on a Point ſo clear as this.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Since GOD is ſtiled a Man of War, the Office of a Soldier ſhould be eſteemed</hi> an honourable Profeſſion and Employment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:003860_0027_100206323B4C5410"/>
As the Eſtate of Marriage is much honour'd, in that CHRIST is pleas'd to expreſs that great My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Goſpel, the bleſſed Union betwixt Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf &amp; His Church by it: So the Calling of a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier or Warrior is much honoured by this, that GOD Himſelf is ſtiled a Man of War, and ſo often takes upon Him the Title of the <hi>Lord of Hoſts,</hi> and <hi>God of Armies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have but now ſaid, that the LORD of Hoſts is the King of Glory; and ſurely ſome of His <hi>Glory will ſhine and reſt upon thoſe Soldiers,</hi> that ſerve un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Him, and are like unto Him. The Roman's honour'd a Soldier much, and the Latin calls a Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier and a Knight by the ſame name.</p>
            <p>It was an Obſervation of the Learned Dr. COTTON MATHER, that it was made an Act among the Warlike Spartans, that no Man ſhould have an Epitaph, or ſo much as his Name written upon his Grave, if he had not been a Soldier; that ſome of the chief Dignitary Titles now in the World had a Military Riſe; and that the Soldiers in King David and King Solomon's Times, were reckoned the <hi>Worthies</hi> of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And indeed, many Monuments in Scripture are rais'd to their Honour that were remarkable for their Martial Skill, Valour and Exploits; their Names are mentioned with Characters of Praiſe, they are conſecrated to Poſterity, and the ſmell thereof is fragrant as the precious Ointment; and when they Dye in the Bed of Honour, their Names are had in Everlaſting Remembrance.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Since the Holy GOD is ſtiled a Man of War</hi> all Soldiers and Men of War ſhould be Holy.</p>
            <p>

In our Context after GOD is Magnify'd as triumphing gloriouſly over His and His People's Enemies; He is, <hi>ver.</hi> II. ſaid to be, <hi>Glorious in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</hi> It is very remarkable that GOD's Holineſs in the Sacred Oracles is frequently joyned with His Title of the LORD of Hoſts. Iſa. 47. 4. <hi>As for our Redeemer, the LORD of Hoſts is his Name, the holy One of Iſrael.</hi> So when the Cherubims and Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims, are Magnifying His Glory, in their exalted and unceaſing Reſponſes, they cry out, as Iſa. 6. 3. <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of Hoſts.</hi> And becauſe the <hi>Great General is Holy, ſo ſhould all His Hoſts, His</hi> Officers and Soldiers <hi>be.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been the cuſtom of Soldiers to endeavour to imitate their General in any thing; yea in their very Imperfections. ALEXANDER's Soldiers counted it a graceful Mein to hold their Heads on one ſide, becauſe Alexander their General did ſo. But with an <hi>how much more,</hi> ſhould Chriſtian Soldiers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to be like the LORD of Hoſts, in that which is his greateſt Excellency and Glory; and which will caſt a peculiar Luſtre &amp; Glory on them. Such will find, that Holineſs and Valour are not only conſiſtent with one another, but ſubſervient to each other, even in Men of Arms. It is a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maxim of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> that Religion makes Men Cowards. The moſt Valiant Soldiers in the Earth, have been moſt eminent for their Religion &amp; Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. It is true to a Proverb, Prov. 28.

            <p>I ſuppoſe, ſays the ingenuous SYMMES, that the Sun never ſhone on three braver Warriors, than Abraham, Joſhua, and David; and yet who more renowned for the Power of Godlineſs than theſe Worthies? Cornelius a Roman Captain was

            <p>PLUTARCH tells us of a Theban Band of Soldiers, which they call'd the holy Band, in which there was more Confidence put than in any, becauſe they proſpered above others. The holy GOD who walks in the midſt of the Hoſts and Armies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Holineſs in them, Deut. 23. 9, 14. <hi>When the Hoſt goeth forth againſt thine Enemies, then keep thee from every wicked thing: For the Lord thy God walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the midſt of the Camp; therefore ſhall thy Camp be holy; that he ſee no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee.</hi> This is that <hi>Divine Wiſdom,</hi> of which Eccleſiaſtes ſpeaks, <hi>that is better than Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>We ſee hence where</hi> Soldiers muſt repair for, and to whom they muſt give the Glory of their Military Skill, Valour &amp; Succeſs in Wars. <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>To the GOD of Armies,</hi> who is eminently a Man of War.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen ſomething intended in this Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and find that a Martial Skill and Genius, Spirit and Courage, Conduct and Stratagems in War, do all come down from the Father of Lights, who is the giver of every good and perfect Gift.</p>
            <p>Thoſe then that profeſs themſelves Soldiers, ſhould give <hi>Thanks</hi> to Him, for the diſcovery of the Military Science, which is ſo neceſſary to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Men with the methods of Safety and Defence againſt an Invading Enemy, &amp;c.</p>

as poſſibly they can, and that hereby they may make full proof of their Armour.—</p>
            <p>And in the <hi>Uſe of Means,</hi> they ſhould have their Eye and <hi>Prayer</hi> lifted up to the LORD of Hoſts, that He would ſucceed their Studies &amp; Exerciſes; that He would teach their Hands to War, and their Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Fight, and make them Men of valour and Men of renown in their day, becauſe of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flciency, expertneſs and proweſs therein.—</p>
            <p>And if any do excel in this Martial Skill, and are very dexterous &amp; active in their Military Exerciſes; or are fired with a magnanimous Spirit and Puiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance; and have been Succeſsful and Victorious in a day of Battle: they ſhould <hi>Religiouſly Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice the Praiſe of all to GOD,</hi> for to Him does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertain. He that teaches the loweſt Husband man his Art, teaches the greateſt General his Skill; and it is by His Bleſſing they are both ſucceeded.</p>
            <p>To rob GOD of this Glory, is very provoking to Him; the King of Aſſyria is threatned with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction for it. Iſa. 10. 12, 13. <hi>I will puniſh the fruit of the ſtout heart of the king of Aſſyria, and the glory of his high looks. For he ſaith, By the ſtrength of my hand I have done it, and by my wiſdom; and I have put down the inhabitants like a valiant man.</hi>

greateſt and moſt terrible Judgments wherewith He has been won't to puniſh a rebellious People.</p>
            <p>So amazing was it in the apprehenſion of David, tho' a man of War, and moſt expert and valiant in it, that he choſe rather the Peſtilence ſhould break in upon his People, than their bloody Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; tho' they were to be deſtroyed by them but for three Months, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24. 13, 14.

            <p>Should I enter upon a Detail of the Miſeries of it, <hi>where</hi> ſhould I begin, and <hi>when</hi> ſhould I end.

the parts of the Military Art.</hi> That You may all to a Man, from the higheſt Field-Officer to the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt private Centinel, know Your <hi>Poſts,</hi> and be very <hi>expert,</hi> and <hi>well Diſciplin'd</hi> Soldiers; that You may underſtand the <hi>Words of Command,</hi> and gracefully <hi>manage the Exerciſe of Your Arms,</hi> Guns and Swords, that You may readily <hi>form your various Figures;</hi> and perform exactly the <hi>numerous Wheelings, Fa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ings, Doublings, Counter-Marches,</hi> &amp;c. which a Word of Command, or a <hi>ſignal</hi> may require of You. That You may know how to <hi>Encamp,</hi> &amp; <hi>Intrench,</hi> how to <hi>lay Seiges, and to raiſe them;</hi> that You may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Statagems of War,</hi> when to take <hi>Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of an Enemy,</hi> how to Fight them with their own Weapons; and this either <hi>in a Line of Battle,</hi> or <hi>in lighter Skirmiſhes and Engagements.</hi> Yea it is expected that Your Company be like that which is deſcribed, Cant. 3. 7, 8. <hi>Threeſcore valiant men are about it, of the valiant of Iſrael. They all hold ſwords, being expert in war: every man hath his ſword upon his thigh, becauſe of fear in the night.</hi>—</p>
            <p>Wherefore make uſe of all the means requiſite for this end; not only to get the Theory of the Art into Your Minds; but to be exact in the Practice &amp; Application of it. And here that advice, which was once given to a Spiritual Soldier, may be fitly applied to every one of You: <hi>Give thy ſelf to theſe things, that they profiting may appear to all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how can this be expected, unleſs You con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly attend Your Duty on the days of Your Muſter, and admit only ſuch into Your Company, that have both a <hi>Genius</hi> and a Deſire to be expert in the ſeveral parts of Military Diſcipline.</p>
            <p>And to further this Deſign yet more; when the <hi>Anniverſaries</hi> arrive for the <hi>Election of Your Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:003860_0035_100265AF627A89C0"/>
it is expedient that You make Choice of ſuch Perſons among You, that are <hi>remarkable</hi> for their Skill in Arms and Battles, and that will endeavour to diffuſe their Knowlege and Martial Spirit into the whole Company: and that will ſtand ready if there be an Alarm of War, to <hi>Gird on the Sword, and appear a Glory at Tour Head,</hi> to lead You forth and Conduct You, with Wiſdom, Valour &amp; Order, not only to defend Yourſelves and the Cities of Your GOD; but alſo to offend and vanquiſh Your daring Enemies.</p>
            <p>And having us'd the proper means, ſeek earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God for his Bleſſing on them. The LORD is a Man of War; expert in it, and ready to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate a Martial Skill and Spirit to thoſe that ſeek aright unto Him for it. Give to Him the Glory of your preſent Attainments; and ſeek for the abundant increaſe of your Military Skill, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and Conduct; eſpecially of the <hi>Graces and Vertues</hi> of the Divine Life, which will make you <hi>good Men, good Chriſtians,</hi> as well as good Soldiers.</p>
            <p>In Fine, Let the Glory of GOD, the Honour of the King, the Love of Your Country, and the Defence of Your Religion and Liberties, be the Springs of Your Actions, and the ſtrongeſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to induce You to anſwer the <hi>Character of Men of War, of Mighty, Valiant Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And with theſe Hopes &amp; Views, we the LORD's Miniſters, do this Day, wiſh <hi>You a Bleſſing</hi> out of the Houſe of the LORD.</p>
            <p>To Conclude. <hi>Let us all Spiritualize the Truths we have heard,</hi> and apply what has been ſaid for our Inſtruction and Encouragement in our <hi>Spiritual Warfare.</hi> We are all of us Members of the Church

Militant, and have numerous and potent Enemies to conflict with; not only Fleſh and Blood, not only the Men and Things of the World, but alſo Principalities and Powers, and Spiritual Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in High Places: Their Name is <hi>Legton</hi> for they are many.</p>
            <p>Now we are no ways a Match for them or equal to them; and if the LORD help us not, we ſhall one Day periſh by their Hands. To Him therefore let us all humbly repair: <hi>to JESUS who is a GOD manifeſt in Fleſh.</hi> He is the <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> the Captain of the LORD's Hoſts, and an eminent Man of War.</p>
            <p>Let us ſeek to Him for <hi>Divine Wiſdom and Skill,</hi> that we mayn't be Ignorant of the Devices, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagems and Depths of our Spiritual Enemies; nor of the Methods how to Oppoſe and Defeat them.</p>
            <p>And let us ſeek to Him, for <hi>Spiritual Courage and Conduct;</hi> that we may be able to ſtand an aſſault, to reſiſt the Devil, and to quench the fiery darts of the Wicked one.</p>
            <p>And in a Word, we muſt ſeek to Him to <hi>Cloath us</hi> with our <hi>Spiritual Armour; to teach us the uſe of it, and to make us Wiſe and Succeſsful in it.</hi> Let us be ſatisfied with nothing leſs than the <hi>intire De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat</hi> of the Enemies of our Souls.</p>
            <p>Wherefore, Let us look unto JESUS to direct and ſtrengthen us; and <hi>Obey the Words of His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand:</hi> ſo ſhall we be <hi>Victorious in the Day of Battle;</hi> and come off Conquerors, yea, more than Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, through Him who has Loved us, and Died for us; who has led Captivity Captive, and drawn Satan in Triumph at His Chariot Wheels.</p>

And when the <hi>Warfare is accompliſhed,</hi> and the <hi>Camp is rais'd,</hi> and we are <hi>diſcharg'd by Death,</hi> an open Entrance ſhall be miniſtred to us abundantly into the everlaſting Kingdom of our LORD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>Then we ſhall be clad in <hi>White Raiment,</hi> have Crowns put upon our Heads, and Palms in our Hands, and our Mouths fill'd with Songs of Joy and Triumph: Yea we ſhall joyn the <hi>Heavenly Hoſt and the Church Triumphant above,</hi> in their HAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LELUIA's and Anthems of Praiſe to GOD, and to the Lamb that ſitteth on the Throne for ever &amp; ever.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe with that Doxology, 1 Tim. 1. 17. <hi>Now unto the KING ETERNAL, IMMORTAL, INVISIBLE, the only WISE GOD, be HONOUR and GLORY, for ever and ever.</hi>
