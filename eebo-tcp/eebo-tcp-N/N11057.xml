         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

GEORGE. Endue him plenteouſly with heavenly gifts, and grant him in health and wealth long to live! Inſpire him with the true ſpirit of wiſdom and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment!

            <p>REMOVE far from his Royal Perſon all thoſe, who would ſeek to change his government into oppreſſion, and to gratify their own licentious deſires at the expence of the blood and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his ſubjects!</p>

with you in your preſent trying cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances could enable me to overcome. The occaſion is of the firſt importance: the ſubject in a great meaſure new to me—Throwing myſelf, therefore, upon your can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and indulgence, conſidering myſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the twofold character of a miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, and a FELLOW-CITIZEN of the ſame ſtate, and involved in the ſame public calamity with yourſelves; and looking up for counſel and direction to the ſource of all wiſdom, "WHO GIVETH LIBERALLY TO THOSE THAT ASK IT—I have made choice of a paſſage of ſcripture, which will give me an opportunity of addreſſing myſelf to you as FREEMEN, both in the ſpiritual and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſenſe of the word, and of ſuggeſting to you ſuch a mode of conduct, as will be moſt likely, under the bleſſing of Heaven, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to you the enjoyment of theſe two kinds of Liberty. STAND FAST, THEREFORE, IN THE LIBERTY, WHEREWITH CHRIST HATH MADE US FREE.</p>
            <p>THE inſpired Author of this excellent Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition was ſo ſenſible of the invaluable
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:014013_0009_0F928737B173C658"/>
bleſſings and comforts that reſulted from that free ſpirit, with which JESUS CHRIST through his Miniſtry, had eſtabliſhed his Galatian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, that he was jealous of the leaſt attempt to deſtroy or even obſtruct in them its life-giving operation. He could not brook the narrow ſpirit of thoſe Judaizing Chriſtians, who, from the moſt ſelfiſh and illiberal motives, ſought to force a yoke upon the necks of their Gentile Brethren, which neither they themſelves nor their Fathers had been able to bear. Theſe Gentiles too he ſeverely reproves for not maintaining their ground, and aſſerting their Goſpel Freedom againſt the inſidious devices of their Brethren, who only wanted to bring them into ſervitude, "THAT THEY MIGHT GLORY IN THEIR FLESH."—"O FOOLISH GA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LATIANS! WHO HATH BEWITCHED YOU?" He aſcribes their blindneſs and infatuation to ſome diabolical charm, which had locked up the powers of their free-born ſpirits, and made them tamely ſubmit to ſlaviſh, carnal ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which the Goſpel of JESUS had entirely exploded and aboliſhed. He reminds them, by a ſpirited explication of a moſt ſtriking allegory, that they were not "CHILDREN OF
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:014013_0010_0F928739A658CD90"/>
THE BOND-WOMAN, BUT OF THE FREE;" that their obſervance of the ceremonial law was a tribute, which they were not bound to pay; or, if they ſhould be ſo weak as to ſubmit to it, that it could not emancipate them from the bondage of earth and hell; but that their real freedom, their full and compleat juſtification, their happineſs temporal and eternal were only to be acquired by a vigorous exertion of thoſe ſpiritual powers within themſelves, which, through the riches of GOD'S free grace in CHRIST JESUS, had been communicated to their ſouls. He concludes this part of his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs with the truly noble and apoſtolical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of my text: STAND FAST, THEREFORE, IN THE LIBERTY, WHEREWITH CHRIST HATH MADE US FREE.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus briefly opened the occaſion and meaning of the words, I ſhall proceed to ſhew, in the firſt place, what we are to underſtand by that SPIRITUAL LIBERTY, "WHEREWITH CHRIST HATH MADE US FREE," and what kind of conduct that muſt be, which is here expreſſed by the words "STAND FAST."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:014013_0011_0F928739EC7A2390"/>
I. HOWEVER ſevere, my dear Brethren, the loſs of our temporal Liberties may be, there is certainly a Bondage far more ſevere than this, yea, far more cruel, than that of ISRAEL under their EGYPTIAN Taſk-maſters. A Bondage, not only to men, but to the fallen ſpirits of darkneſs, ſeeking to exerciſe over us a joint power and dominion with our own irregular and corrupt paſſions. A Bondage univerſal, from which no Son of Adam hath ever been exempt; a tyranny, whoſe baleful influences have been felt from the fall of man down to this very day. It has ſeized not only upon the body, but upon the ſoul. It has erected its throne in the heart, and from thence impoſes its arbitrary decrees. It is confined to no age or ſex, no ſtate or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of human life. High and low, learned and unlearned, the ſavage and the ſage, are alike the victims of this deſpotic power, alike ſlaves by nature under this bondage of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</p>
            <p>IT is perpetually manifeſting itſelf under a variety of forms, according to our prevailing deſires and purſuits. It follows us into the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014013_0012_0F92873C4DA0EC10"/>
Sanctuary of God. It ſteals into our private devotions. It gives a phariſaical tincture to our beſt good works. It reigns as a maſter and abſolute Sovereign in the wicked and unregenerate. Yea, it frequently enters the moſt ſpiritual and regenerate hearts in hoſtile form, and ſeeks to ſhake their confidence in the goodneſs of their true and rightful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and their humble hope of deliverance through the redeeming power of his ever-bleſſed Son.</p>
            <p>NOW, who would not wiſh to be delivered from ſuch a bondage as this? And yet, my brethren, ſuch a wiſh cannot be formed, 'till, by divine grace, the free-born powers of the ſoul are brought to be ſenſible of their bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and to groan beneath the weight of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. "THE WHOLE (or they that think themſelves whole) NEED NOT A PHY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SICIAN, BUT THEY THAT ARE SICK." The madman hugs his chains, as if they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of royalty. Inſenſible of his calamity, he cannot even wiſh for relief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014013_0013_0F92873D9A9217F0"/>
BUT no ſooner does the child of grace, the offspring of Heaven come to feel the bondage of the infernal uſurper; no ſooner does he find himſelf harraſſed and oppreſſed by the obedience which he exacts to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous laws; no ſooner is he convinced, that ſuch an obedience muſt terminate in ever-laſting ſlavery and wretchedneſs, than he awakens from his ſleep of ſecurity, and turns to and avails himſelf of that light, and ſtrength, and ſpiritual courage and conſtancy, which his Redeemer is ever at hand to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and without which he feels himſelf abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely unequal to the conflict, and incapable of extricating himſelf from the ignoble ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>FROM hence then it appears, that the LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY, WITH WHICH CHRIST HATH MADE US FREE, is nothing leſs than ſuch a releaſe from the arbitrary power of ſin, ſuch an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of the ſoul by the efficacy of divine grace, and ſuch a total ſurrender of the will and affections, to the influence and guidance of the divine Spirit, ("FOR WE ARE MADE A WILLING PEOPLE IN THE DAY OF GOD'S
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014013_0014_0F92873DCEB749C8"/>
POWER") as will enable us to live in the habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual chearful practice of every grace and virtue here, and qualify us for the free, full and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted enjoyment of heavenly life and Liberty hereafter.</p>
            <p>THESE glorious privileges being once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, the ſinner being once juſtified, and adopted into the family of God, and having received the ſeal of his heavenly citizenſhip, the conduct recommended to him in my text as the moſt effectual for the preſervation of theſe privileges, is here expreſſed by the words "STAND FAST:" that is to ſay:</p>
            <p>"MAINTAIN, firm and unſhaken, the ground which CHRIST hath given you. Be ever vigilant and prepared againſt the open or inſidious attacks of your adverſary."</p>
            <p>HE is not commanded to march upon the Devil's ground, to ſeek out the temper or the temptation, in order to make a trial of his ſtrength, or merely that he may have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of a victory: But only to "STAND FAST," to act upon the defenſive, and, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all points with a celeſtial panoply, to be ready to reſiſt and repel the moſt daring
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014013_0015_0F92873E76EFF318"/>
attempts of his perfidious foe: As well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that if he ſuffers himſelf to be taken cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, ſlavery and woe muſt be his everlaſting portion; but, if he comes off conqueror from the conflict, that the life, liberty and joys of Heaven will be his everlaſting reward.</p>
            <p>THUS far have I travelled in a well known path, and ſpoken a language familiar to moſt of you, and which you have long been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to hear from this Pulpit.</p>
            <p>II. I AM now to ſtrike into another path, which, though it may not always terminate in ſuch glorious ſcenes of never-ending felicity as the former, yet, if ſtedfaſtly purſued, will conduct the ſons of men to an happineſs, of an inferior kind indeed, but highly neceſſary to their preſent temporary ſtate of exiſtence in this world.</p>
            <p>IF SPIRITUAL LIBERTY calls upon its pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Votaries to extend their views far forward to a glorious HEREAFTER, CIVIL LIBERTY muſt at leaſt be allowed to ſecure, in a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable degree, our well-being HERE. And I believe it will be no difficult matter to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014013_0016_0F92873F347D31E0"/>
prove, that the latter is as much the gift of GOD in CHRIST JESUS as the former, and conſequently, that we are bound to ſtand faſt in our CIVIL as well as our SPIRITUAL FREEDOM.</p>
            <p>FROM what hath been ſaid under my firſt head of diſcourſe, I think it muſt appear, that LIBERTY, traced to her true ſource, is of heavenly extraction, that divine Virtue is her illuſtrious parent, that from eternity to eternity they have been and muſt be inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable companions, and that the hearts of all intelligent beings are the living temples, in which they ought to be jointly worſhipped.</p>
            <p>We have the authority of divine Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to aſſert, that this globe of earth was once the favoured ſpot, on which ſhe was ſent to reſide, and that the firſt man felt and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her divine influence within and around him. But the ſame Revelation tells us, what our own experience cannot but confirm, that when man loſt his virtue, he loſt his Liberty too; and from that fatal period, became ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the bondage of corruption, the ſlave
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:014013_0017_0F92874127E608F8"/>
of irregular paſſions, at war with himſelf and his own ſpecies, an alien from his native country, a ſorrowful ſtranger and a weary pilgrim in this world of woe.</p>
            <p>IT was not only to put him into a capacity of regaining his forfeited heavenly bliſs, but to mitigate, likewiſe, the ſorrows of his earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſojourn, that the EVERLASTING JESUS, in and by whom GOD originally created man, vouchſafed to communicate to him, when fallen, a ray of hope, a ſpark of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly light, wiſdom, power and goodneſs, by which, through the effectual workings of his grace, he might, in future time, inſpire him and his hapleſs poſterity with ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as would lead them to know, contend for and enjoy Liberty in its largeſt, nobleſt extent.</p>
            <p>WHATE'ER of order, truth, equity and good government is to be found among the ſons of men, they are ſolely indebted for to this EVERLASTING COUNSELLOR, this PRINCE OF PEACE. By nature ſurrounded with innumerable wants, which his own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle unaſſiſted hand could by no means ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014013_0018_0F9287416D79B558"/>
expoſed to innumerable dangers, which his utmoſt ſtrength and ſharpeſt foreſight could not poſſibly ward off, it muſt ſurely have been this WISDOM OF THE FATHER, that firſt taught man, by SOCIAL COMPACT, to ſecure to himſelf the poſſeſſion of thoſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries and comforts, which are ſo dear and valuable to his natural life. And though no particular mode of government is pointed out to us in his holy goſpel, yet the benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit of that goſpel is directly oppoſed to every other form, than ſuch as has the COM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MON GOOD of mankind for its end and aim.</p>
            <p>NOW this COMMON GOOD is matter of COMMON FEELING. And hence it is, that our beſt writers, moral and political, as well Clergy as Laity, have aſſerted, that true go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment can have no other foundation than COMMON CONSENT. 'Tis the power, the wiſdom, the majeſty of the people committed to ONE, to a FEW, or to MANY—yea, in ſome hitherto favoured ſtates, the ONE, the FEW, and the MANY, have been entruſted together, that they might mutually controul and be controuled by each other.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:014013_0019_0F92874255333730"/>
INASMUCH, therefore, as this ſolemn De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legation was intended for the good of the whole; inaſmuch as all Rulers are in fact the Servants of the Public, and appointed for no other purpoſe than to be "A TERROR TO EVIL-DOERS, AND A PRAISE TO THEM THAT DO WELL; whenever this divine or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is inverted, whenever theſe Rulers abuſe their ſacred truſt, by unrighteous attempts to injure, oppreſs, and enſlave thoſe very perſons, from whom alone, under GOD, their power is derived—does not humanity, does not reaſon, does not ſcripture call upon the Man, the Citizen, the Chriſtian of ſuch a community to "STAND FAST IN THAT LIBERTY WHEREWITH CHRIST (in their very birth, as well as by ſucceeding appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his Providence) HATH MADE THEM FREE?"</p>
            <p>THE Apoſtle enjoins us to "SUBMIT TO EVERY ORDINANCE OF MAN FOR THE LORD'S SAKE." But ſurely a ſubmiſſion to the unrighteous ordinances of unrighteous men, cannot be "FOR THE LORD'S SAKE: For "HE LOVETH RIGHTEOUSNESS, AND
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014013_0020_0F92874371C9D1B0"/>
HIS COUNTENANCE BEHOLDS THE THINGS THAT ARE JUST."</p>
            <p>POSSESSED, therefore, of theſe principles—Principles, upon which the preſent conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of BRITAIN was happily ſettled at one of her moſt glorious and memorable aeras, and upon which alone it can ſtill be ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—Poſſeſſed of theſe principles. I truſt it will be no difficult matter to ſatisfy your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences with reſpect to the righteouſneſs of the cauſe, in which you are now engaged.</p>
            <p>THE ſtruggle, 'tis true, is an unnatural one. The hard neceſſity of ſtanding upon our defence againſt our brethren, children of the ſame family, educated in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, the ſame religion with ourſelves, bound together by a long reciprocation of endearing offices, by a long participation of common bleſſings, and of common dangers and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, mutually protecting and protected by each other.—The hard neceſſity, I ſay, of defending ourſelves, our juſt and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed rights againſt ſuch unnatural adverſaries, (though ſadly to be lamented, as one of the heavieſt judgments with which Heaven could
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:014013_0021_0F928743B5E5F170"/>
viſit us for our iniquities) ought not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to make us ſurrender at diſcretion, or diſcourage us from "STANDING FAST IN THAT LIBERTY, WHEREWITH CHRIST (as the great providential governor of the world) HATH MADE US FREE."</p>
            <p>WE venerate the Parent Land from whence our progenitors came. We wiſh to look up to her as the GUARDIAN, not the INVADER of her children's rights. We glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the name of children. But then we wiſh to be treated as children—And chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren too, that have arrived at years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</p>
            <p>BUT, if we are to judge from the late ungenerous and ill-digeſted plans of policy, which have been adopted by thoſe whom ſhe hath entruſted with the powers of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, we cannot but think, that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be jealous of our riſing glory, and, from an ill-grounded apprehenſion of our aiming at independency, were deſirous of checking our growth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:014013_0022_0F928744715D11D8"/>
YET why this unſeaſonable and unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous jealouſy?—We wiſh not to interfere with that commercial ſyſtem, which they have hitherto purſued. We have not even ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our expectations beyond the line, which they themſelves had drawn. We wiſh not to poſſeſs the golden groves of Aſia, to ſparkle in the public eye with jewels torn from the brows of weeping Nabobs, or to riot on the ſpoils of plundered provinces.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>HERE perhaps it may be objected, that the Americans do with a very ill grace cenſure their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh brethren, either for their iniquitous conqueſts in Aſia, or for the luxuries thereby introduced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, whilſt they themſelves are rioting upon the labour of thouſands of their own ſpecies, torn away from their native retreats, from their deareſt relations and friends, and doomed to a moſt abject and perpetual ſlavery—</p>
                  <p>IN anſwer to this objection it may be aſked—Where did this infamous commerce originate? And where is it ſtill carried on with all the eagerneſs which avarice can inſpire? Where, but in England?—By what means can it be aboliſhed? Surely by that power alone, which America acknowledges the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtate may juſtly exerciſe over all her dominions, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the power of regulating their trade?—</p>
                  <p>Is it not well known, that the legiſlatures of ſome of the colonies have done what they could to put a ſtop to the importation of African ſlaves, by loading it with the heavieſt duties? And that others have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted the total abolition of it, by acts of aſſembly, which their Governor refuſed to paſs, have then pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned the parent ſtate for new inſtructions to their Governors on this head, and after all, have failed of ſucceſs?</p>
                  <p>IT is however, devoutly to be wiſhed, that when a happy reconciliation once takes place, this poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous branch may entirely be ſhut out, before our great commercial ſtream becomes ſo infected by the contagion, as to endanger the health and ſecurity of the whole empire.</p>
               </note> We rather
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:014013_0023_0F9287452B8B9928"/>
tremble for the parent ſtate, and would fain keep off from our own borders, thoſe lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uries, which may perhaps already have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired her conſtitutional vigour. We only wiſh, that what we have we may be able to call OUR OWN; that thoſe fruits of honeſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, which our anceſtors had acquired or thoſe which have been, or may be added to them by the ſweat of our own brows ſhould not be wreſted from us by the hand of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, but left to our own free diſpoſal; ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied as we are in our conſciences, that when
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:014013_0024_0F928745EB878A18"/>
CONSTITUTIONALLY called upon, we ſhall not give "GRUDGINGLY OR OF NECESSITY", but chearfully and liberally.</p>
            <p>And as to any pretenſions to, or even de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of independency, have we not openly diſavowed them in all our petitions, repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and remonſtrances? Have we not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly and ſolemnly profeſſed an inviolable loyalty to the perſon, power and dignity of our SOVEREIGN, and unanimouſly declared, that it is not with HIM we contend, but with an envious Cloud of FALSE WITNESSES, that ſurround his throne, and intercept the ſunſhine of his favour from our oppreſſed Land?</p>
            <p>IF, notwithſtanding all this, BRITAIN or rather ſome degenerate ſons of BRITAIN, and enemies to our common Liberty, ſtill perſiſt in embracing a DELUSION, and believing a LIE—if the ſword is ſtill unſheathed againſt us, and SUBMIT OR PERISH is the ſanguinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree—why then—I CANNOT cloſe the ſentence—Indulge a Miniſter of JESUS!—My ſoul ſhrinks back with horror from the tragic ſcene of fraternal ſlaughter—and the free ſpirit of the citizen
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:014013_0025_0F928748EE3E16C8"/>
is arreſted by the tenderneſs of Goſpel love.—GRACIOUS GOD! ſtop the precious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of Britiſh and American blood—too precious to be ſpared in any other cauſe than the joint intereſt of both againſt a common foe!—</p>
            <p>PAINED, as I am at this melancholy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, I mean not, however, to decline ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing you in your military capacity, and ſuggeſting ſuch a conduct for the preſervation of your temporal rights, as by the bleſſing of Heaven, will be moſt likely to enſure you ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>"STAND FAST" then.</p>
            <p>I. "STAND FAST" by a ſtrong FAITH and dependence upon JESUS CHRIST, the great Captain of your Salvation. Enliſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Banner of his Croſs. And let this motto be written upon your hearts, IN HOC SIGNO VINCES, "UNDER THIS STANDARD THOU SHALT OVERCOME."</p>
            <p>II. "STAND FAST" by a virtuous and unſhaken UNANIMITY. Of ſuch an unanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you have a moſt ſtriking example now
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:014013_0026_0F92874AE055FC10"/>
before your eyes—three millions of people, or a vaſt majority of them, bound by no other ties than thoſe of honour and public virtue, voluntarily ſubmitting to the wiſe Political Determinations of an Honourable Council of Delegates aſſembled by their own free and unbiaſſed choice. Avail yourſelves of this illuſtrious example. Be unanimous in your particular department. And as one refrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory ſpirit may defeat the beſt-deviſed plan of operations, and throw your whole Corps into confuſion, ſee that this unanimity be productive of a juſt and becoming SUBORDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATION.</p>
            <p>REMEMBER, the Gentlemen who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you are your Neighbours, Friends and Fellow-Citizens, who have their ALL at ſtake as well as you. Their authority has not been impoſed upon you. They were inveſted with it by yourſelves. 'Tis ſurely your part then to ſupport them in the juſt execution of it; not doubting, but that on their part they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conſider, that they are not called to lord it over mercenaries, but affectionately to command Freemen and Fellow-Sufferers.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:014013_0027_0F92874C72D81530"/>
Accuſtom yourſelves, therefore, to diſcipline now; or elſe, when the day of trial comes, (which Heaven avert!) you will too late la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your unhappy neglect.</p>
            <p>III. STAND FAST" by an undaunted COURAGE and MAGNANIMITY. And here give me leave to remind you, that there is a kind of courage, which ſeems to be merely animal or conſtitutional.—This may ſtand a Soldier in good ſtead perhaps for a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amid the heat and fury of a battle when his blood and ſpirits are ſet on fire by the warlike ſound of drums and trumpets. But I would have YOU poſſeſſed of more than this, even a courage that will prove you to be good Chriſtians, as well as good Soldiers, a firm invincible fortitude of ſoul, founded upon religion, and the glorious hope of a better world; a courage, that will enable you not only to withſtand an armed phalanx, to pierce a ſquadron, or force an entrenchment, when the cauſe of virtue and your country calls you to ſuch a ſervice, but will ſupport you, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, againſt the principalities and powers of
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:014013_0028_0F92874CC3F62900"/>
darkneſs, will ſtand by you under the aſſaults of pain and ſickneſs, and give you firmneſs and conſolation amid all the horrors of a death-bed ſcene.</p>
            <p>SUCH a courage as this too will always be tempered with prudence, humanity, and greatneſs of ſoul. It will never degenerate into Savage cruelty and barbarity. If to ſpread undiſtinguiſhing ruin and devaſtation through a country; if with more than Gothic rage, to break into the ſweet retreats of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic felicity and drive the aged and the helpleſs from their once quiet habitations—O my GOD! if this be heroiſm, if this be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary virtue—ſuffer not our people to learn the deſtructive art. Let them rather continue to be injured and oppreſſed themſelves, than taught thus wantonly to injure and oppreſs others. This caution, however, is unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to you. Permit me, then only to obſerve, that in our preſent circumſtances, we contend not for Victory, but for Liberty and peace.</p>
            <p>NOR let me diſmiſs this head of advice without reminding you of the glorious ſtand
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014013_0029_0F92874D6FCB6D88"/>
that hath been already made for us by our northern Brethren, and calling upon you to thank Heaven for his great and gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition. Surely "the Lord of Hoſts was with them"—ſurely "the God of Jacob was their refuge."—Drop a pious tear to the memory of the illuſtrious ſlain—and let them yet live in the annals of American Freedom.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, "STAND FAST" by a ſteady CONSTANCY and PERSEVERANCE. Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties unlooked for may yet ariſe, and trials preſent themſelves ſufficient to ſhake the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt firmneſs of human fortitude. Be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, therefore, for the worſt. Suffer not your ſpirits to evaporate by too violent an ebullition now. Be not too eager to bring matters to an extremity; leſt you ſhould be wearied out by a continued exertion, and your conſtancy ſhould fail you at the moſt important criſis. Coolly and deliberately wait for thoſe events which are in the hands of Providence, and depend upon him alone for ſtrength and expedients ſuited to your neceſſities.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:014013_0030_0F92874E34216DB0"/>
IN a word, my brethren—though the worſt ſhould come—though we ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of all the conveniencies and elegancies of life—though we ſhould be cut off from all our uſual ſources of commerce, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, as many of our poor brethren have already been, to abandon our preſent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable habitations—let us, nevertheleſs, "STAND FAST" as the Guardians of LI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BERTY—And though we ſhould not be able to entertain the Heaven-born Maid, with ſuch affluence and ſplendor, as we have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done, let us ſtill keep cloſe to her ſide, as our inſeparable companion, preſerve her from the violence of her adverſaries, and, if at laſt neceſſary, be content to retire with her to thoſe peaceful, though homely retreats of rural life, in which ſhe was firſt entertained by our venerable Anceſtors—determined to contend to the very laſt for ſuch an illuſtrious Prize, and never to part with her, but for the more ſure and compleat enjoyment of her bleſſings in a World of Glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:014013_0031_0F92874EFB5529C8"/>
"NOW, THEREFORE, BE STRONG, O ZERUBBABEL, AND BE STRONG, O JOSHUA, THE SON OF JOSEDECH THE HIGH-PRIEST, AND BE STRONG, O YE Counſellors, Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and PEOPLE OF THE LAND; FOR I AM WITH YOU, SAITH THE LORD OF HOSTS.—LOOK UNTO ME, AND BE SAVED, ALL YE ENDS OF THE EARTH! Even ſo, grant, thou great and glorious GOD, that to thee only we may look, and from thee experience that deliverance, which we aſk, not for any merits of our own, but for the ſake and through the merits of the dear Son of thy love CHRIST JESUS our Lord! To whom, with thee, O FATHER, and thee O BLESSED SPIRIT! Three per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in one eternal GOD, be aſcribed all honour, praiſe, and dominion now, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth and forever!</p>
