            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE right education of children is a matter of great importance, and has been viewed in this light by wiſe men in all generations. No creatures come into the world in a more needy and helpleſs condition, as to the body, than mankind; being naked and feeble, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire much care and nurſing before they are able to help themſelves: and they equally ſtand in need of aſſiſtance as to their minds, which are void of knowledge and wiſdom, and (which renders their condition more piteous) naturally inclined to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibe error rather than truth, and to prefer the paths of vanity, folly and ſin to the ways of virtue, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and religion. It is written, Job xi. 12. "Man is born like the wild aſs's colt," which is a lively ſimilitude of ignorant and depraved mankind, for
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:045482_0004_101FFED0638379F8"/>
an aſs is a ſilly, ignorant creature, even to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb: and a wild aſs has ſomething in him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he more fully reſembles fallen man; this crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is noted in ſcripture for wantonneſs, Jer. ii. 23. and alſo for ſtubbornneſs and an ungovernable diſpoſition. Job xxxix. 5. "Who hath ſent out the wild aſs free, or who hath looſed the bands of the wild aſs? whoſe houſe I have made the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, and the barren land his dwellings. He ſcorneth the multitude of the city, neither regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he the crying of the driver." <q>The horſe muſt travel and the ox draw the plough; the one has a bit put into his mouth, and the other is under a yoke: but a wild aſs is a ſtranger to diſcipline, and likes not to hear of any maſter but himſelf, or to be a ſervant to any but his own will. Such is the nature of man, he loves to be free, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be diſſolute. He cannot endure to be ſubdued to order; he would know no law but his own luſt, nor rule but his own deſire. He is ſo much for ſinful liberty, he cares not for true liberty. The liberty he ſeeks makes him a bond-ſlave to corruption.</q> Thus man is born like the wild aſs's colt, ignorant, wanton and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious. And as he is thus born, ſo, without right education, he is in danger of growing up wild, rude, and deſtitute of profitable knowledge and true wiſdom. As uncultivated land brings forth briars and thorns, ſo, in untutored and uninſtructed minds, odious and hurtful luſts grow up, nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſtrong, which, in their operation, render the ſubjects themſelves unhappy, and often diſquiet all around them, or with whom they are concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:045482_0005_101FFED2C8FA7640"/>
Thoſe who have had no good education are liable to become the ſlaves of every lawleſs appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite and paſſion, to be led aſtray by every tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to evil, to take wrong methods to procure the ſupports of the preſent life, and to walk in the broad road which leads to ruin hereafter. And hence appears the importance of right education, with reſpect to the intereſt of children themſelves, that they may be preſerved from ſuch evils as have been mentioned, and be led in the way which leads to virtue and wiſdom, peace and comfort here, and to glory, honour and immortality here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. It is of importance alſo with reſpect to civil ſociety, that this may be ſupported, and the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits and bleſſings which reſult from thence enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is of importance with reſpect to the church of Chriſt, that this may be preſerved on earth, and true religion maintained in the world. In a word, the intereſt not only of the preſent, but of future generations, is deeply concerned in this matter. It has therefore been juſtly accounted a wiſe act in parents and others to pay a particular attention hereunto, and to ſpare no ſuitable pains and coſt in having the riſing generation well inſtructed.</p>
            <p>To this end we have the injunction in the text, from a wiſe king, under the influence of divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, to "train up a child in the way he ſhould go;" which implies, that there is a wrong way, in which children ought not to go, and for prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of which, right education is neceſſary, and alſo a right way, in which they ought to walk, and to which a good education muſt point and introduce them; and for our encouragement to the practice

the paths of vanity and folly. They have not only the light of conſcience, but the light of education, to conflict with; and many a ſtruggle they muſt have in their own minds, and many upbraidings of conſcience, before they can eaſily go contrary to all the wiſe inſtructions that have been given them, and addict themſelves to vicious courſes. (3.) If they do depart for awhile, there is great hope that they will ſee their error, and be reclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Even the great and wiſe King Solomon, the author of this book of Proverbs, turned aſide, for a time, from the right way, but was brought to true repentance and reformation, as is evident from the book of Eccleſiaſtes, which, it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, he wrote in his old age, and which contains a publick teſtimony of his repentance and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all thoſe ſinful courſes to which he had been addicted. So that when it is ſaid in the text, that thoſe who are trained up in the way wherein they ſhould go, will not depart from it in after years, we may underſtand, that they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ill not eaſily and ordinarily depart from it, or if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ey do ſo for a time, yet that there is great reaſon to hope they will be happily recovered. There are no general rules without exceptions; and though upon ſome, all care and pains prove but loſt labour, yet, as to many others, it is otherwiſe. And if the labour is loſt as to the youth themſelves, yet thoſe, to whoſe care and inſtruction they have been committed, will have the ſatisfaction of having diſcharged their duty, though they have not attained the end they deſired.</p>

            <p>Good examples muſt accompany and follow good inſtructions, or the latter, ſo far as relates to moral conduct, are not likely to be very beneficial. Nak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed precepts, as to civil, moral or religious conduct, where there is no ſuitable example attending, are commonly heard with indifference, and but poorly obſerved. Examples carry ſtrong conviction to the mind, and make deep impreſſions on the heart; theſe, therefore, ſhould always accompany pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts, as a means to perſuade to a compliance, or enforce an obſervation. They, therefore, who are inſtructors of children, but careleſs whether they exhibit any good examples of moral or religious behaviour before them, ought not to wonder if they ſee the greateſt inattention and diſregard paid to the moſt ſolemn injunctions; while the inſtructor who practiſes agreeable to the rules he gives unto his ſcholars, will convince their judgments, win their affections, and perſuade them to imitation.</p>
            <p>A wiſe diſcipline or government muſt be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixed with inſtructions and examples. This is abſolutely neceſſary in families and ſchools, for maintaining good order, correcting the diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, reſtraining and overawing the viciouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, and encouraging the well diſpoſed. Where there is no rule or right government, diſorder, confuſion and every evil work will ſoon take place; the progreſs of learning is impeded, and no great good is to be expected.

to their capacity, age, and the particular parts of learning in which they are employed.</p>
            <p>Thus have I endeavoured to give ſome outlines of a good education of children, both at home and at ſchool. Let us now, by way of improvement, make ſome reflections on what has been offered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence we may ſee, that parents and others are well employed, when they are doing what is in their power, that their children, and others under their care, may be well inſtructed, that, if their lives are ſpared, they may fear the Lord, and be uſeful members of ſociety in thier generation; and if they are taken away while young, that they may be bleſſed hereafter. If any think the time and neceſſary expenſe beſtowed this way is to little or no purpoſe, it is becauſe they do not rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the benefits of a good education. Certainly it is to the commendation and praiſe of any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when they are careful to inſtitute and ſupport good ſchools, at ſuitable diſtances from each other, for the inſtruction and right education of children. In this reſpect, perhaps the endeavours of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this town are equal, according to their numbers and ability, to thoſe of any other people in theſe parts. We have a number of ſchool-houſes, in different parts of the town, which are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times all at once in uſe. We are now worſhipping in a new and elegant one, erected for the ſame no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble purpoſe. Our wiſhes, with reſpect to this edifice, and every other appropriated to this uſe, are, that they may always be ſupplied with ſuitable inſtructors, and that the moſt uſeful learning may
