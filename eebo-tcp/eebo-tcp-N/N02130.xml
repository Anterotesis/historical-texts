            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Now return the <hi>Book</hi> you were pleas'd, the laſt Week, to leave with me; and together with Thanks, I ſend you my <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,</hi> upon ſome Part of it, in compliance to your Deſires.

to the late Letter of <hi>Sober Remarks</hi> on the <hi>Modest Proof;</hi> which put the Diſpute wholly on a <hi>Scripture-Fost.</hi> For this Reaſon, although what my Author has offer'd from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> would admit of an eaſy Anſwer, yet I will take little or no notice of his Teſtimonies from Them; but ſhall limit my ſelf to the Arguments he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to draw out of the BIBLE; which a famous <hi>Epiſcopalian</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Chillingw.</note> well calls the <hi>Religion of Protestants.</hi> And here I don't intend to make Obſervations upon every little thing liable to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception in my Author: and as to Things Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, which I find have receiv'd a juſt Anſwer in the Letter of <hi>Sober Remarks,</hi> I deſign but briefly to touch upon 'em: unleſs perhaps ſome <hi>new</hi> Thoughts may occur to me, proper to be added; which the Writer of that Letter did not ſee fit to take any Notice of.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Barclay</hi>'s Diſcourſe, which is now to come under Examination, begins at the 78th Page of his Book. Where, in the firſt place, he lays down this, Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>"THAT the Government of</hi> CHRIST's <hi>Church was left by himſelf, and manag'd for the firſt Three Centuries by ſome Goſpel Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments, exerciſing Authority and Juriſdiction over others, who were <hi>Likewiſe</hi> Miniſters of the Word and Sacraments".</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HERE not to take notice of any Soleciſms in Grammar, or any thing elſe lyable to Exception, in the Propoſition it ſelf, I will come im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to conſider the Arguments he brings to ſupport this Aſſertion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002531_0004_0FDB5BC95B55A670"/>IN the firſt place, I find him harping on the old thread-bare Argument from the 12 and the 70. Though here he ſeems to yield to Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians the Diſpute about the Superiority of the 12 to the 70, during our Savior's Life-time. At leaſt, (he ſays to us, <hi>to take you in your own way;</hi> a Phraſe I ſhall have frequent occaſion to borrow from him) he will for once <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that they were <hi>equal.</hi> But then he adds, pag. 79. <q>If we can find a <hi>Second Superior Ordination</hi> given by our Savior to the <hi>Eleven,</hi> which the <hi>Seventy</hi> did not receive. I hope it will appear that the <hi>Eleven</hi> were of a <hi>higher Order,</hi> and had a greater Degree of Power in the Church than They.</q> Now to evidence this, he turns us to <hi>Job.</hi> 20.21. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, ſo ſend I you,</hi> &amp;c: which (he judges) <q>doth imply a <hi>new Commiſſion,</hi> veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Eleven Apoſtles with the Power of <hi>Ordination,</hi> or of ſending others; for (he argues) unleſs CHRIST gave 'em that Power, he did not ſend them <hi>as his Father ſent him.</hi>
               </q>
Here I might obſerve, There are other and better Interpretations of this Text; but being willing to take the Gentleman in his own way, I will for once ſuppoſe his Conſtruction to be the beſt and trueſt: yet of what Service it will be to him, in the preſent Argument, I cannot imagin. Surely 'tis a wild Concluſion he draws, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Then it is evident, that our Savior left his Church with a Set of Goſpel-Miniſters veſted with <hi>different</hi> degrees of Power and Authority.</q> For this Inference is grounded on a falſe Hypotheſis, <hi>viz.</hi> That CHRIST at his Aſcenſion left <hi>other</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters in Commiſſion beſides the <hi>Eleven;</hi> which is a point he has not ſaid one word to prove:
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002531_0005_0FDB5BCBA3DF9FD0"/>
Certainly this Gentleman muſt have a fine Talent in Controverſy; ſince he has taken ſo much pains to prove what no body denies, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Eleven were veſted with a power of Ordination; and then has taken for granted one of the main Things in Queſtion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Continuance of the Seventy in Office in the Church. All Anti-Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latiſts agree with him in aſſerting the former, but not the latter. We unanimouſly affirm the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreity</hi> of the Seventy. If then the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wou'd have (as he promis'd to do) taken us in our own way, He ſhou'd have ſuppos'd this; and this notwithſtanding, prov'd an <hi>Imparity</hi> of order among Goſpel-Miniſters. Now that He might well ſuppoſe (with us) the 70 to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, every one I believe will readily grant, who reads impartially what is ſaid on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the <hi>Sober Remarks</hi> (Edit. 2. <hi>Pag.</hi> 29. &amp;c.) So that I need ſay nothing on it here. But he ſilently ſlides over this, as if it were a point not diſputed, or were foreign to the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; when he knows it is a matter of Debate, and that not a little depends upon it. For, if the Commiſſion of the Seventy was but tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary, and not renew'd after CHRIST's Reſurrection, then He left only one Order of Goſpel-Miniſters, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Eleven;</hi> and thoſe veſted with equal Power of Ordination and Juriſdiction, by the new Commiſſion they receiv'd at His Aſcending.</p>
            <p>WE may ſafely therefore grant our Author, <q>That the <hi>Eleven Apostles</hi> receiv'd a Power by this laſt Commiſſion, which they had not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and which none of the <hi>Seventy</hi> did <hi>then</hi> receive: and yet it will not follow from hence, That our Savior left his Church with a Set of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002531_0006_0FDB5BCF4E224558"/>
Goſpel-Miniſters veſted with <hi>different</hi> degrees of Power and Authority.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER, to take this Gentleman in his own way, I will for once ſuppoſe the Commiſſion of the <hi>Seventy</hi> (recorded <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.) was not temporary, but ſtanding and perpetual: yet this will not certainly infer the Divine Appointment of two different Orders of Goſpel-Miniſters, in the <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches, with whom it is we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. For (as it is argu'd in the <hi>Sober Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,</hi> pag. 31, 32.) the Commiſſion of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty was confined to the <hi>Circumciſion;</hi> and we never read of its being extended by CHRIST, to the <hi>Uncircumciſion.</hi> It is of no Obligation then upon the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Suppoſing it did continue, &amp; was obligatory to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Chriſtians; yet the <hi>Gentile</hi> Churches are not at all concerned with it. Whether therefore that Commiſſion was temporary, or whether it was ſtanding, it is alike incapable of ſerving this Gentleman's Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>BUT now leaving the Commiſſions, He comes to argue from FACT, Pag. 80. Where He tells us, <q>The <hi>Apoſtles</hi> did <hi>(de facto)</hi> exerciſe <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> over all other <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters</hi> in their Time.</q>— This I will for once ſuppoſe to be true; for I'm willing ſtill to take the Gentleman in his own way: but yet I believe, It will not afford any Argument for Dioceſan Biſhops, if we conſider things impartially.</p>
            <p>HE tells us, The Apoſtles exerciſed Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the Reſt of the Goſpel-Miniſters, <hi>In making Laws.</hi> What then? Do's this argue, that there muſt be a ſtanding Order in the Church to make Laws, and preſcribe Rules to Miniſters? No, by no means. The Church was in its <hi>Infant-State</hi> then, and the Canon of <hi>Scripture</hi> not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002531_0007_0FDB5BD2589E5E40"/>
the Apoſtles were therefore extraordi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>narily inſpir'd, to reveal the Mind and Will of CHRIST, unto his People and Miniſters <note n="‖" place="bottom">See the <hi>Sober Remarks,</hi> pag. 33. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Edit. 2.</note>. But, as there is no need of any ſuch infallible Guides now, ſince the Canon of the New Teſtament is completed; So, that the Apoſtles, who were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely inſpir'd, and under an infallible Conduct, did preſcribe Rules and Laws to Churches and Paſtors, This certainly is no Warrant, to Men not ſo qualify'd, to preſume to do the ſame thing, 'Tis not a <hi>Legiſlative,</hi> but an <hi>Executive</hi> Power, that belongs to the ordinary Governors of the Church. They have Authority only to execute the Laws of CHRIST, contained in the Holy Scriptures. And I know of no Laws or Orders there, but what ordinary Paſtors have the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of, committed to them.</p>
            <p>Again, HE tells us, <q>The Apoſtles Authority over other Miniſters appears from their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to Miniſterial Offices:</hi> which work (he ſays) was always perform'd by <hi>Them.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>TO prove this, He obſerves to us, in the firſt place, That the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ordain'd the <hi>Deacons,</hi> Act. 6.</p>
            <p>I anſwer; Good Reaſon there was, that they ſhould do it. The Apoſtles were the only proper Perſons to perform that firſt Ordination; for it was an appointing a <hi>New Office</hi> in the Church, which none elſe had Power to do, and unto which (no doubt) they were directed by the Holy Ghoſt. If any then will infer from this Inſtance, that Biſhops only have Power to ordain Deacons; they may as colourably argue from it, That Biſhops have Power to inſtitute <hi>new</hi> Officers &amp; Miniſtries in the Church.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:002531_0008_0FDB5BD80A451AC8"/>AGAIN, The Gentleman obſerves to us; <q>That St. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ordain'd <hi>Elders</hi> in every City, (<hi>Church,</hi> it ſhould be.) <hi>Act.</hi> 14.23.</q> To which I'll reply, in the Words of Another "Good Reaſon why; Becauſe They were new Churches that had no Miniſters in them till conſtituted by the Apoſtles. Presbyters cou'd not ordain before they had a Being. Beſides by the way, it may be obſerv'd: "They ordain'd <hi>Presbyters;</hi> not Dioceſan Biſhops. 'Tis evident from this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> left the Churches under the Government of <hi>Presbyters,</hi> without <hi>Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Biſhops.</hi> How came the Apoſtles not to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain ſuch Biſhops in every Church! If they had been neceſſary, doubtleſs they wou'd have done it".</p>
            <p>BUT further, The Gentleman obſerves, <q>There is one Inſtance, from which this Apoſtolical Superiority appears plainly; for when <hi>Philip</hi> baptis'd the Converts in <hi>Samaria Act.</hi> 8.12. Yet they could receive no <hi>Impoſition of Hands</hi> from him: but the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſent St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi> to <hi>lay hands on them;</hi> that is, for Confirmation and <hi>Ordination.</hi>
               </q> To which I anſwer; His Argument is loſt, if he has miſtaken the <hi>Deſign</hi> of that Impoſition of Hands. And it ſeems he has done ſo. For it is highly probable, 'Twas only for <hi>conferring the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifts of the Holy Ghost;</hi> which was a Power and Honour peculiar to the <hi>Apoſtles.</hi> (See <hi>Act.</hi> 8.15, 18.) That this was the <hi>Primary</hi> End, at leaſt, we have the general Concurrence of the beſt Expoſitors. And if this was the End, it is what was not only out of <hi>Philip</hi>'s power, but out of Biſhop <hi>Timothy</hi>'s too; and had <hi>He</hi> been at <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria</hi> then, there would have been the ſame Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002531_0009_0FDB5BD916A58FC8"/>
to ſend down the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> thither.—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to take the Gentleman in his own way, I will for once ſuppoſe, that this Impoſition of Hands immediately and only refer'd to <hi>Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Ordination:</hi> yet I do not ſee how <hi>Philip</hi>'s not being capable of performing theſe works, can afford any Argument to his purpoſe: for, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, <hi>Philip</hi> at that time was but a <hi>Deacon;</hi> and a Deacon's being incapable, is no Argument that a <hi>Presbyter</hi> (an higher Officer) muſt be ſo too. To make his Reaſoning here any thing tolerable. He muſt allow <hi>Philip</hi> was a Presbyter: but then the miſchief is, This will be to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf; ſince he expreſly calls him a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, (<hi>pag.</hi> 93.) and it will unhappily overthrow his great Plea there, [from the Inſtance of <hi>Philip</hi>] for <hi>Preaching</hi> &amp; <hi>Baptiſing</hi> Deacons.</p>
            <p>IN the next place, The Gentleman obſerves. <q>It is <hi>Objected,</hi> That mere Presbyters ordain'd St. <hi>Timothy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> from 1 Tim. 4.14. <hi>The laying on of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> the Presbytery.</hi> But (ſays he) this Text does not at all prove that <hi>Presbyters</hi> (in <hi>our</hi> 
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the Word) ordain'd <hi>Timothy.</hi>
               </q>
I reply, We don't pretend it do's. For we know of no Miniſters in <hi>Scripture,</hi> that were Presbyters, in the modern (<hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) ſenſe of the Word. We deny any ſuch Officer in the Church, us a <hi>mere Presbyter,</hi> that is, a Miniſter of the Word, deſtitute of Epiſcopal Power over the Flock. The Elders, or Presbyters, we read of, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.1. were <hi>Biſhops.</hi> Such Biſhops we are For, and ſuch Elders; but we know of no Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Elders that do not rule over the Flock, or for Biſhops that rule over Elders. We are for Congregational Biſhops; and ſuch we conclude,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002531_0010_0FDB5BDAA9FE2328"/>
were the Presbyters that ordain'd <hi>Timothy.</hi>—But the Gentleman adds, <q>If mere Presbyters did lay hands on him, it was only in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with St. <hi>Paul:</hi> for he ſays expreſly, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.6.) that <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordain'd <hi>by the laying on of</hi> His <hi>Hands.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>NOW to this I reply.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE Impoſition of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Hands might be at a <hi>different Time,</hi> and upon ſome other Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>IT is moſt probable, <hi>Paul</hi>'s laying on of Hands was not for the ordination of <hi>Timothy</hi> to any Office, but only for conferring the extraordinary Gifts of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> upon him. This might be the whole Deſign, for ought that appears to the Contrary; and ſo <hi>Paul</hi> might have no hand at all in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination. But that might be done by ordinary <hi>Presbyters</hi> at ſome other Time; as <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who receiv'd his ſight by the laying on of the Hands of <hi>Ananias,</hi> &amp; was filled with the Holy Ghoſt, yet afterwards was ſeparated to his Miniſtry among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by the laying on of the Hands of <hi>certain Prophets and Teachers,</hi> or Presbyters, at <hi>Antioch.</hi> (Act. 13.1, 2, 3.)</p>
            <p>BUT I would again take the Gentleman in his own way, and therefore will for once ſuppoſe, That <hi>Paul</hi>'s laying on of Hands was for <hi>Timothy</hi>'s <hi>Ordination;</hi> yet it is poſſible it might not be in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> but at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Time, if what our Opponents plead for, was then practis'd, <hi>viz. Reordination.</hi> How knows this Gentleman but that <hi>Timothy</hi> might be ordain'd firſt a <hi>Presbyter</hi> by the <hi>Presbytery</hi> alone, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a <hi>Biſhop</hi> by <hi>Paul</hi> only. Some of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren I know ſeem to be of this Mind. Well
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002531_0011_0FDB5BDE234E9AD0"/>
for once ſuppoſe this was the Caſe; ſo much then at leaſt follows, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> have power to ordain Presbyters: and this is all we at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent demand. As for <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Biſhops, &amp; their <hi>Conſecration,</hi> we will contentedly leave our Opponents to enjoy their Opinion about 'em; if we may but enjoy ours without Diſturbance.</p>
            <p>BUT now to come cloſer to our Author,—</p>
            <p n="2">2. I will for once ſuppoſe, that <hi>Paul</hi>'s laying on of hands, and the <hi>Presbytery</hi>'s, were both at the <hi>ſame Time,</hi> and in <hi>Conjunction;</hi> yet I can't ſee how this Conceſſion will give him any Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. The Gentleman obſerves, <q>If <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> did lay on hands in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination, it was <hi>only</hi> in Conjunction with St. <hi>Paul, [yes
verily, and if St.</hi> Paul <hi>lay'd on hands, it was only in Conjunction with the</hi> Presbytery] And ſo is agreable to our Practice at this day, as may be ſeen in the Rubrick of the Office for ordaining Prieſts.</q>—But here I inquire; <hi>How</hi> is it agreable? Do <hi>Presbyters</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> joyn in laying on of Hands in the Conſecrating of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Timothy</hi> is ſuppos'd by Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians to be? No, I trow not. 'Tis only the <hi>Arch-Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops preſent,</hi> that joyn in this Act; as may be ſeen in the Rubrick of the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for the Conſecration of Biſhops. Either then it muſt be confeſſed, <hi>Timothy</hi> was not a <hi>Biſhop;</hi> and ſo one of the great Arguments for <hi>Prelacy</hi> will be drop't. Or at leaſt it muſt be ſuppos'd <hi>Timothy</hi> was not ordain'd Biſhop <hi>at that time,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> &amp; the <hi>Presbytery</hi> joyn'd together in impoſing hands on him: however he might be afterwards, by <hi>Paul</hi> alone; which I think will ſuperſede the common Pretences for <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Epiſcopacy, from the <hi>first</hi> Epiſtle to Him. Or elſe the Church of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:002531_0012_0FDB5BDF1DA704C8"/>
muſt confeſs, She <hi>Deviates</hi> from the primitive <hi>Pattern,</hi> in excluding <hi>Presbyters</hi> from joyning in the Ordination of her Biſhops: and ſo far She muſt appear not Primitive and Apoſtolical; and her <hi>Prelates</hi> muſt be own'd not <hi>regularly</hi> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated; becauſe their Ordinations are without the Concurrence of the <hi>Presbytery.</hi> — One of theſe three, I think, muſt neceſſarily be granted: and let the Gentleman chuſe which he likes beſt.</p>
            <p>BUT now, ſuppoſing there were no ſuch Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties ariſing on the Head of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Character, and allowing that <hi>Paul</hi>'s aſſociating with him the Presbytery in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination, was but like the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s taking the Hands of ſome <hi>Presbyters</hi> with his, (as is the practice of the Church of <hi>England</hi>) in the ordination of a <hi>Presbyter;</hi> what Advantage will our Opponents be able to make of ſuch a Conceſſion? I think, none at all. For it ſeems to me, nothing more can be hence collected, but that as the <hi>Apostles</hi> did not appropriate to themſelves the Power of Ordination, ſo neither doth the Church of <hi>England</hi> allow her <hi>Biſhops</hi> to arrogate to themſelves the ſole Power in this matter. The Practice of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as well as of the Apoſtles, ſeems to argue for an inherent Power of ordination in <hi>Presbyters;</hi> which is all we at preſent plead for. Impoſition of Hands is what our Opponents account a very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential Rite in Ordination. That they judge is put for the whole Miniſterial Work of Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in 1 Tim. 5.22. <hi>Lay Hands ſuddenly on no man:</hi> and hence they urge this place, in favour of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s ordaining Power. Now if Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Hands, when perform'd by <hi>Timothy,</hi> was an ordaining Act, and imported an ordaining Power inherent in him; why might it not have the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002531_0013_0FDB5BE36FEA53B0"/>
ſame Signification, when perform'd by the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery?</hi> And if Ordination was the End and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Paul</hi>'s laying on of Hands; why not alſo of the laying on of the Hands of the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> that joyn'd with him? To ſay, That the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters laid on hands only as <hi>Witneſſes,</hi> and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their <hi>Conſent,</hi> &amp; <hi>Approbation</hi> of the Apoſtle's Act, (as ſome pretend) is but a filly Evaſion. When was the Ceremony ever uſed for ſuch an End? And might not the <hi>Presbyters</hi> as well have expreſs'd their Concurrence, by ſaying AMEN to the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Prayer over <hi>Timothy,</hi> or in ſome other way; without joyning with the Apoſtle in <hi>Impoſition of Hands,</hi> which wou'd ſeem to beſpeak an ordaining Power in them, as well as in him, and ſo be likely to prove an Occaſion of Error <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Sin in future Times, by leading Presbyters to claim to themſelves the power of Ordination; their right whereunto they might with good Colour argue from this primitive Example! It can't be reaſonably ſuppos'd, that the Apoſtle (who was ſuch a <hi>wiſe Master-Builder,</hi> and was ſo ſollicitous that Miniſters <hi>might know how to behave themſelves in the Houſe of God</hi>) ſhou'd be ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen in the management of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination, as to lay a foundation for Miſtakes in a matter of ſuch Importance, as this of Ordination. We may well think the Apoſtle wou'd not have admitted the <hi>Presbytery</hi> to lay on hands with him, if they had not been veſted with a Right to ordain, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was like to prove ſuch a <hi>Snare</hi> to After-ages; as it manifeſtly has been, if <hi>Presbyterians</hi> are in the Wrong.</p>
            <p>WELL but for once we will ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Presbytery</hi> did not lay on hands <hi>as Ordainers,</hi> but the whole Efficacy of the Ordination was from
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002531_0014_0FDB5BE5F678DEB8"/>
the Impoſition of <hi>Paul</hi>s Hands; yet how will this tend to ſerve our Author's Cauſe? Will this infer, that <hi>Biſhops</hi> may aſſume to themſelves the whole Power, excluſively of the Presbyters joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them? No, not at all. I will make it out thus. <hi>Paul</hi> laid on hands, either in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, or extraordinary Capacity. Now if the whole Efficacy of the Ordination was from HIS Impoſing of Hands, It cou'd not be in his <hi>ordinary</hi> Capacity, that he ordain'd; becauſe an Apoſtle in his ordinary Character was but a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> (as I think is fully prov'd in the <hi>Sober Remarks,</hi> to which I muſt refer the Reader for ſatisfaction) and upon this view of them, there can be no ſolid Reaſons aſſign'd for ſo eſſential a <hi>Difference</hi> (in the Virtue and Meaning) between the Act of <hi>Paul,</hi> and the Act of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Ordination. Hence therefore it muſt be in his <hi>extraordinary</hi> Capacity, that <hi>Paul</hi> ordain'd; and if ſo, then I ask, what Warrant <hi>Paul</hi>'s having the ſole ordaining Power, excluſively of the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, will be to <hi>Biſhops,</hi> for confining the Power of Ordination wholly to themſelves? Are they Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors to the Apoſtles, in the <hi>extraordinary</hi> parts of their Character? Have our Biſhops the Gift of <hi>Infallibility?</hi> Have they the Power of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Spirits?</hi> Or can they confer the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> by the laying on of their Hands? Verily, ſhow us Biſhops ſo qualify'd, and we ſhall be tempted to leave the work of Ordination <hi>wholly</hi> to Them, wherever they come! But till we can ſee ſuch Biſhops (at leaſt till then) we muſt be allow'd to aſſert the <hi>Presbyters</hi> Claim to the Power of Ordination. <q>And indeed the moderate Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors of Epiſcopacy (as one obſerves) do ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowlege that the Presbyters lay on hands
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002531_0015_0FDB5BE7622D5808"/>
with the Biſhop) <hi>as Ordainers.</hi> So Dr. <hi>F<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lk,</hi> Dr. <hi>Forbes,</hi> the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Spalato,</hi> and others. Even Dr. <hi>Cave</hi> (whoſe Authority, with the true Sons of the Church, is become al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt indiſputable) ſays, That Impoſition of Hands was conſtantly us'd as the Rite of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring Ordination upon the Miniſters of CHRIST.</q>
            </p>
            <p>NOW therefore, if Presbyters lay on hands with the Biſhop, as <hi>Ordainers,</hi> either They have an equal Power, or not. If they have an <hi>equal</hi> Power, then in the Ordination of a Miniſter, there is as much to be attributed to the Presbyters lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of Hands, as to the Biſhops: and hence it will follow, that Ordinations perform'd by Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, without a Dioceſan Biſhop, are no more null and void, than ordinations perform'd by ſuch a Biſhop, without the concurrence of the Presbytery.— But if any ſhall ſay, <hi>Presbyters</hi> have <hi>not</hi> an equal ordaining Power, with the Biſhop; I then ask, How this appears? If their Power be unequal, it muſt ariſe, either from unequal <hi>Commiſſions,</hi> or from unequal <hi>Qualifications.</hi> It cannot be owing to any difference of intrinſick <hi>Qualifications</hi> and Gifts. For if we conſider the <hi>Nature</hi> of Ordination, we ſhall find that the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Gifts of <hi>Presbyters</hi> are proportionable to all the outward Acts of it. What is Ordination, but a ſolemn <hi>Dedication</hi> or <hi>Separation</hi> of a ſutable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to God for the Miniſtry, by Faſting &amp; Prayer, with laying on of Hands? Now what is there in all this, above the Capacity of a <hi>mere</hi> Presbyter? What does the Biſhop do more in his <hi>conferring the Miniſtry?</hi> Is it in any Moral Act, or in the Phyſical Contact only, that the Biſhop exerts more of an ordaining Power! Is there any ſecret Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002531_0016_0FDB5BEB5A98D298"/>
in the Touch of a <hi>Prelate</hi>'s Hand! If ſo, from whence ſhou'd it ſpring? From his Superior Gifts, or from his exce<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ing Sanctity? Which of 'em, I pray!—But I believe our Opponents will not ſo much ground the Diſtinction here. If then there be an Inequality of ordaining Power, in Biſhops and in Presbyters, it muſt ariſe from the Difference of their <hi>Commiſſions.</hi> But this cannot be; becauſe the Commiſſion for ordination is one, and no more. An ordaining Power is included in the Apoſtles Commiſſion, Mat. 28.19. <hi>Go teach all Nations, baptiſing them,</hi> &amp;c. Or, (if it will pleaſe our Author better in his own Text) Joh. 20.21. <hi>As my Father hath ſent me, even ſo ſend I you.</hi> And they that pretend to the power of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, muſt claim it by this Commiſſion, as Succeſſors to the Apoſtles in the ſtanding parts of the Goſpel-Miniſtry. Hence then, if Presbyters have any degree of ordaining Power, it is equal &amp; the ſame with the Biſhops, without any the leaſt Diſparity or Diſtinction. I think there cannot be a clearer Conſequence. If therefore my Lords the Biſhops will claim a ſuperior Power to Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters; They muſt either produce ſome <hi>new</hi> Commiſſion for it: or prove that Presbyters do not derive what ordaining Power they have, from the Commiſſion <hi>above-mentioned:</hi> or elſe that the miniſterial Powers given the Apoſtles in this Commiſſion, might be tranſmitted to their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors in <hi>unequal</hi> Degrees. One of theſe things they muſt do before we can become their Profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytes, and let them undertake which they pleaſe, I'm afraid they'll fail in the Attempt and Confuſion will cover 'em,— Thus I have ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider'd the Gentleman's <hi>firſt</hi> Anſwer to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002531_0017_0FDB5BED618F9D20"/>
our Plea for Ordination by <hi>Presbyters,</hi> from 1 Tim 4.14.</p>
            <p>HE adds another Evaſion. page 81. ſaying, <q>But indeed many eminent Divines are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is render'd <hi>Presbytery,</hi> ſignifies the <hi>Office,</hi> to which <hi>Timothy</hi> was ordain'd; not the <hi>Perſons</hi> who laid hands on him.</q> And becauſe he ſuppoſes <hi>that</hi> would be of greateſt weight with as, he produces the Teſtimony of <hi>Calvin,</hi> in favour of this Opinion.—Now I freely confeſs, I honour <hi>Calvin</hi> highly: His Teſtimony has no little weight with me: I think it is as good an Authority as any. But I never ſet up <hi>Calvin</hi> for an <hi>Oracle,</hi> nor counted him <hi>Infallible.</hi> That He was not ſo, appears, in that he ſaw fit afterwards to alter his Mind in the very Point we are upon. It is out of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s <hi>Institutions,</hi> (which He wrote when he was a <hi>young Man</hi>) that our Author has taken his Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony: but if he intended to deal ingenuouſly, he ſhou'd have conſulted <hi>Calvin's Commentaries</hi> on the firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> (which He wrote twenty Years afterwards, when he was more ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of judging, and had conſider'd the matter more maturely) and there He wou'd have found this great Man expreſſing a different Apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and giving it as <hi>his Judgment,</hi> 
               <q>That they who underſtand the word <hi>Presbytery</hi> in a <hi>col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective</hi> ſenſe, as meaning the <hi>College of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> are in the <hi>Right</hi>

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002531_0018_0FDB5BEEEB3FF9C8"/>
ſo forced, and ſcarce reconcilable with common ſenſe. What, the <hi>laying on of the HANDS of the Office of Presbyters!</hi> Very uncouth and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Language methinks! I always imagin'd that <hi>Hands</hi> were the Property of Perſons; and <hi>laying on of Hands,</hi> an action not applicable to Offices.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, becauſe I'm willing as much as poſſible to take our Author in his own way, (a way the leaſt liable to Cavils) I will for once ſuppoſe, it is only the <hi>Office</hi> of <hi>Presbyterate,</hi> that's here ſpoken of: Yet I doubt not, this Senſe will make the Text as little improvable to his purpoſe, &amp; as much ſerviceable to the Presbyterian Cauſe, as the other, altho' he cou'd not, or wou'd not ſee it. For from hence it will follow, that <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> are the ſame, and not two Orders. Here conſider, It wou'd be abſurd to ſuppoſe, when the Apoſtle was exhorting <hi>Timothy</hi> to a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diligent Diſcharge of his Office and Work at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> that He ſhou'd put him in mind <hi>only</hi> of his Ordination to the Office of a <hi>Presbyters;</hi> if he had been by any ſecond and ſuperior ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion advanced to the Office of a Dioceſan <hi>Biſhop.</hi> Hence then we muſt in Reaſon conclude, that at the writing of this <hi>first</hi> Epiſtle, <hi>Timothy</hi> was not a Dioceſan, but a <hi>Presbyter.</hi> And yet in this very Epiſtle (as our Author obſerves to us, pag. 83.) St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> That his deſign in leaving him at <hi>Epheſus</hi> was, <hi>That he might charge ſome that they preach no other Doctrine.</hi> And he gives Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections for his exerciſing ſpiritual <hi>Cenſures,</hi> and managing the buſineſs of <hi>Ordination.</hi> Now if <hi>Timothy,</hi> while yet a <hi>Presbyter,</hi> was impower'd to do theſe things, the Conſequence is unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, That the powers of <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

do belong to Presbyters: and ſo Biſhops and Presbyters muſt neceſſary be of the ſame Order.</p>
            <p>THUS it appears, The Gentleman is under a great miſtake, and triumphs too ſoon, when he draws up that boaſting Concluſion; <q>So that the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>TO this I reply, firſt, They could not be a College of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> that ordain'd <hi>Timothy;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (if I may bring an Argument <hi>ad <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>) Paul</hi> ſeems to ſpeak of the Ordination of <hi>Timothy,</hi> as if the whole Virtue and Efficacy of it lay in the Impoſition of <hi>his</hi> Hands.

               </q> Now then either the Gentleman has put a wrong ſenſe on this (laſt) Text, and ſo it can be of no force againſt the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi>

               </gap> he apply'd it before. Or elſe it muſt be of force againſt Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Notion, which be here mentions, That the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery</hi> in the former Text meant a number of <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> for it do's not ſeem conſiſtent with the Modeſty and Humility of <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo to expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as if He was the SOLE ordainer of <hi>Timothy,</hi> when the other <hi>Apoſtles</hi> joyning with him, had <hi>equally</hi> the Power of ordination.</p>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:002531_0020_0FDB5BF57437B8B8"/>BUT now ſhou'd we for once grant, that they were <hi>Apoſtles</hi> only, that laid on hands in <hi>Timothy</hi>'s ordination, I cannot ſee how our Author will be able to ſerve his Cauſe by it. For nothing can be more evident than that, whoever ordain'd <hi>Timothy,</hi> they did it as a <hi>Presbytery:</hi> They acted in the Quality of <hi>Presbyters.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </hi> only, it ſeems they acted only in their <hi>ordinary Capacity.</hi> And here the Diſpute returns, whether or no <hi>Presbyters</hi> do ſucceed the Apoſtles in their <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And I think this very Text we are upon, may ſerve to decide it in the <hi>Affirmative.</hi> For, 'tis granted by our Adverſarys, That they are true &amp; complete Succeſſors of the Apoſtles, who ſucceed them in the Power of <hi>Ordination:</hi> and now that <hi>Presbyters</hi> do ſucceed them in this Power, ſeems a plain Conſequence from the Apoſtles aſſuming no other than the Character of a <hi>Presbytery,</hi> in the ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Timothy:</hi> [ſuppoſing the ordainers were Apoſtles.] At leaſt there is ſo much Colour for this Concluſion, that if it had been ſaid, <hi>By the laying on of the Hands of the</hi> Epiſcopacy, <hi>or Conſisto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Biſhops,</hi> I doubt not our <hi>Opponents</hi> wou'd have preſently boaſted the Text was <hi>deciſive,</hi> and have made very harſh Reflections upon us, if we had preſum'd to queſtion it.—But I ſhall ſay no more here, ſeeing our Author ſeems not ford of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi>'s Notion, <q>becauſe he do's not take it to be very <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>obvious:</hi> and he do'sn't inſiſt upon it (he ſays) becauſe he has neither Leiſure nor Inclination for Diſpute.</q> A very fine excuſe truly, when he finds in the Diſpute he is like to be preſs'd with inſuperable Difficulties! And I ſhou'd have charitably thought

the Man had been ſincere, if he had not fill'd his Pages with ſo many <hi>Cavils</hi> already.</p>
            <p>WELL but however <hi>that</hi> Notion be, plain or not; one thing he thinks is very plain, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That there is neither <hi>Precept</hi> nor <hi>Example</hi> in holy Scripture for <hi>Presbyters, <hi>without a Superior,</hi>
                  </hi> to ordain a Presbyter. <hi>Pag.</hi> 82.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HERE, in anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. I deny this to be very plain and obvious: and rather think the contrary is ſo. To clear this we muſt note, that our Author confines the Power of Ordination to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> only, and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, which he ſuppoſes Dioceſan <hi>Biſhops</hi> to be. He told us, pag. 80, <q>We find it always per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by the <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> And then, pag. 90. He tells us, the Power which our Biſhops of Right exerciſe, is the ſame with which our Bleſſed Saviour veſted the Eleven Apoſtles.</q> Hence by the <hi>Superior,</hi> which our Author here talks of, as preſiding in all the ordinations men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in Scripture, muſt be underſtood an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> or a Dioceſan <hi>Biſhop.</hi> Now then if there can be found an Inſtance of <hi>Presbyters</hi> ordaining, without the Preſidency, either of an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> or ſuch a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> I hope the Gentleman will ſee his miſtake. And for ſuch an one, I refer him to <hi>Acts</hi> 13.— where he will find <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſeparated to their ſpecial Miniſtry among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> by the Hand of certain <hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> at <hi>Antioch,</hi> who were neither Apoſtles nor Dioceſans.—Upon which one thus argues; <q>Either this Ordination is a Precedent to us, or not. If not, how can we be ſure that thoſe of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> or any other be ſo? If it be a Precedent, then
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002531_0022_0FDB5BF899797C00"/>
                  <hi>Presbyters</hi> have power to ordain; and that <hi>without</hi> Superior Biſhops, or Apoſtles, to preſide.</q>— But it may be, our Author will demand a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept</hi> as well as Example, for Presbyterian ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Now for this let him conſult the ſame Place, and he will find, That the HOLY GHOST <hi>ſaid</hi> unto thoſe Presbyters, <hi>Separate me</hi> Barnabas <hi>and</hi> Saul, <hi>for the work whereunto I have called them.</hi> Here is an expreſs <hi>Commiſſion</hi> to thoſe Presbyters to ordain, and this is Warrant enough for others to do it. Here is an Example of Presbyters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining, by the Authority of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt:</hi> and ſuch an Example muſt have the Force of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. If any now object, That that Commiſſion to the Presbyters, was a ſpecial and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, (being receiv'd by immediate Inſpiration) and therefore not to be argu'd from: I anſwer, By the ſame Rule, we may ſay that (Biſhop) <hi>Timothy</hi>'s ordaining Power was extraordinary. For as this Gift was given him by <hi>Propheſie,</hi> at his ordination; So it was by the Inſpiration of the <hi>Holy Ghost,</hi> that <hi>Paul</hi> gave him that Direction, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.22. by which our Author ſays, He <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered</hi> Him to <hi>ordain others.</hi> (<hi>Pag.</hi> 83.) Either then our Opponents muſt give up their Argument for Epiſcopal Ordination, from the inſpired Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons given to (Biſhop) <hi>Timothy</hi> about the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of his ordaining Power. Or elſe they muſt allow our Plea for Presbyterian ordination, from the inſpired Commiſſion, or rather Direction, given to the <hi>Presbyters</hi> at <hi>Antioch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>I HAVE not ſo much as mention'd</hi> the Inſtances of <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> who I think were neither Apoſtles, nor Dioceſan Biſhops; and yet ordained Presbyters without a <hi>Superiour:</hi> becauſe their
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:002531_0023_0FDB5BFC8DB6F898"/>
Character is controverted, and <q>I wou'd urge nothing but what I take to be very plain and obvious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT now, —</p>
            <p n="2">2. SUPPOSING this Anſwer were not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluſive, and granting for once, That there is <hi>no Example,</hi> in <hi>Scripture</hi> times, of the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Presbyter, by Presbyters, <hi>without a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior:</hi> yet this will be no valid Objection againſt the practice of Presbyterian ordination now. We will for once ſuppoſe, That <hi>Presbyters</hi> in the Apoſtles time, never ordain'd but under the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency of ſome <hi>Apoſtle:</hi> yet this will not infer any neceſſity of a Superior Officer to preſide in <hi>future</hi> ordinations. 'Twas but ſitting that the Apoſtles ſhou'd have the Direction of ſuch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, wherever they came; and that ordinary Miniſters ſhou'd pay a mighty Deference to ſuch extraordinary Men as they. The ordinary Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters did in a manner continually need the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of ſome ſuch inſpired Men, till the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> was completed; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done, the uſe of thoſe extraordinary Directors was ſuperſeded, by the ſtanding Guide or Rule; a Rule <hi>given by Inſpiration of God, and profitable for Doctrine,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that the Man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, thorou<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ly farniſhed were all good works,</hi> (2 Tim. 3.16, 17.) The Reaſon of Things is altered, There are now no ſuch inſpired Men is the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles; not is there any ſuch need of them now, as there was at firſt.</p>
            <p>IN fine, The ſuppoſed Preſidency of the Apoſtles in the Ordinations in their time, can be no more an Objection againſt Ordination by <hi>Presbyters</hi> alone, than by <hi>Biſhops</hi> alone. For either there were no ſuch Men as Dioceſan Biſhops then;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002531_0024_0FDB5BFDE02D4630"/>
or admitting there were, the Apoſtles had a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority over them, and Biſhops cou'd no more ordain without an Apoſtle, than Presbyters cou'd. Let our Adverſaries produce either Scripture Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, or Scripture Precedent, for Dioceſan <hi>Biſhops</hi> ordaining <hi>without a Superior:</hi> or tell us how the Preſidency of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> can make for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> in the ordinations of Miniſters: or ſhow us any Divine <hi>Prohibition</hi> of <hi>Presbyters</hi> ordaining <hi>without</hi> a Superior. Let 'em do any one of theſe three things, and we ſhall take it very kindly at their hands. But till then, they muſt allow us to inſiſt upon it, That ordination by Presbyters, without a Biſhop, is valid and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. — And thus I have done with our Author's <hi>ſecond</hi> Inſtance of the Apoſtles Power over the Reſt of the Miniſters in their Time.</p>
            <p>I ſhall but touch upon the Hint be gives next, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>As to the Power of <hi>cenſuring Offenders</hi> exerciſed by the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> it is plain from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.20.</q>—In anſwer to this, it may be obſerved, That as to the Power of cenſuring Offenders exerciſed by <hi>Presbyters</hi> too, it is equally plain from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 5, 7, 12, 13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.12. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4, 5. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17.— And it is but a juſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence from their having the Power of <hi>Abſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For the Power of <hi>Binding,</hi> and the Power of <hi>Looſing,</hi> are connected, and given in the ſame Commiſſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.23. So that they who are veſted with one of thoſe Powers, have an equal Claim to the other. Now our <hi>Author</hi> himſelf (in his 93d page) expreſly aſcribes to <hi>Presbyters</hi> 
               <q>the Power of <hi>abſolving Offenders</hi> upon their Repentance; which Power (he tells us) is no
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002531_0025_0FDB5BFF59705FF8"/>
other than what they have exerciſed for theſe 1700 years.</q>— And I find in the <hi>Church of England</hi> Form of ordaining <hi>Prieſts,</hi> the Biſhop firſt takes a Promiſe of the Presbyter, to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, <q>That He will give his faithful Diligence always ſo to miniſter the DISCIPLINE of CHRIST, <hi>as the Lord hath commanded:</hi>
               </q> And afterward at the Impoſition of Hands, the Biſhop ſays to him, <q>Whoſe Sins <hi>Thou</hi> doſt forgive, they are forgiven; and whoſe Sins <hi>Thou</hi> doſt retain, they are retained.</q> Which are the very words of the <hi>Apostolical</hi> Commiſſion, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.— And the ſame is repeated at the Conſecration of <hi>Biſhops.</hi> So that it ſhou'd ſeem, the <hi>Church of England</hi> ſuppoſes her <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters</hi> to be equally veſted with the Power of <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> according to the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD; and what <hi>dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> there is in the Exerciſe of it, muſt be grounded on <hi>Civil</hi> Conſtitutions: as indeed ſeems to be hinted to us when the <hi>Biſhop</hi> at his Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, promiſes, <q>to correct and puniſh the Criminous within his Dioceſs, according to ſuch Authority as he <hi>hath <hi>by GOD's Word,</hi>
                  </hi> and as to him <hi>ſhall</hi> be committed by the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of <hi>this Realm.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to proceed with our Author; — He concludes his firſt Head, with <hi>replying</hi> to an <hi>Objection.</hi> 
               <q>The only Anſwer (ſays he) that I know to this Argument, taken from the Apoſtles uſing theſe Powers of Ordination &amp; Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> — That the Apoſtles were <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:002531_0026_0FDB5C00DC9B7C80"/>THIS he is pleas'd to call <hi>a begging of the Queſtion:</hi> and demands of us, <q>Wherein the extraordinarineſs of the Apoſtolick <hi>Office</hi> did conſiſt!</q> Among other Particulars mention'd by him, he queries whether it conſiſted <hi>in their being ſent by</hi> CHRIST: and ſays upon it, <q>So were the <hi>Seventy.</hi>

                  <hi>extraordinary</hi> Men, not only with reſpect to <hi>us,</hi> but alſo with reſpect to the others who liv'd in <hi>their own Time.</hi>
               </q> (Which I hope will ſatisfy our Author.) —So that if the <hi>Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarineſs</hi> of the Apoſtles (<hi>ſuppoſe</hi> it <hi>real</hi>) cou'd be any valid Objection againſt the <hi>Continuance</hi> of Apoſtolical Superiority in ſome over others, the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> muſt needs gain their Point, ſince it appears ſo plainly that the Apoſtles were indeed extraordinary Men. And now, that it wou'd be a <hi>valid</hi> Objection, is evident, in that the Apoſtles Superiority took its <hi>Riſe</hi> from thoſe Things, for which they were extraordinary.

the Will of GOD in certain Laws &amp; Canons, to bind the Church, and in determining matters of Faith, and the like, They did not act in the Quality of <hi>Church-Governors,</hi> ſo much as of Men <hi>extraordinarily</hi> illuminated, and inſpir'd, <hi>infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> to deliver the whole Counſel of GOD to the World. As to any Supremacy of <hi>Office,</hi> this muſt be derived from ſome Commiſſion: which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion muſt be either ordinary or extraordinary, If it was extraordinary, then it is ceaſed; and ſo there can be no Argument form'd for Prelacy, from the Apoſtolical Superiority. And extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary it muſt be, if the Apoſtolical Superiority was properly <hi>ex officio,</hi> ſtrictly <hi>Authoritative.</hi> For I know of no <hi>ordinary</hi> Commiſſion they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, which contain'd any thing more than the ordinary Miniſterial Powers, common to others with them.

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002531_0028_0FDB5C06E1CA8340"/>
I cannot at preſent but be of Opinion, that it was a Superiority of <hi>Dignity,</hi> in reſpect of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Abilities &amp; Privileges, (which gave them a peculiar Influence, &amp; a kind of Authority over Men's Conſciences,) rather than a Superiority of <hi>ruling Power,</hi> in reſpect of any peculiar Office they ſuſtain'd. And of this Opinion I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, until our Opponents can prove that the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> receiv'd ſome <hi>other</hi> Commiſſion from their riſen Lord, beſides that in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. &amp; <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.—or prove that the Commiſſion for the Goſpel-Miniſtry is <hi>more than one;</hi> either by demonſtrating that the Commiſſion of the <hi>Seventy</hi> is of force ſtill, and that with reſpect to the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> or by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſome <hi>new</hi> Commiſſion for Presbyters (<hi>ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi>-Presbyters.) given by CHRIST, or his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles.

            <p>IT is then a very bold &amp; ignorant Conſequence, which our Author draws from his preceding Diſcourſe, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That whoſoever aſſerts the Apoſtolical <hi>Superiority</hi> was only temporary, may as well ſay, that the <hi>Sacraments</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to the Times of the Apoſtles: and indeed the <hi>Quakers</hi> (who ſay ſo) have as conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſons for their Aſſertion, as the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians have for the other.</q> I ſhall make no particular Remarks on this wild Paſſage; becauſe I believe <hi>the Folly of it will be manifest to all Men,</hi> that impartially weigh the Reaſons that have been given to ſupport the Presbyterian Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion.

               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:002531_0030_0FDB5C09D61F1DD0"/>I might alſo here conſider our Author's <hi>Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> from the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which follow next: and I think it might eaſily be made appear, that none of them do eſtabliſh the <hi>Dioceſan Biſhop;</hi> but on the contrary, ſome of them do very plainly make againſt Him. However, it being my Deſign (for Reaſons already mention'd) to confine my ſelf at preſent to <hi>Scripture</hi>-Evidence, I ſhall not enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that Argument.</p>
            <p>BUT I will now proceed to the Author's <hi>laſt</hi> general Head, <hi>Pag.</hi> 90. Where he propoſes to conſider <q>the <hi>Names</hi> given to the ſeveral <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters,</hi> by the Church of <hi>England</hi> in her Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany, <hi>viz. biſhops, Priests,</hi> &amp; <hi>Deacons.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>UNDER this Head He firſt ſpeaks of the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous</hi> uſe of the Names, <hi>Biſhop</hi> &amp; <hi>Presbyter,</hi> in the holy Scriptures, and ſays he thinks <hi>that</hi> will be no Argument for the <hi>Identity</hi> of the <hi>Office.</hi>—To which I ſhall ſay nothing, ſince this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is ſo copiouſly vindicated in the <hi>Sober Remarks.</hi> Only one word, as to our Author's Exception againſt it, from the <hi>Apoſtles Superiority to the reſt of the Clergy.</hi> In which I think there's nothing of weight. For, do's not this Gentleman pretend there were Dioceſan <hi>Biſhops</hi> in the Apoſtles time? And will he not own his ſuppoſed <hi>Biſhops</hi> were <hi>ſubject</hi> to the Apoſtles as well as the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters? Do's not the ſtyle of <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> &amp; <hi>Titus,</hi> carry in it an Air of <hi>Authority,</hi> as much as his Charges to the Elders of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> or any other? And now if the Biſhops were ſubordinate as well as the Presbyters, will not this make all Reaſoning from the <hi>Superiority of the Apoſtles,</hi> of no force? What Argument can be drawn from hence, till it be prov'd that <hi>Biſhops</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:002531_0031_0FDB5C100FB73950"/>
do <hi>ſucceed</hi> the Apoſtles in this Superiority? And how can it be pretended, that they do ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Apoſtles in this Superiority, till it be made appear, either that Biſhops were original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Order of Men <hi>diſtinct</hi> from, and <hi>above</hi> Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters: or that they are indu'd with Apoſtolical <hi>Abilities?</hi> Let our Adverſaries prove one or t'o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe Things: or elſe we cannot believe that Biſhops have any rightful Claim to Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Superiority over Presbyters.</p>
            <p>OUR Author ſays nothing here to ſupport the Epiſcopal Claim, ſave what may be contain'd in that odd and ſurpriſing Paſſage, <hi>Pag.</hi> 91 <q>Since they who in the times of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> were call'd by the Name of <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after their Death diſtinguiſh'd by the Title of <hi>Biſhops;</hi> ſince they, I ſay, were the Perſons to whom the Apoſtles <hi>dying</hi> or <hi>depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> deriv'd their Commiſſion; then it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily follows that they (who in the Apoſtolic Age were call'd Apoſtles &amp; ſoon after Biſhops) had by virtue of that Commiſſion the <hi>full Plenitude</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtolic Power</hi> derived to them from CHRIST: and by the ſame Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity they to whom they delegated their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, received the ſame Power, and ſo down through all the ſucceeding Ages of the Chriſtian Church to this day.</q> — As to the <hi>Truth</hi> of this wonderful Paſſage, I ſhall not at preſent make any Inquiries, becauſe it chiefly relates to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, not in Scripture-Hiſtory: and as to the <hi>Grammar</hi> and <hi>Senſe,</hi> I leave thoſe to clear it up, that have <hi>a better Knack at</hi> criticiſing, and <hi>ſolving Paradoxes, than I can pretend to.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT there is one thing I'd take notice of, that the Gentleman ſays, which will very much hurt
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002531_0032_0FDB5C1159385C20"/>
and perplex his Cauſe; <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>If it is not by vertue of this Commiſſion given to the Apoſtles by our Saviour, that ALL <hi>Goſpel Miniſters</hi> are <hi>authorized</hi> &amp; <hi>ordain'd,</hi> I deſire any one to ſhew what <hi>Authority</hi> they have, &amp; where it is given. If it is by vertue of this Commiſſion that any Man is an <hi>authoriz'd Miniſter,</hi> then it can come by no Hands but the Apoſtles, and them to whom the Apoſtles gave it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE are notable Lines indeed; but I doubt our Author has very much wounded his own Cauſe by them, and contradicted himſelf.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. HE here <hi>relinquiſhes</hi> the Argument from the <hi>Seventy,</hi> and ſo runs counter to the Beginning of his Diſcourſe. There he ſat up the 70 as Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers in the <hi>Goſpel-Church,</hi> and ſuppos'd them to ſubſiſt upon a <hi>diſtinct</hi> Commiſſion from that of the <hi>Eleven Apostles.</hi> But now in the End of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, he <hi>gives up</hi> his Plea from the Seventy, &amp; owns but <hi>one</hi> Commiſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That given to the <hi>Eleven,</hi> by virtue of which any man is an <hi>authoriz'd</hi> Miniſter: — Unleſs perhaps he meant that none cou'd be inveſted in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the <hi>Seventy,</hi> but by <hi>Apoſtles</hi> &amp; <hi>Biſhops;</hi> and ſo all wou'd be ordain'd [in a ſenſe] by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Commiſſion given to the <hi>Eleven.</hi> But that cou'd not be his meaning, becauſe he is here ſpeaking of the Apoſtles <hi>delegating <hi>their</hi>
               </hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, &amp; gives it as his Opinion, "That it was "delegated <hi>to ſome ſuperior to others;</hi> that is, (as we muſt explain him from what he ſays, <hi>pag.</hi> 93.) it was derived to their Succeſſors in <hi>unequal Degrees;</hi> to ſome, <hi>viz. Presbyters,</hi> in <hi>Part;</hi> to others, <hi>viz. Biſhops,</hi> in <hi>Whole.</hi> And (ſays he, in the laſt mention'd page) <q>whatever
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002531_0033_0FDB5C12EB035270"/>
part of the Apoſtolical Authority any Miniſter of the Chriſtian Church duly or validly exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, it is by virtue of a regular <hi>Delegation</hi> from the <hi>firſt Apoſtles</hi> or their Succeſſors.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover,</p>
            <p n="2">2. BY the foremention'd Aſſertion, our Author has <hi>defeated all his Arguments beſides,</hi> &amp; in effect given up his whole Craſe. For, if what he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms be true, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That by virtue of this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion given to the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> ALL Goſpel-Miniſters are <hi>authoris'd;</hi>
               </q> then he has put it out of his own Power, to prove that there is any ſuch Order of Men as <hi>Biſhops,</hi> diſtinct from &amp; ſuperior to Paſtors or Teachers. To ſet this in a clear Light, I argue thus. Whoſoever is authoriz'd by virtue of that Commiſſion, muſt derive his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority from it, either <hi>mediately</hi> &amp; by ſome diſtant Conſequence, or <hi>immediately</hi> and by a direct In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtiture. Now, if ordinary Paſtors &amp; Presbyters are authoriz'd at all by virtue of that Commiſſion, it muſt be by <hi>immediate Inveſtiture.</hi> The <hi>Deacons</hi> indeed have a more remove and mediate or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequential Reference to that Commiſſion: becauſe either their Office was originally <hi>imply'd</hi> in it, but the Apoſtles (by the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>) inſtituted a new &amp; <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Order of Men</hi> to ſuſtain <hi>that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> of the Commiſſion; or elſe a <hi>new Office,</hi> diſtinct from that of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted, by <hi>virtue</hi> of that Commiſſion.—But now as to the <hi>Presbyters,</hi> their Caſe is vaſtly different. For the Presbyters Authority is more <hi>immediately</hi> founded in that Commiſſion, &amp; is not a <hi>ſecondary</hi> Thing. The Miniſterial Commiſſion is but one. I know of no Commiſſion to <hi>preach the Word,</hi> and <hi>adminiſter Goſpel-Sacraments,</hi> but
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002531_0034_0FDB5C18958BEA38"/>
that which was given to the Apoſtles, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. And no man may pretend to do thoſe Things, but by virtue of that Commiſſion, devolv'd upon him. To allude to ſome of our Author's own Words be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quoted; <q>If it is not by virtue of [a direct &amp; proper Inveſtiture in] this Commiſſion given to the Apoſtles by our Saviour, that ALL <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters</hi> are authoriz'd, I deſire any one to ſhew me <hi>what</hi> Authority they have, and <hi>where</hi> it is given.</q> In ſhort, let our Opponents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any Commiſſion that the <hi>Apostles</hi> have given, by virtue of that Commiſſion granted to them, inſtituting an Order of <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters</hi> or Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, not having <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> Powers; and we will yield the Cauſe. Or let 'em prove that the <hi>Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors</hi> of the Apoſtles had <hi>Authority</hi> to conſtitute a new order of mere Presbyters or Subject Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and it will do as well. But till they can perform one or other of theſe Things, they muſt indulge our Weakneſs, if we ſtill adhere to the Opinion, That all Goſpel-Miniſters are in a <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> Way authoriz'd by the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles Commiſſion, or (in other words) actually <hi>inveſted</hi> with it.</p>
            <p>AND now, if it be thus, it muſt need follow, that <hi>Presbyters</hi> &amp; <hi>Biſhops</hi> are of one &amp; the ſame Order and Degree; inaſmuch as their Claim to the Powers contain'd in that Commiſſion, is <hi>equal</hi> &amp; the ſame. So much Truth is there, in that Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our Author's, [<hi>pag.</hi> 91.] <q>That whatever Power the <hi>Apostles</hi> had <hi>by virtue of that Commiſſion,</hi> Thoſe to whom they deriv'd that Commiſſion, muſt neceſſarily be veſted with <hi>the ſame;</hi>— and had by virtue of that Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the <hi>full Plenitude</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtolic Power,</hi> derived to 'em from CHRIST.</q> Hence then,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002531_0035_0FDB5C19A1A4E270"/>
ſeeing <hi>All Goſpel-Miniſters</hi> or <hi>Teachers</hi>] are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd immediately by that Commiſſion, They muſt be veſted with the <hi>whole</hi> ordinary Power therein contain'd: and <hi>Biſhops</hi> can pretend to <hi>no more.</hi> Therefore Biſhops &amp; Presbyters are the ſame.</p>
            <p>I can ſee no Foundation in the world, for that <hi>Distinction</hi> our Author makes, in his 93d page, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>That the Apoſtles gave to ſome <hi>All</hi> their Power; but to others they only gave <hi>Part</hi> of their Power.</q> He makes this Diſtinction, in Reply to an <hi>Objection.</hi> 
               <q>If any (ſays he) ask how Presbyters can exerciſe thoſe Powers [namely, <hi>of preaching,</hi> and <hi>adminiſtring Goſpel-Sacraments,</hi> &amp; <hi>of abſolving Offenders upon their Repentance</hi>] without being Apoſtles or Biſhops, ſince our Savior gave that Commiſſion <hi>only</hi> to the Apoſtles as ſuch: <hi>I anſwer,</hi> It is true our Savior gave thoſe Powers <hi>only</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles;</hi> but he gave them Authority to delegate that Power to whom they thought fit and worthy; and they gave to ſome <hi>all</hi> their Power (&amp; ſo they were as much Apoſtles as the firſt Eleven were) but to others they only gave <hi>Part</hi> of their Power; <hi>viz.</hi> To preach, and adminiſter the Sacraments.</q>— This is his Anſwer: but I think it will no way ſolve the Difficulty, nor ſerve his cauſe.</p>
            <p>IN the firſt place, I <hi>deny</hi> his <hi>Distinction</hi> here, to have any Foundation <hi>in the Word of God.</hi> For the Miniſterial Commiſſion is but one; and they that are ordain'd to the Office of the Goſpel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry inſtituted in that Commiſſion, are inveſted with all the Powers that belong to that Office by Divine Inſtitution —. Obſerve, our <hi>Author</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf confeſſes, that theſe Powers were at frſt
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002531_0036_0FDB5C1E76BB5E28"/>
given <hi>only</hi> to the Eleven <hi>Apoſtles:</hi> and to them, they were given <hi>Equally.</hi> Hence then, ſuch as <hi>ſucceed</hi> Them, muſt be likewiſe <hi>Equal</hi> Sharers in all thoſe Powers, and the Miniſterial Commiſſion muſt belong to them alike, in its full Extent <note n="‖" place="bottom">See the <hi>Sober Remarks,</hi> (upon <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19, 20.) where <hi>this Point</hi> is more largely debated.</note>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs the Apoſtles in CHRIST's name have made ſome Limitations. And the Proof of this is what we demand. This Gentleman peremptorily aſſerts, that the Apoſtles gave their Power to ſome only in <hi>Part,</hi> and with Reſtrictions. But this is ſooner affirm'd than prov'd. I ſhall only ſay here; Had the Apoſtles convey'd their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial Powers unto others, in various Degrees, (to ſome <hi>All,</hi> to others only a <hi>Part</hi>) they wou'd neceſſarily have ſet up a <hi>new</hi> &amp; <hi>diſtinct Officer</hi> in Him that had only a <hi>Part:</hi> and if there had been a diſtinct Officer ſet up by them, they wou'd doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have given him ſome diſtinguiſhing <hi>Name</hi> to be known by, and have ſtated his peculiar <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications</hi> to regulate the Choice of him, and have introduc'd him into his Work by a diſtinct <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> or Conſecration <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But we find no Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of theſe Things in the ſacred Records. The Names of thoſe that the Apoſtles ordain'd to the Goſpel-Miniſtry in every Church, [ſuch as <hi>Biſhops, Presbyters, Paſtors, Teachers,</hi> &amp;c.] are promiſcuouſly apply'd: and the ſame Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are indifferently requir'd of them all. And their Ordination is univerſally the ſame: and their Work the ſame. Where then is there any Scripture Ground for our Author's Diſtinction? Surely it can be nothing but a mere Fiction, to help a lame Cauſe, that needs ſuch Aſſiſtences!
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002531_0037_0FDB5C2116CF89E0"/>
And whatever pretended Sanction it may receive from human Authority &amp; Cuſtom, this will never warrant ſuch a Diſtribution and Separation of the Powers and Parts of a Divine Commiſſion. We may properly enough apply here that ſaying of our Saviour, <hi>What therefore God hath joyned toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, let not Man put aſunder.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HOWEVER, to take our Author once more in his own way, I will ſuppoſe, that the Apoſtles actually did derive their Power to others with a <hi>Difference,</hi> to ſome <hi>All,</hi> and to others only a <hi>Part.</hi> I will ſuppoſe there are <hi>Elders,</hi> who have no Power of <hi>Rule,</hi> but are emphatically <hi>Teachers,</hi> having only Power to <hi>preach,</hi> and adminiſter the <hi>Sacraments:</hi> Yet I cannot ſee at preſent how our Author can improve ſuch a Conceſſion to ſerve his Cauſe. For this will not neceſſarily infer a Subordination among the Miniſters of the Goſpel. I'll give two Reaſons why I think ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> that belongs to Eccleſiaſtical Rulers, is over <hi>the People,</hi> &amp; not over the <hi>Teachers</hi> of the People.

And, what is more, Miniſters are expreſly <hi>forbidden</hi> to uſurp Authority over their Brethren in the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.25. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [See the <hi>Sober Remarks,</hi> on this Text, <hi>pag.</hi> 99. <hi>Edit.</hi> 2.]</p>
            <p n="2">2.

There is no force then in the pretended Example of Scripture-Deacons, to prove that Deacons as ſuch, &amp; in ordinary Caſes may preach &amp; baptize. But ſays our Author they are veſted with Power to do this, <hi>by their Ordination.</hi> By which he muſt mean either the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Ordination, or the <hi>Church of England</hi>-Ordination. I think He could not mean the <hi>Former;</hi> becauſe in the beginning of the ſame Paragraph, he owns that the <hi>firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of that order in the Church, was to take Care of the Poor:</hi> and indeed He muſt have been ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blind or wilful, if he had deny'd this. For no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more evident from the Inſtitution (<hi>Act.</hi> 6.) than that Deacons originally were Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers of the <hi>Poor,</hi> &amp; ordain'd to <hi>ſerve Tables,</hi> which the Apoſtles wou'd not <hi>leave the Word of God</hi> to do. <q>But in proceſs of Time, (ſays one) when the Revenues of the Church were enlarg'd, the Caſe was greatly alter'd: the Biſhops affected to be Guardians of the Poor, and to make the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons Amends admitted them to preach &amp; bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize. The Biſhops omit Preaching, &amp; become
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002531_0043_0FDB5C2F69AAFE00"/>
ſervants of Tables: and the Deacons from ſerving of Tables ſtep up into the Pulpit &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Preachers.</q> Agreebly the Church of <hi>England</hi> allows her Deacons to be Preachers and Baptiſer. And moſt probably it might be <hi>Her Ordination,</hi> which our Author refer'd to when he ſaid that Deacons, are <hi>by their Ordination, veſted with a power of preaching by the Biſhops Licence.</hi> But then I ask, What Authority hath the Church to <hi>alter</hi> Divine Inſtitutions? If the Inſtitution (in <hi>Acts</hi> 6.) doth not give Deacons ſuch a Power, I deſire our Author to ſhew me what <hi>Commiſſion</hi> the Church of <hi>England</hi> hath to give it them: and if he cannot produce any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to warrant the Church's giving it them, than the Biſhop's Licence is but Vanity &amp; Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, &amp; the <hi>Epiſcopal Deacons</hi> are condemned out of our Author's own mouth, in that paſſage, [<hi>pag.</hi> 93.] <q>Whoever pretends to exerciſe any part of the Miniſterial Office, without a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> Delegation or Miſſion, is an <hi>Intruder into the Prieſts Office,</hi> &amp; every <hi>Act</hi> of his is <hi>Null</hi> &amp; <hi>Void,</hi> &amp; in the Scripture-ſtyle <hi>an abomination to the Lord.</hi>
