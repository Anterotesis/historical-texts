            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But underſtand me right, Father: Though I don't aſſent to the ſum-total of your accuſations, poſſibly I may acknowledge ſome of the items; the beſt actions frequently appear culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, merely becauſe their motives are unexplained. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore produce your charges, let me juſtify my conduct, and I doubt not I ſhall retrieve my reputation from your hands as immaculate and pure as a new ſheet of foolſcap.</p>

I proteſt I do what I can to preſerve my modeſty; and I wiſh that Archbiſhop Dunſtan had heard the lecture upon chaſtity which I read laſt night to the dairy-maid in the dark! he'd have been quite edified. But yet what does talking ſignify? The eloquence of my lips is counteracted by the luſtre of my eyes; and really the little devils are ſo tender, and ſo troubleſome, that I'm half angry with nature for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made me ſo very bewitching.</p>

In fact, I deſerved it; for I cannot deny but that at twenty I was as good-for-nothing a knave as ever exiſted; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently old Earl Percy diſmiſſed me from his ſervice, but I know that it was ſorely againſt your inclination. You were

In ſpite of my knavery and tricks, I was conſtantly upon the point of ſtarving; and having once contracted an idle habit of eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I never could bring myſelf to leave it off. After living five years by my wits, want drove me almoſt out of them. I knew not what courſe to take, when I heard that Earl Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond's jeſter had fled the country. I exerted my knavery for the laſt time in ſtealing the fugitive's caſt coat, was accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his place by the Earl, and now gain an honeſt liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by perſuading my neighbours that I'm a greater fool than themſelves.</p>

                     <p>Oh! that will never do; for in the firſt place you'll not be able to get a ſight of him. I've now lived with him five long years, and, till Angela's arrival, never witneſſed a gueſt in the Caſtle. Oh! 'tis the moſt melancholy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! And as to its maſter, he's the very antidote to mirth. He always walks with his arms folded, his brows bent, his eyes lowering on you with a gloomy ſcowl. He never ſmiles; and to laugh in his preſence would be high treaſon. He looks at no one, ſpeaks to no one. None dare approach him, except Kenric and his four blacks; all others are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to avoid him; and whenever he quits his room, ding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dong goes a great bell, and away run the ſervants like ſo many ſcared rabbits.</p>

Unluckily, the only ſervant who eſcaped the ſlaughter, depoſed, that he recognized among the aſſaſſins a black ſtill in the ſervice of Earl Oſmond. The truth of this aſſertion was never known, for the ſervant was found dead in his bed the next morning.</p>

                     <p>If Percy gains her, every thing! Supported by ſuch wealth and power, dangerous would be her claim to theſe domains ſhould her birth be diſcovered. Of this our Lord is aware; nor did he ſooner hear that Northumberland loved her, than he haſtened to remove her from Allan's

                     <p>If ſhe loves well, ſhe will. Saib, I too have loved! I have known how painful it was to leave her on whom my heart hung! how incapable was all elſe to ſupply her loſs! I have exchanged want for plenty, fatigue for reſt, a wretched hut for a ſplendid palace. But am I happier? Oh! no! Still do I regret my native land, and the partners of my poverty. Then toil was ſweet to me, for I laboured for Samba; then repoſe ever bleſt my bed of leaves, for there by my ſide lay Samba ſleeping.</p>

                     <p>Did it? Oh Saib; my heart once was gentle, once was good! But ſorrows have broken it—inſults have made it hard! I have been dragged from my native land! from a wife who was every thing to me, to whom I was every thing! Twenty years have elapſed ſince theſe Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians tore me away; they trampled upon my heart, mocked my deſpair; and, when in frantic terms I raved of Samba, laughed, and wondered how a negro's ſoul could feel! In that moment, when the laſt point of Africa faded from my view, when as I ſtood on the veſſel's deck, I felt that all I loved was to me loſt forever! In that bitter moment did I baniſh humanity from my breaſt! I tore from my arm the bracelet of Samba's hair, I gave to the ſea the precious token, and, while the high waves ſwift bore it from me, vowed aloud endleſs hatred to mankind. I have kept my oath, and I <hi>will</hi> keep it.</p>

                     <p>Willingly. You are to know, that ſince the late Earl's death, the Caſtle is thought to be haunted; the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants are fully perſuaded that his ghoſt wanders every night through the long galleries, and parades the old towers and dreary halls which abound in this melancholy manſion. He is ſuppoſed to be dreſt in a complete armour; and that which you wear at preſent was formerly his. Now hear my plan. The Earl prepares to hold a conference with Lady Angela; even now I heard her ſummoned to attend him in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moury. Placed upon this pedeſtal, you may liſten to their diſcourſe unobſerved, and thus form a proper judgment both of your miſtreſs and her guardian. As ſoon as it grows dark, I will conduct you to Angela's apartments: the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity will then ſhelter you from diſcovery; and even ſhould you be obſerved, you will paſs for Earl Reginald's ſpectre.</p>

Above all, they ſay that the ſpirit of the late Counteſs ſits nightly in her Oratory, and ſings her baby to ſleep. However, if it be ſo— <stage>[A bell ſounds thrice, loud and ſolemn]</stage>—Hark!

For ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen long years have I thirſted; and now, when the cup of joy again ſtands full before me, ſhall I daſh it from my lip? No, Angela, you aſk of me too much. Since the moment when I pierced her heart, deprived of whom life became odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; ſince my ſoul was ſtained with his blood who loved me, with her's whom I loved, no form has been grateful to my eye, no voice ſpoken pleaſure to my ſoul, ſave Angela's, ſave only Angela's! Doating upon one whom death has long claſped in his arms; tortured by deſires which I never hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſatisfy, many a mournful year has my heart known no throb but of anguiſh, no gueſt but remorſe at committing a fruitleſs crime. Hope, that ſtranger, once more viſits my boſom: the fiend, who led me through paſſion's mazes to the heights of guilt, owns that a crime ſo great well merits a reward. He bids the monument's jaws uncloſe: Evelina revives in her daughter, and ſoon ſhall the fires which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume me be quenched in Angela's arms. What though her heart be Percy's? What though ſhe prefer a baſiliſk's kiſs to mine? Becauſe my ſhort-lived joy may cauſe her eternal ſorrow, ſhall I reject thoſe pleaſures ſought ſo long, deſired ſo earneſtly? That will I not, by Heaven! Mine ſhe is,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034000_0020_0FF9FBE9F85616B0"/>and mine ſhe ſhall be, though Reginald's bleeding ghoſt flit before me, and thunder in my ear—"Hold! hold!"—Peace, ſtormy heart! She comes!</p>

                     <p>Obſerve this picture; it conceals a ſpring, whoſe ſecret is unknown to all in the Caſtle except myſelf. Upon touching it, the pannel ſlides back, and a winding paſſage opens into the marble hall; thence we muſt proceed to the vaulted veſtibule; a door is there concealed ſimilar to this; and, after threading the mazes of a ſubterranean labyrinth, we ſhall find ourſelves in ſafety on the outſide of the Caſtle walls.</p>

<pb n="41" facs="unknown:034000_0041_0FF9FD3303AE4A90"/>together through life—partners in pleaſure, partners in woe. And when the night of our exiſtence arrives, one ſpot ſhall receive our bodies—one ſtone ſhall cover our grave. Allan too, and the worthy Maud!—my parents—my more than parents! to ſmooth the pillow of their age—to gild their laſt hours with ſun-ſhine! that thought is heaven. So glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious are my proſpects, that they dazzle me to look on, and ſcarce can I believe them really to exiſt. Oh! gracious God! ſhould my brain be bewildered by fancy—ſhould I be now the ſport of ſome deceitful dream, ſeal up my eyes forever, never let me wake again!—I muſt not expect the Friar before one; till that hour arrives, will I kneel at the feet of yonder Saint, there tell my beads, and pray for morning.</p>

I was ſcarce fifteen, when ſhe kindled a flame in my heare while lighting the kitchen fire, and from that moment I thought on nothing but her.

                     <p>Why, at length, my Lord, a Pindaric Ode upon her grace in frying pancakes melted her heart. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to be mine; when, oh! cruel fortune, taking one night a drop too much—poor dear creature, ſhe never got the better of it! I wept her loſs, and compoſed an elegy upon it, which has been thought, by many perſons of great judgment, not totally deſtitute of taſte and ſublimity. It began thus:
