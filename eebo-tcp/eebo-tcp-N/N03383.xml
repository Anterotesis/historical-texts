            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I. I am, in the <hi>firſt place,</hi> to open to you the character of the <hi>Godly man</hi> and the <hi>Faithful man,</hi> the perſons mention'd in the text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And <hi>firſt,</hi> I ſhall ſpeak of the <hi>Godly man;</hi> the <hi>foundation-ſtroke</hi> in whoſe character is, his <hi>faith in God</hi> as a being infinitely great and glorious; the creator and governour of the World, the ſaviour and rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him: according to that of the <hi>apoſtle,</hi> Heb. 11. 6. <hi>Without faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe</hi> God: <hi>For he that cometh to God muſt believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is his faith, in the being and attributes and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of God, a <hi>meer ſpeculative notion;</hi> but an <hi>active living principle,</hi> ſuitably exciting and moving the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> of his mind.</p>
            <p>He ſo believes the <hi>majeſty</hi> and <hi>power</hi> of God, as to be fill'd with an habitual <hi>awe</hi> and <hi>reverence</hi> of him; dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his diſpleaſure, being much more afraid to offend him than any <hi>other Being</hi> whatſoever; in conformity to that caution of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Luk. 12. 4, 5. <hi>Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do. But I will forewarn you, whom ye ſhall fear: Fear him, which, after he hath killed, hath power to caſt into hell; yea, I ſay unto you, fear him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſo believes the <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> and <hi>veracity</hi> of God, as to rely on <hi>his word,</hi> confide in the <hi>truth</hi> and depend on the <hi>fulfilment of his promiſes:</hi> And however little appearance, humanely ſpeaking, there may be at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, of their accompliſhment, <hi>he ſtaggers not at the promiſe of God through unbelief; but is ſtrong in faith, giving glory to God: being perſuaded, that what he hath promiſed, he is able alſo to perform.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſo believes in God as a being infinitely <hi>amiable, beautiful</hi> and <hi>deſirable,</hi> as to <hi>love him with all his heart, and ſoul, and mind, and ſtrength;</hi> eſteeming his <hi>favor as life,</hi> and his <hi>loving-kindneſs better than life.</hi> None <hi>in

heaven,</hi> in his account, is <hi>like unto God,</hi> nor does he <hi>deſire any on earth beſides him:</hi> And his chief concern is, that God would be his friend, his God and <hi>portion forever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſo believes the <hi>paternal care, kindneſs</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God, as to place his intire <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in him; <hi>truſting in the Lord at all times:</hi> Eſpecially, making God <hi>his refuge</hi> in the <hi>day of his diſtreſs;</hi> relying on him for all that help and ſalvation, which is <hi>in vain to be looked for from the hills, and the multitude of mountains,</hi> and is to be had only in God, the <hi>ſaviour of his people in the time of trouble.</hi> Yea, he is ſo firmly perſuaded of the <hi>love</hi> and <hi>pity</hi> of God towards <hi>them that fear him,</hi> that he <hi>caſts his whole care upon him; taking no thought,</hi> no inordinate thought, <hi>for his life, what he ſhall eat, or what he ſhall drink, or wherewithal he ſhall be cloathed:</hi> as knowing, that God <hi>feedeth the fowls of the air, and cloatheth the lilies of the field,</hi> and <hi>will much more feed and cloath</hi> his own children, who are <hi>much better than they.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſo believes the <hi>ſupreme authority,</hi> and <hi>ſovereign univerſal dominion of God,</hi> as to <hi>acquieſce</hi> in all his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; not daring to diſpute his pleaſure, or reſiſt his will, or find fault with or murmur againſt his providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diſpenſations. That's the habitual inward ſenſe and temper of his mind, <hi>It is the Lord, let him do what ſeemeth him good.</hi> He is willing, at the call of God, to part with any thing, his reputation, his intereſt, his friends; yea, he <hi>counts not his life dear</hi> ſo he may but honour God, and <hi>finiſh his courſe with joy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, he ſo believes in God as <hi>ſending his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten ſon</hi> into the world, <hi>not to condemn the world, but that the world thro' him might be ſaved,</hi> that he hopes for ſalvation in <hi>none</hi> but <hi>in Chriſt:</hi> and <hi>thro' him,</hi> and the <hi>merits of his mediatorial undertaking</hi> for ſinners, he truſts in the mercy of God to eternal life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:004129_0006_1003D17F05667240"/>
But this is not all.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Godly man's faith in God</hi> has a powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on his <hi>life</hi> as well as <hi>heart.</hi> It not only excites an <hi>internal regard</hi> towards God in the <hi>affections of his mind,</hi> but a due care to expreſs this regard in all proper acts of outward <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The bleſſed God is the <hi>conſtant object</hi> of his <hi>external homage and worſhip.</hi> He is a man of prayer; delights in the duty, and is frequent in the practice of it. He is one that <hi>prays without ceaſing;</hi> is habitually in a <hi>praying frame,</hi> and improves every proper ſeaſon of <hi>making known his requeſts to God by prayer, with ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and thankſgiving.</hi> He daily retires from the world, and <hi>enters into his cloſet,</hi> and <hi>prays to his father who is in ſecret,</hi> and hears in ſecret in order to his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warding openly.</hi> And as becomes a man of Godlineſs, he <hi>every day</hi> takes care, that the <hi>morning and evening ſacrifice</hi> aſcends up to God from his <hi>family,</hi> as the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual burnt-offering:</hi> Nor is he content with theſe more <hi>private</hi> duties of devotion: but is conſtant at the <hi>houſe of God,</hi> ſerious and reverent in his attendance on the exerciſes of <hi>publick worſhip,</hi> both <hi>in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And very particular is the regard which he pays to the <hi>Lord's ſabbath.</hi> 'Tis his great concern and care to ſanctifie this <hi>day of God;</hi> not allowing himſelf to <hi>do his own ways, or find his own pleaſure, or ſpeak his own words.</hi> He religiouſly ſeperates himſelf from the world, reſts from all its labours and employments, and ſpends the time in the ſervice of God, and to the purpoſes of piety and devotion.</p>
            <p>And he pays a great regard to the <hi>word</hi> as well as <hi>ſabbath</hi> of God; conſulting it upon all occaſions, as the <hi>man of his counſel,</hi> his main guide in the way of duty. The <hi>ſcripture</hi> he receives as <hi>given by inſpiration of God:</hi> And becauſe 'tis <hi>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs,</hi> he repairs to it as a ſuitable
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004129_0007_1003D1930E37B1B8"/>
means in order to his becoming <hi>perfect</hi> as a <hi>man of God,</hi> and <hi>throughly furniſhed unto all good works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In a word, the <hi>Godly man</hi> is one that expreſſes a due regard to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>every thing that bears relation to him,</hi> thro' the general tenour of his actions. He is one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted to God; and 'tis his deſire and care, that his whole external conduct may expreſs the higheſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of him. He would not willingly do any thing offenſive to God, but every thing pleaſing in his ſight. He aims at the glory of God; and what gives the finiſhing ſtroke in his character, conſtantly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to be as <hi>like him</hi> as poſſible. He continually ſets God before him as his <hi>pattern and exemplar,</hi> and is <hi>an imitator of him as a dear child.</hi> He has no higher ambition than to <hi>reſemble God,</hi> and 'tis his daily care to appear in the world, in ſome proportion, a <hi>living image of him;</hi> being <hi>holy as he is holy, and perfect as his father in heaven is perfect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. But I muſt now go on in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, to ſpeak of the <hi>Faithful man.</hi> The text makes mention not only of the <hi>Godly man,</hi> but the <hi>Faithful man.</hi> And the <hi>character</hi> is capable of being underſtood in a <hi>variety</hi> of ſenſes, according to the <hi>various uſe</hi> of the word <hi>Faithful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>Sometimes, it relates to our <hi>words,</hi> and means the ſame thing with <hi>ſpeaking the truth.</hi> Hence that of Prov. 14. 5. <hi>A faithful witneſs will not lie.</hi> And in this ſenſe of the word, the <hi>faithful man</hi> is a man of <hi>truth and veracity;</hi> one who makes conſcience of his <hi>words</hi> as well as <hi>actions.</hi> Lying and deceit are <hi>abomination</hi> to him, as they are to the <hi>holy God.</hi> He knows not how to utter a falſhood, nor dare he do it, nor will he ever knowingly break in upon the law of truth. He is one whoſe word may be rely'd on. There is an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between his <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>tongue.</hi> He believes what he ſays, and when ever he ſpeaks, 'tis under the <hi>habitual

influence</hi> of thoſe <hi>apoſtolic</hi> injunctions<note n="*" place="bottom">Col. 3. 9.</note>, <hi>Lie not one to another, ſeeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. 4. 25.</note> 
               <hi>Wherefore putting away lying, ſpeak every man truth with his neighbour: for we are members one of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes again, the word <hi>faithful</hi> relates to our <hi>promiſes,</hi> and intends <hi>faithfulneſs in performing them.</hi> Thus 'tis uſed, 1 Theſ. 5. 24. <hi>Faithful is he who calleth you, who alſo will do it.</hi> And in this ſenſe, the <hi>faithful man</hi> is one who will <hi>ſtand to his word,</hi> be punctual in a compliance with his engagements. He is not one of thoſe who make promiſes to ſerve a <hi>preſent turn,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any intention to perform them: But when ever he paſſes his word, he <hi>ſpeaks the truth in his heart,</hi> honeſtly deſigns to do what he ſays; looking upon his word as ſacred, and himſelf as ſolemnly bound by it: Nor will he fail if poſſible, of an exact compliance with it. Yea, ſo punctual is he to his word, ſo exact to his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that he'll be faithful to comply, tho' it be to his real damage. As the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> has drawn his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note n="‖" place="bottom">Pſal. 15. 4.</note>, <hi>tho' he ſweareth to his own hurt, he changeth not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sometimes again, the word <hi>faithful</hi> relates to a <hi>truſt committed to us,</hi> and means the ſame thing with <hi>fidelity in the diſcharge of it.</hi> And this is the moſt <hi>proper</hi> as well as <hi>common</hi> ſenſe, in which it is uſed in <hi>ſcripture.</hi> In this ſenſe of the <hi>word,</hi> we read of <hi>Moſes</hi> in that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Numb. 12. 7. <hi>My ſervant Moſes,—who is faithful in all my houſe.</hi> So of <hi>David,</hi> 1 Sam. 22. 14. <hi>Who is ſo faithful among all thy ſervants as David.</hi> So of <hi>Daniel,</hi> Dan. 6. 4. <hi>Foraſmuch as he was faithful; neither was there any error or fault found in him.</hi> And in this ſenſe of the <hi>word,</hi> the <hi>faithful man</hi> is one who uſes <hi>fidelity in the truſt repoſed to him.</hi> Whatever the betruſtment be that is committed to him, whether it relates to the <hi>ſouls</hi> or <hi>bodies</hi> of men, their <hi>temporal</hi> or
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004129_0009_1003D1A738D22098"/>
               <hi>ſpiritual</hi> concerns, he'll endeavour to be anſwerable to it, by a conſciencious care to diſcharge the duties ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and required of him. He won't betray his truſt, nor ſhrink from under the burdens of it; neither will he let it ſuffer thro' neglect, or a carleſs, ſlothful, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active management of it: but will be tho'row and effectual in doing the duties belonging to it. He looks upon his truſt as committed to him by God. He realiſes the eye of God upon him; and upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of religion, a regard to God and the good of men, behaves with care and prudence, and diligence. He expects to be called to an account at the great day of reckoning, how he has manag'd his truſt, and therefore applies himſelf to the proper duties of it, with the greateſt care; being active and laborious in doing what he has been call'd to in the providence of God: And he is ſolicitous to do what he does in the <hi>beſt manner,</hi> ſo as ſhall <hi>beſt</hi> anſwer the end of his betruſtment, and ſo as that he may finally come off with the teſtimony of a good conſcience, the approbation of men; and what is of infinitely more worth, the approbation of his <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Judge,</hi> ſaying unto him, in the great day of his appearing, <hi>Well done, thou good and faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; thou haſt been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: Enter thou into the Joy of thy Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In fine, the word <hi>faithful</hi> is ſometimes taken in a large and extended ſenſe, ſo as to mean the ſame thing with <hi>fidelity in the whole work of religion.</hi> Thus 'tis uſed, Rev. 2. 10. <hi>Be thou faithful to death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</hi> And this is one thing, perhaps the chief thing intended, when we read, in the <hi>epiſtles</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> of this and the other fellow Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, in that ſtile, <hi>a faithful ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And in this ſenſe of the word, the <hi>faithful man</hi> is one, who employs himſelf with <hi>fidelity in the great buſineſs of religion.</hi> He does not content himſelf with vain
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004129_0010_1003D1B05B6E7218"/>
wiſhes and faint ineffectual endeavours; but is active and ſtirring in the <hi>work of God</hi> and <hi>his ſoul's ſalvation.</hi> His concern is, to fill up his time with work and labour; <hi>doing with his might whatſoever his hand findeth to do:</hi> conſidering there is <hi>no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave, whither he goeth.</hi> He conſiders the <hi>ſeveral relations</hi> he ſuſtains in the world, and is ſollicitous to do <hi>the duties of them.</hi> He conſiders the <hi>various talents</hi> committed to him by his great Lord, and uſes his <hi>beſt ſkill</hi> to improve them to the <hi>beſt advantage.</hi> He conſiders the particular <hi>ſtate and condition of life</hi> it has pleaſed God to place him in, and is careful to behave in it to the <hi>honour of God</hi> and his <hi>own final good account.</hi> In a word, his great aim is, <hi>to ſerve God and his generation according to the will of God;</hi> and this is the chief care, the main endeavour of his life.</p>
            <p>And thus you have ſeen the variety of ſenſes, in which a man may be characteris'd as a <hi>faithful man.</hi> The <hi>particular ſenſe,</hi> in which the <hi>deſcription</hi> is to be underſtood in the <hi>text,</hi> is not certain: nor is it material. For in <hi>either ſenſe,</hi> the <hi>character</hi> is <hi>beautiful</hi> and <hi>lovely;</hi> and affords juſt ground for lamentation, when perſons ſo excellent and deſirable <hi>ceaſe from among men.</hi> And this brings me,</p>
            <p>II. In the <hi>ſecond place,</hi> to explain the ſenſe, in which the <hi>Godly and faithful</hi> are ſaid, in the <hi>text,</hi> to <hi>ceaſe and fail from among the children of men.</hi> And there are two ſenſes, in which the words may be explain'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They may be underſtood of <hi>the death</hi> of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and Godly. And the death of this kind of perſons is a common caſe. The <hi>Godly</hi> are equally expos'd to death with the <hi>ungodly,</hi> and will as ſurely fall by the ſtroke of it, ſooner or later. There is <hi>no diſcharge in this war</hi> for <hi>ſaints</hi> any more than <hi>ſinners. Holineſs</hi> it ſelf will not ſecure from the <hi>firſt,</hi> however it will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004129_0011_1003D1B958DFC858"/>
from the <hi>ſecond death.</hi> Says the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Heb. 9. 27. <hi>It's appointed for all men once to die.</hi> Agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able whereto is that of the inſpir'd <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſalm 89. 48. <hi>What man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee death?</hi> The ſenſe is, there is no man, let him be who he will, or his moral character what it will, but he ſhall <hi>as ſurely die as he is now alive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the <hi>Godly</hi> have always been ſubjected to death in common with others. We read of <hi>Noah, Abraham, Moſes,</hi> and a long liſt of <hi>celebrated ſaints,</hi> in that lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, <hi>Theſe all died in faith.</hi> 'Tis through <hi>the dark valley of the ſhadow of death,</hi> that the ſaints have all along, through the ſeveral ſucceſſive ages of the world, paſſed into the heavenly ſtate; and they muſt paſs the <hi>ſame way</hi> ſtill, in order to their arriving at the <hi>ſame bleſſed place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, this <hi>removal of the Godly and faithful by death,</hi> is what the holy <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> might have particularly in his view, when he ſpeaks in the <hi>text,</hi> of their <hi>ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and failing from among the children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis obſervable, <hi>Ahimelech,</hi> a <hi>Godly faithful man,</hi> and together with him, no leſs than <hi>fourſcore and five Prieſts of the Lord,</hi> were ſlain upon the ſpot, by the command of <hi>Saul,</hi> in the days of <hi>David</hi> and upon <hi>his account;</hi> as we may read, in the 22d. <hi>Chapter</hi> of the <hi>firſt book</hi> of <hi>Samuel.</hi> It might poſſibly be upon <hi>this,</hi> or ſome ſuch ſad and remarkable <hi>ceaſing and failing of the Godly and faithful by death,</hi> that <hi>David</hi> uttered theſe words: or, he might cry out in the language of the <hi>text,</hi> upon the news of the deceaſe of ſome pious and faithful friend. 'Tis thought, that <hi>Samuel,</hi> the <hi>Lord's prophet,</hi> a <hi>Godly man,</hi> and one of <hi>David'</hi>s beſt and moſt <hi>faithful friends,</hi> died about the time of the compoſure of this <hi>Pſalm:</hi> Upon which, ſays one, <q>When I read, 1 Sam. 25. 1. <hi>That Samuel died, and all the Iſraelites were gathered together, and lamented him, and buried him in his houſe in Ramah;</hi> methinks I hear <hi>David</hi> among the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004129_0012_1003D1C08690F438"/>
                  <hi>mourners,</hi> crying out with the greateſt ſorrow and concern, <hi>Help Lord, for the Godly man ceaſeth, for the faithful fail from among the children of men.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And 'tis with great juſtneſs and propriety, the <hi>Godly and faithful</hi> may be ſaid to <hi>ceaſe and fail from among the children of men,</hi> when they are <hi>taken away by death.</hi> For an <hi>end</hi> is now, at once, put to their <hi>being</hi> on the earth; and we may ſay of them in the language of holy <hi>Job</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Job 7. 8.</note>, <hi>The eye of him that hath ſeen them, ſhall ſee them no more.</hi> For they are <hi>gone,</hi> as he elſewhere obſerves<note n="†" place="bottom">—10. 21.</note>, <hi>whence they ſhall not return, even to the land of darkneſs, and the ſhadow of death.</hi> Agreable whereto is that elegant deſcription he has given us of death<note n="‖" place="bottom">7. 9. 10.</note>, <hi>As the clod is conſumed and vaniſheth away, ſo he that goeth down to the grave ſhall come up no more to his houſe, neither ſhall his place know him any more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The words may be underſtood of the <hi>ceaſing of the Godly and faithful, thro' the growing corruption and degeneracy of the times.</hi> And this is the ſenſe, in which the words are moſt commonly explain'd. Says a <hi>learned Annotator</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">Bp. Patrick in Loc.</note>. <q>This <hi>Pſalm</hi> was compos'd in a very <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt age,</hi> in which it was hard to find an <hi>honeſt plain-dealing man,</hi> in whom one might confide.</q> To be ſure, we often find this <hi>holy man of God</hi> lamenting the <hi>badneſs of the times,</hi> complaining of the increaſe of wickedneſs, a univerſal degeneracy. Says he, in the <hi>verſe</hi> following the <hi>text, They ſpeak vanity every one with his neighbour: with flattering lips and a double tongue do they ſpeak.</hi> And he makes that ſad remark, Pſalm 14. 2, 3. <hi>The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to ſee if there were any that did underſtand and ſeek God. They are all gone aſide, they are altogether become filthy, there is none that doth good, not one.</hi> And ſome ſuppoſe, that this might probably be the ſtate of things, when <hi>David</hi> penned the <hi>text.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004129_0013_1003D1C6E2993938"/>
There was ſo little an appearance of real virtue and goodneſs, and ſo great an appearance of vice and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, among all ſorts of perſons, that he trembled at the ſad proſpect, and could not refrain from <hi>applying to God for help.</hi> 
               <q>We may charitably and reaſonably hope, ſays a celebrated writer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there were many ſerious and upright men in the land; as there were <hi>ſeven thouſand</hi> in the days of <hi>Elijah,</hi> who maintain'd their integrity, when he thought there had been none beſides himſelf: But it ſeems they were ſo private and concealed, ſo much out of <hi>David</hi>'s view and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation,</q> that he feared they were <hi>ceas'd from among the children of men:</hi> at leaſt, the defection was ſo general, that he thought he had juſt reaſon to take up his lamentation, and <hi>go to God for help.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it muſt be acknowledged, there is not a more awful token of the diſpleaſure of almighty God, than the <hi>general ceaſing of Godly and faithful men.</hi> When men of known piety and fidelity fail from among a people, by being <hi>call'd out</hi> of the world; or when they ceaſe by means of the <hi>growing degeneracy of the times,</hi> 'tis a ſad ſymptom, and bodes ill to a people: Nor is there a <hi>more proper ſeaſon,</hi> nor can there be <hi>greater reaſon,</hi> to <hi>cry after God</hi> in the language of the <hi>text.</hi> And this leads to the third thing propos'd, which was,</p>
            <p>III. To ſhow what reaſon there is to <hi>cry to God for help,</hi> when the <hi>Godly and faithful fail from among men.</hi> And there is good reaſon for this upon the following accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is juſt ground of fear, what God may be about to do againſt a people, when the Godly and faithful ceaſe from among them:</hi> And this, whether they ceaſe by <hi>death,</hi> or the <hi>growing degeneracy of the age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If they ceaſe by <hi>reaſon of Death,</hi> 'tis a <hi>ſad preſage of evil a coming.</hi> For <hi>Godly faithful men</hi> are the <hi>defence</hi> and <hi>ſafety</hi> of the places where they live. So good
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004129_0014_1003D1CCE37A2B28"/>
               <hi>Joſiah</hi> was the protection of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> While he was alive, God would not bring <hi>deſerved evil</hi> upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but as ſoon as he was <hi>gathered to his fathers,</hi> the <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned calamities brake in upon them.</hi> And 'tis often the method of providence, to remove good men by death, to make way for the execution of his judgments. 'Tis obſervable, the firſt thing we read of, after the <hi>death</hi> and <hi>burial</hi> of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that <hi>holy man of God,</hi> is, that <hi>the Moabites invaded the land</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Kings, 13. 20.</note>. And 'tis particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark't of the <hi>righteous,</hi> that <hi>they are taken away from the evil to come</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah 57. 1.</note>. As one expreſſes it, "There is great cauſe of fear, when God <hi>houſes his dear and faithful ſervants,</hi> leſt ſome <hi>heavy ſtorm of Judgment ſhould be ready to break upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or, if the <hi>Godly and faithful ceaſe by means of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wickedneſs,</hi> there is the ſame, or rather, greater reaſon for fear, what may be the event. There is no <hi>worſe ſymptom</hi> upon a people than that of <hi>increaſing degeneracy.</hi> When <hi>Godlineſs fails</hi> thro' the prevalency of <hi>profaneneſs and impiety;</hi> when real vertue and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ceaſes, thro' and overballance of vice and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, 'tis a <hi>ſad prognoſtic of impending judgment.</hi> For it has always been the method of heaven, to teſtify againſt the <hi>degeneracy of a people;</hi> eſpecially has this been the method of providence, when the <hi>defection is great;</hi> God is generally neglected, his ordinances de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and ways forſaken.</p>
            <p>The <hi>ceaſing of Godly and faithful men</hi> is therefore a matter that adminiſters <hi>juſt ground of fear,</hi> leſt the effect ſhould be ſomething <hi>ſad and ſorrowful</hi> in the courſe of divine providence. We may, in this caſe, well <hi>tremble for fear of God, and be afraid of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> And if ever, there is <hi>now reaſon to ſeek the Lord,</hi> and cry earneſtly to him <hi>for help;</hi> eſpecially, if we go on, and conſider in the ſecond place,</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004129_0015_1003D1E96EC13530"/>
2. That <hi>help may be obtained from God, and can be had from none elſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Godly and faithful ceaſe by means of death,</hi> he can raiſe up and qualify others to ſtand in their place and make their ground good. The <hi>reſidue of the ſpirit</hi> is with him: and he can cauſe the <hi>ſpirit of Elijah to reſt on Eliſha.</hi> As he takes Godly uſeful men out of the world by <hi>death,</hi> he can raiſe up others, and form within them like principles of univerſal goodneſs. He can make them men of like piety and integrity, of like truth and fidelity, of like zeal for the divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and of like extenſive ſerviceableneſs in their day and generation. And <hi>God only</hi> can do this. In vain is it to look for help, in this matter, from any but <hi>him.</hi> He only forms the ſpirit of man within him, and he only can form men for his own glory.</p>
            <p>Or, if the <hi>Godly and faithful ceaſe by the prevailing badneſs of the times,</hi> in this caſe alſo, <hi>God only can afford help.</hi> When a people are become generally corrupt and wicked, the powerful interpoſition of God, and this only, will be <hi>effectual,</hi> to reſtrain them from vice, and bring them back to the practice of religion and virtue. They may poſſibly think there is little need of the <hi>Divine help,</hi> and be apt to leave God out of all their thoughts. But if ever they are reformed, and recovered to their duty, it muſt be by means of <hi>help obtained from God.</hi> Says the <hi>Prophet,</hi> beſpeaking the <hi>Jewiſh Nation</hi> in the name of God, <hi>O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf; but in me is thy help</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hoſ. 13. 9.</note>. And <hi>Ephraim,</hi> by whom we are to underſtand the <hi>Kingdom of Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>ten tribes;</hi> I ſay, <hi>Ephraim</hi> is repreſented as being made ſenſible, that <hi>his help was only in God;</hi> and is therefore brought in, applying to God in that ſerious and pertinent language, <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned; for thou art the Lord my God</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Jeremiah 31. 16.</note>. If it ſhall
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004129_0016_1003D1DEA0BABD08"/>
pleaſe <hi>God,</hi> by the <hi>powerful influence</hi> of his grace and ſpirit, to <hi>turn a degenerate people</hi> from their vices and follies, they will then be <hi>effectually turned;</hi> and <hi>not elſe.</hi> It can be done by <hi>no other power,</hi> by <hi>no other means,</hi> in <hi>no other way.</hi> Says the <hi>prophet,</hi> affording <hi>direction</hi> to a ſinful people, in their <hi>return to the Lord their God, Take with you words, and turn to the Lord: ſay unto him, Take away all iniquity, and receive us graciouſly,</hi> Hoſea 14. 2.</p>
            <p>Now, as <hi>help may be had from God,</hi> and can be had <hi>from none elſe,</hi> this is a <hi>good reaſon,</hi> why we ſhou'd ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to him for it: Eſpecially if it be added in the next place,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That <hi>he expects to be ſought to for help.</hi> And this is <hi>very particularly</hi> his expectation from a <hi>ſinful and degenerate people:</hi> Nor without ſuitably applying to God, may they hope to receive <hi>that help,</hi> without which they muſt <hi>periſh in their iniquities.</hi> 'Tis remarkable, when God had promiſed his people of old, to <hi>cleanſe them from their filthineſs,</hi> to <hi>give them a new heart,</hi> and <hi>put his ſpirit within them,</hi> to make them a <hi>Godly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people,</hi> he adds upon it, in that expreſs and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory language, <hi>I will yet for this be enquired of by the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. 36. 37.</note>. And when God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends mercy to a people <hi>fallen by their iniquities,</hi> he does not <hi>ordinarily</hi> beſtow it, till they are <hi>brought upon their Knees,</hi> and earneſtly <hi>pray for it.</hi> Says God to his people <hi>Iſrael,</hi> Jer. 29. 11. <hi>I know the thoughts that I think towards you, thoughts of peace and not of evil.</hi> It follows in the next words, <hi>Then ſhall ye call upon me, and ye ſhall go and pray unto me, and I will hearken unto you. And ye ſhall ſeek me and find me, when ye ſhall ſearch for me with all thine heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon theſe and ſuch like grounds, we ſhould be <hi>crying to God for help,</hi> when the <hi>Godly and faithful

            <p>Only, when we <hi>ſeek to God for help,</hi> let us remember to do it in the <hi>Name of Chriſt;</hi> according to our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's own <hi>direction</hi> as well as <hi>encouragement,</hi> John 14. 13, 14. <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall aſk in my name, that will I do; that the father may be glorified in the ſon.

            <p>And our <hi>prayer for help</hi> ſhould be put up likewiſe, with a becoming <hi>ſeriouſneſs, reverence</hi> and <hi>ſubjection of ſoul;</hi> not pretending to preſcribe to God the <hi>time,</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> or <hi>method</hi> of helping us; but leaving it with his own infinite wiſdom and goodneſs, to manage the matter as he knows to be beſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Application</hi> now remains.</p>
            <p>And it ſhall be in one word, turning the diſcourſe into a <hi>ſerious exhortation;</hi> beſeeching us to apply our ſelves to God, in the language of holy <hi>David</hi> in the text, <hi>Help Lord! for the Godly man ceaſeth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And conſidering our preſent circumſtances, perhaps there is as much reaſon for the prayer <hi>now,</hi> as there was in the days of <hi>David.</hi> How many holy good men, men of eminent piety and fidelity, both in <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> have been remov'd out of the <hi>land</hi> by <hi>death,</hi> within the compaſs of a few years!</p>
            <p>What a <hi>ceaſing</hi> has there been among our <hi>Godly faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful magiſtrates?</hi> How many have been taken away of <hi>late years,</hi> who were Zealous for the honour of God, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004129_0018_1003B5281CE86BD0"/>
ſought the welfare of their people; men of known integrity and impartial diſtribution of juſtice, <hi>the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of God for good; not terrors to good works, but the evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And if we look into the <hi>Sepulcres of the prophets,</hi> how many ſhall we find there, who, not many years ſince, ſhone among us as <hi>Stars of the firſt magnitude;</hi> men eminently pious and laborious, wiſe and prudent, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and uſeful, and greatly renown'd for the <hi>gifts of grace,</hi> as well as their <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>acquired accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in <hi>private life</hi> likewiſe, how many have fail'd from among us by reaſon of <hi>death?</hi> Men devout to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; men of conſcience and religion; men of faith and prayer, <hi>ſound in God's ſtatutes,</hi> and of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary good <hi>converſation in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what is ſtill more lamentable, what a fearful <hi>ceaſing</hi> has there been of the <hi>Godly and Faithful,</hi> thro' the <hi>growing degeneracy</hi> of <hi>all ſorts</hi> of perſons among us? How general has been our revolt from God, our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for real and ſubſtantial goodneſs?</p>
            <p>The bleſſed God might beſpeak us, with relation to our <hi>original</hi> or <hi>firſt exiſtence as a people,</hi> in the language of Jer. 2. 2, 3. <hi>I remember thee the kindneſs of thy youth, the love of thine eſpouſals, when thou wenteſt after me in the wilderneſs, in a land that was not ſown. Iſrael was holineſs to the Lord, and the firſt fruits of his increaſe.</hi> But might he not expoſtulate with us, as in the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing verſes, <hi>Hear ye the word of the Lord, O houſe of Jacob, and all the families of the houſe of Iſrael: Thus ſaith the Lord, what iniquity have ye found in me, that ye are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</hi> It may, with great propriety, be ſaid of <hi>New-England</hi> as in Judges 2. 7. <hi>And the people ſerved the Lord all the days of Joſhua, and all the days of the elders that out lived Joſhua, who had ſeen all the great works of the Lord, that he did for Iſrael.</hi> But may
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004129_0019_1003D1FA04690358"/>
it not, with as much truth and juſtneſs, be added, as follows in the 10, 11, 12. verſes, <hi>And all that genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were gathered unto their fathers: And there aroſe another generation after them, which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he did for Iſrael. And the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael did evil in the ſight of the Lord,—and they forſook the Lord God of their fathers.—</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we conſider the great piety of our progeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; their reverence towards God, their love to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, their zeal for the purity of the Goſpel worſhip, their contempt of the world, their ſelf denying temper and conduct; and in a word, their holy and exemplary walk in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord: I ſay, when we conſider theſe things, and then take a <hi>comparative view of our ſelves,</hi> we have reaſon to bluſh and be aſhamed to think, how dreadfully we are degenerated. The holy God might lament over us, as he once did over his people <hi>Iſrael</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah 1. 4.</note>, <hi>Ah ſinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed of evil doers, children that are corrupters: they have forſaken the Lord, they have provoked the holy one of Iſrael to anger, they are gone away backward.</hi> We have riſen up in our <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>faithful fathers</hi> ſtead, a generation that have wickedly departed from the Lord: And 'tis aſtoniſhing to think, to what a height we are grown in impiety and prophaneneſs, in formality and hypocriſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in injuſtice and oppreſſion, in pride and ambition, in covetouſneſs and worldlineſs, in rioting and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in chambering and wantonneſs, in voluptuouſneſs and a univerſal debauchery of manners.</p>
            <p>Upon this view of the ſtate of things in our land, we have ſurely reaſon, infinite reaſon for humiliation and mourning; to lament not only the <hi>ceaſing of the godly and faithful by death;</hi> but the <hi>ceaſing of their Spirit,</hi> their piety and integrity, their zeal for God and the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004129_0020_1003D204024859C0"/>
eſtabliſhment of true religion, thro' the prevalence of evil and all manner of wickedneſs, which, like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing flood, threatens to overflow the land.</p>
            <p>'Tis certainly time, high time to <hi>cry to God for help.</hi> And this we have been doing the <hi>week paſt,</hi> on the day of our ſolemn <hi>faſting and praying.</hi> But have we not reaſon for inquiry, did we then <hi>keep a faſt unto God, even unto God, an acceptable faſt, the faſt which he hath choſen?</hi> If ſo, we ſhall not think it enough, that we have <hi>confeſſed</hi> and <hi>externally humbled</hi> our ſelves for our ſins; but <hi>we</hi> ſhall <hi>forſake them,</hi> making it our care to <hi>turn every man from the evil of his ways.</hi> We ſhall <hi>looſe the bands of wickedneſs, undo the heavy burdens, and let the oppreſſed go free.</hi> We ſhall <hi>deal our bread to the hungry, and bring the poor that are caſt out to our houſe:</hi> When we <hi>ſee the naked we ſhall cover him,</hi> and we <hi>ſhall not hide our ſelf from our own fleſh. Then ſhall our light break forth as the morning, and our health ſhall ſpring forth ſpeedily, and our righteouſneſs ſhall go before us: the glory of the Lord ſhall be our rereward. Then ſhall we call, and the Lord ſhall anſwer; we ſhall cry, and he ſhall ſay, here I am.</hi> Then ſhall God appear for our help, revive among us the <hi>good ſpirit of our Godly faithful Progenitors; pour out his ſpirit upon us, and his bleſſing on our offspring:</hi> making our <hi>ſeed and name,</hi> like the <hi>new heavens and the new earth,</hi> to remain for ever.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall be yet more particular, and take liberty to addreſs the exhortation to <hi>this flock of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> calling upon you, to plead with God in the words of the text, <hi>Help Lord! for the Godly man ceaſeth, for the faithful fail from among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Great has been the <hi>ceaſing of Godly Faithful</hi> perſons among us, both <hi>men</hi> and <hi>women,</hi> within theſe few years. The <hi>ancient ſtrong pillars</hi> of this Church are moſtly thrown down by death. The <hi>hoary heads</hi> of thoſe numbers of <hi>venerable aged diſciples,</hi> which were once as a
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004129_0021_1003D20585D875C0"/>
               <hi>crown of glory</hi> to this aſſembly, are now laid in the dark and ſilent grave: and <hi>ſmall is the remnant that is left.</hi> Like the <hi>gleaning of the vintage,</hi> they are thinly ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd, but here and there one to be ſeen in the <hi>place of worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis worth our remark, the <hi>continuance of old men,</hi> the protracting their days, is particularly mention'd as one of the <hi>ſignal bleſſings</hi> of that <hi>happy time,</hi> which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>promiſe of God,</hi> we are looking and hoping, and praying for. To this purpoſe we read, Iſa. 65. 19, 20. <hi>And I will rejoice in Jeruſalem, and joy in my people:—There ſhall be no more thence an old man that hath not fill'd his days.</hi> And on the other hand, the <hi>ceaſing of old men</hi> is made, in <hi>ſcripture,</hi> a very ſevere token of the Divine diſpleaſure: according to that <hi>threatning of God</hi> againſt the <hi>houſe of Eli,</hi> 1 Sam. 2. 31. <hi>Behold the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy Father's houſe, that there ſhall not be an old man in thine houſe:</hi> Agreable whereto is that <hi>ſorrowful exclamation,</hi> Iſa. 3. 1, 2. <hi>For behold, the Lord, the Lord of hoſts, doth take away from Jeruſalem, and from Judah,—the prudent and the ancient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A <hi>general failing of aged ſaints</hi> ſhould therefore be eſteem'd a <hi>ſorrowful humbling article,</hi> in the courſe of Divine providence. And as there has viſibly been a <hi>very great ceaſing</hi> of the <hi>aged diſciples</hi> of this Church, we ſhould, as 'tis our duty, religiouſly obſerve and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the hand of God herein.</p>
            <p>But what I would more eſpecially call upon you to lament is, the <hi>ceaſing</hi> of thoſe <hi>Godly</hi> and <hi>Faithful</hi> men, the manner of whoſe <hi>holy life</hi> and <hi>happy death</hi> is yet freſh in our remembrance.</p>

You are all witneſſes of his holy and heavenly walk among you; of his being to you <hi>an example, in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity.</hi>—But his excellent cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter having been already laid open to you, by a better and more proper hand, I ſhall only add that <hi>exhortation</hi> of the <hi>apoſtle,</hi> adapting it to the preſent caſe, Heb. 13. 7. <hi>Remember him, who had the rule over you, who ſpoke unto you the word of God: whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of his converſation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It remains now to take ſome proper notice of the more ſpecial occaſion of my bringing you ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe at this time; the death of that <hi>valuable</hi> perſon, it pleaſed the holy God to take from us the laſt week.</p>
            <p>I could not refrain from dropping a tear over his grave: Nor can I ſuppoſe, that any that knew him will except againſt a publick recommending an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in many reſpects, ſo worthy of imitation.</p>
            <p>The perſon, whoſe deceaſe we are lamenting, was an inſtance of <hi>early piety.</hi> He <hi>betimes</hi> enter'd upon a religious courſe, and had made good progreſs in the way of God's commandments. He was a chearful,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004129_0024_1003D2144DD3E2F0"/>
active, good Chriſtian; a hearty lover of God and all good men; eſpecially the Godly faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, whom he highly eſteemed for their work's ſake, often ſhewing them the kindneſs of the Lord. He was a man of prayer; conſtant at the houſe and worſhip of God; true to his word; punctual to his engagements; ſincere in his profeſſions; charitable in his deeds, being always ready to every good work; an upright, ſober, honeſt, faithful man; one that <hi>feared God above many,</hi> and <hi>walk'd in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameleſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As a <hi>Deacon,</hi> he was <hi>grave, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy lucre; holding the myſtery of the faith in a pure conſcience:</hi> And he <hi>uſed his office, being found blameleſs.</hi> He was indeed excellently turn'd and ſpirited to it; and by his active, conſtant, prudent and faithful attendance on the duties of it, was a ſignal bleſſing in his place, and known and acknowledg'd to be ſo.</p>
            <p>It may be ſaid of him, with truth and juſtice, he was generally beloved while <hi>living,</hi> and as generally lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted now he is <hi>dead.</hi> And in <hi>his death,</hi> the <hi>Town</hi> have loſt a man <hi>uſeful in his generation;</hi> the <hi>Church,</hi> a <hi>faithful officer</hi> as well as <hi>generous benefactor;</hi> and the <hi>poor,</hi> an <hi>open-banded</hi> and <hi>compaſſionate friend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall only add, as he was one who <hi>lived to Chriſt,</hi> we have reaſon to hope he <hi>died in him:</hi> And of ſuch the apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſpeaks in that remarkable language, Rev. 14. 13. <hi>I heard a voice from heaven, ſaying to me, write, bleſſed are the dead which are in the Lord, from henceforth: Yea, ſaith the ſpirit, that they may reſt from their labours; and their works do follow them.</hi>

thoſe who have no hope: For if Chriſt died and roſe again, even ſo them alſo which ſleep in Jeſus, will God bring with him.</hi> Wherefore <hi>comfort</hi> your ſelves and <hi>one another with theſe words.</hi> And beware of witholding from God the glory of his ſovereign dominion. <hi>Be dumb with ſilence,</hi> and <hi>open not your mouths,</hi> unleſs it be to acknowledge and adore the ſovereignty, and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and wiſdom, and righteouſneſs of this diſpenſation; and to ſupplicate at the throne of God all that ſupport and comfort you need. And let it be your care to make a wiſe and holy uſe of this providence. Learn herefrom the uncertainty of all earthly enjoyments; and more than ever truſt in God, and make him your hope and happineſs. Chuſe your <hi>father's God</hi> for <hi>your God;</hi> and <hi>know him and ſerve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind:</hi> So will he be your friend and father; your guide thro' the world; your guide thro' death, and <hi>your portion for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, my <hi>brethren,</hi> the ceaſing of ſuch <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>faithful men by death,</hi> is a frown of providence, and a ſore breach upon us. Let us not be inſenſible of our <hi>great loſs</hi> in the <hi>many deaths,</hi> there have been, of late, among us. Our glory is hereby thinned, our ſtrength impaired, and we are gradually becoming weak and feeble. Let us lift up a cry to almighty God with holy <hi>David, Help Lord! for the Godly man ceaſeth; for the Faithful fail from among the children of men.</hi> And let there be no reaſon for that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, <hi>the righteous periſheth, and no man layeth it to heart.</hi> Let us duly reſent the removal of our <hi>pious brethren in Chriſt,</hi> and be concerned to ſee their places fill'd. And let us be conſtant and fervent in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications to God, to <hi>be the repairer of our breaches;</hi> to make <hi>daily additions</hi> to us, of thoſe who ſhall be men of like piety and integrity, with thoſe who are gone off the ſtage.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:004129_0026_1003D21D95B9B4E0"/>
I ſhall only add, have we not reaſon to fear, whether there han't been a <hi>far more awful ceaſing</hi> of the Godly and faithful from among us, through the <hi>growing wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the preſent day,</hi> than by means of <hi>death?</hi> O let us lament our grievous <hi>departures from the living God!</hi> He, <hi>which ſearcheth the reins and hearts,</hi> might juſtly beſpeak us, as he once did the <hi>Church of Epheſus, I have ſomewhat againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt left thy firſt love</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 2. 4.</note>. And the <hi>exhortation</hi> following hereupon, is as applicable to us as them,<note n="†" place="bottom">verſ. 5.</note> 
               <hi>Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy firſt works.</hi> O let us not be inſenſible of the ſad low ſtate of religion among us! Let it deeply affect us to think, how far we generally fall ſhort of that <hi>chriſtian ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>heavenly good converſation,</hi> for which our <hi>predeceſſors</hi> were remarkable. And let us be mightily concerned for the <hi>revival of the things</hi> among us, <hi>which remain, and are ready to die.</hi> Let that be our ardent prayer to God, the God of all grace, <hi>O Lord, revive thy work in the midſt of the years, in the midſt of the years make known; in wrath remember mercy.</hi> Or, in thoſe well adapted words of the <hi>inſpired Pſalmiſt,</hi> let us with one united voice make our ſupplications, <hi>Return, we beſeech thee, O God of hoſts; look down from heaven, and behold, and viſit this vine—which thy right hand hath planted. Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the ſon of man, whom thou madeſt ſtrong for thy ſelf: ſo will we not go back from thee. Turn thou us again, O Lord of hoſts, cauſe thy face to ſhine, and we ſhall be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And may it pleaſe the good and gracious God, as <hi>Godly faithful</hi> men are cauſed to <hi>ceaſe from among us by death,</hi> to raiſe up others, from time to time, to ſupply their place! And may there never be wanting a <hi>Godly ſeed</hi> to ſerve God, and uphold the <hi>Goſpel wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip

            </p>
            <p>And may it pleaſe the <hi>glorious King</hi> on God's <hi>holy hill of zion,</hi> to <hi>ſanctify and cleanſe</hi> this his Church!
