            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>THE following is extracted from Dr. Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell's remarks upon the climate of N. York.</p>

"THE ſtate of New-York lies between the fortieth and forty-fifth degrees of north latitude; and on comparing it upon the globe, with the parts of Europe ſituated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſame parallels, a ſtranger might be led to conjecture that its climate reſembled that of the country between Naples and Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice, or Oporto and Bourdeaux—yet there is undoubtedly a conſiderable difference; ſince it has been long known, that the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratures of countries are to be eſtimated, not merely by their diſtance from the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, but alſo by their remoteneſs from the margin and level of the Ocean.</p>

If high in the air, and far from us, they will do miſchief; but if near us, may deſtroy trees, animals, or men—And the nearneſs or diſtance may be computed by the interval of time betwixt the flaſh and the noiſe.

Then after a pauſe of ten minutes more, the ſea begins to flow as before, and ſo alternately. The

When the Moon enters the firſt and third quarter; that is, at the new and full Moon, the tides are high and ſwift, and called ſpring tides: when ſhe enters the ſecond and laſt quarter, the tides are weaker, and are called neap tides.

He is of a large ſize, near four feet long from the point of the bill to the end of the tail; and betwixt the points of each wing, when extended, near ſix feet; his beak is very ſtrong, crooked and ſharp, ſo alſo are his talons or claws.</p>

They build their neſts generally on the ſides of high and, inacceſſible rocks, or on the tops of old de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cayed large trees, and ſeldom lay above two eggs at a time.

The tooth of the male of this beaſt grows to be ten feet long; ſome elephant's teeth have been ſeen, that they ſay have weighed, ſingle, three hundred pounds weight. The teeth of the female are reckoned more precious than thoſe of the male.

Others are of opinion, that the cock that lays the egg ſits upon, and hatches it himſelf. Theſe monſters are bred in Africa, and ſome other parts of the world. Authors differ about the bigneſs of it; ſome ſay it is a ſpan in compaſs, and half a foot long; others will have it to be three or four feet long, and ſome the thickneſs of a man's wriſt, and proportionable in length. The eyes of a cockatrice are red. Its poiſon is ſo ſtrong, that there is no cure for it. As all other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents are afraid of the fight and hiſſing of a cockatrice, ſo is the cockatrice itſelf very fearful of a weaſel, which, after it has eaten rue, will ſet upon, and deſtroy the cockatrice. Beſides this little animal, it is ſaid, there is no other creature in the world able to contend with it. The poiſon inſects the air to ſuch a degree, that no other creature can live near him. It kills, not only by his touch, but by fight and hiſſing.</p>

               <head>IN PRAISE OF VIRTUE.</head>
               <p n="30">30. VIRTUE is of intrinſic value and good deſert, and of indiſpenſible obligation; not the creature of will, but neceſſary and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable; not local or temporary, but of equal extent and antiquity with the divine mind; not a mode of ſenſation, but ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting truth; not dependent on power, but the guide of all power.</p>
               <p n="31">
                  <pb n="126" facs="unknown:023387_0128_0FBF6822FB864800"/>31. VIRTUE is the foundation of honor and eſteem; and the ſource of all beauty, order, and happineſs in nature. It is what confers value on all the other endowments and qualities of a reaſonable being, to which they ought to be abſolutely ſubſervient, and without which the more eminent they are, the more hideous deformities, and the greater curſes they become. The uſe of it is not confined to any one ſtage of our exiſtence, or to any particular ſituation we may be in, but reaches through all the periods and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of our beings.</p>
               <p n="32">32. MANY of the endowments and talents we now poſſeſs, and of which we are too apt to be proud, will ceaſe entirely with the preſent ſtate; but this will be our ornament and dignity in every future ſtate to which we may be removed. Beauty and wit will die, learning will vaniſh away, and all the arts of life be ſoon forgot; but virtue will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main for ever.</p>
               <p n="33">33. THIS unites us to the whole rational creation, and fits us for converſing with any order of ſuperior natures, and for a place in any part of God's works. It procures us the approbation and love of all wiſe and good beings, and renders them our allies and friends.—But what is of unſpeakably greater conſequence is, that it makes God our friend, aſſimilates and unites our minds to his, and
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:023387_0129_0FBF682B0F295518"/>
engages his almighty power in our defence: Superior beings of all ranks are bound by it no leſs than ourſelves. It has the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in all worlds that it has in this. The farther any being is advanced in excellence and perfection, the greater is his attachment to it, and the more he is under its influence. To ſay no more, it is the law of the whole univerſe; it ſtands firſt in the eſtimation of the Deity; its original is his nature; and it is the very object that makes him lovely.</p>
               <p n="34">34. Such is the importance of virtue—Of what conſequence, therefore, is it, that we practiſe it! there is no argument or motive, which is at all fitted to influence a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mind, which does not call us to this.— One virtuous diſpoſition of ſoul is preferable to the greateſt natural accompliſhments and abilities, and of more value than all the treaſures of the world. If you are wiſe, then ſtudy virtue, and contemn every thing that can come in competition with it. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that nothing elſe deſerves one anxious thought or wiſh. Remember, that this alone is honor, glory, wealth, and happineſs. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure this, and you ſecure every thing; loſe this, and all is loſt.</p>

                  <p n="44">44. I CONSIDER a generous mind as the nobleſt work of the creation, and am perſuaded, wherever it reſides no real merit can be wanting. It is, perhaps, the moſt ſingular of all the moral endowments: I am ſure, at leaſt, it is often imputed where it cannot juſtly be claimed. The meaneſt ſelf-love, under ſome diſguiſe, frequently paſſes upon common obſervers for this god-like principle; and I have known many a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar action attributed to this motive, when it

                     </gap>owed from no higher a ſource than the ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of concealed vanity, good nature; as it hath many features in common with this virtue, is uſually miſtaken for it: The former, however, is but the effect, poſſibly, of a happy diſpoſition of the animal ſtructure, or, as Dryden calls it, of a certain "milki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of blood;" whereas the latter is ſeated in the mind, and can never ſubſiſt where good ſenſe, and enlarged ſentiments, have no exiſtence.</p>
                  <p n="45">45. IT is entirely founded upon juſtneſs of thought, which, perhaps, is the reaſon this virtue is ſo little the characteriſtic of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                     </gap>l ones; and his generoſity is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely circumſcribed, becauſe his reaſon is exceedingly limited.</p>
                  <p n="46">46. IT is the diſtinguiſhing pre-eminence of the chriſtian ſyſtem, that it cheriſhes this elevated principle in one of its nobleſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

I have often, however, wondered that the ancients, who raiſed ſo many vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and affections of the mind into divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſhould never have given a place in their temples to generoſity; unleſs, perhaps, they included it under the notion of <hi>fides,</hi> or <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p n="47">47. A principle of honor may reſtrain a man from counteracting the ſocial ties, who yet has nothing of that active flame of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity, which is too powerful to be confined within the humbler boundaries of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>re ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative duties. True generoſity riſes above the ordinary rules of ſocial conduct, and flows with much too full a ſtream to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended within the preciſe marks of formal precepts. It is a vigorous principle in the ſoul, which opens and expands all her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues far beyond thoſe which are only the forced and unnatural productions of a timed obedience. The man who is influenced ſingly by motives of the latter kind, aims no higher than at certain authoritative ſtandards, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever attempting to reach thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious elevations which conſtitute the only true heoriſm of the ſocial character.</p>

               <p n="2">2. THE firſt book, Geneſis, contains the moſt grand, and, to us, the moſt intereſting events that ever happened in the univerſe;
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:023387_0174_0FBF68B4E6277C90"/>
the creation of the world, and of man; the deplorable fall of man, from his firſt ſtate of excellence and bliſs, to the diſtreſſes in which we ſee all his deſcendants continue; the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death pronounced on Adam, and on all his race; with the reviving promiſe of that deliverance, which has ſince been wrought for us by our bleſſed Saviour; the account of the early ſtate of the world; of the univerſal deluge; the diviſion of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into different nations and languages; the ſtory of Abraham, the founder of the Jewiſh people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoſe unſhaken faith and obedience under the ſevereſt trial human nature could ſuſtain, obtained ſuch favor in the ſight of God, that he vouchſafed to ſtile him his friend, and promiſed to make his poſterity a great nation; and that in his ſeed, that is, in one of his deſcendants, all the kingdoms of the earth ſhould be bleſſed. This you will eaſily ſee, refers to the Meſſiah, who was to be the bleſſing and deliverance of all nations.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IT is amazing that the Jews, poſſeſſing this prophecy, among many others, ſhould have been ſo blinded by prejudice, as to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

upon earth, to this or that particular ſect or profeſſion, when he is ſo clearly and emphatically deſcribed as the Saviour of the whole world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THE ſtory of Abraham's proceeding to ſacrifice his only ſon, at the command of God, is affecting in the higheſt degree; and ſets forth a pattern of unlimited reſignation, that every one ought to imitate in thoſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als of obedience under temptation, or of acquieſcence under afflicting diſpenſations, which fall to their lot. Of this we may be aſſured, that our trials will be always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned to the powers afforded us; if we have not Abraham's ſtrength of mind, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall we be called upon to lift the bloody knife againſt the boſom of an only child; but, if the almighty arm ſhould be lifted up againſt him, we muſt be ready to reſign him, and all we hold dear, to the divine will.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THIS action of Abraham has been cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by ſome, who do not attend to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between obedience to a ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and the deteſtably cruel ſacrifices of the Heathens, who ſometimes voluntarily, and without any divine injunctions, offered up their own children, under the notion of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing the anger of their gods. An abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute command from God himſelf, as in the caſe of Abraham, entirely alters the moral nature of the action; ſince he, and he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:023387_0176_0FBF68BE9EDD8128"/>
has a perfect right over the lives of his creatures, and may appoint whom he will, either Angel or Man, to be his inſtrument of deſtruction.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THAT it was really the voice of God which pronounced the command, and not a deluſion, might be made certain to Abraham's mind, by means we do not comprehend, but which we know to be within the power of him, who made our ſouls as well as bodies, and who can controul and direct every fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of the human mind: and we may be aſſured, that if he was pleaſed to reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo miraculouſly, he would not leave a poſſibility of doubting, whether it was a real or an imaginary <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thus the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Abraham appears to be clear of all ſuperſtition; and remains the nobleſt inſtance of religious faith and ſubmiſſion, that was ever given by a mere man: we cannot wonder that the bleſſings beſtowed on him, extended to his poſterity.</p>
               <p n="7">7. THIS book proceeds with the hiſtory of Iſaac, which becomes very intereſting to us, from the touching ſcene I have mentioned, and ſtill more ſo, if we conſider him as the type of our Saviour.

               <p n="1">1. IN Exodus you read of a ſeries of wonders, wrought by the Almighty to reſcue the oppreſſed Iſraelites, from the cruel tyranny of the Egyptians, who, having firſt received them as gueſts, by degrees re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to a ſtate of ſlavery. By the moſt peculiar mercies and exertions in their favour, God prepared his choſen people to receive, with reverent and obedient hearts, the ſolemn reſtitution of their primitive laws, which probably he had revealed to Adam and his immediate diſcendants, or which at leaſt, he had made known by the dictates of conſcience; but which time, and the dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neracy of mankind, had much obſcured.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THIS important revelation was made to them in the wilderneſs of Sinai, when, aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled before the burning mountain,
<q>ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with blackneſs, and darkneſs, and tempeſt,</q>

to the Jews, and through them tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to other nations; and by that means a great reſtraint was oppoſed to the torrent of vice and impiety, which began to prevail over the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To thoſe moral precepts, which are of perpetual and univerſal obligation, were ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded, by the miniſtration of Moſes, many peculiar inſtitutions, wiſely adopted to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ends, either to fix the memory of thoſe paſt deliverances, which were figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a future and far greater ſalvation, to place inviolable barriers between the Jews and the idolatrous nations, by whom they were ſurrounded, or to be the civil law by which the community was to be governed.</p>
               <p n="4">4. To conduct this ſeries of events, and to eſtabliſh theſe laws with his people, God raiſed up that great prophet Moſes, whoſe faith and piety enabled him to undertake and execute the moſt arduous enterpriſes, and to purſue, with unabated zeal, the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of his countrymen. Even in the hour of death, this generous ardour ſtill prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: his laſt moments were employed in fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent prayers for their proſperity, and in rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous gratitude for the glimpſe vouchſafed him of a Saviour far greater than himſelf, whom God would one day raiſe up to his people.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="unknown:023387_0191_0FBF68E962929218"/>
care to obſerve the chronology regularly, by refering to the index, which ſupplies the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies of this hiſtory from Joſephus's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities of the Jews. The firſt of Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees carries on the ſtory until within 195 years of our Lord's circumciſion: the ſecond book of the ſame narrative is written by a different hand, and does not bring the hiſtory ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as the firſt; ſo that it may be entirely omitted, unleſs you have the curioſity to read ſome particulars of the heroic conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Jews under the tortures inflicted by their heathen conquerors, with a few other things, not mentioned in the firſt book.</p>
               <p n="5">5. YOU muſt then connect the hiſtory by the help of the index, which will give you brief heads of the changes that happened in the ſtate of the Jews from this time until the birth of the Meſſiah.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THE other books of the Apocrypha, though not admitted as of ſacred authority, have many things well worth your attention; particularly the admirable book called Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticus, and the book of Wiſdom. But in the courſe of reading, which I adviſe, theſe muſt be omitted until after you have gone through the Goſpels and Acts, that you may not loſe the hiſtorical thread.</p>

WE come now to that part of ſcripture which is the moſt important of all, and which you muſt make your conſtant ſtudy, not only until you are thoroughly acquainted with it, but all your life long; becauſe, how oftenſoever repeated, it is impoſſible to read the life and death of our bleſſed Saviour, without renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and increaſing in our hearts, that love and reverence, and gratitude towards him, which is ſo juſtly due for all he did and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. EVERY word that fell from his lips is more precious than all the treaſures of the earth; for his
<q>are the words of eternal life.</q>
They muſt therefore be laid up in your heart, and conſtantly referred to on all occaſions, as the rule and direction of all your actions; particularly thoſe very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive moral precepts he has graciouſly left with us, which can never fail to direct us right, if fairly and honeſtly applied; ſuch as, "whatſoever you would that men ſhould do unto you, even ſo do unto them." There is no occaſion, great or ſmall, on which you may not ſafely apply this rule for the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your conduct; and whilſt your heart honeſtly adheres to it, you can never be guilty of any ſort of injuſtice or unkindneſs.</p>

                  <pb n="191" facs="unknown:023387_0193_0FBF68F38C0F0940"/>3. THE two great commandments which contain the ſummary of our duty to God and man, are no leſs eaſily retained, and made a ſtandard by which to judge our own hearts,
<q>to love the Lord our God, with all our hearts, with all our minds, with all our ſtrength; and our neighbour (or <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <q>Love worketh no ill to his neighbour.</q>
Therefore, if you have true benevolence, you will never do any thing injurious to individuals or to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
               <p n="4">4. NOW, all crimes whatſoever are (in their remoter conſequences, at leaſt if not immediately and apparently) injurious to the ſociety in which we live. It is impoſſible to love God, without deſiring to pleaſe him, and as far as we are able, to reſemble him; therefore, the love of God muſt lead to every virtue in the higheſt degree; and we may be ſure, we do not truly love him, if we content ourſelves with avoiding fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant ſins, and do not ſtrive in good earneſt to reach the greateſt degree of perfection we are capable of. Thus do thoſe few words direct us to the higheſt chriſtian virtue.

He has left you ſuch declarations of his will, and of the conſequences of your actions, as you are, even now, fully able to underſtand, if you will but attend to them. If then you will imitate his zeal for knowledge, if you will delight in gaining information and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you may even now become wiſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation."</p>
               <p n="2">2. UNMOVED by the praiſe he acquired amongſt thoſe learned men, you ſee him meekly return to the ſubmiſſion of a child under thoſe who appeared to be his parents,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:023387_0195_0FBF68F6E146D450"/>
though he was in reality their Lord: you ſee him return to live with them, to work for them, and to be the joy and ſolace of their lives; until the time came, when he was to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the ſcene of public action, for his heavenly father had ſent him from his own right hand, to take upon him the form of a poor carpenter's ſon.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

                  </gap>hat an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample does he give us, of the moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and conſtant benevolence. How are all his hours ſpent in doing good to the ſouls of men.

               <p n="4">4. WHEN you come to read of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and death, the ignominy and reproach, the ſorrow of mind, and torment of body,

No power of language can make the ſcene more touching than it appears in the plain and ſimple narrations of the Evengeliſts— The heart that is unmoved by it, can be ſcarcely human; but the emotions of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and compunction, which almoſt every one feels in reading this account, will be of no avail, unleſs applied to the true end; unleſs it inſpires you with a ſincere and warm affection towards your bleſſed Lord; with a firm reſolution to obey his commands; to be his faithful diſciple, and ever to renounce and abhor thoſe ſins which brought man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind under divine condemnation, and from which we have been redeemed at ſo dear a rate.</p>
               <p n="5">5. REMEMBER that the ſtile of chriſtian, or follower of Chriſt, implies a more than ordinary degree of holineſs and goodneſs.— As our motives to virtue are ſtronger than thoſe which are afforded to the reſt of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, our guilt will be poportionably greater, if we depart from it.</p>

EXCELLENT is the advice which the Apoſtle gives to both parties: he exhorts the Jewiſh converts not to judge, and the Gentiles not to deſpiſe; remembering, that the kingdom of heaven is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt—Endeavor to conform yourſelf to this advice, to acquire a temper of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal candor and benevolence; and learn neither to deſpiſe nor condemn any perſons on account of their particular modes of faith and worſhip: remembering always, that goodneſs is confined to no party; that there are wiſe and worthy men among all the ſects of chriſtians; and that to his maſter, every one muſt ſtand or fall.</p>

               <head>THE EPISTLE OF ST. JAMES.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE Epiſtle of St. James is entirely practical, and exceedingly fine; you cannot ſtudy it too much. It ſeems particularly deſigned to guard chriſtians againſt miſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſome things in St. Paul's writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which have been fatally perverted to the encouragement of a dependence on faith alone, without good works. But the more rational commentators will tell you, that by the works of the law, which the Apoſtle aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts to be incapable of juſtifying us, he means not the works of moral righteouſneſs, but the ceremonial works of the Moſaic law, on which the Jews laid the greateſt ſtreſs as neceſſary to ſalvation. But St. James tells us, that "if any man among us ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, that man's religion
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:023387_0206_0FBF645B5CB2B1E8"/>
is vain;" and that "pure religion, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defiled before God and the Father, is this, to viſit the fatherleſs and widow in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, and to keep himſelf unſpotted from the world." Faith in Chriſt, if it produce not theſe effects, he declareth is dead, or of no power.</p>

one's power to baniſh all uneaſy thought, and to fill up the hours of life with perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al amuſement; life ſo filled up would, upon reflection, appear poor and trivial. But theſe are far from being the terms upon which man is brought into this world.</p>
               <p n="3">3.

For a fretful and diſcontented temper renders one incapable of performing aright any part in life.

Viewing yourſelves with all your imperfections and failings in a juſt light, you will rather be ſurpriſed at your enjoying ſo many good things, than

At the ſame time, the chearfulneſs belonging to virtue, is to be carefully diſtinguiſhed from that light and giddy temper which characte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes folly, and is ſo often found among the diſſipated and vicious part of mankind.— Their gaity is owing to a total want of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection; and brings with it the uſual conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of an unthinking habit, ſhame, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe, and heavineſs of heart in the end.</p>

With leſs external ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty it was attended, but is, on that account, the more wonderful, that, under an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ſo ſimple, ſuch great events were covered.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IN the hours of Chriſt's death, the long ſeries of prophecies, viſions, types, and figures, was accompliſhed. This was the center in which they all met; this the point towards which they had tended and verged, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the courſe of ſo many generations. You behold the law and the prophets ſtanding, if we may ſo ſpeak, at the foot of the croſs, and doing homage. You behold Moſes and Aaron bearing the ark of the covenant; David and Elijah preſenting the oracle of teſtimony. You behold all the prieſts and ſacrifices, all the rites and ordinances, all
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:023387_0216_0FBF647626BAFA60"/>
the types and ſymbols, aſſembled together to receive their conſummation. Without the death of Chriſt, the worſhip and cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the law would have remained a pompous, but unmeaning inſtitution. In the hour when he was crucified, "the book of the ſeven ſeals" was opened. Every rite aſſumed its ſignificancy; every prediction met its event; every ſymbol diſplayed its correſpondence.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THIS was the hour of the abolition of the law, and the introduction of the goſpel; the hour of terminating the old, and begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the new diſpenſation of religious know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and worſhip throughout the earth.— Viewed in this light, it forms the moſt auguſt aera, which is found in the hiſtory of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p n="4">4. WHEN Chriſt was ſuffering on the croſs, we are informed by one of the Evangeliſts, that he ſaid, I thirſt; and they filled a ſpunge with vinegar and put it to his mouth. "Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had taſted the vinegar, knowing that all things were now accompliſhed, and the ſcripture fulfilled, he ſaid, it is finiſhed;" that is, this offered draught of vinegar was the laſt circumſtance predicted by an ancient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet that remained to be fulfilled. The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and the prophecy are now ſealed: the Moſaic diſpenſation is cloſed. "And he bowed his head and gave up the Ghoſt."—
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:023387_0217_0FBF6479D489E388"/>
Significantly was the veil of the temple rent in this hour; for the glory then departed from between the Cherubims. The legal high prieſt delivered up his urim and thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim, his breaſt plate, his robes, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe; and Chriſt ſtood forth as the great high-prieſt of all ſucceeding generations. By that one ſacrifice, which he now offered, he aboliſhed ſacrifices for ever. Altars on which the fire had blazed, for ages, were now to ſmoke no more. Victims were no more to bleed. "Not with the blood of bulls and goats, but with his own blood; he now enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the holy place, there to appear in the preſence of God for us."</p>
               <p n="5">5. THIS was the hour of aſſociation and union to all the worſhippers of God. When Chriſt ſaid, "it is finiſhed," he threw down the wall of partition which had ſo long di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the Gentile from the Jew. He gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into one all the faithful out of every kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and people. He proclaimed the hour to be come, when the knowledge of the true God ſhould be no longer confined to one nation, nor his worſhip to one temple; but over all the earth, the worſhippers of the father ſhould "ſerve him in ſpirit and in truth." From that hour, they who dwelt in the "utmoſt ends of the earth, ſtrangers to the covenant of promiſe, began to be "brought nigh." In that hour the light of
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:023387_0218_0FBF647CAE50C7F0"/>
the goſpel dawned from a far on the Britiſh iſlands.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THIS was the hour of Chriſt's triumph over all the powers of darkneſs; the hour in which he overthrew dominions, and thrones, "led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men." The conteſt which the kingdom of darkneſs had long maintained againſt the kingdom of light, was now brought to its criſis. The period was come, when "the ſeed of the woman ſhould bruiſe the head of the ſerpent." For many ages the moſt groſs ſuperſtition had filled the earth.— "The glory of the incorruptible God was" every where, except in the land of Judea, "changed into images made like to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible man, and to birds and beaſts, and creeping things." The world, which the Almighty created for himſelf, ſeemed to have become a temple of idols. Even to vices and paſſions altars were raiſed; and, what was entitled religion, was, in effect, a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of impurity. In the midſt of this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal darkneſs, Satan had erected his throne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> ſavage nations, bowed down before him.— But at the hour when Chriſt appeared on the croſs, the ſignal of his defeat was given.— His kingdom ſuddenly departed from him; the reign of idolatry paſſed away—He was beheld to fall like lightning from heaven."
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:023387_0219_0FBF6480A84D5260"/>
In that hour the foundation of every Pagan temple ſhook; the ſtatue of every falſe God tottered on its baſe. The prieſt fled from his falling ſhrine; and the Heathen oracles became dumb for ever.</p>
               <p n="7">7. DEATH alſo, the laſt foe of man, was the victim of this hour. The formidable appearance of the ſpectre remained, but his dart was taken away; for, in the hour when Chriſt expiated guilt, he diſarmed death, by ſecuring the reſurrection of the juſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>— When he ſaid to his penitent fellow-ſufferer, "To day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe," He announced to all his followers the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heavenly bliſs. He declared,
<q>The Cherubims</q>
to be diſmiſſed, and the
<q>fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſword</q>
to be ſheathed, which had been appointed at the fall,
<q>to keep from man the way of the Tree of Life.</q>
Faint before this period, had been the hope, and indiſtinct the proſpect, which even good men enjoyed of the heavenly kingdom.
<q>Life and immortality were now brought to light.</q>
From the hill of Calvary, the firſt clear view was given to the world of the everlaſting manſions. Since that hour, they have been the perpetual conſolation of believers in Chriſt. Under trouble they ſooth their minds; amidſt temptations they ſupport their virtue; and in their dying moments enable

them to ſay, "O death! where is thy ſting? O grave! where is thy victory?</p>

THAT great prophet Moſes, it is ſaid, was called up, by a voice from heaven, to the top of a mountain; where, in a confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Supreme Being, he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to propoſe to him ſome queſtions concerning his adminiſtration of the univerſe.

At the foot of the mountain there iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out a clear ſpring of water, at which a ſoldier alighted from his horſe to drink.— He was no ſooner gone, than a little boy came to the ſame place, and finding a purſe of gold, which the ſoldier had dropped, took it up and went away with it. Immediately after this came an infirm old man, weary with age and travelling, and having quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his thirſt, ſat down to reſt himſelf by the ſide of the ſpring: the ſoldier, miſſing his purſe, returns to ſearch for it, and demands it of the old man, who affirms that he had not ſeen it; and appeals to heaven in wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his innocence: the ſoldier, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving his proteſtations, kills him.</p>

               <p>Multiplication ſerveth inſtead of ſeveral additions. There are three things particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be obſerved, in this rule; viz. The Multiplicand, or ſum multiplied, the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplier or ſum multiplied by, the product or anſwer. The multiplicand and multiplier, when taken together, are ſometimes called Factors.</p>
               <p>RULE I. Let the factors be placed one under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, taking care to place, units under units, tens under tens, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>RULE II. When the multiplier conſiſts of more places than one, there muſt be made as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſeveral products as there are figures in the multiplier: let the firſt figure of every product ſtand directly under the multiplying
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:023387_0231_0FBF64A56667E8C0"/>
figure: add theſe ſeveral products together, and their ſum will be the total product.</p>
               <p>RULE III. Cyphers at the right of either, or both factors, may be omitted in the operation, but muſt be annexed to the product.</p>
               <p>RULE IV. When the multiplier is any compoſite number (as 6 times 6 is 36) multiply by thoſe parts one after another, and the laſt product will be the total product ſought.
