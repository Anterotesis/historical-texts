            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SUCH is the conciſe, nervous and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding Style in which the Apoſtle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forces thoſe two important Duties. He connects the reſpectful Honour and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience we owe to our Sovereign, with that filial, reverential Fear which is due to our Creator; not only becauſe they are characteriſtic of a real Chriſtian, and ſhould be inſeparable; but becauſe our Welfare, Peace and Happineſs, temporal and eternal, depend on the Diſcharge of them.</p>
            <p>IT is worthy of Obſervation, that theſe Duties are often joined together in other Paſſages of ſacred Writ, in the Old as well as New-Teſtament.</p>
            <p>THUS Solomon exhorts,— <q>My Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change.</q> And he immediately ſubjoins a weighty Reaſon for the Exhortation. <q>For, ſays he, their Calamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly; and who knoweth the Ruin of them both <note n="¶" place="bottom">Prov. xxiv. 21, 22.</note>?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:016810_0004_0F9E7EDA035EE270"/>WHEN an Opportunity of ſpeaking on thoſe two Points was occaſionally preſented to our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour, he alſo joined them together— <q>Render unto Caeſar, ſays he, the Things which are Caeſar's; and unto God, the Things that are God's <note n="§" place="bottom">Matth. xxii. 21. Mark xii. 17. Luke xx. 25.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS ſerves to point out the cloſe Connection between thoſe Duties; it alſo places our Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to, "Honour the King," in a ſtriking Light, however it may be diſregarded by ſome People. Duties which God hath thus united and joined together, no Man ſhould ever preſume to put aſunder.</p>
            <p>THE tragical Event which we are enjoined by our Church to commemorate this Day, naturally ſuggeſts the Conſideration of this Subject— particularly the latter Part of it, honouring the King. A Failure in this Duty did once involve our Nation in all the Horrors of Rebellion and Civil War. To ſuch Lengths did the Phrenzy of Enthuſiaſm, and Republican Ambition puſh on the Sons of Rebellion at that Period, that they imbrued their Hands in the Blood of their moſt excellent Sovereign; thereby intailing Guilt on our Nation, and ſtaining our Hiſtory with indelible Infamy.</p>
            <p>TO raiſe a juſt Abhorrence for ſuch atrocious Crimes—to preſerve in our Minds a proper Senſe of the Honour due to our Sovereign, by which the Bleſſings of Harmony and Peace are ſecured— to deprecate the Divine Diſpleaſure for the Guilt then contracted, and that God would be pleaſed
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016810_0005_0F9ECCA6D6D8D4C8"/>
to avert ſimilar Guilt and Calamities for the future: For theſe great Purpoſes, our Church hath wiſely and piouſly ſet apart this Day, as a Day of public Humiliation and Prayer; and hath appointed the excellent Office, which you have now heard, to be annually uſed on the Occaſion.</p>
            <p>EXPERIENCE ſhews that too much Caution can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uſed in guarding againſt ſuch Evils. The Wiſdom of Man perhaps could not deviſe any Thing more effectual to prevent them, than the Inſtitution I have mentioned. If notwithſtanding, a Rebellion of the ſame Kind now afflicts this Country, we ſhould not infer that this Inſtitution is uſeleſs, or ſhould be laid aſide; but juſt the Reverſe. We ſhould be the more punctual in obſerving it; as this hath a Tendency to counteract the Spirit which produces ſuch Diſaſters; and, certain it is, that the Deſpiſers, not the conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Obſervers of this Inſtitution, were the Authors of our preſent Calamities.</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the Care that is taken to inculcate Principles of Virtue and Religion among Mankind, yet much Vice and Impiety prevail in the World. Would not theſe be ſtill more preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, were that Care to be relaxed, or thrown aſide?</p>
            <p>TO fear God, is one of the firſt and greateſt Duties of his rational Creatures. This Fear ariſes from a juſt Conception of His Being, Atributes, Perfections and Preſence. It is mingled with Love, and reſembles the Fear of a dutiful, affectionate Child towards a tender Father. It is the Begining
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016810_0006_0F9E7EDB01122B80"/>
of Wiſdom <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. ix. 10.</note>; and when habitually fixed in the Soul, is the Foundation of true Religion—the Parent of every Virtue.</p>
            <p>TO honour the King, is another Duty of great Conſequence, connected with, and flowing from, the former. Permit me, as this Day requires, to enlarge upon the latter —to explain briefly what is implied in the Precept—"Honour the King;" and then to ſhew the Reaſons on which the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of this Duty is founded. There are few who will not acknowledge that the Conſideration of this Subject is proper in theſe unhappy Times.</p>
            <p n="1">I. ST. PETER wrote this Epiſtle from Rome <note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>That St. Peter was at Rome, and ſuffered Martyrdom in that City, are Facts which are ſupported by the unanimous, uncontra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted Teſtimony of Chriſtian Writers of the <hi>five</hi> firſt Centuries. This hath been clearly ſhewn by Biſhop PEARSON, and Dr. CAVE, in Anſwer to ſome who, from a falſe Zeal againſt Popery, ſeemed to queſtion whether that Apoſtle ever was at Rome: As if the Antichriſtian Errors and Uſurpations of Popery could not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently refuted, from Scripture and the primitive Writers, without denying ſo well atteſted a Fact, on Principles that would ſubvert all ancient Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>That St. Peter wrote this Epiſtle from Rome, which he figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively calls <hi>Babylon,</hi> Chap. v. 13. hath alſo the general Suffrage of Antiquity. This Opinion is accordingly adopted by the beſt modern Commentators, not only among Proteſtants, as GROTIUS, HAM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MOND, WHITBY, &amp;c. but even by Writers of the Church of Rome in general. Rome was figuratively called Babylon on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Reſemblance between thoſe Cities in their Greatneſs, their Idolatries, their Oppoſition to the true Church of God, and in their final Doom. This whole Subject hath been examined with great Accuracy by Dr. LARDNER very lately, whom I therefore mention: He thinks that St. Peter wrote this Epiſtle from Rome, about the Year 64. CREDIB. GOSP. HIST. Vol. xv. Chap. 18, 19.</p>
               </note>. He addreſſed it to all thoſe who were converted to Chriſtianity, and diſperſed through the ſeveral Aſiatic Provinces mentioned in the Beginning of the Epiſtle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:016810_0007_0F9E7EDBDBFB1DD0"/>THE fatal Period was now approaching, when the Jewiſh Nation, abandoned by Heaven, were to feel the heavy Judgments that had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt them by the Son of God, whom they crucified. They were caſt off, and no longer the peculiar People of God. Their general Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct raiſed the Averſion of Mankind againſt them. They were perſecuting and uncharitable towards others; whilſt rent by the bittereſt Animoſities among themſelves. They were ſeditious alſo, frequently raiſing Inſurrections, diſſolving the Obligations between the Prince and the Subject, and making Religion the Cloak of Diſloyalty.</p>
            <p>HITHERTO, Chriſtians were conſidered by the Gentiles as only a Sect of the Jews; and the Crimes of the latter were, through Ignorance or Malice, imputed to the former. Hence there was a Neceſſity, that the Apoſtle ſhould exhort Chriſtians to diſtinguiſh themſelves by thoſe Virtues which were oppoſite to the Vices ſo frequently practiſed by the Jews—to convince the World that they were different People, guided by different Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; that ſo their Lives might bear the ſtricteſt Scrutiny, and turn the Detraction of their Enemies into Praiſe.</p>
            <p>THIS will ſerve to explain the Verſes immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately preceding my Text, which are highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of our Attention. <q>Dearly beloved, ſays the Apoſtle, I beſeech you as Strangers and Pilgrims, abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, which war againſt the Soul, having your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion honeſt among the Gentiles: That whereas they ſpeak againſt you as evil Doers, they may by your good Works which they ſhall

behold, glorify God in the Day of Viſitation. Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit yourſelves to every Ordinance of Man <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Every Ordinance of Man,</hi>—The Words in the Original are, <hi>PASE ANTHROOPINE KTISEI,</hi> i. e. <hi>to every human Creature</hi>; and ſo the Vulgate, and moſt of the ancient Verſions properly tranſlate it. <q>How they came to be rendered, <hi>to every Ordinance of Man,</hi> I profeſs myſelf not to underſtand,</q> ſays Biſhop SHERLOCK, Vol. iv. <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> xiii. Nor can I account for it otherwiſe than by ſaying that the Tranſlators, influenced by the Authority of BEZA, who thus renders it, have in this, as in ſome other Inſtances, adopted his Peculiarities. The Apoſtle in theſe Words evidently lays down a general Propoſition, recommending a meek, ſubmiſſive Behaviour towards all Men, as characteriſtic of the Chriſtian Religion. He then proceeds to Particulars, ſpecifying thoſe to whom this Behoviour ſhould in a peculiar Manner be ſhewn, firſt to the King or Emperor, next, to his Governors, &amp;c.</note>, for the Lord's Sake, whether it be to the King as Supreme, or unto Governors, as unto them that are ſent by him for the Puniſhment of evil Doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do well. For ſo is the Will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to Silence the Ignorance of fooliſh Men. As free, and not uſing your Liberty for a Cloak of Maliciouſneſs, but as the Servants of God. Honour all Men; love the Brother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: Fear God. Honour the King.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HERE, Purity of Life, Charity, mutual Love and Submiſſion to Government, <q>for the Lord's Sake,</q> being the expreſs "Will of God," are earneſtly urged by the Apoſtle; juſt as they are elſewhere urged by ST. PAUL <note n="¶" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 1—7.</note>, for ſimilar Reaſons. By theſe, Chriſtians were to diſtinguiſh themſelves from others, and manifeſt the native Excellence and Spirit of their Religion. The Honour of Chriſt, and the Succeſs of his Goſpel, depended on its Profeſſors obſerving this Line of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct—I
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016810_0009_0F9E7EDD1F505798"/>
may affirm, that they alſo greatly depend on it even now.</p>
            <p>NERO was Emperor of Rome when St. Peter wrote this Catholic Epiſtle; and notwithſtanding the vicious Character of that Prince, he delivers the Precept in my Text— "honour the King." This was to be a general Rule for all Chriſtians. The perſonal Character of the Magiſtrate was not to interfere with the Civil Duty of the Subject: Even when bad, it did not diſſolve the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the latter —were the contrary principle admitted, it muſt neceſſarily and daily fill the World with Confuſion and Diſorder. The Chriſtian therefore, is here injoined to honour the Perſon who is veſted with legal Authority, and whom the Providence of God hath placed over him.</p>
            <p>TO comprehend the Wiſdom of this Injunction the better, and explain the Duty before us, it ſhould be conſidered, that Government is the only Means by which human Happineſs can be attained.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the Diſpoſition of Providence, and the Condition of our Nature, we are born in a State of Society. Without Society, Mankind could not exiſt—the whole Race muſt inevitably be extinguiſhed. But Society cannot ſubſiſt without Government. It is the Band which unites the Intereſts of Individuals; it ſecures to them their reſpective Rights, and preſerves them from Injuries; it is the Source of numberleſs Bleſſings, which are interrupted, or wholly vaniſh, the Moment it is diſturbed. In a Word, whatever
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016810_0010_0F9E7EDDE0BE08C8"/>
Portion of Happineſs is allotted by Providence to the Children of Men, is attainable only through the Means of Government. And as our benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Creator undoubtedly willed the Happineſs of his Creatures, he muſt have willed the Means alſo without which that Happineſs could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.

It is "the Ordinance of God, ordained by him" to miniſter to our Good.<note n="†" place="bottom">Rom. xiii. 1, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

            <p>GOVERNMENT implies Subordination. Where Government is, there muſt be ſome who preſide or govern—and others, over whom that preſidency is exerciſed: From the very Nature and Deſign of Government, it is the Duty of the latter to honour and obey the former. This is alſo the "Will of God"; and hence, the Precept in my Text,— "honour the King."</p>
            <p>TO honour the King, is to entertain reſpectful Sentiments of his Authority and Perſon—to ſpeak always with Deference of both—to promote the Peace and Stability of his Reign, and pay a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Obedience to his Laws—to check, as far as we are able, the Calumnies which Sedition or Malice would propagate to his Diſadvantage, to oppoſe the Proceedings which would diſturb or endanger his Authority—and to promote theſe Sentiments and this Conduct among others.</p>
            <p>THIS Duty implies that we ſhould affectionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſt ourſelves in whatever concerns the Honour, the Fame and Security of our Sovereign
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016810_0011_0F9E7EDEAB45D5C8"/>
and his Government. Theſe we ſhould aſſert, and generouſly defend againſt all Attempts to injure them; whether thoſe of avowed Enemies—or of ſuch as with equally malignant Deſigns, though under plauſible Pretences, would deſtroy and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them.</p>
            <p>OUR fervent Prayers ſhould aſcend to the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty for the Preſervation and Proſperity of our Sovereign. This is expreſsly enjoined by the Word of God <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Timoth. ii, 1, 2, 3.</note>; and is a Part of the Duty we are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering. We ſhould devoutly pray, that He, <q>by whom Kings reign, and Princes decree Juſtice,<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. viii. 15.</note>
               </q> would bleſs the King, direct his Counſels, grant him a long and happy Reign, crown his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings with Succeſs, and make him inſtrumental in promoting the Glory of God, the Intereſts of true Religion and Virtue, and the Welfare, Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Happineſs of his People; and finally, that He would confer on him Immortality and Glory in the Life to come.</p>
            <p>IF we honour the King, according to the Spirit of my Text, we ſhall be ſincerely diſpoſed, and ſhall actually exert ourſelves, to do each of theſe.</p>
            <p>IT may be proper to obſerve further, that this Duty is not confined to thoſe who live under any one particular Form of Government: It extends to the Subjects of all regular States, lawfully eſtabliſhed. That ſome Forms of Government are preferable to others, cannot be doubted; yet neither our Saviour, nor his Apoſtles have decided where that Preference is due. This was foreign to their Deſign. They interfered not with the Civil
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016810_0012_0F9E7EDF60E8CA18"/>
Rights of Individuals, nor with the Political Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of States; but laid down the general Duty of Subjects, who are to <q>render to Caeſar the Things that are Caeſar's,</q>—<q>be ſubject to the higher Powers,</q> and honour thoſe who are veſted with ſupreme Authority; whether that Authority be lodged in One, in a Few, or in Many.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the Nature of the important Duty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us. It would be eaſy to enlarge on each of thoſe Particulars. But I ſhall only add, that the Duty here enjoined by the Expreſſion, <q>honour the King,</q> is in our Language and Law, ſignified by the Word <hi>Allegiance.</hi> All the King's Subjects are bound to Allegiance, before, or even without, any Oath for that Purpoſe. Oaths, Fealty and Homage were only inſtituted to remind the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his previous Duty, in certain Caſes, and inſure the better Performance of it. They are no more than Declarations of what was implied be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and of that to which the Subject was indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly bound, from the very Nature of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Reaſon of Things.</p>
            <p>INDEED, if the Oath of Allegiance be broken by violating the Duty to which it obligeth, it aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates a Man's Guilt, by adding Perjury to Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. <q>But it does not increaſe the Civil Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Loyalty; it only ſtrengthens the ſocial Tie by uniting it with that of Religion.<note n="†" place="bottom">I Blackſtone, B. I. Chap. 10.</note>
               </q> This may ſerve to expoſe the Deluſion of ſome, who imagine they are under little or no Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Loyalty, or "to honour the King," becauſe they have not taken the Oath of Allegiance.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:016810_0013_0F9E7EE01E4826C8"/>II. I now proceed to ſhew the Reaſons on which the Diſcharge of this Duty is founded.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE have the expreſs Commands of God, of his inſpired Prophets and Apoſtles for diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this Duty. We ſhould certainly be punctual in the Obſervation of a Duty which is ſo often and ſo earneſtly enjoined by the Authority of Heaven. When it is "the Will of God," and required of us for "the Lord's Sake," we ſhould conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly practiſe it.</p>
            <p>CAN any Authority be greater than that of the Almighty? Or ſhould any of his Precepts be lightly regarded? Do they not all claim our ready and ſubmiſſive Obedience? And can any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be more peremptory or poſitive than that for honouring the King? How then can any who call themſelves Chriſtians diſregard this Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; or think that Conſcience is not concerned in obeying it?</p>
            <p>ONE of the ſore Evils which for ſome Time hath infeſted our Nation, and doth infeſt it now perhaps more than ever, is, to reſolve this, and every other Duty, however ſacred, into what is called political Obligation; which Obligation is generally meaſured by People's <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and will readily give Way to the Caprice, Diſcontent, Ambition, Intereſt, Pride, and other irregular Paſſions of Individuals.</p>
            <p>IF thoſe Men who falſly aſſert, that all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a State Engine—the Invention of Politicians to keep the Multitude in Subjection and Order— if theſe ſhould alſo aſſert, that the Duty of Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016810_0014_0F9E7EE123A8A1B0"/>
honouring the King, hangs on the ſlender Thread of Political Obligation only, and that it is a Matter with which God and Conſcience have nothing to do; it need not occaſion any Surprize.</p>
            <p>BUT that profeſſing Chriſtians, who really be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in a divine Revelation, and acknowledge its Authority—that theſe ſhould be the Dupes of ſuch Men—that they ſhould make no Conſcience of diſhonouring their King, and rebelling againſt him—that they ſhould knowingly trample on the Law of God, and act as if no ſuch Law exiſted— that inſtead of obeying this Law, they ſhould be Trumpeters of Sedition and Rebellion: This is aſtoniſhing indeed! Did not melancholly Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence convince us of its Truth, we ſhould think it impoſſible that any who profeſs Chriſtianity, could purſue a Conduct ſo diametrically oppoſite to the Spirit of their Religion!</p>
            <p>HOW different was the Conduct of primitive Chriſtians, who exemplified in their Lives the Precepts of their Maſter; who ſtudied to obey his Will; and whoſe Innocence, Patience and Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude finally triumphed over all the Oppoſition of Heathen Error and Idolatry! In nothing were they more diſtinguiſhed than in Submiſſion to their Civil Rulers, and punctual Obſervation of their Laws, where thoſe Laws did not contradict the expreſs Will of God; as in the Caſe of ſacrificing to Idols, renouncing their Saviour, ſwearing by Daemons, by the Genius of Caeſar, and the like.</p>
            <p>OUR bleſſed Lord commanded his Followers to love their Enemies, and pray for their Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors—to render to Caeſar the Things that are Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar's.

His Apoſtles unanimouſly inculcated Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and Obedience to the higher Powers.</p>
            <p>THOSE Chriſtians juſtly conſidered theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts to be equally obligatory with any others in the New Teſtament; and accordingly, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to them as conſcienciouſly as to any others.

            <p>SUCH were the Principles and Practice of primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians with Reſpect to the Duty they owed to Rulers; both are faithfully repreſented in this Extract, which I have therefore made the longer. They were Strangers to that Sort of Caſuiſtry which diſpenſes with the Word of God requiring Honour and Subjection to the higher Powers; diſſolves the Tie of Civil Obedience, though confirmed by a ſolemn Oath; releaſes Conſcience from the Obligation of all theſe, and then abſolves from the Guilt of ſuch Crimes, when Subjects, either through Ambition, Prejudice, or other ſiniſter Motives, happen to diſlike the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or want to overturn it. They perſevered in the above Principles and Practice for Ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Tertullian's Time, untill a Degeneracy of Manners and Decay of Piety in many, gave Riſe to new Maxims and a different Conduct. Theſe Maxims have been improved upon, and frequently reduced to Practice, in theſe latter Ages; to the unſpeakable Injury of States, and Diſgrace of our holy Religion.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:016810_0018_0F9E7EE894643AE8"/>2. BUT if Men will not regard this Precept from a Principle of Conſcience, and becauſe it is the Will of God; yet at leaſt for their own Sake they ſhould do ſo: For on a due Obſervation of it, the Stability of Government and the Peace of Societies depend; and in theſe, it may be affirmed, the Happineſs of Individuals is involved. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably is the Caſe in our Government, where all are under the Protection of equal Laws; and no Subject can labour under any Grievance for which the Law and Conſtitution have not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Remedy.</p>
            <p>TO honour the King therefore, is not only the Duty which God requires and Reaſon approves; but it is a Duty, by the Diſcharge of which we contribute to the Happineſs of all our Fellow Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: For hereby we ſupport the Conſtitution and Government which ſecure to them that Happineſs.</p>
            <p>THE Welfare of Society ſhould be a leading Principle of our Conduct. Reaſon and Human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity oblige us to wiſh that Peace ſhould be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, and its Bleſſings be widely diffuſed—that Religion, Juſtice and Righteouſneſs ſhould flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh—that public Proſperity and private Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould prevail—that thoſe Benefits which help to ſweeten Life, and alievate the Sufferings of this Scene of Tryal, ſhould abound. Who will deny this? Is it not ſelf evident? Can thoſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Benefits be otherwiſe enjoyed than under a regular Government? And does not the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of this Precept tend as much to confirm,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016810_0019_0F9E7EE9208AB040"/>
as the Neglect of it to ſubvert, regular Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>
            <p>WHAT other Security have we for thoſe Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits; or againſt Oppreſſion, Injuſtice, Violence and Wickedneſs, than that of Government? It is evidently the Ordinance of God—the Remedy which his Providence hath appointed againſt the numberleſs Evils of Anarchy. Remove that Barrier, and every Species of Iniquity would rage and reign without Controul. The Weak would fall a Prey to the Strong—the Innocent to the Guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—the Meek and Humble to the Deſigning and Ambitious.</p>
            <p>BUT Government cannot be carried on ſo as to avert theſe Evils, unleſs thoſe who rule, are hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured and obeyed. The Obedience of Subjects, flowing from a Principle of Conſcience, and Honour to the Sovereign, is the active Spring by which Government is moved and exerted. Take away that Spring, and the whole Machine is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered: it muſt ſtand ſtill; and all the Evils of Anarchy and Miſrule would enſue.</p>
            <p>FOR although the Offence, not honouring the King, may ſeem to be perſonal, and directed againſt the Prince only; yet it reſts not there. It virtually extends to the whole Community, and affects every Member of it; not only by inſulting each of them in the Perſon of their Sovereign; but by weakening the Energy of Government, which prepares the Way for all thoſe Diſorders to ruſh in.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:016810_0020_0F9E7EE9DAC1F5D8"/>3. AND this ſuggeſts another Motive or Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for diſcharging this Duty; namely, That the greateſt Evils which can befall Society, neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily attend the Neglect or Breach of it. So that if even the Authority of God were ſet aſide in this Caſe; the Principles of Humanity, Reaſon and found Policy would decide in Favour of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept—"honour the King."</p>
            <p>MORE human Blood hath been ſhed—greater Miſeries and Calamities have been entailed on Mankind—and more audacious Impieties and Enormities of every Kind have been committed by Means of Sedition and Rebellion, than perhaps through any other Cauſe whatever.</p>
            <p>IF Men once deviate from the obvious Path of their Duty, there is no telling where they will ſtop. Perhaps they apprehend no great Danger at firſt, and foreſee not all the Conſequences of their Procedure. Having ſubdued the firſt Struggles of Conſcience, it afterwards becomes more pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant; and they are gradually carried on from one Step to another, till they find themſelves in a Situation, that is extremely difficult and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous. Thus have the moſt aggravated Evils ariſen from ſeemingly ſmall Beginnings, which occaſioned little Alarm: And this is often the Caſe of Rebellion—it proceeds moſtly from a neglect of the Precept before us, "Honour the King." Many conſider this Neglect as a very trifling of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; but how pernicious has it frequently prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in its Effects to Mankind!</p>
            <p>WHEN diſreſpectful Sentiments of the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign are entertained, contrary to this Command, it
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016810_0021_0F9E7EEAC0784CE0"/>
leads to diſreſpectful and ſeditious Language; and the Tranſition is eaſy and natural from the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage to the Practice of Sedition. He that freely indulges himſelf in that Language, wants only an Opportunity to realize, and reduce it to Practice.</p>
            <p>Now reflect for a Moment on the horrid Train of Evils which follow Rebellion. The firſt Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of its Progreſs are carried on by Deceit, Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Perjury. It is dreadful even in its mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Effects. It is ſtained with Blood, and diffuſes general Diſtreſs and Miſery. The Ruin of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions attend it. All the dark, malevolent Paſſions of the Soul are rouſed and exerted; its mild and amiable affections are ſuppreſſed; and with them, virtuous Principles are laid proſtrate. Hence it is that Civil Wars are always more cruel and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous than foreign Wars, and more deſtructive to Morals; In the former, perſonal Revenge and Animoſity mingle, and kindle up the Soul to tenfold Rage. Reckon over the Benefits which Government confers on Mankind; and the Evil which is contrary to each of theſe Benefits, is brought on Mankind by Rebellion. Add to all this, that when ſucceſsful, it generally ends in Tyranny, and the moſt grievous Oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>EACH of theſe Particulars was literally verified in the Rebellion, whoſe Guilt was conſumated by the ſhedding of Royal Blood—by the Martyrdom of King CHARLES I, which we commemorate this Day.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not take up your Time with a minute Detail of the Riſe, Progreſs and Effects of that Rebellion. Suffice it to obſerve, that it began
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016810_0022_0F9E7EEB6125B7C0"/>
with the Breach of St. Peter's Precept—"honour the King." Groundleſs Suſpicions of him were cheriſhed, and the moſt palpable Falſhoods were propagated by deſigning Men. Hereby the Minds of many were poiſoned. Ambition under the uſual Maſk of Patriotiſm, and Enthuſiaſm in the Garb of Religion, blew the Trumpet of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Open Violence ſucceeded, and a bloody, ruinous Rebellion was the Conſequence. The Nation was weakened, its Property deſtroyed and diſſipated, and the Conſtitution was wholly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. The Sovereign was deliberately murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—a Sovereign who was not more diſtinguiſhed by his Sufferings, than by his Fortitude and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity—by unaffected Piety to God, and Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to Mankind. Of this he gave the higheſt Teſtimony that Man is capable of giving—he reſiſted unto Blood, and laid down his Life, rather than betray the Church of God, or the People, committed to his Care by divine Providence.</p>
            <p>WHAT was the Iſſue of all thoſe Crimes, this Waſte of Blood and Treaſure?—The moſt oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, abſolute Tyranny, on the Part of the Uſurper; and a State of the moſt abject Slavery, with Reſpect to the People at large! A State infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely worſe than that which the moſt inflamed Zealot, the moſt violent Republican or Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſt even pretended to dread before the Rebellion commenced.</p>
            <p>NEED I tell you that the unnatural Rebellion which, at this Day, deſolates and diſgraces America, bears the ſtrongeſt Reſemblance to the former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion? The one is an exact Counterpart of the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016810_0023_0F9E7EEC2CE38FD8"/>
other—begun on nearly the ſame Principles, and carried on by the very ſame Methods.</p>
            <p>THE Tranſactions which led to the preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion are recent, and freſh in your Memory. They originated from thoſe who diſhonoured the King, traduced his Government, trampled on his Authority, and imputed to him Deſigns which had not the leaſt Foundation in Truth<note n="†" place="bottom">Beſides perſonal Invectives againſt the King, it was affirmed that a Plan had been formed to enſlave the Colonies—that Popery was to be univerſally eſtabliſhed, to which, the Canada Bill was an Introduction—an Act of Parliament was forged and printed in the News-Papers, in which, among other Extravagancies, the <hi>tenth Child</hi> through all the Colonies was aſſigned to the King or parochial Clergyman, I forget which; and ſuch was the Credulity of People that this Act was believed to be genuine, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note>. Imaginary Dangers were pretended; the Paſſions of the Populace were inflamed to a Degree of Phrenzy; and every Engine was employed to carry on the Work of Sedition. Theſe Methods, managed with great Artifice and Zeal, and each Circumſtance heightened with the bittereſt Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, proved but too ſucceſsful. The Minds of many were poiſoned, and ſeduced from their Duty; and ſeveral well meaning Perſons were prevailed on to join in the deſtructive Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that were afterwards adopted. Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, that Foible of weak Minds tinctured with local Pride, in which however the ambitious Leaders ſought their own Aggrandiſement, though big with certain Ruin to this Country, was declared; and then Rebellion, undiſguiſed and undiſſembled, flouriſhed over us.</p>
            <p>WAS there a happier Country on Earth before that Period, than this? Did it not enjoy all the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016810_0024_0F9E7EECDD5ED450"/>
of Government without its Burdens? Is there on Earth, this Day, a more wretched Country? Where is that Peace, that Eaſe, that Affluence, Security and Freedom which formerly reſided in, and diſtinguiſhed America? They are fled. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, Violence and Uſurpation prevail in their Stead. Diſtreſs and Affliction are univerſally diffuſed. The tendereſt Ties are rent aſunder. Thoſe who ſhould live and love like Brethren, are filled with deadly Animoſity againſt each other: Not only Fellow Subject waring againſt Fellow Subject; but Brother and Brother, Parent and Child ſtand up to ſhed each other's Blood! Thouſands have periſhed by the Sword, and by the Calamities of War—thouſands are driven from their once peaceful Abodes, ſtript of their Property, and expoſed to Miſery and Want, on Account of their Loyalty. The Land is polluted with innocent Blood—with the Blood of thoſe who, from a Principle of Conſcience, adhered to their rightful Sovereign; and rather than renounce Him, or bear Arms againſt Him, have ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Death. Unſatisfied with theſe accumulated Evils, the Leaders of Rebellion would plunge this devoted Country ſtill deeper in Ruin. They have leagued with the Popiſh, inveterate Enemies of our Nation, of our Religion and Liberties— they have virtually, and as far as in them lay, delivered this Country into the Hands of a deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potic Power—a Power which has extinguiſhed Liberty, and extirpated the Proteſtant Religion from all its Dominions; and would, doubtleſs, gladly avail itſelf of the Opportunity, now offered, to exterminate Both in this Country alſo.—But I turn from the Subject with Horror—my Heart will not permit me to enlarge.</p>

            <p>THUS were Matters weighed in the equal Scales of unbyaſſed Reaſon and ſound Policy—were the Conſequences of honouring the King, put into the one Scale, and the Effects of neglecting it, put into the other; it is eaſy to ſee which would preponderate, which would have the Advantage. Prudence, Reaſon and Policy certainly forbid us to run into a greater Evil, that we may avoid a leſs. A wiſe Man will deliberately examine Things, not only in themſelves, but in their Conſequences; and of two Evils, if he is unavoidably obliged to chuſe, he will chuſe the leaſt. Were we to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide on the Principles of mere worldly Prudence, this would be a much better Teſt of Obedience to the Precept in my Text, than <hi>the Feelings of the People,</hi> which hath been abſurdly advanced as a Teſt in this Caſe by ſome: Not reflecting that <hi>the Feelings of the People,</hi> of a great many at leaſt, on ſuch Occaſions, will be exactly ſuch as are excited by Ambition, Diſcontent, falſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, or the artful Management of deſigning Men. But when to all theſe Conſiderations, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Heaven is added, to "honour the King," it is difficult to account how any one who fears God, or loves his Fellow Creatures, can diſregard this Precept.</p>

In doing ſo, we ſhall both act agreeably to the Will of Heaven, and promote the Welfare of Society; for ſuch is the Goodneſs of the Almighty, that in this, as in every other Inſtance, he hath not only made our Duty compatible with our Intereſt and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; but he hath inſeparably connected them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>

At leaſt, they were not ſufficiently prized; or elſe they had not been ſo wantonly flung away. To be a Britiſh Subject, with all its concomitant Advantages, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies more Happineſs, more and greater privileges, than to be the Subject of any other State or Prince on Earth. We ſhould be, and I truſt we are, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this; ſhould we not therefore now act with a Frmneſs and Zeal proportioned to the Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of thoſe Objects? Should it not alſo be our wiſh, that our deluded Brethren may return to that Duty which they once warmly profeſſed? And ſhare with us again in thoſe Bleſſings we once ſweetly enjoyed in common?</p>

            <p>HAPPY for us, that in doing this, we need not deviate from Truth, nor ſacrifice Chriſtian Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to political Duty.

moſt trying Occaſions, you, my Fellow Citizens, <hi>did</hi> honour and faithfully adhere to him.</p>
            <p>YOU have been, and I doubt not, ever will be, loyal to your earthly Sovereign. Let me beſeech you not to tarniſh this Virtue by Diſloyalty or Diſobedience to the Sovereign of Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven—to the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</p>
            <p>WHILST you honour the King, fear God alſo. Theſe Duties ſhould be inſeparable. The one naturally riſes out of the other. He that has formed juſt Conceptions of the Deity, will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with filial Reverence and Fear towards him. The Conſcience of ſuch a Perſon will be tender, and ſhrink at the Thought of violating any of the divine Precepts—eſpecially thoſe which reſpect the Order eſtabliſhed by the Almighty among his rational Creatures; for a Diſregard of theſe cannot fail of diſhonouring the Creator, by an Increaſe of Wickedneſs; nor of injuring Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind by deſtroying the Barriers which Heaven hath fixed to guard their Happineſs.</p>
            <p>THERE is the greateſt Reaſon that we ſhould fear God; not as an arbitrary Tyrant; but as a juſt, powerful and wiſe Governor, whoſe Laws are founded in Righteouſneſs and Truth; who will ſupport the Dignity of his Laws, by puniſhing Tranſgreſſors; and who is privy, not only to our Actions, but to our moſt private Thoughts.</p>
            <p>HIS innate Purity leads him neceſſarily to deteſt Sin. As moral Governor of the Univerſe, placed at the Head of the great intellectual Syſtem, it would be utterly inconſiſtent with that Character,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016810_0029_0F9E7EF69A6DABB8"/>
and with all his Attributes, not to check and puniſh Sin; which might otherwiſe ſubvert his Kingdom, and fruſtrate his Deſigns.</p>
            <p>HENCE the frequent Denunciations in his Word, againſt ſinful Nations; the actual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted on thoſe Nations; nay, their total Overthrow, when they finally abuſed his Mercy, and the Meaſure of their Iniquity was full.</p>
            <p>THIS Procedure was not confined to that Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom he choſe, and were under a particular Diſpenſation. There is the cleareſt Proof of the contrary. The general Rules and Laws of God's Proceedings with the Children of Men, are the ſame and invariable—invariable as his Nature, and the Relation which Men bear to him; for all are equally his Creatures—all are equally capable of Virtue and Vice.</p>
            <p>THE Jews indeed had a peculiar Law and Diſpenſation; and by that Law and Diſpenſation they were judged. The Gentiles were under the Law and Light of Nature, and had traditional In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; by that Law, that Light and Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were alſo judged. The General Rules of the Divine Procedure, as I ſaid before, were the ſame to both; the Mode of Application only varied according to their different Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>THUS we find in Fact that many of the moſt celebrated Heathen Nations, States and Cities which figured in ancient Hiſtory, are the Subjects of Prophecy<note n="†" place="bottom">Beſides thoſe called the four great Empires, viz. The Babyloniſh, Perſian, Grecian and Roman; the Egyptians, Edomites, Moabites, &amp;c. Tyre, Sidon, &amp;c. are the Subjects of divine Prophecy—their Vices are reproved, their Overthrow on Account of thoſe Vices, is predicted.</note>. They were liable to the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidential
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016810_0030_0F9E7EF7743F0BB8"/>
Diſpenſations with the Jews. Judgments were denounced againſt their Vices; and thoſe Judgments were inflicted. Conſult the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies recorded in the Book of God concerning thoſe Nations; then turn to the Hiſtory of thoſe Nations, and you will find the Prophecies concerning them exactly verified.</p>
            <p>HENCE War, Famine, Peſtilence and other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, are expreſsly called the Judgments of God, to execute his Diſpleaſure againſt guilty Nations. Obedient to the divine Command, theſe accordingly ruſh forth, and viſit the Abodes of Sin. They come to chaſten and reclaim, if Men will forſake their Sins, and return to their Duty: Or elſe, to overturn and deſtroy, if they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent, and refuſe to reform.</p>
            <p>WHENEVER therefore we ſee thoſe Judgments abroad, and a People viſited with them, which is our Caſe at preſent; we may be aſſured that the Hand of God is <hi>there,</hi> and that he is calling thoſe People to an Account for their Tranſgreſſions. To "fear God" is the eſpecial Duty of ſuch a People—the Sentiments and Conduct which they ſhould adopt, are pointed out by Hoſea—<q>Come, and let us return unto the Lord; for he hath torn, and he will heal us; he hath ſmitten, and will bind us up<note n="*" place="bottom">Hoſea, vi. 1.</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>TOO many are diverted from their proper Duty on ſuch Occaſions, and fail in making a right Uſe of thoſe Calamities, by attending only to the ſecondary and viſible Cauſes of them. They for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the firſt Spring and Mover, and the Ends for
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:016810_0031_0F9E7EF8293967E0"/>
which Calamities are ſent. Unfruitful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome Seaſons commonly produce Dearth and Mortality; Ambition, Avarice, Reſentment, and the Intrigues of deſigning Men are the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate and general Cauſes of War. In theſe proximate Cauſes, People reſt, without looking further. They do not conſider that Providence always works by ſuch Means, and employs them to effect its Purpoſes; and that the Calamities thus produced, come not the leſs from God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are brought about through thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary Means and Cauſes.</p>
            <p>A FEW Inſtances will elucidate this Point with Reſpect to the Calamities of War, which concern us moſt at preſent.</p>
            <p>THE Aſſyrian, that is Sennacherib, is expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called "the Rod of God's Anger," and was <hi>ſent</hi> againſt the Jews to chaſtiſe them for their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which he accordingly did<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah x. 5.</note>. Cyrus ſurprized and took Babylon<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſaiah xlv.</note>; Alexander of Macedon over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Perſian Monarchy <note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. ii. 39. viii. 5. xi. 3.</note>, as was predicted of each; and the Romans reduced Jeruſalem, and inflicted thoſe heavy Judgments on the Jews which had been denounced againſt them by our Saviour.<note n="**" place="bottom">Matth. xxiv. 15—22,</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE Prophecies concerning thoſe memorable Events undeniably prove that they happened by the Appointment of God: Yet they were brought about by Men who knew not the divine Will, and were actuated ſolely by temporal Motives. What was ſaid of the Aſſyrian, may be affirmed of each—<q>Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:016810_0032_0F9E7EF90C0341A0"/>
doth his Heart think ſo; but it is in his Heart to deſtroy, and cut off Nations not a few.<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah x. 7.</note>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE were the Scourges of God; they were the Inſtruments that executed his Purpoſes; though all Claim to Merit on their Part was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, becauſe they were unconſcious of thoſe Purpoſes; it was not in their Heart to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh them, nor did they mean ſo. They were influenced by Ambition, Pride, Cruelty, and a Thirſt of Conqueſt; and accordingly, were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in their Turn, to the Stroke of divine Juſtice for their Tranſgreſſions.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Excellent are the Reflections of the moſt worthy and learned Biſhop of London, Dr. LOWTH—the Ornament of Religion, Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the preſent Age—on this Subject —<q>God in the Courſe of his Providence, makes Uſe of great Conquerors and Tyrants, as his Inſtruments to execute his Judgments in the Earth; he employs one wicked Nation to ſcourge another. The Inflector of the Puniſhment may perhaps be as culpable as the Sufferer; and may add to his Guilt by indulging his Cruelty in executing God's Juſtice. When he has fulfilled the Work to which the divine Vengeance has ordained him, he will become himſelf the Object of it. God charges the Babylonians, though employed by himſelf to chaſtiſe his People, with Cruelty in Regard to them. They exceeded the Bounds of Juſtice and Humanity in oppreſſing and deſtroying them; and though they were really executing the righteous Decree of God, yet, as far as it regarded themſelves, they were only indulging their own Ambition and Violence.</q> 
                     <hi>Note on</hi> Iſaiah, xlvii. 6.</p>
                  <p>This Note is (among others, replete with Erudition, fine Senſe, and judicious Criticiſm) annexed to his Lordſhip's <hi>New Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Iſaiah into Engliſh,</hi> lately publiſhed-The beſt Tranſlation, beyond Doubt, that has ever been made of that ſublime, evangelical Prophet into any Language. The Lovers of ſacred Literature muſt be equally pleaſed and inſtructed by this Book. The Tranſlation contributes more to remove Difficulties, and elucidate the Prophet's Senſe, than Volumes of Commentaries. We find the elegant Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Original retained; whilſt the Energy, Grandeur and Sublimity by which this Prophet is ſo much diſtinguiſhed, are happily transfuſed into the Tranſlation.</p>
                  <p>The whole Bible, equally well tranſlated and explained (and the right Method for both is here pointed out) would be the moſt valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Acquiſition perhaps to the Church of God, that it has received ſince the Days of Inſpiration. Whoever has read this Book and his Lordſhip's former Work, <hi>De Sacra Poeſi Hebraeorum,</hi> will not heſitate to pronounce him one of the ableſt Critics—probably the very firſt and ableſt in ſacred Literature—that our Nation or any other hath produced. Should any who may honour this Note with a Peruſal, and are yet unacquainted with thoſe excellent Books, be induced to read them, the End for which it is inſerted, will be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</p>
               </note> But hereby the
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:016810_0033_0F9E7EF9F47D87D0"/>
infinite Wiſdom and Power of God are conſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in educing Good out of Evil; making the irregular Paſſions of Men ſubſervient to his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and to the Glory of his Moral Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus not only Idolatrous Heathens, but even Inſects and Vermin, nay, the very Elements, have been delegated by the God of Heaven, to puniſh and reclaim his offending People—to carry his threatened Judgments among guilty Nations.</p>
            <p>I mention theſe Things purely to ſhew, that we ſhould look beyond the immediate Authors of our preſent Calamities. We ſhould raiſe our Thoughts to God, own his Hand, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Juſtice of his Diſpenſations. We ſhould fear him, as the conſtant Witneſs, the righteous Judge of all our Actions—a God of Mercy to thoſe who fear and ſerve him—a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming Fire to obſtinate Tranſgreſſors.</p>
            <p>FEAR, when not directed to its proper Object, is indeed a mean Paſſion. The Almighty is its true Object; and to fear him, is as much our Honour and Wiſdom, as it is our Duty. The Fear of God will guard us againſt the Violation of his Law; it will lead us to Repentance, if we have offended him, and to the conſcienſcious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of each Duty we owe to him and our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Creatures; it will inſpire us with Confidence and firm Truſt in Him, and be a Shield againſt all other Fears and Terrors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:016810_0034_0F9E7EFA71C30768"/>THE Almighty has the ſupream uncontrolled Diſpoſal of all Things. The Actions and Hearts of Men—the Powers of Nature and Events of this World, are entirely in his Hand. He can direct or change, he can repreſs or accelerate them as ſeemeth beſt to his unerring Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>THE Perſon who firmly believes this; and in Conſequence of that Belief, habitually fears God in his Heart, ſincerely ſerving him, and placing his Confidence in him, will feel Conſolation, Hope and Fortitude ſpringing up within him, at the Approach, or under the Preſſure of any Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity. He will not yield to unmanly Fears; but confidently look up to God for Support and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>
            <p>THESE Reflections are very ſuitable to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Situation—and may we profit by them. The Times admoniſh us to examine our Ways, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ourſelves before God, and turn to him with unfeigned Repentance. Proceeding by the ſame Rules which he hath always obſerved towards of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending Nations, his Judgments are gone forth to viſit us for our Abuſe of his Mercies, our Barrenneſs under his Goſpel, and the other numberleſs Tranſgreſſions by which we have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him.</p>
            <p>CONSULT your Conſcience, and then tell me— Should we not hearken to the Voice of God, ſpeaking to us in his Judgments, and calling us to Reformation? Can we look for his Favour or Pardon, if we perſiſt in offending him? Or expect his Bleſſing, if the Cry of our Sins continues to enter his Ears? Would it be right in us to repeat
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:016810_0035_0F9E7EFB359FE7C0"/>
or multiply our Tranſgreſſions, when all that is dear to us, or valuable on Earth, is at Stake in the preſent Conteſt; and when the Iſſue of this Conteſt is ſuſpended on his Will?</p>
            <p>IF any Perſons among us, by their vicious Lives, diſhonour God and provoke him; they are worſe Enemies to us than either Rebels, or their Popiſh Allies. They make the God of Nature our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, who can ſummon the Powers of Nature, and arm every Element, to work our Deſtruction, and defeat our Deſigns. The Efforts and Power of Man may be reſiſted; but who can reſiſt him that is Almighty?</p>
            <p>I TRUST that theſe Conſiderations will ſink deep in our Minds, and produce ſuitable Effects. O let us not remain hardened under the chaſtening Hand of God, nor defeat his gracious Deſigns to reclaim and ſave us. Sincerely lamenting our paſt Sins, which have been committed againſt the cleareſt Light, the deareſt Love, and the moſt tranſcendant Mercy, let us proſtrate ourſelves before God, implore his Pardon, through the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning Merits of his bleſſed Son; and firmly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, by his Grace, to amend hereafter, to fear him, and walk devoutly in his Ways.</p>
            <p>WE ſhould not reſt contented with a cold and barren Aſſent to theſe Things; for this could neither be pleaſing to God, nor profitable to us. We ſhould actually reduce thoſe Truths, thoſe Reſolutions to Practice; and frequently aſk our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Whether the Purpoſes of God have been anſwered by his Viſitation? Whether our evil Habits are weakened or broken—our Sins morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:016810_0036_0F9E7EFC03368668"/>
and forſaken—our Virtues increaſed and ſtrengthened? Whether we are more punctual, more conſcienſcious in the Diſcharge of our Duty to God and Man? Whether we have advanced in Piety and Probity, under our Afflictions, and are become more humble, holy and reſigned? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we <q>deny ourſelves, take up the Croſs dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and follow our divine Maſter</q> with more Ardour? Whether our Hearts be more weaned from the World, from its pleaſureable Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and criminal Purſuits? Whether we are more ſenſible of their Inſufficiency for our Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? And, in fine, whether our Affections are more ſpiritualized, more diſengaged from the faſcinating Blandiſhments of this Life, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in God.?</p>
            <p>QUESTIONS of this Sort, ſeriouſly and repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly urged, would be very beneficial; and I appeal to your Conſcience, whether the Goſpel does not require theſe Particulars of us—whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther each of them is not an eſpecial Duty in our preſent Situation? Evidently, it is by a religious Regard to theſe, and other like Chriſtian Duties, and by this <hi>only,</hi> that we can expect the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty will be reconciled to us; that he will remove our Calamities, call back the Sword from deſtroying, bid Diſcord ceaſe, and command Peace, with its attending Bleſſings, to reviſit us. To ſuch Amendment, his Promiſes of Mercy and Deliverance are explicit, numerous and peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and he will be faithful to thoſe Promiſes. When ſo many powerful Motives conſpire in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending this Line of Conduct, may I not flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter myſelf that you will purſue it?</p>
            <p>
