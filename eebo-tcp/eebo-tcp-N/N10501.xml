            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE attentive gravity, the venerable appearance of this crouded audience, the dignity which I behold in the countenances of ſo many in this great Aſſembly, the ſolemnity of the occaſion upon which we have met together, join'd to a conſideration of the part I am to take in the important buſineſs of this day, fill me with an awe hitherto un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known; and heighten the ſenſe which I have ever had, of my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs to fill this ſacred deſk; but, allur'd by the call of ſome of my reſpected fellow-citizens, with whoſe requeſt it is always my greateſt pleaſure to comply, I almoſt forgot my want of ability to perform what they required. In this ſituation, I find my only ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, in aſſuring myſelf that a generous people will not ſeverely cenſure what they know was well intended, though it's want of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013314_0005_0F8FFB4B9E6572C8"/>
merit, ſhould prevent their being able to applaud it. And I pray, that my ſincere attachment to the intereſt of my country, and hearty deteſtation of every deſign formed againſt her liberties, may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as ſome apology for my appearance in this place.</p>
            <p>I HAVE always from my earlieſt youth, rejoiced in the felicity of my Fellow-men, and have ever conſider'd it as the indiſpenſible duty of every member of ſociety to promote, as far as in him lies, the proſperity of every individual, but more eſpecially of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to which he belongs; and alſo, as a faithful ſubject of the ſtate, to uſe his utmoſt endeavours to detect, and having detected, ſtrenuouſly to oppoſe every traiterous plot which its enemies may deviſe for its deſtruction. Security to the perſons and properties of the governed, is ſo obviouſly the deſign and end of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that to attempt a logical proof of it, would be like burning tapers at noon-day, to aſſiſt the ſun in enlightening the world; and it cannot be either virtuous or honorable, to attempt to ſupport a government, of which this is not the great and principal baſis; and it is to the laſt degree vicious and infamous to attempt to ſupport a government which manifeſtly tends to render the perſons and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties of the governed inſecure. Some boaſt of being <hi>friends to government</hi>; I am a friend to <hi>righteous</hi> government, to a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment founded upon the principles of reaſon and juſtice; but I glory in publickly avowing my eternal enmity to tyranny. Is the preſent ſyſtem which the Britiſh adminiſtration have adopted for the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the colonies, a righteous government? Or is it tyranny?— Here ſuffer me to aſk (and would to Heaven there could be an
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013314_0006_0F8FFB4BDE594980"/>
anſwer) What tenderneſs? What regard, reſpect or conſideration has <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſhewn in their late tranſactions for the ſecurity of the perſons or properties of the inhabitants of the colonies? or rather, What have they omitted doing to deſtroy that ſecurity? They have declared that they have, ever had, and of right ought ever to have, full power to make laws of ſufficient validity to bind the colonies in all caſes whatever: They have exerciſed this pretended right by impoſing a tax upon us without our conſent; and leſt we ſhould ſhew ſome reluctance at parting with our property, her fleets and armies are ſent to inforce their mad pretenſions. The town of Boſton, ever faithful to the Britiſh Crown, has been inveſted by a Britiſh fleet: The troops of George the Third have croſs'd the wide atlantick, not to engage an enemy, but to aſſiſt a band of TRAITORS in trampling on the rights and liberties of his moſt loyal ſubjects in America,—thoſe rights and liberties which as a father he ought ever to regard, and as a King he is bound in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to defend from violations, even at the riſque of his own life.</p>
            <p>LET not the hiſtory of the illuſtrious houſe of Brunſwick inform poſterity, that a King deſcended from that glorious monarch George the ſecond, once ſent his Britiſh ſubjects to conquer and enſlave his ſubjects in America; but be perpetual infamy entail'd upon that villain who dared to adviſe his Maſter to ſuch execrable meaſures; for it was eaſy to foreſee the conſequences which ſo naturally fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon ſending troops into America, to enforce obedience to acts of the Britiſh parliament, which neither God nor man ever empowered them to make. It was reaſonable to expect that troops
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013314_0007_0F8FFB4C8E8B30B8"/>
who knew the errand they were ſent upon, would treat the people whom they were to ſubjugate, with a cruelty and haughtineſs, which too often buries the honorable character of a <hi>ſoldier,</hi> in the diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful name of an <hi>unfeeling ruffian.</hi> The troops upon their firſt arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val took poſſeſſion of our Senate Houſe, and pointed their cannon againſt the Judgment-hall, and even continued them there whilſt the Supreme Court of Judicature for this Province was actually ſitting to decide upon the lives and fortunes of the King's ſubjects.— Our ſtreets nightly reſounded with the noiſe of riot and debauchery; our peaceful citizens were hourly expoſed to ſhameful inſults, and often felt the effects of their violence and outrage. But this was not all: As though they thought it not enough to violate our civil Rights, they endeavoured to deprive us of the enjoyment of our religious privileges, to viciate our morals, and thereby render us de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of deſtruction. Hence the rude din of arms which broke in upon your ſolemn devotions in your temples, on that day hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Heaven, and ſet apart by God himſelf for his peculiar wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Hence, impious oaths and blaſphemies ſo often tortur'd your unaccuſtomed ear. Hence, all the arts which idleneſs and luxury could invent, were uſed, to betray our youth of one ſex into extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagance and effeminacy, and of the other to infamy and ruin; and did they not ſucceed but too well? Did not a reverence for reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion ſenſibly decay? Did not our infants almoſt learn to liſp out curſes before they knew their horrid import? Did not our youth forget they were Americans, and regardleſs of the admonitions of the wiſe and aged, ſervilely copy from their tyrants thoſe vices which <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

compelled to acknowledge, that even the nobleſt, faireſt part of all the lower creation did not entirely eſcape the curſed ſnare? When virtue has once erected her throne within the female breaſt, it is upon ſo ſolid a baſis that nothing is able to expel the heavenly inhabitant. But have there not been ſome, few indeed, I hope, whoſe youth and inexperience have render'd them a prey to wretches, whom upon the leaſt reflection, they would have deſpiſed and hated as foes to God and their country? I fear there have been ſome ſuch unhappy inſtances; or why have I ſeen an honeſt father cloathed with ſhame? or why a virtuous mother drowned in tears?</p>
            <p>BUT I forbear, and come reluctantly to the tranſactions of that diſmal night, when in ſuch quick ſucceſſion we felt the extremes of grief, aſtoniſhment and rage; when Heaven in anger, for a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful moment, ſuffer'd Hell to take the reins; when Satan with his choſen band open'd the ſluices of New-England's blood, and ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiouſly polluted our land with the dead bodies of her guiltleſs ſons. Let this ſad tale of death never be told without a tear; let not the heaving boſom ceaſe to burn with a manly indignation at the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſtory, thro' the long tracts of future time: Let every parent tell the ſhameful ſtory to his liſtening children till tears of pity gliſten in their eyes, and boiling paſſion ſhakes their tender frames; and whilſt the anniverſary of that ill-fated night is kept a jubilee in the grim court of pandaemonium, let all America join in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon prayer to Heaven, that, the inhuman, unprovok'd murders of the Fifth of March 1770, planned by Hillſborough, and a knot of treacherous knaves in Boſton, and executed by the cruel hand of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013314_0009_0F8FFB4E49029C30"/>
Preſton and his ſanguinary coadjutors, may ever ſtand on hiſtory without a parallel. But what, my countrymen, with-held the ready arm of vengeance from executing inſtant juſtice on the vile aſſaſſins? Perhaps you fear'd promiſcuous carnage might enſue, and that the innocent might ſhare the fate of thoſe who had performed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal deed. But were not all guilty? Were you not too ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the lives of thoſe who came to fix a yoke on your necks? But I muſt not too ſeverely blame a fault, which great ſouls only can commit. May that magnificence of ſpirit which ſcorns the low purſuits of malice, may that generous compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which often preſerves from ruin, even a guilty villain, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver actuate the noble boſoms of Americans!—But let not the miſcreant hoſt vainly imagine that we fear'd their arms. No; them we deſpis'd; we dread nothing but ſlavery. Death is the creature of a Poltroon's brains; 'tis immortality, to ſacrifice our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for the ſalvation of our country. We fear not death. That gloomy night, the pale fac'd moon, and the affrighted ſtars that hurried through the ſky, can witneſs that we fear not death.— Our hearts, which at the recollection glow with a rage that four revolving years have ſcarcely taught us to reſtrain, can witneſs that we fear not death; and happy 'tis for thoſe who dared to inſult us, that their naked bones are not now piled up an everlaſting monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Maſſachuſett's bravery. But they retir'd, they fled, and in that flight they found their only ſafety. We then expected that the hand of publick juſtice would ſoon inflict that puniſhment upon the murderers, which by the laws of God and man they had incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But let the unbiaſs'd pen of a Robinſon, or perhaps of ſome
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013314_0010_0F8FFB4F086C4000"/>
equally fam'd American, conduct this trial before the great tribunal of ſucceeding generations. And though the murderers may eſcape the juſt reſentment of an emaged people, though drowſy juſtice intoxicated by the poiſonous draught prepared for her cup, ſtill nods upon her rotten feat, yet be aſſured, ſuch complicated crimes will meet their due reward. Tell me, ye bloody butchers, ye villains high and low, ye wretches who contrived, as well as you who executed the inhuman deed, do you not feel the goads and ſtings of conſcious guilt pierce through your ſavage boſoms? Though ſome of you may think yourſelves exalted to a heighth that bids defiance to the arms of human juſtice, and others ſhrowd your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves beneath the maſk of hypocriſy, and build your hopes of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the low arts of cunning, chicanery and falſhood; yet, do you not ſometimes feel the gnawings of that worm which never dies? Do not the injured ſhades of Maverick, Gray, Caldwell, Attucks and Carr, attend you in your ſolitary walks, arreſt you even in the midſt of your debaucheries, and fill even your dreams with terror? But if the unappeaſed manes of the dead ſhould not diſturb their murderers, yet ſorely even your obdurate hearts muſt ſhrink, and your guilty blood muſt chill within your rigid veins, when you behold the miſerable Monk, the wretched victim of your ſavage cruelty. Obſerve his tottering knees which ſcarce ſuſtain his waſted body, look on his haggard eyes, mark well the deathlike paleneſs on his fallen cheek, and tell me, does not the ſight plant daggers in your ſouls? Unhappy Monk! Cut off in the gay morn of manhood from all the joys which ſweeten life, doom'd to drag on a pitiful exiſtence without even a hope to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013314_0011_0F8FFB50311C0968"/>
taſte the pleaſures of returning health! Yet Monk, thou liveſt not in vain; thou liveſt a warning to thy country which ſympathiſes with thee in thy ſufferings; thou liveſt an affecting, an alarming inſtance of the unbounded violence which luſt of power, aſſiſted by a ſtanding army, can lead a traitor to commit.</p>
            <p>FOR us he bled, and now languiſhes. The wounds by which he is tortur'd to a lingering death were aim'd at our country! ſurely the meek-eyed charity can never behold ſuch ſufferings with indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. Nor can her lenient hand forbear to pour oil and wine into theſe wounds; and to aſſuage at leaſt, what it cannot heal.</p>
            <p>PATRIOTISM is ever united with humanity and compaſſion. This noble affection which impels us to ſacrifice every thing <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, even life itſelf, to our country, involves in it a common ſympathy and tenderneſs for every citizen, and muſt ever have a <hi>particular feeling</hi> for one who ſuffers in a publick cauſe. Thoroughly perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of this, I need not add a word to engage your compaſſion and bounty towards a fellow citizen, who with long protracted anguiſh falls a victim to the relentleſs rage of our common enemies.</p>
            <p>YE dark deſigning knaves, ye murderers, parricides! how dare you tread upon the earth, which has drank in the blood of ſlaughter'd innocents ſhed by your wicked hands? How dare you breathe that air which wafted to the ear of heaven the groans of thoſe who fell a ſacrifice to your accurſed ambition? But if the labouring earth
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013314_0012_0F8FFB5049001F78"/>
doth not expand her jaws, if the air you breathe is not commiſſioned to be the miniſter of death; yet, hear it, and tremble! the eye of Heaven penetrates the darkeſt chambers of the ſoul, traces the leading clue through all the labyrinths which your induſtrious folly has deviſed; and you, however you may have ſcreen'd yourſelves from human eyes, muſt be arraigned, muſt lift your hands, red with the blood of thoſe whoſe death you have procur'd, at the tremendous bar of God.</p>
            <p>BUT I gladly quit the gloomy theme of death, and leave you to improve the thought of that important day, when our naked Souls muſt ſtand before that Being, from whom nothing can be hid.— I would not dwell too long upon the horrid effects which have already follow'd from quartering regular troops in this town; let our miſfortunes teach poſterity to guard againſt ſuch evils for the future. Standing armies are ſometimes, (I would by no means ſay generally, much leſs univerſally) compoſed of perſons who have render'd themſelves unfit to live in civil ſociety; who have no other motives of conduct than thoſe which a deſire of the preſent gratification of their paſſions ſuggeſts; who have no property in any country;—Men who have loſt or given up their own liberties, and envy thoſe who enjoy liberty; who are equally indifferent to the glory of a GEORGE or a Lewis; who for the addition of one peny a day to their wages would deſert from the chriſtian croſs, and fight under the creſcent of the Turkiſh Sultan; from ſuch men as theſe, what has not a ſtate to fear? With ſuch as theſe, uſurping Caeſar paſs'd the Rubicon; with ſuch as theſe he humbled mighty Rome,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013314_0013_0F8FFB51089259E8"/>
and forc'd the miſtreſs of the world to own a maſter in a traitor. Theſe are the men whom ſcepter'd robbers now employ to fruſtrate the deſigns of God, and render vain the bounties which his gracious hand pours indiſcriminately upon his creatures. By theſe the miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſlaves in Turkey, Perſia, and many other extenſive countries, are render'd truly wretched, though their air is ſalubrious, and their ſoil luxuriouſly fertile.—By theſe France and Spain, 'tho' bleſſed by nature with all that adminiſters to the convenience of life, have been reduc'd to that contemptible ſtate in which they now appear; and by theſe Britain — But if I was poſſeſs'd of the gift of prophecy, I dare not, except by divine command, unfold the leaves on which the deſtiny of that once powerful kingdom is inſcrib'd.</p>
            <p>BUT ſince ſtanding armies are ſo hurtful to a ſtate, perhaps, my countrymen may demand ſome ſubſtitute, ſome other means of ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering us ſecure againſt the incurſions of a foreign enemy. But can you be one moment at a loſs? Will not a <hi>well diſciplin'd militia</hi> afford you ample ſecurity againſt foreign foes? We want not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; it is diſcipline alone in which we are exceeded by the moſt formidable troops that ever trod the earth. Surely our hearts flutter no more at the ſound of war, than did thoſe of the immortal band of Perſia, the Macedonian phalanx, the invincible Roman legions, the Turkiſh Janiſſaries, the Gens des Armes of France, or the <hi>well known Grenadiers of Britain.</hi> A well diſciplin'd militia is a ſafe, an honourable guard to a community like this, whoſe inhabitants are by nature brave, and are laudably tenacious of that freedom in which they were born. From a well regulated militia we have nothing to
<pb n="15"
                   facs="unknown:013314_0014_0F90F1BAB7231108"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
fear; their intereſt is the ſame with that of the ſtate. When a country is invaded, the militia are ready to appear in it's defence; they march into the field with that fortitude which a conſciouſneſs of the juſtice of their cauſe inſpires; they do not jeopard their lives for a maſter who conſiders them only as the inſtruments of his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and whom they regard only as the daily diſpenſer of the ſcanty pittance of bread and water. No, they fight for their houſes, their lands, for their wives, their children, for all who claim the tendereſt names, and are held deareſt in their hearts, they fight <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> for their liberty, and for themſelves, and for their God. And let it not offend if I ſay, that no militia ever appear'd in more flouriſhing condition, than that of this province now doth; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me if I ſay,—of this town in particular.—I mean not to boaſt; I would not excite envy, but manly emulation. We have all one common cauſe; let it therefore be our only conteſt, who ſhall moſt contribute to the ſecurity of the liberties of America. And may the ſame kind providence which has watched over this country from her infant ſtate, ſtill enable us to defeat our enemies. I cannot here forbear noticing the ſignal manner in which the deſigns of thoſe who wiſh not well to us have been diſcovered. The dark deeds of a treacherous Cabal, have been brought to publick view. You now know the ſerpents who, whilſt cheriſhed in your boſoms, were darting their invenom'd ſtings into the vitals of the conſtitution. But the Repreſentatives of the people have fixed a mark on thoſe ungrateful monſters, which, though it may not make them ſo ſecure as Cain of old, yet renders them at leaſt as infamous. Indeed it would be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frontive to the tutelar deity of this country eve<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to deſpair of ſaving it from all the ſnares which human policy can lay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013314_0015_0F8FFB5474F3AA00"/>TRUE it is, that the Britiſh miniſtry have annexed a ſalary to the office of the Governor of this province, to be paid out of a revenue raiſed in America without our conſent. They have attempted to render our Courts of Juſtice the inſtruments of extending the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of acts of the Britiſh parliament over his colony, by making the Judges dependent on the Britiſh adminiſtration for their ſupport. But this people will never be enſlaved with their eyes open. The moment they knew that the Governor was not ſuch a Governor as the charter of the province points out, he loſt his power of hurting them. They were alarmed; they ſuſpected him, have guarded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and he has found that a wiſe and a brave people, when they know their danger, are fruitful in expedients to eſcape it.</p>
            <p>THE Courts of Judicature alſo ſo far loſt their dignity by being ſuppoſed to be under an undue influence, that our Repreſentatives thought it abſolutely neceſſary to Reſolve, that they were bound to declare that they would not receive any other ſalary beſides that which the General Court ſhould grant them; and if they did not make this declaration, that it would be the duty of the Houſe to Impeach them.</p>
            <p>GREAT expectations were alſo formed from the artful ſcheme of allowing the Eaſt India company to export Tea to America upon their own account. This certainly, had it ſucceeded, would have effected the purpoſe of the contrivers, and gratified the moſt ſanguine wiſhes of our adverſaries. We ſoon ſhould have found our trade in the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013314_0016_0F90F1BB73E90830"/>
hands of foreigners, and taxes impoſed on every thing which we conſumed; nor would it have been ſtrange, if in a few years a company in London ſhould have purchaſed an excluſive right of trading to America.—But their plot was ſoon diſcovered.—The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſoon were aware of the poiſon which with ſo much craft and ſubtilty had been concealed: Loſs and diſgrace enſued: and perhaps this long-concerted, maſter-piece of policy, may iſſue in the total diſuſe of TEA in this country, which will eventually be the ſaving of the lives and the eſtates of thouſands—Yet while we rejoice that the adverſary has not hitherto prevailed againſt us, let us by no means put off the harneſs. Reſtleſs malice, and diſappointed ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſtill ſuggeſt new meaſures to our inveterate <hi>enemies.</hi>—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let <hi>Us</hi> alſo be ready to take the field whenever danger calls, let us be united and ſtrengthen the hands of each other, by promoting a general union among us.—Much has been done by the Committtees of Correſpondence for this and the other towns of this province to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards uniting the inhabitants; let them ſtill go on and proſper. Much has been done by the Committees of Correſpondence for the Houſes of Aſſembly in this and our Siſter Colonies, for uniting the Inhabitants of the whole Continent for the ſecurity of their common intereſt. May ſucceſs ever attend their generous endeavours. But permit me here to ſuggeſt a general Congreſs of Deputies from the ſeveral Houſes of Aſſembly on the Continent, as the moſt effectual method of eſtabliſhing ſuch an Union as the preſent poſture of our affairs requires. At ſuch a Congreſs, a firm foundation may be laid for the ſecurity of our Rights and Liberties; a ſyſtem may be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for our common ſafety, by a ſtrict adherence to which we ſhall
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013314_0017_0F90F1BC3544BFD0"/>
be able to fruſtrate any attempts to overthrow our conſtitution; reſtore peace and harmony to America, and ſecure honor and wealth to Great-Britain, even againſt the inclinations of her miniſters, whoſe duty it is to ſtudy her welfare; and we ſhall alſo free ourſelves from thoſe unmannerly pillagers who impudently tell us, that they are licenced by an act of the Britiſh parliament to thruſt their dirty hands into the pockets of every American. But I truſt, the happy time will come, when with the beſom of deſtruction, theſe noxious vermin will be ſwept for ever from the ſtreets of Boſton.</p>
            <p>SURELY you never will tamely ſuffer this country to be a den of thieves. Remember, my friends, from whom you ſprang—Let not a meanneſs of ſpirit, unknown to thoſe whom you boaſt of as your Fathers, excite a thought to the diſhonour of your mothers. I conjure you by all that is dear, by all that is honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by all that is ſacred, not only that ye pray, but that you act; that, if neceſſary, ye fight, and even die for the proſperity of our Jeruſalem. Break in ſunder, with noble diſdain, the bonds with which the Philiſtines have bound you. Suffer not yourſelves to be betrayed by the ſoft arts of luxury and effeminacy, into the Pit dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for your deſtruction. Deſpiſe the glare of wealth. That peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who pay greater reſpect to a wealthy villain, than to an honeſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right man in poverty, almoſt deſerve to be enſlaved; they plainly ſhew that wealth, however it may be acquired, is in their eſteem, to be preferr'd to virtue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:013314_0018_0F90F1BD178020E8"/>BUT I thank GOD, that America abounds in men who are ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to all temptation, whom nothing can divert from a ſteady pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of the intereſt of their country; who are at once it's ornament and ſafe-guard. And ſure I am, I ſhould not incur your diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, if I paid a reſpect ſo juſtly due to their much honoured cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters in this public place; but when I name an ADAMS, ſuch a numerous hoſt of Fellow-patriots ruſh upon my mind, that I fear it would take up too much of your time, ſhould I attempt to call over the illuſtrious roll: But your grateful hearts will point you to the men; and their revered names, in all ſucceeding times, ſhall grace the annals of America. From them, let us, my friends, take example; from them let us catch the divine enthuſiaſm; and feel, each for himſelf, the God-like pleaſure of diffuſing happineſs on all around us; of delivering the oppreſſed from the iron graſp of tyranny; of changing the hoarſe complaints and bitter moans of wretched ſlaves, into thoſe cheerful ſongs, which freedom and contentment muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire. There is a heart-felt ſatiſfaction in reflecting on our exertions for the public weal, which all the ſufferings an enraged tyrant can inflict, will never take away; which the ingratitude and reproaches of thoſe whom we have ſav'd from ruin cannot rob us of. The vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous aſſertor of the Rights of mankind, merits a reward, which even a want of ſucceſs in his endeavours to ſave his country, the heavieſt miſfortune which can befall a genuine Patriot, cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely prevent him from receiving.</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:013314_0019_0F8FFB5670C3A480"/>I HAVE the moſt animating confidence that the preſent noble ſtruggle for liberty, will terminate gloriouſly for America. And let us play the man for our God, and for the cities of our God; while we are uſing the means in our power, let us humbly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our righteous cauſe to the great Lord of the univerſe, who loveth righteouſneſs and hateth iniquity.—And having ſecured the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of our hearts, by a faithful and unwearied diſcharge of our duty to our country, let us joyfully leave her important concerns in the hands of HIM who raiſeth up and putteth down the empires and kingdoms of the world as HE pleaſes; and with cheerful ſubmiſſion to HIS ſovereign will, devoutly ſay,
<q>Although the Fig-Tree ſhall not Bloſſom, neither ſhall Fruit be in the Vines; the Labour of the Olive ſhall fail, and the Fields ſhall yield no Meat; the Flock ſhall be cut off from the Fold, and there ſhall be no Herd in the Stalls: Yet we will rejoice in the LORD, we will joy in the GOD of our Salvation.</q>
