         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And this not only for my ſelf, but for thoſe, who have, as it were, broken thro' Order and Superiority, and deſcended to ſo low a Choice, as that of the Perſon now addreſſing this worthy Audience. Their Excuſe and mine is this, That not the Character of a <hi>Divine,</hi> ſo much as that of a <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> is under our preſent Conſideration: Not the <hi>Preacher,</hi> but the <hi>Singer</hi> carried the Vote, which laid him under Obligations to comply with their Requeſt.</p>
            <p>WHEREFORE that Juſtice in ſome meaſure may be done to the Divine Science of <hi>Muſic</hi> and <hi>Verſe,</hi> I ſhall have done with Prefaces and Apologies, and as in my poor Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002402_0008_0FDB3AACD0607588"/>I am able, illuſtrate, confirm and improve the Text under Conſideration.</p>
            <p>THE laſt and dying Words of Men uſe to be of Weight and Importance with the Survivors; and by them are wont to be eſteemed awful and full of Authority. How regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſoever we have been of the Sayings of wiſe and good Men, while they have been with us; yet that very Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of their <hi>leaving this World,</hi> gives Solemnity and Authority to what they deliver at their Departure out of it. Who knows not, that a Man <hi>a dying</hi> is able to make a greater and deeper Impreſſion upon us, than any of the <hi>Living?</hi> For as Time is drawing to a cloſe with <hi>them,</hi> ſo do they ſpeak with a more than humane <hi>Emphaſis,</hi> and diſcover ſuch an <hi>experimental Air,</hi> as cannot fail to touch the Hearers with the moſt lively and affecting Senſe of what they would communicate to them. As their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes are then contracted and grow very precious, ſo their Diſcourſe to the Living grows maſſy and full, it even fills up Time it ſelf, admitting no Vacancy of Moments unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with a Treaſure.</p>
            <p>THE four Verſes following my Text are worthy to be tranſcribed as ſuch, and may ſerve as a glorious Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to our Diſcourſe upon the <hi>Sweet Pſalmiſt of</hi> Iſrael; viz. <hi>David</hi>'s Character as a ſweet Singer, the Honour done him by God in the Record hereof, and the bleſſed End a Servant of God, famous for this Skill, may be able to make.</p>
            <p>THIS <hi>ſweet Pſalmist of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid</hi> with a more than mortal eloquence— <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſpake by me, and his Word was in my Tongue. The God of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid, the Rock of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſpake to me: He that ruleth over Men muſt be just, ruling in the Fear of God; and he ſhall be as the light of the Morning, when the Sun riſeth, even a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing without Clouds; as the tender Graſs ſpringing out of the Earth by clear ſhining after Rain. Altho' my Houſe be not ſo with God, yet he hath made with me an everlasting Covenant, ordered in all things and ſure: For this is all my Salvation and all my Deſire, altho' he make it not to grow.</hi>
            </p>

HERE we have verified the Fable of the expiring <hi>Swan</hi> ſinging her own Elegy; but with this Difference, that our dying Pſalmiſt tunes his Voice to Notes of Joy and Triumph, and not to the Keys of Mourning and Sadneſs. Theſe are <hi>David</hi>'s laſt Words, this his dying Song, which better than a Monument of Braſs, will conſecrate his deathleſs Fame to all Poſterity.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>who</hi> and <hi>what</hi> was he, that compoſed and ſung this divine Song?— <hi>It was</hi> David <hi>the Son of</hi> Jeſſe, <hi>and the Man who was raiſed up on high, the anointed of the God of</hi> Jacob. Even the Son of a common and inferior Man in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but exalted to the Regal Dignity and Charge over that great and holy Nation, by the <hi>anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the God of</hi> Jacob. The laſt Words of ſo great a Man, and ſo diſtinguiſhed in the Honours conferred upon him by Heaven, muſt command in us the moſt ſerious Attention and the higheſt Regard imaginable. They are the rich Legacy of a dying Prince, and to be received and laid up as an ineſtimable Treaſure.</p>
            <p>BUT this is not <hi>all</hi> of the noble Character of <hi>David,</hi> which does thus extort from us a Regard and Reverence to this his concluding Speech and Song. He that ſpake it, was not only a Godlike Prince, preferred by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before all the great Perſonages of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Kingly Power and Honours; but he was THE SWEET PSALMIST OF ISRAEL.</p>
            <p>THIS Part of his Character comes under our preſent Conſideration. Here therefore two Things are to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to, which will compriſe the whole of our preſent Diſcourſe.</p>

He was a <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> which Title contains in it two things, namely, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That as a Divine <hi>Poet,</hi> he compoſed Sacred Songs, and Hymns.

Finally, the <hi>Deſign and End</hi> of his <hi>Pſalms</hi> were conſecrate and pious, even to the great and good Intentions of the Glory of God, and the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Benefit of Men.</p>
            <p>BUT then, <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Title of <hi>Pſalmist</hi> carries in it not only that of a <hi>Piet,</hi> but of a <hi>Muſician</hi> alſo. Not only the Pſalms, but the Tunes to which they were to be ſet and ſung, were his. And the beſt both of Jewiſh and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Interpreters and Expoſitors do give Countenance to this Conjecture. But be this as it will, that his Skill both in Vocal and Inſtrumental <hi>Muſic</hi> was famous, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed upon all Hands. Whether or no he compoſed the Tunes, as well as the Pſalms, which he frequently ſent to the <hi>Pracentor</hi> or <hi>Chief Muſician,</hi> with his Orders for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them ſung or played, may admit of ſome Diſpute. But that he had a thorough Underſtanding of this ſweet and divine Science is a matter paſt all doubt. The <hi>Syriac</hi> and <hi>Arabic</hi> Verſions do favour our firſt Conjecture, and do intimate the Improvements he made in this Part of the Divine Service. They render the Words, <hi>Qui ſuaves red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit Cantus Iſraelis;</hi> Who <hi>made the Songs of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſweet.</hi> He raiſed them to a greater Perfection and Sweetneſs, than had ever been in <hi>Iſrael</hi> before. But to put this beyond all Diſpute, we are in the Sacred Oracles informed, that <hi>David</hi> did <hi>invent Inſtruments of Muſic,</hi> which were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely imitated, and proſtituted to the Deſigns of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, by the wanton <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> in the Days of the

We alſo read, that he ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated or ſet apart to the Services of Vocal and Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Muſic, the Sons of <hi>Aſaph, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>;</hi> appointing to every ſingle Muſician and to each Quire their Parts in the joint Performance of the Melodies and Anthems of the Temple. Whether for the Voice, or for Inſtruments, ſuch as the Cymbal, Pſaltery, Harp, the loud ſounding or Treble Horn; their Diſpoſition and Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was by the King's Order. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.1, 1, 6. And this he did, not meerly by Virtue of his Kingly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but as he was the <hi>Chief Maſter</hi> of the Temple-Muſic, his ſuperiour Skill therein rendring him the fitteſt Perſon in all <hi>Iſrael</hi> for that Office. But of this enough.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>DAVID</hi> was the <hi>Pſalmist of</hi> Iſrael; that is <hi>of the Church of God,</hi> which wears this Name and Title, with which the Patriarch <hi>Jacob</hi> was dignified, when he had wreſtled with the Angel of God in Prayer, and overcame: in this glorious Inſtance becoming the Head and Repreſentative of them that <hi>ſeek the Face of God.</hi> Pſal. 24.6. He became thenceforward the Father of the Generation of wreſtlers in Prayer, the Prince of them that prevail with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God of <hi>Jacob. Iſrael</hi> is a moſt proper and juſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of the <hi>Church Militant</hi> on Earth, who thro' holy Violence, ſtrong Faith, and ardent Importunity, maugre all the Oppoſition of Hell and Earth, <hi>take the Kingdom of Heaven by Force.</hi> Math. 11.12. O that in this ſweet Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of <hi>Singing,</hi> as well as the more laborious one of <hi>Prayer,</hi> we might make ſuch Improvements and Progreſs, as to deſerve the honourable Name of <hi>Iſraelites indeed!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR the Uſe and Benefit of the <hi>Church</hi> then did <hi>David</hi> compoſe his <hi>Pſalms,</hi> with <hi>Tunes</hi> adapted to the Subject Matter of them.

<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002402_0012_0FDB3AB4D7BDB688"/>or Glory; but for God and his <hi>Church.</hi> And a faithful Servant of God beholds all his Accompliſhments, whether Natural, Moral or Divine, under no other Notion or View, than that of ſo many Conſecrations to God, or Talents for the Improvement of which he is accountable to him. The Glory and Honour of God, the Good and Edification of the Church, is that to which they are to be ultimately and at all Times referred. And this is here recorded to the everlaſting Honour of King <hi>David,</hi> with reſpect to his religious Improvement of his extraordinary <hi>Poetical</hi> and <hi>Muſical</hi> Abilities. Which hints a ſevere Reproof of the Licentious <hi>Poeſy</hi> and <hi>Muſic</hi> of the preſent Age.</p>
            <p>FINALLY, He was a <hi>SWEET Pſalmist;</hi> in both the former Reſpects, even of his <hi>Muſic</hi> and his <hi>Poeſy.</hi> And this is what muſt come under a more large and diſtinct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. We are now therefore to diſcourſe of <hi>Divine Muſic,</hi> and <hi>Divine Poeſy:</hi> The latter relates to the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject matter</hi> of the Song, the former to the <hi>Manner and Form</hi> of the Tune, to which it is to be ſet or ſung. Wherefore</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>MUSIC</hi> conſidered alone and in it ſelf, <hi>is a ſweet and pleaſant Science.</hi> The Charms of <hi>Muſic</hi> are a moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Subject among the beſt Writers. And they are ſo various and ſo ſweet, that it is equally impoſſible to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them, and ſufficiently to admire them. There is ſcarce any thing in the whole Creation of God, ſo wonderful and aſtoniſhing, as the Doctrine of <hi>Sounds</hi> and <hi>Harmony.</hi> We ſhall attempt a Diſcourſe of the Sweetneſs of Muſic under the two following Heads.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. <hi>MUSIC is in its own Nature ſweet and pleaſant.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>2. <hi>IT is ſweet and pleaſant in the various Effects it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in the Souls of Men.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>MUSIC is in its own Nature ſweet and pleaſant.</hi> There is a twofold Sweetneſs and Pleaſancy of Sounds and Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Notes, according to the beſt Writers. There is, in the <hi>first</hi> Place, a <hi>Natural or Phyſical Sweetneſs</hi> in the Notes of Muſic. When a <hi>ſingle</hi> Voice or String of an Inſtrument ſo equally and juſtly vibrates the Air, as to give forth a Sound agreeable to the Organ of the Ear. Being free
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002402_0013_0FDB3AB62588BFD8"/>from all Jarr or Aſperity, it ſtrikes the <hi>Auditory Nerves</hi> in ſuch Manner as one <hi>Uniſon</hi> String percuſs'd or ſtrook, cauſes the other to ſhake and tremble. When the external Air is thus vibrated, the ſame or a like Vibration is effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in the internal Air repoſited in the Cavity of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, and this communicates its even and juſt Motion to the Nerves aforeſaid. In this Senſe, even the unaffected chirping Notes and ſmooth Warbles of the very Birds of Heaven, thoſe
<note n="*" place="bottom">Lord <hi>Roſcommon</hi>'s 148 <hi>Pſalm.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Idle Muſicians of the Spring,</hi> who are by their Creator, the Author of all Muſic, inſpired with an harmonious Inſtinct; I ſay, in this Senſe, even their art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Lays do ſerve to pleaſe and recreate us.</p>
            <p>BUT then <hi>Secondly;</hi> There is a <hi>Mathematical Sweetneſs and Pleaſancy</hi> in Sounds. This is no other than the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of <hi>Concords,</hi> to which there are required more Sounds than one, ſo proportioned and diſtanced in certain Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, as to create a pleaſant <hi>Harmony</hi> and Agreement. The Pleaſure ariſing from this <hi>Mathematical Sweetneſs</hi> or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of Sounds, is a more <hi>Intellectual</hi> Pleaſure; that from the <hi>Phyſical</hi> Sweetneſs, a more <hi>Senſual.</hi> Hence not only <hi>all Men,</hi> but the very <hi>Brutes</hi> too are capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a Delight in a ſingle pleaſant Sound or Voice, but <hi>none</hi> of the Brutal Race, nor <hi>all</hi> of the Humane are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of reliſhing the <hi>Melody</hi> ariſing from the harmonious Agreement of a Diverſity of Sounds. This requires a tuneful Soul, as well as a good Ear. As a late Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Poet well expreſſes it—
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>For Man may justly tuneful Strains admire,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>His SOUL is Muſic, and his Breaſt a Lyre.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Muſic the mighty Artiſt, Man can rule,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>So long as that has Numbers, he a SOUL.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>HERE let it be obſerved, that the <hi>Lowneſs</hi> and the <hi>Height</hi> of Sounds in the <hi>Gamut</hi> or Scale of Muſic, is not cauſed by the Strength and Force, but the <hi>Frequency</hi> of the Percuſſions, Strokes, or Tremors of the Air.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002402_0014_0FDB3AB77A127868"/>And when the Numbers of Tremors or Percuſſions of the Air cauſed by two Sounds, are <hi>proportionable,</hi> there is an harmonious Agreement of thoſe <hi>two Sounds;</hi> but if diſproportionate, a Diſcord is produced. Thus an <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tave</hi> or <hi>Eighth</hi> to a graver Sound, gives the Air <hi>two</hi> Percuſſions or Tremors to the others <hi>one.</hi> So they coincide every other Tremor; and one to two is propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate. The like may be ſaid of all other Chords. A <hi>Uniſon,</hi> or two Notes on a Pitch, is when two Sounds give the Air an equal Number of Pulſes or Strokes, and therefore ſo coincide in every Pulſe, as to become but one and the ſame Sound.—So that the Proportions that pleaſe the Eye in any <hi>Viſible Objects,</hi> are found to pleaſe the Ear in <hi>Audible Objects.</hi> And when two Concordant Notes of different Heights are Sounding, were the Sight of our Eyes ſo ſtrengthened and rendred ſo acute, as that we could accurately inſpect and diſcern the Particles of vibrated Air, we ſhould ſee the Tremors, or Vibrations of the Air <hi>proportionate in Arithmetical Numbers.</hi>—But while I am thus wading in the depths of <hi>Philoſophy,</hi> I had almoſt forgot the chief Thing I firſt aimed at, when I mentioned the <hi>mathematical Sweetneſs</hi> of Sounds, and that is as follows.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Muſic</hi> of the Temple, as it was under the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement and Direction of our <hi>Sweet Pſalmiſt of</hi> Iſrael, was a <hi>Chorus of Parts.</hi> The Singers and the Players upon Inſtruments, were divided into THREE Sets or Quires. One for the <hi>Baſs,</hi> another for the <hi>Medius</hi> or inner Parts; the third for the <hi>Trebles</hi> or <hi>Altus</hi>'s. Mr. <hi>Ford,</hi> in his Preface to his Expoſition on the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> has done to my Hand, what I might have attempted; even to prove that <hi>Muſic in Parts</hi> (in ſpight of popular Ignorance) is as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient as the Times of holy <hi>David.</hi>—I ſhall tranſlate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Sermon, what he ſays upon this Head.</p>
            <p>THE Modulation (ſays he) of the Voice only, or upon an Inſtrument only, or both together, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.22. and 98.5. and 33.2, 3. and 147.7. and 149.3. and 57.8, 9.) was generally and for the moſt part performed in <hi>three

            <p>BUT it is Time to paſs on to the Second Particular, which is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>MUSIC is ſweet and pleaſant, if we conſider the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Effects it is capable of producing in us.</hi> There is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <hi>Muſic,</hi> which is congenial to the Soul, and which for this Reaſon makes a ready Paſſage into its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Receſſes.

BUT let us come to the <hi>Theological</hi> Conſideration of the Point, and ſhew the bleſſed Influence and Effects of Harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny upon the Soul, as it is helpful to Devotion, either to excite, aſſiſt, promote or preſerve it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>IT creates a most Heſſed Serenity and quiet Calm in the Soul of the Worſhipper.</hi> He that would worſhip God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, ought to poſſeſs a quiet Mind, free from the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance and Agitation of Paſſions. So when the Soul of holy <hi>David</hi> was diſquieted in him, he knew not how to apply himſelf to the ſweet Exerciſe of Singing in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 42.11. and 43.4. His Thoughts within him were tumultuous, and various Paſſions haunted his Breaſt, while he was revolving in his Mind the Oppreſſion of the Enemy, his Abſence from the Houſe of God, and other afflictive and diſtreſſing Themes; he became hereupon wholly unfit for religious Exerciſes. So the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity hung their neglected Harps upon the Willows, when they remembred <hi>Zion,</hi> and their once glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and happy State, amidſt the Inſults of their barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Enemies. Say they, <hi>How ſhall we ſing the Lord's Songs in a ſtrange Land?</hi> Pſal. 137.4. Which is a ſure Proof how driving Paſſions, ſuch as Anger, Grief, Hatred, Fear, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> do ruffle the Soul, and wholly indiſpoſe it to the Exerciſes of Religion and Devotion.

How do they allay the turbid Paſſions, and chace the Diſturbers out of our Breaſt! <hi>Muſic</hi> has a natural Tendency to this. For as it is capable of being ſo ordered, as to raiſe and increaſe tumultuous Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Soul; ſo no leſs to allay and quiet theſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders.

And hence it is, that I find my Soul is become more Harmonious, by being accuſtomed ſo much to <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> and ſo averſe to all manner of <hi>Diſcord,</hi> that the leaſt jarring Sounds either in Notes or Words, ſeem ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry harſh and unpleaſant to me.</q>
            </p>

               <q>THAT there is (ſays he) ſomething more than ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in <hi>Muſic,</hi> appears from <hi>David</hi>'s making uſe of it, for <hi>driving away</hi> the evil Spirit from <hi>Saul;</hi> and <hi>Eliſha</hi> for the <hi>bringing the good Spirit</hi> upon himſelf. From which I am induced to believe, that there is really a ſort of ſecret and charming Power in it, that naturally diſpels from the Mind, all or moſt of thoſe black Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which the evil Spirit uſes to brood upon, and by compoſing it into a more regular, ſweet, and docible Diſpoſition, tenders it the fitter for the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> to work upon, the more ſuſceptive of Divine Grace, and

            </p>
            <p>THUS far he; and this is not the only Inſtance of the Uſe of <hi>Muſic</hi> in <hi>Propheſying;</hi> (which Word, by the Way, is not to be reſtrained to what we call <hi>Prediction,</hi> or the foretelling future Events by the Revelation of the Spirit of God, but compriſes alſo in its Meaning, the Power or Faculty of uttering any ſort of Divine Diſcourſes, by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of an <hi>Impetus</hi> or immediate Power from the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) I ſay, this is not the only Inſtance of the Uſe of <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic</hi> in order to <hi>Propheſying.</hi> The forementioned <hi>Saul</hi> meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a company of Prophets with their <hi>Muſic</hi> in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Exerciſe, is a further Confirmation of the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before us. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.5, 6. <hi>After that, thou ſhalt come to the Hill of God, where is the Garriſon of the</hi> Philiſtines, <hi>and it ſhall come to paſs when thou art come thither to the City, that thou ſhalt meet a company of Prophets coming down from the high Place, with a Pſaltery, and a Tahret, and a Pipe, and a Harp before them, and they ſhall Propheſy. And the</hi> Spirit of the Lord <hi>will come upon thee, and thou ſhalt Propheſy with them, and ſhalt be TURNED INTO ANOTHER MAN.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT to have done with particular Inſtances, let me add, that not only ſingle Perſons have occaſionally made uſe of <hi>Muſic,</hi> as a fit preparative for the Reception of the Spirit of God, but the <hi>ſtated Quires</hi> of the Church of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in their <hi>Ordinary Worſhip,</hi> propoſed no leſs Benefit from this divine Science, according to the Appointment of God. <hi>So the Sons of Jeduthun, Gedaliah, Zeri,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>under the Hands of their Father Jeduthun, propheſied with an Harp to give Thanks and to Praiſe the Lord.</hi> 1 Chron. 25.3.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole we may conclude, that Muſic is not only a Means provided by the God of Nature and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of all Religion, to diſpel and drive away the evil Influences of Satan, but alſo to prepare the Soul for the Reception of the Inſpiration of the holy Spirit. Nor will
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002402_0022_0FDB3ACBC8D667C8"/>the Objection of any thing <hi>Typical or Extraordinary</hi> in theſe Matters take away the Uſe of that which then had a natural Subſerviency and Tendency to produce theſe good Effects, and prepare the Soul for the ſublimeſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances in Religion and Worſhip. But</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>MUSIC happily ſerves to fix the Mind upon religious Objects, abstracting the Soul from every Diverſion.</hi> It ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſixes the wandring Spirit, making us retire within our ſelves, and be wholly employed in the preſent holy and delightful Exerciſe. It reduces the Mind to ſuch a ſweet Compoſure, as that all our Attention is faſtened upon the Subject of our Devotion. This <hi>Fixedneſs of Soul</hi> is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Preparation for our Entrance upon any Religious Employments, eſpecially thoſe of the Temple. So we find holy <hi>David</hi> addreſſing himſelf to the Worſhip of God. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.7, 8. <hi>My Heart is fixed,</hi> [or <hi>prepared;</hi> a fixed Heart is a prepared Heart.] <hi>O God, my Heart is fixed; I will ſing and give Praiſe. Awake my Glory, awake Pſaltery and Harp; I my ſelf will awake early. Divine Muſic,</hi> under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Influence of the bleſſed Spirit, the Author of all inward and ſpiritual Harmony, is an effectual Remedy for thoſe deſultory, looſe, and vagrant Frames of Spirit, which the moſt devout Chriſtians oftentimes experience, and as often bewail. It collects the ſcattered Powers of the Mind, and ſo unites them, that the Soul with unwonted Vigour and Strength mounts as on <hi>the Wings of Eagles,</hi> purſuing the glorious Flight, till ſhe is gotten beyond the View of mortal Things, and enters the <hi>holy of holies</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove. Then is ſhe rais'd and tranſported beyond the Limits of Time and Senſe, and is ſeated in the Lap of Eternity; where ſhe dwells upon everlaſting Themes, and becomes a ſharer in the ſweet and uninterrupted Bliſſes of Angels and glorified Saints.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>MUSIC is of good Uſe in Religious Worſhip, to excite and improve ſuitable and proper Affections, according to the Diverſity of Subjects, about which it is employed.</hi> The God of Nature has, beſide the <hi>Intellectual and Volitive</hi> Faculty, implanted in the Soul of Man, divers Affections and Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002402_0023_0FDB3ACFA0E7E3A0"/>Theſe are ſo many <hi>Ministers</hi> to the ſuperior Powers of Underſtanding and Willing. And by Conſequence, as theſe two are the <hi>prime Faculties</hi> of the Soul, which ought ever to be firſt in Exerciſe in our religious Approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the Divine Being, (the <hi>Intellect</hi> being the Power of ſpiritual Apprehenſion, Knowledge and Faith, and the <hi>Will</hi> the Principle of Divine Love, and all Devotion,) I ſay, as thoſe two Faculties are primarily and principally employed in all religious Exerciſes; ſo theſe Affections and Paſſions be of ſubordinate Uſe, and are ſubſervient to the ſame Deſigns of Religion and Devotion. For it was a groſs Miſtake in thoſe Philoſophers, who aſſerted them to be but the <hi>Foibles</hi> or Weakneſſes of the Soul, and <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally Sinful.</hi> No, they are naturally and phyſically <hi>Good,</hi> and when they have been endowed with the Sanctification of the Holy Ghoſt, they are of great and noble Uſe in Religion. This may ſerve to illuſtrate that of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 5.23. where he prays, that <hi>the God of Peace would ſanctify them wholly, and preſerve their whole Spirit, Soul and Body,</hi> &amp;c. That is, not only the ſuperior Powers of the Mind, ſuch as the Intellect and Will; and the infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and mechanic Powers of the Body; but alſo the <hi>paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate and affectionate</hi> Part, which is of a mixt Nature, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Animal and partly Spiritual. Now when theſe are <hi>ſanctified,</hi> they become capable of a moſt excellent Uſe and Improvement in Religion, eſpecially in all the devotionary Parts thereof. They are as it were the Wings of the Soul, whereby it is carried forth in all the Acts of holy Joy and Tranſport; Contrition and Mourning; Fervency and Zeal, and the like. But now what is more ſuited and adapted to excite and preſerve theſe Affections in their due and proper Exerciſe, than <hi>Muſic and Harmony?</hi> Whether the religious Soul be wholly employed upon Subjects of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition and Penitence, Sorrow and Mourning, <hi>Muſic</hi> can furniſh it with melancholy and graver Ayres: Or, if it dwells upon Themes of Joy and Praiſe, the loud and ſprightly Notes of the more chearful Keys ſhall raiſe the Soul to GOD, the Author of all good, and the Object of all our <hi>high Praiſes.</hi> And ſo of the reſt. Wherefore we frequently find the <hi>ſweet Pſalmist of</hi> Iſrael ſending his
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002402_0024_0FDB3AD0F8DD2100"/>Pſalms and Odes to the <hi>Chief Muſician,</hi> to be ſet to theſe or thoſe <hi>Tunes</hi> then practiſed in the Church of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And the Inſcriptions and Titles of the Pſalms do hint to us his Directions to the <hi>Master of Muſic</hi> in this Matter. Altho' the <hi>Tunes</hi> then in Uſe, and their Names and Keys are now to be reckoned among the <hi>Res deperditoe,</hi> loſt in the Ruins of Antiquity.</p>
            <p>BUT now we have been diſcourſing of <hi>Muſic,</hi> as it is able to excite and preſerve proper and ſuitable <hi>Paſſions</hi> and <hi>Affections,</hi> and to aſſiſt the <hi>Soul</hi> in the <hi>due Exerciſe</hi> of them, agreeable to the Variety of Themes or Subjects about which it is converſant; we are by a natural Tranſition to paſs on to the Conſideration of <hi>Muſic</hi> in its Conjunction with <hi>Divine Poeſy.</hi> Wherefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>AS MUSIC</hi> in it ſelf and ſeperately conſidered <hi>is Sweet, ſo much more does it deſerve that Character, when conſidered</hi> in its Conjunction <hi>with DIVINE POESY.</hi> Muſic joined with <hi>Numbers</hi> is in a tranſcendent Degree <hi>Sweet, Kircher</hi>

            </p>
            <p>WHAT we are now more eſpecially to ſpeak to, is this, that if we deſcend to the <hi>particular Subjects of Divine Poeſy,</hi> it will at firſt Thought be granted, that the Words and Matter of our ſpiritual Songs, ſuited and ſet to a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <hi>Muſic,</hi> convey a wonderful Charm into the Soul of a religious Worſhipper.

While the Soul is pouring out it ſelf in the moſt melting Strains, it conceives the ſenſe of the Love of God, and the aſſurance of a Pardon and Intereſt in his Favour. The kindly Contrition is mixed with an holy Joy thro' the Love of God ſhed abroad in the Soul!</p>

            <p>BUT it is high Time to paſs to the <hi>Second</hi> Thing to be obſerved in the Text, which I muſt but juſt touch upon, and which I wiſh were to be enlarged upon by a better Pen.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>LET us conſider the</hi> Honour <hi>done to</hi> David <hi>the ſweet Pſalmiſt and King of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>in this</hi> Record <hi>concerning him.</hi> The Mention of him as the <hi>ſweet Pſalmiſt of</hi> Iſrael, and the Tradition of this his Character to the lateſt Ages of Time in the Hiſtory of Scripture, is to be reckoned among none of the ſmalleſt Honours done to this Man of God. Here</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>GOD himſelf has put a great Honour upon him in this Record.</hi> And he is moſt aſſuredly the beſt Judge of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; yea, he is the Fountain from whence all true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour derives; and his Approbation and Teſtimony is the higheſt Dignity that can be conferred upon Mortals.

            <p>BUT this is not all the Honour done to King <hi>David,</hi> and ſo to all that have improved themſelves in this Divine Art of <hi>Muſic and Pſalmody,</hi> that he is there mentioned with Applauſe and Reſpect; but the <hi>Manner of this Record</hi> is a very honourable Circumſtance. This Part of his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſeems to be put upon a ſort of <hi>Parity</hi> with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Dignity and Imperial Glory. <hi>The Man who was raiſed on high, the anointed of the God of</hi> Jacob, <hi>THE SWEET PSALMIST OF</hi> ISRAEL! The <hi>ſweet Pſalmiſt of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and the anointed of the God of</hi> Jacob, are not unworthy of one another. The great Services this Man of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for the Church in the Capacity of a <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> are
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002402_0029_0FDB3AE00DFA27D0"/>eſteemed worthy to be enumerated with the Kingly Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours conferred upon him by the God of Heaven, and the glorious Adminiſtration of his Kingdom. Nor is King <hi>David</hi> the only Perſon to whom Heaven has done the Honour of a Record in the Liſts of Fame: The Scriptures afford us ſuch a Number of theſe Inſtances, as the Time would fail us to mention Ever from <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal the Father of all ſuch as handle the Harp and Organ, to</hi>

Moſes</hi> and <hi>Miriam, Aſaph</hi> and <hi>Haman,</hi> and a Multitude of thoſe who excelled in this ſweet and heavenly Skill, are honoured by God with a Record in his Word. But to conclude this Head, Not only in this World will God put all poſſible Marks of Reſpect and Honour upon them; but in the other he will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud and reward them before Men and Angels; exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them into the higheſt Quires of them that ſing the Praiſes of God to all Eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>THE Church of Saints and Angels will honour them.</hi> The <hi>Saints</hi> revere them as <hi>Leaders of the Quire,</hi> and do not fail to make an honourable Mention of them, as Reſtorers of the Worſhip of God, the Promotion and Perfection whereof lie very near their Hearts. Upon the Conſideration of theſe their Services to God and Religion, their Names are not only had in Reſpect by the Churches of Chriſt while they live, but ſhall be had in Remembrance, and diffuſe a ſweet Odour, be as an Oyntment poured forth, to all Poſterity. The Churches ſhall bleſs them after they are dead and gone, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member all their laudable Eſſays to render <hi>their</hi> Worſhip of God, ſweet and beautiful, orderly and edifying. Then ſhall it be ſaid of the Church, <hi>This and that Man was born of her,</hi> who excelled in the heavenly Exerciſe of <hi>Muſic</hi> and of <hi>ſinging of Pſalms.</hi> Theſe were they who firſt taught us to ſing the Songs of <hi>Zion,</hi> and after the beſt Manner to chant forth the Praiſes of our God! Thus do the Church
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002402_0030_0FDB3AE19797E6D8"/>of Saints honour them, as they are an Honour and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Church.</p>
            <p>YEA the <hi>Church of Angels,</hi> who always rejoice in the good Improvements of the Church on Earth, conceive no ſmall Delight and Satisfaction in the Eſſays of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men to imitate their <hi>Hallelujahs,</hi> and bring them as near as poſſible to the ſame heavenly Perfection. They being Witneſſes of our Worſhip, and ever preſent in the Aſſemblies of the Saints, are highly gratified to behold us ſtriving to bear a Part in their Quire. They look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us with Honour and Reſpect; and as by the Goſpel we are brought to <hi>join</hi>
