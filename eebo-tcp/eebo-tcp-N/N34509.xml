            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS fatal, Soul-deſtroying, GOD-diſhonouring diſeaſe, firſt made its appearance in the garden of Eden. It was introduced by that infernal foe to GOD and man, called the devil, the means by which the firſt man came by his death, and that monſter ſin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap> God and the deſtruction of man. Satan ſucceeding ſo well by means of this diſeaſe in the garden of Eden, has, from time to time, attempted to ſpread the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order in various parts of our earth, by ſending his emiſſaries with the infection, bound up in a bundle of articles called by them Goſpel Truths: but the truth is, they are Antinomian hereſies, poiſonous in their nature, and pernicious to the ſouls of men. The enemy having lately ſent from the eaſt a bundle of his wares to this city, I thought it my duty to alarm my fellow-citizens of the danger they are in—the plague having actually broken out,—ſome are already dead, and others in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger. In order, therefore, to preſerve the ſound from the infection, I ſhall ſhew ſome cauſes of the diſorder, with the means of preventing it from becoming fatal; ſecondly, the ſymptoms attending the diſorder, and laſtly, preſcribe the remedy for ſuch in
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:045169_0002_101FC1A7C36147B8"/>whom the diſorder is not rooted—I ſay in whom the diſorder is not rooted; for in all others, it is probable, means will prove ineffectual, as the Scriptures ſay, God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a lie, &amp;c. 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> ii. 11.</p>
            <p>Firſt, the Cauſes. This diſorder is generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by an unwholeſome ſtagnated, putrid air, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the mouth of the deceivers, foretold by that moſt eminent phyſician of infinite value, JEHO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VAH JESUS, (who told his diſciples there ſhould ariſe falſe prophets, who, if it were poſſible, would deceive even the elect.) Hence it prevails in a furnace, ſituate in Second between Walnut and Cheſnut-ſtreets, Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, alſo in the north eaſtern parts of theſe ſtates.</p>

            <p>Self-confident perſons are much in danger of being infected, and thoſe of an effeminate weakly habit, in a ſpiritual ſenſe; but eſpecially thoſe good ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who pretend to more charity than is commanded in the Scriptures, are in imminent danger.</p>
            <p>Advice to the ſound—Come not within ſcent of the ſmoke of the furnace. Keep no company with infected perſons except duty calls. Endeavor to keep your minds clean and clear of Antinomian notions; for cleanlineſs is greatly conducive to health, and to prevent diſorders. Exerciſe alſo is an excellent antidote; therefore, be much in prayer, and reading your Bible, walking in the good old way of JEHOVAH'S commandments daily and hourly.</p>
            <p>SYMPTOMS. The Murrinitiſh plague is generally preceded by a remarkable weakneſs in the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſpecting the plain, ſimple truths of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:045169_0003_101FC1AAAFB8B490"/>as appeared evidently in the caſe of Eve, when, for SURELY, ſhe takes LEST.</p>
            <p n="2">2d. Dimneſs of ſight precedes this fatal diſorder. The infected cannot ſee, throughout the ſacred volume, one text (among the many hundreds) that ſpeaks againſt their beloved ſyſtem.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. The head of the infected ſwells amazingly; yea to an enormous ſize, ſo that with truth it may be ſaid, (according to their conceit of their knowledge) that a boy of three days old has a bigger head than either that of Gog or Magog, which ſtands in Guildhall, London, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. The tongue alſo of the infected appears as if it was tipt with ſilver; and, being ſmooth as oil, runs at an amazing rate, but preſently grows prodigious thick, and ſpeaks great ſwelling words of vanity, crying,— Peace, Peace, where there is no peace; rejoicing that they are ſufficiently wiſe to prove, that the primeval cauſe of ſin will at laſt be found to lay at the threſhold of Heaven; and conſequently, that the whole race of fallen men muſt be redeemed upon the principles of unſullied goodneſs. This is a fatal ſymptom, and is a certain ſign, that the perſon is given up to ſtrong deluſion.</p>
            <p n="5">5th. A delirium comes on, which ends in mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and operates in the following manner—The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, like another mad dog, runs howling about, trying to bite every one he comes acroſs, foaming at the mouth amazingly; they don't act like the prophets dumb dogs, that cannot bark. No—quite the reverſe: they yelp and howl in a tremendous manner, diſturbing whole neighbourhoods, and grieving the favorites of Heaven—As ſaith the Lord, With lies ye have made the heart of the righteous ſad, whom I have not made ſad, and ſtrengthened the hands of the wicked, that he ſhould not return from his wicked way by promiſing him life, <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> xiii. 22. Frequent vomitings ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed their madneſs. I am not phyſician enough to ſay it is the bile; but it is certainly bitterneſs that they throw up in abundance: yet they have ſo far loſt their
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:045169_0004_101FC1B0AC78DB70"/>taſte, as to conceit that this gall of theirs is ſweet goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truth. They roll the diabolic preparation as a ſweet morſel under their tongue. Woe unto their ſouls, for they have ſinned; they call evil good, and good evil; bitter ſweet, and ſweet bitter. Horrid madneſs! At length they become goſpel proof, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears: for if in pity to their ſouls, the ſervant of Ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuel, "knowing the terror of the Lord, perſuade" them of the neceſſity of a new or ſecond birth, (like poor mad things indeed) they cry Chriſt was born again. Or if we preach and teach the neceſſity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and faith, they madly anſwer, Chriſt repented, Chriſt believed, &amp;c. "O fooliſh people, and unwiſe! thus to wreſt the Scriptures to their own deſtruction;" but the Scriptures muſt be fulfilled. For ſaith the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Saviour, Thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed them unto babes; even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight. No wonder that modern orators and rhetoricians are puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled at plain goſpel truths, when of old they were to the learned Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the wiſe Greeks fooliſhneſs. But as the elect cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſeeing the foundation ſtandeth ſure, we will rejoice, though the world be moved out of its place.</p>
            <p>The Murrinitiſh plague may be diſtinguiſhed from the Wincheſtrian: inaſmuch as the Murrinites falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly profeſs Calviniſm, and the Wincheſtrians Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianiſm: again, the Murrinites profeſs enmity to the devil, the Wincheſtrians great friendſhip—though it is a query, whether he (the devil) uſed them one bit the better for that.</p>
            <p>Wincheſtrian plagues may be converted into Murri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitiſh, by the party coming too nigh the ſmoke of the furnace, when well heated. The duration of the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinitiſh plague is extremely uncertain. I have heard of one of the infected being extremely ill for ſeveral years, and in his mad fit bit ſeveral, and grievouſly infected them; but toward the cloſe of his life, 'tis ſaid he was
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:045169_0005_101FC1B244A88910"/>perfectly cured. Some, it is to be feared, remain confirmed maniacs, 'till ſuch time as the flames of the tremendous volcano feelingly convince them, and bring them to their ſenſes to their eternal ſorrow. The moſt favourable ſymptom is a mild ſweat, coming on in a few days, occaſioned by fears ariſing in the mind, leſt the whole ſyſtem ſhould be fallacious, and they fall with their bottomleſs ſuperſtructure into that place, where <hi>hope</hi> never comes; this, I ſay, is a ſymptom that the diſorder is not rooted. In ſuch caſe there is ground to hope, and it is rational to uſe proper means for their recovery; but if they foam at the mouth, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to bite, and infect others, or if they rave exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, when the water of that ſtream, that makes glad the city of God, is offered to them—I ſay, if they maliciouſly try to ſpill the water, and endeavour to bite the perſon offering it to them, 'tis a fatal ſymptom that death is approaching. In ſuch caſes there is no phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician in this country can do them good, though there are ſeveral very eminent, as Mr. Baptiſt, Mr. Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian, Mr. Epiſcopalian, Mr. Independent, Mr. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieldian, &amp;c. &amp;c. Theſe are very ſkilful men, and have all ſtudied, and practiſed with great ſucceſs under the phyſician of infinite value. But I ſay, though they may be able to preſcribe the antidote, yet it will not avail, unleſs applied by the ſkilful hand of the famous, divinely glorious, ineffable phyſician, JESUS CHRIST; and conſequently can do them no good. But, as in ſome caſes, good may be done, I proceed.</p>
            <p>Regimen. In the management of this diſorder we ought to endeavour to counteract the putrid tendency of the humours, by geatly promoting perſpiration, that is, if poſſible, to bring on a warm ſweat, produced from the conſideration afore-mentioned.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. It has been obſerved, that the Murrinitiſh plague is generally occaſioned by unwholeſome air, and of courſe it muſt be greatly aggrevated by it; care muſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:045169_0006_101FC1B6D36681C8"/>therefore be taken, that no Murrinitiſh bellows be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in the mad perſon's chamber; alſo I adviſe, that no infected perſon be left alone with the diſeaſed, leſt in his mad fits he ſhut to the door, and blow the Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinitiſh bellows, and the putrid air ſtagnate, which will greatly increaſe the malady; but rather let there be a frequent admiſſion of freſh and wholeſome air conveyed by the means of a ſervant of the <hi>ſanctuary, blowing through the genuine ſilver trumpet of uncorrupted truth.</hi> The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient's head ought to be frequently ſprinkled with the aſhes of Sodom and Gomorrah, if they can be obtained, and his mind with ideas of everlaſting fire; alſo pictures of the damned ought to be placed round the room, and every ſtrong ſcented herb that can be got from Sinai's mount, laid in different parts of the houſe, and ſmelled to by thoſe that go near the patient. A ſmall quantity of Jeremiah's wormwood and gall ought frequently to be injected into his mind: this is a great aſtringent, and ſhould be mixed in all his food as well as drink. The patient muſt have his head kept moderately cool, and as free as poſſible from Antinomian notions. His food muſt be light, ſuch as the milk of the word, and not ſtrong meat, for he will not be able to bear it: he may eat roaſted apples, provided they be taken from the apple tree of the goſpel; and as to his drink, I would recommend the juice of this excellent fruit above all others.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Medicine. A vomit is abſolutely neceſſary in the beginning of the diſorder; however, I would not recommend a doſe of Tartar emetic, but rather take three ſcruples of right reaſon, one grain of conſideration, and a quarter of an ounce of common ſenſe, make them into a bolus, and force him to ſwallow it, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, (though depend upon it, it will go much againſt him; and I dare venture to ſay, if it can be got down, it will preſently make him caſt the bile, or rather the diabolic bitterneſs from his ſtomach. As to bliſtering, I would by no means recommend it; for if the patient

But the only ſovereign remedy is in the chief phyſician's hands, and ſolely at his diſpoſal; the leaſt grain of which, yea, if divided into ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand parts, and one of thoſe parts divided into ten thouſand more, ad infinitum,—I ſay, if the ſmalleſt of theſe parts be received into the patient's heart, it will not fail of making a perfect cure. This medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine is given gratis to all who aſk for it, by the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etor, at the ſign of the Fountain opened for ſin and for uncleanneſs. But as it is likely the patient will be deterred from making application, by reaſon of a vain conceit, that he already poſſeſſes a ſufficient quantity, which the diſeaſe naturally inclines him to)—It will therefore evidence a generous mind in thoſe, who are ſtill preſerved from the pernicious infection, to make application to the good phyſician on his behalf; and who knows but he may ſend by their hand, and make them inſtrumental in delivering their periſhing fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal from that which is infinitely worſe than the plagues of Egypt,—the Murrinitiſh ſyſtem of ſatanical divinity.</p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome may aſk, why ſo ſatirical? I anſwer, becauſe Solomon hath ſaid, Anſwer a fool according to his folly; and as it is evident theſe unhappy people have done with both ſcripture and reaſon, as appears by their treating, with the greateſt contempt, the moſt ſolid, convincing arguments made uſe of by very able miniſters of the New Teſtament,—I therefore thought it beſt for me to follow Elijah's example; and, in this mode, bear teſtimony againſt this pernicious <hi>error</hi> of the day. I expect to be cenſured by the Univerſal Antinomians, as they are a people poſſeſſed of a more than ordinary degree of charity, and ſometimes take an odd way to ſhew their love; but I defy them to uſe me worſe than their ſyſtem doth my maſter <hi>Jeſus.</hi> For, brethren, be not deceived; God is not mocked: what
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:045169_0008_101FC1BB35A9B390"/>a man ſows, that ſhall he alſo reap. There is a day—a dreadful day—coming, that ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud <hi>(boaſters)</hi> and all they that wickedly depart from the truth, ſhall be as ſtubble, yea as fuel, on which that eternal fire will moſt ſurely kindle, and which will <hi>never, never, never</hi> be extinguiſhed.</p>
            <p>It is, then, the infinitely bleſſed, the greatly injured, the awfully belied majeſty of Heaven, will prove to the overlaſting ſhame of every enemy of truth, that his throne is eſtabliſhed in juſtice and judgment—Then the beſotted <hi>Antinomian</hi> will be feelingly convinced, that his damnation lies at his own door, and that the <hi>Lord</hi> tempteth no man to ſin, much leſs forceth angels nor man, by an irrevocable decree, to do that which his holy foul hateth. <hi>James</hi> i. xiii, xiv. Let no man ſay, when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and enticed. Horrid thought! to think or ſay, that God is the author of ſin!</p>
            <p>Oh! my ſoul come not near their dwelling! Lord; what is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               </gap>; half <hi>beaſt,</hi> half <hi>devil;</hi> but he might with propriety have ſaid, that the <hi>natural</hi> man is <hi>whole devil,</hi> and ſpoke within the bounds of charity too. But I forbear.—<hi>God is judge</hi> himſelf, and will take <hi>vengeance</hi> on his enemies, and cut off thoſe in due time, that trouble his church. <hi>But the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall he ſaved with an everlaſting ſalvation, to the praiſo of his glorious grace, world without end.</hi> Amen.</p>
