            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>ADVERTISEMENT</hi> to the <hi>London EDITION.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Reader may depend upon the following Poem being the genuine production of a native of America: The Author is not vain enough to flatter himſelf, that it will throw any freſh luſtre on the character of General WASH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGTON, or entitle his unſkilful muſe to the ſmalleſt degree of poetical ſame. His ſole view in penning this epiſtle was to expreſs, in the beſt manner he was able, the warm feelings of a grateful individual towards that diſtinguiſhed and beſt of men; to whom he, and every American, will in all likelihood be indebted for the independence and commercial proſperity of his country. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The ſole motive for publiſhing this Poem, and adding thereto a ſketch of the Life and Character of General Waſhington (which the Editor now gives to the Reader in the plain unaltered narrative of the Author, who is connected and intimate in the family of that great man) is for the charitable purpoſe of raiſing a few guineas to relieve, in a ſmall meaſure, the diſtreſſes of ſome hundreds of American priſoners, now ſuffering confinement in the gaols of England. The profits ariſing from the ſale of this book will be faithfully appropriated to that purpoſe; and this the Editor reſts aſſured will be a much ſtronger incitement for the benevolent and humane to become purchaſers of it, than any intrinſic value the performance may demand.</p>
                  <p>Very large and liberal ſums were given for this charitable purpoſe in January <hi>1778.</hi> The Committee appointed for its diſtribution, to prevent an overflow of public generoſity, cloſed the ſubſcription, thinking it was very ample; and hoped that after ſome ſhort period no priſoners, in this ever to be lamented war, would on either ſide remain. That hope having vaniſhed, the progreſs of calamity not being ſtopt, and no proſpect of its concluſion, the Committee again opened the ſubſcription; and with a degree of ſucceſs that places the character of the nation and of individuals in the moſt honorable light, by proving that their humanity is not the capricious or faſhionable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of the moment, but a conſtant impulſe, and the deliberate reſult of their reaſon. This additional ſubſcription, though diſburſed with oeconomy, is now expended, and the wants of theſe unhappy ſufferers nearly as extenſive as ever. The pains of captivity cannot be much lightened by this ſmall mite of an obſcure individual; but ſuch munificent donations as have been made by Engliſhmen towards their relief, muſt ſtamp a leſſion on the minds of thoſe unfortunate captives, and our American brethren in general, that they ſhould not withdraw all national affection from a country, the bulk of whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants have not withdrawn all national affection from them.</p>

If there are any of the Generous and Humane who have not yet ſubſcribed to the relief of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Priſoners, this publication gives them a fair op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to exerciſe their benevolence, by ſending their donations for this book to the publiſhers; which they may be aſſured will be faithfully applied, as it will be paid into the Committee for American Priſoners by the Editor.</p>

               <g ref="char:dtristar">*⁎*</g> Fifteen Thouſand Copies of this POEM were Sold in the City of London, in about Three Weeks, at Two Shillings and Sixpence Sterling, each, and the Money appropriated to the Benefit of the American Priſoners.</p>

            <p>IN compliance with the requeſt you made me in your laſt obliging letter, I ſet down to inform you of every intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing particular that has come to my knowledge concerning the life and character of General Waſhington; and I do this with the greater cheerfulneſs, as I flatter myſelf I ſhall be able to communicate a more accurate and circumſtantial account of this illuſtrious perſonage than has ever hitherto been laid before the public. If, from what I ſhall ſay, the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge you already have of this excellent man can be any-way improved, or any luſtre can be added to that bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy of character, which you give me to underſtand he poſſeſſes in the eyes of Europe, I ſhall deem the pains I have been at, in procuring the following intelligence, as highly compenſated.</p>
            <p>General Waſhington is the third ſon of Mr. Auguſtine Waſhington, a man of large property and diſtinguiſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation in the ſtate of Virginia: an anceſtor of this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:017436_0015_0FA11FD732106FD0"/>
about the period of the Revolution, ſold his property, near Cave, in the Eaſt Riding of Yorkſhire, and came over to Virginia, where he purchaſed lands in King George's County; and it was here that our hero was born on the 22d of February in the year 1733. In this county he has at this time three brothers, Samuel, John, and Charles, all gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of conſiderable landed property, and a ſiſter who is mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to colonel Fielding Lewis. His elder brother Lawrence, who went out a captain of the American troops, raiſed for the Carthagena expedition, married the daughter of the honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able William Fairfax, of Belvoir, in Virginia, by whom he left one daughter, who dying young, and his ſecond brother alſo dying without iſſue, the general ſucceeded to the family-ſeat, which, in compliment to the gallant admiral of that name, is called Mount Vernon, and is delightfully ſituated on the Potomack River, a few miles below Alexandria. General Waſhington is the eldeſt ſon by a ſecond marriage; and, having never been out of America, was educated (as youths of fortune in this country generally are) under the eye of his father by private tutorage: a ſlight tincture of the Latin language, a grammatical knowledge of his mother-tongue, and the elements of mathematics, were the chief objects he was taught to purſue. For a few years after he quitted his tutor, he applied himſelf to the practical part of ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (a knowledge of which is eſſentially requiſite to men of landed property in this country) and was appointed ſurveyor to a certain diſtrict in Virginia; an employment rather cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditable
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:017436_0016_0FA11FD7F241A960"/>
than lucrative; though it afforded him an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of chuſing ſome valuable tracts of land, and made him thoroughly acquainted with the frontier country.</p>
            <p>On the governor and council of Virginia receiving orders from England, in October 1753, to repel by force the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the French on the weſtern frontiers, along the rivers Ohio and de Boeuf, Mr. Waſhington, then a major in the provincial ſervice, and an adjutant-general of their forces, was diſpatched by general Dinwiddie, with a letter to the commander in chief of the French on the Ohio, complaining of the inroads they were making in direct violation of the treaties then ſubſiſting between the two crowns; he had alſo inſtructions to treat with the ſix nations and other weſtern tribes of Indians, and to engage them to continue firm in their attachment to England. He ſet out on this perilous em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy, with about fifteen attendants, late in October 1753; and ſo far ſucceeded, that on his return with monſieur de St. Pierre's anſwer, and his good ſucceſs in the Indian negocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he was complimented with the thanks and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his country. His journal of the whole tranſaction was publiſhed in Virginia, and does great credit to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, attention, and judgment; and it has ſince proved of infinite ſervice to thoſe who have been doomed to traverſe the ſame inhoſpitable tracts.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, the deſigns of the French becoming more manifeſt, and their movements and conduct more daring, orders were iſſued out by adminiſtration for the colonies to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:017436_0017_0FA11FD8B38DD0A0"/>
arm and unite in one confederacy. The aſſembly of Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia took the lead by voting a ſum of money for the public ſervice, and raiſing a regiment of four hundred men for the protection of the frontiers of the colony. Major Waſhington, then about twenty-three years of age, was appointed to the command of this regiment, and before the end of May, in the enſuing year, came up with a ſtrong party of the French and Indians, at a place called Red-ſtone, which he effectually routed, after having taken and killed fifty men. Among the priſoners were the celebrated woods-man monſieur De La Force and two other officers, from whom colonel Waſhington had undoubted intelligence, that the French force on the Ohio conſiſted of upwards of one thouſand regulars, and ſome hundreds of Indians. Upon this intelligence, although his little army was ſomewhat reduced, and intirely inſufficient to act offenſively againſt the French and Indians, yet he puſhed on towards his enemy to a good poſt; where, in order to wait the arrival of ſome expected ſuccour from New York and Pennſylvania, he entrenched himſelf, and built a ſmall fort, called Fort Neceſſity. At this poſt he remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted, and without any ſuccour until the July following; when his ſmall force, reduced now to leſs than three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, was attacked by an army of French and Indians of eleven hundred and upwards, under the command of the Sieur de Villiers. The Virginians ſuſtained the attack of the enemy's whole force for ſeveral hours, and laid near two hundred of them dead in the field, when the French com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, diſcouraged by ſuch determined reſolution, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed

the leſs dangerous method of diſlodging his enemy by a parley, which ended in an honourable capitulation. It was ſtipulated that colonel Waſhington ſhould march away with all the honours of war, and be allowed to carry off all his military ſtores, effects, and baggage. This capitulation was violated from the ungovernable diſpoſition of the ſavages, whom the French commander could not reſtrain from plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the provincials on the onſet of their march, and from making a conſiderable ſlaughter of men, cattle, and horſes. This breach of the capitulation was ſtrongly remonſtrated againſt by the Britiſh ambaſſador at the Court of Verſailles, and may be looked upon as the aera when the French court began to unmaſk, and to avow (though in a clandeſtine manner) the conduct of their governors and officers in America: they redoubled their activity and diligence on the Ohio, and in other places during the winter 1754 and the following ſpring. Virginia had determined to ſend out a larger force; the forts Cumberland and Louden were built, and a camp was formed at Wills Creek, from thence to annoy the enemy on the Ohio. In theſe ſeveral ſervices (particularly in the conſtruction of the forts) colonel Waſhington was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally employed, when he was ſummoned to attend general Braddock, who with his army arrived at Alexandria, in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia, in May, 1755. The deſign of ſending out that army, was to penetrate through the country to Fort du Queſne (now Fort Pitt) by the route of Wills Creek; and as no perſon was better acquainted with the frontier country than colonel Waſhington, and no one in the colony enjoyed ſo well

eſtabliſhed a military character, he was judged highly ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to general Braddock, and cheerfully quitted his command to act as a volunteer and aid de camp under that unfortunate general. The particulars of the defeat, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt total ruin of Braddock's army, conſiſting of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand regular Britiſh forces, and near eight hundred provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, are too well known to need a repetition: it is allowed on all ſides, that the haughty poſitive behaviour of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, his high contempt of the provincial officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and his diſdainful obſtinacy in rejecting their advice, were the genuine cauſes of this fatal diſaſter. With what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution and ſteadineſs the provincials and their gallant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander behaved on this trying occaſion, and in covering the confuſed retreat of the army <note n="*" place="bottom">See captain Orme's letter to Governor Dinwiddie, and alſo the other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of that day.</note>, let every Britiſh officer and ſoldier confeſs, who were reſcued from ſlaughter on that calamitous day by their valour and conduct.</p>
            <p>After general Braddock's diſaſter, the colony of Virginia found it neceſſary to eſtabliſh her militia, raiſe more men, ſtrengthen her forts, undertake expeditions to check the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads of the enemy, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. In all which important ſervices colonel Waſhington bore a principal ſhare, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted himſelf to the utmoſt ſatisfaction of his country, by diſplaying on every occaſion, the moſt perſevering induſtry, perſonal courage, and military abilities. He was again ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the command of the Virginia troops, and held it
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:017436_0020_0FA11FDAF1E65678"/>
with ſingular credit till his reſignation in 1759, when he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the young widow of Mr. Cuſtis, his preſent lady; with whom he had a fortune of twenty thouſand pounds ſterling in her own right, beſides her dower in one of the principal eſtates in Virginia. From this period he became as aſſiduous to ſerve the ſtate as a ſenator, as he had hitherto been active to defend it as a ſoldier. For ſeveral years he repreſented Frederick County, and had a ſeat for Fairfax County, at the time he was appointed by the aſſembly, in conformity with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal wiſh of the people, to be one of their four delegates at the firſt general congreſs. It was with no ſmall reluctance that he engaged again in the active ſcenes of life; and I ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely believe that no motives but ſuch as ſpring from a moſt diſintereſted patriotiſm could have ever prevailed upon him to relinquiſh the moſt refined domeſtic pleaſures, which it was ever in his power to command, and the great delight he took in farming and the improvement of his eſtate. You well know that general Waſhington is, perhaps, the greateſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder in America (the proprietors of Pennſylvania, Maryland<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the Northern Neck excepted;) for beſides his lady's fortune, and ten thouſand pounds falling to him by the death of her only daughter, he has large tracts of land taken up by himſelf early in life, ſome conſiderable purchaſes made from officers who had lands allotted them for their ſervices; and has, moreover, made great additions to his eſtate at Mount Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. It is impoſſible in this country, as in England, to rate the value of eſtates by their annual rent or income, becauſe they are univerſally tilled by negroes, and in the hands of land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:017436_0021_0FA11FDBB26FCDE0"/>
There are many eſtates in the middle colonies, which never produced a clear income to their owners of five hundred a year, that may be eaſily ſold for forty thouſand pounds. General Waſhington's, however, will not be over-rated, if ſet down at a good four thouſand pounds Engliſh per annum, and his whole property could not be bought for forty years purchaſe.</p>
            <p>When it was determined at length in Congreſs, after every ſtep towards an accommodation had failed, and every petition from America had been ſcornfully rejected, to repel by force the invaſion from Great Britain, the eyes of the whole continent were immediately turned upon Mr. Waſhington. With one common voice he was called forth to the defence of his country; and it is, perhaps, his peculiar glory, that there was not a ſingle inhabitant of theſe ſtates, except himſelf, who did not approve the choice, and place the firmeſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in his integrity and abilities <note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſomewhat ſingular, that even in England not one reflexion was ever caſt, or the leaſt diſreſpectful word uttered againſt him.</note>. He arrived at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge in New England, in July 1775, and there took the ſupreme command of the armies of America. He was receive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the camp with that heart-felt exultation which ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior merit can alone inſpire, after having in his progreſs through the ſeveral ſtates received every mark of affection and eſteem, which they conceived were due to the man, whom the whole continent looked up to for ſafety and freedom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:017436_0022_0FA11FDC728DC9A8"/>As he always refuſed to accept of any pecuniary appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for his public ſervices, no ſalary has been annexed by Congreſs to his important command, and he only draws weekly for the expences of his public table and other neceſſary demands. General Waſhington having never been in Europe, could not poſſibly have ſeen much military ſervice when the armies of Britain were ſent to ſubdue us; yet ſtill, for a variety of reaſons, he was by much the moſt proper man on this continent, and probably any where elſe, to be placed at the head of an American army. The very high eſtimation he ſtood in for integrity and honour, his engaging in the cauſe of his country from ſentiment and a conviction of her wrongs, his moderation in politics, his extenſive property, and his approved abilities as a commander, were motives which neceſſarily obliged the choice of America to fall upon him. That nature has given him extraordinary military talents will hardly be controverted by his moſt bitter ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and having been early actuated with a warm paſſion to ſerve his country in the military line, he has greatly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them by unwearied induſtry, and a cloſe application to the beſt writers upon tactics, and by a more than common method and exactneſs: and, in reality, when it comes to be conſidered that at firſt he only headed a body of men intirely unacquainted with military diſcipline or operations, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ungovernable in temper, and who at beſt could only be ſtiled an alert and good militia, acting under very ſhort en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtments, uncloathed, unaccoutred, and at all times very ill ſupplied with ammunition and artillery; and that with ſuch an army he withſtood the ravages and progreſs of near forty
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017436_0023_0FA11FDE5D471A18"/>
thouſand veteran troops, plentifully provided with every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary article, commanded by the braveſt officers in Europe, and ſupported by a very powerful navy, which effectually prevented all movements by water; when, I ſay, all this comes to be impartially conſidered, I think I may venture to pronounce, that general Waſhington will be regarded by man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as one of the greateſt military ornaments of the preſent age, and that his name will command the veneration of the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p>I would not mention to you the perſon of this excellent man, were I not convinced that it bears great analogy to the qualifications of his mind. General Waſhington is now in the forty-ſeventh year of his age; he is a tall well-made man, rather large boned, and has a tolerably genteel addreſs: his features are manly and bold, his eyes of a blueiſh caſt and very lively; his hair a deep brown, his face rather long and marked with the ſmall pox, his complexion ſun-burnt and without much colour, and his countenance ſenſible, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, and thoughtful; there is a remarkable air of dignity about him, with a ſtriking degree of gracefulneſs: he has an excellent underſtanding without much quickneſs; is ſtrictly juſt, vigilant, and generous; an affectionate huſband, a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful friend, a father to the deſerving ſoldier; gentle in his manners, in temper rather reſerved; a total ſtranger to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious prejudices, which have ſo often excited Chriſtians of one denomination to cut the throats of thoſe of another; in his morals irreproachable; he was never known to exceed the bounds of the moſt rigid temperance: In a word, all his
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017436_0024_0FA11FDEB4B86A08"/>
friends and acquaintance univerſally allow, that no man ever united in his own perſon a more perfect alliance of the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of a philoſopher with the talents of a general. Candour, ſincerity, affability and ſimplicity, ſeem to be the ſtriking fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of his character, till an occaſion offers of diſplaying the moſt determined bravery and independence of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Such, my good friend, is the man, to whom America has intruſted her important cauſe. Hitherto ſhe has had every reaſon to be ſatisfied with her choice; and moſt ungrateful would ſhe be to the great Diſpoſer of human events, were ſhe not to render him unremitting thanks for having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided her with ſuch a citizen at ſuch a criſis. Moſt nations have been favoured with ſome patriotic deliverer: the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites had their Moſes; Rome had her Camillus; Greece her Leonidas; Sweden her Guſtavus; and England her Hambdens, her Ruſſels, and her Sydneys; but theſe illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious heroes, though ſucceſsful in preſerving and defending, did not, like Waſhington, form or eſtabliſh empires, which will be the refuge or aſylum of Liberty baniſhed from Europe by luxury and corruption. Muſt not therefore, your heart beat with conſcious pride at the proſpect of your friend's being ranked among (if not above) thoſe illuſtrious patriots? at the enchanting thought, that He, whom you know and love, ſhall be acknowledged by preſent and future generations as their great deliverer, and the chief inſtrument in the hands of the Almighty for laying the foundation of that freedom and happineſs, which, I truſt, await the future myriads of this vaſt continent?</p>
