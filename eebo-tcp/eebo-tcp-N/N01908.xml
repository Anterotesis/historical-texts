            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN the <hi>Eight Miniſters</hi> who at this time carry on the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient and famous <hi>Thurſday-Lecture</hi> of <hi>BOSTON,</hi> agreed upon Preaching <hi>Eight Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> on the Nature, and Methods, and Motives, of EARLY PIETY, I did with Satisfaction Look on this their Agreement as a Motion from GOD; And I could <hi>have no Greater Joy,</hi> than to ſee <hi>my Children thus Walking in the Truth,</hi> and ſo zealous to Invite and Perſwade the Children of their People, to <hi>Chuſe the Way of Truth,</hi> and <hi>Walk with the GOD of their Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THEY have ſollicited a Line or two, from my

            <p>PIETY, or, the Return of a Soul to GOD in His CHRIST, and a <hi>Godly,</hi> and <hi>Sober,</hi> and <hi>Righteous</hi> Life led upon it, is the <hi>whole Duty,</hi> and Intereſt, and Wiſdom of Man; And the more <hi>Early</hi> the <hi>Piety,</hi> the Greater the Wiſdom and Comfort and Glory of them that come into it. <hi>Theſe are Things that cannot be Spoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I therefore do Recommend this Book, of <hi>Early Piety,</hi> not only unto the <hi>Young People</hi> in the Country, but alſo unto their <hi>Parents;</hi> Adviſing them to Recommend it unto their Families, and make it accompany the <hi>Charges</hi> which they Lay upon their Children, to <hi>know and Serve the GOD of their Fathers.</hi>

I wiſh it were no other than the Weakneſs of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race</hi>'s old Man, the <hi>Laudator Temporis acti,</hi> when I complain that there is a Grievous <hi>Decay of Piety</hi> in the Land; and a <hi>Leaving of the Firſt Love:</hi> And that the <hi>Beauties of Holineſs</hi> are not to be ſeen in our Churches, as once they were: A <hi>Fruitful Chriſtian,</hi> grown too Rare a Spectacle: Yea, too many are <hi>Given to Change,</hi> and Leave that <hi>Order of the Goſpel,</hi> to Sett up and uphold which, was the very Deſign of theſe Colonies: And the very Intereſt of <hi>NEW-ENG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAND</hi> ſeems to be <hi>Changed</hi> from a <hi>Religious</hi> to a <hi>Worldly</hi> Intereſt. On which Accounts, it is to be feared, that awful <hi>changes</hi> are further coming on the Country; and that the Holy SON of GOD, offended at the Apoſtaſy, may order for it, a deep ſhare in the <hi>Cup of Trembling,</hi> which He is now upon giving to the Sinful Nations. I muſt <hi>Weep,</hi> and I now do it <hi>with a Loud Voice,</hi> for what I ſee. <hi>Oh! That my Head were Waters, &amp; my Eyes a Fountain of Tears!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOTHING will contribute ſo much, to avert the Evil <hi>Tokens,</hi> at which <hi>they who dwell in the Wilderneſs</hi> may be <hi>afraid;</hi> as a Revival of <hi>PIETY,</hi> Even of <hi>EARLY PIETY,</hi> in the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Generation.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002256_0004_0FDADD3799B65238"/>of <hi>Parents,</hi> To <hi>ſee their Children Happy.

            </p>
            <p>I Remember that on a Coin of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour <hi>Conſtans,</hi> which we have in our Hands, there is the Emperour drawing a <hi>Youth</hi> after him, and thoſe Words about him, <hi>Faelix Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Reparatio:</hi> Intimating, That for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of the Times, <hi>Youth</hi> is Principally to be dealt withal. Senſible of This, the mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of your <hi>Lectures,</hi> propoſe now a <hi>Sett of Sermons</hi> on EARLY PIETY; Hoping in, and Waiting on Heaven, to give an Efficacy to them.</p>
            <p>WE find the Illuſtrious <hi>David</hi> a little before he died, very Sollicitous about the Welfare of the <hi>Son,</hi> that was to Survive him, and Succeed him; To have the Son, whom his own Eyes, and the Eyes of the People were much upon, <hi>Do worthily</hi> after he ſhould be Dead.</p>
            <p>BEHOLD, Firſt, The <hi>Method</hi> which is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a <hi>Father full of Goodneſs,</hi> that ſo he might have an <hi>Happy Son,</hi> and a <hi>Son</hi> that
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002256_0004_0FDADD3799B65238"/>ſhould be like him. He <hi>Prays</hi> for the <hi>Son:</hi> He carries him to GOD; he commits him to GOD; he intreats GOD Mercifully to take Notice of him. No <hi>Method</hi> like to This.</p>
            <p>BUT then, Behold, Secondly, The <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to be ſought in this <hi>Method;</hi> the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> which alone makes an <hi>Happy Son.</hi> A <hi>Perfect Heart</hi> is that <hi>Bleſſing.</hi> A <hi>Perfect Heart</hi> is here deſired for a <hi>Solomon:</hi> A Thing enough to make an Happy <hi>Solomon!</hi> I obſerve by the way an Hebrew Elegancy in the Original. The Name of <hi>Solomon</hi> is derived from that Word that Signifies, <hi>To be Perfect,</hi> as well as to be <hi>Peaceable;</hi> and the very Word that is uſed here. It is, q. d. <q>Lord, make my <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> a Real <hi>Solomon,</hi> give to my <hi>Solomon</hi> the Heart of a <hi>Solomon,</hi> let the <hi>Heart</hi> as well as the <hi>Name</hi> of my <hi>Son,</hi> have that <hi>Perfection,</hi> which will have <hi>Peace</hi> Entail'd upon it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I am again to tell you, That a <hi>Pious Mind,</hi> is the Thing to be Underſtood by a <hi>Perfect Heart.</hi> And this is the DOCTRINE which now very ſtrongly demands a devout Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>THE PIOUS MIND, of a PERFECT HEART will make Bleſſed CHILDREN: And PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RENTS ought fervently to pour out their Prayer unto the GOD of all Grace, to pour down ſuch a Bleſſing upon their Children.</hi>

I. IT will be proper, in the Firſt place, to declare, what that <hi>Bleſſing</hi> is, which being found in our <hi>Children,</hi> they will be <hi>known to be an Offspring which the Lord has Bleſſed. Children,</hi> It is a <hi>Perfect Heart</hi> that muſt be found in you, if you would not incur the Doom of <hi>curſed Children.</hi> But I am again, and again, to tell you, that a <hi>Pious Mind</hi> is that <hi>Perfect Heart.</hi> A Principle of PIETY in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into the <hi>Heart,</hi> is that which will make it a <hi>Perfect Heart.</hi> We do not Expect from you an <hi>abſolute perfection,</hi> which the <hi>heart</hi> of no Man in this World may pretend unto; or an <hi>Heart perfectly,</hi> compleatly, exactly, and in all points Conformed unto the Law of GOD, which no Man in this World has attain'd un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to.

            <p>WHEREFORE, Firſt, O Children, If you would be owned for Children of a <hi>perfect heart,</hi> you muſt make ſure, of an <hi>Hearty,</hi> Real, Thorough <hi>Converſion</hi> unto GOD. You read of ſuch an Excellent Thing as that; Ezek. XXXVI. 26. <hi>A new heart will I give you.</hi> This <hi>New Heart</hi> will be a <hi>Perfect</hi> One. A <hi>Changed Heart,</hi> a <hi>Cleanſed Heart,</hi> an <hi>Heart</hi> with a <hi>New Biaſs</hi> upon it; an <hi>Heart</hi> no longer ſet upon the <hi>Vanities</hi> of the World; an <hi>Heart</hi> wherein GOD reſumes His <hi>Throne,</hi> and <hi>Idols</hi> are dethroned, and GOD has the Regards paid unto Him, which have heretofore been Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully paid unto <hi>Creatures;</hi> This is the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Heart.</hi> An <hi>heart</hi> filled with the <hi>Love</hi> of GOD, and ſet above all Things, to chuſe and to do the Things that <hi>pleaſe</hi> Him; an <hi>Heart</hi> filled with the <hi>Love</hi> of CHRIST, and cloſing with Him in all His <hi>Offices,</hi> and Feeding and Living on the <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of which there is <hi>All</hi> in Him; an <hi>Heart</hi> filled with the <hi>Love</hi> which is due to <hi>Mankind,</hi> and which will make one <hi>do as he would be done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>SECONDLY; As we would bring out <hi>Children</hi> to a <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of PIETY, ſo we would Exhort them to <hi>Sincerity</hi> in their <hi>Profeſſion, Children,</hi> Get a <hi>Sincere Heart,</hi> and you will have a <hi>Perfect Heart.

Children, you muſt <hi>Walk as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD,</hi> wherever you come. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal, both do that which is <hi>Right;</hi> and have a <hi>Right Aim</hi> in your doing of it.

            <p>THIRDLY. We cannot be ſatisfied, Except our <hi>Children</hi> Endeavour an <hi>univerſal Obedience</hi> unto GOD. What is a <hi>perfect heart?</hi> A <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> even <hi>one of a thouſand,</hi> ſhall be our <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter.</hi> Says he, <hi>'Tis to keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, even to do all theſe Things. Children,</hi> You will <hi>be</hi> before GOD, what you <hi>Deſire,</hi> and <hi>Study,</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> to be. A <hi>Perfect Heart,</hi> and a <hi>Perfection</hi> of <hi>Obedience</hi> to God, is to be mightily and conſtantly Endeavoured with you. You have thoſe two together, 1 Chron. XXVIII. 9. <hi>My ſon, know thou the God of thy father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart, and a willing mind.</hi> Your <hi>heart</hi> will be <hi>perfect</hi> if your <hi>Mind</hi> be <hi>Willing,</hi> to be, and to do, all that you find GOD enjoyning upon you. A Young Perſon willing to be <hi>perfect and intire, lacking of nothing</hi> in his <hi>Obedience</hi> to GOD; willing and wiſhing to be made <hi>perfect in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very good Work, doing the Will of God;</hi> willing

            </p>
            <p>Finally, O, our Children, Being thus diſpoſed for PIETY, and Reſolved for the ways of GOD, we muſt have you <hi>fixed</hi> in your Holy <hi>Reſolutions,</hi> with an Humble Dependence on your SAVIOUR, for the Aids of His Grace.

This <hi>Fixed Heart,</hi> will be a <hi>Perfect Heart.</hi> You muſt not only <hi>Begin</hi> well, but <hi>Hold</hi> on, and <hi>Hold out,</hi> unto the <hi>End.</hi> A <hi>Pious Mind</hi> will be ſure to do ſo; will with a <hi>Patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in Well-doing, lay hold on Eternal Life.</hi> The Apoſtaſy of <hi>Solomon</hi> was very diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the <hi>Perfect Heart</hi> which the <hi>Prayer</hi> of his <hi>Father</hi> beg'd on his behalf.

II.

            </p>
            <p>THIRDLY. If your <hi>Children</hi> remain deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of a <hi>perfect heart,</hi> their Condition is, how Deplorable, how Deplorable, how beyond all Expreſſion <hi>Miſerable! Parents,</hi> can you ſee your <hi>Children</hi> in a Slavery to the <hi>powers of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>ſerving divers Luſts,</hi> worſe of it than any Slaves on the Coaſt of <hi>Barbary,</hi> and

Can you ſee your <hi>Children</hi> faſt aſleep in an <hi>Houſe on Fire</hi> over their heads; and not fly with Agony to help them out of the Flames! This is their very Condition. And nothing, I ſay unto you, nothing but a <hi>Perfect Heart</hi> brought into them, can Save them out of it. Strangers to a <hi>perfect heart,</hi> they <hi>Dye in their Sins;</hi> Dye, ſo that it had been <hi>Good for them, they had never been born.</hi> Be you and your <hi>Children</hi> what you will, if they never have a <hi>perfect heart</hi> produced in them, the Great GOD ſays upon them, as in Amos IX. 7. <hi>Are ye not as Children of the Ethiopians unto me, ſaith the Lord!</hi> Yea, becauſe in the <hi>Church-ſtate</hi> you have them <hi>Lifted up to Heaven,</hi> their Damnation will be more Dreadful, and a Deeper and Hotter Hell will be aſſign'd unto them, than what ſhall be inflicted on the <hi>Children of Ethiopians.</hi> Your <hi>Children,</hi> have upon them the <hi>ſpots</hi> that ſhow they are <hi>not the Children of GOD,</hi> until a <hi>perfect heart</hi> have taken away thoſe Ugly and Filthy <hi>ſpots.</hi> But then whoſe are they? The <hi>heart</hi> of your <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> has in it, the <hi>ſeeds</hi> of Eternal <hi>Death,</hi> the <hi>Worms</hi> that will never <hi>Dye.</hi> The Diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the <hi>Carnal Mind</hi> of your <hi>Children,</hi> are ſuch, that they <hi>cannot pleaſe GOD</hi> in them: They are full of <hi>Enmity to GOD.</hi> The Holy GOD can be no other but a <hi>Conſuming Fire</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002256_0011_0FDADD4B27A65078"/>unto them, until they have an <hi>Heart</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe Diſpoſed. GOD will be <hi>Terrible</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> to them in His Holy <hi>places;</hi> yea, Fearful to be ſpoken! The <hi>Holy places</hi> themſelves can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be <hi>Terrible,</hi> uneaſy, ungrateful to them; they will not be able to breath in ſo pure an Element. Nothing but a <hi>perfect heart</hi> can Save them from the <hi>Wrath to come.</hi> They are Fuel for the <hi>Devouring Fire</hi> and the <hi>Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Burnings,</hi> until a <hi>perfect heart</hi> has giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en another Temper to them. Oh! If you would not have theſe <hi>Children</hi> caſt into the <hi>place of Dragons,</hi> or would not yourſelves be <hi>ſuch</hi> unto them, you muſt be in pain to get a <hi>perfect heart</hi> into them. They are undone, <hi>undone;</hi>—Till this be done for them.</p>
            <p>FOURTHLY. The <hi>perfect heart,</hi> which is the ONE THING to be <hi>Deſired</hi> for your <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> and what ſhould be <hi>ſought after;</hi> Where is it? Whence comes it? Who gives it? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, none but the <hi>GOD of all Grace</hi> can give it. It is the Glorious GOD, who ſays, Ezek. XXXVI. 26. <hi>A new heart will I give you.</hi> If we could our ſelves give a <hi>perfect heart</hi> unto our <hi>Children,</hi> and fill their <hi>Heart</hi> with the <hi>Love</hi> of their GOD and their Neighbour, and a <hi>Zeal</hi> to do Good, what Virtuous <hi>Parents</hi> would not preſently do it with all their Heart? <hi>Lord, It ſhould be the Firſt Thing that we would preſently do for our Children;</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> 
               <hi>make them Thy Children.</hi> But it is Beyond us. It is Above us. A very Diſtinguiſhing ſtroke
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002256_0011_0FDADD4B27A65078"/>and beat of a <hi>perfect heart</hi> is, a <hi>Faith</hi> in the only SAVIOUR; a Flight unto Him for His <hi>Great Salvation.</hi> But whoſe <hi>Gift</hi> is this! We are told, Eph. II. 8. <hi>Faith is the Gift of God.</hi> And ſo, we are elſe-where told more than once, That <hi>GOD gives Repentance.</hi> A <hi>perfect heart,</hi> which is always a very <hi>Tender</hi> one; 'tis a <hi>Stone</hi> turn'd into <hi>Fleſh.</hi> Who but the Almighty GOD can do ſuch a Thing as that? <hi>Create in us a clean heart,</hi> O our GOD. It is a <hi>Creating Work,</hi> to make a <hi>perfect heart.</hi> None but GOD the <hi>Creator</hi> of all things, can do ſuch a Thing. <hi>This is my Glory, ſaith the Lord, and my Glory I will not give unto a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fifthly. PRAYER, PRAYER, to the <hi>GOD of all Grace,</hi> is not this the Way to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Gift?</hi> By pouring out your <hi>Prayer</hi> to a Gracious GOD for it, you may obtain of Him. So we are taught, concerning the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of a <hi>perfect heart;</hi> Ezek. XXXVI. 27. <hi>I will be enquired of on the behalf of the houſe of Iſrael, to do it for them.</hi> [It ſhould be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſo.] When <hi>Parents</hi> do with unceaſing Fervour implore our Good GOD, that He would pleaſe to do this <hi>Good</hi> unto their <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;</hi> To <hi>make them Good, and upright in Heart;</hi> it is a ſign, that He will at ſome time or other do it for them. Our Good GOD is willing to beſtow the Grace of a <hi>Perfect Heart,</hi> when He is asked for it. Nay, there is no Caſe, wherein that Word is oftner fulfill'd, than it
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002256_0012_0FDADD4C8E078998"/>is in This; <hi>Ask, and it ſhall be given you.</hi> Not is there any <hi>Prayer</hi> more grateful unto GOD, than This. <hi>Parents,</hi> There is nothing for which you can go to GOD with more of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement and Expectation; <hi>O Do Thou give a perfect Heart unto this Child; The Heart of thy Children; O my GOD.</hi> I can lead you to a Word, worth more than a Rock of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds, or a Mountain of Gold! It is that Word, Luk. XI. 13. <hi>If you that are Evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more ſhall your Heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit unto them that ask Him?</hi> What a raviſhing Word is This! <hi>Quicken'd</hi> by it, Oh, Go now to your <hi>Heavenly Father,</hi> not only for your ſelves, but alſo for your Children. With Tears beg it of Him; <hi>O my Father, I long, I long for it, That my Children may be thy Servants. O my SAVIOUR, if Thou will allow of it, the Deſcent of thy Holy SPIRIT upon them will make them ſo. O my GOD, Let thy Good SPIRIT lead them into the Land of Rectitude O SPIRIT of Grace, do thou take poſſeſſion of them.</hi> 'Tis very certain, That if GOD give His <hi>Holy SPIRIT</hi> unto your <hi>Children,</hi> the <hi>Holy SPIRIT</hi> will give a <hi>perfect heart</hi> unto them. The Holy SPIRIT will <hi>Renew a right Spirit</hi> in them; will <hi>Purify their Heart</hi> by a <hi>Faith</hi> of His Working there; will make them the <hi>Temples</hi> of GOD. The Holy SPIRIT will <hi>write his Laws</hi> in their Heart, and <hi>Rectify</hi> all Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders there, &amp; bring all things to rights with in them. Yea, as we Read, That when the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002256_0012_0FDADD4C8E078998"/>SPIRIT firſt fell on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators <hi>were aſtoniſhed</hi> at what they ſaw: The Holy SPIRIT falling on your <hi>Children,</hi> you will ſee Things done for them, that will fill you with <hi>Astoniſhment;</hi> but, Oh! What Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction! Oh! What Conſolation! <hi>Ask, Ask,</hi> and ſee what will be done for you.</p>
            <p>BUT then, it muſt be Remembred, That your <hi>Prayer</hi> for the Renovation of your Children, and their <hi>thus paſſing from Death to Life,</hi> muſt have Two Concomitants.</p>
            <p>Firſt; YOUR SAVIOUR has told you, That <hi>Men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</hi> Your <hi>Prayers</hi> for your <hi>Children</hi> muſt be, Oh! how Importunate; — ſuch as compaſſionate Heaven uſes to give no Denial to! <hi>Prayers, and Supplications, with ſtrong Crying, and Tears,</hi> to Him that is <hi>Able to Save</hi> your Children from the <hi>Death,</hi> which you are <hi>Afraid</hi> will <hi>feed</hi> upon them! Oh! Plead with a Compaſſionate GOD, as a Soul <hi>Wreſtling</hi> with Him, and <hi>Weeping</hi> in <hi>Supplications,</hi> that will humbly proteſt, <hi>Lord, I will not let thee go, except Thou Bleſs the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and put thy fear into them!</hi> Humbly Plead with Him His <hi>Promiſe,</hi> and ſhew Him His own <hi>Hand-Writing;</hi> Even that Word, on which He has <hi>cauſed you to hope;</hi> Iſai. XLIV. 3. <hi>I will pour my Spirit upon thy ſeed, and my Bleſſing upon thine offſpring.</hi> Do thus, until the <hi>New-born-Child</hi> ſhall be called a SAMUEL, and you may ſay, <hi>I have asked him and gained him of the Lord.</hi> But then, The <hi>Importunity</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:002256_0013_0FDADD4E06B55C88"/>of your <hi>Prayers</hi> muſt eſpecially be expreſſed in the <hi>Perpetuity</hi> of them. The <hi>Mercy</hi> of ſeeing your <hi>Children turned from Darkneſs unto Light, and from the power of Satan unto GOD</hi> perhaps will not be preſently granted you Nay, you may ſee, as in the Grant of every <hi>Special Mercy</hi> it uſes to be, a <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> long written upon it, before you receive it.

When <hi>Eliſha</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for a <hi>Double Portion</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> that had been in his Predeceſſor, <hi>Elijah</hi> told him, that if he <hi>ſaw him</hi> at his mounting up to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> he ſhould have it. This may be, and has been, ſo far alluded to; Oh! if your <hi>Children</hi> may ſee you going to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and may ſee the <hi>Heavenly Flights</hi> of your Souls, in your Contempt of <hi>Earth,</hi> your Horror at <hi>Sin,</hi> your Value for CHRIST, and your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with GOD; there would probably fall upon them, a <hi>Mighty Portion</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> which you deſire for them; the <hi>Spirit</hi> of PIETY, which you have deſired for them.</p>

               <p n="2">2. <hi>YOU muſt therefore give up your ſelves to God</hi> for ever.</p>
               <p>GOD will have you for His own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; or not at all. He would have you be in an Eternal Subjection to Him. He would have you be the Eternal active Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of His Glory and Honour. God would have you yield Eternal Adoration to Him. He would have you to be the Eternal Objects of His Delight and Love: and He would have you to be forever Happy in the Service and Injoyment of Him.</p>
               <p>YOU muſt therefore give up your ſelves and all you have to God, <hi>for ever.</hi> You muſt make ſuch an abſolute Devotion of yourſelves to God; as never to have the leaſt pretence or right, to free your ſelves again. You muſt give up yourſelves intirely to God in an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Covenant, never to be broken. And this <hi>O Children</hi> you muſt do in your Early Days.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>YOU muſt give up your ſelves to God</hi> in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>CHILDREN! out of Chriſt God wont accept you. God has indeed an unalienable Right and Propriety in you: you muſt needs be His own forever: and He will Eternally uſe you for His Glory. But out of Chriſt
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002256_0071_0FDAC978D8985360"/>He'l ſurely make you the miſerable Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the dreadful Glory of His Power and Juſtice; and not the happy Inſtruments of the Glory of His Grace and Mercy. You are both by Life and Nature moſt abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and guilty Sinners; and out of Chriſt God utterly abhors you and is angry with you; He can't accept, He can't Forgive you, He cannot be Reconciled to you. But in Chriſt His Son, our Mediator, and in Chriſt alone, God is Reconcileable to ſuch ſinful Children, and He is ready to Forgive you and Receive you. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18, 19.</p>
               <p>YOU muſt therefore give your ſelves to God in Chriſt; or He'l caſt you off. You muſt in the firſt place go to Chriſt the Son of God and your Mediator. You muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent and give your ſelves to Chriſt; that He may give you unto God. You muſt plead with Chriſt to Accept and take you for His own: and you muſt not doubt but He'l receive you; ſince He was ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd with thoſe that hinder'd Children from coming to Him, and ſaid let them come, <hi>for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God,</hi> Mar. 10.13,—16.</p>
               <p>CHILDREN, you muſt not therefore Doubt but Chriſt will Accept and Bleſs you upon your coming and giving up yourſelves unto Him. And then in Chriſt, you may with an holy Confidence give up your ſelves to God. Chriſt will become your Mediator; and in Bleſſing you, He'l take away the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002256_0071_0FDAC978D8985360"/>guilt and curſe of Sin, He'l purge you from it, and He'l make you thro' His Blood a moſt acceptable offering unto God. Chriſt will readily introduce you to Him: He'l be pleas'd to make ſuch a Preſent unto God, and God Himſelf will be pleaſed to Receive it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. AND Laſtly, <hi>YOU muſt thus give your ſelves to God</hi> with all your Hearts.</p>
               <p>THIS Giving up yourſelves to God muſt not be a meer formal action; but it muſt be an hearty Offering and Devoting of yourſelves to God. It muſt be Done in the Heart, and from thence it muſt Proceed; or God will not Regard you. Your Hearts muſt be given up to God: Or you are not intire or ſincere in your Devotion to Him. And if you give up yourſelves to God, without your Hearts approving and concurring; your Offering is but the Sacrifice of Hypocrites, which is an abomination to Him.</p>
               <p>NO! your <hi>Hearts</hi> are the Principal and moſt Peculiar Things which God Regards; and they indeed include and contain all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. The Preacher therefore does not ſay the <hi>Hand</hi> or <hi>Head,</hi> but <hi>Heart;</hi> Becauſe by the Poſſeſſion of the Heart God has all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Soul and Body devoted to Him; and without the Heart God values not the Reſt. To give to God an Outward ſhow of Piety, is but a mocking of Him, unleſs your Hearts go with it. Give your Hearts, and you give Him all: Give Him not your Hearts,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002256_0072_0FDADDC0CD0A0728"/>and you really give Him nothing, whatever elſe you ſeem to give Him.</p>
               <p>YOU muſt be ſincere and hearty therefore in your giving up yourſelves; or you Do not Truly give yourſelves to God. You only make an Outward ſhow: But God Beholds your ſecret Enmity and Averſion to Him. You muſt not only give up yourſelves intirely and forever to Him; But you muſt alſo do it without Reluctance. You muſt do it freely, and with full conſent of Soul. In Fine, you muſt ſet your Heart and higheſt Love on God: And from your higheſt Eſteem of God and your earneſt Deſire to Injoy and Serve Him you muſt Give your ſelves unto Him.</p>
               <p>AND thus have I briefly ſhown you what it is to <hi>give up your Hearts to God:</hi> And this you muſt take care to do in your Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Age. This is your firſt and great and moſt incumbent Duty. You muſt not allow yourſelves to Live an Hour, no not a Moment till you have given yourſelves to God. As ſoon as you were capable of Knowing Him you ſhould have given yourſelves to Him And if you have not done it yet; you muſt do it now, and without the leaſt Delay.</p>
               <p>AND in order to convince you of this moſt incumbent Duty, we now Proceed more large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Conſider.</p>
               <p>Secondly. <hi>WHAT are thoſe</hi> Great &amp; Solemn OBLIGATIONS <hi>you are under thus to give your ſelves to God in your Early Days.</hi>
               </p>

IT is very likely many of you Think, that this is a matter of very great Indifference. Multitudes among you ſeem to think ſo, by your lewd ungodly Lives, and by your light and vain Behaviour in the Houſe of God. You ſeem to think as if you were not under any <hi>Obligations</hi> to be Religious in your Youthful Age. Or at leaſt you think, your <hi>Obligations</hi> are but trifling things, and of little Force and Moment. Many of you ſeem to be intirely careleſs whether you give your Hearts to God or no. You exceedingly neglect Him, and you rather ſet your ſelves againſt Him: You give up your Hearts to Earthly Things and Pleaſures, and to Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts and Vanities, and not to God. Alas, you little think what Great and Solemn <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations</hi> are lying on you to Devote your Hearts to God in your Early Days!</p>
               <p>YOUR <hi>Obligations</hi> are the moſt <hi>Great and Solemn</hi> that can be Tho't of: And if you be'nt Obliged to give your ſelves to God, you are obliged to nothing. And your <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations</hi> are ſo <hi>exceeding numerous,</hi> that I cannot mention nor conceive them all: nor can I now expreſs a thouſandth part of thoſe I might conceive: For I can Think of Nothing, but it is an <hi>Obligation</hi> on you to be Religious.</p>
               <p>EVERY <hi>Attribute</hi> of God is an Obligation on you to give your ſelves unto Him. Every <hi>Work</hi> of God you ſee, preſents an Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to you. Every <hi>Mercy</hi> you receive, and every <hi>Affliction</hi> which you meet with; yea
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002256_0073_0FDADDBF42FDCEE0"/>every Good and every Evil which you hear of in the World. Every Thing contained in the <hi>Word</hi> of God; and every Thing you <hi>Have,</hi> or are able to Do for God is an <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> on you to give your ſelves unto Him.</p>
               <p>BUT I muſt confine my ſelf to a Few.</p>

               <p n="1">1. <hi>HE is</hi> moſt Glorious and Perfect in Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: <hi>and therefore you are Obliged to give your Hearts unto Him in your Early Days.</hi>

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002256_0073_0FDADDBF42FDCEE0"/>for Himſelf alone, and in ſubordination to Himſelf, for other Things.</p>
               <p>GOD is abſolutely Perfect: a moſt Pure Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; without Body, Parts or Paſſions, and Free from all Compoſition. And you have alſo Learnt; that He is Infinite, Eternal and Unchangeable in His Being, Wiſdom, Power, Holineſs, Juſtice, Goodneſs and Truth. God is without Beginning, and He can never have an End. He is Immenſe and Omnipre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. He is always preſent in every Place; and He always views every Thing Preſent, Future, Paſt and Poſſible. God is Omniſcient alſo, i. e. He always ſees and knows whatever has been, is, and will come to Paſs. Yea, God intirely ſees whatever might have been, and whatever can be. He is an All-wiſe and All-mighty Being. He is immutably the ſame from Everlaſting to Everlaſting. He is Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, Supream and Sovereign, Self-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, All-ſufficient, and in Himſelf alone is Infinitely happy.</p>

               </p>
               <p>GOD alone is infinite in all Perfections: He has an infinite ſource of Goodneſs in Him. He is the only Living and Self-Exiſtent Being: and therefore He is the Infinite and Sovereign Fountain of Being, Life and Goodneſs unto others. And as God is Infinite in Life and Goodneſs; ſo He is Infinitely, Bountiful and Liberal. He is an Eternal Fountain full and overflowing, and that can never be exhauſted or diminiſhed. As God can make you to Live for ever; ſo He is freely communicative of Eternal Life unto you. He is infinitely exuberant in Goodneſs and Happineſs: and He is more full and abounding in them to you
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002256_0074_0FDADDC24CA021C8"/>than the <hi>Sun</hi> itſelf in warmth or Light unto the World.</p>
               <p>HOW much are you then obliged to give your hearts to Him, who is the only Infinite and Sovereign Fountain of Life and Goodneſs. They all depend upon his Sovereign Will and Pleaſure, and from him they muſt proceed. To be ſure you all deſire to live for ever and be happy: and how inconſiſtent is it to refuſe your hearts to Him from whom alone they flow? But this brings us to the Second Head. viz.</p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>GOD has</hi> made All Things <hi>for His own</hi> Glory <hi>and He has made</hi> You <hi>to</hi> Glorify and Enjoy Him for ever: <hi>and therefore you are Obliged to give your Hearts to God in your Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Argument and Obligation riſes from your Creation and the Ends thereof. And ſurely this is the moſt inviolable Obligation on you to give your ſelves to God; from whom you have intirely received your very Life and Being, and that you may thereby anſwer the Ends of them.</p>
               <p>BUT here are theſe <hi>two</hi> Particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>GOD has</hi> made you and all other Things: <hi>and therefore you are Obliged to give your Hearts to God in your Early Days.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WE obſerv'd before that God is the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Fountain of Life and Being: And now, that He is the actual and univerſal Creator. Before He made the World, it intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002256_0075_0FDADDC3C5615D78"/>on His Sovereign Will and Pleaſure whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no to bring it into Being. But firſt He will'd it and ſpake the Word; and then the whole Creation in a moment ſprang from nothing. He brought this lower World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a beautiful Order, and made every Kind of Creature in it in Six Days time. God is the Creator and Former of all things.</p>
               <p>AND God having therefore made all Things in the World, He has an abſolute Right &amp; Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in them. They are the Things of God; And therefore 'tis Juſt and Right they ſhould be Improved for Him. Youth and Children, you are therefore Gods by Right of Creation: And ſo are all other Things in the World. Surely then, you are indiſpenſably oblig'd to Give yourſelves and all you have to God, whoſe Due you are. You muſt be devoted to God, you muſt Live to God, and you muſt improve every Thing for God; or you profanely rob Him of his Right and Due.</p>
               <p>BUT then, as the Crown of all his Works in this World below, He made and formed Man. He formed a moſt beauteous Body of the Duſt of the Earth, and He breathed into it a Soul, a Spirit Immortal. In every ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeſſive Age, as the Children of Men have Dy'd, God has wonderfully made and raiſed up others. How devoutly does the Pſalmiſt admire His Creator for ſo Glorious a Work, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.14 — 18.</p>

               <p>GOD has an abſolute Right to <hi>Govern</hi> the Things he has made, and which he continually upholds by a Sovereign Act of his Power and Wiſdom.

And as God has ſuch a Right, he is infinitely capable of Maintaining and Improving it, according to his Sovereign Pleaſure.

Mic. 6.8. <hi>He hath ſhewed the O man what is good; and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> And as God gives you <hi>Laws,</hi> ſo he Actually <hi>Rules</hi> and Governs you according to his Sovereign Pleaſure.

God has ſent it, Oh Children <hi>to You:</hi> And it is a vaſt addition to your Obligations from your natural Reaſon and Conſcience to be Devoted to God.</p>
               <p>O YOUTH and Children! Here is the Will of the Great and Sovereign GOD expreſly Revealed and Proclaimed to you. And <hi>Every Thing</hi> Revealed in His Word Obliges you to give yourſelves to Him. It is even Firſtly Revealed and Written for this great End and Purpoſe. Pſal. 78.5—7. <hi>For he eſtabliſhed a a teſtimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Iſrael, which He commanded our fathers; that they ſhould make them known to their children: That the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to come might know them, even the children which ſhould be born: which ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe and declare them to their children: That they might ſet their hope in God, and not forget the works of God; but keep his commandments:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN <hi>General,</hi> All the Inſtructions and Truths contained in the Scriptures are both a means and ingagement to Lead you to God. All the Counſels and Exhortations in them: All the Warnings and ſevere Reproofs: All the Commands and Inſtitutions: All the Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Promiſes and Terrible Threatnings: All the Inſtances both of Sin and of Goodneſs, and eſpecially of Early Religion: All the Examples both of Judgment &amp; Mercy: And in Fine, all the
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002256_0087_0FDADDDE08E7F7E0"/>Gracious Invitations and Directions that are given in Scripture, are Deſigned as a means to Bring you to God; and are Great and High Obligations on you to give yourſelves to Him.</p>
               <p>IN <hi>Particular,</hi> GOD therein Expreſly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires and calls you to give up your Hearts to Him in the Time of your Youth. Thus it is Expreſly Required in the <hi>Text:</hi> And ſurely, when God has once Expreſly Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it, 'tis enough to Oblige you: He has Declared His Will, and He need ſay no more.</p>

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:002256_0089_0FDADDE1774C18F0"/>you into it, and to take you into His Gracious and Peculiar Care.</p>
               <p>AND indeed your Parents have offer'd <hi>No more</hi> to God than what was <hi>His own</hi> Before; Being juſt come out of His Creating and Form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hands, and made to ſerve and enjoy Him. But God having made you <hi>Their</hi> Children, the Children of His Covenant People, He would have them to offer you to Him; that <hi>You</hi> might alſo be bro't into the Covenant with them, and have the Benefits of it. If they, had not done it; they had been <hi>Unkind and cruel</hi> as the <hi>Oſtriches</hi> of the Wilderneſs.

But God then pitied you; and your Parents pitied you, and came and offered you to Him. <hi>Here</hi> they bring their poor crying Infants in Swadling Cloaths, to give them up to God. <hi>Men and Angels</hi> look on and behold the Tranſaction.

            <p>THAT which I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour at this Time, by the help of God, is to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our <hi>Young People,</hi> the <hi>peculiar</hi> Benefits and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of <hi>Early</hi> Piety. You have already heard the Duty in the ſeveral great Branches of it <hi>excellently</hi> explained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002256_0093_0FDADDEB879D8DF0"/>you: And your Obligations unto it <hi>Strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> inculcated. That therefore which offers it ſelf next to our Conſideration, is the <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular</hi> Benefits and Advantages of <hi>Remembering our great Creator in the Days of our Youth:</hi> And as this has fal'n to my Lot, I have made choice of theſe Words of <hi>Divine Wiſdom,</hi> as an Introduction to the preſent Diſcourſe. They are found among <hi>the Proverbs of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the Son of David the King of Iſrael.</hi> And as the <hi>general</hi> Deſign of this book (as was excellently obſerved unto you the laſt Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture) was to <hi>form</hi> the Manners of Youth, or to <hi>Teach</hi> them betimes how to <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Serve</hi> God aright; in which their higheſt Wiſdom and Happineſs conſiſts: So I take this to be the more <hi>particular</hi> Deſign of the Words now read unto you. This ſeems to be very evident from the <hi>manner</hi> in which they are deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren: &amp;c.</hi> Theſe Words (as I ſaid before) are the Words of <hi>Divine Wiſdom,</hi> or the Words of JESUS CHRIST, the <hi>Eſſential</hi> Wiſdom of the Father; <hi>in whom are bid all the Treaſures of Wiſdom and Knowledge, (Coloſ.</hi> 2.3.) and they are ſpoken to <hi>Children. Chiefly</hi> to Thoſe that are Children in Years, as well as in Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding. And they contain an <hi>earneſt</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to the moſt <hi>important</hi> Duty, back't with the moſt <hi>forceable</hi> Motive that cou'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> tho't of. The Duty you are exhorted unto is to <hi>hearken now</hi> to the voice of your Great Saviour, i. e. to learn thoſe Leſſons of <hi>Early</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002256_0093_0FDADDEB879D8DF0"/>Piety that you have been already inſtructed in: And to learn them <hi>Now; to day; inſtantly;</hi> without making one <hi>Moments</hi> delay in this matter of infinite Concern. And the Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Encouragement you have unto the Duty, is a moſt gracious Promiſe of <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> in caſe of Obedience, as in the Words to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on — <hi>For bleſſed are they that keep my ways.</hi> The <hi>Original</hi> Word in this place for <hi>bleſſed,</hi> is a moſt <hi>comprehenſive</hi> Term; and as <hi>Criticks</hi> obſerve, includes all kind of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in it. Hence the meaning of theſe Words is, That all Thoſe who <hi>hearken to the voice,</hi> or keep the Commandments of their Great God and Saviour from their Youth up, ſhall be every way bleſſed of Him. They ſhall be bleſſed with all <hi>Outward</hi> Bleſſings as far as is needful for them; but eſpecially <hi>with all ſpiritual Bleſſings, in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> They ſhall be bleſſed both in their Souls and in their Bodies. They ſhall be bleſſed in <hi>this Life,</hi> at <hi>Death,</hi> and <hi>forever</hi> in the World that is to come. They ſhall be very <hi>remarkably</hi> bleſſed in all theſe, and ſuch like reſpects. This, Children, is the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Encouragement you have from theſe Words of your Saviour, to be religious now, in the Days of your Youth.</p>

               <p>BY an <hi>Early</hi> Converſion to God, you'l come <hi>early</hi> into the <hi>Covenant of His Grace;</hi> and ſo <hi>betimes</hi> obtain a Right and Title to all the <hi>great</hi> and <hi>invaluable</hi> Privileges that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it.

               <p n="1">1. EARLY Religion is frequently attended with many <hi>Outward</hi> Privileges and Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in this Life. The Apoſtle Paul obſerves unto us, (in 1 Tim. 4.8.) <hi>That Godlineſs is profitable to all things, having the promiſe of the life that now is, as well as of that which is to come.</hi> And in theſe Words he (no doubt) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to that Promiſe of our Bleſſed Saviour in Mat. 6.33. <hi>Seek firſt the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſs, and all theſe things ſhall be added unto you. All theſe things,</hi> i. e. Food and Raiment and the other neceſſaries and conveniencies of Life, ſpoken of in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Context. And tho' this <hi>Promiſe.</hi> of <hi>Outward</hi> Bleſſings as the Reward of Obedience is not (perhaps) ſo <hi>large</hi> and <hi>extenſive</hi> in theſe <hi>Goſpel</hi> Days, as it was under the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> Diſpenſation: Yet we may <hi>reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly</hi> expect from hence, to be ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002256_0096_0FDADDF00F5A4470"/>Gainers by Godlineſs even in Outward Regards. And the Early Convert has the faireſt Proſpect of any before him, to be a Gainer by it in theſe two Reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1. BY being Religious <hi>betimes</hi> you take the moſt proper and direct Courſe you can to <hi>get</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh</hi> a good Name, Credit and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the World, among all thoſe whoſe <hi>Value</hi> and <hi>Eſteem</hi> is worth a having. True <hi>Piety</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts a <hi>real</hi> Glory to thoſe that embrace it. It inſpires them with ſuch Noble Principles and Virtues that are the diſtinguiſhing Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Ornament of thoſe that have them. Hence it is the wiſe Man obſerves, <hi>That the righteous is more excellent than his neighbour.</hi> (Prov. 12.26.) And among theſe the <hi>Early</hi> Convert has vaſtly the Preheminence. Grace is <hi>beautiful</hi> in all; but it is eminently ſo, in ſuch as are <hi>Godly betimes.</hi> It appears more <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>unmixed</hi> in them. For they have not ſo many of the <hi>Scandalous</hi> out-breakings of Sin and Corruption to <hi>Tarniſh</hi> and <hi>Eclipſe</hi> the Glory of it, as thoſe that make longer Delays in Religion, uſually have. It is therefore the <hi>Crown,</hi> and the <hi>Laurell</hi> of the Youth. <hi>It makes his face to ſhine,</hi> beyond all the Charms of the moſt <hi>ruddy</hi> Complexion: And is a greater Ornament unto him than the <hi>rich<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſt</hi> Pearls, or the moſt <hi>coſtly</hi> Array. Hence all Thoſe who know how to <hi>prize</hi> and <hi>value</hi> Men and Things according to their true worth, will account you, <hi>the Excellent in the Earth. Your Name, will be much ſet by,</hi> by all
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002256_0096_0FDADDF00F5A4470"/>the <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>good,</hi> the <hi>ſober</hi> and <hi>virtuous</hi> that ſhall have any Knowledge of You. And while the <hi>vain</hi> and <hi>extravagant</hi> Youth is the <hi>ſhame</hi> of his Age, and the <hi>Grief</hi> of all that have the beſt Intereſts at Heart, your <hi>godly</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> Rulers and Miniſters, your <hi>pious</hi> and <hi>prudent</hi> Parents and Neighbours will look upon you with Pleaſure and Delight. <hi>Such precious Sons of Zions</hi> (as you'l then be) will in their Eſteem <hi>be comparable to fine gold:</hi> And they'l account you the Riches and Glory of your Country. And as they ſee you grow up and improve in Grace and Virtue, they'l look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you as the hope of future Time; and ſo be able to dye with the greater Comfort in the Proſpect of being ſucceeded by ſuch as are like to do worthily in their Day and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. This is the Honour you'l have from the Saints. And then, as to the reſt of Mankind, tho' their Credit &amp; Eſteem is not ſo much to be regarded; yet ſuch of them as have any of the <hi>Remains</hi> of Morality in them can't but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence</hi> that <hi>Sobriety, Temperance, Wiſdom, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Juſtice, Meekneſs,</hi> &amp;c. that will adorn your Converſation in the World. And even the moſt <hi>profligate</hi> Wretches upon Earth, that are <hi>loſt</hi> not only to <hi>Religion;</hi> but even to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> Honeſty it ſelf; and that are ready upon all other Occaſions to expreſs their <hi>Hatred</hi> againſt you and the ways of Godlineſs; will yet (if they have any <hi>important</hi> affair to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, that requires the Exerciſe of <hi>Moral</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſuch as <hi>Prudence, Juſtice, Integnity, Fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:002256_0097_0FDADDF583119D30"/>&amp;c. in thoſe they Truſt it with;) I ſay, They will ſooner commit it into your Hands then into the Hands of their <hi>merry</hi> Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that are <hi>equally</hi> vicious with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And this is a plain Evidence that undiſguiſed Virtue commands ſecret Reſpect wherever it appears. — And thus <hi>good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding giveth favour in the eyes of men,</hi> Prov. 13.15. Now ſuch an <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> Reputation in the World is the greateſt of all <hi>Outward</hi> Advantages. It will put many an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty into your Hands to <hi>Do</hi> and <hi>Enjoy</hi> good here which otherwiſe you'l certainly <hi>miſs</hi> of. And hence it is Solomon truly obſerves unto us. Prov. 22.1. <hi>A good name is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p n="2">2. THOSE that are Virtuous <hi>betimes</hi> have the moſt <hi>rational</hi> Proſpects before them of coming to the Poſſeſſion and Enjoyment of a <hi>ſufficiency</hi> of the good Things of this Life. There is not only a <hi>Moral</hi> but <hi>Natural</hi> Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, in the Exerciſe of many <hi>Chriſtian</hi> vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, to get and ſecure to ourſelves, as much of this World as our State and Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in it may call for. Solomon obſerves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us in Prov. 10.4. <hi>That the hand of the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent maketh rich; while he that dealeth with a ſlack hand becometh poor.</hi> And then by mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Expences, Temperance, Frugality, and the like, the <hi>Virtuous</hi> Man keeps what the <hi>Idle Spend-thrif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002256_0097_0FDADDF583119D30"/>the right hand of wiſdom; ſo are Riches and Honour</hi> ſaid <hi>to be in her left hand.</hi> (Prov. 3.16.) But ſuppoſe the <hi>Covetous</hi> Worldling ſhould by his <hi>extream</hi> Parſimony, or by <hi>ſparing more than is mete,</hi> by Rapine and Theft, by Bribery, Extortion, Cheating, and the like evil Courſes, amaſs to himſelf a larger Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion then you are ever like to come <hi>fairly</hi> at: Yet herein you'l (undoubtedly) have the Advantage of him. viz.</p>

You'l not only have a <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Civil</hi> Title unto it (which is more then the <hi>cheating</hi> Miſer has:) But you'l have a <hi>Covenant</hi> Right and Title unto it which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>YOUR <hi>Enjoyment,</hi> which is the End of Poſſeſſion, will (in all Probability) be more <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>pleaſant.</hi> You wont have thoſe ſtings of Conſcience, which uſually attend an <hi>ill</hi> gotten Eſtate, and a <hi>guilty</hi> Mind, to eat out the Comfort of what you have. And then beſides, 'Tis likely you may be favoured with a more <hi>healthly</hi> Conſtitution, which is the very ſoul of all Outward Enjoyment. For <hi>Temperance,</hi> and <hi>Frugality</hi> are Friends to to the Health of the Body; while <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, Unchaſtity,</hi> beaſtly <hi>Senſuality, Luxury,</hi> &amp;c.

               </p>
               <p>AND thus, Children, you ſee, that even in <hi>Outward</hi> Reſpects, the <hi>Early</hi> Convert has the

And I have the rather enlarged up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Head, becauſe One great <hi>Objection</hi> which <hi>Young</hi> People have againſt Early Piety, is a groundleſs Conceit that as ſoon as ever they become truly <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Virtuous</hi> they muſt <hi>inſtantly</hi> abandon all that is pleaſant in this World: Whereas if you will but <hi>impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> conſider what has been ſaid it may have to convince you that the Early Convert takes the moſt <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>Rational</hi> Courſe of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="14" facs="unknown:002256_0099_0FDADE128AEBBEF0"/>
1. THE <hi>Early</hi> Convert is bleſt with an <hi>Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Adoption</hi> into the Number of GOD's Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Every one that is Renewed and Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifyed by the Spirit of God, immediately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a Son, a Child of GOD by a moſt <hi>graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Adoption, John 1.12. <hi>But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name.</hi> Hence Thoſe that are <hi>firſt</hi> Converted unto God, have the <hi>peculiar</hi> Honour to be <hi>firſt</hi> inveſted with this Privilege. And how great the Dignity and Advantage of this is will appear if we briefly conſider what it is to <hi>become</hi> a Child of God; and what <hi>diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Privileges ſuch are Favoured withal.</p>
               <p>AND here briefly;</p>
               <p>TO become a Child of GOD is to be taken into the <hi>neareſt</hi> Relation to God that any Creature is capable of. The moſt <hi>glorious</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven have no higher Title than to be called <hi>the ſons of God.</hi> (Job 38.7.) Nay to be called <hi>the ſon of God</hi> in an <hi>appropriate</hi> ſenſe: i. e. to be <hi>the only begotten Son of God — His well beloved Son — the Son of His Love, &amp;c.</hi> is the moſt <hi>intimate</hi> and <hi>exalted</hi> Relation that the <hi>Second Perſon</hi> in the Ever-Bleſſed Trinity ſtands in unto <hi>God the Father.</hi> How amazing then is the infinite Condeſcention of the Great God towards ſuch <hi>ſinful, polluted</hi> Worms of the Duſt as we are, that He ſhould Advance us to the <hi>Dignity</hi> of Children by a gracious Adoption! It is an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour done us, that <hi>ſimply</hi> conſidered, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002256_0099_0FDADE128AEBBEF0"/>greater than if we had been born of a <hi>David,</hi> of a <hi>Solomon,</hi> or of any of the moſt <hi>Splendid</hi> Monarchs that ever ſway'd a Scepter in this World.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, To become a Child of God is to be <hi>made like unto God.</hi> By a gracious Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you'l have the <hi>Image of the Heavenly A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> livelily <hi>enſtampt upon you,</hi> (1 Cor. 15.49.) That Image of His, <hi>which conſiſteth in righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſ and true holineſs,</hi> (Eph. 4.24.) This Image you'l <hi>be changed into from Glory to God, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 'till at length you ſhall <hi>perfectly be transformed into His Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as far as your Nature and Capacity will allow of, (1 Cor. 3.18. 1 John 3.2. compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.) And how glorious is the Dignity of this! To bare a Reſemblance to <hi>earthly</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty makes a <hi>ſplendid</hi> appearance in the Eye of the World. But <hi>unſpeakably</hi> more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the Eyes of GOD, Angels and good Men is the leaſt Saint, <hi>being made a partaker of the Divine Nature,</hi> (2 Pet. 1.4.)</p>
               <p>AND then beſides, To become a Child of God, is to be enabled to live <hi>a Life of God</hi> in this world. Thoſe that are the Children of God are the <hi>Followers</hi> of their Great God and Saviour; and imitate Him in all His <hi>imitable</hi> Perfections. (See <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1.) And this is the moſt noble and divine Life that can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be led by us. For as God is the <hi>Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> of all Excellency and Perfection; ſo a Conformity to His bleſſed Image and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will exceedingly refine our Nature, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002256_0100_0FDAC97D58645E98"/>vaſtly exalt us above the common Level of Mankind. Thus you ſee what it is to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Child of God: And how <hi>honourable</hi> the Relation is.</p>
               <p>AND now the <hi>diſtinguiſhing</hi> Privileges of it are no leſs <hi>wonderful</hi> and <hi>glorious.</hi> For by being a Child of God, You have His <hi>Fatherly</hi> Compaſſions always extended towards you. Pſal. 103.13. <hi>Like as a Father pitieth his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; ſo does the Lord pity them that fear him.</hi> His <hi>watchful</hi> Eye will ever be upon you, His <hi>tender</hi> Care over you, and His <hi>bountiful</hi> Hand open unto you. And then beſides, You may <hi>repair</hi> unto Him at all Times <hi>as Children to their Father.</hi> You may make Him your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge in every Time of Trouble: You may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen all your wants and Griefs unto Him: You may caſt all your Burdens upon Him: And beg all needful ſupplies from Him.

BUT now as to the <hi>Early</hi> Convert, he loſes <hi>comparatively</hi> but little of his Time. He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins his Work in the <hi>Morning</hi> of his Day.

Now the moſt <hi>effectual</hi> courſe you can take in order to this, is to begin <hi>Early</hi> in the Service of God, and to <hi>perſevere</hi> with Diligence in it. For obſerve, if you do but <hi>Devote</hi> your ſelves to God in your <hi>Childhood</hi> and <hi>Youth,</hi> God will put many Opportunities into your hands to ſerve Him, which He won't favour others withal; and He will help you to improve many more which <hi>vain</hi> Youth <hi>forever</hi> careleſly let ſlip. And by this means
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002256_0105_0FDADE020F330978"/>you'l become <hi>Plants of Renown</hi> in the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of God: And the longer He ſpares you in it, the more <hi>of the precious Fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs will you bring forth, which are by Jeſus Chriſt to the Praiſe and Glory of God.</hi> And what a <hi>Diſtinguiſhing</hi> Crown of Honour will this be upon your Heads?

The <hi>Early</hi> Convert is the <hi>Darling</hi> Child in the Kingdom of Grace God has indeed an <hi>aſtoniſhing</hi> Love for all that are <hi>Conformed</hi> in any good Degree, <hi>to the Image of His Son:</hi> but He ſeems to have a very <hi>peculiar diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing</hi> Affection for all thoſe that ſeek and ſerve Him from their Youth up.

And as the <hi>Early</hi> Convert is a <hi>favourite</hi> Child of God; ſo (no doubt) God will make more <hi>ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> diſcoveries of His <hi>Fatherly</hi> Affection unto him.

He will take you more <hi>frequently</hi> into the Chambers of His Delight; and ſhew you more of the Riches and Honours of His Kingdom. He will give you <hi>greater</hi> quiet and tranquility in your own Minds; and a more eſtabliſhed Peace in your Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. He will <hi>multiply</hi> the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt unto you; and ſo <hi>Anoint you with the oyl of joy and gladneſs above your fellows.</hi> And hence you'l <hi>ſit under the ſhadow of your Saviour with greater delight; and his fruit will be ſweeter to your taſte.</hi> You will enjoy <hi>abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant</hi> more of it, and for a longer ſeaſon than others. In a Word, By your <hi>Early Devoting</hi> your ſelves to the <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Service</hi> of God, you will make <hi>wonderful</hi> Improvements in a Life of <hi>Communion</hi> with God, and ſo reap the <hi>firſt Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Heavenly</hi> Canaan in greater plenty while you are here in the Wilderneſs. below. And now, dear Children, what a <hi>Glorious</hi> Privilege is this? Don't you account it your Honour and Happineſs to be the <hi>Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings</hi> of your <hi>Earthly</hi> Parents? Is not a <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> Intereſt in their Love, and their <hi>conſtant</hi> Smiles upon you reckoned among the greateſt of your Earthly Comforts? They are certainly thus <hi>esteemed</hi> by every <hi>dutiful</hi> and <hi>obedient</hi> Child. But what is all this to an Intereſt in the more <hi>peculiar</hi> Love of God, and the more <hi>abundant</hi> Joys of the Holy Ghoſt? Is not one <hi>Smile</hi> from our Heavenly Father infinitely more to the <hi>pious</hi> Soul than all the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002256_0106_0FDADE038AD1E5C0"/>Happineſs this World can afford? How <hi>tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent</hi> then is the Dignity and Happineſs of being His <hi>Favourite</hi> Children? And thus upon the whole, you may plainly ſee, That a Life <hi>ſpent</hi> in the Service of God is the moſt <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>pleaſant</hi> Life in the whole World. And conſequently that thoſe who <hi>begin</hi> and <hi>end</hi> the Day of Life with God, make the <hi>best</hi> and <hi>wiſeſt</hi> Proviſion for themſelves in time, as well as to all Eternity.

We read in, Gen. 3.19. <hi>Duſt thou art and unto Duſt ſhalt thou return.</hi> And according to this Decree, the Apoſtle aſſerts (in Heb. 9.27.) <hi>It is appointed unto men once to dye —. What man therefore is he, that liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and ſhall not ſee Death?</hi> And ſince Death is thus <hi>unavoidable,</hi> and is attended, at the ſame time, with the utmoſt of natural Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors: (As every one knows that has had any <hi>realizing</hi> Apprehenſions concerning it.) I ſay ſince it is thus, it muſt needs be a point of the <hi>higheſt</hi> Wiſdom in us to think <hi>ſeriouſly</hi>
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:002256_0107_0FDADE05095E7FA0"/>of the <hi>Evil Day</hi> before it comes: And to make the <hi>ſpeedieſt</hi> and <hi>beſt</hi> Proviſion againſt it that we can: That ſo when we come to Encounter Death, The <hi>Proſpect</hi> of it may not <hi>Affright</hi> us into Everlaſting Horror and Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair. Now the moſt proper Courſe you can poſſibly take, not only to prevent this <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh</hi> and <hi>Diſtreſs</hi> in your Conflict with Death: But alſo to overcome the Fears of it, and ſo be able to <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>embrace</hi> it, as an abſent Child wou'd do, the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> that was ſent to Conduct him to his <hi>Fathers</hi> Houſe, is to begin a Life of Religion <hi>Now</hi> while you are in the <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Youth.</hi> For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides a <hi>conſtant habitual</hi> preparation for Death, which is an <hi>unſpeakable</hi> Privilege, you'l en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy all your Days, you will <hi>reap</hi> theſe <hi>ſpecial</hi> Benefits by it, when you come to meet <hi>the King of Terrors,</hi> and to look Death ſteadily in the Face.</p>
               <p n="1">1. YOU will be <hi>able</hi> to <hi>Reflect</hi> and <hi>Look back</hi> with greater Comfort upon your <hi>paſt</hi> Life and Converſation in the World than <hi>o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe</hi> you would do; or than <hi>many other</hi> dying Saints are <hi>enabled</hi> to do. You will not have <hi>the Sins of Youth:</hi> At moſt you will not have <hi>ſo many</hi> of them to come to your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and Diſtreſs you in a Dying Hour, as otherwiſe you will have. For do but conſider, How is it poſſible, that a poor <hi>Prodigal</hi> that returns to God after he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the <hi>biggeſt part</hi> of his <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Talents</hi> in the Service of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> ſhould find

Death (indeed) will <hi>eventually</hi> prove gain to every <hi>true</hi> Penitent. But then the <hi>Aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated</hi> Sins of Youth will afford a moſt <hi>melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly</hi> Proſpect unto him, that has <hi>wasted</hi> away the beſt of his Days in Sin and Vanity; and will in all probability <hi>extort</hi> ſuch a <hi>mournful</hi> Petition as that in a <hi>Dying</hi> hour, Pſal. 25.7. <hi>Remember not the Sins of my Youth, nor my Tranſgreſſions: according to thy mercy remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou me, for thy goodneſs ſake, O LORD.</hi> And this will very much <hi>damp</hi> the Joys and Comforts of his laſt Minutes. Whereas on the other hand, The <hi>Early</hi> Convert when he comes to lye upon a <hi>Death Bed,</hi> may firſt look <hi>back</hi> and take a Proſpect of his paſt Life, and then look <hi>upward,</hi> and <hi>Appeal</hi> to God in the Language of holy <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> Iſai. 38.3. — <hi>Remember now, O LORD, I beſeech thee, how I have walked before thee in Truth, and with a perfect heart, and have</hi> (by thy Grace) <hi>done that which is good in thy ſight.</hi> And who but they that have had the <hi>happy</hi> Experience of of it, can tell how great the Conſolation in it is?</p>

Or, Is it not much more reaſonable to ſuppoſe, That ſince he ſet out <hi>betimes</hi> in the Work of his Lord, and has <hi>patiently</hi> born the <hi>heat</hi> and the <hi>burden</hi> of the Day, and is now come <hi>weary</hi> to the End of his Labours, that therefore his moſt <hi>Compaſſionate</hi> Lord has a more <hi>refreſhing</hi> Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial to revive his ſpirits withal, now the <hi>ſhadows of the Evening</hi> are come upon him? See how <hi>David</hi> (one <hi>that feared the Lord from his Youth</hi>) comforted himſelf with the <hi>Hopes</hi> of this aforehand; (and doubtleſs he <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced</hi> much <hi>more</hi> when he came to the <hi>Tryal</hi> than he had hitherto conceived of) Pſal. 23.4. <hi>Yea tho' I walk thro' the valley of the ſhadow of Death I will fear no evil: for thou art with me, thy rod, and thy ſtaff they comfort me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. THE <hi>ſooner</hi> you begin to Live to God, the <hi>brighter</hi> are your <hi>Evidences</hi> for Heaven like to be in a Dying Hour.

SINCE the <hi>peculiar</hi> Advantages of <hi>Early</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion are ſuch as we have heard, Thoſe of you that are in your YOUTHFUL DAYS ſhould improve the Conſideration of them as a moſt powerful Argument, <hi>to Seek, and Serve God, the God of your Fathers,</hi> without any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Delay.

<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002256_0111_0FDADE0E142C7D60"/>of ſuch a Deſign, our young people have had in ſeveral Diſcourſes the <hi>Duties</hi> of early Piety explain'd, their <hi>Obligations</hi> to it laid down, and the <hi>Advantages</hi> of it ſet forth. The Part aſſign'd me towards this Work, is to conſider the <hi>Diſcouragements,</hi> reply to the <hi>Objections,</hi> which may ariſe in the Minds of any of them againſt being early Religious, and which Satan, (who to be ſure will do all he can to Counterwork us) will not fail to call before them.

               </gap>d) of a plentiful Eſtate, and in ſome public Poſt, who came to CHRIST and Addreſs'd Him upon a moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Important Caſe: <hi>Good Maſter, what good thing ſhall I do, that I may have eternal Life?</hi> This Young Man was Inſtructed in and did believe the Doctrine of eternal Life; and was concern'd how he might obtain it: He was ſenſible there was ſomething to be done in order to the obtaining of it; and was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to know what it was that he might do it.

            <p>IT was a <hi>lovely ſight this</hi> to behold.

To prove this Young Man therefore, and ſee whether he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo ſet for Heaven and Eternal Life as he ſeem'd to be, Chriſt gives him this <q>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Trial</q>, <hi>Go, ſell all thou haſt in this World, and give it to the poor, and follow me, and take up with a Treaſure in Heaven in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of all.</hi> At this it was that he <hi>went away ſorrowful.</hi> He could not comply with this Motion. Could not come up to theſe Terms. He <hi>Objected</hi> againſt this as an <hi>hard ſaying,</hi> and was <hi>diſcourag'd</hi> by it from following Chriſt, and any more ſeeking after Eternal Life. If Religion would coſt him ſo dear as this came to, he muſt even have done with the Tho'ts of it. This Saying of Chriſt was ſuch a <hi>Diſcouragement</hi> and <hi>Objection</hi> as he could not get over; it proved a fatal Hinderance and Impediment to him.</p>
            <p>BUT it is now time for me to diſmiſs the <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Context,</hi> and to apply my ſelf to that <hi>ſingle Part</hi> aſſign'd me in the preſent
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002256_0114_0FDAC97BDA8B0F28"/>Work, which as I told you before is to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and reply to ſome <hi>Diſcouragements</hi> and <hi>Objections</hi> which <hi>Young People</hi> may have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt being Religious in their <hi>Youthful Days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obj. I. IF I am Religious in my Youthful Days (may the Young Perſon think and ſay) <hi>I ſhall debar and deprive my ſelf of thoſe Pleaſures and Delights of Life, which Youth is the proper Seaſon for the Taſte and Injoyment of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO this I Anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. RELIGION does not <hi>wholly</hi> debar you of and reſtrain you from the Delights and Pleaſures of this Life. I deed you muſt not <hi>make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the fleſh, to fu fit the Luſts thereof.</hi> You muſt not give Appetite and Senſe its full Swinge. Nevertheleſs, there is not a total Reſtraint laid upon you. It is not criminal for you to be cheerful and merry in Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. Young people may uſe the Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Pleaſures of life, ſuch as are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to their Age, ſo as they do but keep within the Bounds of Innocence and Modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Religion is not ſuch a ſower ill<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aturd thing as you may imagine it to be. It does not give a <hi>total</hi> Prohibition of earthly Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, but allows of, yea directs to the ſober and moderate Uſe of them. Eccl. 9.7, 8, 9. <hi>Go thy Way, eat thy Bread with Joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry heart; for God now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepteth thy Works. Let thy Garments be always white; and let thy Head lack no Oinment. Live
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002256_0114_0FDAC97BDA8B0F28"/>joyfully with the Wiſe whom thou lovest, all the days of the life of thy Vanity, which he hath given thee under the Sun: for that is thy Portion in this Life, and in thy Labour which thou takeſt under the Sun. Uſe</hi> this World you may, ſo you do not <hi>abuſe</hi> it. Religion would only direct and lead you to ſuch a Uſe and Injoyment of earthly Pleaſures and Delights, as may be without Offence to God, and Hurt to your ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Pleaſures which Religion requires you to deny yourſelves in, and abandon; <hi>What are they?</hi> They are <hi>mean</hi> and <hi>baſe</hi> at beſt; ſuited only to the Inferior Part of Man. They have in them more of the Beaſt than the Man; and the Bruit Creatures may have a more exquiſite Senſe of them than we have. And what are theſe to a rational Soul? To us, whom God hath <hi>taught more than the Beaſts of the Earth; and made wiſer than the Fowls of Heaven?</hi> They are <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>deceitful;</hi> have in them the Shew of Pleaſure only, and not the Subſtance, the Appearance and Name rather than the Thing; The Fruition of them does not anſwer the Expectation. <hi>Solomon</hi> ran a prodigious length in Senſualities, in the Purſuit of forbidden Pleaſures. He <hi>prov'd his heart with Mirth,</hi> &amp; <hi>gave himſelf to know Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Folly; whatſoever his Eyes deſired he kept not from them, he withheld not his Heart from any Joy.</hi> Well, and what Satisfaction did all this afford him? Why truly none at all. <hi>He ſaid of Laughter it is mad: and of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002256_0115_0FDADE142F99FD48"/>Mirth, what doeth it?</hi> Eccl. 2.2. Again, they are <hi>vaniſhing</hi> and <hi>periſhing.</hi> The World paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away, and ſo do the Luſts thereof. The Pleaſures of Sin they are <hi>but for a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and a very ſhort Seaſon too. They will <hi>periſh in the uſing.</hi> They are eaſily diſturb'd and daſh'd, and quickly over and gone. Once more, They are <hi>deſtructive</hi> and <hi>deadly.</hi> Bitter Sweets! They pleaſe and gratify now, but they will fling and torment hereafter. The Fruit and End of them is <hi>Death.</hi> Prov. 9.17, 18. <hi>Stolen Waters are ſweet, and Bread eaten in ſecret is pleaſant. But he knoweth not that the Dead are there; and that her guests are in the Depths of Hell.</hi> So then the Pleaſures which Religion requires you to abandon, are ſuch as you have little Reaſon to be fond of: However the corrupt heart may find ſome Reluctancy in refuſing them, yet (as one apt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſes here the Words of <hi>Abigail</hi> to <hi>David</hi> about his denying himſelf the Satisfaction of being reveng'd on <hi>Nabal</hi>) <hi>afterwards it ſhall be no G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002256_0115_0FDADE142F99FD48"/>There is ſuch Pleaſantneſs no where elſe to be found as in theſe Ways. The Delights that are to be met with in the Way of Duty and Religion are ſuch as the greateſt Senſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt cannot boaſt of. The Pleaſures of Piety do exceed the Pleaſures of Sin and Senſe, in the <hi>Subject</hi> of them; the Soul the better and more noble part. In the <hi>Object</hi> of them; an Infinite God, a glorious Chriſt, all ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly Places. And in the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi> of them; they are true and ſolid, pure and ſubſtantial, rational and ſublime, durable and laſting, not ſo eaſily daſh'd and broken by the little Accidents and ſudden Changes of this life, and the <hi>longer</hi> the Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, the <hi>higher</hi> the Pleaſure riſes.</p>
            <p>WHAT are the poor &amp; <hi>beggarly</hi> Pleaſures of this life, to the Teſtimony of a good Conſcience, Joy in the Holy Ghoſt, Delight in God, and Communion with Him? Such as abandon ſenſual Pleaſures for ſpiritual Delights, and holy Joys, they only exchange Dirt and Traſh for Gold and Pearls, leave the <hi>Garlick</hi> and <hi>Onions</hi> of <hi>Egypt</hi> for the <hi>Milk</hi> and <hi>Honey</hi> of <hi>Canaan.</hi> O our <hi>Young People!</hi> If you did but once experience the Pleaſures of true Piety, they would put your Mouths out of taſte to the Pleaſures of Sin and Senſe; having taſted of this <hi>new</hi> Wine, you would not ask for the <hi>old,</hi> becauſe the <hi>new</hi> is better.

            <p>Obj. II. <hi>THE Work of Religion is very hard and difficult;</hi> and I fear that if I make a Trial I ſhall find it inſuperable, and not be able to go thro' with it.</p>
            <p>Anſw. WE would deal plainly and truly with you, and let you know the worſt before-hand, that ſo you may ſit down and <hi>count the Coſt</hi> before you begin to build, and may ſo ſet out as that you may not turn back diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rag'd by meeting with what you did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect: We do therefore acknowledge it to you, that <hi>it is no eaſy thing to be a true and thorough Chriſtian.</hi> Thoſe that are moſt acquainted with practical Religion, and the Power of Godlineſs, know this. The Chriſtan Life is compar'd in Scripture to <hi>running a Race,</hi> to <hi>wreſtling,</hi> to <hi>fighting,</hi> and the like; all which imply Difficulty, Oppoſition, Hardneſs, and the great Need there is of Skill, Activity, Strength, Reſolution and Patience. Religion does not conſult your carnal Eaſe, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. There are many laborious Duties for
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:002256_0116_0FDADE1585C3A5A0"/>you to perform, many <hi>Temptations</hi> to reſiſt, <hi>Corruptions</hi> to mortify, and <hi>Conflicts</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure. A few <hi>lazy</hi> Wiſhes and <hi>faint</hi> Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours will never carry you to Heaven. You muſt <hi>watch and be ſober, watch and pray, watch and work;</hi> you muſt <hi>gird up the Loins of your Minds, and put</hi> on and manage <hi>the whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of God,</hi> preſs on, and fight thro'. You muſt overcome the <hi>World,</hi> the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> and <hi>take the Kingdom of Heaven by</hi> an holy <hi>Violence.</hi> Nevertheleſs, tho' the Work of Religion be thus hard and difficult, you ſhould not <hi>object</hi> againſt it, you may not be <hi>diſcourag'd</hi> from it on the Account hereof.</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF there is any Truth in Religion, the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty that attends the Practice of it, cannot be allow'd to be a reaſonable or ſufficient Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt it. If there be a God that made you, that has a Right to rule you now and to judge you hereafter. If you have Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Souls within you, that muſt Live for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever either in a World of Happineſs or in a World of Miſery. If you are haſtning either to Heaven or Hell; and it is like to fare with you in the other World according as you have Liv'd in this: I ſay, if theſe things be true which Religion teaches, (as they cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are, and as you do believe that they are) why then ſurely <hi>no</hi> Pains can be judg'd too much to take, <hi>no</hi> Difficulties too great to be undergone, in an Affair of <hi>ſo</hi> high a Concern. Can you think any thing too much
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002256_0117_0FDADE1AE8D22648"/>for to ſave your Souls, to eſcape Hell and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Heaven? Oh what Pains will Men take, what Difficulties will they go through, what Hardſhips will they endure in proſecuting Matters of far leſs Concernment; in Affairs that relate only to the Body and the Life that now is? What Trouble will Men be at to get the Riches, or the Honours, or the Pleaſures of this World? <hi>Compaſſing both Sea and Land</hi> for them. What a Folly then, what a Shame is it for you to make ſuch an Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Caſe? Wherein, if in any thing at all, <hi>Neceſſity is laid upon you,</hi> and <hi>Woe to you</hi> if you do not comply? One would think there is nothing ſo difficult, but it ſhould be readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and willingly entred upon and engaged in, if the Salvation of the Soul, and the eternal Welfare of that, be at all concern'd in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Difficulty that attends the Practice of Religion and Godlineſs can be no ſufficient Objection againſt it, becauſe <hi>The Way of Sin and Wickedneſs is attended with as much or more.</hi> It is really ſo, that there is many times more Self-denial undergone, and Pains taken, in the Service of Sin and Luſt, than the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Religion calls for. Prov. 13.15. <hi>The way of Tranſgreſſors is hard,</hi> Jer. 9.5. <hi>They weary themſelves to commit Iniquity.</hi> There is no worſe Slavery than to Live in the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of baſe Luſts. How is the Sinner in the Gratification of them, carried by Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Headlong, contrary to the Dictates of his Reaſon, and the Checks of Conſcience?
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002256_0117_0FDADE1AE8D22648"/>How is his Time conſumed therein, his Eſtate often waſted, and his Body enfeebled? How <q>many Thouſands die Martyrs to their Luſts, and are burnt with as keen a Fire (tho' not ſo honourable) as that the <hi>Martyrs</hi> were fry'd in?</q> Sometimes the very <hi>Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance</hi> of Sin gives ſufficient Uneaſineſs and Trouble; but more eſpecially the <hi>Reflection</hi> on it. How does the Sinner ſtart and recoil at his own Actions when he thinks them over? One of the greateſt Troubles in this World is for a Sinner to look within himſelf, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what he has done. The Scripture ſpeaks of the Condition of Sinners in this World as full of Uneaſineſs and Diſquiet. Iſai. 57.20, 21. <hi>The wicked are like the troubled ſea when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt: There is no peace ſaith my God unto the wicked.</hi> Such often diſſemble their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, <q>and make an <hi>appearance</hi> of Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; but God who is acquainted with the ſecrets of all hearts, knows what horror rages in their Breaſts.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. WHATEVER Difficulty attends the Practice of Religion and Godlineſs, <hi>the Grace of God can enable you thereunto notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> You are not left to ſtruggle with the difficulties of Religion in your own ſingle Strength, but God is ready to afford you His Help and Aſſiſtance, <hi>thro' whom ſtrengthning of us we can do all things.</hi> You have not only the Outward Arguments of Religion to encourage you to encounter the difficulties of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:002256_0118_0FDADE1C448D4C68"/>it, but the Promiſe of His Holy Spirit to help and aſſiſt you. Ezek. 11.19. <hi>I will put my ſpirit within them, and they ſhall walk in my ſtatutes, and keep my commandments and do them.</hi> He is ready to do this for all that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely and in good earneſt apply themſelves to Him. Wherefore inſtead of objecting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, or being diſcouraged from Religion by reaſon of the difficulties that attend the practice of it, you ſhould only be quicken'd thereby, according to the advice of the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,</hi> Heb. 4.16. <hi>to come boldly to the throne of Grace, that you may find grace to help you in time of need.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. THE greateſt difficulty will be in your <hi>first ſetting out</hi> in the Ways of Religion. What in Religion may ſeem hard at firſt, thro' the Corruption of our Nature, and our former Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomedneſs to Sin, afterwards Uſe and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe and the Grace of God will make eaſy. When once you are well entred in the Service of God, you will find it perfect Freedom; and in a little time you will be able to atteſt to the truth of that, 1 Joh. 5.3. <hi>His Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments are not grievous.</hi> Chriſt's Yoke, (ſays One) grows eaſier and ſmoother, when we have born it upon us; tho' perhaps at the very firſt putting on, the fleſh will ſtrive hard to fling it off. I remember to have read in the Life of Mr. <hi>Philip Henry,</hi> that he once in Preaching from thoſe words, Mat. 11.30. <hi>My yoke is eaſy,</hi> after many things inſiſted on to prove the Yoke of Chriſt an eaſy Yoke,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002256_0118_0FDADE1C448D4C68"/>at laſt appeal'd to the <hi>Experiences</hi> of all that had any time drawn in that Yoke, and then gave in his own Teſtimony after this affecting manner. <hi>I,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>will here witneſs for one, who through Grace have in ſome poor Meaſure been drawing in this Yoke, now above Thirty Years, and I have found it an eaſy Yoke, and like my Choice too well to change.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more here,</p>
            <p n="5">5. THERE is that Sweetneſs and Pleaſure <hi>accompanying</hi> the Practice of Religion and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and that glorious Reward <hi>following</hi> it, that far out-weigh all its Troubles and Difficulties. I might here ſhow, if my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Limits would allow, how that in <hi>all</hi> the ſeveral <hi>Acts, Inſtances,</hi> and <hi>Duties</hi> of Religion, even thoſe that ſeem the <hi>hard Leſſons of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> there is a Sweetneſs and Pleaſure to be found, not only to ſupport but delight the Soul. Her Ways are Ways of Pleaſantneſs, and <hi>all</hi> her Paths are Peace.</p>
            <p>AND then, what a <hi>bleſſed Hope</hi> is ſet before you in the end to invite &amp; animate you? All the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of Religion will be abundantly compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated by a glorious Recompence of Reward in the next World. Religion propoſes ſo great a Reward to you, as that if you ſhould ſpend your whole Life in Labour and Toil for it, it would be worth the while. It is the moſt noble that Mans Nature is capable of; ſet forth to us in Scripture by many choſen Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons, as particularly by a royal <hi>Throne,</hi> a glorious <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and a glittering <hi>Crown.</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:002256_0119_0FDADE1DC3FC8200"/>Rev. 3.21. <hi>Him that overcometh will I gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And now, O <hi>Young Man,</hi> ſhall not this ſo tempt and fire your Ambition as to make you think all Difficulty light and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable that may lie in your way. Will not this, think you, countervail for a few days labour and difficulty?</p>
            <p>Obj. III. BUT <hi>Religion will expoſe me to many Troubles and Sufferings:</hi> It is <hi>thro' much Tribulation that we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God:</hi> And <hi>all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, muſt ſuffer Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO this it may be anſwered, that</p>
            <p>TROUBLES and Sufferings are to be met with <hi>out</hi> of the way of Religion. The Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly (beſides <hi>Inward</hi> Troubles which are the

With reſpect to ſuch things as theſe, we are told, <hi>All things come alike to all, there is one Event to the Righteous and to the wicked,</hi> Eccl. 9.2. So that as to the <hi>common</hi> &amp; <hi>ordinary</hi> Afflictions of this Life, you'l be expos'd to them <hi>out</hi> of the way of Religion as well as <hi>in</hi> it.</p>
            <p>AS to any <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Sufferings purely on the Account of Religion, ſuch as the loſs of Liberty, Eſtate or Life, (tho' indeed we ſhould be ready to part with <hi>theſe</hi> in the Cauſe and for the Sake of Religion, ſhould we be called to it, yet) you are not ſure you ſhall meet with any of theſe. <hi>Bonds and Afflictions</hi> don't always <hi>abide</hi> the Saints.

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:002256_0120_0FDADE1F88A1F9E8"/>CHRIST, a great part of whoſe Sufferings were the Deriſions and Mockings that He met with.</p>
            <p>THE Jeſts and Scoffs you may meet with, will be ſo far from a Diſparagement to you, that they will be your Honour; and while they deride and mock you, others, the <hi>wiſer</hi> and <hi>better</hi> Sort, will eſteem and reverence you, and give you their beſt Regards.</p>
            <p>YOU had better be derided by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, than have your own Conſcience re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching of you; and it is no Matter in whoſe Eyes you are contemned, ſo as you are but <hi>great in the Sight of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Reproaches wherewith ſome, that <hi>ſit in the Seat of the Scornful</hi> may reproach you, for your turning into the Way of Godlineſs, will <hi>fall upon themſelves,</hi> will turn to their Condemnation and ſorer Puniſhment, in that Day when Sinners muſt account for <hi>all their hard Speeches;</hi> but they will turn to your Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage and Bleſſedneſs. For our Saviour has ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed are ye when Men ſhall revile you, and perſecute you, and ſay all manner of evil a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you falſly for my ſake. Rejoyce and be exceeding glad; for great is your Reward in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND it will not be long before thoſe who now deride and cenſure you, will openly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud and commend you, as the only wiſe and happy. <q>
                  <hi>We fools counted their Life Madneſs, and their End to be without Honour, how are they numbred with the Children of

            <p>HOWEVER the <hi>Objection</hi> is <hi>not true</hi> nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: For Religion <hi>is</hi> a Friend to outward Proſperity. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable to all things.</hi> The Bleſſing of Temporals is in the Covenant; (as was ſhow'd you under the Head of <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages,</hi> and therefore I will paſs it here.)</p>
            <p>BUT at laſt, Piety is the <hi>beſt</hi> Proſperity. <hi>The Merchandize whereof is better than the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold. Her Fruit is better than Gold, and her Revenue than choice Silver.</hi>

            <p>Obj. VI. RELIGION is <hi>no faſhionable thing;</hi> there are but few that really mind it, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Age or Quality; why ſhould I be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſingular?</p>
            <p>I Anſwer,</p>
            <p>SERIOUS Religion, and ſtrict Godlineſs, is but an Unfaſhionable thing in the World. The more's the Pity! But <hi>yet</hi> it is of <hi>Infinite Concernment</hi> to <hi>us</hi> that <hi>we</hi> heartily embrace it.</p>
            <p>LET none urge <hi>this</hi> Objection, unleſs they are willing to looſe the Favour of God, the Happineſs of Heaven, and their own precious and immortal Souls out of Genteelity, unleſs they are willing to be damn'd and go to Hell for Faſhion's ſake; This I hope you'l account too great a Complement.</p>
            <p>WE ſhould let no Example influence us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to what is our Duty and Intereſt. We ſhou'd not <hi>follow a Multitude to do evil;</hi> nor be <hi>conform'd to this World.</hi> The <hi>broad Way</hi> is

Think particularly on the Agonies of His Soul, which was exceeding ſorrowful even unto Death; under a Senſe of Sin and Apprehenſion of the Wrath of GOD; and endeavour after ſome I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation hereof. — Meditate on the Vanity and Meanneſs of all Earthly Things. Think on the Certainty and Awfulneſs of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Death, Judgment and Eternity. Think on the Glories and Joys of Heaven; the Miſeries and Pains of Hell: And the infinite Folly you are guilty of in not taking a timely Care to ſecure the Former, and avoid the Latter.</p>
            <p>THESE are ſome of the Things, which you ſhould meditate upon, and a due Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whereof wou'd have a rational Tendency to impreſs your hard Heart and awaken you out of your ſleepy Inſenſibility.</p>
            <p>O Sinner, I beſeech you then, Think on theſe Things ſadly in the fear of GOD. <hi>Set your Heart unto all theſe Things, give thy ſelf wholly to them.</hi> Let your Meditations be vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary and choſen, free and unconſtrain'd. Let them alſo be leaſurely, frequent, &amp; ſolemn. <hi>Take Time and take Pains,</hi> and be diligent in the Work.</p>
            <p>THIS is a Duty of <hi>vaſt Importance;</hi> and therefore muſt not be trifled in, much leſs neglected. This alſo is what you have a <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Capacity</hi> for. You <hi>can</hi> thus meditate if
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:002256_0139_0FDADE47C7F18608"/>you will. You don't want Ability; nor do you want Opportunity. And this is the <hi>beſt Uſe</hi> of your thinking Powers. Your Thoughts are generally buiſy: And what can you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them about, that is of greater Weight or Value than the Subjects before mention'd? Your Minds are very apt indeed to run upon your worldly Affairs, Pleaſures, Profits, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, Friends, &amp;c. But alas! how fooliſh are you in this? Since thoſe <hi>other</hi> Meditations, recommended above, are incomparably <hi>more neceſſary, excellent, delightful,</hi> and <hi>beneficial:</hi> And in themſelves are no greater Toil and Labour.</p>
            <p>WHAT <hi>Excuſe</hi> then can you frame? What Pretence to palliate your Neglect of holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Meditation? Verily thou art <hi>inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> O Man, whoever thou art, that liveſt in the omiſſion hereof. Be exhorted then, to diſmiſs your vain Thoughts with ſhame and Regret for them; and to overcome your natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Averſion to ſpiritual Meditation, and ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſet about this great Work. <hi>O that I cou'd perſwade you THIS NIGHT to retire and ſpend a little Moment in ſerious. Debates with your own Heart on the Sin and Folly of preſent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays in the Affairs of your Soul!</hi> And hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward to accuſtom your ſelf, now and then to ſeparate ſome ſmall Portion of your Time [tho' 'twere but a few Minutes in a Day] in ſolemn Conſideration of ſome awakening Truths; poſſibly this might be bleſſed to your ſaving Conviction: And methinks, <hi>This</hi> were
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002256_0139_0FDADE47C7F18608"/>but an <hi>inconſiderable</hi> Thing to do for your <hi>Soul.</hi> —There can be no rational Expectation of your thorough Awakening, 'till you can be brought to ſober Thinking. But if I cou'd perſuade you to this, (ſo neceſſary, ſo cheap, ſo reaſonable a Duty,) and you wou'd engage in it in Earneſt, it wou'd be a hopeful Omen of your Converſion. <q>O therefore deny not this much to <hi>you ſelf,</hi> deny it not to <hi>GOD,</hi> if you will deny it me. I have told the Truth: <hi>Conſider what I ſay, and the Lord give you underſtanding!</hi> 2 Tim. 2.7. or if you put me to conclude in harſher Terms, they ſhall be ſtill the <hi>Oracles of GOD.</hi> Pſal. 50.22. <hi>Now conſider this ye that forget GOD, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>AND ſo much for the <hi>Second</hi> Direction; which I have been the longer upon, becauſe of it's ſingular Importance in the preſent Caſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. YOU muſt with great Induſtry &amp; Care <hi>improve all proper</hi> OUTWARD HEL<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s and MEANS, <hi>conducible to Spiritual Conviction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">(1.) WITH a view to this End, Diligently <hi>read the Holy Scriptures, and other pious Books.</hi> Don't miſpend your Time and endanger your Soul by converſing with idle, leud, prophane Authors; which tends only to exalt Folly and alienate you more from the Life of God. But read Religious Compoſures; Books of Devotion, practical Sermons, pious Lives, &amp;c. particularly <hi>ſuch as are moſt ſuited to the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002256_0140_0FDADE504833E250"/>Caſe of the Secure.</hi> Chuſe with Caution: Peruſe with Deliberation &amp; Diligence.</p>
            <p>MORE eſpecially be converſant with the bleſſed BIBLE. Give your ſelf to reading in the Law of the Lord, which is perfect, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting the Soul, making wiſe the ſimple. Read your Bible frequently; Look into it Day &amp; Night; and that with a reachable and obedient Spirit: with attentive Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: with firm Belief: and a wiſe Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of what you read, to your own Soul, by way of Trial &amp; of Charge.— Obſerve theſe Directions in Reading your Bible; and this will probably be a ſucceſsful Means of your Awakening. The Apoſtle tells <hi>Timothy,</hi> who from a <hi>Child had known the Holy Scriptures,</hi> that they are <hi>profitable for Doctrine, for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, for Correction; and able to make men wiſe to Salvation,</hi> (2 Tim. 3.15, 16.)</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) ATTEND on the <hi>Publick Miniſtry of the Word.</hi> The common <hi>Catechiſm</hi> (that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Form of ſound Words which you will do well to ſtudy much, and ought to hold faſt in Faith and Love; This, I ſay,) teaches you, <q>that the SPIRIT of GOD maketh the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but <hi>eſpecially the Preaching,</hi> of the Word an effectual means of Convincing and Converting Sinners.</q>—The Truth of which Doctrine has been (thro' the Riches of Divine Grace) confirmed in innumerable Inſtances.— <hi>Attend then on the Word Preached.</hi> Look on the Publick Miniſtry, as a Divine Inſtitution.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002256_0140_0FDADE504833E250"/>Realize the ſpecial Preſence of GOD with His faithful Miniſters. Let every one ſo account of them as of the <hi>Embaſſadors of Christ,</hi> and <hi>Stewards of the Myſteries of God:</hi> and when they ſpeak according to the Law and to the Teſtimony, receive their Meſſage not as the Word of Man, but as (what it is indeed) the Word of GOD.—Let me here adviſe you, to be <hi>careful</hi> (tho' not too <hi>curious</hi>) in the Choice of the Miniſtry, you commit your Self to the Conduct of. Beware of an <hi>Ignorant</hi> Miniſtry; or a Miniſtry that is merely <hi>Speculative;</hi> or that is <hi>Superficial,</hi> and at beſt only throws a few Squibbs at groſſer Sins, but ſeldom (if ever) touches on more hidden ſpiritual Sins; nor attempts to lay open the Miſery, Guilt and Danger of a Natural ſtate, and ſhow Sinners their need of CHRIST for Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs &amp; Strength, &amp;c. Chuſe not a Miniſtry of either of theſe dangerous Characters. But fix your ſelf under a Skilful and Orthodox, a Godly and Experienc'd, a Practical Scriptural and Searching Miniſtry; which preaches JESUS CHRIST, and ſhuns not to declare the whole Counſel of GOD, and ſtudies to commend itſelf to every Man's Conſcience in the ſight of GOD.</p>
            <p>AND having <hi>choſen</hi> well, alſo <hi>improve</hi> well. Be ſwift to hear; and take heed <hi>how</hi> (as well as <hi>whom</hi>) you hear. Attend with Conſtancy, Reverence and Diligence, as an humble Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Lay aſide all ſuperfluity of naughtireſs: and receive with meekneſs the ingraffed Word, which is able to ſave your Soul. Receive
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002256_0141_0FDADE531D5B7508"/>the Truth in the Love of it; Mix the Word with Faith; Hide it in your Heart, and labour to preſs it on Conſcience, both in the hearing, and afterwards.</p>
            <p>UNDER the Conduct of theſe Rules make Uſe of the Word preach'd, as inſtrumental of Conviction &amp; Repentance; and it may be 'twill <hi>work effectually</hi> in you; as it did in them, of whom we read, in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) ENDEAVOUR to improve <hi>Awakening Providences</hi> for this End. Thus, Are you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Afflictions <hi>your ſelf?</hi> Labour to get your Heart ſuitably affected. Don't ſet God's Judgments at defiance, nor harden your ſelf againſt Diſcipline. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſometimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that <hi>the Rod gives Wiſdom.</hi> And <hi>Elihu</hi> before him; <hi>If they be bound in Fetters, and be holden in cords of Affliction: then he ſheweth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>hem their Work and their Tranſgreſſions, that they have exceeded. He openeth alſo their Ear unto Diſcipline, and commandeth that they return from Iniquity.</hi>— Afflictions by a natural Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy tend to ſoften &amp; humble. When GOD's Hand is upon you then, take this Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to preſs after Convictions. In the Day of Adverſity conſider. Hear the Rod, and who hath appointed it. Receive Correction; ſet in with Providence, and work together with GOD. Thus <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> &amp; thus the <hi>Prodigal Son</hi> improved their outward Afflictions to their inward Humiliation &amp; Repentance.</p>
            <p>LET me add here; Obſerve, &amp; Study to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002256_0141_0FDADE531D5B7508"/>affect your ſelf with the <hi>Death</hi> of other Young People; and the ſad Outcries of the Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent in their laſt Moments. Look on what befalls others, as a Warning &amp; Call from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to you, &amp; let it ſtrike an Awe upon you.— Let the <hi>Sudden</hi> Deaths which you have ſeen or heard of at any Time alarm your Fears and rouze you out of your Security.— And when it is a Time of <hi>Spreading Mortality,</hi> when Death rides in Triumph in our Streets, <hi>(and GOD only knows how near ſuch an awful Seaſon may be!)</hi> This is a loud Summons to every One; eſpecially to <hi>Young People</hi> who are moſt expoſed to Infectious Diſeaſes; a loud Call (I ſay) This is to Us to turn unto Him that ſmiteth. We ſhould wiſely obſerve, reſent, &amp; improve ſuch Diſpenſations; and ſtudy to affect our Hearts, that we may trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at the Arm of the LORD ſtretched out and humble our ſelves under His mighty Hand. This GOD expects. See <hi>Joel</hi> 2.1, &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">(4.) ANOTHER good Help to be made Uſe of, is <hi>religious Company and Conference.</hi> He that walketh with the Wiſe ſhall be wiſe: But a Companion of Fools ſhall be deſtroy'd. (<hi>Prov.</hi> 13.20.) The Fruit of the Righteous is a Tree of Life; and He that winneth Souls is wiſe (<hi>Prov.</hi> 11.30) I have before directed you to deſert (as ruinous) the unneceſſary Company of <hi>Vain</hi> Perſons. I now farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe you to betake your ſelf to the Society of the <hi>Awaken'd</hi> and <hi>Converted;</hi> whoſe pious
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:002256_0142_0FDADE548B83E040"/>Example and Diſcourſe, ſerious Counſels and Reproofs, may be bleſſed of GOD for your Conviction. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of Some, <hi>who do not obey the Word,</hi> as if they might be <hi>won by the good Converſation</hi> of their Aſſociates. Some have been wrought upon, <hi>this way,</hi> whom the Word did never reach. Reſolve then to be a <hi>Companion of them that fear the LORD.</hi> Acquaint your Self betimes with the Godly; and perhaps their holy Communion may be a Savour of Life unto you. As live-Coals kindle thoſe that are dead: So to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with lively Saints may have a warm and enlivening Influence upon you. <q>Light may break in upon you, as a Flame from a ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Fire!</q>
            </p>
            <p>THESE are the external Helps, which you are adviſed to uſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>HEARKEN to the loweſt</hi> WHISPERS <hi>of</hi> CONSCIENCE; <hi>obſerve and cultivate the leaſt Beginnings of Conviction.</hi> Hoiſt and ſpread the Sails when the Wind <hi>begins</hi> to blow. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen all the Powers of your Soul, to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Breathings; and cheriſh the fainteſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes of the HOLY SPIRIT. In the uſe of Means, wait and watch for Convictions; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace 'em at their <hi>firſt</hi> Offer or Approach. When Light flaſhes in upon you, don't let your Heart riſe in Oppoſition, or your Mind divert and ſtart away. But whatſoever good Thought is at any Time darted into you, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately cloſe with it and faſten it, as a Nail in a ſure Place. Whatſoever devout
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:002256_0142_0FDADE548B83E040"/>Affection begins to ſtir in you, don't go to ſtifle and ſmother it, but carefully nouriſh it. Back the firſt Motions of the SPIRIT with loſe Conſideration and agreeable Ejaculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: By which Method a little Spark may happily kindle into a living Flame, and a ſmall Ray of Light prove the Dawning of the perfect Day.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>SEEK to GOD by</hi> PRAYER, <hi>for Convictions.</hi> Prayer indeed ſhou'd precede, accompany and follow the Uſe of Means, and Endeavours: And it is an excellent Means it ſelf. Pray to GOD then as for Pardon and other Mercies, ſo for Conviction and Repentance which is the Gift of GOD. Beg of GOD that He wou'd ſend His HOLY SPIRIT to convince you of <hi>Sin,</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> and of <hi>Judgment.</hi> Realize it that GOD only is able (and that He is graciouſly willing) effectually to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten and awaken you; and in the belief of this, ceaſe not day and night Crying to GOD, that He would open your Eyes and turn you from Darkneſs to Light. Beg that He wou'd not ſuffer you any longer to trample on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, to reſiſt the SPIRIT and be eaſy in your Bondage. Beg that He wou'd not leave you to your own fooliſh Heart and trifling Endeavours in ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ake you out of your falſe Peace and Security, and inſpire you with a juſt concern for your periſhing Soul; that He would give you ſeeing Eyes, hearing Ears, and a contrite Heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:002256_0143_0FDADE5616652F50"/>
BUT if you expect to obtain the deſir'd Bleſſing, you muſt be <hi>diligent,</hi> and <hi>conſtant,</hi> in ſeeking it.— Uſe your ſelf to tranſient, ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Prayer on all proper Occaſions, which will wonderfully tend to fix your Thoughts and warm your Heart, and perhaps may be the means of laſting Impreſſions.— Keep up a <hi>ſtated</hi> courſe of more ſolemn Prayer: &amp; in the Name of CHRIST importunately beg for the teaching &amp; convincing Influences of the Divine SPIRIT. Look to your own Spirit, and watch over your Senſes, when calling upon the LORD. Don't hurry over your Prayers, and haſten to riſe from your Knees. Make a ſolemn Buſineſs of this Duty. Retire into ſome ſecret Place, &amp; devote ſome <hi>Time</hi> to the performance of it. Content not your ſelf with a few bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Petitions, put up when in Company with others, or in your Bed: Nay, but thou, <hi>when thou prayeſt, enter into thy Cloſet, and ſhut the Door, and pray to thy Father who ſeeth in ſecret.</hi> Make Conſcience of doing this, <hi>Morning</hi> and <hi>Evening</hi> at leaſt: And endeavour to be fervent in Spirit, &amp; continue inſtant in Prayer without ceaſing. Cold Formality, &amp; Remiſsneſs in Prayer drive away the Holy SPIRIT. And I believe there is not a more common &amp; fatal Impediment to Converſion, than the Neglect of, or Negligence in Cloſet-Duties. Beware then hereof.</p>
            <p>THUS I have given you ſome imperfect Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, <hi>What Methods to take in Order to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>IT is Time now to haſten to the <hi>SECOND Branch</hi> of the Exhortation.</p>
            <p>HAVING ſpoken to the <hi>Secure:</hi> I am now to Addreſs thoſe among our Young People who are under ſome CONVICTIONS and AWAKENINGS.</p>
            <p>SOME of this Sort, I perſuade my ſelf there are here preſent before the LORD.

            <p>UNTO ſuch I ſhall therefore now offer Something by way of Counſel and Direction. The LORD, who knows who they are, make it a word in Seaſon to them that are weary!</p>
            <p>NOW in the Firſt place, Let me exhort you to be THANKFUL <hi>to GOD for your preſent Troubles and Convictions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SEE the <hi>Hand of GOD</hi> in Them. Look on your preſent Trouble of Conſcience as the Work of the SPIRIT, whether common or ſpecial. They are GOD's Terrors, His Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows. They muſt not be imputed to Satan, to your Selves, or to Diſtemper of Body, as
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002256_0144_0FDADE578E10AD70"/>the original Cauſe. No; For it is the Hand of GOD, which thus writes bitter Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, and makes you to poſſeſs the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities of your Youth. Own and Adore GOD herein. Alſo ſee the <hi>Mercy</hi> of GOD unto you, Prize your Convictions, and be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Don't reſent your Trouble as a Miſery and Unhappineſs; It is ten thouſand Times more eligible than carnal Security, which is the broad Road to Hell.</p>
            <p>CONSIDER; This Trouble of Conſcience, is the <hi>Method of the Divine</hi> SPIRIT with all that are brought home to GOD; tho' there are very different Degrees of it. He humbles before He exalts. Moreover, This ſeems re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in the Reaſon of Things, as a <hi>neceſſary Preparatory</hi> to ſaving <hi>Faith.</hi> For CHRIST will not be precious to any, till Sin &amp; Wrath become bitter and burdenſome to Conſcience. —And then hereby you are brought <hi>nigh the Kingdom of God,</hi> and may take encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the Invitations of the Goſpel; which are peculiarly directed to ſuch as la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour &amp; are heavy laden. — Your preſent Trouble is a <hi>Symptom of intended Mercy.</hi> It is wholeſome Diſcipline you are under. <q>It is the SPIRIT of GOD that is wounding of you, &amp; you need not fear a Lance in the Hand of Love &amp; Tenderneſs.</q> O don't re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret your Caſe then; but be thankful to GOD, that you are not left to ſuch a Spirit of Slumber, as many others about you are, and as you alſo deſervedly might have been.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>BE careful to</hi> PRESERVE <hi>your preſent Convictions; and watch againſt all that threatens you with the loſs of them, or miſcarriage under them.</hi> You are in great Danger: For the <hi>Devil</hi> hates to ſee you under this Trouble; He is afraid of loſing a Subject, &amp; gnaſheth his Teeth for Vexation.

Again, Take heed of <hi>indulging any ſecret Luſt,</hi> or <hi>perſiſting in any known Way of Wickedneſs;</hi> which will offend the HOLY SPIRIT, and muſt needs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file and cloud and harden Conſcience.

If you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge ſuch a legal Phariſaical Spirit, you may perhaps pacify Conſcience hereby, but you will only inflame the Wrath of GOD yet more againſt you, and provoke the Spirit to leave you. Again, Beware of <hi>Diſcouragement.</hi> As you muſt not give Way to falſe Hopes, ſo neither to Deſpondencies. Don't take up any deſperate Concluſions, as if there was no Hope nor Help for you; this will check &amp; chill Convictions, weaken and obſtruct the Motions of the Spirit; and tempt you to abandon your ſelf to ſullen Melancholy or ſottiſh Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Finally, Beware of <hi>all worldly Entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Entanglements.</hi> Endeavour to get above the Frowns &amp; Flatteries of the World. Take heed leſt you fall aſleep on the ſoft Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of external Eaſe, Pomp &amp; Pleaſure. Be blind to the deceitful Smiles, and deaf to the tempting Charms of a vain World. And take

Multitudes do drown in the Sea, or bury in the Earth, or barter away in the Shop, or let one care or other ſuppreſs &amp; ſhift off the Convictions they receive in the Houſe of GOD. Unhappy Buſineſs has ſlain its Ten Thouſands. Take heed leſt being careful &amp; cumber'd about many Things, you forget and forfeit the one Thing needful.</p>
            <p>FURTHER Beware of <hi>Evil Company.</hi> This was caution'd againſt before as tending to <hi>keep</hi> Sinners ſecure; and now as tending to <hi>make</hi> Sinners ſecure. And indeed thoſe under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions have as much need of being warned againſt this Temptation, as thoſe in Security. For how often do vain Companions perſwade the convinced Sinner off of ſerious Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; laugh him out of a penſive Frame, or hector away his Troubles? O ſave your ſelf therefore from this untoward Generation. Have no Fellowſhip with the unfruitful Works of Darkneſs. Reſolve with the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,</hi> &amp; ſay; Depart from me, all ye Workers of Iniquity, for I will keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of my GOD.—And alſo Beware of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing infected by <hi>Evil Examples.</hi> Others Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is, no Doubt, a common Temptation to Young People. They ſee their Companions, and alas! too often their <hi>Elders,</hi> Their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents (it may be) or Maſters and Miſtreſſes, Theſe they obſerve are light and vain; and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002256_0146_0FDADE61752A2350"/>this prompts them to ſhake off awakening Thoughts &amp; Fears. Beware O YOUNG MAN, of this too common Snare. Let neither <hi>Fear</hi> nor <hi>Love</hi> of any betray you into an <hi>Imitation</hi> of their Security. Dare to be ſingular in that which is good. Don't give Way to a vicious Shame or falſe Modeſty, which may tempt you to ſinful Compliances with others.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, Beware of <hi>carnal Counſels</hi> in the day of your Diſtreſs. Unbelieving Friends are ſome of the <hi>worſt</hi> Counſellours in this caſe. The beſt Advice that ſuch miſerable Comforters or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily give is to <hi>heave off</hi> trouble ſome Impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to enjoy ones ſelf, &amp; Friends, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Life, &amp;c. And what Numbers of Young People have fatally miſcarry'd under hopeful Convictions by hearkening to ſuch unhappy Advice? O ſtop your Ears againſt the baneful Counſels of carnal Acquaintants. <hi>Conſult not with Fleſh and Blood, My Son, if Sinners entice thee, conſent thou not. Let the Counſel of the Wicked be far from you.</hi> Liſten not to the ungodly Whiſpers or Clamours of Men of corrupt Minds, however you may be related to or dependent on them.

Put on Courage and Reſolution; for want where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of Conſcience is not ſeldom over-awed &amp; born down againſt it's own Light and Bent.</p>
            <p>THUS I have caution'd you againſt ſome of the many Wiles whereby Satan uſes to <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert</hi> or <hi>pervert</hi> Convictions begun in Young

Conſider; your Great Judge keeps an exact Memorandum of all the Motions of His SPIRIT, &amp; your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment of them; &amp; will one day call you to an Account for them; &amp; how will you anſwer it, if you quench your Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? If you do thus, verily your Guilt &amp; your Folly will be great. This will be to add Rebellion to Sin. Hereby you will fight againſt GOD, diſobey His Voice, abuſe His Patience &amp; affront His HOLY SPIRIT. You will impiouſly &amp; baſely fly in the Face of your Great Phyſician and deſpiſe the only Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. You will hereby provoke the grieved Spirit to forſake you; which is a Judgment (I fear) not a few of the riſen Youth of this dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate Day are under: And you will highly gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the unclean Spirit, &amp; invite his Return into his old Dwelling with more ſtrength and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany than Ever; and ſo your laſt State will be worſe than the firſt, more miſerable and more dangerous.

Thou are not far from the Kingdom of GOD: and will you ſuffer your ſelf to periſh on the very Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Canaan?

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:002256_0148_0FDADE6466CC9E00"/>dreadful indeed, &amp; how bitter will be the Reflection? — Now this you are in danger of thro' the Temptations of <hi>Satan,</hi> and the Treachery of an evil <hi>Heart</hi> that is ready to ſide with him.</p>

            <p>SOME ſuch (We truſt) there be among our Young People, as bad as the Times are: Yea <hi>Many</hi> (through the Grace of GOD) do we behold walking in the Truth. I hope I ſpeak to not a Few Such at this Time. Now, Ye that fear GOD, give Audience. Hear the the Exhortation, which ſpeaketh to <hi>You</hi> as unto <hi>Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. BE counſel'd to <hi>endeavour after a well-grounded</hi> HOPE <hi>and</hi> ASSURANCE <hi>of your good Eſtate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with this Advice, becauſe to Me it ſeems to lie in the Foundation of ſuch other Counſels, as are to be given the Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. <hi>Wherefore Brethren, the rather give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make your Calling and Election ſure,</hi> 2 Per. 1.10. Reſt not in Uncertainties: But
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:002256_0151_0FDAC980571E7500"/>labor after <hi>the Aſſurance of Faith.</hi> To this End; Study your own Hearts, and be much in Self-examination. Try your Selves by juſt Rules; and be deliberate, prudent, impartial, prayerful, and frequent in this Work. And ceaſe not till you come to a rational Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about your Regeneracy: Which will be a mighty incentive to Duty; will enable you to take the Comfort that belongs to you; and will be a great Support and Defenſe in Hours of Temptation. For want of that, Many loſe the Comfort, and neglect ſome of the Duties of Early Piety; which is ſad.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>STUDY</hi> THANKFULNESS <hi>to GOD, the</hi> GREATEST <hi>Thankfulneſs.</hi> Give GOD the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of your Converſion. Beware of aſcribing too Much to Means, Inſtruments, and Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors. Let him that Glorieth, glory in the LORD. See His Efficiency; and Adore His Wiſdom, Power, and Grace, which have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded toward You. And let your Heart and Mouth be filled with admiring Praiſes.</p>
            <p>TO excite your Gratitude and Wonder, Often look back on your <hi>natural</hi> Condition, and take a View of the Guilts, Miſeries, and Dangers of it. Conſider alſo the ſuperlative Excellency of the <hi>Work</hi> wrought upon You; and the Bleſſedneſs of the <hi>State</hi> you are brought into; a State of Juſtification, Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Sanctification, and of habitual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paredneſs for a glorious Eternity. Conſider the ſpecial and unnumber'd <hi>Advantages</hi> of an Early Converſion; and what a far more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:002256_0151_0FDAC980571E7500"/>glorious Proſpect it affords you. And conſider, How God hath made you to <hi>differ</hi> from innumerable Others. Remember alſo what <hi>Provocations</hi> you gave the HOLY SPIRIT (while under His Hand) to forſake you. Theſe Reflections beſpeak your thankful Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirations. Wherefore take with you Words, and ſay as in <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 6. <hi>I thank Thee,</hi> O Father, becauſe Thou haſt hid theſe Things from the Wiſe and Prudent, and haſt reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them unto Babes: Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy Sight.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>KEEP up a very</hi> HUMBLE <hi>Frame of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Remembring what you were <hi>before</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion: Remembring what <hi>Humiliations</hi> you paſſed through <hi>in</hi> Converſion: And Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what you are at <hi>preſent;</hi> ſtill at a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from GOD; ſtill a Dependent on free Mercy for all you need; ſtill a ſinful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, doing little for GOD, often rebelling againſt Him, and in all Things coming ſhort of His Glory; ſtill feeble and impotent and without His ſpecial Help will become an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy Prey to every Temptation; ſtill in danger of ſuch Apoſtaſies, as may blemiſh your Name, gall your Conſcience, and procure the Hidings of GOD's Face. — O remember theſe Things, and let them check all the Tendencies of a corrupt Heart to ſpiritual Pride. Be not high-minded; but Fear. — I think fit to add here; <hi>don't proudly murmur if you do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently obtain thoſe Joys, you looked for,</hi> If you meet with Temptations, and Troubles within
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:002256_0152_0FDADE65C3A5C2F8"/>and without, yet don't <hi>repine.</hi> You are not now dealt with unjuſtly: Nay all is in Love to you. GOD is now training you up to live a Life of Faith. Perhaps He is (by His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Methods) ripening you for great Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; or preparing you for great Uſefulneſs hereafter. Beware then of every murmuring, and of every Self-exalting Thought.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>BRING forth Fruits</hi> MEET <hi>for</hi> REPEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TANCE, and walk in Newneſs of Life. As ye have received CHRIST JESUS the LORD: So Walk ye in Him. Put on the Livery of CHRIST; take upon you the Badges of Chriſtianity; make an open Profeſſion; or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your Converſation aright, and ſhew forth the Praiſes of Him who hath called you out of Darkneſs. For ye were ſometimes Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but now are ye Light in the LORD: Walk as the Children of Light. Flee Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Luſts: And live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godlily.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>SEE that ye walk</hi> CIRCUMSPECTLY. Walk by Rule, the Goſpel-Rule. Study it; govern your ſelves according to it in the whole Work of Obedience, as to Matter and Manner, Principles, Motives, and Seaſons. The Scriptures were written to <hi>give the Young Man. Knowlege and Diſcretion.</hi> And <hi>Young Men</hi> are directed to <hi>cleanſe their way,</hi> by <hi>tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Heed thereto according to God's Word,</hi> Pſal. 119.9.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE keep the Rule over before you: and exerciſe your ſelves always to keep
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:002256_0152_0FDADE65C3A5C2F8"/>Conſciences void of Offence. It was <hi>David</hi>'s Reſolution in his Early Days, (Pſal. 101.2.) <hi>I will behave my ſelf</hi> wiſely <hi>in a perfect way;</hi> And it ſhould be <hi>your</hi>'s. — Youth is apt to be Heady, Venturous, and Inadvertent, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten betrays into ſad Miſtakes and Miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. But be not you ſo. Be wary and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant. Reverence Conſcience, conſult much with it, &amp; be obſequious to all it's genuine Directions. Look well to your goings. Look about you, and take <hi>Example</hi> from the Wiſe, and <hi>Caution</hi> from the Fooliſh, and take Heed leſt you fall. Be ever ſenſible of Dangers; keep up a jealous Watch over your Hearts, and a ſtrict Guard over your Senſes, Appetites, and Paſſions. Keep your ſelves from your own Iniquity. Suppreſs the firſt Motions of Luſt. Fly the very Occaſions of Sin; the goodly <hi>Hebrew Youth</hi> thus ſecur'd his Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Remember Young <hi>Dinah</hi>'s Folly and Fall; and don't needleſly run into the way of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Be careful with <hi>whom</hi> you contract year <hi>Relations;</hi> take heed how you diſpoſe your ſelves in Apprenticeſhip, in Marriage, &amp;c. — Be careful in the Choice of a <hi>Calling,</hi> let it be One that has feweſt ſpiritual Snares, and will afford you moſt Advantages for your Souls; and therein ſtudy to order your Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs with Diſcretion, ſo as not to hurt your grand Intereſts.—Be careful in chuſing your <hi>Place of Abode;</hi> Endeavor to ſettle where you may have the beſt Opportunities and Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modations for promoting the Glory of GOD,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:002256_0153_0FDADE6B8879F7B8"/>and your own Spiritual Good.—Be watchuful over your ſelves in all <hi>Conditions;</hi> Some of you are born to Riches and Honour, Others to Want and Meanneſs. Let the <hi>Poor</hi> &amp; <hi>Afflicted</hi> among you watch againſt Diſcontent at the Diſpoſals of Divine Wiſdom &amp; Goodneſs; and againſt envying at the Proſperity of others; Begin now you are Young to learn the Art of Contentment; and this will have a happy Influence upon you all your Days. And thoſe that are <hi>Proſperous,</hi> and live in Eaſe, and make a Figure in the World; Let ſuch be thankful, and humble, and ſelf denying, Heavenly minded, and Fruitful in every good Work: and thus you will be prepard for whatever Changes there may be in the right Hand of the Moſt High.—Again, Be circumſpect in all matters of <hi>lawful Liberty;</hi> in which caſe Young Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple eſpecially are very apt to offend, &amp; as hard to be convine'd &amp; reclaimed. Take heed then to your ſelves in all Things (of an indifferent Nature,) that you act agreeably to the Laws of Charity, by the Rules of Decency &amp; of Expediency, and under the Reſtraints of Chriſtian Sobriety, and with a juſt Deference to the wiſe Counſels &amp; Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Parents &amp; Superiors.—See to it that your <hi>Diverſions</hi> be well principle'd and well regulated. Let them be ſuch as are of good Report among Us; let them be ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably enter'd on &amp; timely broken off; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately purſu'd; and well intended, to fit you the better for ſerving GOD, and your
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:002256_0153_0FDADE6B8879F7B8"/>Generation, which ſhould be your primary Delight &amp; Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, Be very Circumſpect as to your <hi>Company</hi> &amp; <hi>Converſation.</hi> Be careful in <hi>chuſing</hi> your Aſſociates. Don't degrade your ſelves with <hi>Nebuchalnezzet</hi> to herd with the Beaſts. Let a vile Perſon be contemned in your Eyes: but honour them that fear the Lord, and with <hi>David</hi> be a Companion of ſuch, as keep the Commandments of GOD, who are moſt likely to be Friends to your Souls, whoſe Fruit is a Tree of Life. <q>You may viſit wicked Perſons, as their <hi>Phyſicians:</hi> but not as their <hi>Companions,</hi> leſt you catch <hi>Infection</hi> from them.</q> Take ſuch for your Aſſociares, as may be Aſſiſtents to you in the Affairs of your Souls; and for a <hi>Special Friend</hi> I would adviſe Young People to chuſe One, that is of more <hi>Experience</hi> than them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſo capable to direct them; and one that is ſomething more <hi>advanced in Age</hi> and <hi>Rank,</hi> whoſe Preſence may carry ſome Awe with it, &amp; whoſe Admonitions may be of more weight.—And as you ſhould be circumſpect in <hi>chuſing</hi> your Acquaintants; ſo likewiſe in <hi>uſing</hi> of their Society. Be wiſe and wary in your Viſits, that theſe be not a fruitleſs Miſpenſe of Time. And in your occaſional Converſation at all Times en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour wiſely to introduce &amp; keep up pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Diſcourſe; and in your talk of Secular Affairs, let your Language be ſuch as may diſcover a godly ſimplicity, and ſhow that
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:002256_0154_0FDADE6C8798DAD0"/>the ſpirit of this World has not the Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent over you. This is to walk in Wiſdom. But if in Converſation your ſtudy is to pleaſe Men by appearing Worldly-wiſe, or facetions, and entertaining, rather than to approve your ſelves to GOD by being grave, pious and edi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ying, certainly now you walk not Circumſpectly, but as Fools. — Let Young Profeſſors then be exhorted to make their Acquaintance &amp; Converſe together as ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al &amp; profitable as may be.</p>
            <p>AND here I might add; Let ſuch Young People as live in the ſame Houſe or Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, by mutual Agreement oblige them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſpecial watch &amp; care over each other. Speak often one to another. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort your ſelves together, &amp; edify one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>even as alſo ye do.</hi> And watch over each other in Brotherly Love. Be faithful Monitors every one to his Brother; and let every one be ready to hearken to friendly Counſels &amp; Reproofs. When the Righteous ſmite thee, let it be a kindneſs; and let the wounds of a Friend be as excellent Oyl.</p>
            <p>THUS I have ſhown Young People in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inſtances how they are to walk Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly. And O that you would all be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded to endeavour it. In order to this, Conſider how you are oblig'd by your <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> &amp; <hi>Engagements</hi> thus to walk. Conſider alſo what <hi>Dangers</hi> &amp; <hi>Difficulties</hi> attend the Chriſtian Life, ariſing from inward Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and outward Oppoſitions; which call
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:002256_0154_0FDADE6C8798DAD0"/>for the exacteſt Care and greateſt Watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. You are ſetting out in a World full of Snares, and in an uncommon Day of Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; and without the greateſt Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection you will be in imminent Hazard of ſuch Falls into Sin, as will wound Conſcience, diſturb it's Peace and defile its Purity. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, Conſider; You are under the moſt <hi>cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Inſpection.</hi> The jealous Eye of an <hi>All-ſeeing GOD</hi> is upon you continually; who will be highly provoked if you are ſecure and negligent; which ſhould awe you, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, into the ſtricteſt watch over your Hearts &amp; Ways, that you may walk before Him unto all well-pleaſing. Again, The Eyes of <hi>Men</hi> are upon you. <hi>Good</hi> People have their Eye upon you; Their Deſire is toward you, their Delight in you, &amp; their Expectations from you great. This ſhou'd by a Principle of Ambition lead you to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in your Walk. But further, <hi>Wicked</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple look on you with an evil Eye: Theſe watch for your Halting; They'l be glad to ſee you careleſs, and they wiſh for your fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. This would rejoyce (as well as harden) them exceedingly. Again, The <hi>Devils</hi> keep an envious Eye over you; they obſerve you nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly; they are continually longing and labouring to enſnare you; if you are ſecure and heedleſs, you expoſe your ſelves to their ſubtil Devices; and if you fall by them, they'l triumph over you, inſult &amp; vex you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="58" facs="unknown:002256_0155_0FDADE6E29D06438"/>
BUT in the laſt place, Conſider the many <hi>Encouragements</hi> you have to be walking Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly. You have an unerring Rule to lead you: You have, to animate you, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, and of many Saints who were holy and wiſe in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour from their Youth: And you have all needful Aſſiſtance tender'd you: And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of great Rewards, which will by vaſt Exceſſes more than Counter-balance and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate for all the Cares and Pains of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect walk. In a word, This Chriſtian Vigilance and Prudence is the Strength and Beauty of the Soul. Therefore keep your Heart with all Diligence, that none take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way your Crown. Watch and Pray, leſt ye enter into Temptation. He that truſteth in his own Heart is a Fool, but whoſo walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth wiſely ſhall be delivered.</p>

En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to be Exemplary in all thoſe Things, which are acceptable to GOD and approved of Men, lovely, venerable, and praiſe-worthy. A bound and excell in all Inſtances of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi> Shew a profound Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of all that is ſacred; Be ſtrict in obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sabbath; Signalize your ſelves for a very reverent Regard to the holy Scriptures, and to the Miniſters of CHRIST, as Stewards of the Myſteries of GOD. Speak with Awe of GOD and holy Things, and exhibit the utmoſt Gravity in the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of GOD, a viſible Alacrity in His Service and a well-order'd Zeal for His Glory. And be of catholick Principles and a generous Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit as to the diſputable Points and leſſer Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Religion. And further Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor to excell in all <hi>Social</hi> Virtues and <hi>Relative</hi> Duties. Diſtinguiſh your ſelves for eminent Juſtice &amp; Uprightneſs in your Dealings; Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to Benefactors; Brotherly Kindneſs; Charity to the Poor; Peaceableneſs, and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, a forgiving Spirit, and Patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Injuries and Affronts; Meekneſs under Reproofs; Mildneſs in Diſputes; Tractable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Submiſſion to the Advice of Superiors: Dutifulneſs to Parents; Obedience to Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Fidelity to all Truſts; Modeſty in Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel, in Speech and Demeanour, &amp;c. Again, Study to excell in all more <hi>ſolitary</hi> Virtues;
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:002256_0156_0FDADE6F957921A0"/>Self-denial, Weanedneſs from the World, and Mortification to ſenſual Pleaſures; Frugality, and Temperance in Sleep, and Diet; Chaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Purity, and Reſerv'dneſs; Application to good Buſineſs and Induſtry therein, &amp;c. You ſhou'd endeavour to exceed and out ſhine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in theſe moral Qualifications &amp; Deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as well as in the Inſtances of more vital and eſſential Piety.</p>
            <p>Finally, BETIMES begin to ſtudy <hi>Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> Aim at being public Bleſſings in your Day. Young Converts are the Seed and Hope of the <hi>next</hi> Generation, as old Diſciples are the Defence &amp; Delight of the <hi>Preſent.</hi> Therefore begin Early to get fit for your Maſter's Uſe; get furniſh'd for and ready to every good work; cheriſh a public Spirit in your ſelves betimes, and do what little Services you are capable of in your reſpective Spheres now in the Days of your Youth. Shine as Lights in the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the School or College, in the Church, and in the Common-wealth: Shine as Bright as you can in your ſeveral Orbs, and ſtudy to be Diffuſive Bleſſings. Particularly endeavor to promote the Converſion of other Young People of your Acquaintance; &amp; take all proper Methods to cultivate good Beginnings in one another; according to the Advice before given.</p>
            <p>IN theſe and other Ways Young People ſhou'd ſtudy to honour the Goſpel, and adorn their Profeſſion. This you ſhou'd be led to from a Principle of <hi>Retaliation,</hi> conſidering how the Goſpel has been the Means of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:002256_0156_0FDADE6F957921A0"/>you to great Happineſs and Dignity: And alſo from a View to the <hi>Glory of GOD,</hi> which will be abundantly promoted by ſuch Carriage: and alſo from a Regard to your own <hi>Credit and Intereſt;</hi> Which Conſideration ſhou'd inſpire you (Methinks) with <hi>Heroick</hi> Reſolutions. But further this is what the <hi>Word of GOD</hi> expreſly <hi>enjoyns</hi> as the Duty of Young People; particularly in the 2d.

            <p>BUT to add only one Word; and I will Conclude,—</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>LET Young Saints endeavour to</hi> GROW <hi>in Grace.</hi> Furthermore then we beſeech you Young Men &amp; Brethren, and exhort you by the LORD JESUS, that as ye have received of Us how you ought to walk &amp; to pleaſe GOD, ſo ye wou'd <hi>abound</hi> more &amp; more.

GROWTH in pure &amp; practical Religion is the chief Bleſſing on this ſide the Heavenly Places: This is to grow in conformity to CHRIST, who has left us a perfect Example of Early Piety. This is to be changed into the Image of GOD from Glory to Glory. This is the way to grow in the Favour of GOD; and in the Comforts of the HOLY GHOST; in Uſefulneſs to the World; in Ripe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for Heaven, Aſſurance of Salvation, and a Capacity for more exalted Degrees of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Bliſs and Glory. Surely then the thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſtian is the <hi>wiſeſt,</hi> the <hi>nobleſt,</hi> the <hi>richeſt,</hi> &amp; <hi>happieſt</hi> Creature out of Paradiſe. To flouriſh &amp; increaſe in Holineſs is infinitely preferrible to the higheſt Advances in the wealth and wiſdom of this World, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour among Men.</p>
            <p>AND now <hi>That</hi> is what <hi>GOD demands</hi> and expects from you.

               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:002256_0160_0FDADE7A0B136B30"/>
THAT <hi>the Sons of Good Men do not always walk in the Good Ways which their Fathers have walked in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE ſhall conſider this DOCTRINE in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Propoſitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Firſt Propoſition. <hi>All Good Men do walk in the ſame way.</hi> It is that which is called the <hi>way of Good Men,</hi> Prov. 2.20. <hi>Walk in the way of good Men, and keep the paths of the righteous.</hi> It is alſo called the <hi>Old Way,</hi> and the <hi>way that is holy,</hi> (Jer. 6.16.) It is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe called, <hi>The way Everlaſting,</hi> (Pſal. 139.24.) becauſe Good Men have <hi>always walked</hi> in that way; from the beginning of the World Good Men have always choſen to <hi>walk</hi> in that <hi>way; Choſen</hi> that <hi>Way of Truth,</hi> laying the <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of GOD before them.</p>
            <p>Particularly Firſt; IT is the <hi>Way of Piety.</hi> They have always like <hi>Samuel Worſhipped God</hi> and Him <hi>only;</hi> and have been careful not to <hi>take the Name of GOD in vain;</hi> and have <hi>Sanctifyed the holy Sabbaths</hi> of GOD: Yea, <hi>Sanctifying the Sabbath</hi> is indeed ſo great a part of <hi>Piety</hi> that it is put for <hi>all Religion,</hi> (Iſai. 58.13.)</p>
            <p>Secondly, IT is the <hi>way of Righteouſneſs.</hi> They are conſcienciouſly careful to obſerve the <hi>Firſt Table</hi> of the <hi>Moral</hi> Law, and the <hi>Second Table</hi> alſo. Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> could ſay, Acts 24.16. <hi>Herein do I exerciſe my ſelf to have always a Conſcience void of effence toward God and toward Men.</hi> Thus it was with <hi>Samuel;</hi> he was <hi>upright,</hi> he could <hi>appeal</hi> to the People as in the 12th. Chapter of this Book; <hi>Have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002256_0160_0FDADE7A0B136B30"/>wronged any Man?</hi> And they <hi>all</hi> ſaid, <hi>No, thou haſt wronged no Man.</hi> But then <hi>his Sons,</hi> they were very <hi>unrighteous;</hi> they did run after <hi>Filthy Lucre,</hi> they <hi>took bribes;</hi> they <hi>perverted Judgment;</hi> which was quite contrary to what their Father did.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, IT is the Way of <hi>Prayerfulneſs.</hi> Thus <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaid to the People; <hi>God forbid that I ſhould ceaſe to pray for you.</hi> Good Men are <hi>Praying</hi> Men. Pſal. 24.6. <hi>This is the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them that ſeek him.</hi> They that ſeek the Face of GOD are the <hi>Generation</hi> that belong to Him Yea, there is not one <hi>Godly Man</hi> in all the World but what is a <hi>Praying Man.</hi> Pſal. 32.6. <hi>For this ſhall every one that is godly pray unto thee.</hi> As for thoſe that are <hi>Prayerleſs,</hi> they are mention'd among the <hi>workers of Iniquity,</hi> (Pſal. 14.4.) If they are Prayerleſs they are ſo to be accounted. Thus we ſee in ſhort, the <hi>Good Ways,</hi> that <hi>Good Men</hi> are forever found walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in; The ways of a <hi>Samuel!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. II. THE <hi>Children</hi> of Godly Men have <hi>peculiar Advantages</hi> to ſerve the <hi>God of their Fathers,</hi> and walk in the <hi>Good Ways</hi> which their <hi>Fathers</hi> walked in: Divers Advantages which <hi>other Children</hi> in the World have not. As now,</p>
            <p>Firſt, THEY have the <hi>Scriptures;</hi> they have the <hi>Word of God</hi> to direct them in the way of Life &amp; Salvation. As is ſaid concerning the <hi>Jews,</hi> Rom. 3.1, 2. <hi>What advantage hath the Jew? much every way; chiefly in that unto them were committed the Oracles of God.</hi> They had the Holy Scriptures. Thus it was ſaid of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002256_0161_0FDADE7B8E5AA308"/>
               <hi>Timothy:</hi> he was advantaged in that reſpect above others, 2 Tim. 3.15. <hi>From a Child thou haſt known the Holy Scriptures which are able to make wiſe unto Salvation.</hi> They have alſo the Word of God <hi>Preached</hi> unto them; as the <hi>written Word</hi> of God, ſo the <hi>Goſpel Preached</hi> unto them: That is a great Advantage; the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Goſpel is the ordinary means by which true <hi>Faith</hi> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is wrought in the Souls of His Elect. Rom. 10.27. <hi>Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> In that regard, the Children of Godly Men have ſpecial Advantages to <hi>know the God of their Fathers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; THEY are the Subjects of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rental Inſtructions,</hi> they are taught by their Parents how they ought to ſerve God. Thus the Lord required his People of Old; <hi>Thou ſhalt teach thy Children diligently my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> Deut. 6.7. And in Pſal. 78.5, 6. it is there ſaid, <hi>They ſhould teach their Childdren from one generation to another.</hi> And the Lord ſaid concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 18.19. <hi>I know Abraham, that he will teach his Children to keep the way of the Lord.</hi> Now they that are the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi> will do the <hi>Works of Abraham.</hi> So we find the Servants of God have always done. <hi>David,</hi> he taught his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> &amp; his other Children. He ſaid, Pſal. 34.11. <hi>Come ye Children, hearken unto me, I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</hi> And his Son <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, Prov. 4.3, 4. <hi>I was my fathers ſon, he taught me.</hi> So did his Godly <hi>Mother</hi> too, ſhe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002256_0161_0FDADE7B8E5AA308"/>was careful to Inſtruct him. We read how his Godly Mother Inſtructed him. Prov. 31.2. <hi>What? my ſon, and what? the ſon of my vows?</hi> Said ſhe, I have <hi>Vowed</hi> and <hi>Prayed</hi> to God ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a time for thee, and wilt thou not hear the Counſel of her that has ſo often <hi>Prayed</hi> for thee and <hi>Vowed</hi> and offer'd many Sacrifices to God on thy behalf?</p>
            <p>Thirdly. THE People of GOD, put up many <hi>Prayers</hi> for their Children, that God would give them His Grace; they <hi>Pray</hi> at that rate, 1 Chron. 29.19. <hi>Give unto Solomon my ſon a perfect heart.</hi> Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> Prayed for <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> and God ſaid, <hi>concerning Iſhmael I have heard thee.</hi> Their Advantages are Peculiar in that reſpect, in that they are <hi>Prayed for.</hi> Laſtly, They have the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of their <hi>Parents;</hi> which is not a light thing. The <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of a <hi>Father</hi> is not to be deſpiſed; it ought to be regarded. We ſee <hi>Eſau</hi> as bad as he was, yet when he ſaw he was deprived of his <hi>Father Bleſſing,</hi> be <hi>Wept, and made a great and bitter Cry</hi> upon it. Verily, 'tis a Conſiderable, a Valuable Thing for Children to have their pious Parents, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring and pronouncing of <hi>Bleſſings</hi> upon them in the Name of the LORD. So that the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> of <hi>Godly Parents</hi> have Advantages which <hi>other Children</hi> in the World are Strangers to.</p>
            <p>PROP. III. <hi>MANY</hi> Children of Godly Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, do prove Godly too, and walk in the <hi>Good Ways</hi> of their Parents; yet it is too often ſadly otherwiſe. Some well Obſerve, God has ſo caſt the <hi>Line of Election</hi> that for the moſt
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002256_0162_0FDADE8111A4C8E0"/>part it runs through the Loins of <hi>Godly Parents.</hi> The 2d Epiſtle of <hi>John</hi> is, <hi>to the elect lady</hi> and her <hi>Children.</hi> If ſo be the Mother is <hi>elected</hi> there is more Hope and Encouragement that the Children belong to the <hi>Election</hi> too. We read, Pſal. 103.17. <hi>The mercy of the Lord is from everlaſting to everlaſting upon them that fear him, his righteouſneſs unto childrens children.</hi> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> ſays concerning <hi>Timothy,</hi> [2 Tim. 1.5.] <hi>I am perſwaded</hi> ſays he, <hi>that Faith is in thee;</hi> that thou art a true Believer; when I call to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance the <hi>Faith</hi> that was in thy <hi>Grand-mother Lois,</hi> and thy <hi>Mother Eunice.</hi> Thy <hi>Grand-mother</hi> was a Godly Woman, thy <hi>Mother</hi> an holy Woman; therefore I cannot but Hope the more for thee. Doubtleſs, if an account of it were taken, it would be found that the <hi>greateſt part</hi> of ſuch as belong to God have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from <hi>Godly Parents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. IV. BUT ſtill the Grace of God is <hi>Sovereign.</hi> It is not engaged to any <hi>Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Family;</hi> He is <hi>free</hi> in the Diſpoſing of his Grace. He ſays, Exod. 33.19. <hi>I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will ſhew mercy on whom I will ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w mercy.</hi> So that many <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren</hi> that deſcend from Godly Parents are not Godly but much otherwiſe, this is a ſad Truth. And now, will Firſt, Show the <hi>Proof</hi> of it; then <hi>inquire whence</hi> it comes to paſs. For the <hi>Proof</hi> of it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. WE find in the Scripture <hi>Particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> many of them did degenerate from the Faith of their Forefathers. Let us look back
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002256_0162_0FDADE8111A4C8E0"/>as far as <hi>Adam</hi>'s Family, and we ſhall find it ſo. <hi>Adam</hi> had a Godly Son whoſe Name was <hi>Seth,</hi> now the Poſterity of that Godly Son in proceſs of Time did Degenerate and became as the reſt of the World, Gen. 6.2. <hi>The ſons of God ſaw the daughters of men.</hi> The <hi>Sons of God,</hi> that is to ſay the Poſterity of Godly <hi>Seth;</hi> they did Degenerate and became like the reſt of the World. <hi>Noah</hi> had a Godly Son, <hi>ſcil. Shem,</hi> but this Man's Poſterity did ſadly Degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; Notice is taken of it, that they became <hi>Idolaters,</hi> [Joſh. 24.2.] In <hi>Abrahams</hi> Family there was an <hi>Iſhmael</hi> that would Scoff at his Brother who was a Godly Man. In <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was an <hi>Eſau</hi> who was a prophane Perſon. So ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>Take heed leſt there be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you a prophane perſon like unto Eſau that for a meſs of pottage ſold his birthright.</hi> In <hi>David</hi>'s Family; How many wicked Sons ſprung up in that good Man's Family! An <hi>Amnon,</hi> who Committed Inceſt with his own Siſter; An <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalom</hi> that Murdered his Brother <hi>Amnon,</hi> and after that would have Murdered his own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to have gained the Kingdom! Is it not ſaid of <hi>Nabal,</hi> who was a <hi>drunken Sot,</hi> that he was of <hi>the houſe of Caleb?</hi> [1 Sam. 25.3.] A ſad thing that ſo vile a wretch as <hi>Nabal</hi> was ſhould deſcend from ſuch an houſe as <hi>Calebs</hi> was! <hi>Joſiah</hi> was a Godly Man; yet his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>all of them bad!</hi> God ſaid to one of them, <hi>Did not thy Father do judgment and juſtice! But thine heart is for thy Covetouſneſs.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. IT is true concerning <hi>whole Generations.</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:002256_0163_0FDADE8248690F98"/>Sometimes <hi>whole Generations</hi> have Apoſtatized from God and become exceeding Sinful in his Sight; So when <hi>Joſhua</hi> was Dead it is ſaid, Judg. 2.10. <hi>There aroſe another generation which knew not the Lord, nor the works which he had done.</hi> A <hi>whole Generation</hi> did Degenerate from the Piety of their Fathers that had gone before them. <hi>I planted thee a noble Vine, but how art thou degenerate, ſaith the Lord?</hi> Jer. 2.25.</p>
            <p>BUT now Secondly; <hi>Whence</hi> is it that <hi>god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Men ſometimes have very <hi>ungodly Children!</hi> For anſwer; Firſt: The Children of godly Men are <hi>born Sinful,</hi> as well as the Children of <hi>other Men.</hi> They have <hi>Original Corruption</hi> in them as much as others have. Hence <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſays, Pſal. 51.5. <hi>I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> Yet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s Mother was a Singular good Woman; a very holy Woman. <hi>David</hi> when he prayed to God, ſays, <hi>Remember the Son of thine hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid:</hi> his Father <hi>Jeſſe</hi> alſo was a very holy Man; the Jews call him, <hi>Jeſſe the Righteous:</hi> And have ſuch an Opinion of him, that they Hyperbolically ſay, the <hi>Angel of Death</hi> could find no Sin, but that of our <hi>Firſt Parents,</hi> to charge him with. The Son of a <hi>godly Father,</hi> and a <hi>godly Mother,</hi> yet was <hi>conceived</hi> in <hi>Sin and ſhapen in Iniquity.</hi> Such are as apt to Sin as the Children of ungodly Men; they are apt to <hi>tell lies as ſcon as they are born:</hi> when they commit a Fault they are <hi>apt to tell a Lie,</hi> becauſe of the Corruption which is natural to them; yea, they are <hi>Inventers of evil
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002256_0163_0FDADE8248690F98"/>things,</hi> Rom. 1.30. They are apt to commit ſuch Sins, as never any did before them. They are apt to do amifs and to fall in with the Ways of Sin.</p>
            <p>Secondly. THIS comes to paſs from the Malice of <hi>Satan,</hi> that does what he can to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the Churches. Among the <hi>Wheat</hi> there ſprings up a world of <hi>Tares.</hi> How comes this to paſs? Why ſays the Text, <hi>an Enemy has done it.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> is that <hi>Enemy;</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> is an <hi>Enemy</hi> to Purity in Churches; he would have Churches to be like the reſt of the World: Therefore he ſows <hi>Tares</hi> in the Lord's Field. He does it, in the <hi>Degeneracy</hi> that he Labours to introduce among the <hi>Children of the Covenant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly. IT comes to paſs from the <hi>remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi> of Eminent Servants of GOD. Thus when <hi>Moſes</hi> was going to be taken away, <hi>I know,</hi> ſays he, <hi>after my Death there will be great</hi> chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges among you. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> when going from <hi>Epheſus,</hi> ſays, <hi>after my Departure there will come grievous wolves among you.</hi> And how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten is it ſaid in the book of <hi>Judges, while the good Judges continued,</hi> things went well, but <hi>when thoſe good Judges were dead,</hi> and removed out of the Way, they preſently Degenerated, and became like the reſt of the World; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came guilty of ſuch Sins as others in the World were Guilty of. Thus we ſee the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> cleared in the Particulars that have been mentioned.</p>

               <p n="1">I. HENCE we ſee, Men ought not to ſet their Hearts inordinately upon their <hi>Children.</hi> Indeed they are apt to do ſo; apt to promiſe themſelves much comfort in their Children. We ſee it in <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſays he, <hi>Lord, what wilt give one, ſeeing I go Childleſs?</hi> And it is threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned as a Judgment, ſuch a Man ſhall <hi>die Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</hi> We ſee it in <hi>Rachel, Give me Children or elſe I die:</hi> God <hi>gave</hi> her <hi>Children,</hi> and <hi>ſhe died</hi> for it: And when her <hi>Soul was departing,</hi> ſhe called his name <hi>Benoni,</hi> that is, <hi>the Child of my Affliction.</hi> Indeed when the <hi>Children</hi> of the Faithful <hi>die</hi> in their <hi>Infancy,</hi> there is cauſe to Hope they are Saved becauſe of the <hi>Covenant</hi> of GOD; the Covenant of Grace which they have not Violated. But when they <hi>Out Live</hi> their <hi>Infancy,</hi> and become Wicked and Vile, the caſe is much otherwiſe. Wherefore <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> who know not how their Children may prove, ſhould not ſet their Hearts inordinate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon their <hi>Children. Who knows,</hi> but that <hi>Child</hi> thou art ſo fond of may prove to thee as <hi>Eſau</hi> did to <hi>Rebecca</hi> and to his <hi>Father?</hi> He was a <hi>grief of Mind</hi> to them both. And <hi>Rebec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> ſaid, <hi>I am weary of my Life becauſe of the Daughters of Heth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. IF the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Good Men</hi> may prove <hi>ungodly,</hi> no wonder that the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>unged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men</hi> do ſo. <hi>Children</hi> are more apt to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their Parents in that which is <hi>Evil,</hi> than in that which is <hi>Good.</hi> Jer. 7.18. <hi>The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002256_0164_0FDADE83C538DA60"/>women knead the dough to make cakes to the queen of heaven.</hi> Abominable! To <hi>make cakes to the queen of heaven;</hi> to Worſhip the <hi>Moon!</hi> yet when <hi>Parents</hi> did ſo, the <hi>Children</hi> did ſo too; and no wonder they did. The <hi>Samaritans</hi> that ſucceeded thoſe that were carried Captive, they Worſhipped graven Images and Served other gods; <hi>as their Fathers did, ſo did their Children, and their Childrens Children; as did their Fathers ſo do they unto this Day,</hi> 2 King. 17.41. Thoſe Children that did mock the holy Prophet <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that ſaid, <hi>go up thou bald head; go up thou bald head;</hi> thou ſayeſt thy Maſter <hi>Elijah</hi> is <hi>gone up</hi> to Heaven; <hi>do thou go after him;</hi> would theſe <hi>Children</hi> have done ſo, if they had not ſeen the Iniquity of their <hi>Fathers?</hi> Doubtleſs their Fathers were guilty of the like Iniquity.</p>
               <p n="3">III. <hi>WE may ſee by this, it is not in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Parents to give Grace to their Children.</hi> They may give them what they have of this World; but that's all. To have <hi>Grace</hi> given to them, it is a thouſand times better, far more deſireable than to have a portion of <hi>this Worlds Goods.</hi> But this is more than <hi>they</hi> can Give. They can't give them <hi>Sanctifying Grace;</hi> they can't give them <hi>true Repentance;</hi> that is the <hi>Gift of GOD,</hi> not of their <hi>Parents.</hi> They can't give them <hi>Faith</hi> in JESUS CHRIST; no <hi>that,</hi> none but <hi>GOD</hi> can give. A godly Man can no more make his <hi>Children godly</hi> than he can <hi>Raiſe the Dead</hi> out of their Graves: It is none but God can do it: <hi>He</hi> alone muſt have the Praiſe and Glory of it.</p>

IV. IT is not ſafe for <hi>Children</hi> to build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on having an <hi>Abraham</hi> for their <hi>Father.</hi> Mat. 3.9. <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves we have Abraham for our Father.</hi> This is a Foundation not to be built upon, thou mayſt have a <hi>Father</hi> as good a Man as <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet Periſh for ever in thy Unbelief. How was it with one who died and went to <hi>Hell,</hi> and when <hi>in Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> there he cried out, <hi>Father Abraham have mercy on me!</hi> This Child of <hi>Abraham</hi> in Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, adds, <hi>I have five Brethren alive in the World, O that one might go from the Dead,</hi> and tell them what a terrible place <hi>Hell</hi> is, that they mayn't come into this <hi>place of Torment.</hi> Why? Is there any <hi>Charity</hi> in <hi>Hell?</hi> No, but they know if their <hi>Brethren</hi> come there it would be worſe for them, an aggravation of their Miſery! Therefore hebeg'd, O <hi>let not them come here!</hi> Well then, you that are the <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Godly Parents,</hi> I ſhall Speak a Solemn Word unto you. If thou Liveſt and Dieſt in thine <hi>Impenitency</hi> thou ſhalt have the moſt <hi>ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Witneſſes</hi> againſt thee. Thy <hi>Father,</hi> and thy <hi>Mother</hi> that Lov'd thee ſo Dearly, that has wept and prayed for thee ſo many times, thy <hi>Father,</hi> and thy <hi>Mother,</hi> they will Condemn thee, they will Juſtify GOD in Condemning of thee: <hi>they</hi> will join with the LORD in paſſing a Sentence of Eternal Condemnation upon thee at the Laſt Day; and ſay, like the Angel in the <hi>Revelations, Thou art Righteous in that Thou haſt ſo Judged:</hi> Thus it will be ſaid at the Laſt Day: Thy <hi>Father,</hi> and thy <hi>Mother</hi> will ſay,

                  <hi>Lord I Concur with Thee, thou art Righteous in paſſing a Sentence of Eternal Condemnation upon this Child of mine; I warn'd him many a Time to Repent and turn to God, but he would not, ſo that Thou art Righteous in all that is come upon him.</hi>
