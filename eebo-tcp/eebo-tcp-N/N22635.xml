            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS hiſtory, taking in ſuch a variety of facts and opinions, has grown under my hand; eſpecially as in writing I cannot avoid entering into ſome deſultory diſquiſitions, and deſcriptions of manners and things which, though not ſtrictly neceſſary to elucidate the events, are intimately connected with the main object; I have alſo been led into ſeveral theoretical inveſtigations, whilſt marking the political effects that naturally flow from the progreſs of knowledge. It is probable, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that this work will be extended to two or three more volumes, a conſiderable part of which is already written.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE revolution in France exhibits a ſcene, in the political world, not leſs novel and intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the contraſt is ſtriking between the narrow opinions of ſuperſtition, and the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened ſentiments of maſculine and improved phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</p>
            <p>To mark the prominent features of this revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, requires a mind, not only unſophiſticated by old prejudices, and the inveterate habits of degeneracy; but an amelioration of temper, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the exerciſe of the moſt enlarged prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of humanity.</p>
            <p>The rapid changes, the violent, the baſe, and nefarious aſſaſſinations, which have clouded the vivid proſpect that began to ſpread a ray of joy and gladneſs over the gloomy horizon of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, cannot fail to chill the ſympathizing boſom, and palſy intellectual vigour. To ſketch theſe viciſſitudes is a taſk ſo arduous and melancholy,

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ature, it becomes neceſſary to guard againſt the erroneous inferences of ſenſibility; and reaſon beaming on the grand theatre of political changes can prove the only ſure guide to direct us to a favourable or juſt concluſion.</p>
            <p>This important concluſion, involving the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and exaltation of the human character, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſerious and mature conſideration; as it muſt ultimately ſink the dignity of ſociety into contempt, and its members into greater wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or elevate it to a degree of grandeur not hitherto anticipated, but by the moſt enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtateſmen and philoſophers.</p>
            <p>Contemplating then theſe ſtupendous events with the cool eye of obſervation, the judgment difficult to be preſerved unwarped under the preſſure of the calamitous horrors produced by deſperate and enraged factions, will continually perceive that it is the uncontaminated maſs of the French nation, whoſe minds begin to graſp the ſentiments of freedom, that has ſecured the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>librium of the ſtate; often tottering on the brink of annihilation; in ſpite of the folly, ſelfiſhneſs, madneſs, treachery, and more fatal mock patriot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, the common reſult of depraved manners,
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:029916_0005_0FE308EB8E58C290"/>
the concomitant of that ſervility and volup tuouſneſs which for ſo long a ſpace of time has embruted the higher orders of this celebrated nation.</p>
            <p>By thus attending to circumſtances, we ſhall be able to diſcern clearly that the revolution was neither produced by the abilities or intrigues of a few individuals; nor was the effect of ſudden and ſhort-lived enthuſiaſm; but the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of intellectual improvement, gradually proceeding to perfection in the advancement of communities, from a ſtate of barbariſm to that of poliſhed ſociety, till now arrived at the point when ſincerity of principles ſeem to be haſtening the overthrow of the tremendous empire of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition and hypocriſy, erected upon the ruins of gothic brutality and ignorance.</p>

                  <pb n="2" facs="unknown:029916_0014_0FE3093B5FE4C3B0"/>The perfection attained by the ancients, it is true, has ever afforded the imagination of the poetical hiſtorian a theme to deck with the choiceſt flowers of rhetoric; though the cool inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of facts ſeems clearly to prove, that the civilization of the world, hitherto, has conſiſted rather in cultivating the taſte, than in exerciſing the underſtanding. And were not theſe vaunted improvements alſo confined to a ſmall corner of the globe, whilſt, the political view of the wiſeſt legiſlators ſeldom extending beyond the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and aggrandizement of their individual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they trampled with a ferocious affectation of patriotiſm on the moſt ſacred rights of humanity? When the arts flouriſhed in Greece, and litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture began to ſhed it's blandiſhments on ſociety, the world was moſtly inhabited by barbarians, who waged eternal war with their more poliſhed neighbours, the imperfection of whoſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſapping it's foundation, the ſcience of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics neceſſarily received a check in the bud—and when we find, likewiſe, the roman empire crum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling into atoms, from the germ of a deadly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady implanted in it's vitals; whilſt voluptuouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtopped the progreſs of civilization, which makes the perfection of the arts the dawn of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; we ſhall be convinced, that it demanded ages of improving reaſon and experience in moral philoſophy, to clear away the rubbiſh, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the firſt principles of ſocial order.</p>
               <p>We have probably derived our great ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over thoſe nations from the diſcovery of the polar attraction of the needle, the perfection which aſtronomy and mathematics have attained, and the fortunate invention of printing. For,

whilſt the revival of letters has added the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected wiſdom of antiquity to the improvements of modern reſearch, the latter moſt uſeful art has rapidly multiplied copies of the productions of genius and compilations of learning, bringing them within the reach of all ranks of men: the ſcientific diſcoveries alſo have not only led us to new worlds; but, facilitating the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between different nations, the friction of arts and commerce have given to ſociety the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendently pleaſing poliſh of urbanity; and thus, by a gradual ſoftening of manners, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of ſocial life has been completely changed. But the remains of ſuperſtition, and the unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural diſtinction of privileged cl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Locke, following the track of theſe bold think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, recommended in a more methodical manner religious toleration, and analyzed the principles of civil liberty: for in his definition of liberty we find the elements of <hi>The Declaration of the Rights of Man,</hi> which, in ſpite of the fatal errors of ignorance, and the perverſe obſtinacy of ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is now converting ſublime theories into practical truths.</p>

               <p>Engliſhmen were then, with reaſon, proud of their conſtitution; and, if this noble pride hath degenerated into arrogance, when the cauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came leſs conſpicuous, it is only a venial lapſe of human nature; to be lamented merely as it ſtops the progreſs of civilization, and leads the people to imagine, that their anceſtors have done every thing poſſible to ſecure the happineſs of ſociety, and meliorate the condition of man, becauſe they have done much.</p>

has the liberty of man been reſtrained; and the ſpontaneous flow of his feelings, which would have fertilized his mind, being choked at the ſource, he is rendered in the ſame degree unhappy as he is made unnatural. Yet, certain opinions, planted by ſuperſtition and deſpotiſm, hand in hand, have taken ſuch deep root in our habits of thinking, it may appear daringly licentious, as well as preſumptuous, to obſerve, that what is often termed virtue, is only want of courage to throw off prejudices, and follow the inclinations which fear not the eye of heaven, though they ſhrink from cenſure not founded on the natural principles of morality. But at no period has the ſcanty diffuſion of knowledge permitted the body of the people to participate in the diſcuſſion of political ſcience; and if philoſophy at length hath ſimplified the principles of ſocial union, ſo as to render them eaſy to be comprehended by every ſane and thinking being; it appears to me, that man may contemplate with benevolent compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency and becoming pride, the approaching reign of reaſon and peace.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if men have been rendered unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to judge with preciſion of their civil and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical rights, from the involved ſtate in which ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticating ignorance has placed them, and thus reduced to ſurrender their reaſoning powers to noble fools, and pedantic knaves, it is not ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſuperficial obſervers have formed opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions unfavourable to the degree of perfection, which our intellectual faculties are able to attain, or that deſpotiſm ſhould attempt to check the ſpirit of inquity, which, with coloſſian ſtrides, ſeems to be haſtening the overthrow of oppreſſive tyranny and contumelious ambition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:029916_0018_0FE30947939A0160"/>Nature having made men unequal, by giving ſtronger bodily and mental powers to one than to another, the end of government ought to be, to deſtroy this inequality by protecting the weak. Inſtead of which, it has always leaned to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite ſide, wearing itſelf out by diſregarding the firſt principle of it's organization.</p>
               <p>It appears to be the grand province of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, though ſcarcely acknowledged, ſo to hold the balance, that the abilities or riches of individuals may not interfere with the equili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brium of the whole. For as it is vain to expect, that men ſhould maſter their paſſions during the heat of action, legiſlators ſhould have this perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of laws ever in view, when, calmly graſping the intereſt of humanity, reaſon aſſures them, that their own is beſt ſecured by the ſecurity of the common weal. The firſt ſocial ſyſtems were certainly ſounded by paſſion; individuals wiſhing to fence round their own wealth or power, and make ſlaves of their brothers to prevent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachment. Their deſcendants have ever been at work to ſolder the chains they forged, and render the uſurpations of ſtrength ſecure, by the fraud of partial laws: laws that can be abrogated only by the exertions of reaſon, emancipating mankind, by making government a ſcience, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a craft, and civilizing the grand maſs, by exerciſing their underſtandings about the moſt important objects of inquiry.</p>
               <p>After the revolution in 1688, however, politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal queſtions were no longer diſcuſſed in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land on a broad ſcale; becauſe that degree of liberty was enjoyed, which enabled thinking men to purſue without interruption their own buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; or, if ſome men complained, they attached

               <p>But in France the bitterneſs of oppreſſion was mingled in the daily cup, and the ſerious folly of ſuperſtition, pampered by the ſweat of labour, ſtared every man of ſenſe in the face.

               <p>But men are not content merely to laugh at oppreſſion, when they can ſcarcely catch from his gripe the neceſſaries of life; ſo that from writing epigrams on ſuperſtition, the galled French began to compoſe philippics againſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm. The enormous and iniquitous taxes, which the nobles, the clergy, and the monarch, levied on the people, turned the attention of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence to this main branch of government, and the profound treatiſe of the humane M.

away like the dew of the morning, dazzling the eyes of its admirers? Why?—becauſe it was factitious virtue.</p>
               <p>During the period they had to combat againſt oppreſſion, and rear an infant ſtate, what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of heroiſm do not the annals of Greece and Rome diſplay! But it was merely the blaze of paſſion, "live ſmoke;" for after vanquiſhing their enemies, and making the moſt aſtoniſhing ſacrifices to the glory of their country, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came civil tyrants, and preyed on the very ſociety, for whoſe welfare it was eaſier to die, than to practiſe the ſober duties of life, which inſinuate through it the contentment that is rather felt than ſeen. Like the parents who forget all the dictates of juſtice and humanity, to aggrandize the very children whom they keep in a ſtate of dependence, theſe heroes loved their country, becauſe it was their country, ever ſhowing by their conduct, that it was only a part of a narrow love of themſelves.</p>
               <p>It is time, that a more enlightened moral love of mankind ſhould ſupplant, or rather ſupport phyſical affections. It is time, that the youth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching manhood ſhould be led by princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and not hurried along by ſenſations—and then we may expect, that the heroes of the preſent generation, ſtill having their monſters to cope with, will labour to eſtabliſh ſuch rational laws throughout the world, that men will not reſt in the dead letter, or become artificial beings as they become civilized.</p>
               <p>We muſt get entirely clear of all the notions drawn from the wild traditions of original ſin: the eating of the apple, the theft of Prometheus,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029916_0025_0FE30911EEFF6328"/>
the opening of Pandora's box, and the other fables, too tedious to enumerate, on which prieſts have erected their tremendous ſtructures of impoſition, to perſuade us, that we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally inclined to evil: we ſhall then leave room for the expanſion of the human heart, and, I truſt, find, that men will inſenſibly render each other happier as they grow wiſer. It is indeed the neceſſity of ſtifling many of its moſt ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous deſires, to obtain the factitious virtues of ſociety, that makes man vicious, by depriving him of that dignity of character, which reſts only on truth. For it is not paradoxical to aſſert, that the ſocial virtues are nipt in the bud by the very laws of ſociety. One principle of action is ſufficient—Reſpect thyſelf—whether it be termed fear of God—religion; love of juſtice—morality; or, ſelf-love—the deſire of happineſs. Yet, how can a man reſpect himſelf; and if not, how be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the exiſtence of virtue; when he is prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing the daily ſhifts, which do not come under the cogniſance of the law, in order to obtain a reſpectable ſituation in life? It ſeems, in fact, to be the buſineſs of a civilized man, to harden his heart, that on it he may ſharpen the wit; which, aſſuming the appellation of ſagacity, or cunning, in different characters, is only a proof, that the head is clear, becauſe the heart is cold.</p>
               <p>Beſides, one great cauſe of miſery in the preſent imperfect ſtate of ſociety is, that the imagination, continually tantalized, becomes the inflated wen of the mind, draining off the nouriſhment from the vital parts. Nor would it, I think, be ſtretching the inference too far, to inſiſt, that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029916_0026_0FE3095320D9E1B0"/>
men become vicious in the ſame proportion as they are obliged, by the defects of ſociety, to ſubmit to a kind of ſelf-denial, which ignorance, not morals, preſcribes.</p>
               <p>But theſe evils are paſſing away; a new ſpirit has gone forth, to organiſe the body-politic; and where is the criterion to be found, to eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate the means, by which the influence of this ſpirit can be confined, now enthroned in the hearts of half the inhabitants of the globe? Reaſon has, at laſt, ſhown her captivating face, beaming with benevolence; and it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for the dark hand of deſpotiſm again to obſcure its radiance, or the lurking dagger of ſubordinate tyrants to reach her boſom. The image of God implanted in our nature is now more rapidly expanding; and, as it opens, liberty with maternal wing, ſeems to be ſoaring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions far above vulgar annoyance, promiſing to ſhelter all mankind.</p>
               <p>It is a vulgar error, built on a ſuperficial view of the ſubject, though it ſeems to have the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of experience, that civilization can only go as far as it has hitherto gone, and then muſt neceſſarily fall back into barbariſm. Yet thus much appears certain, that a ſtate will infallibly grow old and feeble, if hereditary riches ſupport hereditary rank, under any deſcription. But when courts and primogeniture are done away, and ſimple equal laws are eſtabliſhed, what is to prevent each generation from retaining the vigour of youth?—What can weaken the body or mind, when the great majority of ſociety muſt exerciſe both, to earn a ſubſiſtence, and acquire reſpectability?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:029916_0027_0FE3090490F61638"/>The French revolution is a ſtrong proof how far things will govern men, when ſimple prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples begin to act with one powerful ſpring againſt the complicated wheels of ignorance; numerous in proportion to their weakneſs, and conſtantly wanting repair, becauſe expedients of the moment are ever the ſpawn of cowardly folly, or the narrow calculations of ſelfiſhneſs. To elucidate this truth, it is not neceſſary to rake among the aſhes of barbarous ambition; to ſhow the ignorance and conſequent folly of the monarchs, who ruled with a rod of iron, when the hordes of European ſavages began to form their governments; though the review of this portion of hiſtory would clearly prove, that narrowneſs of mind naturally produces ferociouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of temper.</p>
               <p>We may boaſt of the poetry of thoſe ages, and of thoſe charming flights of imagination, which, during the paroxyſms of paſſion, flaſh out in thoſe ſingle acts of heroic virtue, that throw a luſtre over a whole thoughtleſs life; but the cultivation of the underſtanding, in ſpite of theſe northern lights, appears to be the only way to t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the body is ſtrong, and the blood warm, men do not like to think, or adopt any plan of conduct, unleſs broken-in by degrees: the force that has often ſpent itſelf in fatal activity becomes a rich ſource of energy of mind.</p>
               <p>Men exclaim, only noticing the evil, againſt the luxury introduced with the arts and ſciences; when it is obviouſly the cultivation of theſe alone,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:029916_0028_0FE309556F4CE6E8"/>
emphatically termed the arts of peace, that can turn the ſword into a plough-ſhare. War is the adventure naturally purſued by the idle, and it requires ſomething of this ſpecies, to excite the ſtrong emotions neceſſary to rouſe inactive minds. Ignorant people, when they appear to reflect, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe their imagination more than their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; indulging reveries, inſtead of purſuing a train of thinking; and thus grow romantic, like the croiſaders; or like women, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly idle and reſtleſs.</p>
               <p>If we turn then with diſguſt from enſanguined regal pomp, and the childiſh raree-ſhows that amuſe the enſlaved multitude, we ſhall feel ſtill more contempt for that order of men, who cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated their faculties, only to enable them to conſolidate their power, by leading the ignorant aſtray; making the learning they concentrated in their cells, a more poliſhed inſtrument of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. Struggling with ſo many impediments, the progreſs of uſeful knowledge for ſeveral ages was ſcarcely perceptible; though reſpect for the public opinion, that great ſoftener of manners, and only ſubſtitute for moral principles, was gaining ground.</p>
               <p>The croiſades, however, gave a ſhake to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, that changed its face; and the ſpirit of chivalry, aſſuming a new character during the reign of the gallant Francis the firſt, began to meliorate the ferocity of the ancient Gauls and Franks.

for all the the ties that nature has rendered ſacred, kept thoſe men within bounds, who obeyed no other law.</p>
               <p>The ſame ſpirit mixed with the ſanguinary treachery of the Guiſes, and gave ſupport to the manly dignity of Henry the fourth, on whom nature had beſtowed that warmth of conſtitution, tenderneſs of heart, and rectitude of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which naturally produce an energetic cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter—A ſupple force, that, exciting love, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands eſteem.</p>
               <p>During the miniſtry of Richelieu, when the dynaſty of <hi>favouritiſm</hi> commenced, the arts were patronized, and the Italian mode of governing by intrigue to weaken bodies, poliſhed by the friction of continual fineſſe. Diſſimulation im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly ſlides into falſhood, and Mazarin, diſſimulation perſonified, paved the way for the impoſing pomp and falſe grandeur of the reign of the haughty and inflated Louis XIV. which, by introducing a taſte for majeſtic frivolity, acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerated the perfection of that ſpecies of civiliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which conſiſts in the refining of the ſenſes at the expence of the heart; the ſource of all real dignity, honour, virtue, and every noble quality of the mind. Endeavouring to make bigotry tolerate voluptuouſneſs, and honour and licentiouſneſs ſhake hands, ſight was loſt of the line of diſtinction, or vice was hid under the maſk of it's correlative virtue.

               <p>The feudal taſte for tournaments and martial feaſts was now naturally ſucceeded by a fondneſs for theatrical entertainments; when feats of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour became too great an exertion of the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened muſcles to afford pleaſure, and men found that reſource in cultivation of mind which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders activity of body leſs neceſſary to keep the ſtream of life from ſtagnating.</p>

their king; and the glory of the <hi>grand monarque</hi> became the national pride, even when it coſt them moſt dear.</p>
               <p>As a proof of the perverſion of mind at that period, and the falſe political opinions which prevailed, making the unhappy king the ſlave of his own deſpotiſm, it is ſufficient to ſelect one anecdote.</p>

               <p>During the regency, vice was not only bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaced, but audacious; and the tide completely turned: the hypocrites were now all ranged on the other ſide, the courtiers, labouring to ſhow their abhorrence of religious hypocriſy, ſet decency at defiance, and did violence to the modeſty of nature, when they wiſhed to outrage the ſqueamiſh puerilities of ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>In the character of the regent we may trace all the vices and graces of falſe refinement; form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the taſte by deſtroying the heart. Devoted to pleaſure, he ſo ſoon exhauſted the intoxicating cup of all its ſweets, that his life was ſpent in ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt the dregs, for the novelty that could give a gaſp of life to enjoyment. The wit, which at firſt was the zeſt of his nocturnal orgies, ſoon gave place, as flat, to the groſſeſt exceſſes, in which the principal variety was flagitious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality. And what has he done to reſcue his name from obloquy, but protect a few debauched artiſts and men of letters? His goodneſs of heart only appeared in ſympathy. He pitied the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of the people, when before his eyes; and as quickly forgot theſe yearnings of heart in his ſenſual ſtye.</p>
               <p>He often related, with great pleaſure, an anecdote of the prior de Vendome, who chanced to pleaſe a miſtreſs of Charles II, and the king could only get rid of his rival by requeſting Louis XIV. to recal him.

At thoſe moments he would beſtow the warmeſt praiſes on the Engliſh conſtitution; and ſeemed enamoured of liberty, though authoriſing at the time the moſt flagrant violations of property, and deſpotic arts of cruelty. The only good he did his country<note n="*" place="bottom">It is well known, that for a long time he wiſhed to convoke the ſtates-general; and it was not without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, that Dubois made him abandon this deſign.

His love of the fine arts, however, has led different authors to ſtrew flowers over his unhallowed duſt—fit emblem of the brilliant qualities, that ornamented only the ſoil on which they grew.</p>
               <p>The latter part of the reign of Louis XV, is notorious for the ſame atrocious debaucheries, unvarniſhed by wit, over which modeſty would fain draw a veil, were it not neceſſary to give the laſt touches to the portrait of that vile deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, under the laſh of which twenty-five millions of people groaned; till, unable to endure the increaſing weight of oppreſſion, they roſe like a vaſt elephant, terrible in his anger, tread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down with blind fury friends as well as foes.</p>

               <p>In ſuch a voluptuous atmoſphere, how could ſhe eſcape contagion? The proſligacy of Louis XIV. when love and war were his amuſements, was ſoberneſs, compared with the capricious intemperance of the inebriated imagination at this period. Madame du Barry was then in the zenith of her power, which quickly excited the jealouſy of this princeſs whoſe ſtrongeſt paſſion was that

intolerable family pride, which heated the blood of the whole houſe of Auſtria. An inclination for court intrigue, under the maſk of the moſt profound diſſimulation, to preſerve the favour of Louis XV. was inſtantly called into action; and it ſoon became the only buſineſs of life, either to gratify reſentment, or cheat the ſatiety, which the continual and unreſtrained indulgence of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure produced.</p>
               <p>Her character thus formed, when ſhe became abſolute miſtreſs, the court of the paſſive Louis, not only the moſt diſſolute and abandoned that ever diſplayed the folly of royalty, but au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciouſly negligent with reſpect to that attention to decency, which is neceſſary to delude the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, was deſerted by all perſons, who had any regard for their moral character, or the decorum of appearances. Conſtrained by the <hi>etiquette,</hi> which made the principal part of the impoſing grandeur of Louis XIV. the queen wiſhed to throw aſide the cumberſome brocade of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, without having diſcernment enough to perceive, that it was neceſſary to lend mock dignity to a court, where there was not ſufficient virtue, or native beauty, to give intereſt or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectability to ſimplicity.

               <p>The attention of the people once rouſed was not permitted to ſteep; for freſh circumſtances daily occurred, to give a new ſpring to diſcuſſions, that the moſt iniquitous and heavy taxes brought home to every boſom; till the extravagance of the royal family became the general ſubject of ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening execrations.</p>

               <p>Several abortive attempts were then made by two ſucceeding miniſters, to keep alive the public credit, and find reſources to ſupply the expendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſtate, and the diſſipation of the court, when the king was perſuaded to place the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Calonne at the head of theſe embarraſſed affairs.</p>

So far from it, with wild prodigality he ſeems to have ſquandered away the vaſt ſums he extorted by force or fraud, merely to gratify or purchaſe friends and dependents; till, quite exhauſted, he was obliged to have recourſe to Necker's ſcheme of loans. But not poſſeſſing like him the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence of the public, he could not with equal facility obtain a preſent ſupply, the weight of which would be thrown forward to become a

               <p>With an uncommon quickneſs of comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and audacity in purſuing crude ſchemes, rendered plauſible by a rhetorical flow of words, Calonne, a ſtrong repreſentative of the national character, ſeems rather to have wanted princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples than feelings of humanity; and to have been led aſtray more by vanity and the love of pleaſure, which imperceptibly ſmooth away mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reſtraints, than by thoſe deep plans of guilt, that force men to ſee the extent of the miſchief they are hatching, whilſt the crocodile is ſtill in the egg. Yet as mankind, ever judge by events, the inconſiderate preſumption, if not the turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his conduct, brought on him univerſal cenſure: for, at a criſis when the general groans of an oppreſſed nation proclaimed the diſeaſe of the ſtate, and even when the government was on the verge of diſſolution, did he not waſte the treaſures of his country, forgetful not only of moral obligations, but the ties of honour, of that regard for the tacit confidence of it's citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, which a ſtateſmen ought to hold ſacred? ſince which he has been careſſed at almoſt

every court in Europe, and made one of the principal agents of deſpotiſm in the croiſades againſt the infant liberty of France.</p>
               <p>Reflecting on the conduct of the tools of courts, we are enabled in a great meaſure to account for the ſlavery of Europe; and to diſcover, that it's miſery has not ariſen more from the imperfection of civilization, than from the fallacy of thoſe political ſyſtems, which neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily made the favourite of the day a knaviſh tyrant, eager to amaſs riches to ſave himſelf from oblivion, when the honours, ſo hardly wreſtled for, ſhould be torn from his brow. Beſides, whilſt miniſters have found impunity in the om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, which the ſeal of power gave them, and in the covert fear of thoſe who hoped one day to enjoy the ſame emoluments, they have been led by the prevalence of depraved man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to the commiſſion of every atrocious folly. Kings have been the dupes of miniſters, of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and ſecretaries, not to notice ſly valets and cunning waiting maids, who are ſeldom idle; and theſe are moſt venal, becauſe they have leaſt independency of character to ſupport; till in the circle of corruption no one can point out the firſt mover. Hence proceeds the great tenacity of courts to ſupport them; hence originates their great objection to republican forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which obliged their miniſters to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for delinquency; and hence, likewiſe, might be traced their agonizing fears of the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of civil equality.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Adminiſtration of de Brienne. Diſſolution of the Notables. Land Tax and Stamp Duty recommended by them, but refuſed to be ſanctioned by the Parliament. Bed of Juſtice. The Parliament baniſhed to Troyes,—but ſoon compromiſed for it's recall. Struggles of the Court-party to prevent the convocation of the States-General. Baniſhment of the Duke of Orleans, And two ſpirited Members of the Parliament. Court ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niere. Remarks on the Parliament. Impriſonment of the Members. Deputies of the province of Britanny ſent to the Baſtile. The Soldiery let looſe upon the People.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFTER the diſmiſſion of Calonne, M. de Brienne, a man whoſe talents Turgot had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, was now choſen by the queen, becauſe he had formerly ſeconded her views, and was ſtill the obſequious ſlave of that power, which he had long been courting, to obtain the ſo much envied place of miniſter. Having taken more pains to gain the poſt than to prepare himſelf to fulfil it's functions, his weak and timid mind was in a continual tumult; and he adopted with head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long confuſion the taxes propoſed by his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor; becauſe money muſt be had, and he knew not where to turn to procure it by an unhacknied mode of extortion.</p>
               <p>The <hi>notables</hi> were now diſſolved; and it would have been a natural conſequence of the diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:029916_0048_0FE308AAFB0AA3A8"/>
of the miniſter who aſſembled them, even if their ſpirited inquiries had not rendered their preſence vexatious to the court. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was an impolitic meaſure; for they returned highly diſguſted to their reſpective abodes, to propagate the free opinions, to which reſentment and argumentation had given birth.</p>
               <p>Before the breaking up of the <hi>notables,</hi> they were nevertheleſs prevailed upon to recommend a land and ſtamp tax; and the edicts were ſent to the parliament to be enregiſtered. But theſe magiſtrates, never forgetting that they enjoyed, in virtue of their office, the privileged exemption from taxes, to elude ſanctioning the firſt, which was to have been an equal impoſt, took advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the public odiouſneſs of the ſecond; thus avoiding, with a ſhow of patriotiſm, an avowed oppoſition to the intereſt of the people, that would clearly have proved, how much dearer they held their own.</p>
               <p>The gaudy and meretricious pageantry of the court was now diſplayed, to intimidate the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, at what was termed a bed of juſtice, though in reality of all juſtice a ſolemn mockery; and, whilſt pretending to conſult them, the edicts were enregiſtered by a mandate of ſtate. The parliament, in the mean time, making a merit of neceſſity, declared, that the right of ſanctioning the impoſt belonged only to the ſtate-general, the convocation of which they demanded. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by their ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>urdy oppoſition, the court ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed them to Troyes; and they compromiſed for their recall by enregiſtering the prolongation of the <hi>deuxieme vingtieme,</hi> a cowardly deſertion of their former ground.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:029916_0049_0FE309A27338F9E0"/>A century before (a proof of the progreſs of reaſon) the people, digeſting their diſappointment, would have ſubmitted, with brutal acquieſcence, to the majeſtic WILL of the king, without daring to ſcan it's import; but now, recognizing their own dignity, they inſiſted, that all authority, which did not originate with them, was illegal and deſpotic, and loudly ſounded the grand truth—That it was neceſſary to convoke the ſtates-general. The government, however, like a dying wretch cut off by intemperance, whilſt the luſt of enjoyment ſtill remaining prompts him to exhauſt his ſtrength by ſtruggling with death, fought ſome time longer inauſpiciouſly for exiſtence, depending on the ſuccour of the court empirics, who vainly flattered themſelves, that they could prevent it's diſſolution, From the moment, indeed, that Brienne ſucceeded Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne, all the machinery, which the demon of deſpotiſm could invent, was put into motion, to divert the current of opinion, bearing on it's fair boſom the new ſentiments of liberty with irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible force, and overwhelming, as it ſwelled, the periſhing monuments of venerable folly, and the fragile barriers of ſuperſtitious igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
               <p>But ſupplies were ſtill wanting; and the court, being fruitful in ſtratagems to procure a loan, which was the neceſſary lever of it's inſidious deſigns, coaleſced with ſome of the members of the parliament, and the agreement was to have been ratified in a <hi>séance royale.</hi> Yet, as the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had determined to be governed by a clear majority, the ſcheme of the keeper of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ais, who intended to have the buſineſs hurried
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:029916_0050_0FE308B3D4EEAC50"/>
over without telling the votes, was completely defeated.</p>
               <p>The diſcovery of this unfair attempt made the indignant magiſtrates, glad to ſeize an occaſion to recover their popularity, maintain with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs their own character, and the intereſt of the people. The duke of Orleans, alſo, ſomewhat tauntingly ſuggeſting to the king, that this was only another bed of juſtice, was exiled, with two other members, who had remonſtrated with courage. Theſe magiſtrates, now became the objects of public adoration, were conſidered by the grateful public as their only bulwark againſt the attacks of the miniſtry; which continued to haraſs invention, to contrive means to counteract a concurrence of circumſtances, that were driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them all oppoſition.</p>
               <p>The court, for I conſider the government, at this period completely at an end, continued to ſtumble out of one blunder into another, till at laſt they reſted all their hopes on the popular reforms projected by Brienne, in conjunction with Lamoignon, a man with more ſtrength of character, to cajole the people and cruſh the parliament. Several ſtrokes, the feeble blows of angry men, who wiſhed ſtill to retain the ſtolen ſweets of office, were aimed at this body, calculated to miſlead the people who, were alſo promiſed a reformed code of penal laws. But the time when partial remedies would have been eagerly ſwallowed was paſt, and the people ſaw diſtinctly, that their will would ſoon be law, and their power omnipotent. But the miniſter, Brienne, not aware of this, to ſteer clear of further oppoſition, propoſed the plan of a <hi>cour
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:029916_0051_0FE309A41181C408"/>
pléniere:</hi> an heterogeneous aſſembly of princes, nobles, magiſtrates, and ſoldiers. A happy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute, as he imagined, for the parliament; and which, by reſtoring the ancient forms of the kings of France, would awe and amuſe the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He did not conſider, that their minds were now full of other objects, and their enthuſiaſm turned into another channel.</p>
               <p>This conduct proved more deſtructive to the court than any former folly it's adviſers had committed. Imbecility now characterized every meaſure. The parliament, however, fell into the ſnare, and forfeited the eſteem and confidence of the people by oppoſing ſome popular <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly one in favour of the proteſtants, which they themſelves had demanded ten years before, and to which they now objected, only becauſe it came from another quarter. Yet the court, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of experience, endeavoured to reſtore it's credit by perſecution; whilſt, making all the claſhing movements that fear could dictate to manifeſt it's power and overawe the nation, it united all parties, and drew the whole kingdom to one point of action.</p>
               <p>The deſpotic and extravagant ſteps taken to give efficiency to the <hi>cour pléniere,</hi> awakened the ſenſibility of the moſt torpid; and the vigilance of twenty-five millions of centinels was rouſed, to watch the movements of the court, and follow it's corrupt miniſters, through all the labyrinths of ſophiſtry and tergiverſation, into the very dens of their nefarious machinations. To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the different parliaments from deliberating, and forming in conſequence a plan of conduct together, the edict to ſanction this packed cabinet
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:029916_0052_0FE308D94486EB98"/>
was to be preſented to them all on the ſame day; and a conſiderable force was aſſembled, to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midate the members, who ſhould dare to prove refractory. But, they were forewarned in time, to avoid being ſurpriſed into acquieſcence: for, having received an intimation of the deſign, a copy of the edict had been purloined from the preſs, by means of the univerſal engine of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, money.</p>
               <p>Warmed by the diſcovery of this ſurreptitious attempt to cheat them into blind obedience, they bound themſelves by an oath, to act in concert; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

Yet the ſagacious chancellor L'Hôpital, not deceived by their accidental uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, guarded the French againſt their illegal ambition; for was it not a dangerous courteſy of the people, to allow an ariſtocracy of lawyers, who bought their places, to be as it were the only repreſentatives of the nation? Still their reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance had frequently been an impediment in the way of tyranny, and now provoked a diſcuſſion,

which led to the moſt important of all queſtions —namely, in whoſe hands ought the ſovereignty to reſt?—who ought to levy the impoſt, and make laws?—and the anſwer was the univerſal demand of a fair repreſentation, to meet at ſtated periods, without depending on the caprice of the executive power. Unable to effect their purpoſe by art or force, the weak miniſtry, ſtung by the diſappointment, determined at leaſt to wreak their vengeance on two of the boldeſt of the members.

               <p>Cries of horror and indignation reſounded throughout the kingdom; and the nation, with one voice, demanded juſtice—Alas! juſtice had never been known in France. Retaliation and

vengeance had been its fatal ſubſtitutes. And from this epoch we may date the commencement of thoſe butcheries, which have brought on that devoted country ſo many dreadful calamities, by teaching the people to avenge themſelves with blood.</p>
               <p>The hopes of the nation, it is true, were ſtill turned towards the promiſed convocation of the ſtates-general; which every day became more neceſſary.

               <p>SUCH were the meaſures purſued to exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate a people beginning to open their eyes, and now clamorouſly demanding the reſtitution of their long eſtranged rights; when the court having in vain attempted to terrify or deceive them, found it expedient to ſtill the ſtorm by recalling Necker. This man had the confidence of France, which he in ſome degree merited for the light he had thrown on the ſtate of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and for the ſyſtem of economy, that he had endeavoured to adopt during his former ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration: but unfortunately he did not poſſeſs talents or political ſagacity ſufficient to pilot the ſtate in this perilous ſeaſon. Bred up in a count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe, he acquired that knowledge of detail, and attention to little advantages, ſo neceſſary when a man deſires to amaſs riches with what is termed a fair character: and, having accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated a very large fortune by unremitting induſtry;

or, to borrow the commercial phraſe, <hi>attention to the main chance,</hi> his houſe became the reſort of the men of letters of his day.</p>
               <p>The foibles of a rich man are always foſtered, ſometimes perhaps inſenſibly, by his numerous dependents and viſitants, who find his table amuſing or convenient. It is not then ſurprizing, that, with the abilities of a tolerable financier, he was ſoon perſuaded that he was a great author, and conſummate ſtateſman. Beſides, when the manners of a nation are very depraved, the men who wiſh to appear, and even to be, more moral than the multitude, in general become pedanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally virtuous; and, continually contraſting their morals with the thoughtleſs vices around them, the artificial, narrow character of a ſectary is formed; the manners are rendered ſtiff, and the heart cold. The dupes alſo of their flimſy virtue, many men are harſhly called hypocrites, who are only weak; and popularity often turns the head giddy, that would have ſoberly fulfilled the common duties of a man in the ſhade of private life.</p>
               <p>Having adopted with a timid hand many of the ſagacious plans of his model, the clear headed, unaffected Turgot, Necker was conſidered by the greater part of the nation as a conſummate politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian: neither was it ſurpriſing, that the people, ſnatched from deſpondency, ſhould have miſtaken the extent of his political knowledge, when they had eſtimated it by that of the greateſt ſtateſman, which France, or, perhaps, any other country, ever produced.</p>

vanity to believe, that he deſerved the exaggerated applauſe he received, and the reputation of wiſe, when he was only ſhrewd. Not content with the fame he acquired by writing on a ſubject, which his turn of mind and profeſſion enabled him to comprehend, he wiſhed to obtain a higher degree of celebrity, by forming into a large book various metaphyſical ſhreds of arguments, which he had collected from the converſation of men, fond of ingenious ſubtilities; and the ſtyle except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome declamatory paſſages, was as inflated and confuſed as the thoughts were far fetched and unconnected<note n="*" place="bottom">Importance of religious opinions.</note>.</p>

This was a criſis that demanded boldneſs and preciſion; and no man in France, excepting Necker, had the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of poſſeſſing extenſive political talents; becauſe the old ſyſtem of government ſcarcely afforded a field, in which the abilities of men could be unfolded, and their judgment matured by experience.

               <p>Thus far he ſeems to have acted with ſome degree of prudence, at leaſt; but, inattentive to the robuſt ſtrength which the public opinion had then acquired, he wavered as to the mode of conſtituting the ſtates-general, whilſt the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament paſſed a decree to prevent their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling in any other manner than they did in 1614. This obſtinate pretention to legiſlate for the nation was no longer to be tolerated, when they

               <p>At this critical moment, the miniſter, enjoying great popularity, had it in his power, could he have governed the court, to have ſuggeſted a ſyſtem, which might ultimately have prove<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The <hi>notables</hi> had now two eſſential points to ſettle; namely, to regulate the election of the deputies, and how they were afterwards to vote. The population and wealth of ſeveral provinces, from commercial advantages and other cauſes, had given a new face to the country ſince the former election; ſo much ſo, that, if the ancient diviſion were adhered to, the repreſentation could not fail to be very unequal. Yet if the natural order of population were followed, the grand queſtion of voting by orders or by voices ſeemed to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged by the great increaſe of the members of the <hi>tiers-etat.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The nobles and the clergy immediately rallied round the ſtandard of privileges, inſiſting, that France would be ruined, if their <hi>rights</hi> were touched: and ſo true were they now to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulated intereſt, that all the committees into which the <hi>notables</hi> were divided, excepting that of which <hi>monſieur</hi> was preſident, determined againſt allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>tiers-etat</hi> that increaſe of power neceſſary to enable them to be uſeful.

Dauphine ſet the example; and the three orders uniting ſketched a plan for the organization of the whole kingdom, which ſerved as a model for the other provincial ſtates, and furniſhed grounds for the conſtituent aſſembly to work on when forming the conſtitution.

Thoſe of the Abbé Sieyes and the marquis de Condorcet were the moſt philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical; whilſt the unctuous eloquence of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau ſoftened theſe dry reſearches, and fed the flame of patriotiſm.</p>
               <p>In this poſture of affairs, Necker, perceiving that the people were grown reſolute, prevailed

on the council to decree, that the number of the deputies of the <hi>tiers-etat</hi> ſhould be equal to that of the two other orders taken together: but whether they were to vote by chambers, or in the ſame body, was ſtill left undetermined.</p>
               <p>The people whoſe patience had been worn out by injuries and inſults, now only thought of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring inſtructions for their repreſentatives.— But, inſtead of looking for gradual improvement, letting one reform calmly produce another, they ſeemed determined to ſtrike at the root of all their miſery at once: the united miſchiefs of a monarchy unreſtrained, a prieſthood unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily numerous, and an overgrown nobility: and theſe haſty meaſures, become a ſubject worthy of philoſophical inveſtigation, naturally fall into two diſtinct ſubjects of inquiry.</p>

               <p>But, 2dly, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that, if the degeneracy of the higher orders of ſociety be ſuch, that no remedy leſs fraught with horror can effect a radical cure; and if enjoying the fruits of uſurpation, they domineer over the wea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, further, if it can be aſcertained, that the ſilent ſufferings of the citizens of the world under the iron feet of oppreſſion are greater, though leſs obvious, than the calamities produced by ſuch violent convulſions as have happened in France; which, like hurricanes whirling over the face of nature, ſtrip off all its blooming graces; it may be politically juſt, to purſue ſuch meaſures as were taken by that regenerating country, and at once root out thoſe deleterious plants, which poiſon the better half of human happineſs.

The rich have for ages tyrannized over the poor, teaching them how to act when poſſeſſed of power, and now muſt feel the conſequence. People are rendered ferocious by miſery; and miſanthropy is ever the offspring of diſcontent. Let not then the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of one half of mankind be built on the miſery of the other, and humanity will take place of charity, and all the oſtentatious virtues of an univerſal ariſtocracy. How, in fact, can we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to ſee men live together like brothers, when we only ſee maſter and ſervant in ſociety? For till men learn mutually to aſſiſt without govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other, little can be done by political aſſociations towards perfecting the condition of mankind.</p>
               <p>Europe will probably be, for ſome years to come, in a ſtate of anarchy; till a change of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, gradually undermining the ſtrong-holds of cuſtom, alters the manners, without rouſing the little paſſions of men, a pack of yelping curs pampered by vanity and pride.

               <p>Several acts of ferocious folly have juſtly brought much obloquy on the grand revolution, which has taken place in France; yet, I feel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of being able to prove, that the people are eſſentially good, and that knowledge is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly

               <p>From implicitly obeying their ſovereigns, the French became ſuddenly all ſovereigns; yet, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is natural for men to run out of one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme into another, we ſhould guard againſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring, that the ſpirit of the moment will not evaporate, and leave the diſturbed water more clear for the fermentation.

               <p>BEFORE we enter on the grand buſineſs produced by the meeting of the ſtates-general, it is neceſſary to take a retroſpective glance over the oppreſſions of which Frenchmen ſo loudly complained; and, whilſt we trace their juſtneſs, the queſtion will only be, why they did not ſooner raiſe their ſhoulders to heave off the

To aſcertain this truth, we need not enter into deep reſearches, though it may be difficult to collect all the parts of the feudal chain, which linked the deſpotiſm of ſixty thouſand nobles, who not only exerciſed all the tyranny that the ſyſtem authoriſed, but countenanced the ſtill more extenſive depredations of their nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous dependents.

               <p>It would be captious, perhaps, to dwell on ſome of the abominable tenures of perſonal ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, which, though grown obſolete, were not abrogated; eſpecially as more ſpecious, if not leſs grinding, not leſs debaſing exactions were in force, to deprave every moral feeling of the two diviſions of ſociety; the governing, and governed.</p>

Activity then being continually damped by ſuch various reſtrictions, inſtead of being braced by encouragement, an invincible impediment was thrown in the way of agricultural improvements; for each individual, inſulated by oppreſſion, lived, ſtrictly ſpeaking, from hand to mouth; not caring to ſtore up comforts, at the expence of extraordinary toil, when the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment

depended on ſo many caſualties. Yet, never beginning to be ſenſible of the effect, the people were not, probably, aware of the cauſe; and only exclaimed againſt new impoſitions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not think ſufficiently deep to detect the old.</p>
               <p>Beſide which, France maintained two hundred thouſand prieſts, united in the ſame ſpirit of licentiouſneſs; who indulged themſelves in all the depraved pleaſures of cloaked immorality, at the ſame time they embruted the people by ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the moſt diabolical prejudices; to whoſe empire every conſideration of juſtice and political improvement was ſacrificed.</p>
               <p>Added to evils of this magnitude, there were the canker-worms that lurked behind monaſtic walls. For ſixty thouſand perſons, who by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing the world cut the thread of nature, ſerved as a prop to the prieſthood that enjoyed more than a fourth of the produce of all France; independent of the eſtates it poſſeſſed, which were immenſe. And this body of men, the leeches of the kingdom, the idols of the ignorant, and the palladium of tyranny, contributed not a farthing to the ſupport of the hydra, whom they were anxious to protect, as a guard to themſelves. Oſtentatiouſly boaſting of their charity, whilſt revelling on the ſpoil of fraud, by a ſacrilege the moſt neſarious, their whole lives were a mockery of the doctrines, which they taught, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to reverence. Beſide theſe, and other vexations, almoſt innumerable, one entangled in another; each petty monopoly contributed to ſtrengthen the maſſy fabric of deſpotiſm, which reared it's head in defiance of time and reaſon.

Much, indeed, depended on the caprice of the individuals of the privileged orders, whom the court could actuate at will, giving them occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally a ſop to ſilence any peeviſh growl.</p>
               <p>There were alſo the farmers-general, with their army of fifty thouſand collectors, who, by their manner of levying and amaſſing the revenue, gave an additional gripe to an oppreſſion, the moſt wringing that could be invented, becauſe it's very principles led to the exerciſe of the vileſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; and impunity was ſecured by a coalition of robbers, that multitude of men in office, whoſe families and flatterers all lived, and fattened on the ſpoil of their continual war with juſtice. And, whilſt the intereſt of the people was continually ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed by the parliaments, the inferior courts of law were ſtill more venal, becauſe compoſed of thoſe litigious practitioners, who thicken like ſpawn on putrid bodies, when a ſtate is become corrupt.</p>

Who is ſo much under the influence of prejudice, as to inſiſt, that French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are a diſtinct race, formed by nature, or by habit, to be ſlaves; and incapable of ever attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe noble ſentiments, which characterize a free people? When the dawn of them appeared conſpicuouſly at the elections for the ſtates-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, which were the preparatory ſtruggles to make a change of opinion produce an eſſential alteration in government.</p>
               <p>Six millions of men were now in motion to chooſe the deputies, and prepare their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and in theſe aſſemblies the commons commenced their political career; diſcuſſing, on new ground, ſubjects that quickly became the only intereſting topics throughout the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
               <p>In ſome few places, the three orders meeting together ſeemed to decide the important queſtion reſpecting the equality of the repreſentatives; but, in general, the firſt two chambered themſelves to guard tenaciouſly their trembling prerogatives; and the third, with a cautious jealouſy, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the redreſs of grievances, which they could ſcarcely expect the others to denominate by ſo harſh a name.</p>
               <p>Great decorum reigned in the chamber of the nobility, though ſplit into various ranks; the lower of which had ill brooked, for a long time,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:029916_0072_0FE309BF26CE9200"/>
the overbearing inſolence of thoſe princes and peers, who haughtily conteſted every ſtep of honour. Still all agreed, to reſign their pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary privileges, and joined in vague terms, with the public voice, to demand a conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The ſame diviſions produced more viſible effects amongſt the clergy: for conſiderable tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults were the conſequence of the ſtruggle of the pariſh prieſts, the commons of this order, to have th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In fact, every dioceſs was become the centre of a petty deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm, more galling than the great, becauſe at each man's elbow; and the pariſh-prieſts, who were not in the high road to preferment, being moſt oppreſſed, led the van in the new conteſt for equality; whilſt diſreſpect for the m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tre paved the way to a contempt for the crown.</p>
               <p>Indiviſible as had hitherto been the clerical body, the indecent pride of the dignitaries of the church, at this juncture, produced the ſchiſm, which induced the majority of the clergy to ſide with the people; whilſt only a ſmall minority of the nobility deſerted the common cauſe of the party. The pariſh-prieſts, in fact, appeared, from the time of their election, a corps in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve for the third-eſtate; where they ſought for the conſequence they were denied in their own chamber, finding themſelves more nearly allied by intereſt, as well as inclination, to this order than to the rich paſtors, who, ſeparating the ſheep from the goats, bade them ſtand aloof, as poſſeſſing leſs riches—the holineſs of that body, as of all others. The electing of ſo many of the
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:029916_0073_0FE309831B007DA8"/>
inferior clergy, in ſpite of the menaces and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of their numerous ſuperiors, was a ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proof, that the power of the church was in the wane; and that the people were beginning to feel their own ſtrength. The diſturbances at this time ſeemed the rumbling of the approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tempeſt; and orators, formed in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial aſſemblies, to figure afterwards in national, were encouraged by applauſe to perſevere.</p>
               <p>Having the ſame mark in view, an uniformity of ſentiment breathed throughout the inſtructions of the third-eſtate; principally levelled at the privileges of the two other orders: for on theſe abuſes the moſt popular publications had hinged, rivetting conviction in the minds of the ſuffering people. A celebrated pamphlet, written by the abbé Sieyes, went through ſixty editions; and the duke of Orleans, piqued at the royal family, took great pains to ſpread abroad opinions, which were far from being congenial with his own; thus, with purblind ambition, labouring to overturn a court, the ruins of which have rebounded on his own head.</p>
               <p>But the temper of the nation, ſore with ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and warmed by theſe diſcuſſions, ſo ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

in the moment of action, to fly from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme to the other, without conſidering, that the ſtrongeſt conviction of reaſon cannot quickly change a habit of body; much leſs the manners that have been gradually produced by certain modes of thinking and acting.</p>
               <p>With one voice, however, the whole nation called for a conſtitution, to eſtabliſh equal rights, as the foundation of freedom; and to guard againſt the depredations of favourites, whether they attacked perſon or property. So that the liberty of the preſs, and the abolition of <hi>lettres de cachet,</hi> were, in general, the articles that followed the poſitive injunction of confining the right of taxation to the repreſentative body of the nation. The inſtitution of juries was recommended, and the deputies were requeſted to take into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, whether the number of capital puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments could not be leſſened, or totally aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; remarks were made on the evil tendency of lotteries, and on the vexatious impediments thrown in the way of trade, by barriers and mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polies. In ſhort, againſt the tyranny and injuſtice of the court, the nobility, and the clergy, all remonſtrated; unmaſking one ſpecies of oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and dil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To divert the gathering ſtorm from breaking over their heads, the cabal determined to reſt all their hopes on the aid of the foreign troops; which they were collecting from different parts of the kingdom, not ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

who were aſſuming the character of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. Mean while, with the uſual chicanery of courtiers, they continued to amuſe the deputies, till they could cruſh them at once; and effectually blaſt the hopes of the people. The human heart is naturally good, though ſo often the dupe of paſſion.—For though it's feelings be ſophiſticated, or ſtiſted; though the head contrives the blackeſt machinations; even in the ſilence of ſolitude, who will whiſper to himſelf that he is a villain? Will he not rather try, like Milton's devil, to find out a damned plea of neceſſity, to cover his guilt?— paying homage, in ſpite of himſelf, to the eternal juſtice he violates under the pretext of ſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. But, it is not alone the virtues of man, thoſe changing hues, of which the colour is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decided, that proclaim his native dignity. No; his vices have the ſame ſtamp of the divinity; and it is neceſſary to pervert the underſtanding, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the heart can be led aſtray. Men, likewiſe, indolently adopt the habits of thinking of their day, without weighing them. Thus theſe very courtiers, who could coolly contemplate the maſſacre, which muſt be the conſequence of aſſembling the foreign troops, becauſe it was a continuance of the eſtabliſhed courſe of things, have ſince ſtarted, probably with real horror, from the contemplation of the butcheries, which their very tenacity produced. Such is the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the human heart, and ſo neceſſary is it to render the head clear to make the principles of action pure.</p>
               <p>The deputies, however, who were moſtly collected from remote parts of the country, had become in their villages the hale ſons of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:029916_0076_0FE309C9C1797100"/>
And, though the French mania, of adoring their monarch, extended to every part of the kingdom, it only gave hilarity to the cheering glaſs at the homely tables of which they were maſters; or activity to the dance, that was a real burſt of animal ſpirits. Very different from the laſcivious provocations to vice, exhibited at the opera, which, by deſtroying the ſocial affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that attach men to each other, ſtifle all public ſpirit; for what is patriotiſm but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſion of domeſtic ſympathy, rendered perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent by principle? Beſides, the writings that had awakened the ſpirit of theſe men had a little inebriated their brain. Such is, for the moſt part, the baneful effect of eloquence, that, perſuading inſtead of convincing, the glory of the enthuſiaſm it inſpires is ſullied by that falſe magnanimity, which vanity and ignorance continually miſtake for real elevation of ſoul; though, like the ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rays of the ſun after rain, it dries into ſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the heart, whoſe emotions are too quickly exhaled.</p>
               <p>The courtiers, deſpiſing their ruſticity, and ſtill conſidering the people as cyphers, continued to diſcharge the uſual routine of office, by adjuſting the ceremonials of reception; all which tended to inſult the third-eſtate, and ſhow, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the privileged orders were to be ſtill treated as if they were a diſtinct claſs of beings. The inſolence of ſuch proceedings could not fail to provoke the honeſt indignation, and pique the vanity of thoſe, who had been diſcuſſing on a broad ſcale the rights of man: whilſt a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted by the ceremony that conſtrained them, they were obliged, every moment, to recollect,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:029916_0077_0FE3098626245FB0"/>
that they were the equals of theſe courtiers; and bluſhed even to own to themſelves, that they could for an inſtant have been awed by ſuch childiſh pomp. Nor were they more aſtoniſhed at the pageantry of Verſailles, than diſguſted with the haughtineſs of a court, whoſe magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence was a proof how much they had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed the people, who now demanded eman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipation. Full, therefore, of the new notions of independence, which made them ſpurn at every idea of a diſtinction of men, they took advantage of the majority accorded them by council, and began to rally their forces. Perceiving alſo, as they acted decidedly, that they poſſeſſed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the people, who, forgetting <hi>vive le roi,</hi> exclaimed only vive le tiers etat!— they every day became more firm.</p>
               <p>The courtiers immediately fixed on a houſe of rendezvous, where they were regularly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert the beſt meaſures to cruſh the riſing power of the commons; and theſe, not without a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the miſtruſt, which characterizes the nation, aſſembled in different places, till a mutual intereſt united them in that choſen by the deputies from Brittany. The diſreſpect, likewiſe, which the orders relative to their dreſs anounced, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them for the contempt they were deſtined to receive, when ſeparated like the Indian caſts, amongſt whom a man fears to be polluted by the touch of an inferior: for true to the inveterate prejudice in favour of precedents<note n="*" place="bottom">'The code of étiquette', ſays Mirabeau, <q>has been hitherto the ſacred fire of the court and privileged orders.</q>
                  </note>, the nobility were gaudily capariſoned for the ſhow, whilſt

the commons were ſtupidly commanded to wear the black mantle, that diſtinguiſhes the lawyers. But, the tide of opinion once turned, every thing contributes to accelerate it's courſe.</p>
               <p>Before the meeting of the ſtates-general, the queſtion that was firſt to agitate the various in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, whether they were to vote by orders or poll, had been ſo thoroughly diſcuſſed, that it made, in many of the inſtructions, one of the foremoſt articles. For it was evident to the nation, were the different orders allowed to aſſemble in their ſeparate chambers, each inveſted with the old privilege of putting a negative on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of the other two, that they ſhould be gul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with promiſes of reform, whilſt the coffers of the court were repleniſhed with a ſhow of legality. It was, in fact, prudent in the court party to maintain this ground, becauſe it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be the only way to render abortive all the plans of reformation that ſtruck at their authority. This then was the prefatory buſineſs, by which they were to meaſure their ſtrength; and, would to God! the vigour manifeſted on this occaſion had always been diſplayed by the repreſentatives of thoſe miſled people.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen the plots of this weak, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong cabinet every where defeated, and traced their bloody footſteps; but we ſhall find them ſtill true to their ſcent, having recourſe again to violence, when fraud was of no avail.</p>
               <p>To furniſh a pretext to introduce adroitly a conſiderable military force, at the time of the aſſembling of the ſtates-general, two or three riots had been exhibited at Paris, in which many of the thoughtleſs populace were killed. One in
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:029916_0079_0FE3098F39951AA8"/>
particular, though ſtill involved in the ſhades of myſtery, occaſioned great confuſion and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſlaughter, juſt at the eve of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>A reſpectable manufacturer in the ſuburbs of Paris, with the faireſt character, employed a number of poor, whom he paid liberally; yet againſt this man ſome idle ſtories were induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly circulated, well contrived to miſlead and exaſperate the people, becauſe they touched their vanity, and their moſt preſſing want, the want of bread. The ſcarcity, real or factitious, of this article, has always been taken advantage of by thoſe who wiſhed to excite tumults in Paris; and at this juncture the duped Pariſians roſe, at the inſtigation of the court agents, to deſtroy themſelves. The riot was permitted to get a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head before any ſerious attempts to quell it were taken, which rendered the interference of a little army, the point aimed at, neceſſary; and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed an opinion, that the turbulent mob re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be awed by the preſence of troops, whilſt the ſtates-general deliberated.</p>
               <p>During this efferveſcence, or, at leaſt, when it was ſubſiding, the ſtates-general was opened, on the 5th of May, 1789, by a ſpeech from the throne, to which courtiers, in the uſual phraſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ology, would naturally tack the epithet—<hi>gracious.</hi> The king commenced with a heartleſs declaration of his ſatisfaction at ſeeing himſelf ſurrounded by the repreſentatives of the people; and then enumerating the heavy debts of the nation, a great part of which had been accumulated during his reign, he added one of thoſe idle falſehoods, which ſwelled his declamation without throwing
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:029916_0080_0FE309CB4AD66230"/>
duſt into any one's eyes, <hi>that it was in an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able cauſe;</hi> when it was notorious, that the cauſe ought to have been reckoned moſt diſhonourable, if power had not hitherto been the true philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's ſtone, that tranſmuted the baſeſt actions into ſterling honour. He afterwards alluded to the ſpirit of innovation, that had taken poſſeſſion of the minds of the people, and the general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content that agitated the nation: but, in the true cant of courts, dictating whilſt complimenting, he aſſured them, that he depended on their wiſdom and moderation; concluding with the words of courſe, <hi>the humhle ſervant of kings,</hi> a declaration of his attachment to the public wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
               <p>The diſregarded ſpeech of the keeper of the ſeals was, like the reply uſually made to the king's, in the houſe of commons in England, merely an echo of his majeſty's, recommending moderation in the meaſures adopted to reform the abuſes of government, with the neceſſary quantum of panegyric on the goodneſs of the king.</p>
               <p>Attention and applauſe, however, awaited Necker, though followed by wearineſs and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. He ſpoke for three hours, introducing, with his cuſtomary pomp of words, a number of trivial obſervations; trying thus to eſcape, in a miſt of rhetorical flouriſhes, from the ſubject he feared to bring forward, becauſe he was equally apprehenſive of offending the court, and deſirous of maintaining his reputation with the people. Not a word was uttered relative to the ſole right of the ſtates-general to levy taxes, the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the nation. And men who for ſome

time had been talking of nothing but liberty and reform, were aſtoniſhed, and diſſatisfied, that he avoided all mention of a new conſtitution. Lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſide of the privileged orders, he aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the mode of deliberating and voting in ſeparate aſſemblies was the pillar of the nation —yet, cautiouſly adding a ſalvo, to have a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to uſe another language ſhould it be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, he remarked, that <hi>ſometimes</hi> it was better to poll. This ill-timed management naturally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed both parties, as is always the caſe, when men of weak, compound characters, who have not the courage to act right, want effrontery to brave the cenſure, that would follow an open avowal of their undecided opinions; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, their determination to keep well with the ſtrongeſt. Dwelling on the arrangement of the finances, he aſſured them, that a public bank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptcy might eaſily be avoided; and that even the <hi>deficit,</hi> which had been exaggerated by France, and Europe, was only fifty-ſix millions; and would appear of leſs conſequence, when they recollected, that ſince <hi>his</hi> adminiſtration, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue was augmented twenty-five millions. It is true, that, on entering into details, the greater part of this ſum was found to be ſtill in perſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and at the ſame time was to be raiſed by taxes, which all good citizens hoped would ſoon diſappear. In ſhort, the French, after applaud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with rapture this brilliant bird's-eye view, obſerved, with the ſhrug of <hi>ſang freid,</hi>
                  <q>that theſe hypothetical reſources were merely faith and hope, on condition that they ſhould be charitable.</q>
With reſpect to the aboliſhing of privileges, that warred with humanity, he made

uſe of ſome of the ſame ſpecies of jeſuitical argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which are employed by the oppoſers of the abolition of the infamous traffic for ſlaves; that, as theſe privileges were a kind of property, it was neceſſary to find out a compenſation, an indemnity, before they could be done away— with juſtice.</p>
               <p>Thus has the ſpirit of juſtice—it is difficult to keep down indignation when attacking ſuch ſophiſms—been always outraged by the mock reſpect of ſelfiſhneſs; for, without parrying off tergiverſation, it is ſufficient to prove, that certain laws are not juſt, becauſe no government had a right to make them; and, though they may have received what is termed a legal ſanction during the times of ignorance, "the duty lies in the breach and not in the obſervance." Beſides, theſe pitiful arguments are an inſult to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe, and to the diſtreſs of a people.— Where, indeed, could the French, or Engliſh, find a fund to indemnify the privileged orders or the planters? The abuſes then, muſt continue to the end of time—out of ſheer reſpect to the ſacredneſs of public faith!</p>
               <p>Thus ſpoke the king and Necker; but theſe addreſſes, inſtead of conciliating, only rendered both parties more obſtinate; ſo that the ſmother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpute reſpect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the next day, even the deputies of the third-eſtate repaired to the common hall, and agreed, that the three orders ſhould proceed to verify their powers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; clearly perceiving, that, were the orders once allowed to do buſineſs ſeparately, an union

would be impracticable, and all their efforts to obtain a conſtitution null, ſhould they attempt to make equality of rights the baſis. The nobility and clergy not joining the commons, they reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to renew their meeting the following morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; only as an aggregate of individuals, who had no power to act, not having yet a political character. This very conteſt ſeemed to call upon them to ſupport their claim to equality, becauſe it emphatically warned them, that all their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations would be rendered perfectly nugatory, ſhould they permit the orders to be a check on each other. The moſt ſenſible men of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons being of opinion, that all expectations of a permanent reform were chimerical, unleſs the whole repreſentation was formed into an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible aſſembly, encouraged the more undecided to perſevere; though the nobles ſignified to them, on the 13th, that they had aſcertained the legality of their election.</p>
               <p>The clergy, however, divided in their intereſt, proceeded with more caution; and the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of them, perceiving that their order was becoming obnoxious to the people, who now deified the third eſtate, propoſed a committee of conciliation, with a view, as they pretended, to promote a good underſtanding between all parties. The king alſo, in his turn, when the nobles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the mediation of the clergy, offered a plan of accommodation; a mighty nothing, that the court brought forth.—But this tub, thrown out to the whale, did not divert the attention of either party from the main object; though the nobles, many of whom were in the ſecret of the approach of the army, ſhould things be carried

to extremes, pretended to acquieſce; yet guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing carefully at the ſame time all their ancient pretenſions: and this inſincerity drew on them the univerſal odium they merited, mixed with the contempt which ineffectual ſtruggles always produce. Conciliatory meaſures, in fact, were only a ſolemn farce at this time; though the clergy, rather inſidiouſly, to ingratiate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the people, lamenting the high price of bread, requeſted, that deputies from the three orders ſhould meet to deliberate how this griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance might be leſſened. The deputies of the commons, with becoming dignity, tempered with prudence, adhered to their point; and dexter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly parrying off the artful ſtroke levelled at their popularity, they repreſented to the clergy, that this was another powerful motive, to make them entreat all parties to rally round the ſame point, to remedy evils which excited equal ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy in their boſoms.</p>
               <p>The inactivity occaſioned by theſe diſputes could not fail to inflame the public mind, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as freſh publications were daily affording it fuel. For the liberty of the preſs was now tacitly eſtabliſhed, and the freeſt ſentiments utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the heat of ſuperficial knowledge, in defiance of court manifeſtoes. Still, as a proof that the court merely endured, for a ſeaſon, what they could not prevent, the journal of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the ſtates-general was ſtopped, by an expreſs order; to evade which it was continued in the form of letters from Mirabeau to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents.</p>
               <p>This prohibition was probably dictated by a deſire of keeping the provinces quiet in the ſtupor

In reality, the eyes of all France were at preſent directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the commons. The hopes of the nation reſted on their magnanimity; and the future happineſs of millions depended upon their perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. It was in this ſtate of things, that they afforded a convincing proof to the whole world, and to poſterity, that vigour and preciſion <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, previouſly, they ſent a deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the other orders, for the laſt time, to invite them once more to repair to the common-hall, that their powers might be verified toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; adding, that in default of their appearance, they ſhould conſtiture themſelves, and act ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.

               <p>The nobles, whoſe inveterate pride and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance had prevented them from joining the th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="75" facs="unknown:029916_0086_0FE309D4C8DC0930"/>
like the muſty rolls of their pedigree, were mouldering into common duſt. The clergy, however, more adroit, or rather a few of the the parochial prieſts, by degrees, attended the ſummons, and repaired to the hall. There can be little doubt, but that the commons, at the firſt meeting, and for a long time after, would gladly have coaleſced with the nobles; by which means the latter would have retained many of their privileges, and preſerved a weight in the nation, neceſſary to hinder that preponderance, on the ſide of the people, which it was eaſy to foreſee would be productive of many exceſſes. This concluſion continual experience warranted; becauſe it generally happens, that men, who are not directed by practical knowledge, in whatever buſineſs they engage, run precipitately from one extreme to the other. And certainly, from the ſtate of ſervility in which the French nation was ſunk, retaliation was to be expected; or, at leaſt, dreaded, from unbridled liberty. Like boys diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed from ſchool, they might wiſh to aſcertain their freedom by acts of miſchief; and by ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a total diſregard of the arbitrary commands, that kept down their ſpirits without exerciſing their underſtandings. However, the ſtupid ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance of the nobles ſtript them, before the time reaſon would have determined, of thoſe idle diſtinctions of opinion, the ſymbols of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm, which were not completely worn out of eſteem.</p>
               <p>The miniſter, ſtill afraid to act independent of the court, blamed this ſpirited conduct of the commons, as an act of temerity, which t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

though fearing that the court, like a dying ſavage, mortally wounded by his enemy, might, during the agonies of death, aim a deſperate ſtroke at them, took the moſt prudent precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to avoid exaſperating the fal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Enthuſiaſm fired every heart, and extended itſelf like thought from one end of the kingdom to the other. The very novelty of this meaſure was ſufficient to animate a people leſs volatile than the French; and, perhaps, it is impoſſible to form a juſt conception of the tranſports which this deciſion excited in every corner of the empire. Europe alſo heard with aſtoniſhment what reſounding through France excited the moſt lively emotions; and poſterity muſt read with wonder the recital of the follies and atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities committed by the court and nobles at that important criſis.</p>
               <p>The Social Contract of Rouſſeau, and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable work on the origin of the inequalities amongſt mankind, had been in the hands of all France, and admired by many, who could not enter into the depth of the reaſoning. In ſhort, they were learned by heart, by thoſe whoſe heads could not comprehend the chain of argument, though they were ſufficiently clear to ſeize the prominent ideas, and act up to their conviction. Perhaps, the great advantage of eloquence is, that, impreſſing the reſults of thinking on minds alive only to emotion, it gives wings to the ſlow
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:029916_0088_0FE309D7758589C0"/>
foot of reaſon, and fire to the cold labours of inveſtigation: yet it is obſervable, that, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as the underſtanding is cultivated, the mind grows attached to the exerciſe of inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the combination of abſtract ideas. The nobles of France had alſo read theſe writings for amuſement; but they left not on their minds traces of conviction ſufficiently ſtrong to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thoſe prejudices ſelf-intereſt rendered ſo dear, that they eaſily perſuaded themſelves of their reaſonableneſs. The nobility and clergy, with all their dependents under the influence of the ſame ſentiments, formed a conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of the nation, on the reſt of which they looked down with contempt, conſidering them as merely the graſs of the land, neceſſary to clothe nature; yet only fit to be trodden under foot. But theſe deſpiſed people were beginning to feel their real conſequence, and repeated with emphaſis the happy compariſon of the Abbé Siéyes,
<q>that the nobility are like vegetable tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which cannot exiſt without the ſap of the plants they exhauſt.</q>
Nevertheleſs, in treating with the nobles, the angles of pride, which time alone could have ſmoothed ſilently away, were, perhaps, too rudely knocked off, for the folly of diſtinctions was rapidly wearing itſelf out, and would probably have melted gradually before the rational opinions that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually gaining ground, fructifying the ſoil as they diſſolved; inſtead of which it was drifted by a hurricane, to ſpread deſtruction around as it fell.</p>
               <p>Many of the officers, who had ſerved in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica during the late war, had beheld the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants

of a whole empire living in a ſtate of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect equality; and returned, charmed with their ſimplicity and integrity, the concomitants of a juſt government, erected on the ſolid foundation of equal liberty, to ſcan the rectitude or policy of a different ſyſtem.

                  </gap> of their inutility as nobles, theſe, when fired with the love of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſeconded the views of the commons with heart and voice. But the ſycophants of the court, and the greater part of the nobility, who were groſsly ignorant of every thing that was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in the art of living in a continual round of pleaſure, inſenſible of the precipice on which they were ſtanding, would not, at firſt, recede a ſingle ſtep to ſave themſelves; and this obſtinacy was the chief cauſe that led to the entire new organization of the conſtitution, framed by the national aſſembly. The French in reality were arrived, through the vices of their government, at that degree of falſe refinement, which makes every man, in his own eyes, the centre of the world; and when this groſs ſelfiſhneſs, this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete depravity, prevails in a nation, an abſolute change muſt take place; becauſe the members of it have loſt the cement of humanity, which kept them together. All other vices are, properly ſpeaking, ſuperfluous ſtrength, powers running to waſte; but this morbid ſpot ſhows, that there is death in the heart. Whatever, indeed, may be the wiſdom or folly of a mixed government of king, lords, and commons, is of no conſequence in the preſent hiſtory; becauſe it appears ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of prejudices, could diſcern neither the true dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of man, nor the ſpirit of the times.</p>
               <p>It alſo deſerves to be noted, that the regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the French government, at this criſis, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the fortitude of the national aſſembly at the outſet of the conteſt; for, if the court party had prevailed, the commons would have reſted in their uſual ſtate of inſignificancy, and their whole proceedings proved only a ſolemn farce. They would have wrapped themſelves up in their black mantles, like the herd of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers' men at a funeral, merely to follow with ſervile ſteps the idle cavalcade to it's reſting place; and the people would only have ſeen their ancient tyranny revive, tricked out in new habiliments.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>THE third-eſtate, having conſtituted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a national aſſembly, now proceeded to buſineſs, with calm prudence, taking into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration the urgent neceſſities of the ſtate. Cloſely alſo attending to their inſtructions, they firſt pronounced, that all taxes not enacted by the conſent of the repreſentatives of the people
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:029916_0092_0FE309D8FACBAE78"/>
were illegal; and afterwards gave a temporary ſanction to the preſent levies, to avoid diſſolving one government before they had framed another. They then turned their attention to the object next in importance, and declared, that, as ſoon as, in concert with his majeſty, they ſhould be able to fix the principles of national regeneration, they would employ themſelves to examine and liquidate the national debt; mean time the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors of the ſtate were declared to be under the ſafe-guard of the honour of the French nation. Theſe decrees concluded with a reſolve, that the aſſembly, now become active, ſhould dedicate it's firſt moments to enquire into the cauſe of the ſcarcity that afflicted the kingdom; and to ſearch for a remedy the moſt prompt and effectual.</p>
               <p>The nobles, biſhops, and, in fact, the whole court, now ſeriouſly began to rally all their forces; convinced that it was become neceſſary, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their united ſtrength againſt the commons, to prevent their carrying every thing before them.</p>
               <p>The chamber of the clergy had been engaged for ſeveral days, in diſcuſſing the queſtion, where they ſhould verify their powers. A number of them, during this diſcuſſion, appear to have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, feeling their way; for when they now came to divide, the majority decided to join the national aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Alarmed by the proſpect of this junction, one of the members of the chamber, which almoſt arrogated to itſelf the prerogative of legiſlation, that of the nobles, propoſed an addreſs to the king, beſeeching him to diſſove the ſtates-general;
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:029916_0093_0FE308A8A1550520"/>
whilſt the cauſe of the people was there vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſupported by a minority, feeble as to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, but powerful in argument, animated by the popularity, which their bold declaration could not fail to produce during the reign of enthuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>This was a moment pregnant with great events. The court ſtill truſted to ſubterfuge, and, hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the repreſentatives of the people in ſuperlative contempt, affected in ſome degree to yield to the prayer of the nation; though ſignifying, that the king was the only fountain of juſtice, and that he would grant any thing which his faithful ſubjects could reaſonably demand. A trick as palpable as the deſign was flagrant; for at the inſtant they were pretending to ſee ſome reaſon in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, they were guarding againſt their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the only thing that could ſecure their rights, an equal repreſentation; holding for this purpoſe miſchievous councils, compoſed of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters moſt obnoxious in the eyes of the people. In theſe meetings it was reſolved, to amuſe the commons, until the army could be aſſembled; and then, in caſe of obſtinacy, they would draw on themſelves the conſequence. Accordingly the 20th of June, the day on which the majority of the clergy was to join the commons, the herald proclaimed a <hi>ſéance royale</hi>; and a detachment of guards ſurrounded the hall of the national aſſembly, to take care (ſuch was the ſhallow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text) that it ſhould be properly prepared for the reception of the king. The deputies came to the door at the uſual hour; but only the preſident (Baillie) and the ſecretaries were permitted to enter to take away their papers: and they ſaw,
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:029916_0094_0FE308CC5B136968"/>
that the benches were already removed, and that all the entrances were guarded by a great number of ſoldiers.</p>

During the firſt tumult of ſurpriſe, it is true, ſome of the deputies talked of going immediately to Marly, to invite the king to come among them, and in a truly paternal manner to unite his power with their's to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the public good; and thus by an energetic appeal to his heart and underſtanding, to convince him that they ſpoke the language of truth and reaſon. But others, more experienced in miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial wiles, calmly adviſed to adjourn the ſittings to the neighbouring Tennis-court. For they knew, that the hearts of courtiers are fortified with icy prejudices; and that, though a moment of ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy, a flow of life-blood, may thaw them at the inſtant, it is only to render them more hard, when the glow of genial heat is paſſed.</p>
               <p>Aſſembled at the Tennis-court, they encouraged each other; and one mind actuated the whole body, in the preſence of an applauding crowd, they joined hands ſolemnly, and took God to witneſs, that they would not ſeparate, till a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſhould be completed.

                  </gap>, giving freſh vigour to the heroiſm which excited them, produced an overflow of ſenſibility that kindled into a blaze of patriotiſm every ſocial feeling. The dungeons of deſpotiſm and the bayonets ſharpened for maſſacre, were then equally diſregarded even by

the moſt fearful; till, in one of thoſe inſtants of diſintereſted forgetfulneſs of private purſuits, all devoted themſelves to the promotion of public happineſs, promiſing to reſiſt, to the laſt extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, all the efforts of ſuch an inveterate tyranny. The abſent deputies were ſent for; and one, who happened to be ſick, had himſelf carried to unite his feeble voice with the general cry. The very ſoldiers alſo, diſobeying their officers, came to be willing centinels at the entrance of the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary of liberty, eagerly imbibing the ſentiments, which they afterwards ſpread through their garriſons.</p>
               <p>This indignity offered to the third eſtate could not fail to excite new ſenſations of diſguſt at Paris; and give a freſh ſpring to the animation of the people at large. Yet, this ſpirited behaviour of of the commons excited only ſupercilious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt at court. For the gay circles there were ſo far ſunk in faſtidious delicacy, and ſqueamiſh reſpect for poliſhed manners, that they could not even diſcover magnanimity in the conduct of a peaſant, or a ſhopkeeper; much leſs grandeur in an aſſembly regardleſs of ceremonials. And not to be deficient themſelves in theſe reſpects, the <hi>ſéance royale</hi> was put off another day, in order that the galleries, which had been erected for the accommodation of ſpectators by the national aſſembly, might be removed.</p>
               <p>This was another injudicious ſtep on the part of the cabinet; becauſe it afforded time for the clergy to unite with the commons, who were in ſearch of a place ſufficiently capacious to contain ſuch a body. At length, collected in a church, the clergy, with ſeveral biſhops at their head, and
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:029916_0096_0FE30A404A4ADB70"/>
two nobles of Dauphiné, joined them; and the place, ſeeming to reflect a ſanctity on their union, tended to conſolidate, under a nobler concave, the reſolution taken in the Tennis-court.</p>
               <p>The following day, the <hi>ſéance royale</hi> really took place, with all the exterior ſplendor uſually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited at theſe ſhows; which hitherto could ſcarcely be termed empty, becauſe they produced the deſired effect. But the public, having their attention tu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d to other things, now viewed with contempt, what had formerly inſpired almoſt idolatrous reſpect. The deputies of the third-eſtate were again ordered to enter by a ſeparate door, and even left a conſiderable time ſtanding expoſed to a heavy ſhower. The people, who were totally excluded, formed themſelves into groups, making indignant comments on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated affronts offered to their repreſentatives, whoſe minds likewiſe recoiled at the idle attempt to impreſs them with an opinion of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificancy; when the very pains taken to do it proclaimed their growing importance in the ſtate.</p>
               <p>The object of the king's ſpeech, on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was to annul the whole proceedings of the national aſſembly, and to hold out certain bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, as lures to ſubmiſſion, which the king meant to grant to the people; as if, obſerves Mirabeau,
<q>the rights of the people, were the favours of the king<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </q>
A declaration of his ſovereign will and pleaſure was then read, in which, making an inſidious attempt to withdraw from the aſſembly the confidence of the public, he declared, that, if they abandoned him, he would provide for the happineſs of his people, without their aſſiſtance,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:029916_0097_0FE309EE00662470"/>
knowing the purport of the inſtructions given to the deputies. The firſt article of the king's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent <hi>intentions,</hi> was to grant to the ſtates-general the power of furniſhing ſupplies; care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſpecifying, however, that it was to conſiſt of the three orders, who were to vote according to the ancient mode. Some other ſalutary plans of reform were alſo brought forward; but always with artful modifications, that would enable the old abuſes to keep a ſure footing. For example, the taxes were to be levied equally; yet a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious reſpect for property ſanction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Under the reign of Louis XV. two hundred and thirty thouſand <hi>lettres de cachet</hi> had been iſſued; and after this, who will aſſert, that this was not an inveterate evil, which ought to be eradicated; for it is an inſult to human reaſon, to talk of the modification of ſuch abuſes, as ſeem to be experiments to try how far human patience can be ſtretched.</note> though his majeſty wiſhed to ſecure perſonal freedom, was hinted at as incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with public ſafety, and the preſervation of the honour of private familes. The liberty of the preſs was allowed to be neceſſary; but the ſtates-general were requeſted to point out a mode of rendering it compatible with the reſpect due to religion, to morality, and to the honour of the citizens. The tenor of all the reſt of the articles was the ſame: commencing with a plan of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, and concluding with the <hi>ifs</hi> and <hi>buts,</hi> that were to render it void.—Then winding round to the grand object of the meeting, the king terminated his diſcourſe, with ſaying, forgetful that this was not the period to imagine himſelf

               </p>
               <p>The majority of the nobles, and the minority of the clergy, obeyed this preremptory order, and obſeq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>bly, however, remained ſitting, preſerving a ſilence, more menacing and terrible, than the <hi>I will,</hi> or <hi>I command,</hi> of the cabinet; when the grand maſter of the ceremonies entered, and addreſſing himſelf to the preſident, reminded him, in the king's name, of the order given to ſeparate immediately. The preſident anſwered,
<q>that the aſſembly was not conſtituted to receive orders from any perſon;</q>
but Mirabeau, who thought this reply too tame, ſtarted up, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing the meſſenger, ſaid:
<q>yes; we have heard the intentions which the king has been induced to utter; and you cannot be his organ in this aſſembly.—You, who have neither ſeat, nor right to ſpeak, ought not to remind us of his diſcourſe. However, to avoid all equivocation or delay, I declare to you, that if you are charged to make us go from hence, you ſhould demand orders to employ force; for only the bayonet can oblige us to quit our places.</q>
It is difficult to conceive the ardour inſpired by this prompt eloquence. It's fire flew from breaſt to breaſt, whilſt a whiſper ran round, that what
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:029916_0099_0FE30A76C7A40E00"/>
Mirabeau had juſt uttered, gave a finiſhing ſtroke to the revolution.</p>
               <p>A warm debate enſued; and the aſſembly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their adherence to their former decrees, the abbé Siéyes ſaid, in his dry, cogent manner:
<q>gentlemen, you are to day what you were yeſterday.</q>
A motion was then made, by Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabean, who ſuggeſted, as a prudent precaution againſt the meaſures of a deſperatec abal, that the perſon of each deputy ſhould be pronounced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violable; and, after a ſlight diſcuſſion, it was carried unanimouſly.</p>
               <p>From this moment we may conſider the nation and court at open war. The court had at their command the whole military force of the empire, amounting, at leaſt, to 200,000 men. The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, on the contrary, had only their bare arms, invigorated, it is true, by the new-born love of freedom, to oppoſe to the various weapons of tyranny. But the army, partaking of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon miſery, were not deaf to the complaints or arguments of their fellow citizens: and they were particularly led to conſider them with compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency, becauſe a juſt apprehenſion, or prudent foreſight, had induced many of the popular aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, to inſert a cla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the ſoldiers ſhould be augmented. Thus recognized as fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, this claſs of men, whom it had been the policy of the deſpots of Europe to keep at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the other inhabitants, making them a diſtinct claſs, to oppreſs and corrupt the reſt, began to feel an intereſt in the common cauſe. But the court, who either could not, or would

not, combine theſe important facts, raſhly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated themſelves into the very quickſand, into which they were vainly endeavouring to drive the commons.</p>
               <p>As Necker had not attended in his place, at the <hi>ſéance royale,</hi> it gave colour to the rumour, which had for ſome time prevailed, that he propoſed to retire from the miniſtry: ſo that, when the king returned, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e was followed by an immenſe crowd, who could not conceal their diſcontent. Under the influence alſo of the ſame fear, a number of the deputies haſtened to Necker, to intreat him not to reſign. And the conſternation increaſing, the queen, who has ever been the firſt to deſert her own plans, when there appeared a ſhadow of perſonal danger, ſent for him; and, the better to cover the project of the cabinet, prevailed on him not to quit his poſt. The object of the cabinet he either had not the penetration to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover; or he had not ſufficient magnanimity to reſign a place, that gratified equally his pride and his avarice. This meaſure tended to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillize the minds of the people, though it was undermining their cauſe: for truſting to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of this miniſter, who promiſed,
<q>to live or die with them,</q>
they did not perceive, that he wanted the energy of ſoul neceſſary to enable him to act up to the principles he profeſſed. However, the cauſe of liberty, as circumſtances have proved, did not depend on the talents of one or two men.—It was the fiat of the nation; and the machinations of the tyrants of Europe have not ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="90" facs="unknown:029916_0101_0FE30A784E23E750"/>
reform, to the commiſſion of actions the moſt cruel and unjuſt. Every thing was effected by natural cauſes; and we ſhall find, if we take a curſory view of the progreſs of knowledge, that it's advance towards ſimple principles is invariably in a ratio, which muſt ſpeedily change the tangled ſyſtem of European politics.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſéance royale</hi> produced ſo little effect, that the aſſembly, as if their ſittings had never been interrupted, met the next day at the old hall; and the day after, the minority of the nobles, which conſiſted of forty-ſeven members, came to incorporate themſelves with the commons. All of theſe, and particularly the duke of Orleans, who led them, acquired by this popular conduct, the love and confidence of the nation. How far they merited it, deceiving the public, or them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, their future conduct will beſt explain.</p>
               <p>The intereſting events, in fact, wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ch almoſt daily occurred, at the commencement of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, fired the fancies of men of different deſcriptions; till, forgetting every ſelfiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, the rich and poor ſaw through the ſame focus. But, when the former had time to cool, and felt more forcibly than the latter the inconveniences of anarchy, they returned with freſh vigour to their old ground; embracing with redoubled ardour, the prejudices which paſſion, not conviction, had chaſed from the field, during the heat of action. This was a ſtrong reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the ſtaunch ariſtocrats; becauſe theſe were moſtly good, but ſhort-ſighted people, who really wiſhed, that juſtice might be eſtabliſhed, as the foundation of the new government, though
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:029916_0102_0FE30A4BADFE4AC0"/>
they flinched when their preſent eaſe was diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and it was neceſſary to give more than good wiſhes.</p>
               <p>This minority of nobles muſt certainly be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have acted more prudently than their peers; and ſeveral of them, the moſt reſpectable men of that claſs, both in talents and morals, were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably actuated by half comprehended principles. The great body of the nobles, nevertheleſs, and the minority of the clergy, continued to meet in different chambers, where their idle deliberations marked their decayed influence. For, ſhrinking into nothing, their preſent ſtruggles to regain their power were as fruitleſs, as their former efforts had been preſumptuous. Yet the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies and contumely of the nobility continued to agitate the commons; who, animated by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs of the juſtice of their cauſe, and feeling that they poſſeſſed the confidence of the public, determined to proceed with the objects of their meeting, without the concurrence of the firſt order; proving to them, when it was too late to preſerve their factitious diſtinctions, that their power and authority were at an end. In vain were they told, that they were acting contrary to their true intereſt, and riſking the ſalvation of their privileges. In vain did one of the moſt moderate of the deputies<note n="*" place="bottom">Count Lally Tolendal.</note> remonſtrate with them, on what, moſt probably, would be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their obſtinacy. No argument could move them; and, blind to the danger with which they were threatened, they perſiſted to attend their councils, without any determinate rule of
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:029916_0103_0FE30A03809FE598"/>
action. It is true, the duke of Luxembourgh declared, in a private committee held by the king, on the <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> of June, that
<q>the diviſion of the orders would controul the exorbitant claims of the people, and preſerve thoſe of the monarch; united,</q>
added he,
<q>they know no maſter, divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they are your ſubjects;</q>
and he concluded, with emphatically ſaying, that
<q>it would ſave the independence of the crown, and ſtamp with nullity the proceedings of the national aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</q>
Theſe were manly, though not patriotic ſentiments; and if the court had rallied round them, and defended them to the laſt extremity, they would at any rate have prevented their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, by avoiding the crooked path of treachery. But abandoning all dignity of conduct, they truſted to the art of manoeuvring, which defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the people, they were left entirely at their mercy.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the improvement of ſociety, ſince the deſtruction of the Roman empire, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland ſeems to have led the way, rendering certain obſtinate prejudices almoſt null, by a gradual change of opinion. This obſervation, which facts will ſupport, may be brought for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, to prove, that juſt ſentiments gain footing only in proportion as the underſtanding is enlarg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by cultivation, and freedom of thought, inſtead of being cramped by the dread of baſtiles and inquiſitions. In Italy and France, for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample where the mind dared to exerciſe itſelf only to form the taſte, the nobility were, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the word, a caſt keeping aloof from the people; whilſt in England they inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingled with the commerical men, whoſe equal
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:029916_0104_0FE30A4D8D51D9E0"/>
or ſuperior fortunes made the nobles overlook their inequality of birth: thus giving the firſt blow to the ignorant pride that retarded the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of juſt opinions reſpecting true dignity of character. This monied intereſt, from which political improvement firſt emanates, was not yet formed in France; and the ridiculous pride of her nobles, which led them to believe, that the purity of their families would be ſullied, if they agreed to act in the ſame ſphere with the people, was a prevailing motive, that prevented their junction with the commons. But the more licentious part of the clergy, who followed with a truer ſcent their own intereſt, thought it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to eſpouſe, in time, the cauſe of the power from whence their influence derived it's greateſt force; and from which alone they could hope for ſupport. This ſchiſm proved, as it promiſed, dangerous to the views of the court.</p>
               <p>The deſertion of the clergy rendered the nobility outrageous, and haſtened the criſis when the important conteſt was to be brought to an iſſue.—Then it was that the king perceived how contemptible his undecided conduct had been, and exclaiming, it is ſaid, confidently,
<q>that he remained ALONE in the midſt of the nation, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied with the eſtabliſhment of concord.</q>

               <p>This total want of character cauſed him to be flattered by all parties, and truſted by none. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificancy had diſtinguiſhed his manners in his

own court. Actions without energy, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions without ſincerity, exhibiting a conduct deſtitute of ſteadineſs, made the cabinet concert all their meaſures regardleſs of his opinion, leaving to the queen the taſk of perſuading him to adopt them. The evil did not reſt even here; for the different parties following ſeparate views, the flexibility of his temper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed him to ſanction things the moſt at variance, and moſt dangerous to his future honour and ſafety. For it appears obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, that whatever party had prevailed, he could only be conſidered as an inſtrument; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming uſeleſs when the object ſhould be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieved, would be treated with diſreſpect. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of revolution drawing into action the worſt as well as the beſt of men; and as audacity, in general, triumphs over modeſt merit, when the political horizon is ruffled by tempeſt; it amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a moral certainty, that the line of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct purſued by the king would lead to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and ruin.</p>
               <p>Seeing, however, that the people were unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in their approbation of the conduct of their repreſentatives, and watchful to diſcover the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of their enemies; it could not but occur to the cabinet, that the only way to lull attention to ſleep, was to affect to ſubmit to neceſſity. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, fearing, if they continued to reſort to their different chambers, that their plot would take wind before all the agents were aſſembled, a freſh inſtance of diſſimulation evinced, that their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity equalled their ſtupidity. For the king was now prevailed on to write to the preſidents of the nobility, and the minority of the clergy, requeſting them, to repreſent to thoſe two orders

the neceſſity of uniting with the third, to proceed to the diſcuſſion of his propoſals, made at the <hi>ſéance royale.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The clergy immediately acquieſced; but the nobility continued to oppoſe a junction ſo humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating, till the court invented a pretext of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſave the credit of their mock dignity, by declaring that the life of the king would be in imminent danger, ſhould the nobles continue to reſiſt the deſire of the nation. Pretending to believe this report, for the ſecret of the cabinet was buzzed amongſt them, and appearing to wiſh to bury all rivalry in royalty, they attended at the common hall, the 27th. Yet even there, the firſt ſtep they took was to enter a proteſt, in order to guard againſt this conceſſion being made a precedent.</p>
               <p>A general joy ſucceeded the terror which had been engendered in the minds of the people by their contumelious perverſneſs; and the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, cheriſhing the moſt ſanguine expectations, reckoned, that an unity of exertions would ſecure to them a redreſs of grievances.</p>
               <p>It is perhaps unneceſſary to dwell, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on the inſenſibility of the court, and the credulity of the people; as they ſeem the only clues, that will lead us to a preciſe diſcrimination of the cauſes, which completely annihilated all confidence in the miniſters, who have ſucceeded the directors of thoſe infamous meaſures, that ſwept away the whole party; meaſures which involved thouſands of innocent people in the ſame ruin, and have produced a clamour againſt the proceedings of the nation, that has obſcured the glory of her labours.

through all their windings, the crimes and follies produced by want of ſagacity, and juſt principles of action.

               <p>Loſt then in the moſt luxurious pleaſures, or managing court intrigues, the queen became a profound diſſembler; and her heart hardened by ſenſual enjoyments to ſuch a degree, that when her family and favourites ſtood on the brink of ruin, her little portion of mind was employed only to preſerve herſelf from danger. As a proof of the juſtneſs of this aſſertion, it is only neceſſary to obſerve, that, in the general wreck, not a ſcrap of her writing has been found to criminate her; neither has ſhe ſuffered a word to eſcape her to exaſperate the people, even when burning with rage, and contempt.

Over that of the king ſhe acquired unbounded ſway, when, managing the diſguſt ſhe had for his perſon, ſhe made him pay a kingly price for her favours. A court is the beſt ſchool in the world for actors; it was very natural then for her to become a complete actreſs, and an adept in all the arts of coquetry that debauch the mind, whilſt they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For this returning affection of the people alone was ſufficient to prove to him, that it was not eaſy to eradicate their love for royalty; becauſe, whilſt they were contending for their rights with the nobility, they were happy to receive them as acts of beneficence from the king. But the education of the heir apparent of a crown muſt neceſſarily deſtroy the common ſagacity and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a man; and the education of this monarch, like that of Louis XV, only tended to make him a ſenſual bigot.</p>

Beſides; kings, who without having their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings enlarged, are ſet above attending to the forms of morality, which ſometimes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it's ſpirit, are always particularly fond of thoſe religions ſyſtems, which, like a ſponge, wipe out the crimes that haunt the terrified ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of unſound minds.</p>
               <p>It has been the policy of the court of France, to throw an odium on the underſtanding of the king, when it was laviſhing praiſes on the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his heart. Now it is certain, that he poſſeſſed a conſiderable portion of ſenſe and diſcernment; though he wanted that firmneſs of mind, which conſtitutes character; or, in more preciſe words, the power of acting accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the dictates of a man's own reaſon. He was a tolerable ſcholar; had ſufficient patience to learn the Engliſh language; and was an inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious mechanic. It is alſo well known, that it the council, when he followed only the light of his own reaſon, he often fixed on the moſt ſage meaſures, which he was afterwards perſuaded to abandon. But death ſeems to be the ſport of kings, and, like the Roman tyrant, whoſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary amuſement was transfixing flies, this man, whoſe milkineſs of heart has been perpetually contraſted with the pretended watrineſs of his head, was extremely fond of ſeeing thoſe gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maces, made by tortured animals, which rouſe to pleaſure ſluggiſh, groſs ſenſations. The queen, however, prevailed on him not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt

Haughtily then diſregarding the ſuggeſtions of humanity, and even prudence, they determined to ſubvert every thing ſooner than reſign their privileges; and this tenacity will not appear aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing, if we call to mind, that they conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the people as beaſts of burden, and trod them under foot with the mud. This is not a figure of rhetoric; but a melancholy truth! For it is notorious, that, in the narrow ſtreets of Paris, where there are no foot-ways to ſecure the walkers from danger, they were frequently killed, without ſlackening, by the leaſt emotion of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling, the gallop of the thoughtleſs being, whoſe manhood was buried in a factitious character.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not now recapitulate the feudal tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, which the progreſs of civilization has rendered nugatory; it is ſufficient to obſerve, that, as neither the life nor property of the

citizens was ſecured by equal laws, both were often wantonly ſported with by thoſe who could do it with impunity. Arbitrary decrees have too often aſſumed the ſacred majeſty of law; and when men live in continual fear, and know not what they have to apprehend, they always become cunning and puſillanimous. Thus the abject manners, produced by deſpotiſm of any ſpecies, ſeem to juſtify them, in the eyes of thoſe who only judge of things from their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent appearance. This leads, likewiſe, to an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that partly accounts for the want of induſtry and cleanlineſs in France; for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are very apt to ſport away their time, when they cannot look forward, with ſome degree of certainty, to the conſolidation of a plan of future eaſe.</p>
               <p>Every precaution was taken to divide the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and prevent any ties of affection, ſuch as ought always to unite man with man, in all the relationſhips of life, from bringing the two ranks together with any thing like equality to conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them. If, for inſtance, the ſon of a noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man happened ſo far to forget his rank, as to marry a woman of low birth; what miſery have not thoſe unfortunate creatures endured!— confined in priſons, or hunted out of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon neſt, as contagious intruders. And if we remember alſo, that, while treated with contempt, only a twentieth part of the profit of his labour fell to the ſhare of the huſbandman, we ſhall ceaſe to inquire, why the nobles oppoſed inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, that muſt neceſſarily have overturned the fabric of deſpotiſm.</p>

But Paris, that city which contains ſo many different characters—that vortex, which draws every vice into it's centre—that repoſitory of all the materials of voluptuous degeneracy— that den of ſpies and aſſaſſins—contained likewiſe a number of enlightened men, and was able to raiſe a very formidable force, to defend its opinions.</p>
               <p>The cabinet ſaw it's riſing ſpirit with ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion; and, reſorting to their old wiles, produced a ſcarcity of bread, hoping that, when the people ſhould be diſheartened, the approaching army under Broglio would bring the whole affair to a ſpeedy iſſue. But circumſtances ſeemed fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the people; for the electors of Paris, after they had choſen their deputies, the election having been protracted very late, continued to meet at the <hi>Hôtel-de-Ville,</hi> to prepare the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which they had not time to digeſt before the aſſembling of the ſtates-general.</p>
               <p>At this juncture alſo, a ſpacious ſquare, equally devoted to buſineſs and pleaſure, called the <hi>Palais Royale,</hi> became the rendezvous of the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. There the moſt ſpirited gave lectures, whilſt more modeſt men read the popular papers and pamphlets, on the benefits of liberty, and the crying oppreſſions of abſolute governments. This was the centre of information; and the whole city flocking thither, to talk or to liſten, returned home warmed with the love of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,

Camps were traced out for ſtill more: and the poſts, that commanded the roads leading to Paris, were filled with ſoldiers. The courtiers, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to repreſs their joy, vaunted, that the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aſſembly would ſoon be diſſolved, and the rebellious deputies ſilenced by impriſonment, of death. And ſhould even the French ſoldiers abandon them, among whom there were ſome ſymptoms of revolt, the court depended on the foreign troops, to ſtrike terror into the very heart of Paris and Verſailles. The gathering army was already a very formidable force; but the ſpirit of enthuſiaſm, and a keen ſenſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, rendered more ſharp by inſults, had ſuch an effect on the people, that inſtead of being intimidated, they coolly began to prepare for defence.</p>
               <p>All had heard, or were now informed of the efforts made by the Americans to maintain their liberty.—All had heard of the glorious firmneſs of a handful of raw Boſtonian militia, who, on Bunker's-hill, reſiſted the Britiſh diſciplined

troops, crimſoning the plains of Charleſtown with the blood of the ſtower of their enemy's army. This leſſon for tyrants had reſounded through the kingdom; and it ought to have taught them, that men determined to be free are always ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to mercenary battalions even of veterans.</p>
               <p>The popular leaders had alſo taken the ſureſt means to ingratiate themſelves with the ſoldiery, by mixing with them, and continually inſinuating, that citizens ought not to allow the baſe miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of power, to treat them like paſſive inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of miſchief. Beſides, it was natural to expect, that the military, the moſt idle body of men in the kingdom, ſhould attend to the topics of the day, and profit by the diſcuſſions, that diſſeminated new political principles. And ſuch an influence had the arguments in favour of liberty on their minds, that, ſo early as the 23d of June, during a ſlight riot, two companies of the grenadiers refuſed to fire on the people, whom they were ſent to diſperſe. But theſe ſymptoms of refractorineſs rouſed the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the court, inſtead of putting it on it's guard: conſequently ſeveral were ſent to priſon, and the troops were confined to their barracks; yet, regardleſs of theſe orders, they came in crowds to the <hi>Palais Royale,</hi> a day or two after, eager to unite their voices with the general ſhout, <hi>vive la nation,</hi> which ſpoke the preſent ſentiments of the people. The regiments of French, alſo, that now arrived, to be ſtationed with the foreign troops round Paris, were conducted to this hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed of patriotiſm; and, meeting with the moſt cordial reception, they liſtened with intereſt to the lively repreſentations of the enormities com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

               <p>Whilſt theſe opinions were taking root, the people heard that eleven of the French guards, confined in the Abbey, becauſe they would not obey the order to fire on the populace, were to be transferred to the <hi>Bicetre,</hi> the moſt ignominious of all the priſons. The conteſt now commenced; for the people haſtened to deliver them, and, forcing their way, emancipated their friends; and even the huſſars, who were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to quell the diſturbance, laid down their arms.

Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubtedly I do not know every pretext, every artifice of the enemies of reformation, ſince I cannot divine with what plauſible reaſon they have coloured the pretended want of troops, at a moment, when not only their inutility, but their danger, ſtrikes every mind.</q>

                  <q>With what eye will the people, haraſſed by ſo many calamities, ſee this ſwarm of idle ſoldiers come to diſpute with them their morſel of bread? The contraſt of the plenty enjoyed by one, with the indigence of the other; of the ſecurity of the ſoldiers, to whom the manna falls, without it's being neceſſary for them to think of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, with the anguiſh of the people, who obtain nothing but by hard labour and painful ſweat; is ſufficient to make every heart ſink with deſpondency. Added to this, gentlemen, the preſence of the troops heats the imagination of the populace; and by continually preſenting new fears, excites an univerſal efferveſcence, till the citizens are at their very fire-ſides a prey to every kind of terror. The people, rouſed and agitated, form tumultuous aſſemblies; and, giving way to their impetuoſity, precipitate themſelves into danger—for fear neither calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates nor reaſons!</q>
He concluded with moving an addreſs to the king, repreſenting, that the people were extremely alarmed by the aſſembling
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:029916_0121_0FE30A8C9D450AC0"/>
of ſuch a number of troops, and the preparations made to form camps during this ſeaſon of ſcarcity; and to remonſtrate reſpecting the conduct of thoſe, who ſought to deſtroy the confidence that ought to ſubſiſt between the king and the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people—a confidence, which alone can enable them to fulfil their functions, and eſtabliſh the reform expected from their zeal by a ſuffering nation.</p>
               <p>This ſpeech produced the deſired effect; and the motion being carried, Mirabeau was requeſted to prepare an addreſs for their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>
               <p>The purport of the addreſs was an abridgment of the above ſpeech; reſpectful; nay, even affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate; but ſpirited and noble.</p>
               <p>Yet this remonſtrance, ſo well calculated to preſerve the dignity of the monarch, and appeaſe the agitation of the public, produced no other effect than a ſupercilious anſwer, that only tended to increaſe the want of confidence, to which diſguſt gave a new edge. For, inſtead of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the prayer of the nation, the king aſſerted, that the tumultuous and ſcandalous ſcenes, which had paſſed at Paris, and at Verſailles, under his own eyes, and thoſe of the national aſſembly, were ſufficient to induce him, one of whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal duties it was to watch over the public ſafety, to ſtation troops round Paris.—Still, he declared, that, far from intending to interrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> their freedom of debate, he only wiſhed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them even from all apprehenſion of tumult and violence. If, however, the neceſſary pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the troops continue to give umbrage, he was willing, at the requeſt of the aſſembly, to

transfer the ſtates-general to Noyon or Soiſſons; and to repair himſelf to Compiégne, in order to maintain the requiſite intercourſe with the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. This anſwer ſignified nothing; or, rather, it formally announced, that the king would not ſend away the troops. Obvious as was the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and contemptible as was the diſſimulation, yet, as it came from the ſovereign, the fountain of fortune and honours, ſome of the ſupple hands of the deputies applauded.—But, Mirabeau was not to be cajoled by ſuch ſhallow fallacy.
<q>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,</q>
ſaid he, impatiently,
<q>the goodneſs of the king's heart is ſo well known, that we might tranquilly confide in his virtue, did he always act from himſelf.—But, the aſſurances of the king are no guarantee for the conduct of his miniſters, who have not ceaſed to miſlead his good diſpoſition.—And have we yet to learn, that the habitual confidence of the French in their king is leſs a virtue than a vice, if it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all parts of the adminiſtration?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Who amongſt us is ignorant, in fact, that it is our blind, giddy inconſideration, which has led us from century to century, from fault to fault, to the criſis that now afflicts us, and which ought at laſt to open our eyes, if we have not reſolved to be head-ſtrong children and ſlaves till the end of time?</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The reply of the king is a pointed refuſal. The miniſtry would have it regarded only as a ſimple form of aſſurance and goodneſs; and they have affected to think, that we have made our demand, without attaching much intereſt to it's ſucceſs, and only to appear to have made it. It is neceſſary to undeceive the miniſtry.—Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:029916_0123_0FE30A8F6E467F20"/>
my opinion is, not to fail in the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and reſpect which we owe to the virtues of the king; but I likewiſe adviſe, that we be no more inconſiſtent, timid, and wavering in our meaſures.—Certainly, there is no need to deliberate on the removal propoſed; for, in ſhort, notwithſtanding the king's anſwer, we will not go to Noyon, nor to Soiſſons.—We have not demanded this permiſſion; nor will we, becauſe it is ſcarcely probable, that we ſhould ever deſire to place ourſelves between two or three bodies of troops; thoſe which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt Paris, and thoſe which might fall upon us from Flanders and Alface. We have demanded the removal of the troops—that was the object of our addreſs!—We have not aſked permiſſion to ſlee before them; but only that they ſhould be ſent from the capital. And it is not for ourſelves, that we have made this demand; for they know very well, that it was ſuggeſted by a concern for the general intereſt, not by any ſentiment of fear. At this moment, the preſence of the troops diſturbs the public order, and may produce the moſt melancholy events.— Our removal, far from preventing, would, on the contrary, only aggravate the evil. It is neceſſary, then, to reſtore peace, in ſpite of the friends of diſorder; it is neceſſary, to be conſiſtent with ourſelves; and to be ſo, we have only to adhere to one line of conduct, which is to inſiſt, without relaxing, that the troops be ſent away, as the only ſure way to obtain it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This ſpeech, delivered on the 11th of July, produced no further deciſion in the aſſembly,
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:029916_0124_0FE30A5C8FE37588"/>
though it kept the attention of the members fixed to a point.</p>
               <p>But things were now drawing rapidly to a criſis; for this very day Necker, who had been retained in place, only to hoodwink the people, was diſmiſſed, with an injunction not to mention his diſmiſſion; and to leave the kingdom in twenty-four hours. Theſe orders he ſervilely obeyed; and, with all the promptitude of perſonal fear, ſaid, without the leaſt emotion, to the nobleman, who brought the king's commands,
<q>we ſhall meet this evening at the council;</q>
and continued to converſe, in his uſual ſtrain of ſmoothneſs, with the company at dinner. Miſerable weakneſs! This man, who profeſſed himſelf the friend of the people, and who had ſo lately promiſed 'to live or die with them,' had not, when brought to the teſt, ſufficient magnanimity to warn them where danger threatened —For he muſt have known, that this diſmiſſion was the ſignal of hoſtilities: yet fleeing like a felon, he departed in diſguiſe, keeping the ſecret with all the caution of cowardice.<note n="*" place="bottom">Such is ever the conduct of <hi>ſoi-diſant</hi> patriots.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The next day, the appointment of the new miniſtry, men particularly obnoxious to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, made it known to the people; who viewed with melancholy horror the awful horizon, where had long been gathering the ſtorm now ready to burſt on their devoted heads. The agitation of the public mind, indeed, reſembled a troubled ſea; which, having been put in motion by a raging tornado, gradually ſwells, until the whole element, wave rolling on wave, exhibits one unbounded

commotion. All eyes were now opened, all ſaw the approaching blaſt; the hollow murmurs of which had inſpired a confuſed terror for ſome time paſt.</p>
               <p>It had been propoſed on the 10th, at the <hi>Hôtel-de-Ville,</hi> as a regulation of the <hi>Garde-Bourgeoiſe,</hi> that twelve hundred men ſhould be raiſed at a time, to be relieved every week; and the capital having been divided, at the election, into ſixty diſtricts, only twenty would be called out of each. And it was further reſolved, that the diſtricts ſhould reſt embodied until the entire evacuation of the troops, excepting thoſe who formed the common complement of the guards. The following day it was decreed; an addreſs was voted to the national aſſembly, to requeſt their mediation with the king, to ſanction im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately the city militia; and the ſittings of the committee were adjourned till Monday, the 13th. But ſome of the electors, having heard on Sunday, that the populace were all repairing to the <hi>Hôtel-de-Ville,</hi> haſtened there about ſix o'clock in the evening, and found the hall indeed crowded with people of all conditions. A thouſand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed voices demanded arms, and orders to ſound the <hi>tocſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At eight o'clock, the patrol guard was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, at the <hi>Hôtel-de-Ville,</hi> and the multitude preſſed on the ſoldiers to diſarm them; redoubling the cry for arms at the moment; and even threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to ſet fire to the hall. But, ſtill obſerving ſome reſpect for ſubordination, they demanded, a little imperiouſly, it is true, an order, in virtue of which, the citizens might arm them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to repulſe the danger that menaced the

capital—and amidſt theſe clamours, ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate reports painted, in the moſt lively colours, this danger.</p>
               <p>One of the crowd ſaid, that, no ſooner had the news of the diſmiſſion of Necker reached Paris, than the people haſtened to a ſculptor's, and, ſeizing the buſts of that miniſter, and of the duke of Orleans, they were now actually carrying them through the ſtreets:—Another informed them, that the multitude had ruſhed into the different theatres, at the hour of opening them, and required, that they ſhould be inſtantly ſhut;<note n="*" place="bottom">This is an event much more important at Paris, than it would be in London.</note> and that in conſequence all the ſpectators had been ſent away:—A third anounced four cannons, placed at the entrance of the <hi>Champs Elyſées,</hi> with their cannoneers ready to light their matches, which were to begin the combat; and that theſe four cannons were ſupported by a regiment of cavalry, which, advancing under the command of the prince de Lambeſc to the place of Louis XV. was ſtationed by the bridge that leads to the Thuilleries. He added alſo, that a <hi>cavalier</hi> of this regiment, paſſing by a ſoldier of the French guards, had fired his piſtol at him; and, that the prince de Lambeſc himſelf had galloped into the garden, ſabre in hand, followed by a detachment, who put to flight the old men, women, and children, that were peaceably taking their cuſtomary walk; nay, that he had actually killed, with his own hand, an old man, who was eſcaping from the tumult. The reporter, it is true, forgot to notice, that the populace
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:029916_0127_0FE30A9396C9DCC0"/>
had begun to pelt the prince with the ſtones that were lying ready, near the buildings which were not finiſhed. Startled, perhaps, by this reſiſtance, and deſpiſing the mob, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, only by his preſence, to have intimidated, in a delirium, moſt probably, of terror and aſtoniſhment, he wounded an unarmed man, who fled before him. Be that as it may, this wanton outrage excited the indignation neceſſary to fire every ſpirit.</p>
               <p>The electors being ſtill preſſed for arm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To arms! To arms! re-echoed from all quarters—and the whole city was inſtantly in motion, ſeeking for weapons of defence. Whilſt the women and children rent the air with ſhrieks and lamentations, the cannons were fired; and the <hi>tocſins</hi> of the different pariſh churches joined by degrees, to excite, and continue, the univerſal alarm.</p>
               <p>Still all their thoughts were turned on defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive meaſures. Many of the citizens, by ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacking the warehouſes of arms, and catching up ſpits and pokers, appeared with weapons in their hands to ſecond their determinate counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; and being joined by ſome of the French guards, more completely accoutred, forced thoſe foreign mercenaries, who had firſt awakened their fury, to retreat, fleeing like the beaſts <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the deſert, before the bold and generous lion. Though victorious in this midnight fray, becauſe determined to conquer, ſtill they had ſcarcely any fire arms; and were as inexpert in the uſe of thoſe they found, as the inhabitants of capitals commonly are.—But indignation made each of them (ſo reſtleſs was their courage) ſeize ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to defend himſelf with: hammers, axes, ſhovels, pikes, all were ſought for, and clenched in hands nerved by heroiſm; yes, by true heroiſm, for perſonal ſafety was diſregarded in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon danger. Wives aſſiſted to beat out pikes for their huſbands, and children ran about to pile up ſtones in readineſs for to-morrow. To increaſe the apprehenſions of the night, one of the barriers was ſet on fire; and a band of deſperate robbers, taking advantage of the confuſion, began to pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage ſome houſes. To arms! was the cry of danger, and the watch-word of the city—for who could cloſe their eyes? Whilſt the tocſin drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the murmurs of rage, and diſtreſs, made the confuſion ſolemn.</p>
               <p>Different ſounds excited different emotions at Verſailles; for there the heart, beating high with exultation, gave way to the moſt intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate joy.—Already the courtiers imagined, that the whole miſchief was cruſhed, and that they had the aſſembly at their mercy.</p>
               <p>Intoxicated by ſucceſs, a little too ſoon reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on, the queen, the count d'Artois, and their favourites, viſited the haunt of the bribed ruffians, who were lurking in ambuſh, ready to fall upon their prey; encouraging them by an engaging affability of behaviour, and more ſubſtantial marks of favour, to forget every conſideration
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:029916_0129_0FE30A9BA8B11188"/>
but their commands. And ſo flattered were they by the honied words, and coquetiſh ſmiles of the queen, that they promiſed, as they drained the cup in her honour, not to ſheath their ſwords, till France was compelled to obedience, and the national aſſembly diſperſed. With ſavage fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city they danced to the ſound of muſic attuned to ſlaughter, whilſt plans of death and devaſtation gave the zeſt to the orgies, that worked up their animal ſpirits to the higheſt pitch. After this account, any reflections on the baneful effects of power, or on the unreſtrained indulgence of pleaſure, that could thus baniſh tenderneſs from the female boſom, and harden the human heart, would be an inſult to the reader's ſenſibility.</p>
               <p>How ſilent is now Verſailles!—The ſolitary foot, that mounts the ſumptuous ſtair-caſe, reſts on each landing-place, whilſt the eye traverſes the void, almoſt expecting to ſee the ſtrong images of fancy burſt into life.—The train of the Louiſes, like the poſterity of the Banquoes, paſs in ſolemn ſadneſs, pointing at the nothingneſs of grandeur, fading away on the cold canvaſs, which covers the nakedneſs of the ſpacious walls —whilſt the gloomineſs of the atmoſphere gives a deeper ſhade to the gigantic figures, that ſeem to be ſinking into the embraces of death.</p>
               <p>Warily entering the endleſs apartments, half ſhut up, the fleeting ſhadow of the penſive wanderer, reflected in long glaſſes, that vainly gleam in every direction, ſlacken the nerves, without appalling the heart; though laſcivious pictures, in which grace varniſhes voluptuouſneſs, no longer ſeductive, ſtrike continually home to the boſom the melancholy moral, that anticipates

the frozen leſſon of experience. The very air is chill, ſeeming to clog the breath; and the waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dampneſs of deſtruction appears to be ſtealing into the vaſt pile, on every ſide.</p>
               <p>The oppreſſed heart ſeeks for relief in the garden; but even there the ſame images glide along the wide neglected walks—all is fearfully ſtill; and, if a little rill creeping through the gathering moſs down the caſcade, over which it uſed to ruſh, bring to mind the deſcription of the grand water-works, it is only to excite a languid ſmile at the futile attempt to equal nature.</p>
               <p>Lo! this was the palace of the great king!— the abode of magnificence!

               </argument>
               <p>EARLY in the morning of the 13th, the electors haſtened to the centre of the general alarm, the <hi>Hôtel-de-ville,</hi> and, urged by the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of the moment, paſſed the decrees, under deliberation, for the immediate embodying the <hi>garde-bourgeoiſe,</hi> without waiting for the requeſted ſanction of the national aſſembly. The greater number then withdrew, to convoke their diſtricts; whilſt the few that remained endeavoured to calm the tumult that was every moment augmenting, by informing the people of this decree; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting at the ſame time, to the citizens, the cogent motives which ſhould induce them to ſeparate, and each repair to his own diſtrict to be enrolled. But the crowd again called for arms, pretending, that there was a great number concealed in an arſenal, which nobody could point out. To quiet theſe clamours for a moment, the people
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:029916_0133_0FE309F99F46C660"/>
were referred to the <hi>prévot des marchands</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The mayor.</note>. He accordingly came and requeſted, that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude would confirm his nomination to the func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which his majeſty had confided to him. A general acclamation was the ſignal of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; and the aſſembled electors immediately turned their attention to the ſerious buſineſs before them.</p>
               <p>They then eſtabliſhed a <hi>permanent committee,</hi> to keep up a conſtant intercourſe with the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent diſtricts, to which the citizens were again exhorted inſtantly to return, with all the arms they had collected; that thoſe arms might be properly diſtributed among the Pariſian militia. But it was impoſſible to purſue theſe important deliberations, with any degree of order, for a freſh multitude was continually ruſhing forward, to report freſh intelligence; often falſe or exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated, and always alarming. The barriers, they were told, were on fire; a religious houſe had been pillaged; and a hoſtile force was on the road, in full march, to fall upon the citizens. An immenſe number of coaches, waggons, and other carriages were actually brought to the door of the hotel; and the demands of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, who had been ſtopped going out of Paris, mingling with the cries of the multitude, eager to be led towards the troops, whoſe approach had been announced, were only drowned by the more lively inſtances of the deputies of the ſixty diſtricts, demanding arms and ammunition, to render them active. To appeaſe them, and gain time, the mayor promiſed, if they would be
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:029916_0134_0FE30A1C29003740"/>
tranquil till five o'clock in the evening, then to diſtribute a number of fuſils; which were to be furniſhed by the director of a manufactory.</p>
               <p>Theſe aſſurances produced a degree of calm. Taking advantage of it, the committee deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that the Pariſian militia, for the preſent, ſhould conſiſt of 48,000 citizens; and that the officers ſhould be named by each diſtrict. Many ſubordinate decrees alſo paſſed, all tending to prevent the diſaſters naturally produced by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion; and to provide for the ſubſiſtence of the city. The French guards, who had during the night aſſiſted the citizens, now came to teſtify their attachment to the common cauſe; and to beg to be enrolled with them. The commander of the city watch, a military body, likewiſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf; to aſſure the committee, that the troops under his direction were diſpoſed to obey their orders and aſſiſt in defending the city.</p>
               <p>Among the carriages ſtopped was one of the prince de Lambeſc. The people imagined, that they had caught the prince himſelf; and, when they were convinced of their miſtake,, it was impoſſible to ſave the coach, though the horſes were put into a neighbouring ſtable; and the portmanteau, carefully detached, was lodged in the hall. This trivial circumſtance is worthy of notice, becauſe it ſhows the reſpect then paid to property; and that the public mind was entirely fixed on thoſe grand objects, which abſorb pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate paſſions and intereſts. Stung alſo to the quick by the inſulting diſregard of their claims, the people forcibly felt an indignant ſenſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, which rendered the ſtruggle heroic.</p>

Trenches were thrown up, ſeveral of the ſtreets unpaved, and barricadoes formed in the ſuburos—Defence was the ſole object of every perſon's thoughts, and deriding perſonal danger, all were preparing to fell their lives at a dear rate, furbiſhing up old weapons, or forging new. The old men, women, and children, were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in making pikes; whilſt the able bodied men paraded the ſtreets, in an orderly manner, with moſt reſolute looks, yet avoiding every kind of violence: there was, in fact, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This engaged their attention a ſhort time; but in the evening the demand for arms became more preſſing than ever, mingled with a hoarſe cry of perfidy and treaſon, levelled againſt the mayor; which for a while, was ſilenced by the arrival of a number of military cheſts, thought to contain arms, and theſe were ſuppoſed to be thoſe promiſed by the mayor. Every poſſible precaution was immediately taken by the electors, to have them ſpeedily conveyed into the cellar, that they might be given to thoſe who knew beſt how to make uſe of them; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being caught up by the unſkilful. The French guards had merited the confidence of the citizens; and four members of the committe, after ſome deliberation, were appointed to haſten to them, to requeſt that they would come and take charge of the diſtribution. In ſhort, great preparations were made, previous to the opening of the cheſts; but—when the cheſts were at laſt opened, in the preſence of a concourſe of people, and found to contain only pieces of old candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks, and ſuch like rubbiſh, the impatience of the multitude, whoſe courage and patriotiſm had been played with all day, inſtantly changed into indignation and fury; and the ſuſpicion of treaſon on the part of the mayor was extended to the whole committee, whom they threatened to blow up in their hall.</p>
               <p>One of the electors, the marquis de la Salle, now obſerved,
<q>that the greateſt inconvenience
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:029916_0137_0FE30AA0C61C29C8"/>
in their preſent cruel ſituation was the want of order, and ſubordination; and that a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence of the different parts of the grand machine, ſo neceſſary to promote expedition and ſucceſs, could not ſubſiſt without a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander known and acknowledged by the public: for all the citizens, become ſoldiers, are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually,</q>
he adds,

It is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary then to name a general of the firſt abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and experience; I am far from thinking myſelf worthy of your choice, though I offer all that I can offer, my fortune and my life; and ſhall willingly ſerve in any poſt.</q>
This motion produced a new diſcuſſion; and the duke d'Aumont was appointed commander in chief. But, he half declining it, though he tried to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſtinate his refuſal, the poſt devolved to the marquis de la Salle, who had been unanimouſly named ſecond; and he entered immediately on the diſcharge of this important truſt. And this nomination contributed to ſupport the exertions of the committee; for in ſpite of the chaotic ſhock, which ſeemed to have thrown into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion all the parts of this great city, the centre of union formed at the <hi>Hôtel-de-Ville,</hi> by the aſſembling of the electors, was in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the ſalvation of the public.

               <p>The national aſſembly, indeed, now appeared with the dignified aſpect becoming the fathers of their country; ſeeing their own danger, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out timidly ſhrinking from the line of conduct, which had provoked the violence of the court: and the preſident, an old man, not being thought equal to the preſent toils of office, a vice-preſident was appointed.</p>
               <p>To fill this poſt, the marquis la Fayette was choſen: a deputy for ſeveral reaſons popular. In America, where he voluntarily riſked his life and fortune, before the French nation eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed their cauſe, he had acquired certain juſt principles of government; and theſe he digeſted to the extent of his underſtanding, which was ſomewhat confined. He poſſeſſed great integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of heart, though he was not without his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the national vanity. He had already diſtinguiſhed himſelf at the meeting of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, by detecting, and expoſing the pecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Calonne, and oppoſing the arbitrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:029916_0139_0FE30A01177FA3E8"/>
of the count d'Artois. Governed by the ſame motives, he had propoſed, likewiſe, during their ſittings, ſome bold plans of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, calculated to reduce the public revenue, and leſſen the grievances of the nation, at the ſame ſtroke.—Amongſt theſe was a motion for the abolition of the Baſtile, and other ſtate pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, throughout the kingdom; and the ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>lettres de cachet.</hi> And ſtill having the ſame objects in view, he, the very day the king's ſneering reply was received (the 11th), laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the aſſembly a propoſal for a DECLARATION OF RIGHTS, ſimilar to that of ſome of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſtates. The marquis de Condorcet had publiſhed a declaration of this kind, to inſtruct the deputies, previous to their meeting. La Fayette had tranſmitted a copy of his declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of rights to the aſſembled electors, to be read to the people; and nothing could be better adapted to keep them firm, telling them to what point they ought to adhere, than the ſhort addreſs with which it commenced.—
<q>Call to mind the ſentiments, that nature has engraven on the heart of every citizen; and which take a new force, when recognized by all.—For a nation to love liberty, it is ſufficient that ſhe knows it; and, to be free, it is ſufficient that ſhe wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Mirabeau, even whilſt ſupporting tenaciouſly the dignity of the national aſſembly, felt a pang of envy, that another ſhould bring forward ſuch an important buſineſs, as the ſketch of a new conſtitution; avowedly that the world

               <p>It was impoſſible now for the whole aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly not to ſee in the change of the miniſtry the danger at hand, the approach of which ſome had affected to treat as a chimera. Determined, however, to continue their labours, in the very face of ſuch hoſtile preparations; yet taking every prudent precaution to ſecure their ſafety, they ſent to inform the king of the diſturbances at Paris; and to point out the evils which me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naced the ſtate, if the troops that inveſted the metropolis were not ſent to more diſtant quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters:—offering, at the ſame time, to throw themſelves between the army and the citizens, to endeavour to ward off the calamities that were likely to enſue. But the king, obſtinately bent to ſupport the preſent meaſures, or controlled by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

<q>that he was the only judge of the neceſſity of withdrawing the troops;</q>
and, treating the offered interpoſition of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties with the moſt ineffable contempt, told them,
<q>that they could be of no uſe at Paris, and were neceſſary at Verſailles, to purſue thoſe important labours, which he ſhould continue to recommend.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This anſwer was no ſooner communicated, than La Fayette moved, that the preſent miniſtry ſhould be declared reſponſible for the conſequence of their obſtinacy: and the aſſembly further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that Necker and the reſt of the miniſtry, who had been juſt ſent away, carried with them their eſteem and regret:—that, alarmed by the apprehenſions of danger produced by the reply of
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:029916_0141_0FE309E004FECF00"/>
the king, they would not ceaſe to inſiſt on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the troops, and the eſtabliſhment of a <hi>garde-bourgeoiſe.</hi>—They repeated their declaration, that no intermediate power can ſubſiſt between the king and the national aſſembly:—and that the public debt having been placed under the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard of French honour, the nation not refuſing to pay the intereſt of it, no power had a right to utter the infamous word—bankruptcy.—In ſhort, the aſſembly declared, that they perſiſted in their former decrees:—and that the preſent reſolves ſhould be preſented to the king, by the preſident, and printed for the information of the public.</p>
               <p>Still the court, deſpiſing the courageous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of the aſſembly, and untouched by the apprehenſions of the people, which ſeemed to be driving them to the deſperation that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conquers, ſtimulated the king to perſiſt in the proſecution of the meaſures, which they had prevailed on him to adopt. The aſſembly, thus rendered vigilant by the various tokens that the criſis was arrived, which was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine their perſonal and political fate, in which that of their country was involved, thought it prudent to make their ſittings permanent. Animated and united by the common danger, they reminded each other,
<q>that, ſhould they periſh, their country ſtill ſurviving would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it's vigour; and that their plans for the good of the public again warming the hearts of Frenchmen, a brave, and generous people would erect on their tomb, as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal trophy, a conſtitution ſolid as reaſon, and durable as time:—whilſt their martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would ſerve as an example, to prove

               <p>It was a circumſtance favourable to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and the cauſe of humanity, that the want of common foreſight in the court prevented their guarding againſt reſiſtance. For ſo negligent were they, that the citizens, who were early in the morning of the 14th every where ſcouring about in ſearch of arms, requeſted of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee an order to demand thoſe they heard were ſtored up at the <hi>hôtel des invalides;</hi> and one of the electors was accordingly ſent with them, to deſire the governor to give up to the nation all the arms and ammunition committed to his care. He replied, that a body of citizens having already been with him, he had ſent to Verſailles for orders, and entreated them to wait till the return of the courier, whom he expected in the courſe of an hour or two. This anſwer at firſt ſatisfied the people, who were preparing to wait contentedly, till one of them obſerving, that this was not a day to loſe time, they inſiſted on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering immediately; and inſtantly made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves

maſters of all the arms they found, to the amount of 30,000 muſkets, and ſix pieces of cannon. A conſiderable quantity of different ſorts of arms were alſo carried away from the <hi>garde meuble</hi> by a leſs orderly party; and fell into the hands of vagabonds, who always mix in a tumult, merely becauſe it is a tumult. A hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty perſons of this deſcription had been diſarmed the preceding night at the <hi>Hôtel-de-Ville,</hi> where they had dropped aſleep on the ſtairs and benches, ſtupified by the brandy they had ſtolen: but, when they awoke, and requeſted work, not having any money or bread, they were ſent to aſſiſt in the making of pikes, and the fabricating of other weapons, which requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little ſkill. None of the citizens appeared, in fact, without ſome weapon, however uncouth, to brandiſh defiance, whilſt ſixty thouſand men, enrolled and diſtributed in different companies, were armed in a more orderly, though not in a more warlike manner. The army of liberty now, indeed, aſſumed a very formidable appearance; yet the cabinet, never doubting of ſucceſs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected in the thoughtleſſneſs of ſecurity, the only way left to oblige the rouſed people to accept of any terms.</p>
               <p>Paris, that immenſe city, ſecond, perhaps, to none in the world, had felt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But directed only by the depraved ſentiments of tyranny, they deemed aſſaſſination the moſt ſpeedy method of bringing the conteſt to an end favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their deſigns. Unaccuſtomed to govern freemen, they dreamt not of the energy of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhaking off it's fetters; or, if their claſſical reveries had taught them a reſpect for a man, whilſt reading the account of that brave hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of Spartans, who drove back, at the ſtraits of Thermopylae, millions of marſhalled ſlaves; they had no conception, that the cauſe of liberty was ſtill the ſame, and that men obeying her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe will always be able to reſiſt the attacks of all the enervated mercenaries of the globe.</p>

Thus much, however, appeared certain; a ſquadron of huſſars had actually been ſeen hovering about the entrance of the <hi>fauxbourg Saint-Antoine,</hi> who diſappeared when two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies of the French guards approached. The people of the ſame fauxbourg obſerved alſo, that the cannons of the Baſtile were turned towards their ſtreet. On receiving this information, a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage was ſent from the committee to the governor of the Baſtile, to expoſtulate with him; and one to each of the diſtricts, deſiring them to ſound an alarm throughout, to break up the pavement of the ſtreets, dig ditches, and oppoſe every obſtacle, in their power, to the entrance of the troops. But though the accounts of the hoſtile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour of ſome of the detachments in the ſkirts of Paris excited terror, there was ſtill reaſon to doubt the real diſpoſition of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery; for a conſiderable number, belonging to different regiments, had preſented themſelves at the barriers with arms and baggage, declared their decided intention to enter into the ſervice of the nation.

They then demanded to paſs into the ſecond court, and did not without great difficulty obtain permiſſion. The little drawbridge, they continued, was let down; but the great one, which led to this court-yard was raiſed, and they entered by an iron gate, opened at the call of the governor. In this court they had ſeen three cannons ready for action, with two cannoneers, thirty-ſix Swiſs, and a dozen of invalids, all under arms; and the ſtaff officers were alſo aſſembled.—They immediately ſummoned them, in the name of the honour of the nation, and for the ſake of their country, to change the direction of the cannons; and at the inſtance even of the governor himſelf, all the officers and ſoldiers ſwore, that the cannons ſhould not be fired, nor would they make any uſe of their arms, unleſs they were attacked.

The rumour was, that fifteen or twenty more, wounded at the ſame time, were left to be taken care of, in different houſes on the way; for that the governor, Delaunay, had let down the firſt draw-bridge to engage the people to approach, who were demanding arms; and that they, entering with confidence on this invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had immediately received a diſcharge of all the muſketry of the fortreſs. This report, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the preſence of the two wounded men, demonſtrated to the committee the perfidy of the troops who guarded the Baſtile, and the neceſſity of ſending ſuccour to thoſe, who, without order or ſufficient force, had commenced the attack. Mean time the fury of the people was directed againſt the mayor, who endeavoured by various ſubterfuges to appeaſe the rage which had been excited by his vain promiſes of procuring arms. He had, it is true, ſeveral times diſperſed the multitude by ſending them to different places with orders for arms, where he knew they were not
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:029916_0148_0FE30AAB86C9E270"/>
to be found; and now, to ſilence the ſuſpicions that threatened to break out in ſome dreadful acts of violence, involving the whole committee in the ſame deſtruction, he offered to make one of the third deputation; the ſecond appearing to be detained, to remonſtrate with Delaunay, and try to prevent an effuſion of blood. A drum and colours were ordered to attend them, becauſe it was ſuppoſed, that the want of ſome ſignal had prevented the others from executing their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               <p>Shortly after their departure, however, the ſecond deputation returned, and informed the committee, that, in their way to the Baſtile, they had met a wounded citizen, carried by his companions, who informed them, that he had received a ſhot from a fuſil, fired from the Baſtile into the ſtreet St. Antoine; and that immediately after they had been ſtopped by a crowd, who were guarding three invalids, taken firing on their fellow citizens. Judging by theſe events, added they, that the danger was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing, we haſtened our ſteps, animated by the hope of putting a ſtop to ſuch an unequal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Arrived within an hundred paces of the fortreſs, we perceived the ſoldiers on the towers firing upon the ſtreet St. Antoine, and we heard the report of the guns of the citizens in the court, diſcharged on the garriſon. Drawing nearer, we made ſeveral ſignals to the governor, which were either unobſerved, or diſregarded. We then approached the gate, and ſaw the people, almoſt all without any thing to defend themſelves, ruſhing forward expoſed to the briſk fire of artillery, that hailed directly down upon them,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:029916_0149_0FE30A12197FDCD0"/>
making great havoc. We prevailed on thoſe who had arms, to ſtop firing for a moment, whilſt we reiterated our ſignal of peace; but the garriſon, regardleſs of it, continued their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges, and we had the grief to ſee fall, by our ſides, ſeveral of the people, whoſe hands we had ſtopped. The courage of the reſt, again in flamed by indignation, puſhed them forward.—Our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances, our prayers, had no longer any effect; and they declared, that it was not a deputation they now wiſhed for.—It was the ſiege of the Baſtile—the deſtruction of that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible priſon—the death of the governor, that they demanded, with loud cries. Repulſed by theſe brave citizens, we p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rtook their momentary indignation, ſo fully juſtified by the abominable act of perfidy, with which they charged the governor.—They then repeated the information which has already reached you—that in the morning a crowd having approached the Baſtile to demand arms, the governor had allowed a certain number to enter, and then had fired upon them. Thus the treaſon of the governor had been the firſt ſignal of a war, that he himſelf had begun with his fellow citizens, and ſeemed willing to continue obſtinately, ſince he refuſed to attend to the deputation. Through all parts it was now reſounded.—'Let us take the Baſtile!' —And five pieces of cannon, conducted by this cry, were haſtening to the action.</p>
               <p>Some time after, the third deputation alſo came back, and recounted, that, at the ſight of their white flag, one had been hoiſted on the top of the Baſtile, and the ſoldiers had grounded their arms;—that under the auſpices of theſe enſigns
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:029916_0150_0FE30AAD0B35B0A0"/>
of peace, the deputies had engaged the people, in the name of the permanent committee, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to their diſtricts, and take the meaſures the moſt proper to re-eſtabliſh tranquility—and, that this retreat was actually taking place; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple all naturally paſſing through the court where the deputation remained.—When, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the white emblem of a pacific diſpoſition, diſplayed on the tower, the deputies ſaw a piece of cannon planted directly at the court, and they received a ſudden diſcharge of muſketry, which killed three perſons at their feet—that this atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, at the moment they were calming the people, had thrown them into a tranſport of rage; and many of them had even held their bayonets at the breaſts of the deputies; ſaying,
<q>you are alſo traitors, and have brought us here that we might be more eaſily killed</q>
—and it would have been difficult to calm them, if one of the deputies had not bid them obſerve, that they ſhared the ſame danger. The efferveſcence then abating, they haſtened back and met 300 of the French guards, followed by the cannons taken at the invalids, all marching with a quick ſtep, crying that they were going to take the Baſtile. One of the deputies, who had been ſeparated from the reſt, further recited;—that having been obliged to ſcramble over the dead and dying to eſcape, the people, who recognized him as an elector, deſired him to ſave himſelf—for that the treaſon was manifeſt.
<q>It is rather you, my friends, he replied, who ought to retire; you who hinder our ſoldiers and cannons from entering this encumbered court, where you are all going to periſh, for no purpoſe.</q>
But, that
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:029916_0151_0FE30A25C57AE0B8"/>
they interrupted him in a tranſport, exclaiming—
<q>No!—No! our dead bodies will ſerve to fill up the trench.</q>
He therefore retired with the balls hiſſing about his ears. Theſe recitals, and the rumor of the ſecond act of treachery, ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the city, violently agitated minds already alive to ſuſpicion.</p>
               <p>Freſh crowds continually ruſhed into the <hi>Hôtel-de-Ville,</hi> and again they threatened to ſet fire to it, repeating how many times the mayor had deceived them. And, when he attempted to calm them by making plauſible excuſes, they ſtopped his mouth by ſaying, with one voice,— 'he ſeeks to gain time by making us loſe our's. Two intercepted billets alſo having been read aloud, addreſſed to the principal officers of the Baſtile, deſiring them to ſtand out, and promiſſing ſuccour; increaſed the public fury, principally directed againſt the governor of the Baſtile, the mayor, and even the permanent committee.— Outcry followed outcry, and naked arms were held up denouncing vengeance—when an old man exclaimed, my friends, what do we here with theſe traitors!—Let us march to the Baſtile! at this cry, as at a ſignal of victory, all the people haſtily left the hall, and the committee unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly found themſelves alone.</p>
               <p>In this moment of ſolitude and terror, a man entered with affright viſible on every feature, ſaying, that the ſquare trembled with the rage of the people; and that they had devoted all of them to death.—'Depart!' he exclaimed, running out,
<q>ſave yourſelves while you can—or you are all loſt!</q>
But they remained ſtill; and were not long permitted in ſilence to anticipate the
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:029916_0152_0FE30AAE92690728"/>
approach of danger; for one party of people following another, brought in a number of their wounded companions:—and thoſe who brought them, deſcribed with paſſion the carnage of the citizens ſacrificed under the ramparts of the Baſtile. This carnage, the military officers attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the diſorder of the attack, and to the intrepidity of the aſſailants ſtill greater than the diſorder.</p>
               <p>The accounts of the ſlaughter, nevertheleſs, were certainly very much exaggerated; for the fortreſs appears to have been taken by the force of mind of the multitude, preſſing forward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs of danger. The ardor of the beſiegers, rather than their numbers, threw the garriſon into confuſion; for the Baſtile was juſtly reckoned the ſtrongeſt and moſt terrific priſon in Europe, or perhaps in the world. It was always guarded by a conſiderable number of troops, and the governor had been previouſly prepared for its de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nce; but the unexpected impetuoſity of the Pariſians was ſuch as nothing could withſtand. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that Delaunay, at firſt, deſpiſed the attempt of the people; and was more anxious to ſave from injury or pillage, a ſmall elegant houſe he had built in the outer court, than to avoid flaughter. Afterwards, however, in the madneſs of deſpair, he is ſaid to have rolled down large maſſes of ſtone from the platform on the heads of the people, to have endeavoured to blow up the fortreſs, and even to kill himſelf. The French guards, it is true, who mixed with the multitude, were of eſſential ſervice in ſtorming the Baſtile, by adviſing them to bring the cannon, and take ſome other meaſures, that only military experience
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:029916_0153_0FE309EC78C64188"/>
could have dictated; but the enthuſiaſm of the moment rendered a knowledge of the art of war needleſs; and reſolution, more powerful than all the engines and batteries in the world, made the draw-bridges fall, and the walls give way.</p>
               <p>Whilſt then the people were carrying every thing before them, the committee only thought of preventing the further effuſion of blood. Another deputation was therefore nominated, more numerous than had hitherto been ſent; and they were juſt ſetting out on this errand of peace, when ſome voices announced, that the Baſtile was taken. Little attention, however, was paid to them; and the news was ſo impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the impreſſion made by the rumour was not ſufficiently ſtrong to ſtop the outrages of the mob, who were ſtill menacing the mayor and the committee.—When a freſh uproar, heard at firſt at ſuch a diſtance that it could not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed, whether it was a cry of victory or of alarm, advancing with the craſh and rapidity of a tempeſt, came to confirm the unlooked for intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence.—For the Baſtile was taken!</p>
               <p>At the inſtant even the great hall was inundated by a crowd of all ranks, carrying arms of every kind.—The tumult was inexpreſſible—and to increaſe it, ſome one called out, that the hotel was giving way, under the mingled ſhout of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and treaſon! vengeance and liberty!—About thirty invalids and Swiſs ſoldiers were then drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the hall, whoſe death the multitude imperiouſly demanded.—Hang them! Hang them! was the univerſal roar.</p>
               <p>An officer of the queen's regiment of guards (M. Elie) was brought in on the ſhoulders of the
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:029916_0154_0FE30AB67B868A68"/>
conquerors of the Baſtile, and proclaimed by them, as the firſt of the citizens, who had juſt made themſelves maſters of it. The efforts he uſed to repreſs the teſtimonies of honour, which were laviſhed on him, were of no avail; and he was placed, in ſpite of his modeſty, on a table oppoſite the committee, and ſurrounded by the priſoners, who ſeemed to be ſtanding in fearful expectation of their doom. In this ſituation he was crowned, and trophies of arms awkwardly placed around, to which ſentiment and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances gave dignity. All the plate taken at the Baſtile was brought to him, and his comrades preſſed him, in the moſt earneſt manner, to accept it, as the richeſt ſpoil of the vanquiſhed enemy. But he refuſed with firmneſs, explaining the motives of his refuſal ſo eloquently, he perſuaded all who heard him, that the ſpoil did not belong to them; and that patriotiſm, jealous only of glory and honour, would bluſh at receiving a pecuniary recompence.—And making a noble uſe of the aſcendency which he had over the people, he began to recommend moderation and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency.—But he was ſoon interrupted by the account of the death of Delaunay; ſeized in the court of the Baſtile, and dragged by the furious populace almoſt to the <hi>Hôtel-de-ville,</hi> before he was maſſacred.—And ſoon after the death of three other officers was reported.</p>
               <p>The priſoners liſtened to theſe tales with the countenances of victims ready to be ſacrificed, whilſt the exaſperated crowd demanded their inſtant execution. One of the electors ſpoke in their favour, but was ſcarcely permitted to go on. The people, indeed, were principally enraged
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:029916_0155_0FE30AF4156F59B8"/>
againſt three of the invalids, whom they accuſed of being the cannoneers, that had fired ſo briſkly on the citizens. One of them was wounded, and conſequently inſpired more compaſſion. The marquis de la Salle placed himſelf before this poor wretch, and forcing, in ſome degree, the people to hear him, he inſiſted on the authority which he ought to have as commander in chief; adding, that he only wiſhed to ſecure the culprits, that they might be judged with all the rigour of martial law. The people ſeemed to approve of his reaſoning; and taking advantage of this fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable turn, he made the wounded invalid paſs into another apartment.—But, whilſt he was preſerving the life of this unfortunate man, the mob hurried the other two out of the hall, and immediately hung them on the adjacent lamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt<note n="*" place="bottom">The lamp-poſts, which are only to be found in ſquares, and places where there are not two rows of houſes, are much more ſubſtantial than in England.</note>. The efferveſcence, nevertheleſs, in ſpite of this overflowing of fury, ſtill continued, and was not even damped by theſe cruel acts of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation. Two ſentiments agitated the public mind—the joy of having conquered, and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> deſire of vengeance. Confuſed denunciations of treaſon reſounded on all ſides, and each individual was eager to ſhow his ſagacity in diſcovering a plot, or ſubſtituted ſuſpicion inſtead of conviction with equal obſtinacy. The mayor, however, had given ſufficient proofs of his diſpoſition to ſupport the court, to juſtify the rage which was breaking out againſt him; and a general cry having been raiſed around him, that it was neceſſary for him
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:029916_0156_0FE30AB94E1E8468"/>
to go to the <hi>palais royal,</hi> to be tried by his fellow citizen, he agreed to accompany the people.</p>
               <p>Mean time the clamour againſt the reſt of the invalids redoubled. But the French guards, who entered in groups, requeſted as a recompenſe for the ſervice which they had rendered to their country the pardon of their old comrades; and M. Elie joined in the requeſt; adding, that this favour would be more grateful to his heart, than all the gifts and honours which they wiſhed to laviſh on him. Touched by his eloquence, ſome cried out—Pardon! and the ſame emotion ſpreading throughout the circle—Pardon! Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don! ſucceeded the ferocious demand of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, which had hitherto ſtifled ſympathy. And to aſſure their ſafety, M. Elie propoſed making the priſoners take an oath of fidelity to the nation and the city of Paris; and this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was received with teſtimonies of general ſatisfaction. The oath being adminiſtered, the French guards ſurrounded the priſoners and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them away, in the midſt of them, without meeting with any reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>The committee now endeavoured to re-eſtabliſh ſomething like order, for in the tumult the table had been broken down, and deſtruction menaced on every ſide—when a man entered to inform them, that an unknown, but, indeed, a merciful hand, had ſhot the mayor, and thus by the only poſſible mean ſnatched him from the popular fury. The whole tenor of his conduct, in fact, juſtified the charge brought againſt him, and rendered at leaſt this effect of public indignation excuſable.—So excuſable, that had not the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the people, exaſperated by deſigning
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:029916_0157_0FE30A0E9DB3CA50"/>
men, afterwards been directed to the commiſſion of the moſt barbarous atrocities, the vengeance of this day could hardly be cited as acts of injuſtice or inhumanity.</p>
               <p>The Baſtile was taken about four o'clock in the afternoon; and after the ſtruggle to ſave the priſoners, ſome neceſſary regulations were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, to ſecure the public ſafety. The conduct of the men in office had ſo irritated the people, that the cry againſt ariſtocrats was now raiſed; and a number of perſons of diſtinction were brought to the <hi>Hôtel-de-ville</hi> this evening, by the reſtleſs populace, who, roving abo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Breathleſs with victory, they, for the moment, gave a looſe to joy; but the ſounds of exul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation dying away with the day, night brought back all their former apprehenſions; and they liſtened with freſh affright to the report, that a detachment of troops was preparing to enter one of the barriers. Not, therefore, allowing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſleep on their conquering arms, this was, likewiſe, a watchful night; for the taking of the Baſtile, though it was a proof the courage and reſolution of the Pariſians, by no means ſecured them againſt the inſidious ſchemes of the cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

place of alarm. The pavement of the adjacent ſtreets was torn up with aſtoniſhing quickneſs, and carried to the tops of the houſes; where the women who were equally animated, ſtood prepared to hurl them down on the ſoldiers.— All Paris, in ſhort, was awake; and this vigilance either fruſtrated the deſigns of the cabal, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated the hoſtile force, which never appeared to have entered with earneſtneſs into its meaſures. For it is probable, that ſome deciſive ſtroke had been concerted; but that the officers, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by their preſence only to have terrified into obedience the citizens, whoſe courage, on the contrary, they rouſed, were rendered irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute by the diſaffection of the ſoldiers. Thus was the nation ſaved by the almoſt incredible exertion of an indignant people; who felt, for the firſt time, that they were ſovereign, and that their power was commenſurate to their will. This was certainly a ſplendid example, to prove, that nothing can reſiſt a people determined to live free; and then it appeared clear, that the freedom of France did not depend on a few men, whatev<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="148" facs="unknown:029916_0159_0FE30AF597623C90"/>
preſence of the troops at Verſailles, the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated facts, and the ſuſpected proſcriptions, gave to this ſitting the involuntary emotions, that muſt naturally be produced by the approach of a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe, which was to decide the ſalvation or deſtruction of the ſtate. Mirabeau, firm to his point, ſhewed the neceſſity of inſiſting on the ſending away the troops without delay; and ſoon after the viſcount de Noailles, arriving from Paris, informed them, that the arms had been taken from the <hi>Hôtel-des-invalides;</hi> and that the Baſtile was actually beſieged. The firſt impulſe was for them to go altogether, and endeavour to open the king's eyes; but, after ſome reflection, a numerous deputation was nominated;—to inſiſt on the removal of the troops; and to ſpeak to his majeſty with that energetic frankneſs, ſo much more neceſſary as he was deceived by every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon by whom he was ſurrounded. Whilſt they were abſent, two perſons, ſent by the electors of Paris informed the aſſembly of the taking of the Baſtile, and the other events of the day; which were repeated to them, when they returned with the king's vague anſwer.</p>
               <p>A ſecond deputation was then immediately ſent, to inform him of theſe circumſtances:—To which he replied—
<q>You more and more diſtreſs my heart, by the recitals you bring me of the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Paris. But I cannot believe, that the orders which I have given to the troops, is the cauſe of them: I have, therefore, nothing to add to the anſwer that you have already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This reply tended to increaſe the general alarm; and they determined again to prolong the ſitting
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:029916_0160_0FE30ABC56BE4BD0"/>
all night; either to be ready to receive the enemy in their ſacred function, or to make a laſt effort near the throne to ſuccour the metropolis. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could ſurpaſs the anxious ſuſpenſe of this ſituation; for the moſt reſolute of the deputies were uneaſy reſpecting their fate, becauſe their perſonal ſafety was connected with the ſalvation of France. Their nocturnal converſation na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally turned on the late events that had taken place at Paris; the commotions in the provinces; and the horrors of famine, ready to conſume thoſe whom a civil war ſpared. The old men ſought for an hour of repoſe upon the tables and carpets; the ſick reſted on the benches.—All ſaw the ſword ſuſpended over them, and over their country—and all feared a morrow ſtill more dreadful.</p>
               <p>Impreſſed by their ſituation, and the danger of the ſtate. one of the deputies (the duke de Lian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court) left his poſt and ſought a private audience with the king, with whom he warmly expoſtulated, pointing out the critical ſituation of the kingdom; and even of the royal family, ſhould his majeſty perſiſt to ſupport the preſent meaſures.

himſelf out of the preſent difficulties, by yielding to neceſſity.</p>
               <p>On the morning of the 15th, the national aſſembly, not informed of this circumſtance, reſolved to ſend another remonſtrance to the king;—and Mirabeau, giving a ſketch of the addreſs, drew a rapid and lively picture of the exigencies of the moment. 'Tell him,' ſaid he,
<q>that the hordes of foreigners, by whom we are beſieged, have yeſterday been viſited by the princes and princeſſes, their favourites, and their minions, who, laviſhing on them careſſes and preſents, exhorted them to perſeverance— tell him, that the whole night theſe foreign ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellites, gorged with gold and wine, have, in their impious camp, predicted the ſubjugation of France, and that they invoked, with brutal vehemence, the deſtruction of the national aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly—tell him, that, even in his own palace, the courtiers have mingled in the dance to the ſound of this barbarous muſic—and, tell him, that ſuch was the ſcene, which announced St. Bartholomew.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Tell, him, that the Henry, whoſe memory the world bleſſes, the anceſtor, whom he ought to wiſh to take for a model, allowed proviſion to paſs into Paris in a ſtate of revolt, when he was in perſon beſieging it; whilſt his ferocious counſellors are turning back the flo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The deputation left the hall; but was ſtopped by the duke de Liancourt; who informed them, that that the king was then coming to reſtore

them to tranquillity and peace. Every heart was relieved by this intelligence; and a cynic, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, would have found leſs dignity in the joy, than the grief of the aſſembly. A deputy, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, moderated theſe firſt emotions, by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that thoſe tranſports formed a ſhocking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt with the diſtreſs which the people had already endured.—He added,
<q>that a reſpectful ſilence was the proper reception of a monarch during a moment of public ſorrow: for the ſilence of the people is the only leſſon of kings.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Shortly after, the king appeared in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, ſtanding uncovered; and without any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to ceremony. He addreſſed the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people with artful affection: for as it is impoſſible to avoid comparing his preſent affectionate ſtyle, with the cold contempt with which he anſwered their repeated remonſtrances the preceding evening, it is not judging harſhly to deſpiſe the affectation, and to ſuggeſt, that it was dictated rather by ſelfiſh prudence than by a ſenſe of juſtice, or a feeling of humanity. He lamented the diſorder that reigned in the capital, and requeſted them to think of ſome method to bring back order and tranquillity. He alluded to the report, that the perſonal ſafety of the deputies had been menaced; and, with contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble duplicity aſked, if his well-known character did not give the lie to ſuch a rumour.—Reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then, he concluded, on the love and fidelity of his ſubjects, he had given orders to the troops to repair to more diſtant quarters—and he au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized, nay, invited them, to make known his intentions to the metropolis.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="unknown:029916_0163_0FE30AFCB5F18E18"/>This ſpeech was interrupted and followed by the moſt lively expreſſion of applauſe; though the ſagacity of a number of the deputies <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The declaration of Louis, that, truſting to the repreſentatives of the people, he had ordered the troops to withdraw from Verſailles, being ſpread abroad, every perſon, feeling reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the oppreſſion of fear, and unſhackled from the fetters of deſpotiſm, threw off care; and the national aſſembly immediately appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eighty-four of it's moſt reſpectable members, to convey to Paris the glad intelligence; that the haraſſed Pariſians might participate in the joy they had procured the aſſembly, by the moſt noble exertions.</p>
               <p>Arrived at Paris they were received with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, as the ſaviours of their country; and ſaw there more than a hundred thouſand men in arms, formed into companies; ſhowing the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of a na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The cabinet, indeed, the better to diſguiſe their ſecret machinations, made the king declare, the 23d of June, that
<q>he annulled and diſſolved all powers and reſtrictions, which by cramping the liberty of the deputies would hinder them either from adopting the form of deliberation by orders ſeparately, or in common, by the diſtinct vioce of the three orders,</q>
abſolutely gave his ſanction for conſtituting the national aſſembly one and indiviſible.—And in the ſame declaration, article the 6th, he ſays,
<q>that he will not ſuffer the <hi>cahiers,</hi> or mandates, to be regarded as dictatorial; for they were only to be conſidered as ſimple inſtructions, intruſted to the conſcience and free opinion of the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, who have been choſen.</q>
This was giving them unbounded latitude for their actions.—This was not only a tacit conſent to their proceedings; but it was granting them all his authority to frame a conſtitution.—It was legalizing their actions, even according to the arbitrary rules of the old deſpotiſm; and abroga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſovereign, were now ſufficiently enlightened, to demand a reſtitution of their long-eſtranged rights;—and a conſtitution, upon which they could conſolidate their liberty and national fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity.</p>
               <p>This imperious demand was irreſiſtible; and the cabinet, unable to check the current of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, had recourſe to thoſe ſtratagems, which, leading to their ruin, has buried in the wreck all that vain grandeur elevated on the ſpoil of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, whilſt it's gilding obſcured the ſad objects of miſery that pined under it's ſhade. Lively ſanguine minds, diſguſted with the vices and artificial manners produced by the great inequality of conditions in France, naturally hailed the dawn of a new day, when the Baſtile was deſtroyed; and freedom, like a lion rouſed from his lair, roſe with dignity, and calmly ſhook herſelf.— With delight they marked her noble pace, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ever ſuppoſing that the tiger, who thirſts for blood, and the whole brutal herd, muſt neceſſarily unite againſt her.—Yet this has been the caſe; the dogs of war have been let looſe, and corruption has ſwarmed with noxious life.—But let not the coldly wiſe exult, that their heads were not led aſtray by their hearts; or imagine, that the improvement of the times does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>token a change of government, gradually taking place to meliorate the fate of man; for in ſpite of the perverſe conduct of beings ſpoiled by the old ſyſtem, the preponderancy of truth has ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered principles in ſome reſpects triumphant over man; and inſtruments of miſchief have won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the good which they have unwittingly produced.</p>

He appears to have ſometimes miſtruſted the cabal; yet, with that mixture of facility and obſtinacy in his character, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of indolence of mind, he allowed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be governed without attempting to form any principle of action to regulate his conduct. For if he had ever really deſired to be uſeful to his people, and to lighten their accumulated burdens, as has been continually inſiſted, he was aſtoniſhingly defective in judgment not to ſee, that he was ſurrounded with ſycophants, who fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened on their hearts blood, uſing his own hand to brand his name with infamy. It may poſſibly be urged in reply, that this yielding temper was a proof of the king's benign deſire to promote the felicity of his ſubjects, and prevent the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of anarchy. To confute ſuch remarks, it is only neceſſary to ſtate, that the preparations which had been made to diſſolve the national aſſembly, and to reduce the people to entire ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, if they were not his immediate contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, muſt have had his ſanction, to give them efficiency; and that the tergiverſation, which he employed on this occaſion, was ſufficient to make <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

capriciouſneſs of conduct throughout the empire. Perhaps, it is vain to expect, that a depraved nation, whatever examples of heroiſm, and noble inſtances of diſintereſted conduct, it may exhibit on ſudden emergencies, or at the firſt ſtatement of an uſeful reform, will ever purſue with ſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the great objects of public good, in the direct path of virtuous ambition.</p>
               <p>If the calamities, however, which have follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in France the taking of the Baſtile, (a noble effort,) be attributed partly to ignorance, or only to want of morals, the evils are in no degree leſſened; neither does it juſtify the conduct of the virulent oppoſers of thoſe manly exertions inſpired by the voice of reaſon.

               <p>And we ought not to be diſcouraged from attempting this ſimplification, becauſe no country has yet been able to do it; ſince it ſeems clear, that manners and government have been in a continual and progreſſive ſtate of improvement, and that the extenſion of knowledge, a truth capable of demonſtration, was never at any period ſo general as at preſent.</p>
               <p>If at one epocha of civilization we know, that all the improvements which were made in arts and ſciences were ſuddenly overturned, both in Greece and Rome, we need not inquire, why ſuperficial reaſoners have been induced to think, that there is only a certain degree of civilization to which men are capable of attaining, without receding back to a ſtate of barbariſm, by the horrid conſequences of anarchy; though it may be neceſſary to obſerve, that the cauſes which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced that event can never have the ſame effect again:—becauſe a degree of knowledge has been

diffuſed through ſociety by the invention of print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which no inundation of barbarians can era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate. Beſides, the improvement of governments do not now depend on the genius of particular men; but on the impetus given to the whole ſociety by the diſcovery of uſeful truths. The oppoſers then of popular governments may tell us, if they pleaſe, that Themiſtocles had no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in ſaving his country, but to gratify his ambition; that Cicero was vain, and Brutus only envious of the growing greatneſs of Caeſar. —Or, to approach our own times;— that if the ſupercilious Wedderburne had not offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an indignity to Franklin, he never would have become an advocate for American indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; and that, if, Mirabeau had not ſuffered in priſon, he never would have written againſt the <hi>lettres de cachet,</hi> or eſpouſed the cauſe of the people.—All of which aſſertions I am willing to admit, becauſe they exactly prove what I wiſh to enforce; namely, that—though bad morals, and worſe laws, have helped to deprave the paſſions of men to ſuch a degree, as to make the benefits which ſociety have derived from the talents or exertions of individuals to ariſe fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To what purpoſe then do ſemi-philoſophers exult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſhow, that the vices of one country are not the vices of another; as if this would prove, that morality has no ſolid foundation; when all their examples are taken from nations juſt emerg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of barbariſm, regulating ſociety on the narrow ſcale of opinions ſuggeſted by their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and the neceſſity of the moment? What, indeed, do theſe examples prove? Unleſs they be allowed to ſubſtantiate my obſervation, that civilization has hitherto been only a perfection of the arts; and a partial melioration of manners, tending more to embelliſh the ſuperior rank of ſociety, than to improve the ſituation of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Sentiments were often noble, ſympathies juſt—yet the life of moſt men of the firſt claſs was made up of a ſeries of unjuſt acts, becauſe the regulations thought expedient to cement ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, did violence to natural juſtice. Venerable as age has rendered many of theſe regulations, cold ſubſtitutes for moral principles, it would be a kind of ſacrilege not to ſtrip them of their gothic veſts. And where then will be found the man who will ſimply ſay—that a king can do no wrong; and that, committing the vileſt crimes to ſully his mind, his perſon ſtill remains ſacred?

               <p>And that a civilization founded on reaſon and morality is, in fact, taking place in the world, will appear clear to all thoſe, who have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the atrocious vices and gigantic crimes, that ſullied the poliſh of ancient manners.

And even the jargon of crude ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, now introduced into converſation, ſhows to what ſide leans vanity, the true thermometer of the times.—An affectation of humanity is the affectation of the day; and men almoſt always affect to poſſeſs the virtue, or quality, that is riſing into eſtimation.</p>
               <p>Formerly a man was ſafe only in one civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized patch of the globe, and even there his life hung by a thread. Such were the ſudden vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes, which, keeping the apprehenſion on the ſtretch, warmed the imagination, that clouded the intellect. At preſent a man may reaſonably expect to be allowed tranquilly to follow any ſcientific purſuit; and when the underſtanding is calmly employed, the heart imperceptibly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes indulgent. It is not the ſame with the cultivation of the arts. Artiſts have commonly irritable tempers; and, inflaming their paſſions as they warm their fancy, they are, generally ſpeaking, licentious; acquiring the manners their productions tend to ſpread abroad, when taſte, only the refinement of weakened ſenſations, ſtifles manly ardour.</p>

the ſtate of ſociety ſlowly meliorating itſelf till the ſeventeenth century, nature ſeemed as much deſpiſed in the arts as reaſon in the ſciences. The different profeſſions were much more knaviſh than at preſent, under the veil of ſolemn ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. Every kind of learning, as in the ſavage ſtate, conſiſted chiefly in the art of tricking the vulgar, by impreſſing them with an opinion of powers, that did not exiſt in nature—The prieſt was to ſave their ſouls without morality; the phyſician to heal their bodies without medicine; and juſtice was to be adminiſtered by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate interpoſition of heaven:—all was to be done by a charm. Nothing, in ſhort, was founded on philoſophical principles; and the amuſements being barbarous, the manners became formal and ferocious. The cultivation of the mind, indeed, conſiſted rather in acquiring languages, and load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the memory with facts, than in exerciſing the judgment; conſequently reaſon governed neither law, nor legiſlation; and literature was equally devoid of taſte. The people were, ſtrictly ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſlaves; bound by feudal tenures, and ſtill more oppreſſive eccleſiaſtical reſtraints; the lord of the domain leading them to ſlaughter, like flocks of ſheep; and the ghoſtly father drawing the bread out of their mouths by the idleſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The croiſades, however, freed many of the vaſſals; and the reformation, forcing the clergy to take a new ſtand, and become more moral, and even wiſer, produced a change of opinion, that ſoon appeared in humanizing the manners, though not in improving the different governments.</p>

This ſingular felicity was not more owing to the inſular ſituation of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, than to their ſpirited efforts; and national proſperity was the reward of their exertions. Whilſt, therefore, Engliſhmen were the only free people in exiſtence, they appear to have been not only content, but charmed with their conſtitution; though perpetually complaining of the abuſes of their government. It was then very natural, in ſuch an elevated ſituation, for them to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate with graceful pride their comparative hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; and taking for granted, that it was the model of perfection, they never ſeem to have formed an idea of a ſyſtem more ſimple, or better calculated to promote and maintain the freedom of mankind.</p>
               <p>That ſyſtem, ſo ingenious in theory, they thought the moſt perfect the human mind was capable of conceiving; and their contentions for its ſupport contributed more to perſuade them, that they actually poſſeſſed an extenſive liberty, and the beſt of all poſſible governments, than to ſecure the real poſſeſſion. However, if it had no ſpecific baſis beſide magna charta, till the habeas corpus act paſſed; or before the revolution of 1688, but the temper of men; it is a ſufficient demonſtration, that it was a government reſting on principles emanating from the conſent, if not from the ſenſe of the nation.</p>

               <p>THE preſence of the deputies had diffuſed throughout the capital the moſt intoxicating joy —for where is joy expreſſed with ſuch infantile playfulneſs, ſuch entire forgetfulneſs of to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, as at Paris? and the citizens, with their uſual burſt of gratitude, which always reſembles adoration, made choice of Baillie, the firſt acting preſident of the national aſſembly, for mayor,

and of La Fayette for commander in chief of the national guards: the name now given to the <hi>garde-bourgeoiſe,</hi> and the other ſoldiers incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with them. But the rapture of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſians, as tranſient as lively, dwindled, as their ſpirits were exhauſted, into the murmurs of ſuſpicion.—The miniſtry, ſaid they, who were choſen to depreſs us, are not yet diſmiſſed; and the troops, that were to have been their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of miſchief, ſtill hov<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A rumour was ſpread, that a convoy of flour had been intercepted by the order of the miniſters, in its way to Paris; and ſome diſturbances at the Baſtile had given colour to a report, that they had attempted to make themſelves once more maſters of this important fortreſs. The night of the 15th was then another devoted to watchfulneſs and anxiety; and in the morning a deputation was ſent to the national aſſembly, praying them to demand the diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the preſent miniſtry, and the recal of Necker.</p>
               <p>The aſſembly took the ſubject into delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This rouſed the genius of Mirabeau; and the bubbles of fear, and the ſtraw-like objections of timidity, were carried away by the torrent of his eloquence. The diſcuſſion grew warm; yet for the preſent occaſion ſoon became of little importance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the miniſtry, finding that they could not ſtand the brunt of the ſtorm, reſigned; Necker alſo, in whom the public had ſtill the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit

confidence, was invited to return;—and the king appearing to be anxious to give every proof of his deſire to eſtabliſh general tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſignified, that he wiſhed to viſit Paris. A ſhort time after they were officially informed that the troops were promptly removing to more diſtant quarters. The national aſſembly accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſent ſome of their members to communicate to the Pariſians this welcome intelligence, to prepare for the reception of the king by calming the fears of the people.</p>
               <p>And he, adhering to his purpoſe, left Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles the next day (the 17th), though his family ridiculouſly endeavoured to diſſuade him; inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating, that he ought not to truſt his ſacred perſon to the mercy of an enraged multitude; whilſt rumours of projected aſſaſſinations were repeated befor him, with exaggerated com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But, being a man of conſiderable animal courage, and now almoſt perceiving, that all the evils with which he was ſtruggling had been produced by his headſtrong adviſers, he ſeemed determined, at leaſt for the preſent, not to be governed by their dangerous councils. And he had even the ſagacity to foreſee, that, convulſed as the kingdom was, they would occaſion a civil war, and his life might then be ſtill more expoſed. In this inſtance, as we ſhall find in many others, Louis appears to have been directed by a kind of glimmering inſtinct of propriety; for at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent juncture it was particularly diſcreet, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the little effect the pageantry of the court had produced at the <hi>Séance-royale,</hi> to meet the people without the parade of robes or guards. And, in fact, the hundred deputies who followed

him, were now the only retinue that would have appeared reſpectable in the eyes of the people What too muſt have been his ſurpriſe, in ſpite of all he had heard, to paſs through an immenſe avenue of armed Pariſians with ſuch a new aſpect. —Till now he had always ſeen a timid multitude flying before the watch, giving vent to their vengeance in vain ſongs, and to their grief in feeble murmurs:—to-day he ſaw them trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant, moving orderly along, calling out on every ſide, during the proceſſion, for a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and laws! marching in uniſon with their reflections, they advanced, but ſlowly; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt afraid to hope, they proceeded with the meaſured ſtep of thought, or rather ſadneſs; and the people, whoſe mind was ſtill agitated, as the ſwell of the ſea continues after the ſtorm has ſubſided, uttered not the ſhout of gladneſs— <hi>vive-la-roi;</hi>—but the menacing memento—<hi>vive-la-nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was as ominous a ſound, as the woe! woe! reſounding through the ſilent ſtreets of a beſieged city—for it was equally the voice of fate, proclaiming the will of the people, diſguſted with courts, and ſuſpicious even of the king. Louis ſeems to have been forcibly ſtruck by the energy every where diſplayed; and not more by the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent diſcourſes addreſſed to him at the Hôtel-de-ville, than by the countenance of each citizen: for the fire of liberty had already lighted up in every face the ſerene luſtre of manly firmneſs.— So impreſſed, indeed, was his mind by the whole ſc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

taking the national cockade from the hands of the mayor, he appeared at the window with his heart in his eyes, as if eager to convince the multitude of his ſincerity: and perhaps conſcious, that, firſt ſubmitting to neceſſity, he now yielded to feeling. At theſe words, the repetition of which flew like lightning from rank to rank, the whole concourſe, of people caught the electrical ſympathy.—<hi>Vive-le-roi</hi> was ſhouted from every quarter; and revived affection glowed with the freſh fervour, that effaces the remembrance of doubts, and makes the fear of having been unjuſt, the moſt powerful ſpring of tenderneſs.

               <p>Pleaſure, now almoſt mounting to a feveriſh height, ſet all Paris quickly in motion; and the ſound of the thundering artillery was the ſwift harbinger of the tidings of reconciliation to Verſailles, where the royal family muſt have been anxiouſly alive to the events of the day.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſudden tranſitions from one extreme to another, without leaving any ſettled conviction behind, to confirm or eradicate the corroding diſtruſt, could not be ſeen in ſuch a ſtrong light any where as at Paris, becauſe there a variety of cauſes have ſo effeminated reaſon, that the French may be conſidered as a nation of women; and made feeble, probably, by the ſame combination of circumſtances, as has rendered theſe inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. More ingenious than profound in their reſearches; more tender than impaſſioned in their
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:029916_0192_0FE30B198BED5458"/>
affections; prompt to act, yet ſoon weary; they ſeem to work only to eſcape from work, and to reflect merely how they ſhall avoid reflection. Indolently reſtleſs, they make the elegant furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their rooms, like their houſes, voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly handy. Every thing, in ſhort, ſhows the dexterity of the people, and their attention to preſent enjoyment.</p>
               <p>And ſo paſſive appears to be their imagination, it requires to be rouſed by novelty; and then, more lively than ſtrong, the evaneſcent emotions ſcarcely leave any traces behind them. From being devoted to pleaſure in their youth, old age is commonly paſſed in ſuch merely animal grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, that a reſpectable looking aged man or woman is very rarely to be ſeen. Independent, likewiſe, of the vanity which makes them wiſh to appear polite, at the very moment they are ridiculing a perſon, their great ſuſceptibility of diſpoſition leads them to take an intereſt in all the ſenſations of others, which are forgotten almoſt as ſoon as felt. And theſe tranſient guſts of feeling prevent their forming thoſe firm reſolves of reaſon, that bracing the nerves, when the heart is moved, make ſympathy yield to principles, and the mind triumph over the ſenſes.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the climate of France is ſo genial, and the blood mounted ſo checrily in the veins, even of the oppreſſed common people, that, living for the day, they continually baſked in the ſunſhine, which broke from behind the heavy clouds that hung over them.</p>
               <p>It is impoſſible, after tracing the horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy formed by the court againſt the lives and
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:029916_0193_0FE30AF291B67838"/>
liberty of the people, not to feel the moſt ineffa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble contempt for that kind of government, which leaves the happineſs of a nation at the mercy of a capricious miniſter of ſtate. The awful and intereſting leſſon, which the developement of this treachery afforded, was ſuch as ought to have made an indelible impreſſion on their minds.—It was a leſſon, the very thought of which ſtops for a moment the genial current of the heart.—It was a leſſon, that ſhould be repeated to mankind; to bring home to their very ſenſes a conviction of the lengths to which a depraved and abſolute government will go, for the ſake of holding faſt it's power.—It was, in ſhort, a deduction of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which will teach poſterity that life, and every thing dear to man, can be ſecured only by the preſervation of liberty.</p>
               <p>The want of deciſion in the character of Louis ſeems to have been the foundation of all his faults, as well as of all his misfortunes; and every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment freſh occaſions to make the obſervation ariſe as we trace his miſconduct, or compaſſionate his ſituation.</p>
               <p>To give a ſtriking inſtance, it is only neceſſary to turn our attention to the fatal effects that flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his conſenting to aſſemble an army of foreigners, to intimidate the ſtates-general. He could not reſiſt the court, who counſelled this meaſure; or ſilence the miſgivings of his heart, which made him averſe to the troops taking any deciſive ſtep, that lead to ſlaughter. And ſtill governed by theſe undiſciplined feelings, when he diſmiſſed the army he purſued the advice of the very cabal, that had led him into this error; giving way to the wiſhes of the people,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:029916_0194_0FE30B458BB4B828"/>
yet diſſembling with them even in the act of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation. Thus, for ever wavering, it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to mark any fixed purpoſe in his actions; excepting that which does him honour—the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to prevent the ſhedding of blood. This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple has, in general, directed his conduct; though the ſhort-ſighted meaſures of timid hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, devoid of ſtrength of mind, turned all his efforts to a very contrary effect.</p>
               <p>From the preſence of theſe troops, and their abortive attempt to cruſh liberty in the egg, the ſhell was prematurely broken, and the enthuſiaſm of Frenchmen excited before their judgment was in any conſiderable degree formed. Intoxicated by conqueſt, each began to deſcant on the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abuſes, to ſhow his own cleverneſs in point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the remedy; and arms being once in the hands of the people, it was difficult to perſuade them to give them up for the occupations of peace. It is true, had the national aſſembly been allowed quietly to have made ſome reforms, paving the way for more, the Baſtile, though tottering on its dungeons, might yet have ſtood erect.—And, if it had, the ſum of human miſery could ſcarcely have been increaſed. For the <hi>guillotinc</hi> not find-it's way to the ſplendid ſquare it has polluted, ſtreams of incocent blood would not have flowed, to obliterate the remembrance of falſe impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and drown the groans of ſolitary grief in the loud cry of agony—when, the thread of life is quickly cut in twain, the quivering light of hope i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

frame, or diſturbs the reaſon: yet, who can eſtimate the ſum of comfort blaſted; or tell how many ſurvivors pine, the prey of an imagination diſtracted by ſorrow?</p>
               <p>The character of the French, indeed, had been ſo depraved by the inveterate deſpotiſm of ages, that even amidſt the heroiſm which diſtinguiſhed the taking of the Baſtile, we are forced to ſee that ſuſpicious temper, and that vain ambition of dazzling, which have generated all the ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing follies and crimes. For, even in the moſt public-ſpirited actions, celebrity ſeems to have been the ſpur, and the glory, rather than the happineſs of Frenchmen, the end.—This obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation enforces the grand truth on mankind, that without morality there can be no great ſtrength of underſtanding, or real dignity of conduct. The morals of the whole nation were deſtroyed by the manners formed by the government.— Pleaſure had been purſued, to fill up the void of rational employment; and fraud combined with ſervility to debaſe the character;—ſo that, when they changed their ſyſtem, liberty, as it was called, was only the acme of tyranny—merely with this difference, that, all the force of nature being rouſed, the magnitude of the evil promiſed, by ſome mighty concuſſion, to effect it's own cure.</p>
               <p>The reunion of the king and people not only routed, but terrified, the cabal; and as cowardly in adverſity, as preſumptuous in proſperity, they immediately took to flight different ways, and even diſguiſed. One man, who had long been obnoxious to the people on account of inordinate covetouſneſs, and vulgar tyranny, not ſoftened
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:029916_0196_0FE30B4E41ABA490"/>
by the graceful condeſcenſion of the nobility, cauſed it to be reported, that he was dead. The renowned mareſchal Broglio ſought an aſylum at Luxemburgh, whilſt madame Polignac fled to Baſle. Thus went into exile an amiable woman, who had been the inſtrument of the ambition of a family, that rapaciouſly availed themſelves of her great favour with the queen, whoſe ſtrange predilection for handſome women blight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the reputation of every one, whom ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>The count d'Artois, with ſeveral others of the blood royal and principal nobility, likewiſe thought it prudent to leave the kingdom for the preſent; either to provide for their ſafety, or to ſeek vengeance. At Bruſſels they met the unquiet Calonne, who, having heard of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Necker, was lured back by the firſt glimpſe of hope. For wiſhing to wipe away the indignity, which he had ſo impatiently brooked; and fondly believing, that the army had had ſufficient time to quaſh the verbal diſputes of the nation; he was haſtening towards France, to be ready to come in for his ſhare of the triumph.</p>
               <p>To his country this meeting has proved a ſource of evil, that could only have been hatched in ſuch an unprincipled brain, fertile in plans of miſchief, and prone to puzzle the cauſe which he wanted force to ſubvert. His laſt effort for power had been to obtain a ſeat in the ſtates-general And, had not the remembrance of his former adminiſtration ſtood in his way, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable he would have ſucceeded, and there have become a flaming patriot, could he have been the leader of a party; for he poſſeſſed the ſhowy

talents neceſſary to procure inſtantaneous ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe in a popular aſſembly—a deceiving, rather than a commanding eloquence. Mirabeau, on the contrary, ſeems to have had from nature a ſtrong perception of a dignified propriety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; and truth appearing to give earneſtneſs to his arguments, his hearers were compelled to agree with him out of reſpect to themſelves. Leaving then plauſibility far behind, he always ſtood forth as the ſturdy champion of reaſon; even when, laying down his club, he loitered to dally with the imagination. Whilſt therefore Mirabeau was teaching the national aſſembly dignity<note n="*" place="bottom">Mirabeau appears to have been continually hurt by the want of dignity in the aſſembly.—By the inconſiſtency, which made them ſtalk as heroes one moment, with a true theatrical ſtride, and the next cringe with the flexible backs of habitual ſlaves.</note>, the reſentment of the vain-glorious Calonne, ſharpened to the keeneſt edge by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, made him ſuggeſt to thoſe creſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen princes, the neceſſity of engaging foreign aid, to reinſtate the king in his former plenitude of power, and to heal their wounded pride. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, the plauſibility of his manners, and the ingenuity of his arguments, awakened their fears, and nouriſhed their prejudices; and quickly perſuaded to aſſert what they wiſhed to believe, they proteſted againſt the conduct of the national aſſembly; inſinuating, that the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple did not ſupport their pretenſions. The delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, however, did not reſt here; for he even convinced them, that, if the appeal made to the national honour of the French did not recal crowds to their chivalrous allegiance, it would

               <p>Such are the oppoſite ſentiments, or rather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of court paraſites, and men ſtruggling to be free, that it is ſufficient to contraſt them. The deputies, whoſe lives had been threatened, and their perſons groſsly inſulted, not only excuſed the ill adviſed monarch for the countenance which he had given to the violation of the moſt ſacred principles; but expreſſed a conciliatory diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all parties. The mob, it is true, in the heat of rage, inhumanly butchered two of the vile inſtruments of deſpotiſm. But this violence offered to juſtice ought not to be attributed to the temper of the people, much leſs to the connivance of the national aſſembly, who acted with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of magnanimity, at this time, of which it can never be enough lamented that they have ſince loſt ſight.

               <p>The king's eldeſt brother alone remained with the court, a man with more reſources of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in himſelf, than the reſt of his family; yet, making it a point of honour to be treated like his younger brother the count d'Artois, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed by his rapacity to drain the royal trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, though ſuch an expenſive variety of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments was not neceſſary to give a zeſt to his pleaſures.</p>

dye revived by remorſe in the conſcience, can never be rubbed out—why dwell circumſtantially on the exceſſes that revolt humanity, and dim the luſtre of the picture, on which the eye has gazed with rapture, often obliged to look up to heaven to forget the miſery endured on earth? Since, however, we cannot 'out the damned ſpot,' it becomes neceſſary to obſerve, that, whilſt deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm and ſuperſtition exiſt, the convulſions, which the regeneration of man occaſions, will always bring forward the vices they have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendered, to devour their parents.</p>

Ought we then to won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that this dry ſubſtitute for humanity is often burnt up by the ſcorching flame of revenge?

<q>But, if the anger of the people be terrible,</q>
exclaims Mirabeau,
<q>it is the ſang froid of deſpotiſm, that is atrocious; thoſe ſyſtematic cruelties, which have made more wretches in a day than the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular inſurrections have immolated in a courſe of years<note n="*" place="bottom">'Let us compare,' he further adds,

Added to the account of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy to diſſolve the ſtates-general, and maſſacre their repreſentatives, a number of idle rumours of preſent danger tended to make the country people not only eager to guard againſt they ſcarcely knew what, but alſo deſirous to enter into the adventures, and ſhare the honours of the Pariſians.</p>

But, in the country, indeed, men rarely commit ſuch crimes, as lift up their reptile heads in the capital, where the rank atmoſphere affords the noxious particles neceſſary to give virulence to the poiſon.

               <p>THE duke of Liancourt, whoſe warning voice had made the king look around him, when danger was at his heels, was now choſen preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. At this moment the obſtacles, which at
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:029916_0203_0FE30B99A601B4B0"/>
firſt clogged the exertions of the aſſembly, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been overcome: ſtill freſh ones ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up threw a damp on their exultation; and the apprehenſions of a famine, real or facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, were not the leaſt alarming, though the moſt frequent.</p>
               <p>New conſpiracies were already formed on the borders of France, by the princes, and thoſe who had ſubſiſted by the corruptions of the old ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. But this only proved a ſtimulus: becauſe the nation, being determined to ſecure the rights it had ſo ſuddenly regained, raiſed new regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in every part of the country, and was ſoon in a ſituation to repel any attack, which it was poſſible for all Germany to have made; the only quarter from which the fugitive princes, at that period, could expect aſſiſtance. So rapid was the ſpirit, ſo general the momentum, that in the courſe of a week upwards of three mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of men in arms were formed into companies by a common intereſt reſembling an electrical ſympathy. Such was the quick ſucceſſion of events—Such the unanimous ſenſe of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſuch the formidable force which inſtantly oppoſed itſelf to the impotent threats of departing deſpotiſm. Hiſtory will record this memorable era, when the diſciplined forces of the moſt puiſſant tyranny vaniſhed before the force of truth, though ſtill but half unveiled; obliging the haughty ſycophants to ſearch for ſhelter in the receſſes of a foreſt, whither they ſtole under cover of the night from the preſence of an injured people.</p>
               <p>The conduct of the <hi>garde bourgeoiſe,</hi> during the progreſs of the revolution, without varniſhing
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:029916_0204_0FE30B5B159F81D8"/>
over the exceſſes produced by ebullitions of zeal, is of itſelf ſufficient to prove, that a national mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia ſhould every where take place of ſtanding armies, did not experience invariably atteſt, that the laws were never reſpected by men, whoſe buſineſs is war, unleſs they are reduced to mere machines by deſpotiſm.</p>
               <p>The old municipal officers, moſtly ſuſpected, becauſe nominated by the friends of the court, were now obliged to give place to committees elected by the common voice. Theſe taking the adminiſtration of public buſineſs into their hands, a new order of things began every where to prevail. Still, however, the diſturbed imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people was filled with plots, to which ſome myſterious and fatal incidents gave life.</p>
               <p>The municipality of Soiſſons informed the national aſſembly, that troops of banditti had cut down the corn before it was ripe, and obliged the villagers to take refuge in the towns. But on further inquiry, it appeared, that this report aroſe from a ſimple quarrel of the peaſants amongſt themſelves, which had alarmed ſome labourers, who flew to the neighbouring town, imagining that they had thouſands of banditti at their heels.</p>
               <p>Paris was alſo diſturbed by an idle rumour of a riot at St. Denis; ſo ſeriouſly affirmed by thoſe, who declared that they had been eye-witneſſes of the violence, that troops and cannon were ſent, but they could find no traces of the diſturbance.</p>
               <p>Another, more ſerious, had exaſperated the people againſt the nobility, and rouſed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the national aſſembly. A noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man

and counſellor of the parliament gave a civic feaſt in his caſtle to the inhabitants of his village; from which, on ſome pretext, he was abſent. All was joy and feſtivity; but in the midſt of the dance of gladneſs, the ſudden exploſion of a mine ſpread around affright and death.—Hearing of this treachery, the people, catching up their ruſtic weapons, firebrands, haſtened to the neighbouring caſtles; ſome of which they burnt, others they demoliſhed by pulling them down.</p>
               <p>The recital of this atrocity produced a great effect in the national aſſembly; and, ſays Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau,
<q>though great aſſemblies are often much too ſuſceptible of theatrical emotions; and this narration was accompanied with circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of which the invention is ſeldom pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed; and though it was alſo atteſted by a public officer; yet the atrocity of the crime gave it an air of improbability.</q>
This wanton act of barbarity, which the hiſtorian alſo would fain believe a monſtrous chimera of heated brains, was, nevertheleſs, as well ſubſtantiated, as ſuch a fact could be; which nothing, but the confeſſion of the guilty party, can render abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely certain, becauſe it ſeems equally fooliſh and barbarous.</p>
               <p>Theſe diſorders, warmly repreſented by Lally Tolendal, determined the aſſembly, on the 23d of July, to publiſh a proclamation, inviting all good citizens to the maintenance of order; and declaring, that to try and puniſh for all crimes of <hi>leze-nation</hi> was the ſole prerogative of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional aſſembly, till, by the conſtitution which it was about to eſtabliſh, a regular tribunal ſhould

But the
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:029916_0208_0FE30B5ECE0E0D90"/>
preſent was not a caſe in point. It was not a clandeſtine ranſacking of all letters, to ſearch for the clue of ſome ſuſpected plot; or like the reading of the correſpondence of a babbling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirator, after the danger was over, whoſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters might contain a liſt of timid accomplices, who would be driven to deſperation by publicity. However, the decided turn was given to the queſtion by the biſhop of Langres obſerving, that all ages had applauded the generoſity of Pompey, who committed to the flames the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which the ſenators had addreſſed to Serto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. The mania of imitating the Romans on this began to appear, producing one of thoſe inſtances of falſe magnanimity, that always ariſe from imitation: yet ſo trifling, indeed, in its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conſequence, that it would ſcarcely deſerve to be ridiculed, much leſs cenſured, had not the ſame affectation afterwards brought forth more ſerious and even fatal follies.</p>
               <p>The temper alſo of the Pariſians, who mix in the world very early in life, leads them to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that they have acquired the profound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſprings of human paſſions, which enables a ſagacious man almoſt to foreſee future events, only becauſe they have often detected the weakneſſes of the human heart. This made them now ſuppoſe, that the court of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was about to profit by their inteſtine trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. The phraſeology had long been in both countries, that they were the natural enemies of each other; and the miſtruſtful French quickly imagined, that the Engliſh meant immediately to take vengeance for their interference in favour of the Americans, by ſeizing ſome of their Weſt-India

iſlands. The Duke of Dorſet, in his juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of England, only changed the object of miſtruſt, by giving riſe to ſome vague con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures reſpecting a conſpiracy for delivering Breſt into the hands of the Engliſh; and, as there was no clue to lead to the diſcovery of the trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, ſeveral nobles of Britanny, probably inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, were arreſted.</p>
               <p>Theſe were, nevertheleſs, but ſlight impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; for the invigorating voice of the awakened nation gave energy to the aſſembly, who now named committees to expedite the preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, preparatory to their grand taſk of framing a conſtitution.

For the electors pretending to iſſue laws for the whole nation gave great umbrage to the Pariſians, who had winked at the ſtretch of their power, which the preſſing exigency of circumſtances required, during the moment danger menaced the capital. The wild current thus turned, the men, who in the morning had declared,
<q>that liberty was ſafe, ſince Necker was allowed to watch over her,</q>
now accuſed him of ambition, and a deſire to keep well with the court, by facilitating the return, or eſcape of its minions. Such in fact was the inconſtancy of a people, always running after theatrical ſcenes, that the tocſm was rung to denounce Necker as a courtier in one quarter of the city, at the very time the <hi>Palais Royal</hi> was illuminated to celebrate his return as a patriot.</p>
               <p>The buſineſs, however, being referred to the national aſſembly, with a modifying explanation, they decided it mildly, paying the reſpect due to the good intentions from which it proceeded, though they did not pretend to ſanction the haſty reſolve of the electors.</p>

Beſides, the ſudden emancipation of the people occaſioned a delirium of joy, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to be managed with the greateſt delicacy. A vigorous miniſtry was certainly neceſſary to check the licentious ſpirit manifeſting itſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually by the acts of violence, in ſo many parts of the kingdom, where tumults and aſſaſſinations were the effects of the giddineſs of unexpected ſucceſs. Whilſt complaining of the old govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, every man in his ſphere ſeemed to be eager to try how he himſelf could govern, and make up for the time he had delegated his authority. Beſides, the procraſtination of the relief looked for as the immediate conſequence of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however unavoidable, made the people not only murmur, but, diſregarding all reaſon, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to gain more by force than could, for a long time, be granted by juſtice, even had juſtice been unbiaſſed by ſelf-intereſt.</p>
               <p>The nation called for a conſtitution; and the aſſembly debated about the declaration of rights inherent to man, and thoſe he gives up when he becomes a citizen, on which they deſigned to reſt it, as an explanatory ſupport.</p>
               <p>Several members argued, that the declaration ought to conclude, and not precede the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; inſiſting, that it was dangerous to awaken a <hi>ſomnambuliſt</hi> on the brink of a precipice; or to take a man to the top of a mountain, to ſhow him a vaſt country that belonged to him, but of which he could not immediately claim the poſſeſſion. 'It is a veil,' ſaid they,
<q>that it would be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent to raiſe ſuddenly.—It is a ſecret, that it is neceſſary to conceal, till the effect of a

               </p>
               <p>But Bernave terminated the ſitting, though the queſtion was ſtill in debate, by obſerving,
<q>that the declaration of rights was in two reſpects practically uſeful;—firſt, as it fixed the ſpirit of the legiſlation, in order that it might not vary in future; and, ſecondly, as it would direct the repreſentatives of the nation in the formation of laws, in all the details of legiſlation, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of which could only be the work of time. As to the apprehenſion expreſſed of the people abuſing theſe rights, when they acquire a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them, it is,</q>
ſaid he,
<q>futile,—and we need only turn over the page of hiſtory, to loſe theſe vain fears; for we ſhall conſtantly find the people tranquil in the ſame proportion as they are enlightened.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Poizing thus the pillars of equal liberty, the diſcuſſion was the next day interrupted by the report made by the committee appointed for the purpoſe of digeſting the information ſent to the aſſembly, of the melancholy intelligence which they daily received from the provinces.—
<q>The taxes, the rents were no longer paid, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue was exhauſted, the laws were without force; and the ſocial ties almoſt broken.</q>
To remedy ſo many evils, the committee propoſed to the aſſembly to publiſh, as ſoon as poſſible, a ſolemn declaration to teſtify their deep ſenſe of the miſery of the provinces, and their diſapprobation
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:029916_0213_0FE30BA640670318"/>
of the non-payment of taxes and rents; and to declare, that, till the aſſembly had time to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the decrees neceſſary to be paſſed to regulate theſe objects, there did not exiſt any cauſe to juſtify ſimilar refuſals. This propoſition occaſioned a warm debate.</p>
               <p>Some of the deputies repreſented, that the feudal laws were too iniquitous,—the taxes too unequally aſſeſſed—the wretchedneſs too general, to hope for any happy effect from ſuch a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—it would ſoon fall into oblivion, as had done the proclamation for peace:—it would ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravate the miſery of the ſtate, by manifeſting the impotence of the national aſſembly:—it would irritate even the people, who had need of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort; and of whom they could not, without a kind of deriſion, in their preſent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, require the payment of taxes, of which they knew well that each of them felt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice.</p>
               <p>Others did not fail to inſiſt on the danger of letting the diſorder increaſe; on the ſacredneſs of property; and on the immenſe <hi>deficit</hi> with which the nation was menaced; adding, that the national aſſembly would become contemptible, if it did not take the moſt vigorous meaſures.— They further dilated on the neceſſity of re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the authority of the courts of juſtice;— and other arguments of the ſame tendency, which would have been more concluſive, more uſeful, if the ſupporters of the declaration had brought forward the ſhadow of a mode to aſſure it's exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. The debate from being warm became bitter, till it was at length reſolved that a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:029916_0214_0FE30B6052FF6740"/>
ſhould be iſſued for the ſecurity of property, and that the remaining propoſals of the committee ſhould be diſcuſſed the next evening, the 4th of Auguſt.</p>
               <p>But, before they ſeparated, the aſſembly was informed, that Broglio had ordered all the arms, depoſited at the town-houſe of Thionville, to be carried away.—This ſtep appeared to them the height of imprudence, at a moment when the community was obliged to arm itſelf to watch over the public ſafety.</p>
               <p>The following morning it was decided by a great majority, that there ſhould be a declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of rights ſeparate from the conſtitution. The ſitting of the evening was impatiently expected, and the oppoſers of a new proclamation flattered themſelves, that they ſhould ſecure the general ſuffrage by making it appear, that patriotiſm demanded great ſacrifices; and that inſtead of the vain formality of an exhortation, ſoon deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by the people, it was neceſſary to carry real offerings to the altar of peace.—This was the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a ſpeech made by one of the nobles, the viſcount de Noailles; who ſhowed, in a very forcible manner,
<q>that the kingdom, at this moment, fluctuated between the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſaid he,
<q>how are the relaxed ties of ſociety to be ſtrengthened? By calming the people,</q>
he continues,
<q>by letting them ſee, that we are really employed for their good; and that we reſiſt them only where it is manifeſtly
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:029916_0215_0FE30BA8B44A69E0"/>
conducive to their intereſt, that they ſhould be reſiſted.—To attain then this tranquility, ſo neceſſary, I propoſe:</q>
               </p>
               <p n="1">
                  <q>1ſt. That it be declared, before the procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation digeſted by the committee, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of the nation have decided to levy the impoſt, henceforward, in proportion to the income of each individual.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>2dly. That all the public charges ſhall, in future, be equally ſupported by the whole community.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <q>3dly. That all the feudal claims ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemable, on a fair valuation.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="4">
                  <q>4thly. That all the manorial claims, the <hi>mains-mortes,</hi> and other perſonal ſervices, ſhall be done away, without any ranſom.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="5">
                  <q>5thly. That the manorial rents in poultry, and other kinds of proviſion, ſhall be redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the proprietor or contractor, at a juſt valuation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The duke d'Aiguillon ſeconded this motion, which had been warmly applauded; or rather made another tending to the ſame end. For dreading the ſuppreſſion of his penſion, when the <hi>Livre Rouge</hi> ſhould be reviewed, he ſuddenly from being a minion of the old court, became a loud patriot. And further to evince his zeal in the cauſe of liberty, he declared,
<q>that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection found it's excuſe in the vexations to which the people were ſubject. The lords of manors,</q>
he obſerves,
<q>ſeldom commit the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes of which their vaſſals complain; but their agents are often devoid of humanity, and the wretched huſbandmen, ſubject to the barbarous feudal laws ſtill in force, groan under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:029916_0216_0FE30B68EE248BB8"/>
to which they become the victims. At this happy era when united for the public good, and diſengaged from all perſonal intereſt, we are going to labour for the regeneration of the ſtate, it ſeems to me, gentlemen, that it is neceſſary, before eſtabliſhing this conſtitution, ſo deſired by the nation, to prove to all the citizens, that our intention is to eſtabliſh, as ſoon as poſſible, that equality of rights which alone can aſſure their liberty.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It too frequently happens, that men run from one extreme to another, and that deſpair adopts the moſt violent meaſures. The French people had long been groaning under the laſh of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand oppreſſions; they were the hewers of wood and drawers of water for the choſen few. It was, therefore, to be apprehended, after they had once thrown off the yoke, which had imprinted on their character the hateful ſcars of ſervitude, that they would expect the moſt unbridled free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, deteſting all wholeſome reſtraints, as reins they were not now bound to obey. From ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, perhaps, that this was the diſpoſition of the times, the political empirics have continually inflamed the foibles of the multitude, by flattering them. Thus the nobility, whoſe order would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably loſe moſt by the revolution, made the moſt popular motions, to gain favour with the people; tickling the ſpirit they could not tame. Thus alſo we have ſeen the deſperate leaders of factions ſelecting ingeniouſly the terms <hi>ſans-culottes, citoyen,</hi> and <hi>egalité,</hi> in order to cajole the minds of the vulgar; and hence it has happened, that, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as this cajolery was more highly ſeaſoned, the power of ruling has deſcended to the moſt

               <p>The feudal claims that inſult humanity, and ſhow how near man is to the brute creation when laws are firſt made, were afterwards attempted to be enumerated; but a general cry of indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and horror prevented the deputy from finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the frightful picture of human debaſement and brutality.

For a member, that the duke d'Aiguillon ſhould not be generous at the expence of others, propoſed the <hi>immediate</hi> ſuppreſſion of all places and emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments granted ſo profuſely by the court, as the heavieſt burthen of the people—becauſe obliged to ſupport with their neceſſaries the luxuries of the great; who, detained as a kind of guards at court, were not only prevented from enlivening the provinces by their preſence, but diſtreſſed them by drawing away their produce.

               <p>A motion was then made, that not only feudal rights, but all the juriſdiction of the lords of m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The preſident now, according to rule, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that no one attempted to ſpeak againſt the motion, was proceeding to put it to the vo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This artful compliment rouſed the biſhop of Nancy to declare,
<q>that the continual and ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thizing witneſſes of the miſery of the people, the clergy, undoubtedly ſighed after an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to contribute to their relief; and that the motion anticipated their deſire; yet, to ſhow their entire approbation of it, he muſt be permitted to propoſe in addition, that the price of the ranſom of eccleſiaſtical feudalities ſhould not be converted to the profit of the actual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent; but thrown into a fund for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the poorer part of the body.</q>

               <p>The biſhop of Chartres, after approving of the ſacrifices already made, demanded, that the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the game laws ſhould be joined to them.

of the ravages of his harveſt; condemning him to endure cruel puniſhments, if he follow the firſt impulſe of nature, which would lead him to kill the animals that injure him. A number of the nobility concurred in theſe ſentiments; for who would be out-done in heroiſm? and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the renunciations of theſe unnatural privileges.</p>
               <p>The preſident de Saint-Fargeau now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>hopes to the people; but we ought to give them ſomething more ſubſtantial; we have decreed, that, proviſionally, the taxes ſhould continue to be paid as they have been hitherto; that is to ſay, we have reſerved to the clergy and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility the benefit of their exemptions, till they are expreſsly revoked.—Why do we delay to pronounce this revocation, ſo ſtrictly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in almoſt all our inſtructions?—I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, therefore, that not only for the laſt ſix months, but from the very commencement of the year, all privileged perſons, without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, ſupport their proportional part of the public impoſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>As the diſcuſſion of the propoſitions of the viſcount de Noailles advanced, the neceſſity of effacing all the traces of ſervitude became more and more obvious; and all the members ſeemed eager to point out to their colleagues the new ſacrifices, that ought to be made to the good of their country. One demanded the ſuppreſſion of the excluſive right to warrens;—another that

               <p>The pariſh prieſt of Soupes, in the name of his brethern, joined the oblations of the poor to the hecatombs, of which the moſt part coſt nothing to thoſe who propoſed them;
<q>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that, animated by a deſire to contribute to the relief of the people, they would relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh, from the preſent time, all their caſual (or ſurplice) fees.</q>
This offer, made with great ſimplicity of heart, affected the aſſembly; nor could a very different propoſal, made by the duke du Châtelet, reſpecting the buying up of the tithes, efface it entirely.</p>
               <p>The tranſition to gaiety, when a member aſked permiſſion to offer alſo his ſparrow, was very natural in a people, who always mix a degree of ſarcaſtic pleaſantry, the good-humoured face of which firſt appears, with the moſt ſerious things. However, after the laughter ceaſed,—he conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to make his demand more ſeriouſly, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, that an object, trifling in appearance, was a real grievance to the huſbandmen; he moved, therefore, for the total demolition of all the <hi>dove-cotes</hi> throughout the kingdom.</p>
               <p>The reſpectable duke de la Rochefoucault, after having applauded all theſe propoſitions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that the king had given the example of freeing the ſerfs in his demeſnes; and that the moment was come, to extend this benefit to all the kingdom. This benevolent citizen did not ſtop here; but added a wiſh, that, before the cloſe of the ſeſſions, the aſſembly would take into conſideration the fate of the unhappy vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tims

of covetouſneſs, retained in ſlavery under another hemiſphere.</p>
               <p>A member now made a motion, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited teſtimonies of the moſt ſincere ſatisfaction from the aſſembly; it was to augment the ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends of the pariſh prieſts, the moſt reſpectable part of the clergy.</p>
               <p>Several dignitaries of the church, poſſeſſing two or more benefices, unwilling to be left behind in generoſity, followed with a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that, confo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The deputies of the provinces enjoying pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar privileges receiving a hint, that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of French citizens, all partaking the ſame rights, was the moſt glorious they could bear, immediately came forward to renounce them. A number of propoſitions, more or leſs important, brought up the rear. The ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the firſt fruits; the rights of warden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and the abrogation of thoſe barbarous vows, which fetter unfortunate beings for life. —In ſhort, full and entire liberty for the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catholics.—Admiſſion of all the citizens into all offices, eccleſiaſtical, civil, and military.— Abolition of the plurality of eccleſiaſtical pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.—And then, not forgetting their national character, it was propoſed, that a medal ſhould be ſtruck in commemoration of this night <note n="*" place="bottom">Some French wags have laid a great ſtreſs on theſe decrees paſſing after dinner.</note>; and a decree alſo paſſed, conferring gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſly

               <p>It is not poſſible, ſays a journaliſt of the day, to give a diſtinct deſcription of the ſcenes which were continually ſhifting during this ſitting.— The vivacity of the ſentiments, the quick tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from a generous emotion to an epigram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical ſenſation, the diſorder which made ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility predominate over legiſlative dignity— the reciprocal miſtruſt, and the combat of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity—all diverſified by the amiable and ſeducing enthuſiaſm, ſo characteriſtic of the nation, made this an epocha in the hiſtory of the revolution, on which the contemplative mind, accuſtomed to conſider the varied cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of man, will ponder.</p>
               <p>Another obſervation, alſo, naturally occurs; for it is juſt to remark, as a proof of the crudeneſs of the political notions, not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion principles, of theſe legiſlators, that all talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>ſacrifices,</hi> and boaſted of generoſity, when they were only doing common juſtice, and making the obvious practical comment on the declaration of rights, which they had paſſed in the morning. —If ſuch were the rights of man—they were more or leſs than men, who with-held them; and the reſignation, rather a reſumption of their reaſon than a ſacrifice of their property, was called for,
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:029916_0223_0FE30BB46B9BBDF8"/>
the moment they acknowledged the ſovereignty of the people by becoming their repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>It is very poſſible, that the next morning the different parties could ſcarcely believe, that they had more than the imperfect recollection of a dream in their heads. So quick, indeed, had been the determinations of the meeting, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croached on the midnight hour, that they had not the ſober caſt of thought to give them dignity. They ſeem in reality to have been moſtly the effect of paſſion, of ambition, or a vain deſire of vengeance; for thoſe who were led only by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>huſiaſm, and the vanity of the moment, eſteemed their conduct as highly extravagant, when they had time to cool. But the commons, who had the deepeſt views, knew to what they had urged them, and would not let them recede.</p>
               <p>It is true, the abolition of theſe privileges and powers had been ſtrictly enjoined, in the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given to the deputies by their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents: but, it is doubtful, whether they would have been attended to, had not the moſt ſagaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous foreſeen, that the neglect might occaſion a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil war. Knowing, that then property would not be cautiouſly reſpected, they began by attacking that of their preſumptuous adverſaries; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſurpriſed the aſſembly into the unanimous renunciation of all revenues ariſing from feudal dues, and even into the abolition of tithes. The nobility, alſo, who ſaw, that they ſhould gain more by the ſuppreſſion of tithes, than they ſhould loſe by the ſacrifice of the obnoxious mano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial fees, came into the ſame ſyſtem. The ſteps like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe taken to increaſe the ſalaries of the indigent clergy, the moſt numerous part of the body
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:029916_0224_0FE30B75C3E25E98"/>
in the aſſembly, ſecured their influence. And by deſtroying the monopoly of municipal and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial employments, the ſupport of the cities was obtained.—Thus the national aſſembly without a ſtruggle, found itſelf omnipotent. Their only enemies were individuals, ſeemingly of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, it is true, as they had been accuſtomed to lead the great corporate bodies; but what was their empire, when all their former ſubjects were withdrawn from their control? of theſe enemies, the church dignitaries were of the moſt conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; but after the confiſcation of eccleſiaſtical property, it would have been impoſſible for the court, even ſuppoſing a counter-revolution, to provide for them; as they would have been a dead weight on the royaliſts.</p>
               <p>Unfortunately, almoſt every thing human, however beautiful or ſplendid the ſuperſtructure, has, hitherto, been built on the vile foundation of ſelfiſhneſs; virtue has been the watch-word, patriotiſm the trumpet, and glory the banner of enterprize; but pay and plunder have been the real motives. I do not mean to aſſert, that there were not any real patriots in the aſſembly.—I know there were many. By real patriots, I mean men who have ſtudied politics, and whoſe ideas and opinions on the ſubject are reduced to principles; men who make that ſcience ſo much their principal object, as to be willing to give up time, perſonal ſafety, and whatever ſociety com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends in the phraſe, <hi>perſonal intereſt,</hi> to ſecure the adoption of their plans of reform, and the diffuſion of knowledge.</p>
               <p>But moſt of the leaders of the national aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly were guided by the vulgar import of the
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:029916_0225_0FE30B1B10216CD0"/>
word, a vain deſire of applauſe, or deep ſchemes of emolument. The Lameths, for inſtance, who had been the obſequious ſlaves of the queen, were among the hotteſt advocates for popular power; and throughout the aſſembly there were traces of a ſimilar ſpirit.</p>
               <p>During the firſt ſtruggle, the national aſſembly and the people were divided into republicans and royaliſts; but we ſhall find, from the moment all danger of diſturbance appeared to be over, the higher claſs were receding from the patriots, and recruiting from the royaliſts, to form for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the appellation of the <hi>impartiaux,</hi> the elements of a growing ariſtocracy.</p>

               <p>THE deſpotiſm of the former government of France having formed the moſt voluptuous, artificial characters, in the higher orders of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, makes it leſs extraordinary to find the leading patriots men without principles or politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal knowledge, excepting what they had caſually gleaned from books, only read to while away an
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:029916_0226_0FE30B7763D32C50"/>
idle hour not employed in pleaſure. So ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial indeed was their acquaintance with any ſubject that demanded thought—and ſo great the degeneracy of their manners, it was natural for every man of reflection to infer, that a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able length of time muſt elapſe before the new order of things, which they were about to create, could attain ſtability. But this was not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging conſideration, when it was obvious, that important advantages had already been gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the people; and by the improvement of morals, which would neceſſarily follow, it was to be preſumed, that the evils, the old ſyſtem produced, would vaniſh before gradual amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; whilſt, by a practical knowledge of poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and civil liberty, the great objects of the revolution would be aſcertained; namely, juſt laws, and equal liberty.</p>
               <p>The depravity of the higher claſs, and the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the lower reſpecting practical politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſcience, rendered them equally incapable of thinking for themſelves; ſo that the meaſures which flattered the foibles or gratified the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of either, were ſure to have great influence in producing a ſchiſm in the public mind; which gave an opportunity to the enemies of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to impede its courſe. And the number of the lower claſs having its due weight, when they became free, the moſt daring innovators became the greateſt favourites with the public, to whoſe will every prudential conſideration was obliged to yield.</p>
               <p>Much had been gained on the 4th of Auguſt by the nation: the old forms of feudal vaſſalage were completely overturned—and France then
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:029916_0227_0FE2A26C50AF1288"/>
ſtood at the point the moſt advantageous in which a government was ever conſtructed.— She ſtood fair as the dawn of her liberty, having ſhaken off the prejudices of ages; and reaſon was tracing out the road, which leads to virtue, glory, and happineſs—Still ambitious ſelfiſhneſs, melancholy drawback! governed too great a proportion of the aſſembly; and the nobles and clergy who had been averſe to the junction of the orders, now intriguing, every debate became a bitter or violent conteſt, in which the popular advocates continued to gain an aſcendency.</p>
               <p>This diſpoſition to intrigue, and want of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, ſo generally remarked in the French cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, laid the foundation of univerſal diſtruſt; and the coaleſced parties, who had not been actuated by a love of liberty, or regard for the proſperity of the kingdom, but dexterouſly fell in with the ſpirit of the day, were not aware, that a watchful, ſuſpicious multitude, would be as likely to miſtruſt them in their turn, as the court, which had thriven on the ruin of their happineſs. This was a blindneſs ſo groſs, that it appears not a little wonderful, after conſidering the different characters, who ſucceeded each other in the miniſtry, or directed the helm of the ſtate, that men ſhould not acquire ſufficient judgment to adopt the integrity of conduct, with which alone people in their ſenſes, awake to their intereſt and rights, will ever be ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>For a vain glorious ambition, mixing with the abortions of giddy patriotiſm, acts as the moſt fatal poiſon to political diſquiſitions, during ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of public ferment. The ſolid views of deep
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:029916_0228_0FE30B78F3432B40"/>
thinkers are adapted to the ſpirit of the times, and the ſtate of reaſon of their compeers. And if they find that the current of opinion, in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning inveterate prejudices, and the decayed walls of laws, that no longer ſuit the manners, threatens the deſtruction of principles the moſt ſacred; they ought firmly to wait at their poſt, until, the fervor abating, they could, by divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtream, gradually reſtrain it within pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per bounds.—But ſuch patriotiſm is of ſlow growth; requiring both a luxuriant public ſoil, and to be foſtered by virtuous emulation. Yet this emulation will never flouriſh in a country where intriguing fineſſe, ſupplying the place of exalted merit, is the ſureſt ladder to diſtinction. It was by debaſing artifices, under the old go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment that men obtained favour and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence; and while ſuch men, men who were educated and oſſified by the ancient <hi>regimen,</hi> act on the political ſtage of France, mankind will be continually diſtreſſed and amuſed by their tragic and comic exhibitions.</p>
               <p>Art applied to art, and ſtratagem againſt ſtratagem, may produce, for a time, alternate defeats; but ultimately the moſt cunning will triumph.</p>
               <p>Vanity had made every Frenchman a theoriſt, though political aphoriſms were never aſcertained under the reign of tyranny or caprice. The ſagacious part of the nation, it is true, clearly perceived, that the period was arrived, when a revolution was inevitable; but ſelfiſhneſs being incompatible with noble, comprehenſive, or lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable views, it is not wonderful, keeping in ſight
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:029916_0229_0FE30BB60025DF50"/>
the national foible, that at the meeting of the ſtates-general every deputy had his particular plan to ſuggeſt. Few of the leaders embraced the ſame; and acting, without coaleſcing, the moſt violent meaſures were ſure to be the moſt applauded. We ſhall find alſo, that ſome of the moſt ſtrenuous advocates for reforming abuſes, and eſtabliſhing a conſtitution, when their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite ſyſtems were exploded peeviſhly retired in diſguſt: and by afterwards venting it, have hurried into action a race of monſters, the moſt flagitious that ever alarmed the world by the murder of innocents, and the mockery of juſtice; and whilſt the profanation of her temple, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkled with blood, has branded with an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible ſtigma the ſanguinary brutes, the deſerters cannot eſcape without a ſhare of the odium.</p>
               <p>Contemplating the progreſs of the revolution, a melancholy reflection is produced by obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that almoſt every precipitate event has been the conſequence of a tenacity and littleneſs of mind in the political actors, whilſt they were affecting a Roman magnanimity of conduct—to which they appear to have been as great ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, as they were deſtitute of legitimate patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm, and political ſcience.</p>
               <p>We have firſt ſeen Calonne, in order to ſecure his popularity and place, propoſing an equaliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of taxes; and, when he found that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence and power were loſt, abandoning his country in diſguſt, and employing the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable means to involve his fellow citizens in all the horrors of a civil war. We ſhall find, likewiſe ſeveral other declaimers, for their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent conduct obliges me to conſider them in
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:029916_0230_0FE30B7A7581AD78"/>
no better light, when their plans were diſregarded, if not acting the ſame ſhameful part, yet leaving their poſts; their patriotiſm expiring with their popularity.—And it will be only neceſſary to keep in mind the conduct of all the leading men, who have been active in the revolution, to perceive, that the diſaſters of the nation have ariſen from the ſame miſerable ſource of vanity, and the wretched ſtruggles of ſelfiſhneſs; when the criſis required, that all enlightened patriots ſhould have united and formed a band, to have conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidated the great work; the commencement of which they had accelerated. In proportion as theſe deſertions have taken place, the beſt abilities which the country contained have diſappeared. And thus it has happened, that ignorance and audacity have triumphed, merely becauſe there were not found thoſe brilliant talents, which, purſuing the ſtraight forward line of political economy, arreſt, as it were, the ſuffrage of every well diſpoſed citizen —Such talents exiſted in France: and had they combined, and directed their views by a pure love of their country, to one point; all the diſaſters, which in overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the empire have deſtroyed the repoſe of Europe, would not have occurred to diſgrace the cauſe of freedom.</p>
               <p>Every great reform requires ſyſtematic manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and however lightly weak daring heads may treat the gravity of ſuch a remark, the pacific progreſs of every revolution will depend, in a very material degree, on the moderation and reciprocity of conceſſions made by the acting parties. It is true, that in a nation chiefly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated for wit, ſo much prudence could ſcarcely
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:029916_0231_0FE30BB799DC7008"/>
be expected—yet that is not a ſufficient reaſon for condemning all the principles, that produced the revolution: for liberty cannot be conſidered as belonging excluſively to any particular climate, or temper of mind, as a phyſical effect. It was peculiarly urgent, indeed, to form ſuch a coalition, to counteract the dangerous conſequences of old prejudices. The ſtubborn habits of men, whom perſonal intereſt kept firm to their ground, it was morally certain would interrupt the tranquil march of the revolution: it would have been pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent then for men, who agreed in the main ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to have overlooked trifling differences of opinion, till they were ſecured: and of this ſeveral members ſeem to have been aware.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lally-Tolendal, in particular; for giving his opinion on the ſubject of two chambers, he ſaid:—

But reſentment burſting forth, which had long lain concealed (the effect of ſervitude and contumely), joined with the vanity of excelling all other nations in the ſcience of government, to produce an inſolent audacity of conduct, which, aiming at overturn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing, diſcouraged the wavering, and frightened the timid. Deſigning knaves then conceived the plan of riſing to eminence by the accumulating foibles of the multitude, who, looſened from all reſtraint, were eaſily caught by the infidious arts of the moſt contemptible anarchiſts.</p>
               <p>The object of thoſe monſters, who were medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the violation of the ſacred ties of honour and humanity, was early perceived by the more penetrating; but inſtead of oppoſing themſelves to their deſigns, they for the moſt part became initiated into their clubs; whilſt others, more haughty, though perhaps leſs under the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of principles,—if there were any among them, emigrated, leaving their country verging towards the whirlpool of civil diſcord, and all it's concomitant wretchedneſs.</p>
               <p>It is neceſſary for us to attend cloſely to theſe conſiderations, in order to be enabled to form a juſt opinion of the various revolutions which have ſucceeded each other:—becauſe, from a

ſuperficial view of things of this nature, we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attribute to the paſſions, or innate turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of man, what was merely the effect of moral depravity. Hence it has happened, that ſo many of the admirers of the revolution, in its infancy, now talk of extravagant innovations, tending to overturn all the barriers of juſtice,—to trample on the feelings of humanity, and to deſtroy every thing ſplendid and beautiful,—the production of ages, induſtry, taſte, and learning.</p>
               <p>But this revolution did not intereſt Frenchmen alone; for its influence extending throughout the continent, all the paſſions and prejudices of Europe were inſtantly ſet afloat.

away, the right of property grew ſacred. The proweſs or abilities of the leaders of barbarians gave them likewiſe an aſcendency in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive dynaſties; which gaining ſtrength in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ignorance of the age, produced the diſtinctions of men, from which the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equality of conditions has originated; and they have been preſerved long ſince the neceſſity has ceaſed to exiſt.</p>
               <p>During the reign of ignorance, the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſtates could be ſettled only by combats; and the art of dexterouſly murdering ſeems to have decided differences, where reaſon ſhould have been the arbitrator. The cuſtom then of ſettling diſputes at the point of the bayonet, in modern Europe, has been juſtified by the example of barbarians; and whilſt fools continually argue from the practice of inhuman ſavages, that wars are neceſſary evils, courts have found them convenient to perpetuate their power: thus ſlaughter has furniſhed a plauſible pretext for peculation.</p>
               <p>Fortunately in ſpite of the various impediments that have thwarted the advancement of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the bleſſings of ſociety have been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently experienced to convince us, that the only ſolid good to be expected from a government muſt reſult from the ſecurity of our perſons and property. And domeſtic felicity has given a mild luſtre to human happineſs ſuperior to the falſe glory of ſanguinary devaſtation, or magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent robberies. Our fields and vineyards have thus gradually become the principal objects of our care—and it is from this general ſentiment governing the opinion of the civilized part of
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:029916_0236_0FE30B84F60BA5C8"/>
the world, that we are enabled to contemplate, with ſome degree of certainty, the approaching age of peace.</p>
               <p>All that could be done by a body of manners, without a ſoul of morals, to improve mankind, had been tried in France—The reſult was poliſhed ſlavery; and ſuch an inordinate love of pleaſure, as led the majority to ſearch only for enjoyment, till the tone of nature was deſtroyed. Yet ſome few really learned the true art of living; giving that degree of elegance to domeſtic intercourſe, which, prohibiting groſs familiarity, alone can render permanent the family affections, whence all the ſocial virtues ſpring.</p>
               <p>It is a miſtake to ſuppoſe that there was no ſuch thing as domeſtic happineſs in France, or even in Paris. For many French families, on the contrary, exhibited an affectionate urbanity of behaviour to each other, ſeldom to be met with where a certain eaſy gaity does not ſoften the difference of age and condition. The huſband and wife, if not lovers, were the civileſt friends and the tendereſt parents in the world—the only parents, perhaps, who really treated their children like friends; and the moſt affable maſters and miſtreſſes. Mothers were alſo to be found, who, after ſuckling their children, paid a degree of attention to their education, not thought com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the levity of character attributed to them; whilſt they acquired a portion of taſte and knowledge rarely to be found in the women of other countries.

In the ſummer, when they retired to their manſion houſes, they ſpread gladneſs around, and partook of the amuſements of the peaſantry, whom they viſited with paternal ſolicitude. Theſe were, it is true, the rational few, not numerous in any country—and where is led a more uſeful or rational life?</p>
               <p>In the provinces, likewiſe, more ſimplicity of manners prevailing, their morals were more pure: though family pride, as in England, made the moſt noble houſe the royal family of each village, who viſited the grand court only to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its follies. Beſides, in France, the women have not thoſe factitious, ſupercilious manners, common to the Engliſh; and acting more freely, they have more deciſion of character, and even more generoſity. Rouſſeau has taught them alſo a ſcrupulous attention to perſonal cleanlineſs, not generally to be ſeen elſewhere: their coquetry is not only more agreeable, but more natural; and not left a prey to unſatisfied ſenſations, they were leſs romantic indeed than the Engliſh; yet many of them poſſeſſed delicacy of ſentiment.</p>
               <p>It is, perhaps, in a ſtate of comparative idleneſs —purſuing employments not abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſupport life, that the fineſt poliſh is given to the mind, and thoſe perſonal graces, which are inſtantly felt, but cannot be deſcribed; and it is natural to hope, that the labour of acquiring the ſubſtantial virtues, neceſſary to maintain free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, will not render the French leſs pleaſing, when they become more reſpectable.</p>

to the vain deſire of popularity.—Others complained of the neglect of thoſe forms, by which every aſſembly, that aſpires at putting ſome maturity into its decrees, ought to direct debates;—they diſapproved of an afternoon ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting;—of the rapid ſucceſſion of ſubjects, not allowing time for any to be weighed;—of the multiplicity of them;—and of the continual accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, which rendered a calm diſcuſſion phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſically impoſſible.—'What!' they continued, ſhall
<q>the moſt important buſineſs always be treated with the levity, which characterized us before we deſerved to be termed a nation? Eternally the ſport of our vivacity, a happy turn decides with us the moſt ſerious point; and gay ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies are ever our ſubſtitutes for arguments.</q>
—
<q>We do madly the wiſeſt things; and even our reaſon is always connected by ſome filament or other to inconſiſtency.—The national aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly had been a long time reproached for dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on trifling objects; and not attending ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently to the promotion of general good.— When ſuddenly—in a ſingle night, more than twenty important laws are decided by an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar. So much done, in ſuch a ſhort time, is ſo aſtoniſhing, that it appears like a dream.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In reply it was ſaid—
<q>Why deliberate, when all are agreed?—Does not a general good always appear ſelf-evident?—Was it not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to declare theſe patriotic propoſitions to prove their juſtneſs?—The firſt perſon, who pointed out a new tribute to the public intereſt only gave utterance to what we all before felt— there was no need then of diſcuſſion or elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, to make that be adopted, which had
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:029916_0240_0FE30BC50909B0B0"/>
already been reſolved by the greater num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the deputies, and commanded by the awful authority of the nation, in their mandates.—The aſſembly might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded more methodically; but the reſult could not have been more advantageous. It ſeemed as if all the old effects, all the moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering titles of feudal oppreſſions were then put up to auction: and the kind of miſtruſt of the different orders, which provoked re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal conceſſions, was ſtill for the public good.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The nobles and clergy of the provinces, who had not been carried away by the enthuſiaſm of the 4th of Auguſt, felt themſelves particularly aggrieved. Thoſe who were recently noble did not like to mix again on equal terms in towns where they had received the homage paid to princes; and the people, eager to exerciſe their liberty, began to hunt down the game, regardleſs of the miſchief they did to the ſtanding corn. The very conceſſions of the nobility ſeemed to rouſe the vengeance it ought to have allayed; and the populace vented their rage by burning the caſtles, which had been, as it were, legally diſmantled of their feudal fortifications.</p>
               <p>The clergy, in particular, complained, that their deputies had exceeded all bounds in voting away the private property of the body; for they would not allow, that tithes came within the deſcription of feudal tenures. The want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, likewiſe, tended to make the people cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour about preſent grievances, without ſuffering the proſpect of future comfort and reſpectability to have its due force towards calming their minds.
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:029916_0241_0FE30B3693469200"/>
All, therefore, flew to arms, and three millions of men wearing the military garb, ſhowed the natural diſpoſition of the nation; and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent reſolve, no longer to couch ſupinely under oppreſſion. Many exceſſes were the conſequence of this ſudden change; and it is notorious, that the people, in ſome inſtances, became the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the routed party; who continued to uſe every ſtratagem to render the nation diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the revolution.</p>
               <p>It is the nature of man, either in a ſavage ſtate or living in ſociety, to protect his property; and it is wiſe in a government to encourage this ſpirit. For the example now diſplayed by France is a notable proof of the inexpediency of ſtanding armies, ſo long as the people have an intereſt in ſupporting the political ſyſtem under which they live. The national aſſembly, aware of this, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the militia and the municipalities, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to quell the diſorders, which did violence to perſons and property; and they were particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly requeſted to take the moſt watchful care, that the convoys of wheat and flour were not ſtopped by the idle and lawleſs. For ſeveral of the moſt fatal tumults had originated from this cauſe.</p>
               <p>The decrees of the 4th of Auguſt, were then brought forward to be examined and explained; and ſome attempts were made to argue away the eſſence of many of the vaunted ſacrifices.—But the diſcuſſion was interrupted, to attend to buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a more preſſing nature. The preſent ſtate of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="233" facs="unknown:029916_0242_0FE30BCD76183C70"/>
to the aſſembly;—that the laws were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out force;—the courts of juſtice without activity; —and they requeſted them, immediately to point out the coercive meaſures neceſſary to give to the executive authority the influence it had loſt. —'For' obſerved they,
<q>whether the irritated ſenſe of the abuſes, which the king wiſhes to reform, and you deſire to proſcribe for ever, have led the people aſtray; or, the declaration of an univerſal regeneration have ſhaken the various powers upon which the ſocial order repoſed—or whatever, in fact, be the cauſe, gentlemen, the truth is, that public order and tranquillity are diſturbed in almoſt every part of the kingdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Necker, afterwards, having explained the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate of the finances, the extraordinary expences, and the diminution in the produce of the revenue, demanded, in the name of the king, that the aſſembly would ſanction a loan of thirty millions of livres, to fulfil the engagements, and diſcharge the inevitable expenditure of the two approaching months; by which time, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, the conſtitution would be nearly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. Thinking alſo, that the patriotiſm of money-lenders was not to be reckoned upon, he propoſed to add to the five per cent. he mentioned ſome allurements of ſpeculation, to quicken the determination of the lenders— and he further inferred, that private intereſt would then tend to quiet the kingdom, whilſt they were advancing in the formation of a conſtitution, which was to ſecure its future tranquillity, and provide a permanent revenue.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="unknown:029916_0243_0FE30C11ED1BF940"/>This propoſal produced the moſt warm and loud applauſe.—One member propoſed, that the loan ſhould inſtantly be voted in the preſence of the miniſter, as a mark of their entire ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—another offered ſix hundred thouſand livres as a ſecurity that he would raiſe the loan in his own province. This efferveſcence, ſo contagious, which is after all only phyſical ſenſibility, excited by a commotion of the animal ſpirits, proves, that a conſiderable length of time is neceſſary to accuſtom men to exerciſe their rights with deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration; that they may be able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from a kind of inſtinctive confidence in men; and to make them ſubſtitute reſpect for principles, to a blind faith in perſons, even of the moſt diſtinguiſhed abilities.—But to elevate a numerous aſſembly to this calm grandeur; to that permanent dignity, which repreſſes the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the moment, demands, it is probable, a more advanced ſtate of reaſon.</p>
               <p>Lally Tolendal ſupported the neceſſity of adopting the meaſures propoſed for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a loan to ſupply the exigencies of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which were become very urgent; and he refuted the objection, made by ſeveral deputies, who were againſt the grant, that in their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they had been ſtrictly enjoined not to ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion any tax or loan before the conſtitution was formed. On this ſide Mirabeau ranged himſelf; for with all his great talents and ſuperiority of genius, he could not avoid envying inferior abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, when they attracted the leaſt popularity. He therefore, with plauſible rhetoric but ſhallow arguments, oppoſed the loan; and with great parade moved, that the deputies ſhould offer
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:029916_0244_0FE30BCF73171230"/>
their individual credit, inſtead of departing from the very letter of their inſtructions. This was one of thoſe inſtances of pretended diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or falſe patriotiſm, calculated to dazzle the people, whilſt it involved the nation in freſh embarraſſments.</p>
               <p>The plan was referred to the conſideration of the committee appointed to make financial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports: and they accordingly acknowledged the neceſſity of a prompt ſupply; but thought, that the loan might now be obtained without the additional advantages which Necker mentioned as a neceſſary bait. The diſcuſſion was then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with great heat, and even perſonality; till at laſt the intereſt of the loan was fixed at four and an half per cent.; and to ſlip through the knot they were afraid to cut, it was to be ſanctioned under the wing of the decrees of the 4th of Auguſt.</p>
               <p>It did not, however, prove productive; for in the courſe of three weeks, only two millions, ſix hundred thouſand livres were ſubſcribed. And this delay of buſineſs induced the aſſembly to adopt, with leſs ſcruple, another propoſal for a freſh loan, inſtead of the one that did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to anſwer, at a rate leſs advantageous to the nation: or rather they yielded to the neceſſity, into which they had plunged themſelves; and left the mode of obtaining it to the executive power, in ſpite of their former objection. But it was not an eaſy taſk to inſpire the bankers and money-holders with ſufficient faith in the new government, to induce them to come for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to ſupport it; beſides, the previous diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion had converted caution into timidity; and
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:029916_0245_0FE30B2AF27F2B78"/>
the more deſperate the ſtate of the finances ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, the ſtronger grew the ſuſpicion, that threw inſurmountable obſtacles in the way of a temporary relief.</p>
               <p>Settling the preciſe terms of the decrees, which were to aboliſh feudal vaſſalage, the queſtion reſpecting the including of tithes was agitated with moſt earneſtneſs; and the objections urged againſt the abolition were not only ingenious, but reaſonable <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>It is worthy of remark, that the <hi>divine right</hi> of tithes was never inſiſted on,</q>
ſays a French writer,
<q>even by the clergy, during this debate. Yet the year before, when the ſame queſtion was brought forward in the Iriſh houſe of parliament, great ſtreſs was laid on this Gothic idea of their origin.</q>
                  </note> The abbé Sieyes ſpoke with great good ſenſe, aſſerting,
<q>that the tithes were not a tax levied on the nation; but a rent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, for which a proper allowance had been made to the preſent poſſeſſors of the eſtates, to not one of whom they actually belonged. He, therefore, inſiſted, that, if the ſacrifice were neceſſary, it ought to be made to the public, to relieve the people, and not to enrich the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors; who were, generally ſpeaking, of the moſt opulent part of the community.</q>
He adviſed the aſſembly to be on their guard, leſt avarice, under the maſk of zeal, ſhould deceive them, leading the nation to reward rather than indemnify the nobility. The fact was, that the landed intereſt were only reſigning obſolete pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, which they ſcarcely dared exerciſe, to ſecure a ſolid advantage. Society has hitherto been conſtructed in ſuch a vicious manner, that to relieve the poor you muſt benefit the rich.
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:029916_0246_0FE30BD0F6BC7768"/>
The preſent ſubject was a delicate one; the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of tithes would remove a very heavy vex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atious clog, that had long hung on the neck of induſtry; yet it were to be wiſhed, that it could have been ſettled in ſuch a way as not to have ſecured a great pecuniary advantage to the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. For though it was phyſically impoſſible, to make this ſacrifice to ſociety at large immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately; becauſe the proprietors, and more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the leaſe-holders of the eſtates, could not have redeemed the tithes, without diſtreſſing themſelves to a degree, that would nearly have ſtopped the courſe of huſbandry; not to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agricultural improvements, ſo neceſſary in France, and to be looked for as the fruit of liberty:—yet a gradual tax on the original land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord would have prevented the nobility from being the great gainers by their ſo much extolled diſintereſtedneſs, in their fallacious ſacrifice of privileges. Becauſe, for all real property they were to be reimburſed; and for the obnoxious feudal tenures, ſuch as perſonal ſervitude, with others they were aſhamed to enumerate as being due from man to man, the tithes were an ample indemnity; or more properly ſpeaking clear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, except to thoſe who parted with the plumes which raiſed them above their fellows with great regret. It was, indeed, very difficult to ſeparate the evil from the good that would redound to the nation by the doing away of this tax.—The clergy, however, cut the debate ſhort, by reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their right, offering to truſt to the juſtice of the public for the ſtipend in return neceſſary to enable them to ſupport the dignity of their function.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="238" facs="unknown:029916_0247_0FE30C136FD78730"/>On the 13th, therefore, the whole diſcuſſion cloſed; for the other articles did not admit of much diſputation. The preſident accordingly waited on the king, who received his new title with the decrees, to which he afterwards made ſome objections, though the aſſembly conſidered them as virtually ſanctioned <note n="*" place="bottom">It is obſervable, that the ſatisfaction of the people was by no means equal to the diſcontent manifeſted by the privileged orders.</note>.</p>
               <p>A committee of five had been employed to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt a declaration of rights, to precede the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. The opinion of thoſe, who thought that this declaration ought to have been kept back, has already been alluded to; yet the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſeems to require a little further conſideration. And, perhaps, it will appear juſt to ſeparate the character of the philoſopher, who dedicates his exertions to promote the welfare, and perfection of mankind, carrying his views beyond any time he chooſes to mark; from that of the politician, whoſe duty it is to attend to the improvement and intereſt of the time in which he lives, and not ſacrifice any preſent comfort to a proſpect of future perfection or happineſs. If this defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be juſt, the philoſopher naturally becomes a paſſive, the politician an active character. For though the deſire of loudly proclaiming the grand principles of liberty to extend them quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, be one of the moſt powerful a benevolent man, of every deſcription of mind, feels; he no ſooner wiſhes to obey this impulſe, than he finds himſelf placed between two rocks.—Truth commands him to ſay all; wiſdom whiſpers to him to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

him to bound over theſe cautious reſtraints of prudence; did not humanity, enlightened by a knowledge of human nature, make him dread to purchaſe the good of poſterity too dearly, by the miſery of the preſent generation.</p>
               <p>The debates reſpecting the adoption of the declaration of rights became very ſpirited; and much heterogeneous matter was introduced, to lengthen the diſcuſſion and heat the diſputants, as the different articles were reviewed. The article reſpecting religion particularly arreſted the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the aſſembly, and produced one of thoſe tumultuous ſcenes, which have ſo often diſgraced their deliberations. The intolerant ſentiments uttered; and even the inſertion of ſome amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which could not, without a contradiction in terms, find a place in a declaration of rights; proved, that the aſſembly contained a majority, who were ſtill governed by prejudices inimical to the full extent of that liberty, which is the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable right of each citizen, when it does not infringe on the equal enjoyment of the ſame por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by his neighbour <note n="*" place="bottom">See the artcile 10.
<q>No man ought to be moleſted on account of his opinions, not even on account of his religious opinions, provided his avowal of them does not diſturb the public order eſtabliſhed by law.</q>
                  </note>. The moſt ſenſible part of the aſſembly aſſerted, that religion ought not to be mentioned, unleſs to declare, that the free exerciſe of it was a right in common with the free utterance of all opinions; which came under civil cognizance only when they aſſumed a form, namely, when they produced effects, that claſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the laws; and even then it was the

               <p>In this declaration are found the principles of political and civil liberty, introduced by a very ſolemn exordium:—Declaring
<q>that, as ignorance, forgetfulneſs, and contempt of the rights of men, are the ſole cauſes of public grievances, and of the corruption of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the aſſembly had reſolved to re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, in a ſolemn declaration, the natural, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſcriptible, and ſacred rights of man; in order that this declaration, conſtantly preſent to all the members of the ſocial body, may continually remind them of their rights, and of their duties; that, having it in their power every moment to compare the acts of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative and executive authorities with the purpoſe of all political inſtitutions, they may the more reſpect them; and that the remonſtrances of the citizens, founded. in future, on ſimple and inconteſtible principles, may always tend to ſupport the conſtitution, and to promote the happineſs of the whole community.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Some temporary buſineſs, towards reſtoring public tranquillity, and to give force to the laws, inſulted by the licentious conduct of men inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated merely by the expectation of freedom, ſcented from a-far, being diſpatched, the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a conſtitution became the ſtanding labour of the aſſembly.</p>
               <p>The firſt queſtion naturally fell under this head—what ſhare of power ought the king to be allowed to poſſeſs in the legiſlature This was an important conſideration for men, who were all politicians in theory; and many of whom,
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:029916_0250_0FE30BD8387D0F40"/>
having ſuffered under the abſolute ſway of the king's miniſters, ſtill felt the ſmart of their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and a contempt for the power that authorized their dominion: whilſt the blind zealots for the indefeaſible rights of kings, though they were aſhamed of the phraſe, heated the imagination of their party, by the moſt inflated encomiums of the benefits ariſing from extenſive kingly prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives, and vapid remarks on the Britiſh conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and other forms of government, obviouſly to diſplay their erudition. The moſt noiſy inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corus debates enſued, and the aſſembly ſeemed to meet rather to quarrel than deliberate. A divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion the moſt decided conſequently took place; which, under different appellations, and profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different principles, has ever ſince conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to convulſe the ſenate; if the legiſlative aſſembly, or the convention, deſerve a name ſo dignified.</p>
               <p>In diſcuſſing whether the royal ſanction ſhould be neceſſary to the validity of the acts of the legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlative body, a variety of extraneous ſubjects, and others prematurely forward, ſo entangled the main queſtion, as to render it difficult to give a clear and brief account of the debates; without lending a degree of reaſonableneſs to them, that the manner of arguing, rudely perſonal, and loudly uncivil, ſeemed to deſtroy. For good lungs ſoon became more neceſſary in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly than ſound arguments, to enable a ſpeaker to ſilence the confuſion of tongues; and make known his opinion to men, who were eager only to anounce their own. Thus modeſt men had no chance to be heard, though perſuaſion dwelt on their lips; and even Mirabeau, with his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:029916_0251_0FE30C1DC777E168"/>
eloquence, and juſtneſs of thought, procured attention as much by the thundering emphaſis which he gave to his periods, as by his ſtriking and forcible aſſociation of ideas.</p>
               <p>As a nation, the French are certainly the moſt eloquent people in the world; their lively feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings giving the warmth of paſſion to every argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they attempt to ſupport.

Thus every thing contributing to excite the emotions, which lead men only to court admiration, the good of the people was too often ſacrificed to the deſire of pleaſing them. And ſo completely was the tide of their affection for the king turned, that they ſeemed averſe to his having any portion of legiſlative authority in the new conſtitution.</p>
               <p>The duke de Liancourt divided the queſtion reſpecting the ſhare of power he was to enjoy as
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:029916_0252_0FE30BE8F4E025E8"/>
a part of the government. 1<hi>ſt. Is the royal ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indiſpenſibly neceſſary, to give the actual force of law to the decrees of the national aſſembly?</hi> 2<hi>dly. Ought the king to be an integrant portion of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature?</hi> In England the phraſe <hi>royal aſſent</hi> has been adopted, as expreſſive of a poſitive act; but the French, rather chooſing to diſtinguiſh the ſame act of power by a negative, fixed on the latin word <hi>veto, I forbid.</hi> And then it became a queſtion, how far this <hi>veto</hi> ought to extend, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the prince to be inveſted with it.—Was it deciſively to obſtruct the enaction of a law paſſed by the legiſlative body? or only to ſuſpend it, till an appeal could be made to the people by a new election?</p>
               <p>The aſſembly in this inſtance ſeem to have acted with ſtrange confuſion of mind, or a total ignorance of the nature of a mixed government: for either the queſtion was nugatory, or a king uſeleſs. Lally-Tolendal, Mounier, and Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau, argued for the abſolute <hi>veto.</hi>—
<q>Two pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</q>
ſays Mirabeau,
<q>are neceſſary to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of the body-politic, in the orderly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of it's functions:—To will—and to act. By the firſt, ſociety eſtabliſhes the regulations which ought all to conſpire to one end—the good of all:—By the ſecond, theſe regulations are carried into execution: and public authority is exerted, to make ſociety triumph over the obſtacles, which might ariſe from the oppoſite wills of individuals. In a great nation, theſe two powers cannot be exerciſed by the people: whence comes the neceſſity of repreſentatives, to exerciſe the faculty of willing, or the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power; and alſo of another ſpecies of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſation,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:029916_0253_0FE30C1F4B89C410"/>
to exerciſe the faculty of acting; or, the executive power.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He further inſiſts, that
<q>the poſſeſſion of this power is the only way to render a king uſeful, and to enable him to act as a check on the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative body: the majority of which might ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannize i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the moſt deſpotic manner, even in the ſenate, to the very expulſion of the members, who dared to thwart the meaſures they could not approve. For under a weak prince, a little time and addreſs alone would be neceſſary, to eſtabliſh legally the dominion of an army of ariſtocrats; who, making the royal authority only the paſſive inſtrument of their will, might replunge the people into their old ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>The prince, therefore, being the perpetual repreſentative of the people, as the deputies are their repreſentatives elected at certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, is equally their ſafe-guard.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>No perſon exclaims againſt the <hi>veto</hi> of the national aſſembly; which is, in reality, only a right the people have confided in their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, to oppoſe every propoſition, that would tend to re-eſtabliſh miniſterial deſpotiſm. Why then object to the <hi>veto</hi> of the prince, which is but another right, eſpecially confided in him by the people, becauſe he and they are equally intereſted to prevent the eſtabliſhment of an ariſtocracy?</q>
               </p>
               <p>He proceeds to prove,
<q>that, whilſt the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative body is reſpectable, the <hi>veto</hi> of the king cannot do harm, though it is a ſalutary check on their deliberations; and granting, that the influence of the crown has a tendency to increaſe,
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:029916_0254_0FE30BDB20318420"/>
a permanent aſſembly would be a ſufficient counterpoiſe for the royal negative. Let us,</q>
he concludes,
<q>have an annual national aſſembly, let miniſters be made reſponſible; and the royal ſanction without any ſpecified reſtrictions, but in fact, perfectly limited, will be the palladium of national liberty, and the moſt precious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of the liberty of the people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſuffered by the abuſe of abſolute power, many of the deputies, afraid to entruſt their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional monarchs with any, oppoſed the <hi>veto;</hi> leſt it ſhould palſy the operations of the national aſſembly, and bring back the old deſpotiſm of the cabinet. The diſcuſſion likewiſe extending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it's walls, was as ſuperficially and as warmly treated by thoſe, who thought only of the old government, when they talked of framing a new one. And as the people were now led by hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed men, who found it the ſhorteſt way to popularity, to deliver exaggerated elogiums on liberty, they began to look for a degree of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in their government, incompatible with the preſent ſtate of their manners; and of which they had no perfect idea. It is not then ſurpriſing, that it ſhould become a mark of patriotiſm, to oppoſe the <hi>veto;</hi> though Mirabeau never gave a ſtronger proof of his, than in ſupporting it; convinced that it was the intereſt of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple he was eſpouſing, whilſt he riſked their favour.</p>
               <p>The will of the public was, in reality, ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided, that they would ſcarcely allow the <hi>veto</hi> to be mentioned; and the aſſembly, to ſteer a mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle courſe, adopted the <hi>ſuſpenſive veto</hi>; after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering ſome other important elements of the

                  </gap>ather, breaking his fall, have induced him to ſubmit patiently to other reſtraints, leſs humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating to him, though more beneficial to the people. For it is evident from experience, and might have
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:029916_0256_0FE30BDCB309AC80"/>
been foreſeen, that the determination on this queſtion was one grand ſource of the continual bickerings of the aſſembly with the court and miniſtry; who took care to make the king ſee, that he was ſet up as an idol, merely to receive the mock reſpect of the legiſlative body, till they were quite ſure of the people.</p>
               <p>Could it, indeed, have been aſcertained, that Louis, or rather the queen, would have tamely born with ſuch a diminution of power, this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure might have been deemed prudent; becauſe it was then morally certain, that the monarchy would have expired naturally with the diſſolution of the king.

ſee that the conſtitution was accepted, not ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. This report carries with it an air of imbecility, which renders it almoſt incredible: for, if the aſſembly were determined to oblige the king to accept their decrees, they had better have told him ſo with becoming dignity, and made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for his retiring from a poſt in which he was uſeleſs. Inſtead of this, he was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhuffled off the throne; and treated with cruelty as well as comtempt. It would have been at leaſt ingenuous, and might be deemed mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous, had they allowed him to retire with a third of the ſtipend, which they afterwards voted him, when he continued to appear like a theatrical king, only to excite the pity of the vulgar, and to ſerve as a pretext for the deſpots of Europe to urge in juſtification of their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. The liberating an impriſoned monarch was a plauſible motive, though the real one was obviouſly to ſtop the progreſs of principles, which, once permitted to extend themſelves, would ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately ſap the foundation of their tyranny, and overturn all the courts in Europe.

                  <pb n="250" facs="unknown:029916_0259_0FE30C20CF4E9FF8"/>Some apprehenſions of this kind may have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to the aſſembly: though it rather appears, that they were either influenced by a ridiculous pride, not being willing to take the Britiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſo far as it reſpected the prerogative, for their model; or intimidated by the people, who, during the long debate, had outrageouſly expreſſed their will, and even handed about a liſt of proſcriptions, in which the <hi>vetoiſts</hi> were denounced as traitors worthy of death. Be this as it may, they determined on a half-way mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, that irritated the court without appeaſing the people. Having previouſly decreed, that the national aſſembly ſhould be permanent, that is always exiſting, inſtead of being diſſolved at the cloſe of every ſeſſion, they reſolved, that the <hi>veto</hi> of the king ſhould ſuſpend the enaction of a law only during two legiſlatures.
<q>The wiſdom of this law,</q>
ſays Rabaud,
<q>was univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged,</q>
though the folly of it rather merited univerſal reprobation.</p>
               <p>From the manner indeed, in which the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was conſtituted, it was to be dreaded, that its members would not long ſuſtain the dignity, with which they commenced the career of their buſineſs: becauſe the party, that oppoſed with ſuch bitterneſs the junction of the three orders, ſtill oppoſing with rancorous heat, and wily ſtratagems, every meaſure propoſed by the really patriotic members, were indirectly ſeconded by the inſincere and wavering; who, having no motive to govern their conduct, but the moſt deteſtable ſelfiſhneſs, the offspring of vanity or avarice always took the ſide beſt calculated to gratify the crude wiſhes of the multitude. And
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:029916_0260_0FE30B2482B1D5A8"/>
this unyoked multitude, now ſuddenly initiated into the ſcience of civil and natural rights, all become conſummate politicians, began to control the deciſions of a divided aſſembly, rendered timid by inteſtine broils.</p>
               <p>There were beſides many circumſtances, which tended to make any attempt to counteract this influence very difficult. At the meeting of the ſtates-general, the whole court-party, with the greater proportion of both the nobility and cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, were in oppoſition to the third eſtate: and though the number of the latter was equal to that of the other two orders, they had alſo to contend with the inveterate prejudices of ages. The court had thought only of deviſing means to cruſh them; and had the ſoldiery acted with the blind zeal common to men of this profeſſion, it would of itſelf have been ſufficient to have completely diſconcerted their views. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the cabinet, and the diſcovery of the atrocious conſpiracy, which had been formed againſt the people and their idolized repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, provoking the reſentment and vengeance of the nation, palſied all authority, and rendered the laws that had emanated from it contemptible. To oppoſe this torrent of opinions, like an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous current, that after heavy rains, defying all reſiſtance, bears away on its raging boſom every obſtacle, required the moſt enlightened prudence and determined reſolution.</p>
               <p>So much wiſdom and firmneſs ſeldom fall to the lot of any country: and it could ſcarcely have been expected from the depraved and volatile French; who proudly, or ignorantly, determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to follow no political track, ſeem to have
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:029916_0261_0FE30C26CEA64268"/>
fixed on a ſyſtem proper only for a people in the higheſt ſtage of civilization:—a ſyſtem of itſelf calculated to diſorganize the government, and throw embarraſſments into all its operations. This was an error ſo groſs as to demand the ſevereſt animadverſions. For this political plan, ever conſidered as utopian by all men who had not traced the progreſs of reaſon, or calculated the degree of perfectibility the human faculties are capable of attaining, was, it might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, the moſt improper for the degenerate ſociety of France. The exertions of the very admirers of the revolution were, likewiſe, far from being permanent; and they could hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been expected to poſſeſs ſufficient vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue to ſupport a government, the duration of which they at leaſt feared would be ſhort. The men termed experienced believed it phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally impoſſible; and no arguments were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent enough to convince them of the contrary: ſo that, they leaving the taſk to mock patriots and enthuſiaſts, a freſh odium has been thrown on principles, which, notwithſtanding are gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ground. Things muſt be left to their natural courſe; and the accelerating progreſs of truth promiſes to demonſtrate what no arguments have hitherto been able to prove.</p>
               <p>The foundation of liberty was laid in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of rights; the firſt three articles of which contain the great principles of natural, political, and civil liberty.—Firſt, that men are born, and alway continue, free, and equal in reſpect to their rights:—civil diſtinctions, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, can be founded only on public utility. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the end of all political aſſociations is the
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:029916_0262_0FE30BEAF524A8F8"/>

Thirdly, the nation is the ſource of all ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: no body of men, no individual, can then be entitled to any authority, which is not derived from it. The firſt article, eſtabliſhing the equality of man, ſtrikes at the root of all uſeleſs diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:—the ſecond, ſecuring his rights againſt oppreſſion, maintains his dignity:—and the third, acknowledging the ſovereignty of the nation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the authority of the people.—Theſe are the eſſential points of a good government: and it is only neceſſary when theſe points are aſcertained by a nation, and ſolemnly ratified in the hearts of its citizens, to take care in the formation of a political ſyſtem, to provide againſt the abuſe of the executive part; whilſt equal caution ſhould be obſerved, not to deſtroy its efficiency, as on that depend its juſtice, vigour, and promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. The other articles are explanatory of the nature and intent of theſe rights, and ought to have had more attention paid to them, when the ſtructure was raiſed, to which they ſerved as a baſis.</p>

The oppoſers of two chambers, without allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that there was any political wiſdom in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing one houſe of repreſentatives to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the reſolves of the other, ridiculed the idea

of a balance of power, and inſtanced the abuſes of the Engliſh government to give force to their objections.

The very diviſion of the nobility ſerved to haſten it, and ſtrengthened the arguments of the popular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; who finding that they could rely on the concurrence of the pariſh prieſts, whoſe wiſhes in favour of the unity of the aſſembly were quickly betrayed by the opinions of their lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing orators, demanded the deciſion of a queſtion, that had been agitated in the moſt tumultuous ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And to ſhew previouſly their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire diſintereſtedneſs, as well as fear of allowing the exerciſe of power to become familiar, much leſs neceſſary to any members of the community, they unanimouſly voted, that for each legiſlature,

the name given to the meeting of the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, a total change of the deputies ſhould take place.</p>
               <p>The very nobility, in fact, were far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing united in ſupport of two chambers. The order was a numerous one: and to eſtabliſh an equality of privileges, it was neceſſary, that they ſhould all concur to elect the upper chamber, as the repreſentatives of the whole body; whilſt the nobles of the court, and of the ancient houſes, ſecretly indulged the hope of eſtabliſhing a peerage; which would not only raiſe them above the commons, but keep at a proper diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance the upſtart nobility, with whom they had heretofore impatiently joſtled. There was even another cauſe of jealouſy: for it was preſumed, that the forty-ſeven nobles, who firſt joined the aſſembly, would now be rewarded. In ſhort, the idle fears and more contemptible vanity of the different parties now operated ſo much in favour of an indiviſible ſenate, that the queſtion was decided by a great majority, to the entire ſatisfaction of the public, who were almoſt as eager for one chamber, as averſe to the <hi>veto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The deputies, who oppoſed the upper chamber to promote the good of ſociety, did it from a belief, that it would be the aſylum of a new ariſtocracy; and from a total ignorance, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of ideas, reſpecting its utility. Whilſt the oppreſſions of the feudal ſyſtem being ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the minds of the people, they conſidered a diviſion of the legiſlative body as inconſiſtent with the freedom and equality they were taught to expect as the prime bleſſings of a new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. The very mention of <hi>two chambers</hi>
                  <pb n="256" facs="unknown:029916_0265_0FE30C29C7FB7118"/>
carried them back to the old diſpute, reſpecting the negative of the different orders; and ſeemed to ſubvert the revolution. Such fears, degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating into weakneſs, can only be accounted for by recollecting the many cruel thraldoms, from which they had ſo recently eſcaped. Beſides, the remembrance of their former ſervitude, and the reſentment excited by the late ſtruggle to prove they were men, created in their enthuſiaſtic imaginations ſuch a multitude of horrors, and fantaſtic images of new dangers, as did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them to exerciſe the full powers of their reaſon. So that to convince them of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of a new inſtitution, and heat the ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of it, nothing more was neceſſary, than to ſhow that it was the very reverſe of thoſe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the partizans of the old government.</p>
               <p>The wiſdom of giving to the executive part of a government an abſolute <hi>veto</hi> might very juſtly have been queſtioned; as it ſeems to be giving a power to one man to counteract the will of a whole people—an abſurdity too groſs to merit refutation. Still, whilſt crowns are a neceſſary bauble to pleaſe the multitude, it is alſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that their dignity ſhould be ſupported, in order to prevent an overweening ariſtocracy from concentrating all authority in themſelves. This ſeems to have been expedient, likewiſe, as long as the manners of barbarians remained: as ſavages are naturally pleaſed with glaſs and beads, in proportion as they afford a ſtriking contraſt to the rude materials of their own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brication.</p>
               <p>In the progreſſive influence of knowledge on manners, both dreſs and governments appear to

If theſe have been ſupported hitherto by childiſh ignorance, they ſeem to be loſing their influence, as the underſtanding of the world approaches to manhood: for, as they grow wiſer, the people will look for the ſolid advantages of ſociety; and watching wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Beſides, it is very probable, in the ſame ſtate of reaſon, that a faction may ariſe, which will controul the aſſembly; and, acting contrary to the dictates of wiſdom, throw the ſtate into the
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:029916_0267_0FE30B38354FCBF0"/>
moſt dangerous convulſions of anarchy; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, it ought to form a primary object with a conſtituting aſſembly, to prevent, by ſome ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary contrivance, the miſchief flowing from ſuch ſources. The obvious preventative is a ſecond chamber, or ſenate, which would not, it is moſt likely, be under the influence of the ſame faction; and it is at leaſt certain, that its deciſions would not be directed by the ſame orators. The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage would be more certain if buſineſs were not conducted in the two chambers in a ſimilar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Thus by making the moſt numerous aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the moſt active, the other would have more time to weigh the probable conſequence of any act or decree, which would prevent thoſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences; or, at leaſt, many of them, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of haſte or faction.</p>
               <p>This ſyſtem in an old government is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of improvement. The minds of young men generally having more fire, activity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, it would be politically wiſe to reſtrict the age of the ſenators to thirty-five, or forty years; at which period of life they moſt likely would have gone through a certain routine of buſineſs; and become more ſage and ſteady, they would be better calculated to decide reſpecting the policy, or wiſdom of the acts of the chamber of repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>It is true, France was in ſuch a ſtate at the time of the revolution, that a like improvement could not have been inſtantly carried into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the ariſtocratical influence was juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be dreaded. The conſtituting aſſembly then ſhould have remained indiviſible; and as the members became in ſome meaſure acquainted
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:029916_0268_0FE30BEDFAFF8018"/>
with legiſlative buſineſs, they would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared ſenators for the upper chamber. All the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture legiſlatures being divided into two chambers, a houſe of repreſentatives, and a ſenate, the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the national aſſembly might have been permitted to be elected for the ſenate, though they ſhould not have attained the age preſcribed; for the reſtriction needed not to have taken place until the government found its level, and even then, the members of the preceding houſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives might have been allowed to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned for the ſenate.</p>
               <p>It has been a common remark of moraliſts, that we are the leaſt acquainted with our own characters. This has been literally the caſe with the French: for certainly no people ſtand in ſuch great need of a check; and, totally deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of experience in political ſcience, it muſt have been clear to all men of ſound underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſome ſuch plan alone would have ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them to avoid many fatal errors.</p>
               <p>The firſt efforts of the national aſſembly were truly magnanimous; but the character of the men was too light, to maintain the ſame hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, when not warmed by paſſion—too giddy, to ſupport with grave dignity the ſplendor of ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den glory. Their vanity was alſo unbounded; and their falſe eſtimate of diſintereſtedneſs of conduct, whilſt they betrayed puerility of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was not among the leaſt of the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, which have befallen that unhappy country. Their hearts had been too long ſophiſticated, to ſuggeſt the beſt mode of communicating free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to millions; and their heads were ſtill leſs calculated to lay down a practicable plan of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,

adapted to the ſtate of knowledge of the age. So much ſo, that they ſeem to have ſelected from books only the regulations proper for a period of perfect civilization.</p>

               <p>Whilſt the moſt ingenious theoriſts, or deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate partizans of the people, take advantage of this infirmity of our nature, the conſequences muſt ſometimes prove deſtructive to ſociety, if they do not end in the moſt dreadful anarchy. For when the members of a ſtate are not direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by practical knowledge, every one produces a plan of polity, till the confuſion becomes general, and the nation plunges into wretchedneſs, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing the ſchemes of thoſe philoſophers of genius, who, advancing before their age, have ſketched the model of a perfect ſyſtem of government. Thus it happened in France, that Hume's idea of a perfect commonwealth, the adoption of which would be eligible only when civilization has arrived at a much greater degree of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and knowledge is more generally diffuſed than at the preſent period, was nevertheleſs cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen as the model of their new government, with a few exceptions, by the conſtituent aſſembly: which choice doubtleſs proceeded from the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

not having had an opportunity to acquire a knowledge of practical liberty. Some of the members, it is true, alluded to the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made by the Americans on the plan of the Engliſh conſtitution; but the great majority, deſpiſing experience, were for forming at once, a ſyſtem much more perfect. And this ſelf-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency has produced thoſe dreadful outrages, and attacks, made by the anarchiſts of that country on perſonal liberty, property, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe ſociety holds ſacre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Theſe melancholy conſiderations ſeem to me to afford irrefragable arguments to prove that it is neceſſary for all governments, which have for their object the happineſs of the people, to make the power of altering peaceably a fundamental principle of their conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Still, if the attempt to carry prematurely into execution the ſublime theory, which has occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome of the beſt heads to form, have afforded an opportunity to ſuperficial politicians, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it as abſurd and chimerical, becauſe it has not been attended with immediate ſucceſs, the advocates for the extenſion of truth and reaſon ought not to deſpair. For when we contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the ſlow improvement, that has been made in the ſcience of government; and, that even the ſyſtem of the Britiſh conſtitution was conſidered, by ſome of the moſt enlightened ancients, as the ſublimeſt theory the human mind was able to conceive, though not reducible to practice, they ſhould not relax in their endeavours to bring to maturity a polity more ſimple—which promiſes more equal freedom, and general happineſs to mankind.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>AFTER the national aſſembly had deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, that the legiſlative body ſhould conſiſt of one houſe, to be renewed every two years, they appear to have had ſome ſuſpicion of the impolicy of the decree; but not allowing themſelves time to comprehend the uſe of a ſenate taken from the body of the people, they attempted to ſilence the fears, ſome moderate men entertained, of the bad conſequences which might ariſe from the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of an impetuous aſſembly without a check, by aſſuring them, that the delay, the <hi>veto</hi> would occaſion, was a ſufficient counterpoiſe. They repreſented the king's <hi>veto</hi> as the negative arche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type of the national will; adding, that it would be the duty of the ſovereign to examine with vigilance the juſtice or wiſdom of their decrees; and by the exertion of his power prevent the haſty eſtabliſhment of any laws inimical to the
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:029916_0272_0FE30BF8299297E8"/>
public good. So eaſy is it for men to frame arguments to cover the homely features of their own folly—ſo dangerous is it to follow a refined theory, however feaſible it may appear, when the happineſs of an empire depends on its ſucceſs; and ſo inconſiderately did the national aſſembly act in this great buſineſs, that they did not wait even to determine the preciſe meaning of the word <hi>ſanction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the king then repreſented the negative will of the nation, which the aſſembly pretended to ſay he did; and if he poſſeſſed the ſupreme wiſdom and moderation neceſſary to guaranty that will, which ſuppoſing he did not, it was a folly too groſs to require any comment; in the name of common ſenſe—why was his <hi>veto ſuſpenſive?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is obvious,—the aſſembly had not ſufficient courage to take a decided part.—They knew, that the king and court could not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon; yet they had not the magnanimity to give them up altogether. They juſtly dreaded the depravity and influence of the nobles; but they had not the ſagacity to model the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ſuch a manner, as would have defeated their future conſpiracies, and rendered their power nugatory; though they had the example of the Thirteen States of America before them, from which they had drawn what little practical knowledge of liberty they poſſeſſed. —But, no; the regeneration of France muſt lead to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation of the whole globe. The political ſyſtem of Frenchmen muſt ſerve as a model for all the free ſtates in the univerſe!—<hi>Vive la liberté</hi>
                  <pb n="264" facs="unknown:029916_0273_0FE30C33745EAD60"/>
—was the only cry—and <hi>la bagatelle</hi> entered into every debate—whilſt the whole nation, wild with joy, was hailing the commencement of the golden age.</p>
               <p>The women too, not to be outdone by the Roman dames, came forward, during this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion, to ſacrifice their ornaments for the good of their country. And this freſh example of public ſpirit was alſo given by the third eſtate; for they were the wives and daughters of artizans, who firſt renounced their female pride—or rather made one kind of vanity take place of another. However, the offering was made with theatrical grace; and the lively applauſes of the aſſembly were reiterated with great gallantry.</p>
               <p>Another interruption had likewiſe occurred, of a more ſerious nature.—For after they had decreed with an unanimous voice—That <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the king is ſacred and inviolable,</hi> that <hi>the throne is indiviſible;</hi> that <hi>the crown is hereditary, in the males of the reigning family, according to the order of primogeniture, to the perpetual excluſion of females,</hi> a deputy propoſed, that, before going any further, they ſhould decide
<q>whether the branch reigning in Spain could reign in France, though it had renounced the crown of the latter kingdom by the moſt authentic treaties.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Several of the moſt reſpectable members re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, that this was a delicate buſineſs with which it was impolitic to meddle at preſent, and as unneceſſary as imprudent. Mirabeau was of this opinion; but when he found, that much time was likely to be conſumed in idle debates, and contemptible vehemence, he endeavoured to cut
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:029916_0274_0FE30BF9AD471850"/>
the matter ſhort by moving a new queſtion— namely,
<q>that no one could reign in France, who was not born in the kingdom.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But nothing could prevent the agitation of the ſame ſubject for three days; prolonged either by the fears of one party, or the deſire of another to embroil the aſſembly, and retard the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a conſtitution. Mirabeau made ſeveral ſevere, but juſt remarks, on the character of Louis XIV. whoſe ambition had produced the diſpute; and reprobated with dignity, their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of treating a people, as if they were the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a chief. Should any difficulty ariſe, in future, he maintained, that the nation would then be competent of judge of it; and had an equal right to determine the ſucceſſion, as to chooſe a new ſyſtem of government.</p>
               <p>The aſſembly, though generally ſo inattentive to the ſuggeſtions of ſound policy, deſpiſing moderation, became now beyond meaſure ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous. Some deputies repreſented the danger of alienating to the Engliſh the commerce of Spain, by diſguſting it's court; and others anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipated the inteſtine troubles, which a doubt reſpecting the unchangeable deſcent of the crown might produce. At laſt they reſolved to add to the declaration, reſpecting the monarchy, that they did not mean to make the decree, <hi>by any means prejudge the effect of renunciations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt they were ſettling theſe things in the aſſembly the refractory nobles and clergy were intriguing to prevent the king from giving his aſſent to the promulgation of the decrees of the 4th of Auguſt. The royal <hi>ſanction</hi> had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded before the import of the word was
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:029916_0275_0FE30C35BA2F08E8"/>
ſcanned; and the court taking advantage of this ambiguity, made the king pretend he miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the demand; and imagined that they merely aſked for his opinion, and not to know his will. Inſtead then of a ſimple monoſyllable, he replied by a memoir. He approved, in general, of the ſpirit of theſe determinations; but entered into an inveſtigation, more or leſs copious, of every article. He weighed the advantages and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences; and pointed out precautions and modifications, which appeared to him neceſſary to realize the former and prevent the latter. He objected particularly to the abolition of ſome rents; which, though ſubſtitutes for perſonal ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, were now actual property; he ſuggeſted ſome difficulty that might attend the abolition of tithes; and hinted, that the German princes, who had poſſeſſions in Alſace, ſecured to them by treaty, might reſent the infringement. In anſwer to the laſt objection, a member obſerved, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of this province, who had long been ſinking under the weight of theſe privileges, daily augmented by the connivance of miniſters, had inſerted an article in their inſtructions ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly demanding the abolition of this deſtructive ſyſtem; which reduced them to deſpair, and forced them continually to emigrate. Several of the deputies wiſhed to have the king's reply re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the examination of a committee; yet, a great majority inſiſting, that the decrees of the 4th of Auguſt were not new laws, to be carried into force by the executive power, but abuſes which it was abſolutely neceſſary to clear away before the formation of a conſtitution, demanded their immediate promulgation. Accordingly they
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:029916_0276_0FE30BFBCDC7A620"/>
reſolved, that the preſident ſhould wait on the king and requeſt him immediately to order the promulgation of the decrees; aſſuring him at the ſame time, that the national aſſembly, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering each article ſeparately, would pay the moſt ſcrupulous attention to the obſervations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by his majeſty.</p>
               <p>This imperative petition had the deſired effect, and the king acceded, the 20th of September, to their will, ſanctioning decrees he did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.</p>
               <p>This was the firſt glaring inſtance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting aſſembly acting contrary to it's preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and the king, long in the habit of diſſemb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, always yielding to the preſſure of remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, no matter from what quarter they came, with criminal inſincerity acknowledging himſelf a cypher, laid the foundation of his own inſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificancy, by ordering the promulgation of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, which he believed were incompatible with juſtice, and might involve the French monarchy in diſagreeable diſputes with foreign princes, when peace was particularly neceſſary to calm it's inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal convulſions.</p>
               <p>If a chief magiſtrate be of any conſequence to a ſtate, his wiſdom ought to appear in the dignity and firmneſs of his actions.—But, if he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as the fountain of juſtice and honour, and do not poſſeſs the abilities and magnanimity of a common man, in what a wretched light muſt he be viewed by the eyes of diſcernment and common ſenſe?—And, if the framers of a conſtitution create a power that muſt continually act at variance with itſelf, they not only undermine the pillars of their own fabric, but they inſert the
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:029916_0277_0FE30C37420F11B0"/>
ſcion of a diſeaſe the moſt deſtructive to truth and morals.</p>
               <p>After complying with this compulſatory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, Louis, who finding that he was left with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſhare of power ſeems to have thought very little of his <hi>ſuſpenſive veto,</hi> determined to play a part that would give an air of ſincerity to his preſent conduct, whilſt his object was ſecretly to favour the efforts of the counter-revolutioniſts; and if poſſible effect his own eſcape.—But, in the mean time, he endeavoured to make ſuch uſe of it as might prevent the total derangement of the old ſyſtem, without unveiling his ſecret views, and intentions. It is difficult to determine which was the moſt reprehenſible, the folly of the aſſembly, or the duplicity of the king. If Louis were without character, and controlled by a court without virtue, it amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a demonſtration, that every inſidious mean would be employed by the courtiers to reinſtate the old government; and recover, if poſſible, their former ſplendor and voluptuous eaſe. For, though they were diſperſed, it was notorious to all France, nay, to all Europe, that a conſtant correſpondence was kept up between the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parties, and their projects concerted by one of the moſt intriguing of diſappointed men <note n="*" place="bottom">Calonne.</note>. It was obvious, therefore, to Mirabeau, that the king ought to be gained over to the ſide of the people; and made to conſider himſelf as their benefactor, in order to detach him from the cabal. But in this reſpect he was unfortunately over-ruled. This mixture of magnanimity, and
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:029916_0278_0FE30C02D639D990"/>
timidity, of wiſdom, and headſtrong folly, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played by the aſſembly, appears at the firſt view, to involve ſuch a contradiction, that every perſon unacquainted with the French character would be ready to call in queſtion the truth of thoſe undeniable facts, which crowd on the heels of each other during the progreſs of the great events, that formed the revolution. A ſuperficial glance over the circumſtances, will not enable us to account for an inconſiſtency, which bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders on improbability.—We muſt, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, ever keep in our thoughts, that, whilſt they were directed in their political plans by a wild, half comprehended theory, their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſtill governed by the old chivalrous ſenſe of honour, which diffuſing a degree of romantic heroiſm into all their actions, a falſe magnanimity would not permit them to queſtion the veracity of a man, on whom they believed they were conferring favours; and for whom they certainly made great allowance, if they did not forgive him for countenancing plots, which tended to undermine their favourite ſyſtem.</p>
               <p>It is, perhaps, the characteriſtic of vanity, to become enamoured with ideas, in proportion as they were remote from its conception, until brought to the mind by cauſes ſo natural, as to induce it to believe, that they are the happy and ſpontaneous flow of its own prolific brain. Their ſplendor then eclipſing his judgment, the man is hurried on by enthuſiaſm and ſelf-ſufficiency, like a ſhip at ſea, without ballaſt or helm, by every breath of wind: and, to carry the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon ſtill further, ſhould a tempeſt chance to riſe in the ſtate, he is ſwallowed up in the whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pools of confuſion, into the very midſt of which
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:029916_0279_0FE30C38C8380CB8"/>
his conceit has plunged him; as the veſſel, that was not prepared to ſtem the violence of a hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricane, is buried in the raging ſurge.</p>
               <p>The occaſions of remarking, that Frenchmen are the vaineſt men living, often occur, and here it muſt be inſiſted on: for no ſooner had they taken poſſeſſion of certain philoſophical truths, perſuading themſelves, that the world was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to them for the diſcovery, than they ſeem to have overlooked every other conſideration, but their adoption. Much evil has been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence; yet France is certainly highly indebted to the national aſſembly for eſtabliſhing many conſtitutional principles of liberty, which muſt greatly accelerate the improvement of the public mind, and ultimately produce the perfect govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they vainly endeavoured to conſtruct immediately with ſuch fatal precipitation.</p>
               <p>The conſideration of ſeveral other articles of the conſtitution was continually interrupted, and not more by the variety of buſineſs, which came under the cognizance of the aſſembly, than by the want of a proper arrangement of them. Much time was loſt in diſputing about the choice of ſubjects of deliberation; and the order in which they ought to proceed. The buſineſs of the day was perpetually obliged to give place to epiſodical ſcenes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and men, who came prepared to diſcuſs one queſtion, being obliged to turn to another, loſt in ſome meaſure the benefit of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, and the energy, ſo different from the enthuſiaſm of the moment, with which a man ſupports a well digeſted opinion.</p>
               <p>Two or three ſlight debates had ariſen on the ſubject of quartering a thouſand men, of the regular troops, at Verſailles. The command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:029916_0280_0FE30C045A52A1D8"/>
of the guards had requeſted permiſſion of the municipality; pointing out the neceſſity for the ſecurity of the town, the national aſſembly, and the perſon of the king. The neceſſity did not appear ſo obvious to the public, and, in fact, the demand ſeemed calculated to provoke the tumults, againſt which they were ſo officiouſly guarding. Mirabeau alſo obſerved,
<q>that the executive power had undoubtedly a right to augment the military ſorce, in any particular place, when private information, or urgent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, appeared to require it; and that the municipality had, likewiſe, a right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the troops they judged neceſſary; yet he could not help thinking it ſingular, that the miniſters ſhould have entruſted the municipality with a ſecret, which they did not communicate to the aſſembly, who might be ſuppoſed at leaſt as anxious to take every precaution for the ſafety of the town and the king's perſon.</q>
To theſe pertinent remarks no attention was paid; and a letter from the mayor of Paris, informing the aſſembly, that a great number of the diſtricts of the metropolis had remonſtrated againſt the introduction of regular troops into Verſailles, to awe the national guards, was equally neglected; whilſt a letter to the preſident, in the name of the king, informing him that he had taken the different meaſures neceſſary to prevent any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbances in the place where the national aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly were ſitting, was thrown aſide without any comment.</p>
               <p>The loan ſtill failing, ſeveral individuals made magnificent preſents; ſacrificing their jewels and plate, to relieve the wants of their country. And
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:029916_0281_0FE30C415DF9B0D8"/>
the king ſent his rich ſervice t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the mint, in ſpite of the remonſtrances of the aſſembly.—The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs of this action, it is abſurd to talk of benevolence, may fairly be doubted; becauſe, had he eſcaped, and the eſcape was then in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, it would have been confiſcated; whilſt the voluntary offer was a popular ſtep, which might ſerve for a little time to cover this deſign, and turn the attention of the public from the ſubject of the reinforcement of the guards to the patriotiſm of the king.</p>
               <p>Theſe donations, which ſcarcely afforded a temporary ſupply, rather amuſed than relieved the nation; though they ſuggeſted a new plan to the miniſter. Necker, therefore, incapable of forming any great deſign for the good of the nation, yet calculating on the general enthuſiaſm, which pervaded all deſcriptions and ranks of people, laid before the aſſembly, the ruinous ſtate of the finances, propoſing at the ſame time, as the only mode of remedying the evil, to require of the citizens a contribution of one-fourth of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>heir income. The aſſembly was ſtartled by this propoſal, but Mirabeau believing that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would now grant whatever their repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives required, prevailed on the aſſembly, by a lively repreſentation of the perilous ſtate of the kingdom, to adopt the only plan of ſalvation which had yet been ſuggeſted—inſiſting, that this was the only expedient to avoid an infamous national bankruptcy.
<q>Two centuries of depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations and pillage,</q>
he exclaimed,
<q>have hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed out an immenſe gulph, in which the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom will ſoon be ſwallowed.</q>
It is neceſſary to fill up this frightful abyſs. Agreed!—Chooſe
<q>
                     <pb n="273" facs="unknown:029916_0282_0FE30C05DC660CD0"/>out the rich, that the ſacrifice may fall on the fewer citizens; but determine quickly! There are two thouſand notables, who have ſufficient property to reſtore order to your finances, and peace and proſperity to the kingdom. Strike; immolate without pity thoſe victims!—preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate them into the abyſs—it is going to cloſe on them—ye draw back, with horror—ye men! puſillanimous and inconſiſtent!—and ſee ye not in decreeing a bankruptcy, or, which is ſtill more contemptible, rendering it inevitable, ye are ſullied by an act a thouſand times more criminal?</q>
               </p>
               <p>But it is impoſſible to do juſtice to this burſt of eloquence, in a traſlation; beſides, the moſt energetic appeals to the paſſions always loſes half their dignity, or, perhaps, appear to want the ſupport of reaſon, when they are coolly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed—Nothing produces conviction like paſſion— it ſeems the ray from heaven, that enlightens as it warms.—Yet the effect once over, ſomething like a fear of having been betrayed into folly clings to the mind it has moſt ſtrongly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced; and an obſcure ſenſe of ſhame lowers the ſpirits that were wound up too high.</p>
               <p>From the whole tenor of this ſpeech it is clear, that Mirabeau was in earneſt; and that he had fired his imagination, by conſidering this plan as an act of heroiſm, that would ennoble the revolution, and reflect laſting honour on the national aſſembly. In this extemporary flow of eloquence, probably the moſt ſimple and noble of modern times, he mixed none of the rhetoric which frequently entered into his ſtudied com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; for his periods were often artfully
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:029916_0283_0FE30C4328FB64E0"/>
formed;—but it was the art of a man of genius. He propoſed to the aſſembly to addreſs their conſtituents on this occaſion; and he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly requeſted to prepare an addreſs for their conſideration.</p>
               <p>His addreſs to the nation is, indeed, a maſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece; yet, being written to perſuade, and not ſpoken to carry a point immediately, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm oppoſition, there is more reaſoning in it; and more artful, though leſs forcible, appeals to the paſſions. And, though this expedient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the moſt wild that folly could have blundered upon, the arguments ought to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferved with which it was gloſſed over.</p>
               <p>To expect a man to give the fourth of what he lived on; and that in the courſe of fifteen months, leaving it to him to make the eſtimate, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting that from virtue, which could only have been produced by enthuſiaſm. All the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient acts of heroiſm were excited by the ſpur <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> preſent danger; and of this kind of virtue the French were equally capable; yet, though the plan afforded them an opportunity to give a ſplendid proof of their patriotiſm, it by no means anſwered; becauſe, it being the effect rather of temper than of principle, ſelfiſhneſs had time to find a plauſible pretext to elude it; and vanity is ſeldom willing to hide its good works in the common meaſure.</p>
               <p>As the removal of the national aſſembly to Paris forms an epocha in the hiſtory of the revolution, it ſeems proper to cloſe this chapter with Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau's addreſs.</p>

The only diſtinction that awaits them, in the general wreck, will be the opprobrium they deſerve, or the uſeleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe that will corrode the inmoſt receſſes of their hearts.</q>

With what rapidity was formed the national militia, thoſe legions of citizens armed for the defence of the country, the preſervation of tranquility, and the maintenance of the laws! A generous emulation has beamed on all ſides. Villages, towns, provinces, have conſidered

their privileges as odious diſtinctions, and ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the honour of depriving themſelves of peculiar advantages, to enrich their country. You know it: time was not allowed to draw up the mutual conceſſions, dictated by a purely patriotic ſentiment, into decrees; ſo impatient was every claſs of citizens to reſtore to the great family whatever endowed ſome of it's members to the prejudice of others.</q>

The objects of luxury which thou haſt ſacrificed, have added new luſtre to thy dignity; and whilſt the love of the French for thy ſacred-per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon makes them murmur at the privation, their ſenſibility applauds thy magnanimity; and their generoſity will repay thy beneficence by the return it covets, by an imitation of thy virtues, by purſuing thy courſe in the career of public utility.</q>

How much the prudent economy of individuals might contribute to the reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kingdom!

Are we the nation to whoſe honour it's enemies bear witneſs, who are about to ſully the proud diſtinction by a BANKRUPTCY?—Shall we give them cauſe to ſay, we have only recovered our liberty and ſtrength to commit, without ſhuddering, crimes which paled even the cheek of deſpotiſm?</q>

               <p>THE taſk certainly was very difficult, at this criſis, for a miniſter to give ſatisfaction <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Still it is always the height of folly in a financier, to attempt to ſupply the exigencies of government by any but ſpecific and certain means: for ſuch vague meaſures will ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a <hi>deficit,</hi> the conſequences of which are moſt pernicious to public credit and private comfort.</p>
               <p>A man, who has a preciſe ſum to live upon, generally takes into his eſtimate of expences a certain part of his income as due to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for the protection and ſocial advantages it ſecures him. This proportion of his income be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing commonly the ſame from period to period, he lays it by for that particular purpoſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly enjoys the remainder. But, ſhould a weak miniſter, or a capricious government, call on him for an additional ſum, becauſe the taxes have proved unproductive, either through the

               <p>A man who has a limited income, and a large family, is not only obliged to be very induſtrious to ſupport them, but he i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> likewiſe neceſſitated to make all his arrangements with the greateſt circumſpection and exactneſs; becauſe a trifling loſs, by involving him in debt, might lead to his ruin, including that of his family. The rich man, indeed, ſeldom thinks of theſe moſt cruel misfortunes; for a few pounds, more or leſs, are of no real importance to him. Yet the poor man, nay even the man of moderate fortune, is liable to have his whole ſcheme of life broken by a circumſtance of this kind, and all his future days embittered by a perpetual ſtruggle with pecuniary vexations.</p>
               <p>Governments, which ought to protect, and not oppreſs mankind, cannot be too regular in their demands; for the manner of levying taxes is of the higheſt importance to political economy, and the happineſs of individuals. No govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has yet eſtabliſhed a juſt ſyſtem of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>In Holland almoſt all the taxes are collected in the ſhape of exciſe.</p>
                     <p>In France, formerly, the taxes were generally internal; but, ſince the mode eſtabliſhed of making a revenue of 300,000,000<hi>l.</hi> by the land and houſe tax part of the 580,000,000<hi>l.</hi> eſtimated to be the peace eſtabliſhment, it appears, that this was too great a proportion to be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in that way. Hence the revenue of France has lately faile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> in a great degree.</p>
                     <p>In America the taxes of the Federal government have been lately eſtabliſhed ſolely on the cuſtoms, that is to ſay, on goods imported. Theſe operate two ways; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging home manufactures, and diſcouraging the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures of other countries.</p>
                     <p>Great Britain has levied her revenue on cuſtoms both inwards and outwards; on exciſe, principally internal; on ſtamps, which operate both internally and externally; and on fixed objects, as well as internal conſumption, (as ſalt).</p>
                  </note>: for in every country the expences of
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:029916_0294_0FE30CC1F4A1FFC0"/>
government have fallen unequally on the citizens; and, perhaps, it is not poſſible to render them perfectly equal, but by laying all the taxes on land, the mother of every production.</p>
               <p>In this poſture of affairs the enthuſiaſm of the French in the cauſe of liberty might have been turned to the advantage of a new and permanent ſyſtem of finance. An able, bold miniſter, who poſſeſſed the confidence of the nation, might have recommended with ſucceſs the taking of the national property under the direct management of the aſſembly; and then endeavouring to raiſe a loan on that property, he would have given reſpectability to the new government, by imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately procuring the ſupplies indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary not only to keep it, but to put it in motion.</p>
               <p>In times of civil commotion, or during a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral convulſion, men who have money, and they are commonly moſt timid and cautious, are very apt to take care of it, even at the expence of their intereſt; and, therefore, it was to be preſumed, that the mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed men of France would not have been very ready to ſubſcribe to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:029916_0295_0FE30C8FB1F16E50"/>
loans propoſed by the miniſter, unleſs the ſecurity had been obvious, or the ſpeculative ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages exorbitant. But if Necker, whom the prudent uſurer adored as his tutelar god, had ſaid to the nation
<q>there is a property worth 4,700,000,000<hi>l.</hi> independent of the property of the emigrants, take it into your immediate poſſeſſion; and, whilſt the ſales are going on, give it as a guarantee for the loan you want. This juſt and dignified meaſure will not only relieve your preſent neceſſities, but it will be ſufficient to enable you to fulfil great part of your former engagements.</q>
There would have been then no need of the eloquence of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau; reaſon would have done the buſineſs; and men, attending to their own intereſt, would have promoted the public good, without having their heads turned giddy by romantic flights of he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſm.</p>
               <p>The immediate and inceſſant wants of a ſtate muſt always be ſupplied; prudence therefore, requires, that the directors of the finances ſhould rather provide by anticipation for its wants than ſuffer a <hi>deficit.</hi> The government being once in arrears, additional taxes become indiſpenſable to bring forward the balance, or the nation muſt have recourſe to paper notes; an expedient, as experience has ſhown, always to be dreaded, becauſe by encreaſing the debt it only extends the evil. And this increaſing debt, like a ball of ſnow, gathering as it rolls, ſoon attains a wonderful magnitude. Every ſtate, which has unavoidably accumulated its debt, ought, provided th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="287" facs="unknown:029916_0296_0FE30CC8DC7CFBE8"/>
of its citizens, to take every juſt meaſure to render the intereſt ſecure, and to fund the principal; for as it augments, like the petrifying maſs, it ſtands in the way of all improvement, ſpreading the chilling miſeries of poverty around —till the evil baffling all expedients, a mighty craſh produces a new order of things, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming with the ruins of the old, thouſands of innocent victims.</p>
               <p>The precious metals have been conſidered as the beſt of all poſſible ſigns of value to facilitate the exchange of commodities to ſupply our reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procal wants: and they will ever be neceſſary to our comfort, whilſt by the common conſent of mankind they are the ſtandard of exchange. Gold and ſilver have a ſpecific value, becauſe it is not eaſy to accumulate them beyond a certain quantity. Paper, on the contrary, is a dangerous expedient, except under a well eſtabliſhed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment: and even then the buſineſs ought to be conducted with great moderation and ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.—Perhaps it would be wiſe, that its extent ſhould be conſiſtent with the commerce of the country, and the quantity of ſpecies actually in it—But it is the ſpirit of commerce to ſtretch credit too far. The notes, alſo, which are iſſued by a ſtate before its government is well eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will certainly be depreciated; and in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they grow precarious, the gold and ſilver, which was formerly in circulation will vaniſh, and every article of trade, and all the comforts of life will bear a higher price.</p>
               <p>Theſe are conſiderations, which ought to have occured to the French miniſter, and have led him to take decided meaſures. The intereſt of
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:029916_0297_0FE30C91922AE100"/>
the national debt was 255,395,141 <hi>l.</hi> by a report for the year 1792. Necker, by his account dated the 1ſt of May, 1789, ſtates the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come at 475,294,000<hi>l.,</hi> and the expences at 531,533,000<hi>l.</hi>: conſequently there was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of 56,239,000<hi>l.</hi>; and it was not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it could not even be expected, that during the convulſions of a revolution the taxes would be regularly paid: the debt, then, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the ſtate muſt increaſe.</p>
               <p>The credit of every government greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the regulation of its finances; and the moſt certain way to have given ſtability to the new ſyſtem, would have been by making ſuch arrangements as would have inſured promptitude of payment. No miniſter ever had it ſo much in his power to have taken meaſures glorious for France, beneficial to Europe, happy for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the day, and advantageous to poſterity. No epocha ſince the inflated ſyſtem of paper (the full blown bladders of public credit, which may be deſtroyed by the prick of a pin) was invented, ever appeared ſo favourable as that juncture in France, to have overturned it completely: and by overlooking theſe circumſtances, the nation has probably loſt moſt of the advantages, which her finances might have gained by the revolution.</p>
               <p>Such miſtakes, whilſt they involve in them a thouſand difficulties, prove the neceſſity of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual reform; leſt the light ſuddenly breaking-in on a benighted people, ſhould overpower the underſtanding it ought to direct. The line in which Necker had been accuſtomed to move, by reſtraining what little energy his mind was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of exerting, precluded the poſſibility of his
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:029916_0298_0FE30CCA60D44818"/>
ſeeing the faint lines marked on an expanſive ſcale, which afforded the data for calculations; and the nation, confiding to him the direction of a buſineſs for which he had not ſufficient talents, ſeems to have contemplated in imagination a proſpect, which has not yet been realized; and whilſt expectation hovered on its margin, the dazzling ſcenery was obſcured by clouds the moſt threatening and tremendous.</p>
               <p>Theſe are evils that from the beginning of time have attended precipitate and great changes. The improvements in philoſophy and morals have been extremely tardy. All ſudden revolutions have been as ſuddenly overturned, and things thrown back below their former ſtate. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in the ſcience of politics have been ſtill more ſlow in their advancement than thoſe of philoſophy and morals; but the revolution in France has been progreſſive. It was a revolution in the minds of men; and only demanded a new ſyſtem of government to be adapted to that change. This was not generally perceived; and the politicians of the day ran wildly from one extreme to the other, without recollecting, that even Moſes ſojourning forty years in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs could but conduct the Jews to the borders of the promiſed land, after the firſt generation had periſhed in their prejudices; the moſt inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate ſins of men.</p>
               <p>This is not a diſcouraging conſideration. Our anceſtors have laboured for us; and we, in our turn, muſt labour for poſterity. It is by tracing the miſtakes, and profiting from the diſcoveries of one generation, that the next is able to take a more elevated ſtand. The firſt inventor of any
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:029916_0299_0FE30C9314220998"/>
inſtrument has ſcarcely ever been able to bring it to a tolerable degree of perfection; and the diſcoveries of every man of genius, the optics of Newton excepted, have been improved, if not extended, by their followers.—Can it then be expected, that the ſcience of politics and ſinance, the moſt important, and moſt difficult of all human improvements; a ſcience which involves the paſſions, tempers, and manners of men and nations, eſtimates their wants, maladies, comforts, happineſs, and miſery, and computes the ſum of good or evil flowing from ſocial inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions; will not require the ſame gradations, and advance by ſteps equally ſlow to that ſtate of perfection neceſſary to ſecure the ſacred rights of every human creature?</p>
               <p>The vanity and weakneſs of men have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually tended to retard this progreſs of things: ſtill it is going forward; and though the fatal preſumption of the headſtrong French, and the more deſtructive ambition of their foreign ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, have given it a check, we may contemplate with complacent ſerenity the approximation of the glorious era, when the appellations of fool and tyrant will be ſynonymous.</p>

               <p>THE conduct of the aſſembly in loſing ſo much time—the moſt precious time to ſecure the happineſs of their country, and enable the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent generation to participate in the bleſſings they were preparing for poſterity, inſtead of having to encounter all the miſeries of anarchy, can never be ſufficiently lamented. France had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready gained her freedom; the nation had already aſcertained certain, and the moſt important, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:029916_0301_0FE30C9524C03400"/>
truths: it ought, therefore, to have been the next conſideration, how theſe were to be preſerved, and the liberty of the empire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidated on a baſis that time would only render more firm.</p>
               <p>Moderate men, or real patriots, would have been ſatisfied with what had been gained, for the preſent, allowing the reſt to follow progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively. It was the moſt political and the moſt reaſonable way to ſecure the acquiſition. In this ſituation France had to contend with the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of half Europe, at leaſt, and to counteract the influence of the inſidious intriguers, who were oppoſing themſelves to her regeneration; to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate which the aſſembly ought to have made it one of their main objects to render the king contented with the change; and then the machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of all the underminers of the revolution, would not have looſened one fundamental ſtone, to endanger the riſing edifice.</p>
               <p>Such is the difference between men acting from a practical knowledge, and men who are governed entirely by theory, or no principle whatever. Moſt of the United States of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica formed their ſeparate conſtitutions within a month, and none took more than three, after the declaration of their independence by congreſs. There certainly was a vaſt diſtinction between thoſe ſtates, then the colonies of Great Britain, and France after the 14th of July; but both countries were without a government. America with an enemy in the heart of their empire, and France threatened with an attack. The leading men of America, however, knew, that there was a neceſſity of having ſome kind of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:029916_0302_0FE30C52D5BDEEE8"/>
and ſeem to have perceived the eaſe, with which any ſubſequent alterations could be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The members of the national aſſembly, on the contrary, found themſelves ſurrounded with ruins; and aiming at a ſtate of perfection for which the minds of the people were not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently mature; affecting likewiſe to be directed by a magnanimous diſinte reſtedneſs, they not only planted the germ of the moſt dangerous and licentious ſpirit, but they continued to irritate the deſperate courtiers, who, having determined to oppoſe ſtratagem to force, and not ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reſted all their future hopes on the king's eſcape.</p>
               <p>The liberty of the preſs, which had been vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually eſtabliſhed, at this period, was a ſucceſsful engine employed againſt the aſſembly. And to a nation celebrated for epigramatic fancy, and whoſe taſte had been ſo refined by art, that they had loſt the zeſt of nature, the ſimplicity of ſome of the members, their awkward figures, and ruſtic gait, compared with the courtly mien, and eaſy aſſurance of the chevaliers of Verſailles, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded an excellent ſubject. Some of theſe ſatires were written with conſiderable wit, and ſuch a happy turn of caricature, that it is impoſſible not to laugh with the author, though indirectly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculing the principles you hold ſacred. The moſt reſpectable decrees, the moſt important, and ſerious diſcuſſions, were twiſted into jeſts; which divided the people without doors into two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct parties; one, ſpeaking of the aſſembly with ſovereign contempt, as a ſet of upſtarts and bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling knaves; and the other, ſetting up new thrones for their favourites, and viewing them
<pb n="294" facs="unknown:029916_0303_0FE30C9BB1E81F80"/>
with blind admiration, as if they were a ſynod of demi-gods. The countenancing of this abuſe of freedom was ill-judged. The different parties were already ſufficiently heated; yet it would have been impoſſible, perhaps, to have reſtrained the temper of the times, ſo ſtrong is the intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a new folly, though it would have been eaſy for the aſſembly to have paſſed a decree re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting libels. But ſo ardent was become their paſſion for liberty, that they were unable to diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate between a licentous uſe of that important invention, and it's real utility. Treating then with an untimely diſdain the many abuſive publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, which were ſold within the very walls where they were ſitting, they were not aware of the effect which they produced on the minds of mock heroes, who, having no principle but honour, were ready to riſk their lives to ſooth diſtreſſed beauty, no matter what produced it; or to alleviate the ſufferings of a king, though the conſequence of his turpitude or tergiverſation.</p>
               <p>After the wreck of a government the plan of a new conſtitution ought to be immediately form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that is, as ſoon as circumſtances will poſſibly admit, and preſented to the citizens for their acceptance; or rather the people ſhould depute men for that purpoſe, and give them a limited time for framing one. A conſtitution is a ſtandard for the people to rally round. It is the pillar of a government, the bond of all ſocial unity and order. The inveſtigation of it's principles makes it a fountain of light; from which iſſue the rays of reaſon, that gradually bring forward the mental powers of the whole community. And when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the wheels of government, like the wheels
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:029916_0304_0FE30CCE1715FD08"/>
of any other machine, are found clogged, or do not move in a regular manner, they equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire alteration and improvement: and theſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements will be proportionably perfect as the people become enlightened.</p>
               <p>The authority of the national aſſembly had been acknowledged nearly three months previous to this epocha, without their having taken any decided ſteps to ſecure theſe important ends. Indeed it does not appear to have been their firſt object. They ſeem not have known, or at leaſt not to have been apprehenſive, that, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the length of time that the people are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an eſtabliſhed government, anarchiſts gain an aſcendency over their minds; and it then becomes no eaſy taſk to form a conſtitution adapted to their wayward tempers.</p>

It is true, that many of the prejudices of Frenchmen were ſtill inveterate, and in ſome meaſure influenced them; and it is alſo certain, that their total ignorance of the operations of any rational ſyſtem of government was an impediment to this motion; but it is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs to be preſumed, that, the liberty of French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men having been previouſly ſecured by the eſtabliſhment of the declaration of rights, if the aſſembly had formed ſome kind of a conſtitution, and propoſed it to the nation, and to the king, if he were conſidered as forming a part of it, for their acceptation, the diſpute between the people and court would have been brought to a ſpeedy

iſſue; and the public attention directed to a point would have given dignity and reſpectability to their proceedings.

indiviſible, was the moſt idle, if not the moſt dangerous meaſure, both for him and France, which could have been deviſed. The former life of Louis had exhibited a ſeries of follies, and diſplayed an inſincerity not to be tolerated, much leſs encouraged; and it was likely, if this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, a relict of the abaſement of ignorance, that kings can do no wrong, ſhould not be carried into a law, forming part of the conſtitution, that he would avail himſelf of the decree of the aſſembly to cover his contempt of the national ſovereignty. When kings are conſidered by the government of a country merely as cyphers, it is very juſt and proper, that their miniſters ſhould be reſponſible for their political conduct: but at the moment when a ſtate is about to eſtabliſh a conſtitution on the baſis of reaſon, to undermine that foundation by a maſter-piece of abſurdity, appears a ſoleciſm as glaring as the doct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is laughable, when applied to an enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed policy. In fact, whilſt Mirabeau contended for the infallibility of the king, he ſeems to have had no right from reaſon to deride thoſe who reſpected that of the church: for, if the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt neceſſarily be ſupported by a pious fraud, one was as reſpectable as the other.</p>
               <p>The bigotry of Louis was well known; nay, it was notorious, that he employed his confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to eraſe from his tender conſcience the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the vices he reſolved to indulge, and to reconcile the meaneſt diſſimulation with a fertile fear of the Being whoſe firſt attribute is truth.—This man, whoſe beſtiality had been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully pampered by the queen and count d'Arto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This was the extreme folly of weakneſs. But, when it is alſo kept in view, that, at the very period when he was declared inviolable, he was ſuſpected, in concert with the court, to be actually meditating his flight, there ſeems to be a puſillanimity in it as contemptible as the pretended dignity of the aſſembly was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</p>
               <p>True firmneſs conſiſts in doing whatever is juſt and reaſonable, uninfluenced by any other conſideration. The defining the power of the crown in the aſſembly to be ſubordinate to the authority of the people muſt have appeared to the kings of Europe a dangerous encroachment on their indefeaſible rights:—a hereſy tending to undermine their privileges, ſhould ſuch audacity paſs unchaſtized, and to deſtroy the ſplendor of royalty by preſuming to controul its omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence. It was then ſcarcely to be expected, that their reſentment would be appeaſed by ſhielding the perſon of Louis againſt the danger of intrigue and violence. It was not, indeed, the preſervation of the life of this unfortunate man, that intereſted them ſo ſenſibly as to appal the ſychophants of Europe.—No; it was the attack made on deſpotiſm; and the attempt to draw aſide the ſplendid cur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The effect of the feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or real pity of many of the admirers of the old ſyſtem, who were deeply wounded by the wrong done, as they inſiſted, to their king, was to be dreaded; for it was not to be ſuppoſed, that the chivalrous ſpirit of France would be deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troyed in an inſtant, though <hi>ſwords had ceaſed to leap out of their ſcabbards</hi> when beauty was not deified.

Beſides, had the repreſentatives of the people conſidered Louis merely as a man, it is probable he would have acted more like one. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of palliating the matter, they ſhould, on the contrary, have proclaimed to all Europe, with a tone of dignified firmneſs, that the French nation, willing for themſelves, regardleſs of the rights and privileges of others, though reſpecting their prejudices, finding that no compromiſe could be formed between the court and people, whoſe
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:029916_0309_0FE30CA0D5F85808"/>
intereſt neither juſtice nor policy ever required ſhould be diſtinct, do not conſider themſelves accountable to any power or congreſs on earth, for any meaſure they may chooſe to adopt in framing a conſtitution to regulate their own internal polity. That, treating their monarch like a man, and not as a mere idol for ſtate pageantry, they would wiſh, by eſtabliſhing the dignity of truth and juſtice, to give ſtability to the freedom of Frenchmen, and leave a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument in their inſtitutions to immortalize a ſincere and acquieſcing king. But that, though their ideas might differ greatly from thoſe of their neighbours, with whom they deſired to live on the moſt amicable terms, they would purſue the path of eternal reaſon in conſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dating the rights of man; and by a ſtriking example lay the foundation of the liberty of the whole globe, of that liberty which had hitherto been confined to the ſmall iſland of England, and enjoyed imperfectly even there.</p>
               <p>The houſe of Auſtria was at this period en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a war with the Turks, which obliged it to withdraw moſt of its troops from Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and the intelligence, that the Flemings, highly diſcontented with the innovations, which the vain weathercock Joſeph the Second had made in their form of worſhip, were on the eve of an inſurrection, more againſt the folly of the man than the deſpotiſm of his court, calmed the fears of the French, as to the danger of being immediately attacked by Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. This ſecurity, for they had no dread of Sardinia, made them conſider the poſſibility of a counter-revolution being effected by foreign
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:029916_0310_0FE30C8850B7FBC8"/>
enemies as far from alarming. It is true, there was not any juſt cauſe of apprehenſion, unleſs they took into the calculation, that the policy of Europe for ages paſt had been ſubject to ſudden changes; a ſtate of profound tranquillity giving place to ſanguinary ſcenes of confuſion, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human butcheries—often about ſuch trifling inſults and idle pretenſions, as individuals would be aſhamed to make a pretext for quarrelling; and having reaſon to expect theſe changes as long as the ſyſtems of courts preſerve their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence, France could not reckon, with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of certainty, on the continuation of peace. —Neither did the national aſſembly appear to have calculated upon it; for they undoubtedly betrayed ſymptoms of puſillanimity, when they ſuffered their conduct to be in the ſmalleſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree influenced by the apprehenſion of a combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the crowned heads of Europe to replace the royal diadem of France, ſhould the moſt brilliant of it's jewels be touched by profane hands.</p>
               <p>Theſe fears, perhaps, were the ſecret cauſe, combined with the old habit of adoring the king, as a point of honour, and loving the court, as an affair of taſte, that induced them to preſerve the ſhadow of monarchy in the new order of things. Its preſervation might have been politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally neceſſary; becauſe, before aboliſhing any ancient form, it is neceſſary to ſecure, whatever political good may have flowed from it, and guard againſt being exhauſted by cutting off an excreſcence.—But, if the continuance of a king in the new ſyſtem were expedient to avert preſent evil, they ſhould have allowed him the
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:029916_0311_0FE30C89D513FB18"/>
power neceſſary to give energy to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and making him reſponſible for the recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his actions, the man would have had a fair trial, and poſterity, judging of his conduct, would have been enabled to form a juſt eſtimate of a kingly government.</p>
               <p>Machiavelian cunning, however, ſtill directed the movements of all the courts of Europe; and theſe political moles, too well perceiving the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity that was mixed with the bluſtering courage of the aſſembly, only waited for a favourble ſeaſon to overturn the riſing edifice. Their agents had private inſtructions to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the eſcape of Louis, as the ſureſt mode of making a decided ſchiſm in the national politics; and they firmly believed, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſtill ſubſiſting for his chriſtian majeſty would facilitate the execution of their plan. The court alſo preſuming on the diviſions and lenity of the aſſemb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y, took the moſt indefatigable pains to foſter in the mind of the public, nay, in that of all Europe, pity for the degraded perſon of the king, and deteſtation of the ſacrilege, which had been committed on the dignity of royalty. Their continual theme was the ignomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious ſtate to which the moſt mild of the Bourbons was reduced, by men, who uſurped the reins of government, and trampled on the honours of that auguſt and ancient family. Reſtraining the authority of a throne, which ſupported the moſt abominable tyranny, they were ſhaking the deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which held in bondage nine-tenths of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the world. Theſe were alarming ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals to a certain claſs of men, to the drones and myrmidons who live on the ſpoil and blood of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:029916_0312_0FE30CD70987DD78"/>
and innocence. The intruſion of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which was ſure to render them an uſeleſs ſet of beings in ſociety, was to be prevented by inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious clamours, whilſt a great number of weak, well-meaning people, and ſtill more knaves, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted under their banner.</p>
               <p>The univerſal damp, which the revolution had given to the courts of Europe, producing among them a lively ſympathy for the ſombre atmoſphere of Verſailles, a general ſorrow was conſequently expreſſed by all their minions, and expreſſed with unfeigned concern; for the want of the uſual routine of amuſements tended to make it real. Hope, indeed, began again to animate them, when the king was prevailed on to concert his eſcape; yet their eagerneſs to accelerate his departure for the frontiers, where they propoſed to erect the royal ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard, to avail themſelves of the promixity of German connections, was in a great degree the the cauſe of defeating that ill contrived de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.</p>
               <p>A deſign formed very early, and ſyſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally purſued, was probably rendered entirely abortive by the obſtinacy of the court; who ſtill perſiſted to cheriſh the belief, that the public opinion was changed only for the moment, and that their deeply rooted love of royalty would bring them back to what they termed their duty, when the efferveſcence excited by novelty had ſubſided. And thinking, that the cordial reception given by the Pariſians to the ſoldiery had contributed to eſtrange them, and effect the revolution, they determined to regain their loſt ground, and dazzle them by feaſts,
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:029916_0313_0FE30CA54D76EA28"/>
inſtead of ſtealing on their affections by hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.—Still, bearing impatiently their humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating ſituation, the courtiers could not help vauntingly expoſing their project; and the bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling of joy ſhowed the weakneſs of the heads that could ſo ſoon be intoxicated by hope.</p>
               <p>A preparatory ſtep was thought neceſſary to awaken a ſenſe of allegiance in the breaſts of the people, and to promote a diviſion amongſt them, if not their entire concurrence, after the cabinet ſhould have ſecurely in their poſſeſſion the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the king; and this diviſion would then enable them to calculate their ſtrength, and act accordingly. For this purpoſe, in ſpite of the comments that had been made on the feſtivity at Verſailles, which ſeemed before to inſult the miſery of the people and greatly tended to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke the exertions that overturned the Baſtile and changed the whole face of things, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected another entertainment to ſeduce the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, encouraged to throng round the court, whilſt famine was at the very gates of Paris. But previouſly the old French guards, who had been incorporated with the <hi>garde bourgeoiſe,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to manifeſt ſome ſymptoms of diſcontent at not being allowed to guard the perſon of the king. Whether they conſidered their honour as wounded, or were ſpirited up to aſpire at regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this privilege is not decided; but it is clear, that the court, either to facilitate the entrance of freſh troops, or from a real diſlike to men, who had taken ſuch an active part in diſconcerting their firſt plot, oppoſed their wiſh; and even the municipality, as has been already noticed, was induced to requeſt, that a regiment of freſh

troops might be called in to guard the perſon of the king, and keep the peace, which this trifling diſpute, ſwelled into an inſurrection in the report, threatened to diſturb.</p>
               <p>The king's body-guards, whoſe time of ſervice expired the firſt of October, were ſtill retained with thoſe who came to replace them; and an immenſe crowd of ſupernumeraries continued daily to increaſe this corps, which had not yet ſworn allegiance to the nation. The officers, in particular, flocked to Verſailles, amounting to between eleven and twelve hundred, conſtantly parading together. The univerſal topic was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration of the king's fate, and inſinuations reſpecting the ambition of the aſſembly. Yet, even there the court party ſeemed to be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: a preſident attached to loyalty was elected; and Mirabeau's remonſtrances, reſpecting the augmentation of the troops, were diſregarded.</p>
               <p>Mean time, not only the officers of the new regiment, but thoſe of the national guards, were careſſed by the court, whilſt the citizens, with more ſagacity, were laviſh of their attention to the ſoldiers. The cabinet had not ſufficient diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment to perceive, that the people were now to be led, not driven; and the popular promoters of anarchy, to ſerve their private intereſt availed themſelves, unfortunately, but too well of this want of judgment.—Thus whilſt one party, declaiming on the neceſſity of order, ſeemed to be endeavouring to rivet on them the chains of ſervitude, the other lifted them above the law with vain glorious notions of their ſovereignty. —And this ſovereignty of the people, the perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſcience of government, only to be

               <p>ON the firſt of October, in conſequence of theſe freſh machinations, a magnificent enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment was given in the name of the king's body-guards; but really by ſome of their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officers, at the opera-houſe of the caſtle. The affectation of excluding the dragoons, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for their attachment to liberty, ſeemed to ſhow, but too plainly, the end in view, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſtill more conſpicuous by the unuſual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity of perſons of the firſt rank with the loweſt ſoldiers.</p>

The queen, to teſtify her ſatisfaction for the homage paid to her, and the wiſhes expreſſed in her favour, exhibited herſelf to this half-drunken multitude; carrying the dauphin in her arms, whom ſhe regarded with a mixture of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="308" facs="unknown:029916_0317_0FE30C57415FC2C8"/>
theatrical diſplay of ſenſibility, carried to the higheſt pitch, produced emotions almoſt convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in the whole circle, of which an Engliſh reader can ſcarcely form an idea. The king, who is always repreſented as innocent, though always giving proofs that he more than connived at the attempts to recover his power, was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe prevailed on to ſhew himſelf at this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. And ſome of the ſame ſoldiery, who had refuſed to ſecond the former project of the cabal, were now induced to utter inſults and menaces againſt the very authority, they then ſupported. 'The national cockade,' exclaimed Mirabeau,
<q>that emblem of the defenders of liberty, has been torn in pieces, and ſtamped under foot; and another enſign put into its place.—Yes; even under the eye of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, who allowed himſelf to be ſtyled— <hi>Reſtorer of the rights of his people,</hi> they have dared to hoiſt a ſignal of faction.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame ſcene was renewed two days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though with leſs parade; and invitations for a ſimilar treat were given for the following week.</p>
               <p>The rumour reſpecting them, which reached Paris, contained many exaggerated circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and was regarded as the commencement of freſh hoſtilities, on the part of the court. The cry now was, that the ſtunned ariſtocracy had again reared it's head; and that a number of old officers, chevaliers of St. Louis, had ſigned a a promiſe to join the body-guards in a new at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. This liſt was ſaid to contain thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſignatures; and idle as the tale was, it ſeemed to be confirmed by the appearance of white and
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:029916_0318_0FE30CE2296EC408"/>
black cockades, which inconſiderate individuals diſplayed at the riſk of their lives. Theſe, ſaid the Pariſians, are the firſt indications of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected civil war—the court wiſh only to have the king ſafe to head them before they ſpeak out:— he ought, therefore, to be removed to Paris, inferred the politicians of the palais royal. The exaſperating of the people in this manner was certainly the moſt abſurd blundering folly that could have ruined a party, who apparently ſaw the neceſſity of dividing the people in order to conquer them. It was, in fact, a ſpecies of madneſs, and can be accounted for only by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting the ineffable contempt really felt by the court for the <hi>canaille,</hi> which made them ſtill imagine the revolution to be only a temporary convulſion, not believing it poſſible, in ſpite of the daily events, that they could be cruſhed by the maſs they deſpiſed. Their preſumption pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from their ignorance, and was incurable.</p>
               <p>The queen was ſuppoſed to be at the head of this weak conſpiracy, to withdraw the ſoldiery from ſiding with the people. She had preſented colours to the national guards of Verſailles, and when they waited on her to expreſs their thanks, ſhe replied, with the moſt winning affability,
<q>the nation and the army ought to be as well affected to the king as we ourſelves are. I was quite charmed with what paſſed on Thurſday.</q>
This was the day of the feaſt.</p>
               <p>A ſcarcity of bread, the common grievance of the revolution, aggravated the vague fears of the Pariſians, and made the people ſo deſperate, that it was not difficult to perſuade them to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:029916_0319_0FE30CA9189C81B0"/>
any enterprize; and the torrent of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and enthuſiaſm required only to be directed to a point to carry every thing before it. Liberty was the conſtant watch-word; though few knew in what it conſiſted.—It ſeems, indeed, to be neceſſary, that every ſpecies of enthuſiaſm ſhould be fermented by ignorance to carry it to any height. Myſtery alone gives full play to the imagination, men purſuing with ardor objects indiſtinctly ſeen or underſtood, becauſe each man ſhapes them to his taſte, and looks for ſomething beyond even his own conception, when he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to form a juſt idea.</p>
               <p>The Pariſians were now continually brooding over the wrongs they had heretofore only enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated in a ſong; and changing ridicule into invective, all called for redreſs, looking for a degree of public happineſs immediately, which could not be attained, and ought not to have been expected, before an alteration in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional character ſeconded the ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>From the enjoyment of more freedom than the women of other parts of the world, thoſe of France have acquired more independence of ſpirit than any others; it has, therefore, been the ſcheme of deſigning men very often ſince the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, to lurk behind them as a kind of ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, working them up to ſome deſperate act, and then terming it a folly, becauſe merely the rage of women, who were ſuppoſed to be actuated only by the emotions of the moment. Early then on the fifth of October a multitude of women by ſome impulſe were collected together; and haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:029916_0320_0FE30CE3AADF8A48"/>
to the <hi>Hôtel-de-Ville</hi> obliged every female they met to accompany them, even entering many houſes to force others to follow in their train.</p>
               <p>The concourſe, at firſt, conſiſted moſtly of market women, and the loweſt refuſe of the ſtreets, women who had thrown off the virtues of one ſex without having power to aſſume more than the vices of the other. A number of men alſo followed them, armed with pikes, bludgeons, and hatchets; but they were ſtrictly ſpeaking a mob, affixing all the odium to the appellation it can poſſibly import; and not to be confounded with the honeſt multitude, who took the Baſtile. —In fact, ſuch a rabble has ſeldom been gathered together; and they quickly ſhowed, that their movement was not the effect of public ſpirit.</p>
               <p>They firſt talked of addreſſing the committee appointed by the municipality to ſuperintend the operations neceſſary to obtain proviſion for the city, and to remonſtrate reſpecting their inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or indifference to the public calamity. Mean time a new cord was fixed to the notorious lamp-iron, where the amuſement of death was firſt tolerated. The national guards, forming a hedge of bayonets to prevent the women from entering the hotel, kept them in ſuſpenſe a few moments. — When uttering a loud and general cry, they hurled a volley of ſtones at the ſoldiers, who, unwilling, or aſhamed, to fire on women, though with the appearance of furies, retreated into the hall, and left the paſſage free. They then ſought for arms; and breaking open the doors of the magazines, ſoon procured fuſils, cannons and ammunition; and even took advantage of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion to carry off money and notes belonging to
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:029916_0321_0FE30CAA99F61670"/>
the public. In the interim ſome went to ſearch for the volunteers of the Baſtile, and choſe a commander from among them to conduct the party to Verſailles; whilſt others tied cords to the carriages of the cannons to drag them along. —But theſe, being moſtly marine artillery, did not follow with the alacrity neceſſary to accord with their wiſhes; they, therefore, ſtopped ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral coaches, forcing the men to get out and the ladies to join them; faſtening the cannons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, on which a number of the moſt furious mounted, brandiſhing whatever weapon they had found, or the matches of the cannons. Some drove the horſes, and others charged themſelves with the care of the powder and ball, falling into ranks to facilitate their march. They took the road by the <hi>Champs Eliſées</hi> about noon, to the number of four thouſand, eſcorted by four or five hundred men, armed with every thing on which they could lay their hand.</p>
               <p>Mean time the <hi>tocſin</hi> ſounded from all parts; the French guards, ſtill urged on by wounded pride, loudly declared, that the king ought to be brought to Paris; and many of the citizens, not on duty, concurred with the reſt of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional guards in the ſame opinion, particularly thoſe accuſtomed to attend the harangues at the Palais Royal. La Fayette, refuſing to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, endeavoured to calm them. But finding, that the tumult increaſed, and that prayers were giving place to menaces, he offered to make known to the king, at their head, the wiſhes of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, if the municipality gave him orders to this effect. Their council was now aſſembled: yet prolonging the deliberation till between four
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:029916_0322_0FE30C64549EC730"/>
and five o'clock in the afternoon, the people be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo very impatient, that it was thought pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to allow them to ſet out: and the exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the populace proved how eaſy it was to govern, or lead them aſtray, by every freſh hope.</p>
               <p>Few events have happened at Paris, that have not been attributed by the different parties to the machinations of the leaders on the other ſide; to blacken whoſe characters, when they had the upper hand, the moſt audacious falſehoods have been induſtriouſly circulated; the detection of which has induced many calm obſervers to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that all the accounts of plots and conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies were fabricated in the ſame manner; not conſidering, that even the univerſality of theſe ſuſpicions was a proof of the intriguing character of the people, who from a knowledge of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves became thus miſtruſtful of others. It was currently reported, that very conſiderable ſums had been diſtributed amongſt the mob, before it marched to Verſailles; and, though many fabu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtories of ſhowers of gold have ſince been retailed by the credulous, this ſeems, from their ſubſequent conduct, to have had ſome foundation: for nothing like the heroiſm, the diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, appeared, which in moſt other riſings of the Pariſians, has formed a ſtriking contraſt with their barbarity; ſometimes ſufficient to oblige us, lamenting the deluſions of ignorance, to give the ſoft name of enthuſiaſm to cruelty; reſpecting the intention, though deteſting the effects. Now, on the contrary, acting like a gang of thieves, they gave colour to the report—that the firſt inſtigators of the riot were hired aſſaſſins.—And
<pb n="314" facs="unknown:029916_0323_0FE30CB1EAB113C0"/>
hired by whom?—The public voice repeats, on every ſide, the deſpicable duke of Orleans, whoſe immenſe eſtate had given him an undue influence in the bailliages, and who ſtill exerciſed all the means that cunning could deviſe, and wealth produce, to revenge himſelf on the royal family. He was particularly incenſed againſt the queen, who having treated him with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt which he doubtleſs merited, and even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced the king to baniſh him to one of his country ſeats, when he uttered ſome popular ſentiments, he continued to nouriſh the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable hatred to her perſon, whilſt the changing ſentiments of the nation reſpecting the preſent branch of his family excited in him hopes, that would at once have gratified both his revenge and his ambition.</p>
               <p>There is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o calculating the miſchief which may be produced by a revengeful cunning knave, poſſeſſing the forcible engine of gold to move his projects, and acting by agency, which, like a ſubterraneous fire, that for a long time has been putting the combuſtible matter into a ſtate of fuſion, burſts out unexpectedly, and the ſudden eruption ſpreads around terror and deſtruction.</p>
               <p>The agents of deſpotiſm, and of vengeful am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, employed the ſame means to agitate the minds of the Pariſians; and covered as they now are with foul ſtains, it is an acknowledgment due to their original good diſpoſition, to note, that at this period they were ſo orderly it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired conſiderable management to lead them into any groſs irregularity of conduct. It was, therefore, neceſſary for the duke's inſtruments to
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:029916_0324_0FE30CE52CA66B80"/>
put in motion a body of the moſt deſperate women; ſome of whom were half famiſhed for want of bread, which had purpoſely been render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſcarce to facilitate the atrocious deſign of murdering both the king and queen in a broil, that would appear to be produced ſolely by the rage of famine.</p>
               <p>The ſhameleſs manner in which the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the officers of the body guards had been conducted; the indiſcreet viſit of the queen to intereſt the army in the cauſe of royalty, coming in artfully after the rabble of ſoldiers had been allowed to enter; together with the imprudent expreſſions of which ſhe afterwards made uſe; ſerved as pretexts, nay, may have been ſome of the cauſes of theſe women ſuſpecting, that the dearth of bread in the capital was owing to the contrivance of the court, who had ſo often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſame effect to promote their ſiniſter purpoſes. They believed then, that the only ſure way to remedy ſuch a grievous calamity, in future, would be to emplore the king to reſide at Paris: and the national militia, compoſed of more orderly citizens, who thought the report of a premedita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted eſcape was not without foundation, imagined, that they ſhould nip a civil war in the bud, by preventing the king's departure, and ſeparate him effectually from the cabal, to whom they attributed all his miſconduct.</p>
               <p>Whilſt the multitude were advancing, the aſſembly were conſidering the king's reply to their requeſt to ſanction the declaration of rights, and the firſt articles of the conſtitution, before the ſupplies were granted. The reply was couched in terms ſomewhat vague, yet its mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="316" facs="unknown:029916_0325_0FE30CB3AA5EF838"/>
could not be miſunderſtood. He obſerved, that the articles of the conſtitution could be judged of only in their connection with the whole; nevertheleſs he thought it natural, that at the moment the nation was called upon to aſſiſt the government by a ſignal act of confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and patriotiſm, they ſhould expect to be re-aſſured reſpecting their principal intereſt.— 'Accordingly,' he continues,
<q>taking it for granted, that the firſt articles of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which you have preſented to me, united to the completion of your labours, will ſatisfy the wiſhes of my people, and ſecure the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and proſperity of the kingdom, conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to your deſire I accept them; but with one poſitive condition, from which I will never depart; namely, that from the general reſult of your deliberations the executive power ſhall have its entire effect in the hands of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch. Still it remains for me to aſſure you with frankneſs, that, if I give my ſanction of acceptance to the ſeveral articles, which you have laid before me, it is not becauſe they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately give me an idea of perfection; but I believe it laudable in me to pay this reſpect to the wiſhes of the deputies of the nation, and to the alarming circumſtances, which ſo earneſtly preſs us to deſire above all things the prompt re-eſtabliſhment of peace, order, and confidence.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>I ſhall not deliver my ſentiments reſpecting your declaration of the rights of man and of citizens. It contains excellent maxims proper to direct your deliberations; but principles ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of application, and even of different
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:029916_0326_0FE30CECA0AA1368"/>
interpretations, cannot be juſtly appreciated, and have only need of being ſo when their true ſenſe is determined by the laws, to which they ought to be the baſis.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the ſubterfuge employed in this anſwer, the profound diſſimulation of the king appears; and that 'pitiful reſpect for falſe honour,' which makes a man boggle at a naked untruth, even when uttering a number of contemptible preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rications. Thus did he at firſt ſtruggle againſt every conceſſion, againſt granting any real free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the people; yet afterwards unable to maintain his ground, he impotently gave way before the ſtorm he had raiſed, every time loſing a part of the authority which depended on opinion.</p>
               <p>The aſſembly manifeſted an univerſal diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. One of the members remarked, that the king with-held his acceptance of the declaration of rights; and only yielded to circumſtances in accepting the conſtitutional articles: he, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, moved, that no taxes ſhould be levied, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the declaration of rights and the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhould be accepted, without any reſervation. —Another aſſerted that the king's reply ought to have been counter-ſigned by one of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. What an abſurdity! yet the inviolability of the king ſtanding in their way, it ſeemed to be neceſſary to ſecure miniſterial reſponſiblity, to render it null; not only to prevent the miniſters from finding ſhelter behind it, but to make it utterly uſeleſs to the king, who was thus, literally ſpeaking, reduced to a cypher. Mirabeau, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, after alluding with energy to the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, out of deriſion had been termed
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:029916_0327_0FE30CB52D1F1620"/>
patriotic, made three or four motions. One was,
<q>that no act emanating from the king ſhould be declared without the ſignature of a ſecretary of ſtate.</q>
—So inconſiſtent was the man, who argued with ſuch eloquence for the abſolute <hi>veto:</hi> —Another was,
<q>that his majeſty would pleaſe to be explicit; and not by a conditional conſent, extorted by circumſtances, leave any doubt of his ſincere concurrence in the mind of the people.</q>
It was alſo noticed, to corroborate the inference, that the king was only yielding, for the moment, to opinions which he hoped to ſee exploded, that the decree for the circulation of grain had been altered before the publication, and the uſual preamble, <hi>for ſuch is our pleaſure,</hi> formed a ſtrange contraſt with an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the legiſlative rights of the nation. Robeſpierre, particularly maintained, that the nation had not any need of the aſſiſtance of the monarch to conſtitute itſelf—that the king's reply was not an acceptance, but a cenſure: and, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, an attack on the rights of the people.</p>
               <p>This ſeemed virtually the opinion of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, though Mirabeau's ſoft ſtyle of expreſſing their will was adopted. It was particularly in this deciſion, that the deputies diſplayed a great degree of the weakneſs, which miſtakes temerity for courage, and the ſhadow of juſtice for verity. —And affecting to reconcile a contradiction, that the authority of kings is ſuſpended as often as the ſovereign is occupied in framing the clements of the conſtitution, or altering funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental laws, they demonſtrated the inconſiſtency of their own ſyſtem and acknowledged its ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity; which is ſtill more flagrantly ſhewn in
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:029916_0328_0FE30CEE46A91BD0"/>
Mirabeau's irrational declaration, that,
<q>by a pious fiction of the law, the king cannot him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf deceive; but the grievances of the people demanding victims, theſe victims are the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</q>

               <p>At this juncture of the debate the tumultuous concourſe of women arrived at Verſailles: but it muſt not be unnoticed, that there was a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men with them, diſguiſed in women's clothes; which proves, that this was not, as has been aſſerted, a ſudden impulſe of neceſſity. There were beſides men in their own garb armed like ruffians, with countenances anſwerable, who, ſwearing vengeance againſt the queen and the body-guards, ſeemed to be preparing to put their threats in execution. Some barbarians, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers in guilt might perhaps have joined, ſpurred on ſolely by the hope of plunder, and a love of tumult; but it is clear, that the principal movers played a ſurer game.</p>
               <p>The women had taken two routes; and one party, without arms, preſented themſelves at the gate of the aſſembly, whilſt the other cluſtered round the palace waiting for them. The avenues were already filled with body-guards, the Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders regiment was drawn up in ranks; in ſhort, the ſoldiers were gathered together quickly in one quarter, though the people of Verſailles were exceedingly alarmed, and particularly by the appearance of the vagabonds, who followed the female mob.</p>
               <p>With ſome difficulty the women were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to allow a few to enter orderly into the aſſembly, with a ſpokeſman to make known their demand; whilſt crowds, taking refuge in
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:029916_0329_0FE30C65D6364B68"/>
the galleries from the rain, preſented there the ſtrange ſight of pikes, fuſils, and tremendous ſticks bound with iron. Their orator repreſented the grievances of the people, and the neceſſity of continually providing for their ſubſiſtence; he expreſſed the concern of the Pariſians on account of the ſlow formation of a conſtitution, and attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted this delay to the oppoſition of the clergy A biſhop then preſided in the abſence of Mou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nier, the preſident, who had been diſpatched by the aſſembly with their expoſtulatory petition to the king. A deputy, to ſpare him the embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a reply to the inſinuation againſt his order, reprimanded the petitioner for calumniat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that reſpectable body. He accordingly made an apology, yet juſtified himſelf by declaring, that he only reported the purport of the diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Paris. They were informed, in reply by the vice-preſident, that a deputation was already ſent to the king, requeſting his ſanction of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to facilitate the interior circulation of grain and flour: and finding, that it was impoſſible to attend to the buſineſs of the day, he adjourned the aſſembly, without waiting for the return of the preſident.</p>
               <p>The women about the palace entered into converſation with the ſoldiers, ſome of whom ſaid 'that were the king to recover all his 'autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, the people would never want bread! This indiſcreet inſinuation exaſperated them; and they replied in the language, that is prover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bial for being the moſt abuſive. A fray alſo enſuing, brought on by a diſpute relative to the affair of the cockades, one of the body guards drew his ſword, which provoked a national guard
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:029916_0330_0FE30CEFDE9D91F8"/>
of Verſailles to give him a blow with his muſket, that broke his arm.</p>
               <p>The national troops were eager to convince the mob, that they were equally offended at the diſreſpect paid to the emblem of liberty; and the Flemiſh regiment, though they were in battle array, made the women let their rings drop into their guns, to be convinced that they were not charged: ſaying,
<q>It was true, they had drunk the wine of the body guards; but what did that engage them to do? They had alſo cried <hi>vive le roi,</hi> as the people themſelves did every day; and it was their intention to ſerve him faithfully,</q>
but not againſt the nation!— with other ſpeeches to the ſame effect;—adding,
<q>that one of their officers had ordered a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand cockades; and they knew not why they were not diſtributed!</q>
Enraged by the tenor of this diſcourſe, a body-guards-man ſtruck one of the ſoldiers talking thus, who, in return, fired on him, and fractured his arm. All was now confuſion; and every thing tended to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the body guards more odious to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace.</p>
               <p>The king arrived in the midſt of it from hunting, and admitted at the ſame time the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation from the national aſſembly, and an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs from the women. He received the latter with great affability, teſtified his ſorrow on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſcarcity of bread at Paris, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſanctioned the decree, relative to the free circulation of grain, which he had juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the aſſembly. The woman who ſpoke, attempting to kiſs his hand, he embraced <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>er with politeneſs, and diſmiſſed them in the
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:029916_0331_0FE30CB75D1E0A60"/>
moſt gentleman-like manner. They immediately rejoined their companions, charmed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception they had met with; and the king ſent orders to the guards not to make uſe of their arms. The count d'Eſtaing, the commander in chief, announced likewiſe to the militia of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſailles, that the body-guards would the next day take the oath of allegiance to the nation, and put on the patriotic cockade.
<q>They are not worthy,</q>
was the indignant growl of the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
               <p>Some women now returning to Paris, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the gracious behaviour of the king, were unfortunately maltreated by a detachment of body-guards, commanded by a nobleman; and the volunteers of the Baſtile coming to their aſſiſtance, two men, and three horſes, were killed on the ſpot. Theſe ſame irritated wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men meeting, likewiſe, the Pariſian militia, on their way to Verſailles, gave them an exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerated deſcription of the conduct of the guards.</p>
               <p>The court now taking the alarm, fearing that their plan would be defeated, by the king's being obliged to go to Paris, urged him im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to ſet out for Metz, and the carriages were actually prepared. It is ſcarcely credible that they would have gone ſo far without his concurrence.</p>
               <p>One loaded coach had been permitted to go out of the gate; but the national troops beginning to ſuſpect what was going forward, obliged it to re-enter. The king then with his uſual addreſs, finding his eſcape at that time impracticable, and not wiſhing to ſhed blood in forcing his way, made a merit of neceſſity, and declared he would
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:029916_0332_0FE30CF1FAD153C8"/>
rather periſh, than ſee the blood of Frenchmen ſtreaming in his quarrel! So eaſy is it for a man, verſed in the language of duplicity, to impoſe on the credulous; and to impreſs on candid minds a belief of an opinion that they would gladly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive without any doubting allay, did not other circumſtances more ſtrongly contradict the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion. This declaration, however, which was re-echoed with great eagerneſs, was conſidered as a manifeſt proof of the purity of his intentions, and a mark of his fixed adherence to the cauſe which he affected to eſpouſe. Yet, to prove the contrary, it is only neceſſary to obſerve, that he put off the acceptance of the declaration of rights, and the firſt articles of the conſtitution, till after the attempt to eſcape was fruſtrated: for it was near eleven o'clock when he ſent for the preſident, to put into his hands a ſimple ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation, and to requeſt him to convoke the aſſembly immediately, that he might avail him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of their counſel at this criſis: alarmed by the mob without, who, expoſed to all the inclemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the weather, it being a very wet and ſtormy night, were uttering the moſt horrid imprecations againſt the queen and the body-guards.</p>
               <p>A drum inſtantly ſummoned the aſſembly; and La Fayette arriving with his army in leſs than an hour after, the preſident was again call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, who returned to the aſſembly with the king's aſſurance, that he had not even thought of leaving them, nor would he ever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate himſelf from the repreſentatives of the people.</p>
               <p>La Fayette had previouſly aſſured the king of the fidelity of the metropolis, and that he had
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:029916_0333_0FE30C7141C8F090"/>
been expreſsly ſent by the municipality of Paris to guard his auguſt perſon. A rumour had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, ever ſince the arrival of the women, that the Pariſian militia were coming to ſecond them; but as the <hi>commune</hi> of Paris had not determined till late in the afternoon, the meſſenger from La Fayette to the palace could not have reached Verſailles long before him: but the court ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that they would come, and having heard of the wiſh of the Pariſians to bring the king to Paris, where they had always ſpies to give them the earlieſt notice of what was going forward, preſſed him to ſet out without loſs of time; ſtill they were actuated ſolely by the deſire of getting him away, and not from any apprehenſion that his life was in danger.</p>
               <p>After tranquilizing the king, La Fayette join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Pariſian militia in the avenue, to inform them, that the king had ſanctioned the decree of the aſſembly for expediting the more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy circulation of proviſions, that he accepted, without any reſervation, of the declaration of rights, with the firſt articles of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, declaring at the ſame time his unſhaken reſolution to remain among his people; and that he conſented alſo to have a detachment of the national troops of Paris to contribute to guard his perſon.</p>
               <p>Joy now took place of dread at Verſailles; and the citizens diſtributed their addreſſes amongſt the ſoldiers, offering them lodgings; they having been previouſly requeſted, by the beating of a drum, to receive as many of the Pariſian mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia as they poſſibly could. The reſt, after paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral hours in arms round the palace,
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:029916_0334_0FE30CF757A2E358"/>
ſought for ſhelter, as the morning began to dawn, in the churches. Every thing appearing quiet, the haraſſed king and queen were prevailed on to ſeek the repoſe they needed; and La Fayette, about five in the morning, retired to his chamber, to write to the municipality an account of his proceedings, before he likewiſe endeavoured to match a little reſt.</p>
               <p>Scarcely an hour after, the reſtleſs mob, great part of which had taken refuge in the hall and galleries of the aſſembly, began to prowl about. The moſt decent of the women, who had been preſſed into the ſervice, ſtole away during the night. The reſt, with the whole gang of ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians, ruſhed towards the palace, and finding its avenues unguarded, entered like a torrent; and ſome among them, moſt probably, conceived that this was the moment to perpetrate the crime for which they had been drawn from their lurking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes in Paris.</p>
               <p>Inſulting one of the body-guards who op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed their entrance, he fired and killed a man. This was a freſh pretext for entering to ſearch for the murderer, as he was termed by theſe rioters; and driving the guards before them up the grand ſtair-caſe, they began to break into the different apartments, vowing vengeance againſt the body-guards, in which were mingled the bittereſt curſes, all levelled at the queen.</p>
               <p>Catching one unfortunate guard by himſelf, he was dragged down ſtairs; and his head, inſtantly ſevered from his body, was mounted on a pike, which rather ſerved to irritate than glut the fury of the monſters, who were ſtill hunting after blood or plunder.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="326" facs="unknown:029916_0335_0FE30C7D518565B8"/>The moſt deſperate found their way to the queen's chamber, and left for dead the man who courageouſly diſputed their entrance. But ſhe had been alarmed by the tumult, though the miſcreants were not long in making their way good, and, throwing a wrapping-gown around her, ran, by a private paſſage, to the king's apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where ſhe found the dauphin; but the king was gone in queſt of her: he, however, quickly returning, they waited together in a horrid ſtate of ſuſpenſe. Several of the guards, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to keep back the mob, were wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet all this happened in a very ſhort ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>The promptitude and rapidity of this move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, taking every circumſtance into conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, affords additional arguments in ſupport of the opinion, that there had been a premeditated deſign to murder the royal family. The king had granted all they aſked the evening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſending away great part of the multitude delighted with his condeſcenſion; and they had received no freſh provocation to excite this out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. The audacity of the moſt deſperate mob has never led them, in the preſence of a ſuperior force, to attempt to chaſtiſe their governors; and it is not even probable that banditti, who had been moved by the common cauſes of ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections, ſhould have thought of murdering their ſovereign who, in the eyes of the greateſt number of Frenchmen, was ſtill ſhrouded by that divinity, tacitly allowed to hover round kings, much leſs have dared to attempt it.</p>
               <p>La Fayette was quickly rouſed; and, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his <hi>aides-de-camp</hi> to aſſemble the national-guards,
<pb n="327" facs="unknown:029916_0336_0FE30C5B5C0BEE80"/>
he followed the ruffians with equal ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerity. They had actually forced the king's apartment at the moment he arrived; and the royal family were liſtening to the increaſing tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult as the harbinger of death,—when all was huſhed,—and the door opening in a moment after, the national-guards entered reſpectfully, ſaying they came to ſave the king;—
<q>and we will ſave you too gentlemen,</q>
added they, addreſſing the body-guards, who were in the chamber.</p>
               <p>The vagabonds were now purſued in their turn, and driven from room to room, in the midſt of their pillage, for they had already begun to ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack that ſumptuouſly furniſhed palace. From the palace they repaired to the ſtables, ſtill intent on plunder, and carried away ſome horſes, which were as quickly retaken. Every where they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the body-guards, and every where the generous Pariſian troops, forgetting their piqued pride and perſonal animoſity, hazarded their lives to ſave them.—Till, at length, order was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Such was the termination of this moſt myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious affair; one of the blackeſt of the machina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have ſince the revolution diſgraced the dignity of man, and ſullied the annals of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Diſappointed in their main object, theſe wretches beheaded two of the guards, who fell into their hands; and hurried away towards the metropolis, with the <hi>inſignia</hi> of their atrocity on the points of the barbarous inſtruments of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance—ſhowing in every inſtance, by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of their conduct, that they were a ſet of monſters, diſtinct from the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="unknown:029916_0337_0FE30CBD6C275840"/>Whilſt nature ſhudders at imputing to any one a plan ſo inhuman, the general character and life of the duke of Orleans warrant the belief, that he was the author of this tumult. And when we compare the ſingularly ferocious appearance of the mob, with the brutal violation of the apartment of the queen, there remains little doubt, but that a deſign was on foot againſt the lives of both her and the king.—Yet in this, and moſt other inſtances, the man has wanted courage to conſummate his villany, when the plot he had been following up was ripe.</p>
               <p>It is, perhaps, not the leaſt noble faculty of the mind, to queſtion the motives of action which are repugnant to the feelings of nature, outraging the moſt ſacred feelings of the human ſoul. But it is the developement of a character that enables us to eſtimate it's depravity; and had the conduct of that wretch ever varied, the veil of myſtery might ſtill have remained unrent, and poſterity, hearing of the judgment of the châtelet, would have believed <hi>Egalité</hi> innocent. The court had become highly obnoxious to the nation, and with it the king was implicated, in ſpite of the efforts of Mirabeau, and ſome other favourites of the people, to render him reſpectable; ſo that there wanted not a plauſible reaſon for ſuſpecting, that the duke might aſpire at obtaining the regency, though Louis was neither maſſacred, nor allowed to eſcape. But the preſent ſcheme being diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed, fear, for a while, damped his ambition: and La F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="329" facs="unknown:029916_0338_0FE30C5D8EE821B0"/>
the importunities of the duke, who wiſhed to viſit England, till the affair blew over. The king, therefore, was prevailed on to give him a nominal commiſſion, to be made uſe of as a plea to obtain liberty of abſence from the aſſembly, of which he was a member.</p>
               <p>He was certainly very apprehenſive of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation of the buſineſs; and revenge and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition equally giving way to perſonal fear, he left his colleagues to finiſh the conſtitution, and his agents to recover his fame, by repreſenting the ſtory as a calumny of the royaliſts, againſt whom the public were ſufficiently enraged to credit any aſperſion.</p>
               <p>The bold tone he aſſumed the July following was far from being a proof of his innocence; becauſe it was not very probable, that a cunning man ſhould take his meaſures in ſuch a critical affair without due precaution.—On the contrary, he would labour to ſink ſo entirely into the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ground of the plot, a to render it difficult if not impoſſible, for him to be perceived. And this was practicable to a man, who was willing, in the promotion of his purpoſe, to diſſipate the moſt ſplendid fortune.</p>
               <p>To a diſpoſition for low intrigue was added alſo a decided preference of the groſſeſt libertiniſm, ſeaſoned with vulgarity, highly congenial with the manners of the heroines, who compoſed the ſingular army of the females.</p>
               <p>Having taken up his abode in the centre of the Palais Royal, a very ſuperb ſquare, yet the laſt in which a perſon of any delicacy, not to mention decorum, or morality, would chooſe to reſide; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:029916_0339_0FE30CBEEECC02D0"/>
excepting the people in trade, who found it convenient, it was entirely occupied by the moſt ſhameleſs girls of the town, their hectoring pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors, gameſters and ſharpers of every denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. In ſhort, by the vileſt women; by wretches, who lived in houſes from which the ſtript bodies, often found in the Seine, were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be thrown<note n="*" place="bottom">They uſed to lie to be owned in a conſpicuous part of the city.</note>—and he was conſidered as the grand ſultan of this den of iniquity Living thus in the lap of crime, his heart was as tainted as the foul atmoſphere he breathed.—Incapable of affection, his amours were the jaundiced caprices of ſatiety; and having proved in the affair of Keppel and d'Orvilliers, that he wanted the courage of a man, he appears to have been as fit for dark under-hand aſſaſſinations as he was unequal to any attempt flowing from virtuous ambition.</p>
               <p>That a body of women ſhould put themſelves in motion to demand relief of the king, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate with the aſſembly reſpecting their tardy manner of forming the conſtitution, is ſcarcely probable; and that they ſhould have undertaken the buſineſs, without being inſtigated by deſigning perſons, when all Paris was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatisfied with the conduct and the procraſtination of the aſſembly, is a belief which the moſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous will hardly ſwallow, unleſs they take into their view, that the want of bread was the bye word uſed by thoſe, who in a great meaſure produced it; for perceiving the turn the public
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:029916_0340_0FE30CF9A28AD1B8"/>
mind was taking, they drove the mob on to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrate the miſchief long deſigned, under the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of national indignation.</p>
               <p>It is evident, that the court was not concerned, however deſirous the cabinet might have been to render the people diſcontented with the new order of things; for they ſeem to have been entirely occupied with the ſcheme, on which they built the moſt ſanguine expectation, of prevailing on the king to retire to Metz. Beſides, the courſe the project took is a circumſtantial evidence, that, deſigned againſt Verſailles, it was not meditated there.</p>
               <p>That the Châtelet ſhould not have been able to ſubſtantiate any proof of his guilt, is notin the leaſt extraordinary.—It is only neceſſary to be acquainted with the general propenſity of the French to intrigue, to know that there is no ſervice, however dangerous, or purpoſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever black, for which gold will not find a man. There were wretches, who would have conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed exile as an eſcape from the continual dread of menaced detection, could they carry with them a ſum to commence anew their fraudulent prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices in another country; and money the duke did not ſpare to gratify his paſſions, though fordidly mean when they were out of the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>His remaining alſo in England for ſuch a length of time, merely to avoid diſturbing the tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the ſtate, when it was poſſible, that by its diſorder and agitation he might gain a ſceptre, cannot be credited; becauſe it is well known, that he never ſacrificed any ſelfiſh conſideration to the general good. Such examples of ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:029916_0341_0FE30CC072A32A50"/>
and true patriotiſm are uncommon, even from the moſt virtuous men; and it is idle to imagine, that a man, whom all the world al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be vicious, ſhould riſk the popularity, which he had been at ſuch pains to acquire, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it were to guard his life.</p>
               <p>On his return, nevertheleſs, finding that all was ſafe, he appeared in the aſſembly provoking the inquiry from which he had before ſkulked; and braving detection, when the danger was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, he had the addreſs to perſuade the public of his innocence. Nay, the mock patriots of the day, pretending to deſpiſe princes, were glad to have a prince on their ſide.</p>
               <p>The report, that Mirabeau, always an avowed advocate for a limited monarchy, was concerned in the plot, was certainly a calumny; becauſe it is notorious, that he had an habitual contempt for the duke, which had even produced a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided coolneſs ſome time before. And, if any collateral proof of his innocence were neceſſary, it would be ſufficient to add, that the abbé Maury, his competitor in eloquence, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in opinion, declared there was no ground for his impeachment.</p>
               <p>It is unfortunate, indeed, that ſome of the villains employed were not immediately interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated. The ſoldier<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such an omiſſion it was to be feared, would produce
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:029916_0342_0FE30C72C5654190"/>
the moſt fatal conſequences, becauſe impunity never fails to ſtimulate the wretches, who have arrived at ſuch a pitch of wickedneſs, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit freſh, and, if poſſible, ſtill more atrocious crimes; and it is by ſuſpending the decrees of juſtice, that hardened miſcreants, made ſo by oppreſſion, give full ſcope to all the brutality of their ſanguinary diſpoſitions.</p>
               <p>This neglect, in their turn, was not the leaſt reprehenſible or fatal error, produced by the fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the aſſembly. The criſis demanded vigour and boldneſs.—The laws had been tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled on by a gang of banditti the moſt deſperate —The altar of humanity had been profaned— The dignity of freedom had been tarniſhed—The ſanctuary of repoſe, the aſylum of care and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, the chaſte temple of a woman, I conſider the queen only as one, the apartment where ſhe conſigns her ſenſes to the boſom of ſleep, folded in its arms forgetful of the world, was violated with murderous fury—The life of the king was aſſailed, when he had acceded to all their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands—And, when their plunder was ſnatched from them, they maſſacred the guards, who were doing their duty.—Yet theſe brutes were permitted triumphantly to eſcape—and dignified with the appellation of the people. Their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage was in a great meaſure attempted to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed by thoſe deputies, who ſometimes endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to gain an undue influence through the interpoſition of the mob.</p>
               <p>At this moment the aſſembly ought to have known, that the future reſpectability of their laws muſt greatly depend on the conduct they purſued on the preſent occaſion; and it was time

to ſhow the Pariſians, that, giving freedom to the nation, they meant to guard it by a ſtrict ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence to the laws, that naturally iſſue from the ſimple principles of equal juſtice they were adopting; puniſhing with juſt ſeverity all ſuch as ſhould offer to violate, or treat them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Wiſdom, preciſion, and courage, are the permanent ſupports of authority—the durable pillars of every juſt government, and they only require to be, as it were, the por<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>They ought to have ſtood up as one man in ſupport of inſulted juſtice; and by directing the arm of the law, have ſmothered in embryo that ſpirit of rebellion and licentiouſneſs, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to appear in the metropolis, it was to be feared would attain Herculean ſtrength by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, and ultimately overturn, with wanton thoughtleſſneſs, or headſtrong zeal, all their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. Yet ſo contrary was their conduct to the dictates of common ſenſe, and the common firmneſs of rectitude of intention, that they not only permitted that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The firmneſs of conduct, which the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of a people ſhould always maintain, had been wanting in the aſſembly from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment their power had been acknowledged; for
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:029916_0344_0FE30CFB30DDA4C0"/>
inſtead of being directed by any regular plan of proceeding, a line equally marked out by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and political prudence, they were hurried along by a giddy zeal, and by a burleſque affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of magnanimity; as puerile as the greater part of their debates were frivolous. Whilſt their vanity was gratified by the lively applauſes laviſhed on their inflated and popular declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they ſet fire to the foibles of the multitude, teaching their deſperate demagogues to become their rivals in this ſpecies of eloquence, till the plans of the leaders of clubs, and popular ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, were generally admired and purſued.</p>
               <p>The will of the people being ſupreme, it is not only the duty of their repreſentatives to reſpect it, but their political exiſtence ought to depend on their acting conformably to the will of their conſtituents. Their voice, in enlightened coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, is always the voice of reaſon. But in the infancy of ſociety and during the advancement of the ſcience of political liberty, it is highly neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for the governing authority to be guided by the progreſs of that ſcience; and to prevent, by judicious meaſures, any check being given to its advancement, whilſt equal care is taken not to produce the miſeries of anarchy by encouraging licentious freedom. The national aſſembly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, delighted with their blooming honours, ſuffered themſelves to be hurried forward by a multitude on whom political light had too ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly flaſhed, and ſeemed to have no apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the danger, which has ſo fatally reſulted from their tame acquieſcence.</p>
               <p>The people of Paris, who have more than their portion of the national vanity, believed that
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:029916_0345_0FE30D32C81FE138"/>
they had produced the revolution; and thinking themſelves both the father and mother of all the great events, which had happened ſince its commencement, and that the national aſſembly, whoſe conduct indeed betrayed ſymptoms of an underſtanding not adult, ought to be directed by their leading ſtrings, frequently declared, that liberty would not be ſecured, until the court and the aſſembly were brought within the walls of the capital. This was the ſubject of club de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, decided with legiſlative pompoſity, on the rumour of the intended evaſion of the king; and the inſult offered to the national cockade, the firſt of October, brought them to the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination—that it was proper he ſhould be there. —Such was their will, the capital of the nation —now ſovereign. Foreſeeing alſo, as they had already dreaded, that the only ſecurity for infant freedom would be to guard the court, and place in the centre of information their infant repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives; whom they alternately idolized and ſuſpected.</p>
               <p>The decorum of manners in a people, long ſubordinate to the authority of their magiſtrates, had on ſeveral occaſions, and even on the fifth of October, controlled the impetuous populace, who had undertaken, or joined in the enterprize; and conſidering the manner in which they were puſhed on, it is extraordinary, that they did not commit greater depredations. For with all their brutality, and eagerneſs to plunder the palace, they did not attempt to pillage Verſailles, though half famiſhed.</p>
               <p>The army of La Fayette indeed, principally compoſed of citizens, behaved not only in an
<pb n="337" facs="unknown:029916_0346_0FE30C866B9161A0"/>
irreproachable manner; but the celerity of their movements, their obedience to the diſcipline which they had ſo promptly acquired, joined to the clemency and moderation they diſplayed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the gratitude and reſpect of all parties.— Still, trembling for the rights that had been ſo gloriouſly ſnatched out of the clinched hand of deſpotiſm—it was the wiſh of all the leaders to have the king at Paris. It was in fact the general ſentiment at Paris, and of the greater part of the nation.</p>
               <p>That city, which had contributed ſo eſſentially in effecting the revolution, viewed with anxiety the influence of a party ſpirit in the aſſembly, though themſelves ſplit into ſeveral political ſects, who almoſt execrated each other. And finding that the indeciſion of the members had given freſh hopes to the court, which at laſt might render their emancipation merely a dazzling meteor, they were reſtleſsly bent on having the king and aſſembly more immediately in their power. The report, likewiſe, of Louis's intended eſcape; which had he effected, it was probable, that he would have been in the next place prevailed on to join the diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented princes and nobles, thus producing a ſchiſm in the kingdom that muſt infallibly have brought on not only a cruel civil war, but have embroiled them with all the different powers of Europe; was a ſtill more urgent motive: for whilſt they were conſtantly affecting to believe in the goodneſs of his heart, they never ſhowed by their conduct, that they had any confidence in his ſincerity.—Their opinion of the aſſembly was equally unfixed.—One day a deputy was
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:029916_0347_0FE30D3449FD9630"/>
extolled as the hero of liberty, and the next de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced as a traiterous penſioner of deſpotiſm.</p>
               <p>Theſe ſentiments were dangerous to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the new government; but they were ſentiments which never would have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulged, even had they exiſted, had the aſſembly acted with integrity and magnanimity. Becauſe, though the people do not always reaſon in the moſt logical or rhetorical ſtyle, yet they generally perceive in what conſiſts the defects of their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlators. And in every free government, when the deputies of the ſtate, convened to form laws, do not act with preciſion and judgment, they will be ſure to loſe their reſpectability; and the conſequence will be a diſſolution of all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
               <p>It appears to amount to a certainty, that the aſſembly did not at that time poſſeſs the implicit confidence of the people by their demanding, that the king ſhould be obliged to reſide within the barriers of the capital.—It was ſurely as poſſible to guard him at Verſailles as at Paris; and if it were neceſſary, that he ſhould be kept as a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner of ſtate, or hoſtage, the government was the proper authority to determine how, and where:—and in giving up this neceſſary privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of authority, they ſurrendered their power to the multitude of Paris.</p>
               <p>Or rather a minority of the aſſembly, who wiſhed to be removed to the capital, by exciting and humouring the people, directed the majority; and in the ſame manner has the dignity of the repreſentative body ever ſince been trampled under foot by ſelfiſhneſs, or the blind zeal of vanity.—It is in reality from this epocha, not
<pb n="339" facs="unknown:029916_0348_0FE30CFD60A18018"/>
forgetting ſuch a leading circumſtance, that the commencement of the reign of anarchy may be fairly dated. For, though a tolerable degree of order was preſerved a conſiderable time after, becauſe a multitude long accuſtomed to ſervitude do not immediately feel their own ſtrength; yet they ſoon began to tyrannize over one part of their repreſentatives, ſtimulated by the other. They, however, continued to reſpect the decrees of the national aſſembly eſpecially as there were rarely any paſſed on which the public opinion had not been previouſly conſulted, directed as it was by the popular members, who gained their conſtant ſuffrage by the ſtale trick of crying out for more freedom. It was the indiſpenſable duty of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to reſpect the dignity of their body.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of which for ſiniſter purpoſes, many of them inſtructed the people how to tyrannize over the aſſembly; thus deſerting the main principle of repreſentation, the reſpect due to the majority. This firſt grand deſertion of the principles, which they affected to adopt in all their purity, led to public miſery; involving theſe ſhort-ſighted men in the very ruin they had themſelves produced by their mean intrigues.</p>
               <p>The authoritative demand of the Pariſians was ſtriking ſo directly at the freedom of the aſſembly, that they muſt either have been conſcious of want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power, or they had no conception of dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of action, otherwiſe they would not have ſuffered the requiſition of the people to have been complied with. Yet they ſeem to have conſidered it, if it be not parado<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

childiſhly proud of regulating the buſineſs of the nation, though under the influence of the Pariſian deſpotiſm.</p>
               <p>It is true, ſuch things are the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of weakneſs, the effects of inexperience, and the more fatal errors of cowardice. And ſuch will always be the effects of timid, injudicious meaſures. Men who have violated the ſacred feelings of eternal juſtice, except they are harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in vice, are never afterwards able to look honeſt men in the face; and a legiſlature, watched by an intelligent public, a public that claims the right of thinking for itſelf, will never after go beyond it, or paſs one decree which is not likely to be popular.</p>
               <p>To conſult the public mind in a perfect ſtate of civilization, will not only be neceſſary, but it will be productive of the happieſt conſequences, generating a government emanating from the ſenſe of the nation, for which alone it can legally exiſt. The progreſs of reaſon being gradual, it is the wiſdom of the legiſlature to advance the ſimplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it's political ſyſtem, in a manner beſt adapted to the ſtate of improvement of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of the nation. The ſudden change which had happened in France, from the moſt ſettering tyranny to an unbridled liberty, made it ſcarcely to be expected, that any thing ſhould be managed with the wiſdom of experience: it was morally impoſſible. But it is nevertheleſs a deplorable reflection, that ſuch evils muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low every revolution, when a change of politics equally material is required.—Thus it becomes more peculiarly the duty of the hiſtorian to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord truth; and comment with freedom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="341" facs="unknown:029916_0350_0FE30D033AA2FC80"/>Every nation, deprived by the progreſs of it's civilization of ſtrength of character, in changing it's government from abſolute deſpotiſm to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened freedom, will, moſt probably, be plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into anarchy, and have to ſtruggle with various ſpecies of tyranny before it is able to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolidate it's liberty; and that, perhaps, cannot be done, until the manners and amuſements of the people are completely changed.</p>

The lively effuſions of mind, characteriſtically peculiar to the French, are as violent as the impreſſions are tranſitory: and their benevolence evaporating in ſudden guſts of ſympathy, they become cold in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as their emotions are quick, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations of their fancy brilliant.

               <argument>
                  <p>The mob demand the king's removal to Paris. This city deſcribed. The king repairs to the capital, eſcorted by a deputation of the national aſſembly and the Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian militia. The king's title changed. Proceedings of the national aſſembly. Reflections on the declaration of rights.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AFTER the wild tumult, on the morning of the 6th of October, abated, the king ſhowed himſelf to the people, in the balcony, and the queen followed with the dauphin in her arms. At firſt, he vainly attempted to ſpeak; but La Fayette informed the people, that his majeſty came forward to aſſure them, that it ſhould be the buſineſs of his life to contribute to the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his people. <hi>The king at Paris,</hi> exclaimed a voice, which was quickly re-echoed by the crowd. 'My children,' replied the king,
<q>you wiſh me to be at Paris, and I will go; but it is on the condition, that my wife and family accompany me.</q>
A loud ſhout of <hi>vive le r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>i</hi> teſtified the ecſtacy of the moment. The king made a ſign to demand ſilence; and then, with tears in his eyes addreſſed them again.—
<q>Ah! my children, run to the relief of my guards.</q>
Immediately two or three appeared in the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony with the national cockade in their hats, or the cap of liberty on their heads. The king threw his arms round one of them, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="343" facs="unknown:029916_0352_0FE30C7ED4ACD0F0"/>
following his example embraced thoſe whom they had taken priſoners in the court. One ſentiment of gladneſs ſeemed to animate the whole concourſe of people; and their ſenſibility pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced as mad demonſtrations of joy as lately had been diſplayed of ferocity. The ſoldiery all mingled together, exchanging ſwords, hats, or ſhoulder belts—exhibiting in the moſt ſtriking manner the prominent features of the French character.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile the aſſembly, inſtead of inſtantly examining into the particulars of that alarming convulſion, and exerting themſelves to cauſe a proper reſpect to be paid to the ſovereignty of the law, childiſhly gave way to the univerſal tranſport: inſtead of conſidering the peremptory wiſh of the people to remove the king to Paris as a diſtruſt of their wiſdom, as well as of the veracity of the court, which was in ſome meaſure the caſe, they unanimouſly agreed to the motion of Mirabeau, ſeconded by Barnave,
<q>that the king and aſſembly ſhould not be ſeparated du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the preſent ſeſſions.</q>
Mirabeau, and other popular members, were probably glad to have the perſon of the king ſecured, without being obliged to appear, in an oſtenſible manner, in the affair; becauſe they always endeavoured to keep a little hold on the court, whilſt they led the people. Such a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Readily then acquieſcing in a meaſure the moſt fatal and contemptible, they decreed, that the aſſembly was inſeparable from the perſon of the king, and ſent a deputation
<pb n="344" facs="unknown:029916_0353_0FE30D3F9B20E688"/>
to inform him of this reſolve, previous to his departure.</p>
               <p>That Louis, finding all his projects for the preſent defeated, and after ſuch a narrow eſcape for his life, ſhould readily have acceded to the demand of the multitude, is not in the leaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary.—But that the repreſentatives of the nation ſhould, without reſiſtance or remonſtrance, have ſurrendered their authority, and thrown themſelves head-long into the heart of a city, which could be ſuddenly agitated, and put into the moſt diſorderly and dangerous commotion, by the intrigues or folly of any deſperate or factious leader of the multitude—ſuffering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be environed by it's wall, ſhut in by it's barriers —in a word—chooſing to live in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious priſon; for men forced, or drawn into any ſuch ſituation, are in reality ſlaves or priſoners, —almoſt ſurpaſſes belief. This abſurd conduct, in fact, can be accounted for only by conſidering the national character, and the different though equally intereſted views, of the court and popular parties, in the aſſembly.</p>
               <p>Independent of the additional incenſe of praiſe, with which Mirabeau wiſhed to be continually regaled, in the metropolis, he had a decided pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for it, frequently aſſerting, that it was the only place where ſociety was truly deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; the people and place, in ſpite of their vices and follies, equally attaching the taſte they cultivated.</p>

The roads have an expanſion that agrees with the idea of a large luxurious city, and with the beauty of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the noble ſquare, that firſt attracts the traveller's eye. The lofty trees on each ſide of the road, forming charming alleys, in which the people walk and lounge with an eaſy gaiety pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the nation, ſeem calculated equally to ſecure their health and promote their pleaſure.

               <p>A deputation of the national aſſembly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied the royal family to Paris, as well as the Pariſian militia. A number of the women preceded them, mounted on the carriages which they had taken in their way to Verſailles, and on the cannons, covered with national cockades, and dragging in the dirt thoſe that were conſidered as ſymbols of ariſtocracy. Soon after they ſet out, either by chance, or, which is more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, purſuant to a plan contrived by ſome perſon in power, forty or fifty loads of wheat and flour fell into the proceſſion, juſt before the king, giving weight to the exclamation of the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, that they had brought the baker and his family to town.</p>

The abolition of <hi>lettres de cachet</hi> was conſidered, and a freſh organization of the municipalities propoſed; but as none of theſe motions were carried before they were more fully diſcuſſed at Paris, it ſeems beſt to bring the different arguments on thoſe important ſubjects under one point of view.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="348" facs="unknown:029916_0357_0FE30D411E8971A0"/>Settling the articles of the conſtitution, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which previouſly occupied them, ſeveral frivolous diſcuſſions, reſpecting the ſtyle of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion to be adopted to ſignify the king's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance of their decrees, were lengthened out with warmth, and puerile objections made to ancient forms—that were merely forms. After ſome diſputation, the title of the monarch was changed from king of France, with the reſt of the formule, for that of king of the French; becauſe Rouſſeau had remarked, perhaps faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidiouſly, that the title ought to expreſs rather the chief of the people, than the maſter of the ſoil.</p>
               <p>The intended removal of the aſſembly to Paris alſo produced ſeveral warm debates. This reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, indeed, excited, not without reaſon, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions in the breaſts of ſome of the deputies, relative to their perſonal ſafety, ſhould they, in future, venture to oppoſe any of the motions of the popular party, which that party inſtructed the mob of Paris to ſupport.</p>
               <p>The preſident, Mounier, pleading his bad ſtate of health, begged to be diſmiſſed; and Lally-Tolendal, thinking that he could not ſtem the torrent, retired from public buſineſs at the ſame time. A great many of the members hinting their fears, that the aſſembly would not be free at Paris, on varions pretexts demanded ſuch a number of paſſports, as to make the preſident expreſs ſome apprehenſion leſt the aſſembly ſhould thus indirectly diſſolve itſelf, whilſt other depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties uttered a profuſion of indecent ſarcaſms on a conduct, which the behaviour of the populace, and even of theſe very orators, ſeemed to juſtify.
<pb n="349" facs="unknown:029916_0358_0FE30D088933E178"/>
Mirabeau, who ſo earneſtly deſired to be at Paris, ridiculed with unbecoming bitterneſs every oppoſition made to the removal of the aſſembly; yet, liſtening to the repreſentation, that the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing ſo many malcontents to retire into the provinces might produce dangerous fermenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he propoſed that no paſſport ſhould be granted, till the deputy who demanded it had made known his reaſon for ſo doing to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. A letter from the king, notifying his intention of reſiding moſt part of his time at Paris, and expreſſing his aſſurance, that they did not mean to ſeparate themſelves from him, now requeſted them to ſend commiſſioners to Paris, to ſearch for a pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>After this determination ſeveral members gave an account of the groſs inſults they had received at Paris. One in particular, who was not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

How many times (he added) have I lamented the impetuoſity of this aſſembly, who have accuſtomed the public, ſeated in our galleries, to praiſe, to blame, to deride our opinions, without underſtanding

them.—And who has inſpired them with this audacity?</q>
—He was interrupted by ſigns of diſapprobation; and perſonalties now diſgraced the debate, in which Mirabeau mingled ſatiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal obſervations and retorts, that did more cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to his abilities than to his heart. But, a day or two after, recollecting himſelf, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the plan of a decree to prevent riots, which he introduced, by ſaying, that it was an imitation, though not a copy, of the Engliſh riot act.</p>
               <p>The evening before the departure of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly for Paris, paſſports being ſtill demanded with earneſtneſs, a decree was made,
<q>that paſſports ſhould be granted only for a ſhort and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate time, on account of urgent buſineſs; and that unlimited paſſports, in caſes of ill health, ſhould not be granted before the depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties were replaced by their ſubſtitutes;</q>
and further, cutting a knot that might have revived old claims and animoſities, had it been brought forward alone, they decreed,
<q>that in future the ſubſtitutes ſhould be nominated by the citizens at large; and that, eight days after the firſt ſeſſion at Paris, there ſhould be a call of the houſe; ſuſpending till then the conſideration of the propriety of printing and ſending to the provinces the liſt of the abſent deputies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The conſtraining ſo many members to remain at their poſts, and condemning a man to a ſtate of ignominious ſervitude, whilſt they were talking of nothing but liberty, was as contemptibly little, as the policy was injudicious. For if the king pretended to acquieſce in their meaſures the better to diſguiſe his real intention, which doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs

was to fly as ſoon as he could find an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, or was at liberty, what did they gain? For as they muſt have known, that his emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation would be the conſequence of his acceptance of the conſtitution, his impriſonment could only tend to retard their operations: yet they had neither the magnanimity to allow him to depart with an handſome ſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, as things were ſettled, it was morally certain, that, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his friends were ready, a blow would be directed againſt them, which they were then as well prepared to meet as they could be at a ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent period.</p>
               <p>Under the influence of fixed ſyſtems, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain moral effects are as infallible as phyſical.— That every inſiduous attempt would be made by the courts of Europe, to overturn the new go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of France, was therefore certain; and, unleſs they had all been overturned at the ſame time, was as much to be expected as any effect from a natural cauſe. The moſt likely mean then to have parried the evil would have been a decided firmneſs of conduct, which, flowing from a real love of juſtice, produces true magnanimity; and not a parading affectation of the virtues of Romans, with the degenerate minds of their poſterity.</p>
               <p>Preciſion, wiſdom, and courage, never fail to ſecure the admiration and reſpect of all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of people; and every government thus directed will keep in awe its licentious neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.

But fear and timidity betray ſymptoms of weakneſs, that, creating contempt and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, encourage the attempts of ambitious deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pots; ſo that the nobleſt cauſes are ſometimes ruined or vilified by the folly or indiſcretion of their directors. All Europe ſaw, and all good men ſaw with dread, that the French had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to ſupport a cauſe, which they had neither ſufficient purity of heart, nor maturity of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to conduct with moderation and prudence; whilſt malevolence has been gratified by the errors they have committed, attributing that imperfection to the theory they adopted, which was applicable only to the folly of their prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.</p>
               <p>However, Frenchmen have reaſon to rejoice, and poſterity will be grateful, for what was done by the aſſembly.</p>
               <p>The economy of government had been ſo ably treated by the writers of the preſent age, that it was impoſſible for them, acting on the great ſcale of public good, not to lay the foundations of many uſeful plans, as they reformed many grievous and grinding abuſes.—Accordingly we find, though they had not ſufficient penetration to foreſee the dreadful conſequences of years of anarchy, the probable reſult of their manner of proceeding, ſtill by following, in ſome degree, the inſtructions of their conſtituents, who had digeſted, from the bright lines of philoſophical truths, the prominent rules of political ſcience, they, in laying the main pillars of the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, eſtabliſhed beyond a poſſibility of oblitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the great principles of liberty and equality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="353" facs="unknown:029916_0362_0FE30D113612F0F8"/>It is allowed by all parties, that civilization is a bleſſing, ſo far as it gives ſecurity to perſon and property, and the milder graces of taſte to ſociety and manners. If, therefore, the poliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of man, and the improvement of his intellect, become neceſſary to ſecure theſe advantages, it follows, of courſe, that the more general ſuch improvement grows, the greater the extenſion of human happineſs.</p>
               <p>In a ſavage ſtate man is diſtinguiſhed only by ſuperiority of genius, proweſs, and eloquence. I ſay eloquence, for I believe, that in this ſtage of ſociety he is moſt eloquent becauſe moſt natural. For it is only in the progreſs of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, that hereditary diſtinctions, cruelly abridging rational liberty, have prevented man from riſing to his juſt point of elevation, by the exerciſe of his improvable faculties.</p>
               <p>That there is a ſuperiority of natural genius among men does not admit of diſpute; and that in countries the moſt free there will always be diſtinctions proceeding from ſuperiority of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the power of acquiring more delicacy of taſte, which may be the effect of the peculiar organization, or whatever cauſe produces it, is an inconteſtible truth. But it is a palpable error to ſuppoſe, that men of every claſs are not equally ſuſceptible of common improvement: if therefore it be the contrivance of any government, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from a chance of improvement the greater part of the citizens of the ſtate, it can be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in no other light tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The melioration of the old government of France aroſe entirely from a degree of urbanity acquired by the higher claſs, which inſenſibly produced, by a kind of natural courteſy, a ſmall portion of civil liberty. But, as for political liberty, there was not the ſhadow of it; or could it ever have been generated under ſuch a ſyſtem: becauſe, whilſt men were prevented not only from arriving at public offices, or voting for the nomination of others to fill them, but even from attaining any diſtinct idea of what was meant by liberty in a practical ſenſe, the great bulk of the people were worſe than ſavages; retaining much of the ignorance of barbarians, after having poiſoned the noble qualities of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by imbibing ſome of the habits of degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate refinement. To the national aſſembly it is, that France is indebted for having prepared a ſimple code of inſtruction, containing all the truths neceſſary to give a comprehenſive percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of political ſcience; which will enable the ignorant to climb the mount of knowledge, whence they may view the ruins of the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious fabric of deſpotiſm, that had ſo long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced the dignity of man by its odious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſing claims.</p>
               <p>The declaration of rights contains an aggregate of principles the moſt beneficial; yet ſo ſimple, that the moſt ordinary capacity cannot fail to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend their import. It begins by aſſerting, that the rights of man are equal, and that no mental
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:029916_0364_0FE30D12B9979B48"/>
diſtinctions can exiſt in a wholeſome government, but what are founded on public utility. Then ſhowing, that political aſſociations are intended only for the preſervation of the natural and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſcriptible rights of man, which are his liberty, ſecurity of property, and reſiſtance againſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and aſſerting alſo, that the nation is the ſource of all ſovereignty; it delineates, in a plain and perſpicuous manner, in what theſe rights, and this ſovereignty, conſiſt. In this delineation men may learn, that, in the exerciſe of their natural rights, they have the power of doing whatever does not injure another; and that this power has no limits, which are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by law—the laws being at the ſame time an expreſſion of the will of the community, becauſe all the citizens of the ſtate, either per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally or by their repreſentatives, have a right to concur in the formation.</p>
               <p>Thus, having taught the citizens the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental principles of a legitimate government, it proceeds to ſhow how the opinion of each may be aſcertained; which he has a right to give perſonally or by his repreſentatives, to determine the neceſſity of public contributions, their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation, mode of aſſeſſment, and duration.</p>
               <p>The ſimplicity of theſe principles, prom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

beneficial truths—truths, the exiſtence of which had been eternal; and which required only to be made known, to be generally acknowledged —truths, which have been foſtered by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of philoſophy, whilſt hereditary wealth and the bayonet of deſpotiſm have continually been oppoſed to their eſtabliſhment.</p>
               <p>The publicity of a government acting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formably to the principles of reaſon, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction to the maxims of oppreſſion, affords the people a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Such conſultations can take place under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative ſyſtems of government only—under ſyſtems which demand the reſponſibility of their miniſters, and ſecure the publicity of their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical conduct. The myſteries of courts, and the intrigues of their pariſites, have continually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luged Europe with the blood of its moſt worthy and heroic citizens, and there is no ſpecific cure for ſuch evils but by enabling the people to form an opinion reſpecting the ſubject of diſpute.</p>

               <p>PEOPLE thinking for themſelves have more energy in their voice, than any govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which it is poſſible for human wiſdom to invent; and every government not aware of this ſacred truth will, at ſome period, be ſuddenly overturned. Whilſt men in a ſavage ſtate preſerve their independence. they adopt no regular ſyſtem of policy, nor ever attempt to digeſt their rude code of laws into a conſtitution, to enſure poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical liberty. Conſequently we find in every country after its civilization has arrived at a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain height, that the people, the moment they are diſpleaſed with their rulers, begin to clamour againſt them; and, finally rejecting all authority but their own will, in breaking the ſhackles of folly or tyranny, they glut their reſentment by the miſchievous deſtruction of the works of ages, only conſidering them as the monuments of their ſervitude.</p>
               <p>From the ſocial diſpoſition of man, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as he becomes civilized, he will mingle more and more with ſociety. The firſt intereſt

Thus he is enabled to eſtimate the portion of evil or good which the government of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try produces, compared with that of others; and the compariſon, granting him ſuperior pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of mind, leads hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This ſpirit of inquiry firſt manifeſts itſelf in hamlets; when his views of improvement are confined to local advantages: but the approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of different diſtricts leading to further intercourſe, roads of communication are opened, until a central or favourite ſpot becomes the vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tex of men and things. Then the riſing ſpires, pompous domes, and majeſtic monuments, point out the capital; the focus of information, the reſervoir of genius, the ſchool of arts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the ſeat of voluptuous gratification, and the hot-bed of vice and immorality.</p>
               <p>The centrifugal rays of knowledge and ſcience now ſtealing through the empire, the whole intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual faculties of man partake of their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and one general ſentiment governs the civil and political body. In the progreſs of theſe improvements the ſtate undergoing a variety of changes, the happineſs or miſery produced occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions a diverſity of opinions; and to prevent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, abſolute governments have been tolerated by the moſt enlightened part of the people. But,
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:029916_0369_0FE30D5FCDDC2050"/>
probably, this toleration was merely the effect of the ſtrong ſocial feelings of men; who prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red tranquility, and the proſperity of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to a reſiſtance, which, judging from the ignorance of their fellow citizens, they believed would bring more harm than good in it's train. In ſhort, however long a combination of tyranny has retarded the progreſs, it has been one of the advantages of the large cities of Europe, to light up the ſparks of reaſon, and to extend the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of truth.</p>
               <p>Such is the good and evil flowing from the capitals of ſtates, that during the infancy of governments, though they tend to corrupt and enervate the mind, they accelerate the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſcience, and give the tone to the national ſentiments and taſte.</p>
               <p>But this influence is extremely gradual; and it requires a great length of time, for the remote corners of the empire to experience either the one, or the other of theſe effects. Hence we have ſeen the inhabitants of a metropolis feeble and vitiated, and thoſe of the provinces robuſt and virtuous. Hence we have ſeen oppoſitions in a city (riots as they are called) to illegal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inſtantly defeated, and their leaders hanged or tortured; becauſe the judgment of the ſtate was not ſufficiently matured to ſupport the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of the unhappy victims in a righteous cauſe. And hence it has happened, that the deſpots of the world have found it neceſſary to maintain large ſtanding armies, in order to counteract the effects of truth and reaſon.</p>
               <p>The continuation of the feudal ſyſtem, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for a great length of time, by giving an
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:029916_0370_0FE30D1BD38DC878"/>
overgrown influence to the nobility of France, had contributed, in no ſmall degree, to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the deſpotiſm of her kings. Thus it was not until after the arbitrary adminiſtration of Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu, who had terrified the whole order by a tyranny peculiar to himſelf, that the inſidious Mazarine broke the independent ſpirit of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by introducing the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Beſides, the encouragement given to enervating pleaſures, and the venality of titles, purchaſed either with money, or ignoble ſervices, ſoon rendered the nobility as notorious for effeminacy as they had been illuſtrious for heroiſm in the days of the gallant Henry.</p>
               <p>The arts had already formed a ſchool, and men of ſcience and literature were hurrying from every part of the kingdom to the metropolis, in ſearch of employment and of honour; and whilſt it was giving it's tone to the empire, the Pariſian taſte was pervading Europe.</p>
               <p>The vanity of leading the faſhions, in the higher orders of ſociety, is not the ſmalleſt weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs produced by the ſluggiſhneſs into which people of quality naturally fall. The depravity of manners, and the ſameneſs of pleaſure, which compoſe a life of idleneſs, are ſure to produce an inſupportable <hi>ennui;</hi> and, in proportion to the ſtupidity of the man, or as his ſenſibility be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes

deadened, he has recourſe to variety, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a zeſt only from a new creation of charms; and commonly the moſt unnatural are neceſſary to rouſe ſickly, faſtidious ſenſes. Still in the ſame degree as the refinement of ſentiment, and the improvement of taſte advance, the company of celebrated literary characters is ſought after with avidity; and from the prevalence of faſhion, the empire of wit ſucceeds the reign of formal inſipidity, after the ſqueamiſh palate has been rendered delicate even by the nauſeous banquets of voluptuouſneſs.</p>
               <p>This is the natural conſequence of the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of manners, the harbinger of reaſon; and from the ratio of it's advancement throughout ſociety, we are enabled to eſtimate the progreſs of political ſcience. For no ſooner had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of philoſophical ſubjects become general in the ſelect parties of amuſement, extending by degrees to every claſs of ſociety, than the rigour of the ancient government of France began to ſoften; till it's mildneſs became ſo conſiderable, that ſuperficial obſervers have attributed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of lenity in the adminiſtration to the wiſdom and excellence of the ſyſtem itſelf.</p>
               <p>A confederacy of philoſophers, whoſe opinions furniſhed the food of colloquial entertainment, gave a turn for inſtructive and uſeful reading to the leaders of circles, and drew the attention of the nation to the principles of political and civil government. Whilſt by the compilation of the Encyclopedia, the repoſitory of their thoughts, as an abſtract work, they eluded the dangerous vigilance of abſolute miniſters; thus in a body diſſeminating thoſe truths in the economy of
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:029916_0372_0FE30C6FBB2FBFA8"/>
finance, which, perhaps they would not have had ſufficient courage ſeparately to have produced in individual publications; or, if they had, they would moſt probably have been ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p>This is one of the few inſtances of an aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men becoming uſeful, inſtead of being cramped by joint exertions. And the cauſe is clear:—the work did not require a little party ſpirit; but each had a diſtinct ſubject of inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to purſue with ſolitary energy. His deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was traced upon a calm ſea, which could not expoſe him to the Scylla or Charybdis of vanity or intereſt.</p>
               <p>The economiſts, carrying away the palm from their opponents, ſhowed that the proſperity of a ſtate depends on the freedom of induſtry; that talents ſhould be permitted to find their level; that the unſhackling of commerce is the only ſecret to render it flouriſhing, and anſwer more effectually the ends for which it is politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally neceſſary; and that the impoſts ſhould be laid upon the ſurplus remaining, after the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman has been reimburſed for his labour and expences.</p>
               <p>Ideas ſo new, and yet ſo juſt and ſimple, could not fail to produce a great effect on the minds of Frenchmen; who, conſtitutionally attached to novelty and ingenious ſpeculations, were ſure to be enamoured with a proſpect of conſolidating the great advantages of ſuch a novel and enlightened ſyſtem; and without calculating the danger of attacking old prejudices; nay, without ever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering, that it was a much eaſier taſk to pull down than to build up, they gave themſelves little trouble to examine the gradual ſteps by which
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:029916_0373_0FE30D688F84C358"/>
other countries have attained their degree of political improvement.</p>
               <p>The many vexatious taxes, which under the French government not only enervated the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of unprivileged perſons, ſtagnating the live ſtream of trade, but were extremely teaſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences to every private man, who could not travel from one place to another without being ſtopped at barriers, and ſearched by offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of different deſcriptions, were almoſt inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable impediments in the way of the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of induſtry. and the abridgment of liberty was not more grievous in its pecuniary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, than in the perſonal mortification of being compelled to obſerve regulations as trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome as they were at variance with ſound policy.</p>
               <p>Irritations of the temper produce more poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſenſations of diſguſt than ſerious injuries. Frenchmen, indeed, had been ſo long accuſtomed to theſe vexatious forms, that, like the ox who is daily yoked, they were no longer galled in ſpirit, or exhaled their angry ebullitions in a ſong. Still it might have been ſuppoſed, that after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting little, and talking much, about the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and ſuperior excellence of the plans of <hi>French</hi> writers above thoſe of other nations, they would become as paſſionate for liberty, as a man reſtrained by ſome idle religious vow is to poſſeſs a miſtreſs, to whoſe charms the imagination has lent all its own world of graces.</p>
               <p>Beſides, the very manner of living in France gives a lively turn to the character of the people; for by the deſtruction of the animal juices, in dreſſing their food, they are ſubject to none of
<pb n="365" facs="unknown:029916_0374_0FE30D1D55345C28"/>
that dulneſs, the effect of more nutritive diet in other countries; and this gaiety is increaſed by the moderate quantity of weak wine, which they drink at their meals, bidding deſiance to phlegm. The people alſo living entirely in villages and towns are more ſocial; ſo that the tone of the capital, the inſtant it had a note diſtinct from that of the court, became the key of the nation; though the inhabitants of the provinces poliſhed their manners with leſs danger to their morals, or natural ſimplicity of character. But this mode of peopling the country tended more to civilize the inhabitants, than to change the face of the ſoil, or lead to agricultural improvements. For it is by reſiding in the midſt of their land, that farmers make the moſt of it, in every ſenſe of the word— ſo that the rude ſtate of huſbandry, and the awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs of the implements uſed by theſe inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious people, may be imputed ſolely to this cauſe.</p>
               <p>The ſituation of France was likewiſe very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable for collecting the information acquired in other parts of the world. Paris, having been made a thoroughfare to all the kingdoms on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, received in its boſom ſtrangers from every quarter; and itſelf reſembling a full hive, the very drones buzzed into every corner all the ſentiments of liberty, which it is poſſible for a people to poſſeſs, who have never been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by the broad ſunſhine of freedom; yet more romantically enthuſiaſtic, probably for that very reaſon. Paris, therefore, having not only diſſeminated information, but preſented herſelf as a bulwark to oppoſe the deſpotiſm of the court, ſtanding the brunt of the fray, ſeems with ſome
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:029916_0375_0FE30C7BCE1437B0"/>
reaſon, to pride herſelf on being the author of the revolution.</p>
               <p>Though the liberty of the preſs had not exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any part of the world, England and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica excepted, ſtill the diſquiſition of political queſtions had long occupied the intelligent parts of Europe; and in France, more than in any country, books written with licentious freedom were handed from houſe to houſe with the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpection that irritates curioſity. Not to lay great ſtreſs on the univerſality of the language, which made one general opinion on the benefits ariſing from the advancement of ſcience and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon pervade the neighbouring ſtates, particularly Germany; where original compoſitions began to take place of that laborious erudition, which being employed only in the elucidation of ancient writers, the judgment lies dormant, or is merely called into action to weigh the import of words rather than to eſtimate the value of things. In Paris, likewiſe, a knot of ingenious if not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found writers, twinkled their light into every circle; for being careſſed by the great, they did not inhabit the homely receſſes of indigence, ruſticating their manners as they cultivated their underſtandings; on the contrary, the fineſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to convey their free ſentiments in their books, broken into the ſmall ſhot of innuendoes, gave an oilineſs to their converſation, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled them to take the lead at tables, the volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs of which was grateful to philoſophers, rather of the epicurean than the ſtoic ſect.</p>
               <p>It had long been the faſhion to talk of liberty, and to diſpute on hypothetical and logical points
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:029916_0376_0FE30D1F695ED5E8"/>
of political economy; and theſe diſputations diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminated gleams of truth, and generated more demagogues than had ever appeared in any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern city.—The number exceeded, perhaps, any compariſon with that of Athens itſelf.</p>
               <p>The habit alſo of paſſing a part of moſt of their evenings at ſome theatre, gave them an ear for harmony of language, and a faſtidious taſte for ſheer declamation, in which a ſentimental jargon extinguiſhes all the ſimplicity and fire of paſſion; the great number of play-houſes<note n="*" place="bottom">There are upwards of thirty ſcattered throughout the city.</note>, and the moderate prices of the pit and different ranges of boxes, bringing it within the compaſs of every citizen to frequent the amuſement ſo much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved by the French.</p>
               <p>The arrangement of ſounds, and the adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of maſculine and feminine rhymes, being the ſecrets of their poetry, the pomp of diction gives a ſemblance of grandeur to common obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations and hackneyed ſentiments; becauſe the French language, though copious in the phraſes that give each ſhade of ſentiment, has not, like the Italian, the Engliſh, the German, a phraſeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy peculiar to poetry; yet its happy turns, equivocal, nay even conciſe expreſſions, and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous epithets, which, when ingeniouſly appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, convey a ſentence, or afford matter for half a dozen, make it better adapted to oratorical flouriſhes than that of any other nation. The French therefore are all rhetoricians, and they have a ſingular fund of ſuperficial knowledge, caught in the tumult of pleaſure from the ſhallow
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:029916_0377_0FE30D6A114B8168"/>
ſtream of converſation; ſo that if they have not the depth of thought which is obtained only by contemplation, they have all the ſhrewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſharpened wit; and their acquirements are ſo near their tongue's end, that they never miſs an opportunity of ſaying a pertinent thing, or tripping up, by a ſmart retort, the arguments with which they have not ſtrength fairly to wreſtle.</p>
               <p>Every political good carried to the extreme muſt be productive of evil; yet every poiſon has its antidote; and there is a pitch of luxury and refinement, which, when reached, will overturn all the abſolute governments in the world. The aſcertainment of theſe antidotes is a taſk the moſt difficult; and whilſt it remains imperfect, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of men will continue to be the victims of miſtaken applications. Like the empirics, who bled a patient to death to prevent a mortification from becoming fatal, the tyrants of the earth have had recourſe to cutting off the heads, or torturing the bodies, of thoſe perſons who have attempted to check their ſway, or doubt their omnipotence. But, though thouſands have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed the victims of empirics, and of deſpots, yet the improvements made both in medicine and moral philoſophy have kept a ſure, though gradual pace.—And, if men have not clearly diſcovered a ſpecific remedy for every evil, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical, moral, and political, it is to be preſumed, that the accumulation of experimental facts will greatly tend to leſſen them in future.</p>
               <p>Whilſt, therefore, the ſumptuous galas of the court of France were the grand ſource of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of the arts, taſte became the antidote
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:029916_0378_0FE30D248E5B6658"/>
to <hi>ennui;</hi> and when ſentiment had taken place of chivalrous and gothic tournaments, the reign of philoſophy ſucceeded that of the imagination. And though the government, enveloped in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents, adjuſted ſtill the idle ceremonials, which were no longer impoſing, blind to the impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible change of things and opinions, as if their faculties were bound by an eternal froſt, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs was invariable; till, reaching a certain point, Paris, which from the particular formation of the empire had been ſuch an uſeful head to it, began to be the cauſe of dreadful calamities, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending from individuals to the nation, and from the nation to Europe. Thus it is, that we are led to blame thoſe, who, inſiſt, that, becauſe a ſtate of things has been productive of good, it is always reſpectable; when, on the contrary, the endeavouring to keep alive any hoary eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, beyond its natural date, is often per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious and always uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>In the infancy of governments, or rather of civilization, courts ſeem to be neceſſary to accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the improvement of arts and manners, to lead to that of ſcience and morals. Large capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are the obvious conſequences of the riches and luxury of courts; but as, after they have arrived at a certain magnitude and degree of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, they become dangerous to the freedom of the people, and incompatible with the ſafety of a republican government, it may be queſtioned whether Paris will not occaſion more diſturbance in ſettling the new order of things, than is equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to the good ſhe produced by accelerating the epocha of the revolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="370" facs="unknown:029916_0379_0FE30D6BAD922340"/>However, it appears very certain, that ſhould a republican government be conſolidated, Paris muſt rapidly crumble into decay. Its riſe and ſplendor were owing chiefly, if not entirely, to the old ſyſtem of government; and ſince the foundation of its luxury has been ſhaken, and it is not likely that the diſparting ſtructure will ever again reſt ſecurely on its baſis, we may fairly infer, that in proportion as the charms of ſolitary reflection and agricultural recreations are felt, the people, by leaving the villages and cities, will give a new complexion to the face of the country—and we may then look for a turn of mind more ſolid, principles more fixed, and a conduct more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent and virtuous.</p>
               <p>The occupations and habits of life have a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful influence on the forming mind; ſo great, that, the ſuperinductions of art ſtop the growth of the ſpontaneous ſhoots of nature, till it is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to diſtinguiſh natural from factitious morals and feelings; and as the energy of thinking will always proceed, in a great meaſure, either from our education or manner of living, the frivolty of the French character may be accounted for, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out taking refuge in the old hiding place of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance—occult cauſes.</p>
               <p>When it is the object of education, to prepare the pupil to pleaſe every body, and of courſe to deceive, accompliſhments are the one thing need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; and the deſire to be admired ever being uppermoſt, the paſſions are ſubjugated, or all drawn into the whirlpool of egotiſm <note n="*" place="bottom">I uſe this word according to the French acceptation, becauſe we have not one to expreſs ſo forcibly the ſame ſignification.</note>. This
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:029916_0380_0FE30D26CDFB50B0"/>
gives to each perſon, however different the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, a tincture of vanity, and that weak vacilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of opinion, which is incompatible with wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> we term character.</p>
               <p>Thus a Frenchman, like moſt women, may be ſaid to have no character diſtinguiſhable from that of the nation; unleſs little ſhades, and caſual lights, be allowed to conſtitute an eſſential characteriſtic. What then could have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, when their ambition was moſtly confined to dancing gracefully, entering a room with eaſy aſſurance, and ſmiling on and complimenting the very perſons whom they meant to ridicule at the next faſhionable aſſembly? The learning to fence with ſkill it is true, was uſeful to a people, whoſe falſe notions of honour required that at leaſt a drop of blood ſhould atone for the ſhadow of an affront. The knack alſo of uttering ſprightly repartees became a neceſſary art, to ſupply the place of that real intereſt only to be nouriſhed in the affectionate intercourſe of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic intimacy, where confidence enlarges the heart it opens. Beſides, the deſire of eating of every diſh at table, no matter if there were fifty, and the cuſtom of ſeparating immediately after the repaſt, deſtroy the ſocial affections, remind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſtranger of the vulgar ſaying—'every man for himſelf, and God for us all.' After theſe curſory obſervations, it is not going too far to advance, that the French were in ſome reſpects the moſt unqualified of any people in Europe to undertake the important work in which they are embarked.</p>
               <p>Whilſt pleaſure was the ſole object of living among the higher orders of ſociety, it was the
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:029916_0381_0FE30D6E1D99F8F0"/>
buſineſs of the lower to give life to their joys, and convenience to their luxury. This caſt-like diviſion, by deſtroying all ſtrength of character in the former, and debaſing the latter to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines, taught Frenchmen to be more ingenious in their contrivances for pleaſure and ſhow, than the men of any other country; whilſt, with reſpect to the abridgment of labour in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic arts, or to promote the comfort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon life, they were far behind. They had never, in fact, acquired an idea of that independent, comfortable ſituation, in which contentment is ſought rather than happineſs; becauſe the ſlaves of pleaſure or power can be rouſed only by lively emotions and extravagant hopes. Indeed they have no word in their vocabulary to expreſs <hi>comfort</hi>—that ſtate of exiſtence, in which reaſon renders ſerene and uſeful the days, which paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion would only cheat with flying dreams of happineſs.</p>
               <p>A change of character cannot be ſo ſudden as ſome ſanguine calculators expect: yet by the deſtruction of the rights of primogeniture, a greater degree of equality of property is ſure to follow; and as Paris cannot maintain its ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, but by the trade of luxury, which can never be carried to the ſame height it was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, the opulent having ſtrong motives to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them to live more in the country, they muſt acquire new inclinations and opinions.—As a change alſo of the ſyſtem of education and domeſtic manners will be a natural conſequence of the revolution, the French will inſenſibly riſe to a dignity of character far above that of the preſent race; and then the fruit of their liberty,

ripening gradually, will have a reliſh not to be expected during its crude and forced ſtate.</p>
               <p>The late arrangement of things ſeems to have been the common effect of an abſolute govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, a domineering prieſthood, and a great inequality of fortune; and whilſt it completely deſtroyed the moſt important end of ſociety, the comfort and independence of the people, it ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated the moſt ſhameful depravity and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of intellect; ſo that we have ſeen the French engaged in a buſineſs the moſt ſacred to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, giving by their enthuſiaſm, ſplendid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of their fortitude at one moment, and at another, by their want of firmneſs and deficiency of judgment, affording the moſt glaring and fatal proofs of the juſt eſtimate, which all nations have formed of their character.</p>
               <p>Men ſo thoroughly ſophiſticated, it was to be ſuppoſed would never conduct any buſineſs with ſteadineſs and moderation: but it required a knowledge of the nation and their manners, to form a diſtinct idea of their diſguſting conceit and wretched egotiſm; ſo far ſurpaſſing all the calculations of reaſon, that perhaps, ſhould not a faithful picture be now ſketched, poſterity would be at a loſs to account for their folly; and attribute to madneſs, what aroſe from imbecility.</p>
               <p>The natural feelings of man ſeldom become ſo contaminated and debaſed as not ſometimes to let eſcape a gleam of the generous fire, an ethereal ſpark of the ſoul; and it is theſe glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing emotions, in the inmoſt receſſes of the heart, which have continued to feed feelings, that on ſudden occaſions manifeſt themſelves with all their priſtine purity and vigour. But, by the
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:029916_0383_0FE30D7464AEBB58"/>
habitual ſlothfulneſs of ruſty intellects, or the depravity of the heart, lulled into hardneſs on the laſcivious couch of pleaſure, thoſe heavenly beams are obſcured, and man appears either an hideous monſter, a devouring beaſt; or a ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs reptile, without dignity or humanity.</p>
               <p>Thoſe miſerable wretches who crawl under the feet of others are ſeldom to be found among ſavages, where men accuſtomed to exerciſe and temperance are, in general, brave, hoſpitable, and magnanimous; and it is only as they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render their rights, that they loſe thoſe noble qualities of the heart. The ferocity of the ſavage is of a diſtinct nature from that of the degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſlaves of the tyrants. O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The moſt melancholy reflections are produced by a retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective glance over the riſe and progreſs of the governments of different countries, when we are compelled to remark, that flagrant follies and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>trocious crimes have been more common under the governments of modern Europe, than in any of the ancient nations, if we except the Jews. Sanguinary tortures, inſidious poiſonings, and
<pb n="375" facs="unknown:029916_0384_0FE30D29D3B13AB0"/>
dark aſſaſſinations, have alternately exhibited a race of monſters in human ſhape, the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of whoſe ferocity chills the blood, and darkens every enlivening expectation of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: but we ought to obſerve, to reanimate the hopes of benevolence, that the perpetration of theſe horrid deeds has ariſen from a deſpotiſm in the government, which reaſon is teaching us to remedy. Sometimes, it is true, reſtrained by an iron police, the people appear peaceable, when they are only ſtunned; ſo that we find, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the mob has broken looſe, the fury of the populace has been ſhocking and calamitous. Theſe conſiderations account for the contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the French character, which muſt ſtrike a ſtranger: for robberies are very rare in France, where, daily frauds and ſly pilfering prove, that the lower claſs have as little honeſty as ſincerity. Beſides, murder and cruelty almoſt always ſhow the daſtardly ferocity of fear in France; whilſt in England, where the ſpirit of liberty has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, it is uſual for an highwayman, demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your money, not only to avoid barbarity, but to behave with humanity, and even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance.</p>
               <p>Degeneracy of morals, with poliſhed manners, produces the worſt of paſſions, which floating through the ſocial body, the genial current of natural feelings has been poiſoned; and, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting crimes with trembling inquietude, the culprits have not only drawn on themſelves the vengeance of the law, but thrown an odium on their nature, that has blackened the face of humanity. And whilſt its temple has been ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilegiouſly, profaned by the drops of bloo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which have iſſued from the very hearts of the ſad victims of their folly; a hardneſs of temper, under the veil of ſentiment, calling it vice, has prevented our ſympathy from leading us to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine into the ſources of the atrocity of our ſpecies, and obſcured the true cauſe of diſgraceful and vicious habits.</p>
               <p>Since the exiſtence of courts, whoſe aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſement has been conſpicuous in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree as the miſeries of the debaſed people have accumulated, the convenience and comfort of men have been ſacrificed to the oſtentatious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of pomp and ridiculous pageantry. For every order of men, from the beggar to the king, has tended to introduce that extravagance into ſociety, which equally blaſts domeſtic virtue and happineſs. The prevailing cuſtom of living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their income has had the moſt baneful effect on the independence of individuals of every claſs in England, as well as in France; ſo that whilſt they have lived in habits of idleneſs, they have been drawn into exceſſes, which, proving ruinous, produced conſequences equally perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the community, and degrading to the private character. Extravagance forces the peer to proſtitute his talents and influence for a place, to repair his broken fortune; and the country gentleman becomes venal in the ſenate, to enable himſelf to live on a par with him, or reimburſe himſelf for the expences of electioneering, into which he was led by ſheer vanity. The profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, on the ſame account, become equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled. The one, whoſe characteriſtic ought to be integrity, deſcends to chicanery; whilſt another triſles with the health, of which it
<pb n="377" facs="unknown:029916_0386_0FE30D312763ADE0"/>
knows all the importance. The merchant like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe enters into ſpeculations ſo cloſely bordering on fraudulency, that common ſtraight forward minds can ſcarcely diſtinguiſh the devious art of ſelling any thing for a price far beyond that neceſſary to enſure a juſt profit, from ſheerdiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty, aggravated by hard-heartedneſs, when it is to take advantage of the neceſſities of the indigent.</p>
               <p>The deſtructive influence of commerce, it is true, carried on by men who are eager by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown riches to partake of the reſpect paid to nobility, is felt in a variety of ways. The moſt pernicious, perhaps, is it's producing an ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy of wealth, which degrades mankind, by making them only exchange ſavageneſs for tame ſervility, inſtead of acquiring the urbanity of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved reaſon. Commerce alſo, overſtocking a country with people, obliges the majority to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come manufacturers rather than huſbandmen; and then the diviſion of labour, ſolely to enrich the proprietor, renders the mind entirely inactive. The time which, a celebrated writer ſays, is ſauntered away, in going from one part of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment to another, is the very time that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the man from degenerating into a brute; for every one muſt have obſerved how much more intelligent are the blackſmiths, carpenters, and maſons in the country, than the journeymen in great towns; and, reſpecting morals there is no making a compariſon. The very gait of the man, who is his own maſter, is ſo much more ſteady than the ſlouching ſtep of the ſervant of a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, that it is unneceſſary to aſk which proves
<pb n="378" facs="unknown:029916_0387_0FE30C6221FE29E8"/>
by his actions he has the moſt independence of character.</p>
               <p>The acquiring of a fortune is likewiſe the leaſt arduous road to pre-eminence, and the moſt ſure: thus are whole knots of men turned into machines, to enable a keen ſpeculator to become wealthy; and every noble principle of nature is eradicated by making a man paſs his life in ſtretching wire, pointing a pin, heading a nail, or ſpreading a ſheet of paper on a plain ſurface. Beſides, it is allowed, that all aſſociations of men render them ſenſual, and conſequently ſelfiſh; and whilſt lazy friars are driven out of their cells as ſtagnate bodies that corrupt ſociety, it may admit of a doubt whether large work-ſhops do not contain men equally tending to impede that gradual progreſs of improvement, which lead<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of reaſon, and the eſtabliſhment of rational equality.</p>
               <p>The deprivation of natural, equal, civil and political rights, reduced the moſt cunning of the lower orders to practiſe fraud, and the reſt to habits of ſtealing, audacious robberies, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. And why? becauſe the rich and poor were ſeparated into bands of tyrants and ſlaves, and the retaliation of ſlaves is always terrible. In ſhort, every ſacred feeling, moral and divine, has been obliterated, and the dignity of man ſallied, by a ſyſtem of policy and juriſprudence as repugnant to reaſon as at variance with hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity.</p>
               <p>The only excuſe that can be made for the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the Pariſians is then ſimply to obſerve, that they had not any confidence in the laws,
<pb n="379" facs="unknown:029916_0388_0FE30C509BD04128"/>
which they had always found to be merely cob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>webs to catch ſmall flies. Accuſtomed to be puniſhed themſelves for every trifle, and often for only being in the way of the rich, or their para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites; when, in fact, had the Pariſians ſeen the execution of a noble, or prieſt, though convicted of crimes beyond the daring of vulgar minds?— When juſtice, or the law, is ſo partial, the day of retribution will come with the red ſky of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, to confound the innocent with the guilty. The mob were barbarous beyond the tiger's cruelty: for how could they truſt a court that had ſo often deceived them, or expect to ſee it's agents puniſhed, when the ſame meaſures were purſuing?</p>
               <p>Let us caſt our eyes over the hiſtory of man, and we ſhall ſcarcely find a page that is not tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by ſome foul deed, or bloody tranſaction. Let us examine the catalogue of the vices of men in a ſavage ſtate, and contraſt them with thoſe of men civilized; we ſhall find, that a barbarian, conſidered as a moral being, is an angel, compared with the refined villain of artificial life. Let us inveſtigate the cauſes which have produced this degeneracy, and we ſhall diſcover, that they are thoſe unjuſt plans of governments, which have been formed by peculiar circumſtances in every part of the globe.—Then let us coolly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially contemplate the improvements, which are gaining ground in the formation of principles of policy; and I flatter myſelf it will be allowed by every humane and conſiderate being, that a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical ſyſtem more ſimple than has hitherto ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſted would effectually check thoſe aſpiring follies, which, by imitation, leading to vice, have baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="380" facs="unknown:029916_0389_0FE30C8BED5404E8"/>
from governments the very ſhadow of juſtice and magnanimity</p>
               <p>Thus had France grown up, and ſickened on the corruption of a ſtate diſeaſed. But, as in medicine there is a ſpecies of complaint in the bowels which works it's own cure, and, leaving the body healthy, gives an invigorated tone to the ſyſtem, ſo there is in politics; and whilſt the agitation of it's regeneration continues, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious humours exuding from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated body will excite a general diſlike and contempt for the nation; and it is only the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical eye, which looks into the nature and weighs the conſequences of human actions, that will be able to diſcern the cauſe, which has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced ſo many dreadful effects.</p>
