            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following Sketch of "The Features of Mr. Jay's Treaty," was made, originally, with a view to aſcertain, for private ſatisfaction, the principles and operation of an Inſtrument, which has excited ſuch extenſive curioſity, and is calculated to produce ſuch important effects. It is publiſhed, however, at the inſtance of ſeveral perſons, who think that the ſubject ſhould be placed in every poſſible light; and that no citizen can be juſtified at this criſis, in ſuppreſſing his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, or in withholding his ſhare of information from the common ſtock. But while it is committed to the preſs, I wiſh it to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered merely as a text, which may hereafter be extended by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, or explained by illuſtration; and though it will give me pleaſure (ſince my ſole object on this occaſion is the inveſtigation of political truth) to ſee it become a ſource of candid animadverſion; I truſt it will not, according to the cuſtom of contending parties, be regarded as an inſtrument of faction, nor be made the foundation of ſlander and abuſe.</p>

                  <hi>I.</hi> The origin and progreſs of the negociation for the Treaty, are not calculated to excite confidence.</head>
               <p n="1">1. THE adminiſtration of our government have, ſeemingly at leaſt, manifeſted a policy favourable to Great Britain, and adverſe to France.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But the houſe of repreſentatives of Congreſs, impreſſed with the general ill conduct of Great Britain towards America, were adopting meaſures, of a mild, though retaliating nature, to obtain redreſs and indemnification. The injuries complained of were, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally, 1ſt. The detention of the weſtern poſts—2dly. The delay in compenſating for the negroes carried off at the cloſe of the war— and 3dly, The ſpoliations committed on our commerce. The reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies propoſed, were, principally, 1ſt. The commercial regulations of Mr. Madiſon—2dly. The non-intercourſe propoſition of Mr. Clarke—3dly. The ſequeſtration motion of Mr. Dayton—4thly. An embargo—and 5thly, Military preparation.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Every plan of the legiſlature was, however, ſuſpended, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther annihilated, by the interpoſition of the executive authority; and Mr. <hi>Jay,</hi> the chief Juſtice of the United States, was taken from his judicial ſeat, to negociate with Great-Britain, under the influence of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028527_0005_0FD934873B806C00"/>the prevailing ſentiment of the people, <hi>for the redreſs of our wrongs.</hi> Query—Are not his commiſſion and the execution of it, at variance? Is any one of our wrongs actually redreſſed? Is not an atonement to Great Britain, for the injuries which ſhe <hi>pretends</hi> to have ſuffered, a preliminary ſtipulation?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The political dogma of Mr. Jay are well known; his predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, in relation to France and Great Britain, has not been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed; and even on the topic of American complaints, his reports, while in the office of ſecretary for foreign affairs, and his adjudications while in the office of chief juſtice, were not calculated to point him out as the ſingle citizen of America, fitted for the ſervice in which he was employed. Query—Do not perſonal feelings too often dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and govern the public conduct of miniſters? But whatever may have been his perſonal diſqualifications, they are abſorbed in the more important conſideration of the apparent violence committed by Mr. Jay's appointment, on the eſſential principles of the conſtitution. That topic, however, has already been diſcuſſed, and we may paſs to the manner of negociating the treaty in England, which was at once obſcure and illuſory. We heard of Mr. Jay's diplomatic ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours; of the royal and miniſterial courteſy which was ſhewn to him, and of the convivial boards to which he was invited: but, no more! Mr. Jay, enveloped by a dangerous confidence <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the intuitive facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his own mind, or the inexhauſtible fund of his diplomatic in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, neither poſſeſſed nor wiſhed for external aid; while the Britiſh negociator, beſides his own acquirements, entered on the points of negociation, fraught with all the auxiliary ſagacity of his brother miniſters, and with all the practical knowledge of the moſt, enlightened merchants of a commercial nation. The reſult corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponds with that inauſpicious ſtate of things. Mr. Jay was driven from the ground of an injured, to the ground of an agreſſing, party; he made atonement for imaginary wrongs, before he was allowed juſtice for real ones; he converted the <hi>reſentments</hi> of the American citizens (under the impreſſions of which he was avowedly ſent to England) into <hi>amity and concord;</hi> and ſeems to have been ſo anxious to rivet a commercial chain about the neck of America, that he even forgot, or diſregarded, a principal item of her own produce, (cotton) in order to make a ſweeping ſacrifice to the inſatiable appetite of his maritime antagoniſt. But the idea of the treaty, given by Mr. Pitt in anſwer to Mr. Fox, who, before he had ſeen, applauded it as an act of liberality and juſtice towards America, was the firſt autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritative alarm to our intereſts and our feelings. "When the treaty is laid before the parliament (ſaid the miniſter) you will beſt judge whether any improper conceſſion has been made to America!"</p>
               <p n="5">5. The treaty being ſent her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> for ratification, the Preſident and the Senate purſue the myſterious plan in which it was negociated. I has been intimated, that till the meeting of the ſenate, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not communicated even to the moſt confidential officers of the government: and the firſt reſolution taken by the ſenate, was to ſtop the lips and ears of its members againſt every poſſibility of giving
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028527_0006_0FD9348D94ED19F8"/>or receiving information. Every man, like Mr. Jay, was preſumed to be inſpired. In the courſe of the diſcuſſion, however, ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences flaſhed from beneath the veil of ſecrecy; and it is conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured that the whole treaty was, at one time, in jeopardy. But the rhetoric of a miniſter (not remarkable for the <hi>volubility of his tongue</hi>) who was brought poſt-haſte from the country; the danger of expoſing to odium and diſgrace the diſtinguiſhed American characters, who would be affected by a total rejection of the treaty; and the feeble, but operative, vote of a member tranſported from the languor and imbecility of a ſick room, to decide in the ſenate a great national queſtion, whoſe merits he had not heard diſcuſſed; triumphed over principle, argument and decorum!</p>
               <p n="6">6. But ſtill the treaty remains <hi>unratified;</hi> for, unleſs the Britiſh government ſhall aſſent to ſuſpend the obnoxious twelfth article, (in favour of which, however, many <hi>patriotic</hi> members declared their readineſs to vote) the whole is deſtroyed by the terms of the ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: and if the Britiſh government ſhall agree to add an article allowing the ſuſpenſion, the whole muſt return for the reconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſenate. But the forms of myſtery are ſtill preſerved by our government; and attempts to deceive the people have been made abroad, upon a vain preſumption, that the treaty could remain <hi>a ſecret,</hi> till it became obligatory as <hi>a law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For inſtance, in <hi>Fenno's</hi> paper of the 25th of June, it is unequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocally declared, "the treaty of amity, commerce and navigation, was ratified yeſterday by the Senate of the United States; and, even while he corrects that miſtake in the paper of the following day, he commits <hi>an error</hi> of a more extraordinary kind (particularly when we conſider that he is the confidential perſon, who printed the treaty for the uſe of the ſenate) by aſſerting, that in the twelfth article, "the United States are prohibited from exporting to Europe from the ſaid ſtates, ſugar, coffee, cotton and cocoa, <hi>the produce of any of the Weſt India iſlands.</hi>" The fact muſt have been known to Mr. Fenno, that the prohibition operates <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>iverſally; whether the prohibited ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles are the produce of the Weſt India iſlands, of the Eaſt Indies, of the United States, or of any other part of the world. The next eſſay to render the envelopements of the treaty ſtill more opaque, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the American Daily Advertiſer, of the 27th of June. The writer (who is ſaid to be a member of the Senate) likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards the ratification, in his introduction, as a perfect one; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giving a gloſs to the general texture of the treaty, he aſcribes the obnoxious principle of the twelfth article, <hi>to an error which, it appears, has been inadvertently introduced.</hi> An error inadvertently introduced into an inſtrument, which was under the conſideration of the chief juſtice of the United States, and the Britiſh miniſter, for a term of eight months! and introduced too, into a part of that very article, which is made the ſole foundation of the whole commercial ſuperſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!! Whenever the twelfth article ceaſes, the treaty declares every other article, except the ten firſt articles, ſhall alſo ceaſe! But the author of that ſketch proceeds one ſtep further—he ſays, "that

               <p n="1">1. The ſecond article provides for the ſurrender of the weſtern poſts in June, 1796; but it ſtipulates, that in the mean time, the citizens of the United States ſhall not ſettle within the precincts and juriſdiction of thoſe poſts; that the Britiſh ſettlers there ſhall hold and enjoy all their property of every kind, real and perſonal; and that when the poſts are ſurrendered, ſuch ſettlers ſhall have an election
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028527_0008_0FD9349278B07F38"/>either to remain Britiſh ſubjects, or to become American citizens. Query—Were not the weſtern poſts, and all their precincts and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, the abſolute property of the United States by the treaty of peace? Query—What equivalent is given for this ceſſion of the terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the United States to a foreign power? Query—How far do the precincts and juriſdiction of the poſts extend? Query—Does not the treaty give an implied aſſent to major Campbell's claim, by adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its language, as far as the falls of the Miami, and to the northern claim upon the territories of New-York and Vermont?</p>
               <p n="2">2. The third article ſtipulates that the two contracting parties may frequent the ports of <hi>either party,</hi> on the eaſtern banks of the Miſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippi. Query—What ports has Great Britain on the eaſtern banks of the Miſſiſſippi?</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third article likewiſe opens an amicable intercourſe on the lakes; but excludes us from their ſea-ports, and the limits of the Hudſon's bay company; and excludes them from navigating our Atlantic rivers, higher than the higheſt port of entry in each. Query —What are the limits of the Hudſon's bay company? Query—What equivalent do the United States obtain for the general freedom of navigation, portage and paſſage? For it muſt be remembered, that the Britiſh rivers penetrate the heart of the country, but of thoſe we can take no advantage; while Great Britain is in fact admitted to all the advantages of which our Atlantic rivers are ſuſceptible.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The ſixth and ſeventh articles provide for ſatisfying every demand which Great Britain has been able, at any time, to make againſt the United States (the payment of the Britiſh debts due be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the war, and the indemnification for veſſels captured within our territorial juriſdiction) but the proviſion made for the American claims upon Great Britain, is not equally explicit or efficient in its terms, nor is it co-extenſive with the object. Query—Why is the demand for the negroes, carried off by the Britiſh troops, ſuppreſſed, waved, or abondoned? The preamble to the treaty recites an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>terminate the differences</hi> between the nations: was not the affair of the negroes a difference between the nations? and how has it been terminated?</p>
               <p n="5">5. The ninth article ſtipulates, that the ſubjects of Great Britain and the citizens of the United States, reſpectively, who now hold lands within the territories of either nation, ſhall hold the lands in the ſame manner as natives do. Query—What is the relative pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of lands ſo held? Query—The effect to revive the claims of Britiſh ſubjects, who, either as traitors or aliens, have forfeited their property within the reſpective ſtates? Query—The operation of ſuch a compact on the internal policy of the union, combined with the ſolemn recognition of a colony of Britiſh ſubjects, profeſſing and owing allegiance to the Britiſh crown, though ſettled within the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged territory of the United States, by virtue of the ſecond article?</p>

Query— Does not this, ſupported by other proviſions, which forbid our chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the commercial ſituation of Great Britain, or impoſing higher duties on her than on other nations, deprive the United States of their beſt means of retaliation and coercion? Query—Is it not taking from America her only weapon of defence; but from Great Britain the leaſt of two weapons which ſhe poſſeſſes? What is the relative proportion held by the citizens of the contracting nations, reſpectively, in the funds, &amp;c. of each other.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The twelfth article opens to our veſſels, not exceeding ſeventy tons, an intercourſe with the Britiſh Weſt India iſlands, during the preſent war, and for two years after: but it prohibits our exporting from the United States, melaſſes, ſugar, cocoa, coffee, or cotton, to any part of the world, whether thoſe articles are brought from Britiſh, French, or Spaniſh iſlands, or even raiſed (as cotton is) within our own territory. Query—Are veſſels of ſeventy tons equal to maintain the moſt beneficial part of our trade with the Weſt Indies, the tranſportation of lumber, &amp;<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Query—Do we not, <hi>in the time of war</hi> (and the continuance of the privelege, for more than two years after the war depends on the ſituation in which his majeſty of Great Britain ſhall then find himſelf in relation to the iſlands) enjoy a greater pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege, under the temporary proclamations of the colonial governors, than this article admits? Query—Have not the articles which we are prohibited from exporting, formed, of late, a valuable part of our trade? Is not cocoa chiefly cultivated by the Spaniards? Is not cotton a ſtaple of America? Is our own own conſumption equal to our importation or growth of the prohibited articles? Will not the want of a vent for any ſurplus quantity, affect the other branches of our commerce, diminiſh the demand for ſhip building, and injure our agriculture? If we are now thrown out of this branch of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying trade, ſhall we be ever able to recover it? and, in ſhort, will not the loſs be of laſting detriment to all our maritime exertions?</p>
               <p n="8">8. The thirteenth article admits us to trade in the Britiſh ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in the Eaſt Indies: but it excludes us from any ſhare in the coaſting trade of that country; it forbids our penetrating the interior of the country, or holding an intercourſe with the natives, unleſs under a licenſe from the local Britiſh government; and it compels us to land all the articles that are there ſhipped, in the United States. Is not China the independent territory of the emperor? Is not Canton an open port acceſſible to all nations? Do we not obtain there, and at independent places in the Eaſt Indies with which we have, at preſent, an uninterrupted communication, tea, porcelain, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Does not a very advantageous part of the trade in that quarter of the globe, conſiſt in the exchange of the products and manufactures of the Eaſt Indies for thoſe of China, and <hi>vice verſa?</hi> Do not our importations of Eaſt India goods far exceed our conſumption? Is not the trade which we carry on with thoſe goods in Europe, highly beneficial?
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028527_0010_0FD9349848BE9620"/>Are not ſugar and coffee a part of our importations from India, and does not the 12th article prohibit our re-exporting them? Does our trade to Europe, founded on the previous intercourſe with India, depend on the Britiſh licence; and can it be maintained, under the diſadvantage of a double voyage? Are we not, every voyage, making favourable impreſſions on the natives of China? Do we not partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, at preſent, in the carrying trade of that country? Does not our intereſt in it increaſe rapidly?</p>
               <p n="9">9. The ſeveral articles that regulate the rights and priveleges of the contracting parties within their reſpective territories, in caſe either of them is engaged in a war, may ceaſe in two years after the preſent war is terminated, and cannot be protracted beyond twelve years. Query—Are not all theſe advantages, in effect, <hi>excluſively favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Great Britain,</hi> a principal maritime power of Europe; often engaged in wars; and intereſted to obtain for her ſhips, her colonies, and herſelf, the ports and ſupplies of this extenſive continent?</p>
               <p>Is it probable that, during the longeſt poſſible exiſtence of this treaty (twelve years) America will be engaged in maritime wars, will want Engliſh ports as a refuge for men of war, or as a retreat for prizes? Or that it will, during that period, be of importance to her objects, to prevent her enemies from arming in Engliſh ports, or ſelling their prizes there?</p>
               <p n="10">10. The twenty-ſecond article provides for ſhips of war being hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitably treated in the ports of the reſpective contracting parties; and that officers ſhall be treated with the reſpect that is due to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions which they bear. Query—Could not the principle of reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procity, as well as humanity, ſuggeſt to Mr. Jay, that ſome provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhould be made to protect our citizen ſailors from the ſangs of Britiſh preſs-gangs in England; and from the horrors of their priſon-ſhips in the Weſt Indies? Were the commiſſions of his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic majeſty of more regard than the liberties of American freemen? Or, was it unknown, that thouſands of our ſailors have been occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally enſlaved by the impreſs tyranny of the Britiſh government? Or, that thouſands have loſt their lives in noxious priſons, while their veſſels were carried into Britiſh ports for "LEGAL ADJUDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATION?"</p>
               <p n="11">11. The fourteenth article provides for a perfect liberty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce and navigation, and for the accommodation of traders; but ſubject always to the laws and ſtatutes of the two countries reſpectively: Query—Are not the laws and ſtatutes of England infinitely more rigid, on the ſubjects of this article, than the laws and ſtatutes of America?</p>

Query—Whether that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion does not manifeſtly ariſe from the proviſions, for admitting a Britiſh colony within our territory, in the neighbourhood of the weſtern poſts; for admitting the whole Britiſh nation, without an equivalent, into a participation of our territory on the eaſtern bank of the Miſſiſſippi; for naturalizing all the holders of lands; for opening a general intercourſe with their traders on the lakes, in the interior of our country, rendering (as it is idly ſaid) the local advantages of each party common to both; for regulating the external trade of the two nations with each other; for admitting citizens to be puniſhed as pirates, who take commiſſions, &amp;c. from a belligerent power, adverſe to either contracting party; for fettering the operations of our treaty with France; for ſurrendering criminals, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The meaſures propoſed by one party to retaliate the injuries offered by Great Britain to our territorial, commercial and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal rights, were oppoſed by the other, preciſely as the treaty oppoſes them. For inſtance:—</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1.) Mr. Madiſon projects a regulation of our commerce with Great Britain, by which the hoſtile ſpirit of that nation, might be contro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>led on the footing of its intereſt. The treaty legitimiſes the oppoſition, which was given to the meaſure in Congreſs, by declaring in article fifteen, "that no other or higher duties ſhall be paid by the ſhips or merchandiſe of the one party, in the ports of the other, than ſuch as are paid by the like veſſels or merchandiſe of all other nations; nor ſhall any other or higher duty be impoſed in one coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try on the importation of any articles of the growth, produce, or manufactures of the other, than are, or ſhall be, payable on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of the like articles of the growth, &amp;c. of any foreign country.</item>
                  <item>(2.) Mr. Clarke propoſes to manifeſt and enforce the public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, by prohibiting all intercourſe between the two nations. The treaty deſtroys the very right to attempt that ſpecies of national denunciation, by declaring in the ſame article, that "no prohibition ſhall be impoſed on the exportation or importation of any articles to or from the territories of the two parties reſpectively, which ſhall not equally extend to all other nations."</item>
                  <item>(3.) But Mr. Dayton moves, and the houſe of repreſentatives ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port his motion, for the ſequeſtration of Britiſh debts, &amp;c. to enſure a fund for paying the ſpoliations committed on our trade. The treaty (without regarding the reſpect due to the commiſſion which is borne by our members of Congreſs) not only deſpoils the government of this important inſtrument to coerce a powerful, yet intereſted adverſary into acts of juſtice, but enters likewiſe into a commentary, which, conſidering the conduct of one of the branches of our legiſlature, Lord Grenville, conſiſtently with decorum, could not have expreſſed, or at leaſt, Mr. Jay, for the ſake of our national dignity, ought not to have adopted. The tenth article declares, that "neither the debts due from individuals of the one nation to individuals of the other,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028527_0012_0FD9349F07FF3DC0"/>nor ſhares nor monies which they may have in the public funds, or in the public or private banks, ſhall ever, in any event of war or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional difference, be ſequeſtered or conſiſcated, <hi>it being unjuſt and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic,</hi> that debts and engagements contracted and made by indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals having conſidence in each other and in their reſpective govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould ever be deſtroyed or impaired by national authority on account of national differences and diſcontents." The terms are very ſimilar to thoſe that gave Mr. Dayton offence in a ſpeech pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by Mr. Ames; and certainly it will be deemed no mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the charge of committing "<hi>an unjuſt and impolitic</hi> act," has been wantonly engrafted upon the moſt ſolemn of all inſtruments. —a public treaty! Query:—Would Lord Grenville have conſented to brand his Royal Maſter with the title of <hi>Great Sea Robber,</hi> if Mr. Jay's urbanity could have permitted him to borrow the epithet from another member of Congreſs, in order to inſert it, in the article that relates to the Britiſh ſpoliations on our trade? But perhaps, Mr. Jay forgot, that the commentary operated as a reflection on the government of the United States, and only meant it as a reproach to Great Britain, for ſequeſtering during the late war, and retaining at this moment, the property belonging to Maryland, lying in the bank of England. It might, likewiſe, be intended as a ſatire upon the parliamentary ſequeſtration of French property in the famous "In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe Act:" or, perhaps, Mr. Jay anticipated the revolution in Holland, and deſigned his commentary as a warning againſt the ſeizing of Dutch property, public and private; which, however, has ſince taken place, in ſpite of his ſolemn admonition.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="3">3. The trials that had occurred relative to the equipment of French privateers in our ports; and the enliſtment of our citizens in the ſervice of the republic, had produced ſome embarraſſment in the courſe of party purſuits. Theſe are obviated by the treaty. The Britiſh nation by which the empreſs of Ruſſia has always been ſupplied with naval officers, and whoſe fleets and armies are always crowded with volunteers from other nations, conſents that her ſubjects ſhall not ſerve againſt us; and ſtipulates that our citizens ſhall not ſerve againſt her. This contract is made with a power actually engaged in a war; and ſeldom more than ſeven years clear of one; by a power at peace, not liable, from her local poſition, and political conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to be involved in war, and in ſtrict alliance with the nation againſt whom the ſtipulation will immediately operate. Captain Barney and the other Americans, who have joined the arms of France, are thus involved in the moſt ſerious dilemma. If they expatriate themſelves, they may poſſibly eſcape the vengeance of the American government; but will that ſave them from the vengeance of Great Britain, whoſe conceſſions on the doctrine of expatriation are not quite ſo liberal? By the bye, it may here be ſeaſonably repeated, that while Mr. Jay was ſo willing to prevent American citizens from <hi>entering</hi> into the ſervice of France, he might ſurely have taken ſome pains to ſecure them from being <hi>preſſed</hi> into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of England. He would have found, on enquiry, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028527_0013_0FD934A240377350"/>of the latter kind are infinitely more numerous than of the former. But it is enough that the meaſure will be introductory of a law, favourable to the view of a party which reprobates every idea of aſſiſting the French, and cultivates every means of conciliating the Britiſh.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It has, likewiſe, been thought by ſome politicians, that the energies of our executive department require every aid that can be given to them, in order more effectually to reſiſt and controul the popular branches of the government. Hence we find the treaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making power employed in that ſervice; and Congreſs cannot exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a legiſlative diſcretion on the prohibited points (though it did not participate in making the ceſſion of its authority) without a decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of war againſt Great Britain. George the third enjoys by the treaty a more complete negative to bind us as ſtates, than he ever claimed over us as colonies.</p>

               <p n="1">1. It is a general principle of the law of nations, that during the exiſtence of a war, neutral powers ſhall not, by favour or by treaty, ſo alter the ſituation of one of the belligerent parties, as to enable him more advantageouſly to proſecute hoſtilities againſt his adverſary. If, likewiſe, a neutral power ſhall refuſe or evade treating with one of the parties, but eagerly enter into a treaty with the other, it is a partiality, that amounts to a breach of neutrality. Theſe poſitions may be ſupported by the authority of the moſt eſteemed writers on the ſubject; but it will be ſufficient in the preſent caſe, to cite the conduct of Great Britain herſelf. Thus, it has been adjudged by Lord <hi>Mansfield,</hi> "that if a neutral ſhip trades to a French colony, with all the privileges of a French ſhip, <hi>and is thus adopted and naturalized,</hi> it muſt be looked upon as a French ſhip, liable to be taken."

Great Britain alledges (when it is injurious to France) that trading with the French iſlands, <hi>on a footing not allowed before the war,</hi> is a breach of neutrality, and cauſe of conſiſcation: and, therefore, Great Britain muſt alſo admit, at leaſt America will not deny, that trading with the Britiſh iſlands, on a footing not allowed before the war; or, in different words, altering and enlarging the commercial relations of the two countries, is equally a breach of our neutrality towards France. When the ſword is found to cut both ways, the party who uſes it, has no right to complain.</p>

                  <item>(2.) <hi>Great Britain gains ſupplies for her Weſt India colonies;</hi> and <hi>that</hi> for a period almoſt limited to the continuance of the war, under circumſtances which incapacitate her from furniſhing the colonial ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies herſelf; and, indeed, compel her to invite the aid of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in furniſhing proviſions for her own domeſtic ſupport. The ſupplies may be carried to the iſlands either in <hi>American</hi> bottoms <hi>not exceeding ſeventy tons,</hi> or in <hi>Britiſh</hi> bottoms of <hi>any tonnage.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>(3.) <hi>Great Britain gains an advantage over France, by prohibiting the exportation of ſugar, &amp;c.</hi> in conſequence of which the colonies of France muſt, in a great meaſure, remain unſupplied with proviſions, &amp;c. as they can only in general pay for them in thoſe articles, <hi>whoſe uſe is confined to the American conſumption.</hi> It will be remembered, that the produce of the French iſlands has of late conſtituted a great part of our European remittances. If, therefore, that trade is cut off, and at the ſame time, beſides employing <hi>our own ſmall craft</hi> of ſeventy tons, Great Britain is allowed, <hi>to any extent of tonnage,</hi> to be our Weſt India factor, it is obvious that our conſumption of ſugar, coffee, &amp;c. &amp;c. will be abundantly ſupplied, without maintaining an intercourſe with the French, or even with the Eaſt Indies, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure any of thoſe articles. Perhaps this method, though leſs bold, will be more effectual to prevent our furniſhing the French iſlands with proviſion, than declaring them to be in a ſtate of blockade, and ſeizing the veſſels that attempt to viſit them.</item>
                  <item>(4.) <hi>It is another important gain to Great Baitain</hi> (which might, likewiſe, have been adverted to under the feature of reciprocity) <hi>that, to any extent of tonnage, her veſſels may carry on the Weſt India trade for us,</hi> either to ſupply our domeſtic conſumption, or European en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements,

But whatever may be thought of the benefit of acquiring for America even this ſcanty participation in the Weſt India trade, no one (after the rejection of the twelfth article) will deny that the whole meaſure changes the relative ſituation of the two countries, avowedly in favour of Great Britain, and operatively injurious to France; and every ſuch change is derogatory to our boaſted neutral character.</item>
                  <item>(5.) <hi>The admiſſion of Great Britain to all the commercial advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the moſt favoured nation, and the reſtraints impoſed upon our le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative independence,</hi> as ſtated in the <hi>party feature</hi> of the treaty, are proofs of predilection and partiality in the American government, which cannot fail to improve the reſources of Great Britain, and to impair the intereſts, as well as the attachments, of France.</item>

It may properly be here remarked, that Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and Denmark have obtained, by a ſpirited reſiſtance, an actual indemnification for the ſeizures which have heretofore taken place, and an exemption from all ſuch outrages in future; while America has only put thoſe which are paſt, <hi>in a train of negociation,</hi> and has given a <hi>legitimate effect</hi> to thoſe which are to come. The order, which, the Engliſh gazettes ſay, has recently been iſſued for ſeizing American proviſion-ſhips, on their paſſage to France, ought not, therefore, to be complained of, as it is merely an exerciſe, by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation, of the right granted by the treaty.</item>
                  <item>(7.) <hi>Great Britain has gained the right of preventing our Citizens from being volunteers in the armies or ſhips of France!</hi> This is not ſimply the grant of a new right to Great Britain, but is, at the ſame time, a poſitive deprivation of a benefit, hitherto enjoyed by France. Neither the laws of nations, nor our municipal conſtitution and laws, prohibited our citizens from <hi>going to another country,</hi> and <hi>there,</hi> either for the ſake of honour, reward, or inſtruction, ſerving in a foreign navy, or army:—Colonel <hi>Oſwald</hi> and many others have done it:— Captain <hi>Barney</hi> and many others are doing it.

It would be curious, however, to reflect on the very different motives, which muſt juſtify (if the idea of juſtification could, in the late inſtance, be at all admiſſible) theſe analogous grants. The conceſſion to France was made <hi>when we were at war, and ſhe was not;</hi> it was made upon a certainty of <hi>reciprocal advantage;</hi> and it was made <hi>as a price</hi> for obtaining the aid of <hi>that gallant nation,</hi> in the eſtabliſhment of our independence.

When we were making treaties with Holland, Pruſſia, &amp;c. did we not expreſsly exclude them from ſuch important, and, as we have already ſeriouſly experienced, ſuch dangerous privileges?</item>
               </list>
               <p>But it will be aſked, perhaps what mighty benefit has Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gained, in this caſe, at the expense of France, ſince the prior ſimilar privileges of France are excluſive? <hi>Anſwer:</hi>—That as the privilege of Great Britain will operate againſt every other nation, it will immediately affect the French republic's alliance, offenſive and defenſive, with the United Provinces, which preceded the ratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at leaſt, of the treaty: and it may, eventually, have the ſame pernicious influence in relation to Pruſſia, Spain and Portugal, whoſe diſpoſition to change ſides, in the preſent war, has been unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally expreſſed. Thus, though Holland and Pruſſia made treaties with us, long before Great Britain would admit the idea of a nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation, and though Spain and Portugal are the only cuſtomers, who furniſh us with the ready money balance, for the very purpoſe of paying our annual accumulation of debt to Britain, the harbours of America are open to their veſſels <hi>as prizes,</hi> but ſhut to them as <hi>friends:</hi> They may be brought hither and ſold by their enemies: but if they have captured their enemy, all, but common neceſſaries, ſhall be denied to them! The habits, bias, and opinions of a people, ought not to be altogether diſregarded in making a treaty. What honeſt, feeling American, could patiently ſee an Engliſhman, <hi>our ſunſhine ally,</hi> bringing into our ports, <hi>as prizes,</hi> the ſhips of Holland, <hi>our ally in the times that tried min's ſouls;</hi>—a republic, indiſſolubly

Query—Whether facilitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the means of ſupplying the Britiſh forces in the Weſt Indies, will not be the effect of the arrangements relative to the trade with the Britiſh iſlands? Query—Whether reſtraining our intercourſe with the French iſlands, as a conſequence of the treaty already predicated, will not expoſe them to want, and of courſe to the neceſſity of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their enemies?

                  <item>(2.) By our treaty with France, and indeed with ſeveral other nations, <hi>it is expreſsly ſtipulated, that free veſſels</hi> ſhall <hi>make free goods.</hi> At the time of entering into the ſtipulation, and even at this moment, the maritime ſtrength of France (always ſuperior to that of Denmark and Sweden, which has, under ſimilar circumſtances, been ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful) could command the reſpect of the world for her engagments. It is true, America neither was, nor is, in a ſituation to produce the ſame complaiſance; and, on the ground of that weakneſs, France has, hitherto, candidly diſpenſed with a ſtrict performance of the treaty. But though America cannot <hi>enforce,</hi> ſhe ought not to <hi>aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> her engagements: ſhe may ſubmit to imperious neceſſity, but <hi>ſhe cannot voluntarily bring into queſtion</hi> the right of protecting, as a neutral power, the property of France; while France is not only ready and able to afford her property the ſtipulated protection, but, in confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the ſtipulation, actually <hi>allows the property of Great Britain to paſs free, under the ſanction of the American flag.</hi> When, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the treaty with Great Britain <hi>agrees,</hi> that within two years after the termination of the exiſting war, <hi>it ſhall be diſcuſſed</hi> "whether in any, and what caſes, neutral veſſels ſhall protect enemies' property" —<hi>does it not claſh with our previous promiſe to France, that free ſhips ſhall make free goods?</hi> And when the treaty with Great Britain, in formal and explicit terms, <hi>further agrees,</hi> "that in all caſes where veſſels ſhall be captured or detained, on ſuſpicion of having on board enemies' property, &amp;c. <hi>the part which belongs to the enemy ſhall be made prize"</hi>—Is not this <hi>an evident colliſion with our previous agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with France,</hi> and with the ſecurity which Britiſh property enjoys in conſequence of it? While France adheres to her treaty, by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting

                     <hi>Britiſh goods</hi> to be protected by American bottoms, is it ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, honourable, or conſiſtent, on our part, <hi>to enter voluntarily into a compact with the enemies of France,</hi> for permitting them to take <hi>French goods</hi> our of our veſſels? We may not be able <hi>to prevent,</hi> but ought we to <hi>agree</hi> to the proceeding?

                  <item>(3.) By enumerating, as contraband articles, in the treaty with Great Britain, certain articles which are declared free in the treaty with France, <hi>we may, conſiſtently with the latter, ſupply Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but, conſiſtently with the former, we cannot ſupply France.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Thus, <hi>our treaty with France</hi> (and, indeed, every treaty which we have) expreſsly declares, that, "in general, all proviſions which ſerve for the nouriſhment of mankind and ſuſtenance of life; further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, all kinds of cotton, hemp, flax, tar, pitch, ropes, cables, ſail cloths, anchors and any part of anchors, alſo ſhips, maſts, planks, boards and beams of what trees ſoever; and all other things proper either for building, or repairing ſhips, and all other goods what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, which have not been worked into the form of any inſtrument for war, by land or by ſea, <hi>ſhall not be reputed contraband.</hi>"</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The treaty with Great Britain</hi> expreſsly declares, "that timber for ſhip building, tar or rozin, copper in ſheets, ſails, hemp and cordage, and generally whatever may ſerve directly to the equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of veſſels, unwrought iron, and fir planks only excepted, <hi>ſhall be objects of confiſcation, whenever they are attempted to be carried to an enemy.</hi>"</p>
               <p>Whether this ſtipulation can be conſidered as founded on a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>reciprocity,</hi> ſince the articles declared to be contraband are <hi>among our principal exports,</hi> but <hi>among the principal imports of Great Britain,</hi> might have been adverted to, in tracing a former feature of the treaty; but let it be now candidly anſwered, whether it is not <hi>in colliſion</hi> with our previous engagements with France? The right to make ſuch a ſtipulation, is not, at preſent, controverted; but only the aſſertion, that <hi>exerciſing the right does not claſh in any degree</hi> with the terms and ſpirit of the French treaty. France exempts thoſe important materials of our commerce from confiſcation, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of all the world: Great Britain condemns them to confiſcation, whenever they ſhall be carried to her enemies; and the compact is made, while France is one of her enemies!!</p>

               <p n="1">1. That the friendſhip and favour of France will be affected by the formation of ſo heterogeneous an alliance with her moſt implacable enemy, cannot be doubted, if we reaſon upon any ſcale applicable to the policy of nations, or the paſſions of man. From that republic, therefore, if not an explicit renunciation of all connection with the United States, we may at leaſt expect an alteration of conduct: and,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:028527_0019_0FD934B048E12D98"/>finding the ſucceſs which has flowed from the hoſtile treatment that Great Britain has ſhown toward us, ſhe may be, at length, tempted to endeavour at <hi>extorting from fear,</hi> what ſhe has not been able to obtain <hi>from affection.</hi> She will, probably, declare Great Britain in a ſtate of blockade, for the purpoſe of ſeizing our veſſels in Europe; and ſhe may inſtitute courts for "legal adjudication," in order to confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate our veſſels in the Weſt Indies. <hi>Great Britain will then chuckle at the ſcene.</hi> No one can doubt that our embarraſments will gratify, not only the avowed objects, but the latent reſentments, of that nation. Even if ſhe could obliterate the memory of our revolution, ſhe cannot, with pleaſure, behold the ſucceſsful experiment of a republican ſyſtem of government; nor the rapid advances of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial competitor. The moment ſhe has produced a quarrel be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween America and France, ſhe may exclaim, <hi>"Delenda eſt Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thago."</hi> America is again a colony! How different were the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and diſpoſitions of our tried friend! That our government ſhould preſerve its purity and independence—that our commerce and agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture ſhould attain their zenith—were views <hi>once</hi> congenial with the policy and affections of the French nation: Heart, head, and hand, ſhe would have joined in promoting them, againſt the arts and enmities of all the reſt of the world!

During the war, we, likewiſe, formed a ſeaſonable and ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able treaty with the United Netherlands; and, ſhortly after the war, treaties were eſtabliſhed with Swedenm Pruſſia, &amp;c. But in order to avoir <hi>even the appearance of claſhing or colliſion</hi> with the French treaty, the powers, thus early in courting our alliance, were not allowed thoſe privileges of aſylum for themſelves, and of excluding their enemies from our ports, which are conceded in the projected treaty to Great Britain. Have thoſe nations no cauſe for jealouſy and reproach? What principle of policy, or juſtice, can vindicate the partiality and predilection, that has been thus ſhown?</p>
               <p n="3">3. But the projected treaty (after an affected recognition of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exiſting public treaties) declares, that while Great Britain and America continue in amity, no future treaty ſhall be made, inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the articles, that grant the high and dangerous privileges, that have been mentioned. Every nation of the earth (except France) is thus ſacrificed to the pride and intereſt of Great Britain. And with what motive, or upon what conſideration, is the ſacrifice made? It has been ſtated in a former, and will be more fully ſhewn in a future, feature of Mr. Jay's treaty, that the United States do not enjoy any equivalent for this, nor for any other, conceſſion which is made to Great Britain: But the miſchief does not end with the folly of a lop-ſided bargain. By granting theſe excluſive privileges to Great Britain, by declaring that no commercial favour
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028527_0020_0FD934B8E1EC7A90"/>ſhall be conferred on other nations, without her participating in them, we have thrown away the fureſt means of purchaſing, on any emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, the good will and good offices of any other power: We cannot even improve the terms of our old treaty with France. For all the advantages of trade that Spain, Portugal, Holland, &amp;c. might, and probably would, upon a liberal footing of reciprocity, have given us,—what have we now left, to offer as the baſis of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociation and compact?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The alteration which the treaty makes in the relative ſituation of ſeveral nations with America, and the conduct, that is likely to be purſued by thoſe nations, in order to counteract its effect, merit ſerious reflection. Will Spain ſee without ſome ſolicitude, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition which we have made with Great Britain, of our territory on the eaſtern bank of the Miſſiſſipi? How would our projected treaty work, if France ſhould recover Pondicherry, &amp;c. in the Eaſt Indies; ſhould ſubdue and retain the Weſt India iſlands; ſhould ſtipulate with Spain for the ceſſion of Louiſiana; and ſhould conquer Nova Scotia? The curious <hi>cordon</hi> with which we have allowed Great Britain to circumvent us (and of which more will be ſaid hereafter) being thus broken, how are we to calculate the conſequences?</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſidering the Indians as a foreign nation, is not the treaty calculated to exalt the character of Great Britain, and to depreciate the character of America, throughout the ſavage world? What right has Great Britain to negociate for Indians, within the limits of our juriſdiction? Suppoſe the exiſting weſtern poſts ſurrendered, may not Great Britain eſtabliſh other poſts in a contiguous or more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ſtation? Is ſhe not left at liberty to purſue the fur trade in our territory as well as her own? Will not her enterprize in traffic, ſuperior capital and experience, enable her to monopolize that trade?

For inſtance—it was neceſſary and politic, in the ſtate of our affairs at the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the revolution, to pay a premium for the friendſhip and alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of France: we could not have inſured ſucceſs without the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operation of that nation: and as <hi>the price</hi> that we paid for it was not greater than <hi>the benefit</hi> that we derived from it, we cannot now, with juſtice, cavil at our bargain. But was the inducement to form an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with Great Britain, of a nature equally momentous? Is the advantage flowing from the ſacrifices that are made, equally compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatory? Why ſhould we, at this auſpicious ſeaſon of our affairs, ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to undermine the fundamental maxim of our domeſtic happineſs, <hi>by wilfully obtruding on the great world of politics, or wantonly involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves in the political intrigues and the ſquabbles of Europen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</hi> Suppoſe (as it is often alleged and ſometimes proved) that our treaty with France is productive of inconveniences; will it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the political, any more than in the phyſical or moral world, that by multiplying the ſources of evil, we ſhall get rid of the evil it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? If, according to the <hi>quondam</hi> opinion of the friends of a Britiſh alliance, our commerce has been reſtrained in its operations; or if our government has been menaced in its peace and ſtability, by a practical developement of <hi>the terms</hi> of our treaty with France, ſhall we better our ſituation, becauſe we make <hi>another</hi> treaty <hi>upon the ſame terms</hi> with Great Britain; and furniſh <hi>two</hi> nations, inſtead of <hi>one,</hi> with an opportunity to perplex and diſtreſs us in purſuing our natural and laudable policy—<hi>the policy of exchanging commodities, and living in peace and amity with all the inhabitants of the earth; doing juſtice to, and in receiving it from, every power we are connected with!</hi>

<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028527_0022_0FD934BCC017A6B0"/>theſe ſtrictures will be ungracious and unprofitable: but they claim a candid attention from <hi>the patriot,</hi> who remembers, that when <hi>the parent</hi> ſought to deſtroy, <hi>the friend</hi> interpoſed to ſave; and from the <hi>ſtateſman,</hi> who poſſeſſes too much wiſdom to be influenced by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, and too much fortitude to be controuled by fear.</p>
               <p>Are the <hi>intereſts and happineſs</hi> of the United States involved in the permanent eſtabliſhment of a republican government? Yes:—Then ſhe ought rather to cultivate the friendſhip of a republic, actuated by a fellow feeling, than the alliance of a monarchy impreſſed with jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy and apprehenſion. Are <hi>the intereſt and happineſs</hi> of the United States connected with her territorial and political independence? Yes: —Then ſhe ought rather to fortify herſelf by an alliance with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe territorial juriſdiction, and phyſical characteriſtics, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude the poſſibility of colliſion; than attach herſelf to a nation whoſe language, manners and habits, facilitate the execution of every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to encroach; and whoſe territorial poſſeſſions are in an irritat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and dangerous contact with our own. Are <hi>the intereſt and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs</hi> of America to be promoted by an active employment of the vaſt ſtore of <hi>materials of the firſt neceſſity,</hi> which nature has beſtowed on her; by the extenſion of her commerce; and by the freedom of her navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation? Yes:—Then ſhe ought rather to court the countenance and protection of a nation, whoſe occaſions of envy are comparatively few;—whoſe temptations are to foſter, not to counteract, our ſchemes of commercial opulence and enterpriſe;—and whoſe impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial glory and exiſtence do not depend upon a claim of univerſal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime ſuperiority;—rather than conſent to baſk beneath the baneful ſhade of an alliance with a nation, whoſe very exiſtence is, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the tremendous ſtake in oppoſition to our proſperity: and whoſe embraces, like the embraces of the tyrant's image, may be rendered the moſt effectual inſtruments of torture and deſtruction. Are <hi>the intereſt and happineſs</hi> of the United States dependant on the cordiality of their union, and the permanency of their government? And again—Do that cordiality and that permanency, depend upon the confidence and mutual good underſtanding, which ſubſiſt between the people who formed the government, and the officers whom the people have appointed to adminiſter it? Yes:—Then it would be the part of duty, as well as policy, in thoſe officers to follow <hi>the una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous ſentiment of the people,</hi> by preferring a liberal and faithful alliance with France, to a conſtrained and hypocritical alliance with Great Britain.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The firſt ſtriking effect of the treaty, <hi>to endanger the intereſts, and diſturb the happineſs</hi> of the United States, may be detected by a geographical ſketch of the <hi>cordon, or line of circumvallation, with which it enables Great Britain to fetter and encloſe us.</hi> The proximity of Canada and the weſtern poſts, has heretofore been a cauſe of great uneaſineſs; but that is a trifling ſource of vexation, compared with what we ſhall have in future to encounter. Suppoſe ten thouſand <hi>radii</hi> were drawn diverging from the centre of the United States; not one of them could eſcape the conventional circle of Britiſh territory,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028527_0023_0FD934BDC8A87610"/>juriſdiction and occupancy. Has an American occaſion to travel to the eaſt or the north? <hi>The barriers of Nova Scotia and Canada</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves. Is it his wiſh to penetrate the great weſtern wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? <hi>A new ſet of Britiſh poſts</hi> will intercept his progreſs, even if he ſhall be allowed peaceably to paſs <hi>the Britiſh colony</hi> within the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts and juriſdiction of Detroit. Does buſineſs require him to croſs, or float down, the Miſſiſſippi? He may evade the vigilance of the Spaniard, but he will find the eaſtern bank of the river monopolized by Britiſh traders, and probably protected by Britiſh gun-boats. He is in hopes, however, to avoid all difficulty by a paſſage on the ocean? Alas! our Atlantic harbours are crowded with prizes to Britiſh privateers, and our ſea coaſt is lined with Britiſh cruiſers! Yet, let us for a moment imagine, that this ill fated traveller has ſurmounted his <hi>domeſtic</hi> obſtacles, whither can he fly, to be emanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated from the <hi>foreign</hi> juriſdiction of Great Britain? In the Weſt Indies, his <hi>cock boat</hi> is meaſured and ſteered, according to the ſcale and courſe preſcribed by the treaty. In the Eaſt Indies he can hardly exchange a commodity, or make a ſingle acquaintance, without the Britiſh licenſe. In Europe, if, during a Britiſh war, he carries goods belonging to an enemy of Great Britain, they will be ſeized as prize; if he takes ſhip-timber, tar, rozin, &amp;c. they are liable to be confiſcated as contraband; and if his cargo conſiſts of proviſions, the Britiſh may take it, <hi>by treaty, at their own market price!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>One idea more about the boundary of the United States. Before the revolution, Great Britain had projected that general arrangement and diviſion of her colonial poſſeſſions in America, which ſhe has ſince, upon a ſmaller ſcale, carried into execution with reſpect to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada. The territory then intended to be allotted to the government of the Canadas, was extended by a line running along the northern boundaries of the eaſtern colonies, along the weſtern boundary of Pennſylvania, and along the courſes of the Ohio, into the Miſſiſſippi. Since we are left at a loſs for a poſitive definition of <hi>the precincts and juriſdiction of the weſtern poſts, as ceded by the treaty to the ſettlers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Britiſh titles,</hi> may we not conjecture, that Great Britain contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates the territorial extent of her original project? Does not major Campbell's unexpected pretenſion, and the conſtant claim of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, <hi>at the inſtigation of the Britiſh,</hi> to eſtabliſh the Ohio as a boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary between them and the United States, give ſome countenance to ſuch a conjecture?</p>
               <p n="4">4. But ſhould an American, not ſtimulated by the deſire of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling into foreign countries, be content to proſecute the objects of his honeſt induſtry within the Britiſh territorial circle, bounding and conſtituting <hi>his own home,</hi> will his condition be much better than the condition of his itinerant fellow citizen? What with the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Britiſh colonies and Britiſh ware-houſes; the naturalization of Britiſh land-holders; and, in ſhort, the <hi>unqualified admiſſion</hi> of Engliſhmen, owing allegiance to the Britiſh crown, throughout our lakes, rivers and territory, while we are <hi>excluded</hi> from their ſea-ports, company-lands, &amp;c. &amp;c. an American will hardly be able to find el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-room
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028527_0024_0FD934BF52748490"/>for himſelf and family. Their pecuniary capital being larger; their means being eaſier; their experience being greater,— they muſt, inevitably, under ſuch circumſtances, become our mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, manufacturers, farmers, &amp;c. &amp;c. They will import for us, <hi>in their veſſels,</hi> all the products and fabrics of Europe, Aſia and Africa —They will export for us, <hi>in their veſſels,</hi> every article that our ſoil can furniſh; our merchants will dwindle into clerks; our huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will degenerate into the condition of the feudal villienage; and thus, in a ſhort courſe of years, <hi>America will probably exhibit the aſtoniſhing ſpectacle of a country poſſeſſed, cultivated, and enjoyed by aliens!</hi> The ancient inhabitants of Great Britain, in a ſimilar manner, invited thoſe Saxons to their iſland as <hi>friends and allies,</hi> who ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards became their <hi>conquerors and maſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. In ſuch a ſtate of things, <hi>the intereſt and happineſs</hi> of the United States muſt languiſh and expire! At firſt the American mind will be corroded, by contraſting the elevation of <hi>the gueſt</hi> with the depreſſion of <hi>the hoſt.</hi> A ſtruggle will probably enſue; but the influence of wealth, and the patronage of extenſive commercial and manufactural inſtitutions, &amp;c. <hi>will even divide the Americans themſelves;</hi> and, <hi>by dividing,</hi> capacitate the Britiſh ſettlers to rule them. Is this an idle phantom—a viſionary ſuggeſtion? No! For, is not a great part of our trade, at this moment, monopoliſed by Britiſh ſubjects, under <hi>the maſk</hi> of American citizenſhip? Has not the influence of Britiſh credits, and Britiſh politics already formed a conſiderable party in our government, and among our merchants? Diſguiſe it as you will— let pride deny, and ſhame ſuppreſs the ſentiment—ſtill, it is too evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to every candid and diſcerning obſerver, that the only ſubſiſting difference in the opinions and conduct of the citizens of America, ariſes from this fatal cauſe. Why, at the moment of reprobating <hi>ſelf-created ſocieties for civil purpoſes,</hi> do we gladly ſee the formation of <hi>ſelf-created ſocieties for military purpoſes;</hi> the city cohorts and Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian bands? Why are our merchants, who ſo anxiouſly called forth the voice of their fellow citizens in applauding the proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of neutrality, ſo circumſpect and ſo torpid in giving their teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony about the treaty? How comes it, that amidſt the acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the 4th of July, the treaty is <hi>toaſted</hi> in the little circle of Engliſh manufacturers, on the banks of the Paſſayik; and at the convivial tables of the Engliſh emigrants on the plains of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſee? How comes it that every man who prefers France to Great Britain—republicaniſm to monarchy,—is denominated <hi>Antifederaliſt, Jacobin, Diſorganiſer, Miſcreant,</hi> &amp;c. while men of another hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour arrogantly and excluſively aſſume the titles of <hi>Federaliſts, Friends to order,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c.? But let every hopeſt American reflect ſeriouſly and ſeaſonably, upon the means of promoting <hi>the intereſt and happineſs</hi> of the United States, and he will diſdain, as well as dread, to augment, by the adventitious force of treaties, that paramount intereſt, which Great Britain has already inſidiouſly acquired in our commerce, navigation, manufactures, territory, and government.</p>

6. Beſides the injury eventually to be apprehended from theſe cauſes, the treaty is calculated to impair <hi>the intereſt and happineſs</hi> of the United States, by producing an immediate and violent concuſſion in the federal atmoſphere. For,</p>
               <p>It ranſacks the archives of our revolutionary tranſactions; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judges the ſolemn judgments of our courts of juſtice.</p>
               <p>It condemns individuals to the payment of debts, from which they had previouſly been diſcharged by law.</p>
               <p>It makes the government of the union reſponſible for the contracts of private citizens, and the defalcations of bankrupts.</p>
               <p>It diſregards the freedom of our commerce and navigation: and it reſtrains the uſe of our ſtaple commodities.</p>
               <p>It does <hi>not</hi> exact a juſt indemnification for the detention of the weſtern poſts.</p>
               <p>It does <hi>not</hi> require the payment, ſtipulated by the preceding treaty, <hi>for the value</hi> of the negroes carried off at the cloſe of the war.</p>
               <p>It does <hi>not</hi> provide for the freedom and ſafety of our ſeamen, in their intercourſe with the Britiſh dominions.</p>
               <p>Let any one of theſe propoſitions be ſeparately analyſed, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cauſe will be found to excite and juſtify popular diſſatisfaction; but view them combined, and the mind is ſhocked with an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that <hi>the ratification of the treaty, may be the death-warrant of the union!</hi>

                  <hi>VIII.</hi> The Britiſh Treaty and the Conſtitution of the United States are at war with each other.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Self-preſervation is the firſt law of ſociety, as well as of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals: It is the radical principle of all political compacts. Nations (ſays <hi>Vattel</hi>) are bound to guard <hi>their own preſervation, and to purſue their own perfection.</hi> We have inceſſant opportunities, indeed, of obſerving the operation of this univerſal rule; in animals of <hi>inſtinct,</hi> as well as in animals of <hi>reaſon;</hi> in the world of <hi>things,</hi> as well as in the world of <hi>beings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Self-preſervation, however, is a relative idea: it relates to the nature of the animal; to the conſtitution of the ſociety. A man may loſe his <hi>human character,</hi> without deſtroying his <hi>vital exiſtence;</hi> and a government may be changed <hi>in its eſſence,</hi> without being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>in its forms.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. So, likewiſe, without open aſſault or poſitive violence, the ſources of animal life may be poiſoned, by the imperceptible conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations of a luxurious habit: ſo, without the aid of terror or force, the legitimate foundations of government may be undermined, by the inſidious encroachment of the rulers, and by the ſedative acquieſcence of the people. Governments, indeed, have too generally proved to be a kind of <hi>political chryſalis,</hi> paſſing, by progreſſive tranſmutations, from the grub of pure democracy, to the butterfly of abſolute mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</p>

4. But it will not <hi>yet</hi> be denied in America, that as the people have the ſole right to conſtitute their government, the rule of <hi>ſelf-preſervation</hi> requires that the government ſhould be maintained, in practice as well as in theory, <hi>ſuch as they have conſtituted it.</hi> To render it, by any conſtruction of the written articles of our ſocial compact, <hi>other than a republican government,</hi> would be as fatal a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as daring uſurpation, or military conqueſt, could atchieve. For, what real difference does it make to a nation, whether its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is <hi>ſeized upon</hi> by an enterprizing individual, as in the Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh revolution of 1770; or <hi>overthrown</hi> by a triumphant warrior, as in the recent extinction of the Poliſh monarchy; or <hi>voted out of doors,</hi> as in the diſorganizing edicts of the long parliament of England? Thus, likewiſe, for one department of the government to aſſume the authority of another; or, by conſtructive amplifications of its own juriſdiction, ſo to monopolize the attributes of government, as to render the other departments uſeleſs and inefficient, muſt ever be deemed an effectual ſubverſion of any conſtitution. The mode of diſtributing and organizing the powers of government, as well as the conſideration of the nature and extent of the powers to be delegated, eſſentially belongs to the people; and in the body politic, as well as in the body natural, whenever any particular member abſorbs more than its allotted portion of the aliment, that is deſtined to vivify and invigorate the whole, debility and diſeaſe will infallibly enſure. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the emperors had uſurped the functions, privileges and powers of the ſenate, and of the popular magiſtrates of Rome, they preſerved the formalities of the commonwealth, but they trampled on the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people. Though the parliaments of France had long been deprived of every deliberative faculty, as the repreſentatives of the people, they were ſummoned to the laſt, as the miniſterial officers of the monarch, for the purpoſe of regiſtering his edicts.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The government of the United States, being then theoretically a <hi>republican government,</hi> and with great propriety denominated a <hi>go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of departments,</hi> let us proceed to examine how far <hi>the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of ſelf-preſervation,</hi> and the duty of <hi>purſuing the perfection</hi> of our political ſyſtem, are involved in the ratification of the projected treaty with Great Britain.</p>
               <p>The ſecond ſection of the ſecond article of the conſtitution ſays, that, "The Preſident ſhall have power, by and with the advice and conſent of the ſenate, to make treaties, provided two-thirds of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators preſent concur."</p>
               <p>To the exerciſe of this power no immediate qualification, or reſtriction, is attached: but muſt we therefore ſuppoſe that the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Preſident and ſenate, like the juriſdiction aſcribed to the Britiſh parliament, is omnipotent? To place the authority of our Preſident and ſenate on the ſame footing with the prerogative of the king of Great Britain, will not be commenſurate with the objects to which the treaty extends. It muſt be remembered, that the treaty of peace, by which the rights of ſovereignty and ſoil were ceded by the king of Great Britain to the United States, was negociated
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028527_0027_0FD934C85CA2A488"/>and ratified under the poſitive ſanction of an act of parliament: And it is expreſsly ſtated in <hi>Vattel,</hi> that the king of Great Britain cannot, by <hi>treaty,</hi> confer the rights of citizenſhip on an alien. B. 1. c. 19. ſ. 214. Now, Mr. Jay's treaty does both theſe things (as will be hereafter demonſtrated) without the intervention of the legiſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the union.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The conſequence of admitting this unqualified claim to omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, in tranſacting the buſineſs of the nation, would be ſo hoſtile to the principle and preſervation of our government, that it is an indiſpenſable duty <hi>(obſia principiis)</hi> to controvert and reſiſt it. Whenever the Preſident and two-thirds of the Senate ſhall be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to counteract the conduct of the houſe of repreſentatives; whenever they may wiſh to enforce a particular point of legiſlation; or whenever they ſhall be diſpoſed to circumſcribe the power of a ſucceeding Congreſs; a treaty with a foreign nation, nay, a talk with a ſavage tribe, affords the ready and effectual inſtrument for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing their views; ſince the treaty or the talk will conſtitute the ſupreme law of the land. That <hi>ſuch things may happen,</hi> let the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Mr. Jay's miſſion and negociation teſtify.</p>
               <p n="7">7. If the extraordinary <hi>treaty-making power</hi> is paramount to the ordinary <hi>legiſlative power</hi>—ſupercedes its exerciſe—and embraces all its objects; let us endeavour to trace whither the propoſition will carry us.</p>
               <p>The fifth article of the conſtitution veſts a power in two-thirds of both houſes of Congreſs, to <hi>propoſe amendments to the conſtitution.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe that a defect in our judiciary, or in any other depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, operated injuriouſly to a foreign nation,—could the Senate, and Preſident, uniting with that foreign nation, and excluding the houſe of repreſentatives <hi>propoſe an amendment upon the ſubject?</hi> If they could by theſe means <hi>originate,</hi> might they not by other means <hi>effectuate,</hi> alterations in the fundamental points of our government; and make, in fact, a new conſtitution for us?</p>
               <p>By the eighth ſection of the firſt article, <hi>Congreſs is</hi> empowered to <hi>borrow money</hi> on the credit of the United States.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe it was deemed expedient to ſubſidize Portugal, inſtead of building frigates, to keep the Algerines within the ſtreights of the Mediterranean:—Could two-thirds of the Senate and the Preſident, either borrow, or guarantee a loan for that purpoſe <hi>by treaty?</hi>

               <p>The ſame ſection empowers <hi>Congreſs</hi> to <hi>coin money,</hi> to regulate the value thereof, and of <hi>foreign coin,</hi> and fix the <hi>ſtandards of weights and meaſures.</hi>

Suppoſe the Birmingham manufacturers offered, on a cheap plan, to ſupply us with coin?

               <p>By the conſtitution, <hi>Congreſs</hi> has the power to conſtitute tribunals inferior to the ſupreme court.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe Great Britain deſired, for the future, as well as for the paſt, to eſtabliſh a tribunal of her own judges in America, for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding controverſies between Britiſh ſubjects and American citizens: —Could this be accompliſhed through the medium of a treaty?</p>
               <p>By the conſtitution, <hi>Congreſs</hi> is endowed with the power of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring war.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe Lord Grenville had inſiſted, and Mr. Jay had approved, that the treaty ſhould be an offenſive and defenſive alliance; and, that we ſhould forthwith join Great Britain in her hoſtilities againſt France:—Could the Preſident and Senate thus <hi>negociate</hi> us into a war?</p>
               <p>By the conſtitution it is declared, "that no perſon holding any office, &amp;c. under the United States, ſhall, without the conſent of Congreſs, accept of any preſent, emolument, office or title, of any kind whatſoever, from any king, prince, or foreign ſtate."</p>
               <p>Suppoſe our envoy had been offered a preſent or a title by the Britiſh monarch—would the conſent of the treaty be tantamount to the conſent of Congreſs, for the purpoſe of approving and juſtifying his acceptance?</p>
               <p>By the conſtitution it is provided, that all bills for raiſing revenues, ſhall originate in the houſe of repreſentatives; and, that no money ſhall be drawn from the treaſury, but in conſequence of appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by law.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe Great Britain had ſtipulated, that as ſoon as the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners had fixed the ſum due to her ſubjects for old debts, the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſhould draw a warrant for the amount, and that the ſame ſhould be paid out of all public monies, in the treaſury of the United States, prior to the payment of any antecedent appropriation by law:— Would this be the proper ſubject for a treaty, or for an impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>

But fatigued and diſguſted with diſplaying, thus hypothetically the monſtrous conſequences, which will inevitably flow from <hi>the juriſdiction claimed on behalf of the Preſident and Senate, to bind the United States by any treaty, and in all caſes whatſoever;</hi> let us parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly examine <hi>the numerous and extravagant infractions</hi> of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, <hi>which the projected treaty actually commits.</hi> Recent as is the eſtabliſhment of the federal conſtitution, it is, indeed, to be lamented, that the poſſibility of violating it, is not a matter of floating and fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating popular opinion; but a matter ſuſceptible of fixed and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive proof. For, who does not recollect, that a bill touching the fundamental principle of the government (its repreſentative quality) <hi>after having paſſed both houſes of Congreſs, was declared by the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to be unconſtitutional; and, therefore, undeſerving of his official approbation and ſignature?</hi> Who can forget, that a law touching the eſſential properties of the judicial department of our government, <hi>after being ratified by every organ of legiſlative authority</hi> (the preſident, ſenate, and houſe of repreſentatives) <hi>was declared by chief juſtice Jay, and his aſſociate judges, to be unconſtitutional; and, therefore, incapable of being executed and enforced?</hi> With ſuch authoritative precedents (and there are many others that might be adduced from the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of individual ſtates) of the poſſibility of deviating from the rule and meaning of our conſtitution, are we to be damned for poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical hereſy, merely becauſe we doubt, or deny <hi>the infallibility of Mr. Jay's negociating talents?</hi> And muſt every man be <hi>accurſed</hi> (to uſe, for a moment, the intolerant language of the late ſecretary of the treaſury, in his character of <hi>the New York Camillus</hi>) who thinks, that <hi>the American envoy and the Britiſh miniſter were at leaſt as likely to miſtake, or miſconſtrue, the conſtitutional boundaries of the American government, as the preſident, ſen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <item>1. It is the right of every independent nation to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh and maintain a judicial authority, co-extenſive with its territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial poſſeſſions. The principle is indiſputable, and it is incidentally recognized by Lord Mansfield and other great lawyers, in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated controverſy between the king of Pruſſia and Great Britain, relative to the Sileſia Loan.</item>
                     <item>2. The conſtitutional tribunals of the United States were adequate to the adminiſtration of complete juſtice, in the very caſes for which the treaty provides a ſpecial tribunal.</item>

                     <item>4.

It is true, the treaty adds, that this "provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is to extend to ſuch loſſes only as have been occaſioned by <hi>lawful impediments;</hi>" but the <hi>extent</hi> of the diſcretion of the commiſſioners, in adjudging what conſtitutes a <hi>lawful</hi> impediment, is without limitation or controul; and the nature of the evidence, by which their minds are to be informed, is without rule or definition; ſince (in the language of the treaty) it may be "either according to the legal forms now reſpectively exiſting in the two countries, or in ſuch other manner as the ſaid commiſſioners ſhall ſee cauſe to require or allow." Thus, not only erecting a court un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to our conſtitution, but admitting a ſpecies of proof, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized by the legal forms of our country.</item>
                     <item>6. Let us appeal to Mr. Jay himſelf, upon the conſtitutionality of ſuch proceedings. By an act of Congreſs, the judges of the circuit courts were required to take, and report to the ſecretary at war, certain proofs in the caſe of invalids and penſioners. The judges refuſed (as we have already noticed) to execute the act, declaring it to be <hi>unconſtitutional,</hi> as well on account of the nature of the duty impoſed upon them, as on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the reviſionary power, which was veſted in the ſecretary at war. <hi>By the t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <item>7. But this is not the only infraction of the conſtitution, involved in the arrangement alluded to—<hi>the obligation of private contracts is transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from individuals to the public.</hi> The framers of the conſtitution, in declaring that "all debts contracted, and engagements entered into, before its adoption, ſhall be as valid againſt the United States under the conſtitution, as under the confederation," could hardly antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate, that they charged the treaſury of the union with the payment of all the outſtanding debts of the individual citizens of America! And when Congreſs was veſted with a power "to lay and collect taxes, <hi>to pay the debts,</hi> and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States;" it certainly was never contemplated, that the government of America became the inſurer of every Britiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="5 letters">

Whenever a treaty of peace and amity has <hi>heretofore</hi> been concluded with the Indians, it has been the conſtitutional practice of the Preſident, to call on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to regulate the commerce with them. Such calls were totally unneceſſary, if the ſame thing might as well and as lawfully be done <hi>by treaty;</hi> and if it could not be done by treaty in the caſe of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> neither could it be done by treaty in the caſe of a <hi>foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> For, both are expreſſed in the <hi>ſame terms,</hi> and included in the <hi>ſame member</hi> of the ſection. "Congreſs ſhall have power (ſays the conſtitution) to regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the ſeveral ſtates, and with the Indian tribes." What right is there by <hi>treaty</hi> to declare that <hi>no duty</hi> of entry ſhall ever be levied by either party <hi>on peltries, &amp;c.</hi> (and a ſimilar promiſe is made in caſes that more immediately affect Great Britain) ſince <hi>Congreſs</hi> has the ſole power to lay and collect taxes, <hi>duties,</hi> &amp;c. to pay the debts, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the common defence, and general welfare of the United States? If we may, <hi>negatively,</hi> ſay, <hi>by treaty,</hi> that certain duties ſhall not be laid, may we not <hi>affirmatively</hi> ſay, <hi>by treaty,</hi> that certain other du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties ſhall be laid? And then what becomes of that part of our conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which declares, "that all bills for raiſing revenue ſhall origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in the houſe of repreſentatives?" But let us imagine for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it is in the power of the Preſident and Senate to regulate our commerce with the Indian tribes; <hi>ought not the regulation to be made with the Indians themſelves?</hi> Why ſuffer Great Britain to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate and ſtipulate for Indians actually reſiding within the territory of the United States? Is ſuch a conceſſion conſiſtent with the dignity and independence of our government—with the peace and intereſt of the nation? Let Mr. Randolph's letter to Mr. Hammond, on the conduct of general Simcoe and major Campbell be referred to, as an anſwer to this queſtion. It is not, at preſent, within reach to be quoted; but its contents were too important to have already eſcaped the memory of any reflecting American.</p>

                  <hi>Remarks.</hi> To define crimes, and apportion puniſhments, is the peculiar province of the <hi>legiſlative authority</hi> of every free government: but it is obvious, from the foregoing recapitulation, that the <hi>executive authority</hi> has likewiſe encroached upon that province, by the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of its <hi>treaty-making</hi> power. Can a citizen be ſurrendered <hi>by treaty</hi> to all the pains and penalties of <hi>piracy?</hi> Then <hi>by treaty,</hi> he might be ſubjected to all the pains and penalties of <hi>treaſon.</hi> It is true, that the conſtitution reſerves to itſelf <hi>the excluſive right</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what ſhall conſtitute <hi>treaſon;</hi> but it is equally true, that it beſtows on Congreſs the <hi>excluſive right</hi> to define and puniſh <hi>piracy:</hi> and the invaſion of <hi>the right to deſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </hi> in one caſe, is as unconſtitutional as the invaſion of <hi>an actual definition</hi> in the other. But what legiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate authority can <hi>a treaty</hi> ſuggeſt, in order to juſtify the reſtraint upon that right of expatriation, which Congreſs itſelf has not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to reſtrain, while legiſlating on ſubjects of a ſimilar claſs? It is not intended to convey the ſlighteſt doubt of the power and pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>priety of controuling our citizens in their conduct towards <hi>foreign nations,</hi> while they are within the reach of <hi>domeſtic coercion:</hi> but to prohibit and American freeman from going whither he pleaſes, in queſt of fortune and happineſs—to reſtrict him from exerciſing, <hi>in a foreign country, and in a foreign ſervice,</hi> his genius, talents and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; to denounce him for ſeeking honour, emolument or inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by enliſting <hi>within the territory, and under the banners</hi> of another nation—to do ſuch things, is to condemn the principle of our own policy, by which we invite all the world to fill up the population of our country: To do ſuch things is, in fact, to proſtrate the boaſted rights of man. It is hardly worth a pauſe to aſk, What proportion of reſpect is due to the commiſſion of a Britiſh officer? and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of puniſhment the refuſal or neglect to pay it, may deſerve?</p>

               <p>By the treaty, "it is expreſsly agreed and declared that the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States will probibit and reſtrain the carrying any melaſſes, ſugar, coffee, cocoa, or co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Remarks.</hi> This is an extract, it is true, from the twelfth article of the treaty; but it equally ſerves to ſhow the probability of attempts to violate the conſtitution. Beſides, the advocates for the treaty are haſty and premature, when they deſire to throw the twelfth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle entirely out of conſideration: for, by that propoſition, <hi>though they ſhould ſave the treaty, they effectually deſtroy its author.</hi> They are haſty and premature for another reaſon: the twelfth article is to be <hi>ſuſpended for the declared purpoſe of negociating ſomething as a ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute;</hi> and, therefore we muſt conſider its principle, in order to aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:028527_0035_0FD934E4D09C7CB8"/>how far <hi>any modification</hi> of it could be rendered palatable. But, <hi>on conſtitutional ground,</hi> when it is declared, that <hi>no duty</hi> ſhall <hi>by law</hi> be laid on articles exported from any ſtate, is it not abſurd, or wicked to ſuppoſe, that <hi>by treaty</hi> the exportation of <hi>the articles themſelves</hi> can be prohibited? The obvious intention of <hi>the conſtitution</hi> is to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <hi>our export trade;</hi>—the immediate effect of <hi>the treaty</hi> is to obſtruct and annihilate it.</p>
               <p n="7">(7.) There are many other points in which <hi>a colliſion occurs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the conſtitution and the treaty,</hi> but to which the ſcope and nature of theſe ſtrictures will not admit a full attention.

If a part of the United States may be ceded—if a whole ſtate may be ceded, what becomes of the guarantee of a republican form of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to every ſtate? The propriety of preſenting this conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the public mind, will be allowed by thoſe who know, that, <hi>in the courſe of the ſenatorial debate, the</hi> right <hi>of</hi> ceding by treaty <hi>a</hi> whole <hi>ſtate, nay,</hi> any number <hi>of the ſtates, ſhort of a majority, was</hi> boldly aſſerted, <hi>and</hi> ſtrenouſly argued!!!</p>
               <p n="8">(8.) It may not be amiſs, likewiſe, to add, that our government has no more right to <hi>alienate powers that are given,</hi> than it has to <hi>uſurp powers that are not given.</hi> For inſtance, <hi>an act of Congreſs</hi> could not (and can a treaty?) ſurrender the right of ſequeſtering the property of a hoſtile nation—the right of giving commercial prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to a friendly nation—and the right of ſuſpending a ruinous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with any nation? Great clamours have been raiſed againſt <hi>the exerciſe</hi> of theſe rights; and, undoubtedly, they ſhould only be uſed <hi>in the laſt reſort;</hi> but they are rights <hi>recogniſed by the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and they are rights often eſſential to the duties of <hi>ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ſometimes neceſſary to the accompliſhment of <hi>reciprocal juſtice.</hi>

Having taken this <hi>review of the actual warfare between the conſtitution and Mr. Jay's diplomatic work,</hi> and of the deſtructive conſequences of the claim of <hi>the executive, to bind the United States, in all caſes whatſoever, by treaty;</hi> let us recur to the poſition with which the preſent feature was introduced, namely, <hi>the duty of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the conſtitution, ſuch as it was made and intended by the people,</hi> and we ſhall find, by a faithful compariſon of theory with practice, that <hi>the government of the United States may be transformed through the medium of the treaty-making power, from a republic to an oligarchy—from a free government of ſeveral departments,</hi> legiſlative, judicial and executive—<hi>to the ſimple oriſtocratical</hi> government of a Preſident and Senate.</p>

This fatal effect, however, of converting our government from the ſyſtem which the people <hi>love,</hi> to a ſyſtem which they <hi>abhor,</hi>—from what it was made in theory, to what it was never intended to be made by practice—can only proceed from <hi>error</hi> or <hi>corruption.</hi> It

The denunciations fulminated by <hi>the New-York Camillus,</hi> and his ſmall circle of coadjutors, harmleſsly expand themſelves in the violence of their exploſion: like the denunciations of <hi>the Tiara,</hi> they ſpring from <hi>an arrogant claim of infallibility;</hi> and like them too, will only excite <hi>the deriſion or the diſguſt of an enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened nation.</hi> Is it credible, that every citizen of the United States, from Georgia to New-Hampſhire, who reprobates Mr. Jay's treaty, muſt either be <hi>an enemy to our government,</hi> or <hi>a rancorous incendiary?</hi> Is it to be preſumed that no man can utter a ſentence of diſapproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſpecting <hi>the principles</hi> of the treaty, without feeling a ſentiment of animoſity, reſpecting <hi>the perſon</hi> of the negociator? Are we really ſuch ſlaves to faction;—ſo trammelled with party;—ſo inſenſible to virtue, truth and patriotiſm;—that every thought which we conceive, every expreſſion which we uſe, on this momentous occaſion, muſt be connected with the poſſible (but it is ardently hoped the diſtant) event <hi>of electing a ſucceſſor to the preſent chief magiſtrate of the union?</hi> Yet, ſuch are the baſe and ſordid motives, paſſionately and wantonly aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by <hi>Camillus</hi> and the ſcanty troop of advocates, who follow him <hi>in ſupporting the treaty, to the great hoſt of the American people, riſing</hi> (as it were) <hi>in maſs to condemn it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it could be thought a convenient, a reputable, or a neceſſary taſk, how ſucceſsfully might <hi>the argument of recrimination</hi> be employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!

               <p>But why ſhould we arbitrarily <hi>abuſe,</hi> inſtead of endeavouring ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally to <hi>convince</hi> each other?

               <p>Our government, therefore, being <hi>a government of departments,</hi> it is (as we have already obſerved) inconſiſtent with <hi>the duty of ſelf-preſervation;</hi> or, in other words, it muſt proceed from an error in <hi>conſtruction;</hi> that <hi>one</hi> department ſhall aſſume and exerciſe all, or any, of the powers, of all, or any, of the other departments.—"The departments or government (to adopt the elegant figure uſed by an excellent judge, in a late admirable charge to a Philadelphia jury) are planets that revolve, each in its appropriate orbit, round the conſtitution, as the ſun of our political ſyſtem." Thus, if the legiſlative, executive, or judicial departments ſhall encroach, one upon the orbit of the other, the deſtruction of the order, uſe, and beauty of the political ſyſtem, muſt as inevitably enſue, as the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the order, uſe, and beauty of the planetary ſyſtem would follow, from a ſubverſion of the eſſential principles of attraction, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion and gravity.</p>
               <p n="13">13. It was neceſſary, however, that the power of making treaties with foreign nations, ſhould be veſted in one of the departments of the government: but the power of making treaties is not, in its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, paramount to every other power; nor does the exerciſe of that power naturally demand an excluſive juriſdiction. A nation may car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on its <hi>external commerce</hi> without the aid of <hi>the treaty-making power;</hi> but it cannot manage its <hi>domeſtic concerns</hi> without the aid of the <hi>le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power:</hi> the legiſlative power is, conſequently, of ſuperior importance and rank to the treaty-making power. Again: <hi>The le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power exerciſed conformably to the conſtitution,</hi> muſt be direct, univerſal, and concluſive in its operation and force upon the people; but <hi>the treaty-making power</hi> is ſcarcely in any inſtance independent of legiſlative aid to effectuate its efforts, and to render its compacts obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory on the nation. A memorable occurrence in the Engliſh hiſtory will ſerve to illuſtrate both of theſe poſitions: It is the fate of <hi>the commercial part of the famous treaty of Utrecht,</hi> concluded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween France and England in the year 1712. "The peace (ſays Ruſſel in his Hiſtory of Modern Europe, vol. 4. p. 457) was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally diſliked by the people, and all impartial men reprobated the treaty of commerce with France, as ſoon as the terms were known. Exception was particularly taken againſt the 8th and 9th ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, importing "That Great Britain and France ſhould mutually
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:028527_0039_0FD934F0C2D065E0"/>enjoy all the privileges in trading with each other, which either granted to the moſt favoured nation; that all prohibitions ſhould be removed, and no higher duties impoſed on the French commodities, than on thoſe of any other people." The ruinous tendency of theſe articles was perceived by the whole trading part of the kingdom. It was accordingly urged, when a bill was brought into the houſe of commons for confirming them, that the trade with Portugal, the moſt beneficial of any, would be loſt, ſhould the duties on French and Portugueſe wines be made equal, &amp;c. &amp;c. Theſe and ſimilar arguments induced the more moderate tories to join the whigs, <hi>and the bill was rejected by a majority of nine votes.</hi> In relating the ſame tranſaction, Smollet's hiſtory of England, vol. 2. p. 242, 246, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſome paſſages too remarkable to be omitted on the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. "Againſt the 8th and 9th articles, (ſays the hiſtorian) the Portugueſe miniſter preſented a memorial, declaring, that ſhould the duties on French wines be lowered to the ſame level with thoſe that were laid on the wines of Portugal, his maſter would renew the prohibition of the woolen manufactures, and other products of Great Britain. Indeed, all the trading part of the nation exclaimed againſt the treaty of commerce, which ſeems to have been conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in a hurry, before the miniſters fully underſtood the nature of the ſubject. This precipitation was owing to the fears that their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours after peace would miſcarry, from the intrigues of the whig faction, and the obſtinate oppoſition of the confederates." "Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bill (continues the ſame writer, in a ſubſequent page) being brought into the houſe of commons, for rendering the treaty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce effectual, <hi>ſuch a number of petitions were delivered againſt it,</hi> and ſo many ſolid arguments advanced by the merchants, who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined on the ſubject, that even a great number of tory members were convinced of the bad conſequence it would produce to trade, and voted againſt the miniſter on this occaſion."</p>
               <p>Perhaps there cannot, in the annals of all the nations of the earth, be found two caſes more parallel than the one which is thus recorded in the Engliſh hiſtory, and the one which at preſent agitates the American nation.—

               <p>Let us aſk, then, by what rule of conſtruction a power <hi>primarily and ſpecifically</hi> given to one body, can be aſſumed and exerciſed by another, to which, <hi>in a ſubſequent clauſe,</hi> a mere <hi>general</hi> authority is given?</p>
               <p>Upon the common law principles of conſtruction, <hi>the ſpecific powers</hi> would clearly, in ſuch a caſe, be deemed a reſervation and exception out of <hi>the general grant.</hi> But e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

                  </gap> according to a rule furniſhed by the conſtitution itſelf, the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eſult will be produced. Thus, the twelfth ratified amendment declares, "that the powers not delegated to the United States by the conſtitution, are reſerved to the ſtates reſpectively, or to the people." Now, if the general power granted for the purpoſe of making treaties, can ſet at nought the juriſdiction ſpecifically given to Congreſs for the purpoſe of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laws may it not, with equal propriety and effect, overleap the boundary thus interpoſed between popular rights and conſtituted powers? In the one caſe, the reſervation is expreſsly declared—in the other, it is neceſſarily implied.</p>
               <p n="2">(2. But if the delegation of a <hi>general power</hi> does, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey a right to embrace, in the exerciſe of that power, every authority not in compatible with its objects, the conſequence will be, that <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs may enter into treaties as well as the preſident and ſenate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, Congreſs is veſted with a juriſdiction "to make all laws, which ſhall be neceſſary and proper for carrying into execution their
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:028527_0041_0FD934F8A7B79E28"/>own powers:" and what laws are, in that reſpect, neceſſary and proper, they muſt, from the nature of the thing, be the judge.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe, therefore, that Congreſs was deſirous of forming <hi>an alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, offenſive and defenſive, with France,</hi> but could not obtain the conſtitutional number of two-thirds of the ſenate for accompliſhing the meaſure <hi>by treaty,—and act of Congreſs, in order to regulate commerce with that nation,</hi> would afford as effectual a mode (according to the new doctrine) ſince the act, on the pretext of an equivalent for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial advantages, might <hi>legiſlate</hi> us into the coveted alliance. The temptation and facility of proceeding in this way is obvious;—the paſſing of a law requiring but a majority of the ſenate; whereas the ratification of a treaty requires the concurrence of two-thirds of the members of that body.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It is not, however, neceſſary to mingle and confuſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments of our government, contrary to the firſt principles of a free republic; nor to make <hi>a part</hi> of our political ſyſtem <hi>equal to the whole,</hi> contrary to the ſoundeſt axioms of demonſtrative philoſophy, in order to give a juſt, efficient and ſalutary effect to the treaty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making power of the preſident and ſenate. For although,</p>
               <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, the <hi>treaty-making</hi> power cannot bind the nation by <hi>a deciſion</hi> upon any of the ſubjects, which the conſtitution expreſsly devolves upon the <hi>legiſlative power:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet, in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, the treaty-making power may <hi>negociate conditionally,</hi> reſpecting the ſubjects that conſtitutionally belong to <hi>the deciſion of the legiſlative power;</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And, in the <hi>third</hi> place, <hi>every other ſubject,</hi> proper for the national compact of a republic, may be <hi>negociated and abſolutely concluded by the treaty-making power.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">(4.) That ſuch a diſtinction was intended by the framers of our preſent excellent conſtitution, the reaſons that have been glanced at, muſt, it is thought, ſufficiently prove to every ingenuous mind: But let one argument more be adduced.</p>
               <p>By the ninth article of the old confederation, it was declared, "That the United States, in Congreſs aſſembled, ſhall have <hi>the ſole and excluſive right and power of determining on peace and war.</hi>"</p>
               <p>By the exiſting conſtitution of the United States, it is provided, "That Congreſs ſhall have power <hi>to declare war,</hi> grant letters of marque and repriſal," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now, it is evident, that by omitting to depoſit <hi>with Congreſs</hi> the power of <hi>making peace,</hi> in addition to the power of <hi>declaring war,</hi> the framers of our preſent government, had in full view the diviſion of its department, and the correſponding diſtribution of its powers.</p>
               <p>Congreſs, <hi>under the confederation</hi> was a <hi>ſingle</hi> body, and therefore, neceſſarily poſſeſſed of all the little legiſlative, executive, and judicial authority, which <hi>the ſtates</hi> had been pleaſed to delegate <hi>to the union.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The government of the United States,</hi> on the contrary, is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound ſyſtem, of which the Congreſs is only <hi>the legiſlative department:</hi> and, therefore, the executive and judicial functions are elſewhere to be ſought for and exerciſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:028527_0042_0FD934FD33714020"/>
Hence it is, that although the power of <hi>declaring war is</hi> (as it ought to be) <hi>left with Congreſs,</hi> the power of <hi>making peace is</hi> (as it ought to be) <hi>transferred to the executive;</hi> being a natural appendage of the general power of <hi>making treaties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This deduction ſerves likewiſe to demonſtrate, that the framers of the conſtitution, did not intend to leave the powers that are <hi>ſpecifically</hi> given to Congreſs, at the mercy of the power that is <hi>generally</hi> given to the preſident and ſenate. By expreſſing a poſitive juriſdiction in favour of the former, it excludes a claim of juriſdiction in favour of the latter.</p>

On reviewing the various poſitions that have been taken in the courſe of theſe ſtrictures, a deſire is felt to exhibit the corrobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative opinions of men who have been juſtly valued by the public: It will be uſeful to the reader, as well as pleaſing to the writer, to indulge the diſpoſition in a few inſtances, and in a brief manner.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) It has been laid, that <hi>the power of regulating commerce belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Congreſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The report of Mr. Maſon (a member of the federal convention) on that ſubject, was delivered in the convention of virginia as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: "With reſpect to commerce and navigation, I will give you, to the beſt of my information, the hiſtory of that affair. This bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was diſcuſſed [in the convention] at Philadelphia for four months; during which time the ſubject of commerce and navigation was often under conſideration; and, I aſſert, that eight out of twelve, for more than three months, voted for requiring two-thirds of the members preſent in each houſe to paſs commercial and navigation laws. True it is, that afterwards it was carried by a majority as it ſtands. If I am right, there was a great majority for two-thirds of the ſtates in this buſineſs, till a compromiſe took place between the northern and ſouthern ſtates; the northern ſtates agreeing to the temporary importation of ſlaves; and the ſouthern ſtates conceding, in return, that navigation and commercial laws ſhould be on the footing in which they now ſtand."</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) It has been ſaid, that <hi>the treaty-making power could not cede a part of the union, nor ſurrender a citizen to be puniſhed as a pirate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The opinion of Mr. Randolph (a member of the federal conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and now ſecretary of ſtate) delivered in the ſame convention, contains the following paſſage: "I conceive, that neither the life,

                  <hi>Mr. Madiſon,</hi> alſo, juſtifying and recommending the adoption of the conſtitution to his fellow citizens, ſays, with reſpect to <hi>the treaty-making power—</hi>"I am perſuaded, that when this power comes to be thoroughly and candidly viewed, it will be found right and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Does it follow, becauſe this power is given to Congreſs, that it is abſolute and unlimited?—I do not conceive that power is given to the preſident and ſenate to diſmember the empire, or to alienate any great, eſſential right. I do not think the whole legiſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority have this power. The exerciſe of the power muſt be conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the object of the delegation."</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) It has been ſaid, <hi>the right of ſuſpending a commercial intercourſe with any nation, and the right of ſequeſtering an enemy's property, &amp;c.</hi> were rights <hi>eſſential to an independent government, and recogniſed by the law of nations.</hi>

SUCH. upon the whole, are <hi>"THE FEATURES OF MR. JAY's TREATY."</hi> It was not intended to protract this ſketch of then, to ſo great a length; and yet, more circumſtances are recollected, that might have been inſerted, than could, upon a fair reconſideration, be retrenched. If it ſhall, in any degree ſerve the purpoſes of truth, by leading, through the medium of a candid inveſtigation, <hi>to a fair, honourable, and patriotic deciſion,</hi> the deſign with which it was written will be completely accompliſhed, <hi>whether RATIFICATION or REJEC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION is the reſult.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, before the ſubject is cloſed, let the citizens of the union be warned from too credulous an indulgence of <hi>their prejudices</hi> and <hi>their fears.</hi> The diſcordant cry of party is loud; and the phantoms of war aſſail the imagination: yet, let us not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>deluded by ſtratagem, nor vanquiſhed by terror. The queſtion is not a queſtion between party and party, but between nation and nation:—it is not a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of war or peace, between military powers; but a queſtion of policy and intereſt between commercial rivals. The ſubject is too momentous, to be treated as the foot-ball of contending factions;— it appeals from the paſſions to the judgment; from the ſelfiſhneſs to the patriotiſm of every citizen!</p>
               <p>That <hi>the Britiſh treaty, or a Britiſh war, is a neceſſary alternative,</hi> will be more fully controverted, if the writer's preſent intention of delineating <hi>"FEATURES OF THE DEFENCE,"</hi> ſhall be carried into effect. But, in the mean time, let a few ſelf-evident propoſitions contribute to relieve the public mind, from the weight of that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>diſpoſition of Great Britain,</hi> manifeſted by the order of the 6th of November, 1793, by the ſpeech of Lord Dorcheſter to the Indians, and by the repeated invaſions made, under General Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coe's authority, upon our territory, <hi>is naturally hoſtile to the United States.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. Even if the United States could, by any means, ſoothe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert that diſpoſition into amity and peace, <hi>the projected treaty is too high a price to pay for ſuch a change.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. The refuſal to enter into the projected treaty with Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, is <hi>not a juſt cauſe of war;</hi> and if a <hi>pretence,</hi> only, is wanting, it may be found in the toaſts at our feſtivals, as well as in the acts of our government.</item>
                  <item>4. But the ratification of the treaty will aſſuredly give umbrage to <hi>another nation</hi>—to an ancient ally.</item>
                  <item>5. If war is inevitable <hi>either with Great Britain, or with France,</hi> it would be more politic for the ſtate, more congenial to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the people, to engage the former, than the latter, power.</item>
                  <item>6. In caſe of a war with Great Britain, we have aſſurance, <hi>that France will aid us with all the energy of her triumphant arms.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. In caſe of a war with France, we ought not to count upon <hi>the aſſections,</hi> and we cannot rely upon the power, of Great Britain, to befriend us.</item>

            <head>[FROM THE PHILADELPHIA GAZETTE.] View of the Commerce of the United States, as it ſtands at preſent, and as it is fixed by Mr. Jay's Treaty.</head>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Actual State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AMERICAN ſhips from Europe enjoy a protecting duty of 10 per cent on the amount of duties on goods, wares, and merchandiſes, imported into the United States in foreign bottoms from Europe, and of 30 to 50 per cent. on teas imported in foreign bottoms from Aſia or Europe, paid by foreign bottoms, more than is paid on ſuch goods imported in our own veſſels. Foreign bottoms pay alſo 44 cents a ton on every voyage, more than is paid by Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſhipping; all which had been allowed by the federal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to encourage American ſhip-builders, mariners, mechanics, merchants, and farmers.</p>

            </p>
            <p>By treaty, America cedes Great Britain, the right of laying duties on our ſhips in Europe, the Weſt Indies, and Aſia, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervail theſe, and engages not to encreaſe her duties on tonnage on this ſide, ſo as to check the exerciſe of this right: in conſequence Britiſh ſhips may be put, at the diſcretion of the Britiſh government, on exactly the ſame footing, as American ſhips in the carrying trade of Europe and Aſia.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Actual State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Americn ſhips, of any ſize, now go freely to all the Britiſh Weſt Indies, ſell their cargoes, and bring returns as it ſuits them.</p>

            <p>By treaty American ſhips are to be reduced to <hi>ſeventy tons,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be admitted in the Britiſh-Weſt Indies.</p>
