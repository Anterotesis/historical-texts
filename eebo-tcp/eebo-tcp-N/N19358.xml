            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the publication of <hi>Poſthumous Works,</hi> it has been uſual for the Editors or Publiſhers to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany them with a Prefatory Addreſs,—generally explaining the particular reaſons for offering them to the world, or relating their peculiar merits, and conſequently their claim to the patronage of the lovers of ſcience. In compliance with this general cuſtom we think it neceſſary merely to note, that having been frequently ſolicited to publiſh, in a ſeparate volume, a part of thoſe writings of Mrs. BLEECKER which had appeared in the <hi>New-York Magazine,</hi> we conceived a collection of all ſuch of her poems and eſſays as might with propriety come before th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Having ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted this idea to thoſe who appeared moſt ſtrenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the meaſure, we were pleaſed to find it met their hearty concurrence; and through the oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſition of her huſband and daughter, we are now happy in being able to preſent this volume to our fellow citizens.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:025208_0004_0FCC8E9FE858F6D8"/>We are indebted to a friend for the idea of adding a number of proſe and poetical eſſays, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe firſt appeared in the <hi>New-York Magazine,</hi> moſt of them under the ſignature of ELLA, and which are the production of Mrs. MARGARETTA V. FAU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GERES, the daughter of Mrs. BLEECKER. Our obligations to this lady are much increaſed by the addition of ſeveral Original Eſſays in verſe, which the reader will find interſperſed in that part of the collection which comprehends her writings.</p>
            <p>It is not our intention to recommend this volume by an elaborate diſplay of its particular merits or peculiar excellencies: the beſt recommendation we can give it, is an attentive peruſal: and when this is done, that the reader of taſte and elegance will join in aſſerting, that though it is not faultleſs, yet that its merits preponderate, and entitle it to the patronage of every true American, is the candid opinion of</p>

            <head>MEMOIRS OF Mrs. ANN ELIZA BLEECKER.</head>
            <p>MRS. ANN ELIZA BLEECKER was the youngeſt child of Mr. BRANDT SCHUYLER, of this city, (the place of her nativity;) ſhe was born in October, anno Domini 1752; and though in her early years ſhe never diſplayed any partiality for ſchool, yet ſhe was paſſionately fond of books, inſomuch that ſhe read with propriety any book that came to hand long before the time that children in common paſs their Spelling-Books. But though her poetical produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (which made their appearance very early) diſplayed a taſte far ſuperior to her years; yet, ſo great was her diffidence of
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:025208_0012_0FCCA28E37E26198"/>
her own abilities, that none but her moſt intimate acquaintance were ever indulged with a view of any of her performances, and <hi>then</hi> they were no ſooner peruſed than ſhe deſtroyed them.</p>
            <p>Hence it comes, that none of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions previous to the year 1769, are extant: in that year ſhe married JOHN J. BLEECKER, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>New-Rochelle</hi>; and being willing <hi>now</hi> to cheriſh her genius, after a ſhort reſidence in the capital, they retired to <hi>Poughkeepſie,</hi> where they ſtayed a year or two; and then taking a liking to the northern parts of this ſtate, they removed to <hi>Tomhanick,</hi> a beautiful ſolitary little village eighteen miles above <hi>Albany.</hi> Here Mr. BLEECKER built him an houſe on a little eminence, which commanded a pleaſing proſpect. On the <hi>eaſt</hi> ſide of it was an elegantly ſimple <hi>garden,</hi> where fruits and flowers, exotics as well as natives, flouriſhed with beauty; and a little beyond it the roaring river of <hi>Tomhanick</hi> daſhed
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:025208_0013_0FCCA290222009C8"/>
with rapidity its foaming waters among the broken rocks; toward the <hi>weſt,</hi> lay wide cultivated fields; in the <hi>rear,</hi> a young or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard, bounded by a thick foreſt; and in <hi>front,</hi> (after croſſing the main road) a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, through which wandered a dimpling ſtream, ſtretched itſelf to join a ridge of tall nodding pines, which roſe in awful grandeur on the ſhelving brow of a graſſy mountain. Through the openings of this wood you might deſcry little cottages ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered up and down the country, whoſe environs the hard hand of Induſtry had transformed into rich fields and blooming gardens, and literally cauſed the wilderneſs to bloſſom as the roſe—It is to this ſcene ſhe alludes where ſhe ſo beautifully ſays,
<q>
                  <l>Caſt your eyes beyond this meadow,</l>
                  <l>Painted by a hand Divine,</l>
                  <l>And obſerve the ample ſhadow</l>
                  <l>Of that ſolemn ridge of pine.</l>
               </q>
This was ſuch a retreat as ſhe had always deſired—the dark foreſt, the ruſhing river,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:025208_0014_0FCCA291992A8140"/>
and the green valley had more charms for her than the gay metropolis ſhe had left, and in which ſhe was ſo well calculated to ſhine: and ſhe was ſo much attached to rural pleaſures, that no birds (thoſe of prey excepted) were ever ſuffered to be ſhot near her habitation if ſhe could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it—indeed, they built their neſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moleſted in the very porch of the houſe.</p>
            <p>And the cultivation of flowers had like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a large ſhare of her attention, ſo much, that where <hi>Flora</hi> had been remiſs in deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſod, ſhe took upon herſelf that office, by gathering ſeeds from her own garden and ſtrewing them promiſcuouſly in the woods and fields, and along the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very borders of her favourite brook.</p>
            <p>'Till the memorable 1777, they lived in the moſt perfect tranquillity—fair proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects were opening on every ſide—Her mother, a widow, (an ornament to the ſex) lived with her—her half-ſiſter, Miſs TEN EYCK <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

companion—and her attentive huſband and prattling children cloſed the circle, and left her ſcarce another wiſh on this ſide of the grave—<hi>Then,</hi> indeed, the clamorous thunders of <hi>War</hi> frighted them from their peaceful dwelling, and the blaſting hand of <hi>Deſolation</hi> diſperſed them as a flock in the deſert.</p>
            <p>Mr. BLEECKER, hearing of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of the infatuated BURGOYNE, had left Mrs. BLEECKER with the children and ſervants, while he went to <hi>Albany</hi> to ſeek a place for them, (her mother and ſiſter having juſt quitted her.) But he had ſcarce been gone a day when, as ſhe ſat at breakfaſt, ſhe received intelligence that the enemy were within two miles of the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, burning and murdering all before them. Terrified beyond deſcription ſhe roſe from the table, and taking her ABELLA on her arm, and her other daughter (about four years old) by the hand, ſhe ſet off on foot, with a young mulatto girl, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:025208_0016_0FCCA294345EB530"/>
the houſe and furniture to the mercy of the approaching ſavages. The roads were crouded with carriages loaded with women and children, but none could afford her aſſiſtance—diſtreſs was depictured on every countenance, and tears of heartfelt anguiſh moiſtened every cheek. They paſſed on—no one ſpoke to another—and no ſound but the diſmal creaking of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened wheels and the trampling of horſes interrupted the mournful ſilence. After <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> tedious walk of four or five miles, ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſeat for the children upon one of the waggons, and ſhe walked on to <hi>Stony-Arabia,</hi> where ſhe expected to find many friends; but ſhe was deceived—no door was open to <hi>her,</hi> whoſe houſe by many of them had been made uſe of as a home— ſhe wandered from houſe to houſe, and at length obtained a place in the garret of a rich old acquaintance, where a couple of blankets, ſtretched upon ſome boards, were offered her as a bed; ſhe, however, ſat up
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:025208_0017_0FCCA295AEBC5718"/>
all night and wept, and the next morning Mr. BLEECKER coming from <hi>Albany,</hi> met with them and returned to that city, from whence they ſet off with ſeveral other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies by water. At twelve miles below <hi>Albany</hi> little ABELLA was taken ſo ill that they were obliged to go on ſhore, where ſhe died. The <hi>impreſſions</hi> this event made on Mrs. BLEECKER's mind were never effaced. The remembrance of every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that led to it—the return of the ſeaſon—the voice of an infant—or even the calm approach of a ſummer's evening, never failed to awaken all her ſorrows; and ſhe being naturally of a penſive turn of mind, <hi>too</hi> freely indulged them.</p>
            <p>From this they proceeded to <hi>Red-Hook,</hi> where ſhe met with her mother, who was declining very faſt, and died a little after her daughter's arrival. The capture of BURGOYNE ſoon after taking place, they again ſet off to viſit their little ſolitude; but, in their journey thither, ſhe had the
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:025208_0018_0FCCA297E2200DB0"/>
ſorrowful office of cloſing the eyes of her laſt remaining ſiſter.<note n="*" place="bottom">Her own ſiſter, Mrs. SWITS—her half-ſiſter, Mrs. DARBE, (then Miſs TEN EYCK,) is ſtill living.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The deſcription ſhe has given of theſe events, in a letter to a friend, may not be unacceptable.</p>

could then have beheld with leſs anguiſh the diſſolution of Nature than the laſt gaſp of my infant.

While I held the expiring ſaint in my arms, and ſaw her juſt verging into eternity—while I dropt tear after tear in ſolemn ſilence over her livid countenance, oh how ſincerely did I wiſh to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her from thoſe ſcenes of vanity, from which her admirable precepts had ſo much detached my affections! <hi>Oh my mother! cried I,</hi> you <hi>lately wept for my</hi> ABELLA, <hi>we now pay the ſame mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tribute to</hi> you! Oh Death! thou greateſt evil annexed to human nature, how doſt thou diſſolve the ſweet connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among men, and burſt away the ſilken bands of Friendſhip! I thought I had <hi>now</hi> deſcended the loweſt vale of
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:025208_0020_0FCCA29BA27A81F0"/>
mortal ſorrow, but the deception vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the bed-ſide of my expiring ſiſter. To enhance the diſtreſs, ſix tender in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants were clamouring round their inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible mother, the one half unconſcious of the occaſion of the general grief, and only lamenting becauſe the reſt did.</p>
                  <p>After her interment I returned hither, truly convinced how viſionary the eclat of <hi>this</hi> world is, and deſiring to paſs the remainder of my life in a tranquil enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bounties of heaven, neither elated to the extravagance of <hi>mirth,</hi> nor ſunk to the meanneſs of <hi>dejection.</hi>

            <p>From this period till the year 1781, they lived in tolerable tranquillity, when, in the beginning of Auguſt, as Mr. BLEECKER was aſſiſting in the harveſt, he, with two of his men, were made priſoners by a party
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:025208_0021_0FCCA29DD6DF9740"/>
from <hi>Canada,</hi> and taken off immediately. As it was late in the afternoon, Mrs. BLEECKER expected him with a degree of impatience, and began to be apprehenſive that ſomething uncommon had occurred: a ſervant was therefore diſpatched, who ſoon returned with the ſorrowful account, that he could not ſee any of them, and that the waggon and horſes were in the road tied to a tree.</p>
            <p>She was at no loſs to conjecture what was become of him, for a number of ſmall parties from <hi>Canada</hi> were known to be ſculking in the woods, for the ſole pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of carrying off the moſt active citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens. The neighbours therefore were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately alarmed, and the woods, as far as was practicable, were ſearched; but they could not diſcover a ſingle trace of the party. Mrs. BLEECKER, giving him up for loſt, ſet off for <hi>Albany</hi> directly, though it was then near night, and abandoned her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the moſt hopeleſs grief; but, by a
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:025208_0022_0FCCA29EC7BD4ED8"/>
wonderful train of events, Mr. BLEECKER was re-taken by a party from <hi>Bennington,</hi> after having paſſed the laſt habitation on this ſide of the <hi>Green-Mountains,</hi> and when his conductors for the <hi>firſt time</hi> had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themſelves as perfectly ſecure. He returned to her in ſix days, and the joy ſhe felt at finding him operating more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully than the grief ſhe experienced at his loſs, a fit of ſickneſs enſued, which nearly proved fatal. They again returned to <hi>Tomhanick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though Mrs. BLEECKER was witneſs to many ſcenes of diſtreſs during the late war, in many of which ſhe was the principal ſufferer; yet, the idea of a <hi>far diſtant</hi> peace, which ſhould again reſtore her to her friends, gilt the ſolitary ſhades which encompaſſed her, and bore her up under frequent and poignant griefs.</p>
            <p>In the year 1783, (the ſpring after the peace,) ſhe re-viſited <hi>New-York,</hi> in hopes of ſeeing her old acquaintance and friends;
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:025208_0023_0FCCA2A02C893AD8"/>
but her hopes were far from being realiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—ſome were dead; others had left the continent; and the few who remained were in different ſtates: She ſaw her half-ſiſter, Miſs TEN EYCK, but once, and then but for a few minutes, as one party was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking for <hi>New-York</hi> juſt as the other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Albany.</hi> Her principal correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and much-loved relatives, the Miſs V** W***'s, were in <hi>Jerſey</hi>; and as the Britiſh were ſtill here, ſhe could not (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the greateſt difficulty) viſit them. But the ruinous condition of her native city gave ſuch a ſhock to her ſpirits as the unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed efforts of her reaſon and fortitude were not able to ward off. The places which ſhe once knew as the ſcenes of feſtivity, were now ſunk into duſt—the place that once knew them knowing them no more; or if by hard ſearching ſhe at laſt deſcried them, they only met her eye as monuments of her paſt pleaſures—dreary piles, mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering faſt beneath the relentleſs hand of
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:025208_0024_0FCCA2A2E808A070"/>
               <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>War.</hi> Her ſenſibility was too keen for her peace—She had ſtruggled on through the war, and had ſuffered <hi>Hope</hi> to beguile the hours devoted to diſtreſs: but <hi>now</hi> the ſcene was changed—the illuſion vaniſhed, and ſhe concluded <hi>now</hi> ſhe ſhould ſee no more good upon earth. She return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again to her cottage, where ſhe found her health very rapidly decline; and on the 23d of the following November, about noon-day, (after two days confinement to her bed) her calm ſpirit took its flight from its ſhattered habitation, without a ſtruggle or a groan. She retained her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes till within a few minutes of her death; and the laſt words ſhe uttered to her weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing huſband and family, were aſſurances of the pleaſing proſpect <hi>Immortality</hi> offered her.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to ſay her loſs was ſeverely felt—it may be naturally ſuppoſed. The benevolence of her diſpoſition had extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf to all claſſes of people; and in
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:025208_0025_0FCCA2A3EDD886C8"/>
the village where ſhe dwelt, there were ſeveral families who might be called her dependants. To the aged and infirm ſhe was a phyſician and a friend—to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan ſhe was a mother—and a ſoother of the widow's woes; all loved—all honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her: and when they followed her to the grave, they weeping ſaid, (though differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expreſſed, ſtill meaning the ſame,) "<hi>We have loſt</hi> HER <hi>whoſe equal we ſhall never ſee again!</hi>"</p>
            <p>It is to be regretted that the writings which we now have are but a ſmall part of what ſhe compoſed: ſhe was frequently very lively, and would then give way to the flights of her fertile fancy, and write ſongs, ſatires, and burleſque: but, as draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cord too tight will make it break, thus ſhe would no ſooner ceaſe to be <hi>merry,</hi> than the heavieſt <hi>dejection</hi> would ſucceed, and then all the pieces which were not as melancholy as herſelf, ſhe deſtroyed. As ſhe ſeldom kept copies of her poetical epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
<pb n="xvi" facs="unknown:025208_0026_0FCCA2A5ED56F2E8"/>
the moſt of <hi>them</hi> are loſt; one in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, written ſome little time before ſhe fled from <hi>Tomhanick,</hi> in 1777, and directed to General BURGOYNE, was left in her bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reau; the bureau was broken open and its contents plundered by his men; but whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the letter ever reached him or not, is unknown. In the winters of 1779 and 1780, ſhe amuſed herſelf and friends by writing what ſhe called the <hi>Albany Gazette,</hi> which was ſent by every opportunity to <hi>Fiſhkill,</hi> where ſeveral of her relations lived. This lively and ingenious performance was much admired, and being handed about from one company to another, is entirely loſt. Several political and ſatirical pieces ſhared a ſimilar fate.</p>
            <p>Some of thoſe, however, which are left, are here preſented to the public. The poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ſentiments diſplayed in ſeveral of them will, it is probable, recommend them to the notice and favour of the Patriot, and the reſt may pleaſe the lovers of artleſs ſtyle.
<pb n="xvii" facs="unknown:025208_0027_0FCCA2A75BB260B8"/>
Many of them are faulty, but their merits are more numerous than their <hi>defects,</hi> and <hi>theſe</hi> will be eaſily pardoned and forgotten by all who knew her; for <hi>Detraction</hi> will not riſe up againſt <hi>her,</hi> after death, whoſe virtues, when alive, endeared her to ſo many admiring <hi>friends,</hi> and whoſe <hi>enemies</hi> (and <hi>Envy</hi> created her ſome) could not ſpeak evil of her.</p>
            <p>As moſt of theſe pieces were intended for the amuſement of herſelf and particular friends, and not for the public eye, they appear as they flowed extempore from her pen. Frequently ſhe wrote while with company, at the deſire of ſome one preſent, without premeditation, and at the ſame time bearing a part in the converſation.</p>
            <p>Mrs. BLEECKER poſſeſſed a conſiderable ſhare of beauty; her countenance was ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated, and expreſſive of her benevolent, feeling mind; her perſon, rather tall, was graceful and elegant; her eaſy, unaffected deportment and engaging manners pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured

            </opener>
            <p>HOWEVER fond of novels and romances you may be, the unfortunate adventures of one of my neighbours, who died yeſterday, will make you deſpiſe that fiction, in which, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſubject to be fabulous, we can never be ſo truly intereſted. While this lady was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring, Mrs. C— V—, her near kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman, related to me her unhappy hiſtory, in which I ſhall now take the liberty of intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you benevolent and feeling heart.</p>
            <p>MARIA KITTLE was the only iſſue of her parents, who cultivated a large farm on the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:025208_0031_0FCCA2AB69C874F8"/>
banks of the <hi>Hudſon,</hi> eighteen miles above <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bany.</hi> They were perſons of good natural abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, improved by ſome learning; yet, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of a deficiency in their education, they ſtudied nothing ſo much as to render their little daughter truly accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>MARIA was born in the year 1721. Her promiſing infancy preſaged a maturity of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies; every amiable quality dawned through her liſping prattle; every perſonal grace at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her attitudes and played over her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. As ſhe advanced through the playful ſtage of childhood, ſhe became more eminent than a Penelope for her induſtry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet, ſoon as the ſun declined, ſhe always retired with her books until the time of repoſe, by which means ſhe ſoon informed her opening mind with the principles of every uſeful ſcience. She was beloved by all her female companions, who, though they eaſily diſcovered her ſuperior ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of manners, inſtead of envying, were excited to imitate her. As ſhe always made one in their little parties of pleaſure on feſtival days, it is no wonder that ſhe ſoon became the reigning goddeſs among the ſwains. She was importuned to admit the addreſſes of numbers,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:025208_0032_0FCCA2ACE8D71BD0"/>
whom ſhe politely diſcarded, and withdrew herſelf awhile from public obſervation. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the fame of her charms attracted ſeveral gentlemen of family from <hi>Albany,</hi> who intruded on her retirement, ſoliciting her hand. But this happineſs was reſerved for a near relation of her's, one Mr. KITTLE, whoſe merits had made an impreſſion on her heart. He, although not handſome, was poſſeſſed of a moſt engaging addreſs; while his learning and moral virtues more particularly recommended him to her eſteem. Their parents ſoon diſcovered their reciprocal paſſion, and highly approving of it, haſtened their marriage, which was celebrated under the moſt happy auſpices.</p>
            <p>MARIA was fifteen when married. They removed to his farm, on which he had built a ſmall neat houſe, ſurrounded by tall cedars, which gave it a contemplative air. It was ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated on an eminence, with a green incloſure in the front, graced by a well cultivated gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den on one ſide, and on the other by a clear ſtream, which, ruſhing over a bed of white pebble, gave them a high poliſh, that caſt a ſoft gleam through the water.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:025208_0033_0FCCA2AF30C37988"/>Here they reſided in the tranquil enjoyment of that happineſs which ſo much merit and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence deferred: the indigent, the ſorrowful, the unfortunate were always ſure of conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when they entered thoſe peaceful doors. They were almoſt adored by their neighbours, and even the wild ſavages themſelves, who often reſorted thither for refreſhments when hunting, expreſſed the greateſt regard for them, and admiration of their virtues.</p>
            <p>In little more than a year they were bleſſed with a daughter, the lovelier reſemblance of her lovely mother: as ſhe grew up, her graces increaſing, promiſed a bloom and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equal to her's; the Indians, in particular, were extremely fond of the ſmiling ANNA; whenever they found a young fawn, or caught a brood of wood-ducks, or ſurpriſed the young beaver in their daily excurſions through the foreſts, they preſented them with pleaſure to her; they brought her the earlieſt ſtrawberries, the ſcarlet plumb, and other delicate wild fruits in painted baſkets.</p>
            <p>How did the fond parents hearts delight to ſee their beloved one ſo univerſally careſſed! When they ſauntered over the vernal fields
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025208_0034_0FCCA2B0AAA8A780"/>
with the little prattler wantoning before them collecting flowers and purſuing the velvet elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive butterfly, MARIA's cheek ſuffuſing with rapture, "Oh my dear," ſhe would ſay,
<q>we are happier than human beings can expect to be; how trivial are the evils annexed to our ſituation! may God avert that our hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be limited to this life!</q>
            </p>
            <p>Eleven years now elapſed before Mrs. KIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLE diſcovered any ſigns of pregnancy: her ſpouſe ſilently wiſhed for a ſon, and his deſires were at length gratified; ſhe was delivered of a charming boy, who was named, after him, WILLIAM.</p>
            <p>A French and Indian war had commenced ſometime before; but about eight months after her delivery, the ſavages began to commit the moſt horrid depredations on the Engliſh frontiers. Mr. KITTLE, alarmed at the danger of his brothers, who dwelt near <hi>Fort-Edward,</hi> (the eldeſt being juſt married to a very agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able young woman) invited them to reſide with him during the war.</p>
            <p>They were ſcarce arrived when the enemy made further incurſions in the country, burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the villages and ſcalping the inhabitants,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:025208_0035_0FCCA2B25623BD68"/>
neither reſpecting age or ſex. This terribly alarmed Mrs. KITTLE; ſhe began to prepare for flight, and the next evening after receiving this intelligence, as ſhe and Mr. KITTLE were buſily employed in packing up china and other things, they were accoſted by ſeveral Indians, whoſe wigwams were contiguous to the village of <hi>Schochticook,</hi> and who always ſeemed well affected to the Engliſh. An elderly ſavage undertook to be prolocutor, and deſired the family to compoſe themſelves, aſſuring them they ſhould be cautioned againſt any approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing danger. To inforce his argument, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented MARIA with a belt interwoven with ſilk and beads, ſaying,
<q>There, receive my token of friendſhip: we go to dig up the hatchet, to ſink it in the heads of your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; we ſhall guard this wood with a wall of fire—you ſhall be ſafe.</q>
A warm plow of hope deepened in MARIA's cheek at this— Then ordering wine to be brought to the friendly ſavages, with a ſmile of diffidence, "I am afraid," ſaid ſhe,
<q>neceſſity may oblige you to abandon us, or neglect of your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe may deprive us of your protection.</q>— "Neglect of my promiſe!" retorted he with
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:025208_0036_0FCCA2B3AC9AF9D0"/>
ſome acrimony:
<q>No, MARIA, I am a true man; I ſhoot the arrow up to the Great Captain every new moon: depend upon it, I will trample down the briars round your dwelling, that you do not hurt your feet.</q>
MARIA now retired, bowing a grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, and leaving the ſavages to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge their feſtivity, who paſſed the night in the moſt vociferous mirth.</p>
            <p>Mrs. KITTLE, with a ſort of exultation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated the ſubject of their conference to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, who had abſented himſelf on their firſt appearance, having formed ſome ſuſpicion of the ſincerity of their friendſhip, and not being willing to be duped by their diſſimulation. "And now," added MARIA ſmiling,
<q>our fears may again ſubſide: Oh my dear! my happineſs is trebled into rapture, by ſeeing you and my ſweet babes out of danger.</q>
He only ſighed, and reaching his arm round her poliſhed neck, preſſed her to his boſom. After a ſhort pauſe, "My love," ſaid he,
<q>be not too confident of their fidelity; you ſurely know what a ſmall dependence is to be placed on their promiſes: however, to appear ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious might be ſuddenly fatal to us; we
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025208_0037_0FCCA2B592BC3808"/>
will therefore ſuſpend our journey to <hi>Albany</hi> for a few days.</q>
Though MARIA's ſoul ſaddened at the conviction of this truth; though her fears again urged her to propoſe immediate flight, yet ſhe acquieſced; and having ſupped with the family, this tender pair ſunk aſleep on the boſom of reſt.</p>
            <p>Early the next morning Mr. KITTLE aroſe, firſt impreſſing a kiſs on MARIA's ſoft cheek, as ſhe ſlumbered with her infant in her arms. He then awaked his brother, reminding him that he had propoſed a hunting match the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding evening. "It is true," replied PETER,
<q>but ſince hoſtilities have commenced ſo near us as the Indians inform, I think it rather imprudent to quit the family.</q>—<q>Come, come,</q>
replied the other,
<q>do not let us intimidate the neighbours by cloiſtering our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up with women and children.</q>—<q>I reject the thought,</q>
rejoined PETER,
<q>of being afraid.</q>
Then having dreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, while his brother charged their pieces, they left the houſe, and traverſed the pathleſs graſs for many hours without perceiving any thing but ſmall birds, who filled the fragrant air with melody, "PETER," ſaid Mr. KIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLE,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025208_0038_0FCC8E99E5CBEB28"/>
caſting his eyes around the lovely land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape,
<q>what a profuſion of ſweets does Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture exhale to pleaſe her intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures! I feel my heart expand with love and gratitude to heaven every moment, nor can I ever be grateful enough. I have health and competence, a lovely fond wife whoſe ſmile would calm the rudeſt ſtorm of paſſion, and two infants bloſſoming into perfection; all my ſocial ties are yet unbroken—PETER, I anticipate my heaven—But why, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do you turn pale? what dreadful idea ſtiffens your features with amazement? what in God's name ails you, PETER? are you unwell? ſit down under this tree awhile.</q>
—To theſe interrogatories PETER replied,
<q>Excuſe my weakneſs, I am not unwell, but an unuſual horror chilled my blood; I felt as if the damps of death preſt already round my ſoul; but the vapour is gone off again, I feel quite better.</q>
Mr. KITTLE cheered his brother, attributing his emotion to fear; who, by this time, having re-aſſumed his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, entered into diſcourſe with cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs, refuſing to return home without having killed any thing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:025208_0039_0FCC8E9B62BED620"/>Then riſing, they proceeded through lofty groves of pine, and open fields that ſeemed to bend under the heavy hand of Ceres. At laſt, diſappointment and fatigue prevailed on them to return home<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they had gone farther than they apprehended; but paſſing along the bank of the river within a few miles of Mr. KIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TLE's, they eſpied a fat doe walking ſecurely on the beach, which PETER ſoftly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, levelled his piece with ſo good an aim that the animal dropped inſtantly at the exploſion. This ſeeming ſucceſs was, however, the origin of their calamities; for immediately after, two ſavages appeared, directed in their courſe by the firing. Setting up a loud yell, they ran up to the brothers and diſcharged their fire-arms. Mr. KITTLE ſtarted back, but PETER receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a brace of balls in his boſom. He recoiled a few ſteps back, and then ſunk down incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed by thoſe deadly horrors of which in the morning he had a preſentiment. Mr. KITTLE ſtood awhile aghaſt, like a perſon juſt waked from a frightful dream; but on ſeeing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian advancing to tear the ſcalp from his dying brother, he ſuddenly recollected himſelf, and ſhot a bullet through his head: then grappling
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025208_0040_0FCC8E9D48CC2AB0"/>
with the other, who was loading again, he wreſted his firelock from him, and felled him to the ground with the but-end of it. This was no time for reflection or unavailing laments; the danger was eminent: ſo leaving the ſavages for dead, with a mournful ſilence Mr. KITTLE haſtened to throw the deer from off his horſe, and laid his bleeding brother acroſs him.</p>
            <p>When our ſouls are gloomy, they ſeem to caſt a ſhade over the objects that ſurround us, and make nature correſpondent to our feelings: ſo Mr. KITTLE thought the night fell with a deeper gloom than uſual. The ſoft notes of evening birds ſeemed to be the reſponſes of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage yells. The echo of his tread, which he never before regarded, now rung diſmally hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in his ears. Even the ruſtling of the winds through the leaves ſeemed attended with a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity that chilled him with cold tremors. As he proceeded with his mournful charge, his feelings were alarmed for his dear MARIA; he dreaded the agitation and diſtreſs this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture would throw her in: but it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

ſhe ſprung with a joyful impatience to the door, and was met by her partner pale and bloody, who endeavoured to prevent too ſudden a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of this calamity. But at the firſt glance ſhe comprehended the whole affair, and retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few ſteps, with the moſt exquiſite agony in her countenance, "Oh Mr. KITTLE!" ſhe cried, claſping her hands together,
<q>it is all over—we are betrayed—your brother is killed!</q>
—"Too true, oh, too fatally true!" replied he, falling on his knees beſide her as ſhe ſunk down,
<q>my angel! the very ſavages that ſolemnly engaged to protect us have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived him of life; but I am yet alive, my MARIA, be comforted—I will inſtantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure carriages, and before morning you and your innocents ſhall be beyond the reach of their malevolence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>By this time the family had crouded about them, and with grievous wailings were inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the particulars of this ſad adventure. Mr. KIITLE having related every circumſtance with brevity, ordered the corpſe to be laid in a remote chamber, deſiring at the ſame time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

led the diſconſolate fair to her chamber, where, being ſeated, ſhe ſighing demanded where he intended to go at that time of night. "Only," ſaid he,
<q>to the village of <hi>Schochticook</hi> to hire a couple of waggons; I ſhall return in an hour I hope, with a proper guard to ſecure our retreat from this hoſtile place.</q>
MARIA was ſilent; at length ſhe burſt into a flood of tears, which his endearments only augmented. Then expoſtulating with him,
<q>Is it not enough,</q>
cried ſhe,
<q>that you have eſcaped one danger, but muſt you be ſo very, eager to encounter others? beſides, you are ſpent with ſorrow and fatigue—let one of your brothers perform this ſilent expedition.</q>— "It is impoſſible," replied the tender huſband;
<q>how can I dare to propoſe a danger to them from which I would ſhrink myſelf? their lives are equally precious with mine: but God may diſappoint our fears, my love!</q>
He would have continued, but his ſpouſe, riſing from her ſeat, interrupted him—
<q>At leaſt, my dear, before you leave us give your lovely babes a farewell embrace, that if fate ſhould —ſhould ſeparate us, <hi>that</hi> yet ſhall ſweeten our hours of abſence.</q>
Here ſhe found
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025208_0043_0FCCA2BAB06B7A30"/>
herſelf claſped in her conſort's arms, who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
<q>My MARIA! I love you paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, and if the leaſt ſhadow of danger did appear to attend this night's travel, for your ſake, for my bleſſed children's ſake I would decline it: but I have left the Indians lifeleſs, who no doubt attacked us from ſome private pique; nor will they be diſcovered until morning.</q>—"Well then," MARIA an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
<q>I no longer oppoſe you; forgive my fears.</q>
Meanwhile, as ſhe ſtept to the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle for her ſuckling, the fair ANNA, who was liſtening at the door anxious to hear her parents ſentiments on this occaſion, quitted her ſtation and flew to them ſwift as light; dropping on her knees before her father, and looked up in his face with the moſt attractive graces and the perſuaſive eloquence of ſimplicity. Her neck and features were elegantly turned, her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion fairer than the tuberoſe, and contraſted by the moſt ſhining ringlets of dark hair. Her eyes, whoſe brilliancy was ſoftened through the medium of tears, for a while dwelt tenderly on his countenance. At length, with a voi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

to you, mamma will die of grief, and what will become of poor ANNA and BILLY? who will care for me? who will teach me when my papa, my mamma's papa is gone?</q>
"—"My ſweet child," replied he, embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her and holding her to his boſom,
<q>there is no danger; I ſhall return in an hour, and before to-morrow you ſhall be ſafe on the plains of <hi>Albany,</hi> and my heart ſhall exult over the happineſs of my family.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mrs. KITTLE now approached with her playful infant in her arms; but its winning ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions extorted nothing but groans from her pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed boſom, which was more ſtormy than On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tario-Lake, when agitated by fierce winds. Mr. KITTLE perciving this uncommon emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gently took the child from her, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly kiſſed it, while new ſmiles dimpled its lovely aſpect. "Oh!" ſaid he to himſelf,
<q>this gloom that darkens MARIA's ſoul is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural!—it ſeems dreadfully portenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous!—Shall I yet ſtay?</q>
But here a ſervant informing him that his horſe was ready, he bluſhed at his want of fortitude; and having <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:025208_0045_0FCCA2BD6A619818"/>MARIA then walked ſadly back again, and having aſſembled the family in a little hall, they cloſed and barred the doors. Mrs. CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MELIA KITTLE, MARIA's ſiſter-in-law, was far advanced in her pregnancy, which increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her huſband's uneaſineſs for her; and they were debating in what manner to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date her at <hi>Albany,</hi> when the trampling of feet about the houſe, and a yell of complicated voices, announced the Indians arrival. Struck with horror and conſternation, the little family crouded together in the center of the hall, while the ſervants at this alarm, being in a kitchen diſtant from the houſe, ſaved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by a precipitate flight. The little BIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY, frightened at ſuch dreadful ſounds, clung faſt to his mother's throbbing breaſt, while ANNA, in a ſilent agony of amazement, claſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her trembling knees. The echo of their yells yet rung in long vibrations through the foreſt, when, with a thundering peal of ſtrokes at the door, they demanded entrance. Diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and deſpair fat upon every face. MARIA and her companions gazed wildly at each oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> till, upon repeated menaces and efforts to bre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025208_0046_0FCCA2BFB52C0B98"/>
for loſt, leiſurely advanced to the door. CO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MELIA ſeeing this, uttered a great ſhriek, and cried out,
<q>O God! what are your doing, my raſh, raſh, unfortunate huſband! you will be ſacrificed!</q>
Then falling on her knees, ſhe caught hold of his hand and ſobbed out,
<q>O pity me! have mercy on yourſelf, on me, on my child!</q>—"Alas! my love," ſaid he, half turning with a look of diſtraction,
<q>what can we do? let us be reſigned to the will of God.</q>
So ſaying he unbarred the door, and that inſtant received a fatal bullet in his boſom, and fell backward writhing in agonies of death; the reſt recoiled at this horrible ſpectacle, and huddled in a corner, ſending forth the moſt piercing cries: in the interim the ſavages ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in with great ſhouts, proceeded to mangle the corpſe, and having made an inciſion round his head with a crooked knife, they tugged off his bloody ſcalp with barbarous triumph. While this was perpetrating, an Indian, hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deouſly painted, ſtrode ſerociouſly up to COME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIA, (who ſunk away at the ſight, and fainted o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a chair) and cleft her white forehead deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with his tomahack. Her fine azure eyes juſt opened, and then ſuddenly cloſing for ever,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:025208_0047_0FCCA2C12C426220"/>
ſhe tumbled lifeleſs at his feet. His ſangui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſoul was not yet ſatisfied with blood; he deformed her lovely body with deep gaſhes; and, tearing her unborn babe away, daſhed it to pieces againſt the ſtone wall; with many additional circumſtances of infer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>al cruelty.</p>
            <p>During this horrid carnage, the dead were ſtripped, and dragged from the houſe, when one of the helliſh band advanced to MARIA, who circling her babes with her white arms, was ſending hopeleſs petitions to heaven, and bemoaning their cruelly loſt ſituation: as he approached, expecting the fatal ſtroke, ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to guard her children, and with ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating looks, implored for mercy. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage attempted not to ſtrike; but the aſtoniſhed ANNA ſheltered herſelf behind her mamma, while her blooming ſuckling quitting her breaſt, gazed with a pleaſing wonder on the painted ſtranger.—MARIA ſoon recognized her old friend that preſented her with the belt, through the loads of ſhells and feathers that diſguiſed him. This was no time, however, to irritate him, by reminding him of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; yet, gueſſing her thoughts, he antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated her remonſtrance. "MARIA," ſaid he,
<q>be not afraid, I have promiſed to protect you;
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:025208_0048_0FCCA2C2A8A07788"/>
you ſhall live and dance with us around the fire at <hi>Canada</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but you have one ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance, which, if not remove, will much impede your progreſs thither.</q>
So ſaying he ſeized her laughing babe by the wriſts, and forcibly endeavoured to draw him from her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>s. At this, terrified beyond conception, ſhe exclaimed,
<q>O God! leave me, leave me my child! he ſhall not go, though a legion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſhould try to ſeparate us!</q>
Holding him ſtill faſt, while the Indian applied his ſtrength to tear him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, gnaſhing his teeth at her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; "Help! God of heaven!" ſcreamed ſhe,
<q>help! have pity, have mercy on this infant! O God! O Chriſt! can you bear to ſee this? O mercy! mercy! mercy! let a little ſpark of compaſſion ſave this inoffend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, this lovely angel!</q>
By this time the breathleſs babe dropt its head on its boſom; the writs were nigh pinched off, and ſeeing him juſt expiring, with a dreadful ſhriek ſhe reſigned him to the mercileſs hands of the ſavage, who inſtantly daſhed his little forehead againſt the ſtones, and caſting his bleeding body at ſome diſtance from the houſe, left him to make his exit in feeble and unheard groans.—Then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025208_0049_0FCCA2C52B064070"/>
in the unutterable anguiſh of her ſoul, ſhe fell proſtrate, and rending away her hair, ſhe r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ared out her ſorrows with a voice louder than natural, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>endered awfully hollow by too great an exertion. "O barbarians!" ſhe exclaimed,
<q>ſurpaſſing devils in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! ſo may a tenfold night of miſery en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrap your black ſouls, as you have deprived the babe of my boſom, the comfort of my cares, my bleſſed cherub, of light and life— O hell! are not thy flames impatient to cleave the center and engulph <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Then ruſhing to her dead infant with redoubled cries, and clapping her hands, ſhe laid herſelf over his mangled body; again ſoftened in tears and moans, ſhe wiped the blood from his ghaſtly countenance, and preſt him to her heaving boſom, alternately careſſing him and her trembling ANNA, who, clinging to her with bitter wailings, and kiſſing her hands and face; entreated her to implore the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages for mercy. "Do, my angel mamma," ſhe urged,
<q>do beg them yet to pity—beg them yet to ſave you for my poor, poor papa's
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025208_0050_0FCCA2C66D816230"/>
ſake!—Alas! if we are all killed, his heart will break!—Oh! they can't be rocks and ſtones!—Don't cry mamma, they will ſpare us!</q>—Thus the little orator endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to conſole her afflicted mother; but their melancholy endearments were ſoon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the relentleſs ſavages, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plundered the houſe of every valuable thing that was portable, returned to MARIA, and rudely catching her arm, commanded her to follow them but repulſing them with the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of deſpair, "Leave me, leave me," ſhe ſaid.
<q>I cannot go—I never will quit my murdered child! Too cruel in your mercies, you have given me life only to prolong my miſeries!</q>—Meanwhile the lovely ANNA, terrified at the hoſtile appearance of the enemy, left her mamma ſtruggling to diſengage her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the Indians, and fled p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Again calling to her ANNA, ſhe received no anſwer, which being a preſumption of her death, the Indians obliged MARIA and her brother HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY to quit the houſe, which they effected with ſome difficulty, the glowing beams falling a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round them and thick volumes of ſmoke ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcuring their paſſage.

He replied only in ſighs and groans; he ſcarcely heard her; horror had froze up the avenues of his ſoul; and all amazed and tremblings, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed his leaders like a perſon in a troubleſome dream.</p>
            <p>The diſtant flames now caſt a fainter light, and the northern breeze bent the columns of ſmoke over the ſouth horizon.

ſunk helpleſs at the foot of a tree, while the ſavages (who were ſix in number) kindled a fire, and prepared their meal, (in a calabaſh) which conſiſted only of ſome parched maize pulverized and enriched with the fat of bears fleſh. Obſerving MARIA had fallen aſleep, they offered not to diſturb her, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited HENRY KITTLE to partake of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.

            <p>I am ſorry, dear SUSAN, to quit MARIA in this intereſting part of her hiſtory; but order requires that we ſhould now return to her ſpouſe, whom we left on his way through the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

As he approached his late happy dwelling, his boſom dilated with the pleaſing hope of ſoon extricating his beloved family from danger; he chid the ſlowneſs of the carriages, and felt impatient to diſſipate the apprehenſions of MARIA, to kiſs the pendant tear from her eye, and preſs his ſportive inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents to his boſom. While theſe bright ideas
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025208_0055_0FCCA2CEE2EF9698"/>
played round his ſoul, he lifted up his eyes, and through an opening in the woods beheld his farm: but what language can expreſs his ſurpriſe and conſternation at ſeeing his habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo ſuddenly deſolated! a loud exclamation of amaze burſt from the whole company at ſo unexpected a view—the blood revolted from Mr. KITTLE's cheek—his heart throbbed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the big emotion, and all aghaſt, ſpurring on his horſe, he entered the incloſure with full ſpeed.—Stop here unhappy man! here let the fibres of thy heart crack with excruciat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſery—let the cruel view of mangled wretches, ſo nearly allied to thee, extort drops of blood from thy cleaving boſom!—It did— it did. Uttering a deep groan he fell inſenſible from his horſe, while his attendants, haſtening towards him, were ſhocked beyond concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the diſmal ſpectacle; and, ſtarting back with averted eyes from the dead, were thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtruck, not having power to move or ſpeak. After awhile two Indians (who being uſed to ſanguinary ſcenes, recovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves firſt) took a blanket, and walking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to the mangled COMELIA, threw it over her naked body; the others then timidly
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:025208_0056_0FCCA2D0303A40A0"/>
advanced, and Mr. KITTLE opening his eyes, groaned again bitterly; then raiſing himſelf on his knees, with a look of unutterable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, he called upon his dear MARIA. Alas! no voice but the ſolemn repetition of his own cries was articulated to him: then riſing with an air of diſtraction, he ſtalked round the bloody ſcene, and examined the dead bodies; firſt uncovering the pale viſage of COMELIA, he ſurveyed in ſilence her diſtorted features; but perceiving it was not MARIA, he gently laid the cloth over again, and turning furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, caught up his ghaſtly infant, whoſe little body was black with contuſions, and his ſkull horribly fractured. Almoſt fainting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his mournful load, and ſtaggering at the dreadful diſcovery, he depoſited it again on the bloody earth, and clapping his hands to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether repeatedly with violence,
<q>O hell! hell!</q>
he cried,
<q>you cannot inflict tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſo exquiſite as thoſe I now ſuffer! how am I cruſhed to the center! how deeply am I degraded below the worms of the ſod! O my children! my children! where are you now? O my wife! my MARIA! the beloved of my boſom, are you
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025208_0057_0FCCA2D1B3880058"/>
too fallen a ſacrifice? Why do I ſurvive theſe miſeries, my God? how can mortality ſupport them? Burſt—burſt my ſhrinking heart, and puniſh a wretch for not having died in the defence of ſuch lovely and in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nocent beings! Oh! why was I abſent in this fatal hour? why did not their groans vibrate on my ſoul that I might have flown to their aid?</q>
Thus wildly lamenting and wandering among the ſmoaking ruins, he picked up ſome of the calcined bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> of his once beautiful ANNA. At this ſight deſpair ſhook his ſoul afreſh, new agonies convulſed his features, and dropping the ſad evidence of his miſeries, he extended his arms to Heaven, and roared out,
<q>Revenge! great God! re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge if thou art juſt and kind as repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! Oh! that I had the power of an arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel to thunder eternal horrors on the guilty wretches who have blaſted the bud of my happineſs, who have darkened the brighteſt eyes that ever opened on the light!</q>
            </p>
            <p>The men here interfering, to conſole him obſerved, the bones were probably thoſe of his brother PETER; but on finding his ſkeleton entire, Mr. KITTLE inſiſted that it muſt have
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025208_0058_0FCCA2D36526A2A8"/>
been MARIA and ANNA, who, having hid themſelves, had doubtleſs periſhed in the flames. Again, in the furious extravagance of paſſion, he tore the hair from his head, and caſting himſelf p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſtrate on the aſhes, he gathered the crumbling bones to his boſom, while the big drops of anguiſh iſſued at every pore, till life, unable longer to ſuſtain the mental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, ſuſpended her powers, and once more deprived him of ſenſation. His companions having laid him on a waggon, now conferred together in what manner to proceed, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending an attack from the ſavages, they unanimouſly concluded to lay the dead bodies on the remaining carriage, and make the beſt of their way to <hi>Schochticook,</hi> which they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly performed with great ſilence and expedition.</p>
            <p>You may judge, my dear, what a panic the appearance of this mournful cavalcade ſtruck over the inhabitants of this defenceleſs village. Mr. KITTLE was gently laid on a bed, and being let blood, his reſpiration became leſs obſtructed, though he continued ſenſeleſs till his unfortunate family were interred. Six weeks elapſed before he recovered any degree
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025208_0059_0FCCA2D4AA7B6978"/>
of ſtrength; but even then he appeared pale and emaciated, like a ſecond LAZARUS; his diſpoſition was entirely changed, his looks were fierce, his attitudes wild and extravagant, and his converſation, which formerly was ſenſible, commanding attent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on by a muſical voice, now was incoherent, and his cadence deep and hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, rather inſpiring terror than any pleaſing ſenſation. Thirſting for revenge, and perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſolitude only tended to corrode his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with the blackeſt melancholy, he ſoon after entered the Britiſh ſervice in the capacity of gentleman volunteer, and ſignalized him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by his prudence and intrepidity, attract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the particular notice of his officers, who being affected with his misfortunes, proffered their ſervices to him with ſo much friendſhip and candour, as obliged him to accept of them, and yet lightened the obligation.</p>
            <p>But doubtleſs, my dear, your generous ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility is alarmed at my ſilence about Mrs. KITTLE; I think we left her repoſing under a tree: ſhe was the firſt that awaked as the ſun began to exhale the cryſtal globules of morning, when half riſing, and reclining on her elbow, ſhe ſurveyed the lovely landſcape
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:025208_0060_0FCCA2D673C4E630"/>
around her with a deep ſigh; they were on an eminence that commanded an unlimited proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the country every way. The birds were cheerful; the dee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bounded fearleſs over the hills; the meadows bluſhed with the ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel of FLORA: but grief had ſaddened every object in her ſight; the whole creation ſeemed a dark blank to the fair mourner. Again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection unlocked the ſluices of her eyes, and her ſoft complaints diſturbed her ſavage com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who, riſing and kindling up the dying embers, began to prepare their victuals, which they invited her to partake of. This ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined with viſible deteſtation; and turning to her brother, with the dignity of conſcious merit in diſtreſs, "No," ſaid ſhe,
<q>I never will receive a morſel from thoſe bloody hands yet dropping with recent murder!—let me pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh—let the iron hand of famine firſt pinch out my vitals and ſend me after my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren!</q>
Notwithſtanding this, HENRY added his ſolicitations that ſhe ſhould accept of ſome refreſhment, remi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap>g her of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of her fatal reſolution, which could be deemed no otherwiſe than ſuicide. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this had no effect, he tried to touch her feelings on a ſofter key—
<q>Remember, MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIA,</q>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:025208_0061_0FCCA2D7A5768BB0"/>
ſaid he,
<q>you have a tender huſband yet living; would you wiſh to deprive him of every earthly conſolation? Would you add affliction to affliction, and after he has performed the ſorrowful obſequies of his children, to cruſh all his remaining hope by the news of your voluntary death? No, live my ſiſter! be aſſured he will ſoon get us exchanged, when ſoft ſympathies ſhall waſh away your ſorrows; and after a few years, who knows but the ſmiles of a new lovely progeny may again dawn a paradiſe of happineſs on you.</q>
MARIA was affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and half raiſing her eyes from the earth, ſhe replied,
<q>O my brother! how conſoling do your words ſink on my heart! though my reaſon tells me your arguments are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable and fallacious, yet it ſoothes the tempeſt of my ſoul—I will try to live— perhaps I may again behold my dear, dear, dear huſband!</q>
Here a flood of tears inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted her.</p>
            <p>As this converſation was held in Engliſh, the ſavages were inquiſitive to know the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it, at the ſame time enjoining them both never to utter a ſyllable in their preſence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

HENRY then informed them that his ſiſter, objecting to their method of preparing food, had deſired him to prevail with them to indulge her in dreſſing her meals herſelf.

               </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to HENRY, who cleaned and broiled them on ſticks, with an officious ſolicitude to pleaſe his ſiſter, which ſhe obſerved with a look of gratitude, and taking a pigeon from the ſtick, began to eat more from complaiſance than inclination. HENRY was delighted at her ready acquieſcence, and their repaſt being end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they proceeded on their tireſome journey with leſs repining than the preceding night. MARIA was exempted from carrying a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, yet ſhe found the fatigue almoſt intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. They continually paſſed through a ſcene of conflagration, the ſavages firing every cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in their way, whoſe mournful blaze catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:025208_0063_0FCCA2DAB400AEE0"/>
the dry fields of grain, would ſcorch off hundreds of acres in a few moments, and form a burning path for their deſtroyers. As the ſun advanced to his zenith, its rays beat fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on our travellers, augmented by the crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling flames around them; when meeting with a cool ſtream of water, MARIA was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to ſit down (being over-heated) while the reſt approached the rivulet: the Indian that guarded MARIA was ſtooping down to drink, when a loud ruſtling among the leaves and trampling of buſhes attracted his attention; he liſtened awhile ſeemingly much alarmed, then ſtarting up ſuddenly, he flew to MARIA, and caught hold of her hair, aiming his hatchet at her head: the conſequence was obvious, and her fate ſeemed inevitable; yet, with a ſtoical compoſure, ſhe folded her arms acroſs, and waited the fatal ſtroke with perfect reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but while the weapon was yet ſuſpended over her, chancing to look around, he perceived the noiſe to proceed from a large deer, whoſe antlers were entangled in the branches of a thicket. Though an uncivilized inhabitant of the foreſt, he bluſhed at his precipitancy, and returning the inſtrument of death to his
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025208_0064_0FCCA2DC777D5280"/>
girdle, after ſome heſitation made this apology:
<q>MARIA, this ſudden diſcovery is well for you; I thought we had been purſued, and we never ſuffer our priſoners to be re-taken; however, I was imprudent to attempt your life before there was a probability of your being reſcued<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </q>
then deſiring her to riſe and drink, he quickly ſhot the deer, his aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates helping him to ſkin it. Inſtead of quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her thirſt ſhe ſat down penſive on the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery margin, caſting he eyes careleſsly on the ſtream: ſhe knew not whether to eſteem her late deliverance from death a happy provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence or protraction of miſery. Obſerving the ſpotted trout, and other fiſh, to dart ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively acroſs the water, ſhe could not help exclaiming,
<q>Happy! happy animals! you have not the fatal gift of reaſon to embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter your pleaſures; you cannot anticipate your difficulties by apprehenſion, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long them by recollection; incapable of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending your Creator, the bleſſings of your exiſtence are ſecured to you: Alas! I envy the meaneſt among ye!</q>
A guſh of tears concluded her ſoliloquy; and being called to attend the company, ſhe aroſe, and they began
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:025208_0065_0FCCA2DDDACC9880"/>
their journey for the afternoon. HENRY de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring to have a piece of veniſon (having left it behind, ſeldom incommoding themſelves with more than the hide and tallow) they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and obliged him with a haunch, which was very fat: at the next interval of travel he dreſſed it for himſelf and MARIA. In the evening they croſſed the river ſomewhat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>Fort-Edward,</hi> in a canoe left hid under ſome buſhes for that purpoſe. They obſerved the moſt profound ſilence until they entered the woods again; but it was very late before they halted, which they did in a deep hollow, ſurrounded by pines whoſe tops ſeemed to be loſt in the clouds. It was neceſſary here to light a fire, for the wolves howled moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and the whole foreſt rung with the cries of wild beaſts of various ſorts. The confines of hell could not have given MARIA more diſmal ideas than her preſent ſituation: the horrid gloom of the place, the ſcowling looks of her murderous companions, the ſhrill ſhrieks of owls, the loud cries of the wolf, and mournful ſcreams of panthers, which were redoubled by diſtant echoes as the terrible ſounds ſeemed dying away, ſhook her frame
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:025208_0066_0FCCA2DF23854EB8"/>
with cold tremors—ſhe ſunk under the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of terror, and almoſt fainted in HENRY's arms; however, on perceiving the beaſts durſt not approach the light, but began to retire, ſhe became a little more aſſured, and helped HENRY to erect a booth of pine branches, making a bed of the ſame materials in it while he prepared their ſupper: having eaten, and kindled a large fire in the front of her arbour, ſhe laid down and ſoon fell in a deep ſleep. She felt herſelf refreſhed by this unexpected repoſe, and the next morning, with ſome alacrity, continued her journey, hoping at laſt to arrive at ſome Chriſtian ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement. Arriving at <hi>Lake-Champlain,</hi> they raiſed a wigwam on the bank, expecting the coming of Indians from the oppoſite ſhore to carry them over.</p>
            <p>Here our unfortunate captives were ſtript of their habits, already rent to pieces by briers, and attired each with remnants of old blankets. In this new dreſs Mrs. KITTLE ventured to expoſtulate with the ſavages, but it was talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtormy ocean; her complaints ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to divert them; ſo retiring among the buſhes, ſhe adjuſted her coarſe dreſs ſomewhat
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:025208_0067_0FCCA2E0A1923918"/>
decently, and then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>ing herſelf ſilently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſpreading tree, indulged herſelf in the luxury of ſorrow. HENRY, ſenſible that they expected more fortitude from him, and that if he ſunk under his adverſe fortune he ſhould be worſe treated, affected to be cheerful; he aſſiſted them in catching ſalmon, with which the lake abounds; an incredible quantity of wild fowl frequenting the lake alſo, he laid ſnares for thoſe of the leſſer ſort, (not being allowed fire-arms) and ſucceeded ſo well, that his dexterity was highly commended, and night coming on, they regaled themſelves on the fruits of their induſtry. The night was exceedingly dark, but calm; a thick miſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered over the woods, and the ſmall ridgy waves ſoftly rolled to the ſhore, when ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a large meteor, or fiery exhalation, paſſed by them with ſurpriſing velocity, caſting on every ſide ſhowers of brilliant ſparkles. At ſight of this phenomenon the Indians put their heads between their knees, crying out in a la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable voice, "Do not! do not! do not!" continuing in the ſame attitude until the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour diſappeared. HENRY, with ſome ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, demanded the reaſon of this exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:025208_0068_0FCCA2E2731FC0D8"/>
to which they replied,
<q>What he had ſeen was a fiery dragon on his paſſage to his den, who was of ſo malevolent a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that he never failed, on his arrival there, to inflict ſome peculiar calamity on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</q>
In about five minutes after the earth was violently agitated, the waves of the lake tumbled about in a ſtrange manner, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to emit flaſhes of fire, all the while attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with moſt tremendous roarings, intermixed with loud noiſes, not unlike the exploſion of heavy cannon. Soon as the Indians perceived it was an earthquake, they cried out,
<q>Now he comes home!</q>
and caſting themſelves in their former poſture, filled the air with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal howlings. This was a terrible ſcene to MARIA, who had never been witneſs to ſo dreadful a convulſion of Nature before; ſhe ſtarted up and fled from her ſavage companions towards an eminence at ſome diſtance, where, dropping on her knees, ſhe emphatically im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the protection of Heaven: however, ſhe was followed by an Indian and HENRY; the latter, highly affected with her diſtreſſes, taking hold of her trembling hand,
<q>But why, my ſiſter!</q>
ſaid he,
<q>have you fled from
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:025208_0069_0FCCA2E3A8879858"/>
us? is the gloom of a foreſt more cheering than the ſympathiſing looks of a friend?</q>
"No, my brother!" replied MARIA;
<q>but the thought was ſuggeſted to me, that the ſupreme God perhaps was preparing to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>enge himſelf of theſe murderers by ſome awful and uncommon judgment, and I fled from them as LOT did from <hi>Sodom,</hi> leſt I might be involved in the puniſhment of their guilt.</q>
They converſed in Engliſh, which diſpleaſing the Indian, he ordered them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the wigwam, threatening to bind MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIA faſt if ſhe offered to elope again. The ſhock being over, ſilence again ſpread through the realms of darkneſs, when a high wind aroſe from the north and chilled our half-naked travellers with exceſſive cold. The ſavages (whoſe callous ſkins were proof againſt the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clement weather) not caring to continue their fires, leſt they ſhould be diſcovered and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by ſome Engliſh party, they paſſed here a very uncomfortable night; but the wind ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding, and the ſky growing clear, the ſun roſe peculiarly warm and pleaſant, ſtreaming ten thouſand rays of gold acroſs the lake. MARIA had ſcarcely performed her oraiſons, when the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025208_0070_0FCCA2E5F608FA30"/>
ſavages, forming a circle round her and HENRY, began to dance in a moſt extravagant manner, and with antic geſtures that at another time would have afforded mirth to our travellers. Having continued their exerciſe ſome time, they incontinently drew out boxes of paint, and began to ornament their captives with a variety of colours; one having croſſed their faces with a ſtroke of vermilion, another would interſect it with a line of black, and ſo on until the whole company had given a ſpecimen of their ſkill or fancy.</p>
            <p>Soon after two canoes arrived, in which they paſſed over the lake, which was uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſerene and pleaſant. They proceeded not far on their way before they were obliged to halt for two days, on account of MARIA's inability to travel, her feet being greatly ſwoln and lacerated by the flinty path. At length, by eaſy ſtages, they came in view of an Indian ſettlement, when MARIA's long unbent fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures relaxed into a half ſmile, and turning to HENRY, "Here, my brother!" ſaid ſhe,
<q>I ſhall find ſome of my own ſex, to whom ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Nature, no doubt, has taught humanity; this is the firſt precept ſhe inculcates in the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:025208_0071_0FCCA2E81975D280"/>
female mind, and this they generally retain through life, in ſpite of every evil propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</q>
As ſhe uttered this elogium in favour of the fair, the tawny villagers, perceiving their approach, ruſhed promiſcuouſly from their huts with an execrable din, and fell upon the weary captives with clubs and a ſhower of ſtones, accompanying their ſtrokes with the moſt virulent language; among the reſt an old deformed ſquaw, with the rage of a Tiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phone, flew to MARIA, aiming a pine-knot at her head, and would certainly have given the wretched mourner her quietus had ſhe not been oppoſed by the ſavage that guarded Mrs. KITTLE: he at firſt mildly expoſtulated with his paſſionate countrywoman; but finding the old hag frantic, and inſatiable of blood, he twiſted the pine-knot from her hand and whirled it away to ſome diſtance, then ſeizing her arm roughly and tripping up her heels, he laid her proſtrate, leaving her to howl and yell at leiſure, which ſhe performed without a prompter.—MARIA was all in a tremor, and haſtily followed her deliverer, not caring to riſk another encounter with the exaſperated virago. By this time the rage and tumult of
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:025208_0072_0FCCA2E8E2799F60"/>
the ſavages ſubſiding, the new-comers were admitted into a large wigwam, in the center of which blazed a fire. After they were ſeated, ſeveral young Indians entered with baſkets of green maize in the ear, which, having roaſted before the fire, they diſtributed among the company.</p>
            <p>Mrs. KITTLE and her brother complaining of the bruiſes they met with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their reception, an old Indian ſeemed to attend with great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern; then leaving the place, in a little time returned with a bundle of aromatic herbs under his arm, the juice of which he expreſſed by rubbing them between two ſtones with flat ſurfaces; this he gave them to drink, applying the leaves externally. They inſtantly found relief from the medical quality of this extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary plant, and compoſing themſelves to ſleep, expected a good night's repoſe; but they were miſtaken, for their entertainers growing intoxicated with ſpirituous liquors, which ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating differently, it produced a moſt compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated noiſe of yelling, talking, ſinging, and quarrelling: this was a charm more powerful than the wand of Hermes to drive away ſleep: but grown familiar with ſorrow and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, MARIA regarded this as a trifle,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:025208_0073_0FCCA2EAC6C71F68"/>
and when HENRY expreſſed his concern for her ſmiling, ſhe replied,

            <p>It were endleſs to recapitulate minutely every diſtreſs that attended the priſoners in their tedious journey; let it ſuffice, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed through uncommon miſery, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger, they arrived at <hi>Montreal.</hi>— Here the ſavages were joined by ſeveral ſcalp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parties of their tribe, and having previouſly freſh painted themſelves, appeared in hideous pomp, and performed a kind of triumphal en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The throng of people that came out to meet them, threw MARIA in the moſt painful ſenſations of embarraſſment; but as the cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and inſults of the populace increaſed, a freezing torpor ſucceeded, and bedewed her limbs with a cold ſweat—ſtrange chimeras danced before her ſight—the actings of her foul were ſuſpended—ſhe ſeemed to move me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanically, nor recollected herſelf till ſhe found ſhe was ſeated in the Governor's hall, ſurrounded by an impertinent, inquiſitive cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of people<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who were inquiring into the cauſe of her diſorder, without attempting any thing towards her relief. Diſcovering her
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:025208_0074_0FCCA2EBE8C1BB28"/>
ſituation, ſhe bluſhingly withdrew to a dark corner from the public gaze, and could not help ſighing to herſelf,
<q>Alas! but a very few days ago I was hailed as the happieſt of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men—my fond huſband anticipated all my deſires—my children ſmiled round me with filial delight—my very ſervants paid me the homage due to an angel—O my God! what a ſudden, what a deplorable tranſition! I am fallen below contempt!</q>
As ſhe thus moralized on her ſituation, an Engliſh woman (whom humanity more than curioſity had drawn to the place) approached MARIA, and obſerving her tears and deep dejection, took hold of her hand, and endeavoured to ſmile; but the ſoft impulſes of nature were too ſtrong for the efforts of diſſimulation—her features inſtantly ſaddened again, and ſhe burſt into tears, exclaiming, (with a heſitating voice,)
<q>Poor, forlorn creature! where are thy friends! perhaps the dying moments of thy fond parent, or huſband, have been cruelly embittered with the ſight of thy captivity! perhaps now thy helpleſs orphan is mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the breaſt which gave him nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment! or thy plaintive little ones are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering

<q>your pity is ſeverer than ſavage cruelty—I could ſtand the ſhook of fortune with ſome degree of firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but your ſoft ſympathy opens afreſh the wounds of my ſoul! my loſſes are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond your conjecture—I have no parent, no ſportive children, and, I believe, no huſband, to mourn and wiſh for me!</q>
Theſe words were ſucceeded by an affecting ſilence on both ſides: meanwhile the Indians teſtified their impatience to be admitted to the Governor by frequent ſhouts; at length his Excellency appeared, and having held a long conference with the ſavages, they retired with his Secretary, and our priſoners ſaw them no more.</p>
            <p>After their exit the Governor turning round to MARIA and HENRY, demanded who they were? Mrs. KITTLE's perplexity prevented her reply; but HENRY, in a moſt reſpectful manner, gave him a ſuccinct account of their misfortunes. The Governor perceiving him ſenſible and communicative, interrogated him farther, but he modeſtly declined giving any
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:025208_0076_0FCCA2EEEB9C4A98"/>
political intelligence. Obſerving that MARIA ſuffered greatly in this interview, he ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it, after having preſented ſeveral pieces of calicoes and ſtuffs to them, deſiring they would accept what they had occaſion for. Mrs. KITTLE immediately ſingled out a piece of black calimanco with tears of gratitude to her benefactor; who, ſmiling, obſerved ſhe might chuſe a gayer colour, as he hoped her diſtreſſes were now over. MARIA ſhook her head in token of diſſent, but could make no reply. He then diſmiſſed them, with a ſmall guard, who was directed to provide them with decent lodgings.</p>
            <p>HENRY was accommodated at a baker's, while his ſiſter, to her no ſmall ſatisfaction, found herſelf placed at the Engliſh woman's who, on her arrival, had expreſſed ſo much good nature. She had ſcarcely entered, when Mrs. D—, preſenting her with a cordial, led her to a couch, inſiſting on her repoſing there a little, "for," ſays ſhe,
<q>your waſte of ſpirits requires it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This tenderneſs, which MARIA had long been a ſtranger to, relaxed every fibre of her heart: ſhe again melted into tears; but it was a
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:025208_0077_0FCCA2F0C9583640"/>
guſh of grateful acknowledgment, that called a modeſt bluſh of pleaſure and perplexity on Mrs. D—'s cheek. Being left alone, ſhe ſoon fell in a profound ſleep; and her friend having prepared a comfortable repaſt, in leſs than an hour awaked her, with an invitation to dinner—
<q>And how do you find yourſelf, my ſiſter?</q>
ſaid ſhe inſtinctively, ſeizing MARIA's hand and compreſſing it between her's;
<q>may we hope that you will aſſiſt us in conquering your dejection?</q>
—MARIA ſmiled benignly through a cryſtal atmoſphere of tears, and kiſſing the hand of her friend, aroſe. Having dined, and being now equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in decent apparel, MARIA became the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and eſteem of the whole family. The tempeſt of her ſoul ſubſided in a ſolemn calm; and though ſhe did not regain her vivacity, ſhe became agreeably converſable.</p>
            <p>In a few days, however, ſhe felt the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of an approaching fever. She was alarmed at this, and intimating to Mrs. D— her fears of becoming troubleſome,
<q>Do not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,</q>
returned that kind creature;
<q>my God did not plant humanity in my breaſt to remain there an inactive principle.</q>
MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIA
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025208_0078_0FCCA2F244AB82C8"/>
felt her oppreſſion relieved by this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſentiment; and indeed found her friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip did not conſiſt in profeſſion, as ſhe inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly tended her during her illneſs with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible delicacy and ſolicitude. When ſhe was again on the recovery, Mrs. D— one day ordered a ſmall trunk covered with Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco leather to be brought before her, and opening it, produced ſeveral ſets of fine linen, with ſome elegant ſtuffs and other neceſſaries. —"See," ſaid ſhe,
<q>what the benevolence of <hi>Montreal</hi> has done for you. The ladies that beg your acceptance of theſe things, intend likewiſe to enhance the favour, by waiting on you this afternoon.</q>—"Ah!" interrupted MARIA,
<q>I want them not; this one plain habit is enough to anſwer the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of dreſs for me. Shut the cheſt, my dear Mrs. D—, and keep them as a ſmall compenſation for the immenſe trouble I have been to you.</q>—<q>If this is your real ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,</q>
replied her friend, (ſhutting<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the cheſt, and preſenting her the key,)
<q>return your gifts to the donors; and ſince you will reward me for my little offices of friendſhip, only love me, and believe me diſintereſted,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025208_0079_0FCCA2F372891E58"/>
and I ſhall be overpaid.</q>—<q>I ſee I have wronged your generoſity,</q>
anſwered MA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIA.
<q>Pardon me, my ſiſter, I will offend no more. I did not think you mercenary— but—but—I meant only to diſengage my heart of a little of its burden.</q>—As this tender conteſt was painful to both parties, Mrs. D— riſing abruptly, pretended ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, promiſing to return again directly.</p>
            <p>In the afternoon MARIA received her viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants in a neat little parlour. She was dreſſed in a plain ſuit of mourning, and wore a ſmall muſlin cap, from which her hair fell in artleſs curls on her fine neck: her face was pale, though not emaciated, and her eyes ſtreamed a ſoft languor over her countenance, more bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than the ſprightlieſt glances of vivacity. As they entered ſhe aroſe, and advancing, modeſtly received their civilities, while Mrs. D— handed them to chairs: but hearing a well-known voice, ſhe haſtily lifted up her eyes, and ſcreamed out in an accent of ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
<q>Good Heaven! may I credit my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? My dear Mrs BRATT, my kind neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, is it really you that I ſee?</q>
Here ſhe found herſelf claſped in her friend's arms,

               </gap>ears. The tumult of paſſion at length abating —"Could I have gueſſed, my MARIA," ſaid ſhe,
<q>that you was here, my viſit ſhould not have been deferred a moment after your arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; but I have mourned with a ſiſter in affliction, (permit me to preſent her to you,) and while our hearts were wrung with each other's diſtreſs, alas! we inquired after no foreign calamity.</q>
Being all ſeated,
<q>I dare not,</q>
reſumed MARIA,

cried Mrs. BRATT;
<q>but if you can bear the recollection of your misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, do oblige me with the recital.</q>
The ladies joined their intreaty, and Mrs. KITTLE complied in a graceful manner.</p>
            <p>After ſome time ſpent in tears, and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing melancholy, tea was brought in; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſun-ſet Mrs. D— invited the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to walk in the garden, which being very ſmall, conſiſted only of a parterre, at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther end of which ſtood an arbour covered with a grape-vine. Here being ſeated, after ſome chat on indifferent ſubjects, MARIA de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired

Mrs. BRATT, (if agreeable to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany) to acquaint her with the circumſtances of her capture. They all bowed approbation; and after ſome heſitation Mrs. BRATT be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan:—</p>
            <p>
               <q>My heart, ladies, ſhall ever retain a ſenſe of the happineſs I enjoyed in the ſociety of Mrs. KITTLE and ſeveral other amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble perſons in the vicinage of <hi>Schochticook,</hi> where I reſided. She in particular cheered my lonely hours of widowhood, and omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nothing that ſhe thought might conduce to my ſerenity. I had two ſons; ſhe recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the education of them to my leiſure hours. I accepted of her advice, and found a ſuſpenſion of my ſorrows in the execution of my duty. They ſoon improved beyond my capacity of teaching. RICHARD, my eldeſt, was paſſionately fond of books, which he ſtudied with intenſe application. This naturally attached him to a ſedentary life, and he became the conſtant inſtructive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of my evening hours. My youngeſt ſon, CHARLES, was more volatile, yet not leſs agreeable; his perſon was charming, his wit ſprightly, and his addreſs elegant.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:025208_0082_0FCCA2F7EDB1FB98"/>
They often importuned me, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of this war, to withdraw to <hi>Albany</hi>; bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, as I apprehended no danger, (the Britiſh troops being ſtationed above us, quite from <hi>Saratoga</hi> to the Lake) I ridicul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their fea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>One evening as my ſons were come in from reaping, and I was buſied in preparing them a diſh of tea, we were ſurpriſed by a diſcharge of muſkerry near us We all three ran to the door, and beheld a party of Indians not twenty paces from us. Struck with aſtoniſhment, we had no power to move; and the ſavages again firing that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, my CHARLES dropped down dead beſide me. Good God! what were my emotions! But language would fail, ſhould I attempt to deſcribe them. My ſurviving ſon then turning to me, with a countenance expreſſive of the deepeſt horror, urged me to fly. "Let us be gone this inſtant," ſaid he;
<q>a moment determines our fate. O my mother! you are already loſt.</q>
But deſpair had ſwallowed up my fears; I fell ſhrieking on the body of my child, and rending away my hair, endeavoured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:025208_0083_0FCC8E95663C0278"/>
him to life with unavailing laments. RICHARD, in the meanwhile, had quitted me, and the moment after I beheld him mounted on horſeback, and ſtretching away to the city. The Indians fired a volley at him, but miſſed, and, I flatter myſelf that he arrived ſafe. And now, not all my prayers and tears could prevent the wretches from ſcalping my precious child. But when they rent me away from him, and dragged me from the houſe, my grief and rage burſt forth like a hurricane. I execrated their whole race, and called for eternal ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to cruſh them to atoms. After a while I grew aſhamed of my impetuoſity: the tears began again to flow ſilently on my cheek; and, as I walked through the foreſt between two Indians, my ſoul grew ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſick and groaned in me; a darkneſs, more ſubſtantial than Egyptian night, fell upon it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and my exiſtence became an inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able burthen to me. I looked up to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with a hopeleſs kind of awe, but I murmured no more at the diſpenſations of my God; and in this frame of ſullen reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I paſſed the reſt of my journey, which
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:025208_0084_0FCCA2FB091BAE28"/>
being nearly ſimilar to Mrs. KITTLE's, I ſhall avoid the repetition of. And now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me (ſaid ſhe, turning to the French la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) to acknowledge your extreme goodneſs to me. I was a ſtranger, ſick and naked, and you took me in. You indeed have proved the good Samaritan to me, pouring oil and wine in my wounds.</q>—<q>Huſh, huſh! (cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Madame DE ROCHE,) you eſtimate our ſervices at too high a rate. I ſee you are no connoiſſeur in minds: there is a great deal of honeſt hoſpitality in the world, though you have met with ſo little.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I now reject, (interrupted Mrs. BRATT,) all prejudices of education. From my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy have I been taught that the French were a cruel perfidious enemy, but I have found them quite the reverſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Madame DE R. willing to change the ſubject, accoſted the other ſtranger,—<q>Dear Mrs. WILLIS, ſhall we not be intereſted likewiſe in your misfortunes?</q>—<q>Ah! do, (added Mademoiſelle V.) my heart is now ſweetly tuned to melancholy.

<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025208_0085_0FCCA2FC76DCD0A8"/>
then took hold of Mrs. WILLIS's hand, and preſſed her to oblige them.—Mrs. WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIS bowed. She dropt a few tears; but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming a compoſed look, ſhe began:—</p>
            <p>
               <q>I am the daughter of a poor clergyman, who being confined to his chamber by ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for ſeveral years, amuſed himſelf by educating me. At his death, finding my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf friendleſs, and without money, I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the hand of a young man who had taken a leaſed farm in Pennſylvania. He was very agreeable, and extravagantly fond of me. We lived happily for many years in a kind of frugal affluence. When the ſavages began to commit outrages on the frontier ſettlements, our neighbours, intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated at their rapid approaches, erected a ſmall fort, ſurrounded by a high paliſade. Into this the more timorous drove their cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle at night, and one evening, as we were at ſupper, my huſband (being ordered on guard) inſiſted that I ſhould accompany him with the children (for I had two lovely girls, one turned of thirteen years, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other of ſix months.) My SOPHIA aſſented to the propoſal with joy.
<q>Mamma<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     <pb n="75" facs="unknown:025208_0086_0FCCA2FE229EB390"/>
(ſaid ſhe,) what a merry woman the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's wife is; ſhe will divert us the whole evening, and ſhe is very fond of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: come, I will take our little CHAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOTTE on my arm, and papa will carry the lantern.</q>
I acceded with a nod; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready the dear charmer had handed me my hat and gloves, when ſomebody thundered at the door. We were ſilent as death, and inſtantly after plainly could diſtinguiſh the voices of ſavages conferring together. Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led as I was with fear, I flew to the cradle, and catching my infant, ran up into a loft. SOPHIA followed me all trembling, and panting for breath caſt herſelf in my boſom. Hearing the Indians enter, I looked through a crevice in the floor, and ſaw them, with menacing looks, ſeat themſelves round the table, and now and then addreſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to Mr. WILLIS, who, all pale and aſtoniſhed, neither underſtood nor had power to anſwer them. I obſerved they took a great pleaſure in terrifying him, by flouriſhing their knives, and gaſhing the table with their hatchets. Alas! this ſight ſhot icicles to my ſoul; and, to increaſe my
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025208_0087_0FCCA2FF6F02BE88"/>
diſtreſs, my SOPHIA's little heart beat againſt my breaſt, with redoubled ſtrokes, at every word they uttered.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Having finiſhed their repaſt in a glutti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous manner, they laid a fire-brand in each corner of the chamber, and then departed, driving poor Mr. WILLIS before them. The ſmoke ſoon incommoded us; but we dreaded our barbarous enemy more than the fire. At length, however, the flames be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to invade our retreat, trembling and apprehenſive, we ventured down ſtairs; the whole houſe now glowed like a furnace; the flames rolled towards the ſtairs, which we haſtily deſcended; but juſt as I ſat my foot on the threſhold of the door, a piece of timber, nearly conſumed through, gave way, and fell on my left arm, which ſupported my infant, miſerably fracturing the bone. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly caught up my fallen lamb, and haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened to overtake my SOPHIA. There was a large hollow tree contiguous to our houſe, with an aperture juſt large enough to admit ſo ſmall a woman as I am. Here we had often laughingly propoſed to hide our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, in caſe of a viſit from the olive colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:025208_0088_0FCCA300E9C33538"/>
natives. In this we now took ſhelter; and being ſeated ſome time, my ſoul ſeemed to awake as it were from a viſion of horror: I lifted up my eyes, and beheld the cottage that lately circumſcribed all my worldly wealth and delight, melting away before the devouring fire. I dropt a tear as our apoſtate firſt parents did when thruſt out from <hi>Eden.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The world lay all before them, where to chuſe their place of reſt, and Providence their guide. Ah, EVE! thought I, hadſt thou been like me, ſolitary, maimed, and unprotected, thy ſituation had been deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable indeed. Then preſſing my babe to my heart,
<q>How quiet art thou, my angel, (ſaid I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And here ſhe kiſſed my babe and me with vehemence. When her tranſports were moderated.
<q>How cold my ſiſter is, (ſaid ſhe,) do wrap her up warmer, mamma; poor thing, ſhe is not uſed to ſuch uncomfortable lodging.</q>
               </q>

               <q>The pain of my arm now called for all my fortitude and attention; but I forbore to mention this afflicting circumſtance to my daughter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The cheerful ſwallow now began to uſher in the dawn with melody; we timidly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to quit our hiding place; and turning round to the light, I caſt an anxious eye of love on my innocent, wondering that ſhe ſlept ſo long. But oh! horror and miſery! I beheld her a pale, ſtiff corpſe in my arms; (ſuffer me to weep, ladies, at the cruel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection.) It ſeems the piece of wood that diſabled me, had alſo cruſhed my CHAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOTTE's tender ſkull, and no wonder my hapleſs babe was quiet. I could no longer ſuſtain my ſorrowful burden, but falling proſtrate, almoſt inſenſible at the dreadful diſcovery, uttered nothing but groans. SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHIA's little heart was too ſuſceptible for ſo moving a ſcene. Diſtracted between her concern for me, and her grief for the loſs of her dear ſiſter, ſhe caſt herſelf beſide me, and with the ſofteſt voice of ſorrow, bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fate of her beloved CHARLOTTE— her ſweet companion—her innocent, laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

play-fellow. At length we roſe, and SOPHIA, claſping all that remained of my cherub in her arms,
<q>Ah! (ſaid ſhe,) I did engage to carry you, my ſiſter, but little did I expect in this diſtreſſing manner.</q>
When we came in ſight of the fort, though I endeavoured to ſpirit up my grieved child, yet I found my ſprings of action begin to move heavily, my heart fluttered, and I ſuddenly fainted away. SOPHIA<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was dead, uttered ſo piercing a cry, that the centinel looking up, immediately called to thoſe in the fort to aſſiſt us. When I recovered, I found myſelf in a bed encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled by my kind neighbours, who divided their expreſſions of love and condolement between me and my child. I remained in the fort after this; but, ladies, you may think, that bereft as I was of ſo kind a huſband and endearing child, I ſoon found myſelf ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and deſtitute. I wept inceſſantly; and hearing nothing from my dear WILLIS, I at length reſolved to traverſe the wilds of <hi>Canada</hi> in purſuit of him.

<pb n="80" facs="unknown:025208_0091_0FCCA30628B75700"/>
they furniſhed me with ſome money and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, and obtained a permiſſion from the Governor to let me go under protection of a flag that was on the way. Hearing likewiſe that a cartel was drawn for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of priſoners, I ſat out, fluſhed with hope, and with indefatigable induſtry and painful ſolicitude, arrived at <hi>Montreal,</hi> worn to a ſkeleton (as you ſee ladies) with fatigue.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I omitted not to inquire of every officer, the names of priſoners who had been brought in. At length I underſtood that Mr. WIL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIS had periſhed in jail, on his firſt arrival, of a dyſentery.—Here my expectations ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in deſpair. I had no money to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with, and indeed but for my SOPHIA no inclination—the whole world ſeemed dark and cheerleſs to me as the fabled re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Cimmeria, and I was nigh periſhing for very want, when Mrs. BRATT, hearing of my diſtreſs, ſought my acquaintance: ſhe kindly participated my ſorrows, and too— too generouſly ſhared her purſe and bed with me. This, ladies, is the ſtory of a broken-hearted woman, nor ſhould I have intruded it in any other but the houſe of mourning.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:025208_0092_0FCCA307B3E998B8"/>Here ſhe concluded, while the ladies ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally embracing her, expreſſed their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments for the painful taſk ſhe had complied with to oblige their curioſity.— "Would to Heaven!" ſaid Madame DE R.
<q>that the brutal nations were extinct, for never—never can the united humanity of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Britain</hi> compenſate for the horrid cruelties of their ſavage allies.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They were ſoon after ſummoned to an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant collation; and having ſpent beſt part of the night together, the gueſts retired to their reſpective homes.</p>
            <p>During two years, in which the French ladies continued their bounty and friendſhip to Mrs. KITTLE, ſhe never could gain the leaſt intelligence of her huſband. Her letters, after wandering through ſeveral provinces, would often return to her hands unopened. Deſpairing at length of ever ſeeing him, "Ah!" ſhe would ſay to Mrs. D—,
<q>my poor huſband has undoubtedly periſhed, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps in his fruitleſs ſearch after me, and I am left to be a long—long burden on your goodneſs, a very unprofitable dependant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="82" facs="unknown:025208_0093_0FCCA3094CDD4620"/>In her friend's abſence ſhe would deſcend into the kitchen, and ſubmit to the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial offices; nor could the ſervants prevent her; however, they appriſed Mrs. D— of it, who ſeized an opportunity of detecting her at her labour. Being baffled in her humble attempt by the gentle reproaches of her indulgent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs, ſhe ſat down on the ſtep of the door, and began to weep.
<q>I believe, good Mrs. D—,</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q>were you a hard taſk-maſter, that exacted from theſe uſeleſs hands the moſt ſlaviſh buſineſs, I could acquit my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with cheerfulneſs: my heart is like ice, that brightens and grows firmer by tempeſts, but cannot ſtand the warm rays of a kind. ſun.</q>
Mrs. D— was beginning to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, when hearing a tumult in the ſtreet, they both haſted to the door, and MARIA, caſting her eyes careleſſly over the crowd, in an inſtant recognized the features of her long-lamented huſband, who ſprang towards her with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcribable and involuntary rapture: but the tide of joy and ſurpriſe was too ſtrong for the delicacy of her frame: ſhe gave a faint excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and ſtretching out her arms to receive him, dropped ſenſeleſs at his feet. The ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:025208_0094_0FCCA30B70ED8728"/>
of his ideas was too rapid to admit deſcribing. He caught her up, and bearing her in the hall, laid his precious burden on a ſettee, kneeling beſide her in a ſpeechleſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gony of delight and concern. Meanwhile the ſpectators found themſelves wonderfully affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—the tender contagion ran from boſom to boſom—they wept aloud; and the houſe of joy ſeemed to be the houſe of lamentation. At length MARIA opened her eyes and burſt into a violent fit of tears—Mr. KITTLE, with anſwering emotions, ſilently accompanying her; then claſping his arms endearingly round her, "It is enough, my love," ſaid he,
<q>we have had our night of affliction, and ſurely this bleſſed meeting is a preſage of a long day of future happineſs; let me kiſs off thoſe tears, and ſhew by your ſmiles that I am indeed welcome.</q>
MARIA then bending fondly forward to his boſom, replied, ſighing,
<q>Alas! how can your beggared wife give you a proper reception? ſhe cannot reſtore your prattling babes to your arms—ſhe comes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone! Alas! her preſence will only ſerve to remind you of the treaſures—the filial delights you have loſt!</q>
—"God forbid,"
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:025208_0095_0FCCA30CE8608470"/>
anſwered he,
<q>that I ſhould repine at the loſs of my ſmaller comforts, when ſo capital a bleſſing as my beloved MARIA is ſo won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully reſtored to me.</q>
Here he was in civility obliged to riſe and receive the compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Mrs. BRATT, Mrs. WILLIS, and Madame DE R—, who, hearing of his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, entered juſt then, half breathleſs with impatience and joy. The company increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; an elegant dinner was prepared: in ſhort, the day was devoted to pleaſure; and never was ſatisfaction more general—feſtivity glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on every face, and complacency dimpled every cheek.</p>
            <p>After tea MARIA withdrew in the garden, to give her beloved an account of what had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen her during their ſeparation. The elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of ſorrow is irreſiſtible. Mr. KITTLE wept, he groaned, while all impaſſioned (with long interruptions of grief in her voice) ſhe ſtammered through her doleful hiſtory; and yet ſhe felt a great ſatisfaction in pouring her complaints into a boſom whoſe feelings were in uniſon with her's—they wept—they ſmiled —they mourned, and rejoiced alternately, with an abrupt tranſition from one paſſion to another.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:025208_0096_0FCCA30E66BD3C80"/>Mr. KITTLE, in return, informed her, that having thrown himſelf into the army, in hopes of ending a being that grew inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able under the reflection of paſt happineſs, he tempted death in every action wherein he was engaged, and being diſappointed, gave himſelf up to the blackeſt melancholy.
<q>This gloomy ſcene,</q>
he obſerved,
<q>would ſoon have been cloſed by ſome act of deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but one evening, ſitting penſive in his tent, and attentively running over the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of his misfortunes, a thought darted on his mind that poſſibly his brother HENRY might be alive.</q>
This was the firſt time the idea of any one of his family's ſurviving the general murder had preſented it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to him, and he caught at the flattering ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion as a drowning wretch would at a plank. "Surely, ſurely," ſaid he,
<q>my brother lives—it is ſome divine emanation lights up the thought in my ſoul—it carries convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with it: I will go after him—it ſhall be the comfort and employment of my life to find out this dear brother—this laſt and only treaſure.</q>
Perſuaded of the reality of his fancy, he communicated his deſign to a
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:025208_0097_0FCCA31015408188"/>
few of his military friends; but they only laughed at his extravagance, and ſtrongly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him from ſo wild an undertaking. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcouraged, he deſiſted; but ſhortly after, hearing that a company of priſoners (who were enfranchiſed) were returning to <hi>Quebec,</hi> he got permiſſion to accompany them. After a very fatiguing journey he arrived at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treal,</hi> and was immediately introduced to the General Officer, who patiently heard his ſtory, and treated him with great clemency. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained leave to remain a few days in town, he reſpectfully withdrew, and turning down a ſtreet he inquired of a man who was walking before him, where lodgings were to be let? The ſtranger turned about, civilly taking off his hat, when Mr. KITTLE, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing back, grew as pale as aſhes—
<q>Oh, my God!</q>
cried he, panting,
<q>oh! HENRY, is it you! is it indeed you! No, it cannot be.</q>
Here he was ready to fall; but HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY, with little leſs agitation, ſupported him; and a tavern being at hand, he led him in. The maſter of the hotel brought in wine, and they drank off many glaſſes to congratulate ſo happy a meeting. When their tranſports were
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:025208_0098_0FCCA31176489B40"/>
abated, HENRY ventured to tell him that his MARIA was living and well. This was a weight of joy too ſtrong for his enfeebled pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers—he ſtared wildly about. At length, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering himſelf, "Take care, HENRY," ſaid he, "this is too tender a point to trifle upon." —"My brother," replied HENRY,
<q>be calm, let not your joy have a worſe effect than your grief—they both came ſudden, and it behoves a man and a chriſtian to ſhew as much fortitude under the one as the other.</q>
—<q>Alas! I am prepared for ſome woeful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,</q>
cried Mr. KITTLE; but, "HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY, this ſuſpence is cruel."—<q>By the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal God!</q>
rejoined his brother,
<q>your MARIA, your wife, is in this town, and if you are compoſed enough, you ſhall imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſee her.</q>
Mr. KITTLE could not ſpeak—he gave his hand to HENRY, and while (like the Apoſtles friends) he believed not for joy, he was conducted to her arms, and found his bliſs wonderfully real.</p>

            <head>THE STORY OF HENRY AND ANNE. FOUNDED ON FACT.</head>
            <p>HENRY and ANNE were born in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> in the Marquiſate of <hi>Bade<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents dwelt contiguous to each other, and the moſt ſentimental friendſhip ſubſiſted between the two families. ANNE was graceful even in infancy; HENRY tall and majeſtie, ſtrong and active, though not regularly beautiful their poverty early introduced them on the fields: their little hands were lacerated by the bearded grain, and their tender feet wounded by the aſperities of a flinty ſoil. ANNE's lovely complexion ſoon loſt its delicate white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but was amply recompenſed by the bloom
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:025208_0100_0FCC8EB69044F290"/>
of luxuriant health. Whilſt they toiled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in gathering the ſtones from the green ſurface of a meadow, or weeding the vines, the courtly paſſenger would ſtop and gave with pity to ſee ſo much elegance and beauty of form joined to the ſervility of unremitted la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. HENRY redoubled his exertions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to leſſen little ANNE's fatigue; and when their taſk was done, they rejoined their companions, aſſiſted them to complete their work, and with gleeful hearts ſported them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſleep.</p>
            <p>Nor were the old farmers diſpleaſed to ſee the growing affection between their children: "We ſhall ſoon be cloſer united," ſaid they:
<q>HENRY and ANNE (our only offspring) ſhall cement our friendſhip, and perpetuate our names to remoteſt centuries.</q>
Alas! in the midſt of this inchanting viſion, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, attended by a file of muſqueteers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded HENRY. He was now ſeventeen, full grown, and muſt enter his Lord's ſervice. It was in vain to expoſtulate. Without a fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well ſigh from ANNE, or ſcarce an embrace from his diſtracted parents, he muſt depart. Being eſcorted to a diſtant town, he was there
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:025208_0101_0FCC8EB7F4076988"/>
initiated into all the military manoeuvers, and three weeks after joined his regiment, which left that part of <hi>Germany</hi> ſoon after. HENRY's diſappointed love ſunk him into melancholy— he grew <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> promotion if he would continue in his company.
<q>I bluſh to decline my officer's generous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal,</q>
ſaid HENRY;
<q>but it is better to be virtuous than fortunate— I have left three broken hearts at home, I muſt haſten to heal them—the ſoft voice of my ANNE calls me from the thunder of <hi>Bellona.</hi>
               </q>—"Go," ſaid his commander in a ſoftened tone,
<q>I know what love is—my HENRY can be happy, I only great;</q>
then dropping a tear,
<q>Go HENRY—farewell—I know you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to be happier than I am.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:025208_0102_0FCC8EC335AD8BF0"/>The interview between the lovers was ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and romantic.—ANNE, to conſole her HENRY's parents, remitted not her aſſiduities to pleaſe them. She cultivated their garden; ſhe culled the richeſt fruit and brighteſt flowers to amuſe them: her active fingers extended an imperceptible thread of flax to provide them linen of finer texture than the product of Egyptian looms: ſhe reſiſted the importunity of HENRY's rivals heroically, while her old father, weeping for joy, commended her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy. "My child," ſaid he,
<q>thou art no diſgrace to thy lineage; HENRY loves thee, he is worthy of thee, and worthy of every ſacrifice thou canſt make him; cheer up my little one, he will ſoon return.</q>—<q>No, my father, ſome inexorable ſhot will cleave his brave heart.</q>
So ſaying, ſhe roſe agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated from weeding a bed of lupins, when a foot ſoldier approached. Scarce had the old man civilly accoſted the ſtranger over the hedge, when ANNE ſcreamed out,
<q>Oh heaven! father, it is our HENRY, our own HEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY.</q>—In an inſtant the family was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened; from tears they made abrupt tranſitions to mirth, which ſoon caught the cars of the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:025208_0103_0FCC8EC568BF51F8"/>
good neighbours, who came in crouds to feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citate the ſoldier's arrival. His parents invited them to return the next day and ſhare the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral feſtivity, which they freely accepted, and aſſiſted to ſlaughter the poultry and fatteſt lambs. The entertainment was truly paſtoral. The tables were ſpread in the vineyard, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath verdant arches that were impurpled by weighty cluſters of grapes; a guſhing fountain cloſe by diſpenſed a delicious coolneſs, and baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets of flowers filled the air with balmy ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. To heighten the ſcene, the ſilvery airs of muſic, from the violin, harp, and melli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous flute, ſoftly circled through the ſky. In ſhort, a prieſt was called and our lovers married.</p>
            <p>For two years peace and plenty were their houſhold gods; but then HENRY ſeeing a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily increaſing, began to reflect on the means of ſupporting them. He had no land, and had never been taught any mechanical branch of buſineſs; however, after taking advice, he purchaſed a ſmall ſtock of merchandiſe, and prepared to follow the army. The good parents exhauſted themſelves to increaſe his commodities. "Be frugal and cautious, ſon,"
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025208_0104_0FCC8EC6EC0E32C0"/>
ſaid they; "remember ANNE and her babe." —"Ah!" cried HENRY, embracing them,
<q>if I diſhonour my parents, take ANNE from my boſom, give my paradiſe to a ſtranger, and let me die the death of a villain!</q>
            </p>
            <p>HENRY viſited his beloved friends frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but the army being ſtationed at a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able diſtance from them, after an interval of three years, he ſighed in abſence near eleven months; he had accumulated eight hundred pounds in caſh by extraordinary application, which compenſated in ſome meaſure this pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeparation, when he received a ſummons to return home. It ſeems his father-in-law had been diſpoſſeſſed of his farm, through inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to diſcharge his rent. The good old man retired with his child to HENRY's parents, where they were cordially received; but grief made inſenſible inroads in his conſtitution; in leſs than three weeks (having languiſhed a few days) he died in ANNE's arms.</p>
            <p>HENRY burſt into tears at the news.
<q>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el parent,</q>
ſaid he,
<q>you knew my happy ſituation—why did you let the canker of diſappointment abridge your days? my trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was your own—I am infinitely your
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025208_0105_0FCC8EC86D8EB458"/>
debtor—I never yet earned my RACHEL.</q>
—Having paid a tribute of ſincere drops of gratitude and love, he ſighed and went to bed; he ſlumbered, and ſaw his ANNE ſmile with joy at the gold and ſilver he poured at her feet: his little ones climbed his knees, and ſeemed to be delighted with the glitter of his treaſures: his enamoured fancy called up every pleaſing idea to ſport round his innocent family, when he was ſuddenly awaked by four ruffians, who entered his tent well armed; and, advancing to his bed, bade him be ſilent, at the peril of immediate deſtruction. Regardleſs of their menaces, he ſtarted up and demanded their buſineſs; upon which they ſeized and bound him hand and foot, then fell to rummaging the tent. They ſoon diſcovered his money— what a glorious booty! In vain did he plead, ſoothe, and threaten.
<q>Leave me a few pieces: leave me but a little, a very little, to carry me to my poor wife and children.</q>
His rhetoric made no impreſſion—they left him not a ſous.</p>
            <p>Being at ſome diſtance from the camp, his repeated calls for help were not heard; at length, in the ſilence of midnight, a centinel
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:025208_0106_0FCC8EC9F641BD70"/>
diſtinguiſhed a mournful cry for aſſiſtance, and ſent a couple of veterans to reconnoitre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> HENRY, now relieved from corporeal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, began to feel his heart contracted and ſhrunk by ideas of approaching beggary. He looked round him; the whole creation ſeemed comfortleſs and deſolate.
<q>How ſhall I behold my domeſtic bleſſings? how ſhall I look ANNE in the face? would to God I had tilled ſome ſterile ſpot of ground, we would have been content in indigence; na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture would have been ſatisfied with herbs and lentils. Curſed ambition to be rich has ruined me, and I am a traitor to my fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</q>
With theſe bitter reflections the day broke, and having collected the little furniture of his tent, he diſpoſed of it to advantage to the humane ſoldiery, who univerſally loved him and pitied his misfortunes. Having ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured his caſh in a ſmall bag, he ſet off with a reluctant ſtep for home. In vain did the birds carol on the elms that ſhaded the road. In vain did the ploughman whiſtle gleefully, and the lambs wanton o'er the green hillocks. No enlivening ſcene could diſſipate his melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="unknown:025208_0107_0FCC8ED9B002B5E0"/>He protracted his journey through fear of being too ſoon the meſſenger of ill tidings. On the ſecond day at noon, having bought a loaf of bread, he ſat down by a rivulet to eat; his tears flowed apace, and he began to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate whether he ſhould return to ANNE or not. He counted his little ſtore, and fell liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs on the graſs through deſpondency. While thus he lay ſadly ruminating, a handſome cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (thinking themſelves unobſerved) paſſed through the buſhes. "Alas!" ſaid the man,
<q>for ſix years my EMMA you have ſuſtained the moſt bitter poverty with your unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate huſband. My heart breaks under the oppreſſion of your miſery; I cannot bear it —return I beſeech you, to the Baron; aſk his fatherly forgiveneſs; he will reinſtate you to favour—and lovely EMMA I ſhall die content.</q>—"I ſmile," replied the fair one,
<q>at your ignorance: gold and gems and banquets have no charms for me; my heart was formed for ſocial happineſs; I love you, and deprived of your company I ſhould languiſh and die, whereas I feel no uneaſineſs at the abſence of riches; we have enough to ſubſiſt comfortably on,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:025208_0108_0FCC8EDB284D42C0"/>
though it be coarſe; ſo pray, my dear, drop this unwelcome delicacy.</q>
Here they went out of hearing, and HENRY, ſtruck with the lady's ſentiments, began to reſume courage. "I am aſhamed," ſaid he,
<q>at my want of fortitude; here is voluntary po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty accepted in preference of an anxious mind: ſurely ANNE will have as much philoſophy in that article as the unfortunate EMMA: what a deſtruction have I eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! had I wandered away from my deſolate family, we had all been miſerable indeed.</q>
So thinking, he took his pack on his ſhoulders and proceeded or his journey.</p>
            <p>The fourth evening, paſſing leiſurely by his deceaſed parent's door, he involuntarily turned back and walked in. Here his feelings received a new ſhock. Strange faces accoſted him—rudeneſs and dirt had uſurped the place where ANNE once reigned the goddeſs of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility and neatneſs. The green incloſure, ſurrounded by jeſſamine, was trampled on by ſwine, and lean cattle browzed on the vines that mantled over ANNE's window. He turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with grief and diſguſt from this mortifying ſcene, and had gone but a little farther, when
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:025208_0109_0FCC8EDE182C04D0"/>
ANNE deſcrying him at a diſtance, flew like a bird acroſs the meadow, and fell into his arms. After the firſt emotions of tranſport were ſubſided, HENRY affectionately em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced his lovely babes and tender parents, who met him on the road.
<q>I miſs but one from this beloved company,</q>
ſaid HENRY. —ANNE burſt into tears.
<q>My HENRY, you will miſs the chief of our good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood—our indulgent old Lord is dead; his tyrannical heir oppreſſes his tenants with heavy rents and ſevere exactions, and they have unanimouſly agreed to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from this great burden, by flying to the wilds of <hi>America.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>After they were ſeated in the houſe,
<q>What your ſpouſe advances,</q>
ſaid the old man,
<q>is true; and your aged parents would have alſo been forced to venture their trembling limbs and grey hairs over the dangerous ocean, had not our bleſſed HENRY's induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſecured us a competency.</q>
This trial was too ſevere. HENRY changed counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and caſt his eyes around with an alarming wildneſs.

cried his mother. Alas!
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:025208_0110_0FCC8EF4E2BF8200"/>
this encounter was too ſudden.
<q>Old and experienced as I am, I feel almoſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with joy myſelf.</q>—"Ah!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed her ſon (recollecting himſelf)
<q>fain would I conceal from ſuch endearing friends the motive of my diſtreſs; but I ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire in the effort: forgive and pity a wretch who brings home nothing but miſery— who can ſee his family fall to ruin, and yet live.</q>—All aſtoniſhed they gazed at each other in ſilence, while HENRY ſobbed, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to articulate a word. At length ANNE, all ſhining through tears, drew nigh and kneeled before him—
<q>Keep us not in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, my huſband; pour your griefs into our boſoms, and wrong us not by reſerve; you can never bring miſery to us whilſt you remain virtuous and loving as now.</q>— HENRY claſped the ſad orator with paſſionate fondneſs in his arms; and after a little heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion acquainted them with the particulars of his misfortune.</p>
            <p>It was in vain to try to conceal their ſurpriſe and diſoppointment, though HENRY's afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion forbad them to fall into repining, or any expreſſion of diſcontent. By degrees their
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:025208_0111_0FCC8EF6C61EA298"/>
chagrin ſubſided. The poor acquieſce with greater reſignation to calamity than the rich, who ſeldomer meet with diſappointment. At laſt, by an inſenſible gradation, our penſive aſſociates became bleſt and eaſy. A ſmall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt was provided, and ſhutting out corroſive Care, they indulged the hour of feſtivity with as much glee as if the robbers had reſtored the money ten fold.</p>
            <p>The ſtory of HENRY's robbery was ſoon known, and his parents concluded that their Lord would ſhew ſome lenity to them; but finding him invariably cruel and oppreſſive, they began to attend to the flattering informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about the New World.—"At leaſt," ſaid ANNE,
<q>we ſhall go into a land of ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity—the artleſs ſavages ſubſiſt not by rapine and deceit: pride and hypocriſy and avarice are ſtrangers where luxury and titles are unknown.</q>—The old man diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented from this opinion.
<q>Wherever the print of human footſteps have appeared, there certainly, my child, all human vices follow, though often under different appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives; however, we muſt hazard this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture. As the Lepers ſaid at <hi>Samaria</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The enſuing week, as they were merrily chatting on the green before the door, a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den cloud overſpread the heavens with black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſoon fell in a torrent of rain, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingled with thunder and lightning. The family retired in the houſe; but HENRY haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to drive the cattle and ſheep to a place of ſecurity. All wet and dropping with rain he was returning to the houſe, when an elegant phaeton, attended by a number of domeſtics, ſtopped at the gate. A gentleman handed out a lady, who ſeemed much affrighted with the ſtorm, and conducted her, with a delicate ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, to the door. HENRY opened it wide, and bowing to the ground, deſired them to walk in, preſenting them each with a chair. The noble air, and rich dreſſes of the new gueſts, awed our humble ruſtics, who ſcarcely durſt lift up their eyes at them, until the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, ſaluting the lady, inquired how his fair EMMA did after her fright. HENRY then inſtantly recollecting the lady's countenance, with a modeſt apology for his boldneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted

added he,
<q>this lady is the very ſame lovely EMMA whoſe noble diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs made me bluſh at my want of fortitude, and in effect ſaved my family from ruin.</q>
Here EMMA, ſtarting up, ſeized his hand—

               <q>I am the only child of the preſent Baron of <hi>Schauffhouſen,</hi> who was particularly cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious that my education ſhould render me up an accompliſhed lady to the world. On my firſt introduction into the <hi>grande monde,</hi> I found myſelf encompaſſed by admirers, whoſe addreſſes I permitted from vanity; but advancing to my twentieth year, my father grew ſolicitous that I ſhould ſelect a huſband from the number. It was in vain to remonſtrate to him that my heart was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged. He inſiſted on my accepting a
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:025208_0114_0FCCA31606233290"/>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Seven months after this I became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my preſent huſband; and not doubting but that the Baron would accede to our union, I permitted the moſt violent love to ſteal into my boſom. I acquainted him in a dutiful and affectionate manner of my attachment, to which he made no reply; but turning from me with a ſtern look (to my ſurpriſe) ſhut his cloſet door full in my face.</q>
In ten minutes I received this note—</p>

               <q>I wept inceſſantly on the peruſal of this cruel billet. I wrote one to my lover, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to forget me; but before I could diſpatch it, my couſin CHARLOTTE enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the room in great confuſion.</q>
               <q>Begone, EMMA,</q>
ſaid ſhe,
<q>your father is exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated to a degree of madneſs. He bide me to give you this purſe of piſtoles, and commands you to quit the caſtle inſtantly.</q>
—"Alas!" ſaid I, ſinking on the floor,
<q>I ſacrifice my love to my duty. My dear couſin, tell my old parent I am no longer a rebel to his will.</q>
Here I wept bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
<q>but the cruel CHARLOTTE called out, Here, JOSEPH, if the chaiſe is ready, hand your young lady in. I am commiſſioned, dear EMMA, to wait on you to another lodging. The angry Baron is from home, and I forfeit his favour if I do not oblige you to ſubmit.</q>—I then roſe from my
<q>knees, and ſullenly giving my hand to her, ſaid faintly,
<q>I ſee, CHARLOTTE, you have ſupplanted me; your undermining arts have ruined me.</q>
She made no reply, and I ſuffered myſelf to be conducted to the chaiſe. In two hours we came to a neat farm-houſe. CHARLOTTE formally took leave of me, and I was ſhewn to a ſmall, clean apartment, where, in a fit of agonizing deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, I threw myſelf upon a little bed.
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:025208_0116_0FCCA318E924F580"/>
The woman of the houſe, coming in, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that CHARLOTTE had advanced the pay for my year's board at her houſe; and concluding I was ſome refractory child, gave me a long lecture on obedience to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents. I ſcarcely heard her.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>After a few days I wrote to my father. I begged the interceſſion of my relations, but in vain; CHARLOTTE had ſtopped up every avenue to mercy. Finding myſelf rejected totally, I at length yielded to the emotions of a ſoft paſſion, and accepted the hand of my preſent huſband. We lived happily during ſix years, when, being ſeized with a pleu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>iſy, my phyſician made a report of my danger and poverty to my father. We had a ſmall hut on the common. The Baron's coach drove up to the door. He ſtooped as he entered, and walked cautiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over the looſe uneven floor of my poor bed-room. I roſe up ſurpriſed to ſee him; and as I ſat leaning againſt a pillow, the old man, in a guſh of grief and remorſe, fell on my bed ſobbing and unable to ſpeak. My two little ones ſeeing me weep, came up with viſible concern. The eldeſt kiſſed
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:025208_0117_0FCCA31AA52074A0"/>
my hand and ſaid,
<q>Don't cry any more, mamma, Mrs. MORELY has ſent us bread and milk enough for two days.</q>
Here the Baron redoubled his ſighs and ſeemed nearly ſuffocated, when I feebly bent towards him. O my father! am I then forgiven?</q>
But
<q>what he replied I know not—I fainted on the pillow. To be ſhort, he took us all home. CHARLOTTE's indiſcretions drew the odium of the family on her, and a bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken lieutenant carried her off to <hi>England.</hi> My father became exceſſively fond of my ſpouſe and children, and we are now upon a viſit to an old aunt, who lays a dying, and to whom I am ſole heireſs. My friends,</q>
               <q>continued ſhe, <q>I ſee by your looks my hiſtory is not impertinent, and I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge myſelf yet indebted to HENRY for his obliging partiality to me.</q>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>ANNE, with pleaſed looks, immediately ſpread a table with a clean diaper cloth, and placed on it ſeveral earthen plates, filled with the moſt delicious fruits, ſome biſcuits, a plate with honey-combs, and a flaſk of wine; while HENRY, bowing low, thanked the lady for the honour ſhe had done him.
<q>I bleſs the Almighty,</q>
ſaid HENRY,
<q>for ſo ſignally
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:025208_0118_0FCCA31C6A402598"/>
rewarding virtue. I even rejoice that the Baron's cruelty gave your excellent qualities an opportunity to ſhine out ſo philoſophical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the teſt of poverty. Believe me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, the luſtre of many a ſoul lies hidden beneath the ſplendor of affluence, like the Grand Duke's gems in the green vault.</q>
The gentleman ſmiled—<q>And many a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental mind, my HENRY,</q>
ſaid he,
<q>is circumſcribed by poverty, and is of little utility to mankind beyond the limits of his own family. I heartily wiſh you, my friend, a fortune equal to your merit; in the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while accept this trifle,</q>
handing him a purſe with twenty piſtoles. HENRY, amid the higheſt confuſion of bluſhing gratitude, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the gift gracefully, and preſſed his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors to accept of his little regale. When they had eat, the ſun began to ſhine out with new luſtre after the rain, and EMMA propoſed to proceed on their journey. She took a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der leave of HENRY, and kiſſing ANNE, ſtept into the carriage, which inſtantly drove out of ſight.</p>
            <p>Soon after this agreeable interview, they prepared for their long voyage. The penſive

               </gap>tle to the Marquis's ſteward, they all embarked in a ſmall veſſel on the <hi>Rhine.</hi> After a tedious ſail down the river, they were taken aboard a ſhip bound for <hi>New-York,</hi> in <hi>America.</hi> A fair wind ſprung up; they ſoon loſt ſight of the Imperial ſhores, and found themſelves ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a horizon of waters. The poor cottagers viewed the uncommon ſcene with pleaſure, mixed with dread; but in a few days were accuſtomed to the proſpect, and great agitation of the veſſel. HENRY, to leſſen the expence, had conditioned to work out his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; but he could procure only very indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent accommodations for his family, the ſhip being ſo crouded. After a few weeks ſail ANNE's eldeſt ſon ſickened and died, and the mournful parents, with agonizing hearts, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the babe of their hopes, the darling of their boſoms, to the waves.
<q>There ſinks my child,</q>
cried ANNE, weeping,
<q>in the depth of the wild ocean: inſtead of ſlumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my arms, he is gone to be the food of ſea monſters.</q>
HENRY ſupported and comforted her.
<q>We have another, my beloved; let us not ſin away the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining

little one by fruitleſs repinings; our ſon is aſcended to his Creator; it is not him that welters in the deep: O! grieve not that he is taken from the evil to come; from evils which we ſhall yet ſorrow over! Wiſely and mercifully has Providence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned our ſufferings to our ſtrength, and given the lenient hand of Time power to mollify thoſe griefs he cannot cure.</q>
In a little ſpace ANNE's ſorrows ſunk into a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid ſerenity. She began to ſmile as uſual, and HENRY was happy.</p>
            <p>They had a tedious paſſage; but at length, one moonſhine night, the ſailors cried out, "land!" In a moment they all crouded upon deck: it was very calm, and near day: a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſouth breeze aroſe ſoon after, and by ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe they clearly diſtinguiſhed the little iſlands covered with verdure, and the white beach on the bold continent.

<q>Why, demme brother, theſe people can't underſtand your gibberiſh; they will ſet you in the ſtocks for a Jeſuit.</q>
They got on ſhore, and the ſailor procured for HENRY's little family a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent apartment in Beaver-ſtreet. HENRY ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his acknowledgments to the generous ſailor, for he really found he ſhould never have been able, in his uncouth broken language, to make the people underſtand him.</p>
            <p>Here HENRY left his little family while he went to ſeek a ſpot on the vacant lands of this ſtate, where he might accommodate them. He ſailed with a Dutch ſkipper to <hi>Albany,</hi> and being informed by him where he might find ſuch a place as he wiſhed for, he ſet off early the morning after his arrival on foot. As he walked along the clovery banks of the <hi>Hudſon,</hi> the long beams of the riſing ſun glanced over its crumpled ſurface, and gilt the oppoſite ſhores with peculiar beauty, the tall pines of the adjacent foreſt waved in ſolemn grandeur; the thruſh warbled in the thicket; and at every ſhort diſtance a little fountain caſt its ſilvery waves acroſs the way, and ſupplied the thirſty traveller with a ſeaſonable regale.

The tempeſt of my ſoul has again ſubſided: But, my dear, as you deſire to know how we are circumſtanced, in compliance with your requeſt, I muſt again wound your feelings with a lamentable ſtory: therefore, ſadden your countenance according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and I ſtipulate, that between every para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph you ſhall pauſe and make a moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection.</p>

ſtouteſt of us; but yeſterday they ſeized an old man, and propoſed the plundering of our houſe to him; he declined it, though a diſaffected perſon himſelf, and acquainted us with our danger; alſo, that the banditti were thirty in number. You may gueſs (but 'tis likely you will not) that our diſorder on this exceeded the confuſion of AGRAMONTA's camp: every thing topſey-turvy, every one hurrying to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete ſome little bundle in an unſuſpected va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy, and one dreadful apprehenſion expel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling another; for SUSAN and I ventured up in a loft without light, where ſpectres have been gamboling for at leaſt a dozen centuries—by report.</p>
               <p>We ſtill remain greatly alarmed, and never undreſs for bed. However, we have paſſed the preceding ſeaſon in ſecurity and pleaſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have frequently had ſociable dances, which by way of eminence we ſtile a ball. The moſt diſagreeable of our hours are when we admit politics in our female circle: this never fails of opening a field of nonſenſical contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy among our ladies.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>YOUR letter was more acceptable to me than the ſmiles of the returning ſpring after this long rigid winter; (and indeed your ſilence contributed to make it more tedious.) But I wonder what caprice of fortune intercepts all my epiſtles: ſurely ſhe owes you ſeveral volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous pacquets which I committed to her care. And ſince I am in a vein of wondering, I wonder how you could be ſo long ignorant of the place of our KITTY's reſidence: her ſtay with us was ſhort; the charming city tempted her away: but ſhortly after ſhe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grated to <hi>Halfmoon,</hi> five miles from here, where ſhe remains.</p>
               <p>As to myſelf, I have but little to inform you, unleſs it ſhould be the hiſtory of my heart, and even in that there is no novelty. I love the ſame perſons, the ſame amuſements, the ſame opinions I did ten years ago. But my affection is almoſt become a painful ſenſation to me; for, except my dear little family, all my friends are dead, or far, far abſent. This, the poet obſerves, is the perquiſite of long life: but my days have been evil and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>How ſhall I apologize, my couſin, for writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this ſtrain to a fair lady who would chuſe to hear of none but metaphorical deaths, and innocent murders cauſed by her eyes? I will exclude theſe heavy ideas, and be gay to pleaſe my ſprightly correſpondent.</p>
               <p>I believe Hymen likes a ſouthern clime: our northern blaſts would blow out his torch: but I hope he will return with the Zephyrs, to legitimate ſeveral premature children in our neighbourhood, which Love has produced in his abſence. I hear of but one marriage round here this winter. Our girls begin to tremble. I believe I muſt ſend the following advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to LOUDON:—</p>

               <p>Mr. POPE obſerves, that reſignation is the moſt melancholy of all the virtues; but we can combat Fate with no other weapon than Patience, and it is not ſo hard to effect as we are apt to imagine; the practice is eaſy and full of conſolation.

was torn (perhaps for ever) from my arms: he was taken by tories in ſight of his houſe. O! this cruel diſaſter has cruſhed me to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre: I am ſunk deeper than the grave. In the bitterneſs of my ſoul I forget to eat my bread, and mingle my drink with tears. Alas! the man I have loſt was too good, too kind; his qualities were ſo gentle and amiable; he loved me with too great an exceſs of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; with ſo much delicacy and ſoftneſs, as becomes very painful for me to recollect: And his affection ſeemed to increaſe every day: he was always endeavouring to pleaſe me; always anxious about my happineſs. If I looked but a little penſive, he was alarmed. It was but two nights ago that he waked me by putting his hand acroſs my forehead, and finding me in a cold clammy ſweat, he ſtarted up and got me a glaſs of wine. I was not ſenſible of any diſorder, but was ſurpriſed to find myſelf cold as a corpſe. I ſat up, while he, kneeling by the bed ſide, graſped my hand in an agony of concern and tenderneſs.

Towards evening, parting from his labourers, he was returning home with old MERKEE, a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But his great anguiſh for me made him inſenſible of ferr; he begged, in the moſt pathetic terms<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the negro might return to let me know what was become of him, but all in vain.

               <p>I AM wholly diſcouraged from writing any more to your quarter: our letters, I am ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, are loſt on the way, as I have not received a line from you or M— ſince early laſt fall. This interruption muſt certainly be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of an impertinent curioſity in ſome people, who break every ſeal they meet with, and then deſtroy the letters for fear of detection. If this ſhould fall into ſuch hands, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to the gentlemen (few ladies being capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſuch ungeneroſity) that ſuch a proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betrays a want of common honeſty and common humanity in them. A period is put to many tender friendſhips by thoſe imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, each party reſenting being neglected by the other.</p>
               <p>I hope, my dear, this mild winter preſents you with every elegant pleaſure. The army being in your vicinage, muſt certainly be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of entertainment.

I hear no more of K—; we have lately wrote to her, but cannot expect to receive from her ſuch gay communicative letters any more, as ſhe uſed to ſend us from <hi>R</hi>—. I hope ſhe finds it agreeable.</p>
               <p>I wonder you do not ſend off one of your beaus expreſs, with a packet to put me out of pain about you. This undertaking would have a double advantage; it would highly oblige me, and convince you of your adorer's ſincerity by his obedience. The beauties of antiquity always made trial of their lovers merits, by urging them on to prodigious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits; and I defy you to ſhew me a ſingle knight in hiſtory, enamoured of ſome beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful princeſs, who did not encounter fiery dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons,

painful; but bleſſed be God this cloud alſo paſſed over my head, and ſhe recovers finely after two relapſes.</p>
               <p>Would you believe it, my dear, we are again at <hi>Tomhanick,</hi> in my old apartment, agreeably ſituated in the neighbourhood of Mr. and Mrs. B—, who live in the weſt part of my houſe. <hi>Albany</hi> became inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me; I would rather have lived in ROLANDO's Cavern, than in that unſociable, illiterate, ſtupid town; I prefer ſolitude to ſuch company; but I miſs you, my ſiſter, in every part of this houſe; the hall, the little room, &amp;c. continually remind me of the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant hours we have paſſed together in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envied retirement. Will you not return be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpring? Ah! SUSAN, if you do not I ſhall begin the labours of our flower beds with a heavy hearts, your favourite lillies will droop; nor ſhall I have courage to diſengage your pinks from entangling weeds: endeavour, my dear, to come up; I am ſure we ſhall be happy together. I received your obliging preſent, for which I ſincerely thank you, and hope you enjoy all poſſible felicity in <hi>Jerſey,</hi> whoſe preſent gaity is ſuitable to your youth and

ſprightlineſs: as for my diſpoſition, depreſſed by calamities, worn out with ſorrows, the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſoftneſs of a rural life accords beſt with it.—</p>
               <p>Again I am left ſolitary: Mr. B— went this morning on an expedition againſt the ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate Vermonters, (or new claimants) with Col. R—, from the Manor, who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here laſt night with his regiment, and eat up all my ducks and ſauſages. The new claimants are collected at <hi>Sinchoick,</hi> and form a little army: they have miſerably mauled poor F— and R—, who keep their beds. Our ſmall force there increaſes daily, and begins to brow-beat the enemy: in ſhort, we are all anarchy and confuſion: heaven only knows when it will end.</p>
               <p>The moſt tragical affair has happened here that I ever remember to have heard of. JAMES YATES, (a ſon of him at <hi>Pitt's-Town,</hi>) a few nights ago murdered his wife, four children, his horſes and cow, with circumſtances of cruelty too horrid to mention: by all appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance he is a religious lunatic.</p>
               <p>Dear Suſan, how ſhall I conclude? when writing to you my pen inſenſibly draws me
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:025208_0161_0FCCA35A77FA1BD0"/>
beyond the common limits of a letter; but I know you will be fond of hearing every mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute particular reſpecting poor <hi>Tomhanick,</hi> where I flatter myſelf you have enjoyed ſome hours of pleaſure.</p>
               <p>Neighbour F— has had his ſhop burnt off yeſterday, together with his waggon, ſleigh, winter's proviſion, and many other articles.

Alas! alas! nothing but dry politics, and I am willing to ſpare you the mortification of them. Indeed, my ſweet girl, I am penning a long epiſtle; but St. PETER knows whether I ſhall ever find conveyance for it: however, I will continue to write on in diſcharge of my conſcience, and ſo good night; to-morrow I reſume my pen.—</p>

I ſat myſelf down among this formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſet, and being cold, mildly deſired one of their Captains to fetch a little dry wood.

I then began humbly to expoſtulate with theſe wiſe men of the eaſt about the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this civil war; and at length demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how they could expect to ſupport their ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, in the center of the ſtates, who had not acceded to their claim? They replied,
<q>The four eaſtern ſtates were their own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and would certainly aſſiſt them.</q>
I told them I could not ſee how they dared break through the confederacy while they were ſenſible all America's happineſs depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the union. Captain R— inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,

Would you believe it, I have been forced to parade in the line of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to defend our caſtle: however, the union was diſſolved, and the new claimants left to ſhift for themſelves; upon which they were apprehended by the Yorkers, and carried to <hi>Albany</hi> jail: among whom were M—, C—, T— and his two ſons, JOHN P—, W—, JOHN S—, and ſeveral others. The ſame evening I ſent a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

<pb n="157" facs="unknown:025208_0166_0FCC8EBD6ED01D98"/>
more are all fled with their families in a clan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtine manner. This elopement of the tories gives us new apprehenſions: we fear they will attempt in the ſpring a deſcent on this quarter; and though the ſea-coaſt is well defended, our poor frontiers are commonly forgotten.</p>
               <p>We have not ſeen the lads this winter. M— P— was here yeſterday with A— L—; they have ſtolen a wedding. L— S— and the Major have likewiſe conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their long courtſhip. J— H— is going to die, and old F— ſends his reſpects to you.</p>
               <p>Miſs T— E—, you have all the news, but I muſt add one trifle more:—Your admirer R— is no warrior; not all the eloquence of our <hi>York</hi> party could induce him to face the enemy: but his ſituation admits of ſome apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy: depreſſed with the loſs of you, perhaps he is become indifferent about character, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I ſhould not have mentioned this laſt morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying article, but in a late packet I received a hint as if Mr. R— was ſupplanted in your eſteem by ſome <hi>R— petit maitre.</hi> Beware of adding to your murders.

               <p>THIS day (the anniverſary of an event ſadly important to me) awakes me from a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception I have admitted ſince our ſeparation. I have been loſing relations, friends, children and acquaintances many years: but with the laſt farewell ſalute you gave me, in the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of grief I reproached Providence it had not left me one friend: I retired hither, with my very little family, mourning, and could not help repeating the words of HEZEKIAH, "I ſhall go ſoftly all my days."—Your letters, PEGGY's and MARIA's I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, often read, and wept over; but, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that my gloomy ideas would be unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:025208_0169_0FCCA3632B66A050"/>
in the circle of pleaſure, I omitted anſwering as much as poſſible.</p>
               <p>But this day tells me I have yet a kind com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, who might now have lain fettered in a dungeon, had not Providence interpoſed. I have an endearing child, who might have now lain in the dark grave, if the ſame mercy had not reſtored her. And in ſpite of habit, gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude ſhall make me this day cheerful.</p>
               <p>Dear SUSAN, you muſt peruſe the above <hi>alone:</hi> the genuine ſentiments of a broken heart appear ridiculous to inexperienced levity: and though your fai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

terror to every one that ſees it. It ſeems ſhe was ſtruck with ſo much horror at the ſight of JAMES YATES's murdered family, that it made too fatal an impreſſion.</p>
               <p>I had almoſt forgot to mention, that ſimple BETT HERMAN is married to a Heſſian: Mr. B. officiated as prieſt, and I gave the happy couple a wedding-dinner, to which we invited our moſt civilized neighbours. E. and G. lodge here alternately, to guard Mr. B. and beg their regards may be preſented you.</p>
               <p>To return to myſelf—an unimportant and almoſt forgotten ſubject—I have been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed during the winter and ſpring in attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my health, which has been conſiderably impaired and weather-beaten by the ſtorms of affliction.

Forgive my relapſing into melancholy: I will make one more exertion to be lively, and if I cannot ſucceed, will conclude my paper.</p>
               <p>I have the fineſt garden in the country. In the center of four graſs walks we have erected
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:025208_0171_0FCCA366587A6738"/>
a ſpacious arbour, cloſely ſhaded with annual vines, where we often drink tea, and enjoy the proſpect of a lovely collection of flowers on one hand, and a cool ſhady orchard on the other; a luxuriant lot of herbage behind, and directly oppoſite a bluſhing vineyard in minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Here, often, when peruſing THEOCRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUS, TASSO, and VIRGIL, I drop thoſe paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral enthuſiaſts, to reflect on the hours of friendſhip I have paſſed with my SUSAN: my cheek then glows with delight, pleaſure deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cately touches my nerves, and all the ſprings of life mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Do you never hear of SAMMY? does he not write to you? Though I dwell in the depth of a vaſt foreſt, that need not limit his love: the ſtill voice of affection cannot be loſt in the thunder of war. What can be the reaſon he forgets me? I muſt either entertain a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of my own demerits, or this—but love and partiality forbid a deciſion.</p>
               <p>After all, my SUSAN, I will endeavour to circumſcribe my happineſs to the little lovely

ſpot I occupy, and try to forget the friends whoſe abſence is ſo painful to me. O! could I think (like the inhabitants of <hi>Topinamboo</hi>) that the mountains which ſurround me were the limits of the earth, and that the individual ſpot I dwelt on was the whole world, I might then truly enjoy the pleaſures it produced.</p>
               <p>What ails the lads in your quarter? They muſt be very inſenſible, or you three fair nymphs very cruel, or Hymen ſurely would light his taper at <hi>R</hi>—. If this vein of celibacy continues, I would adviſe to erect a cloiſter, and then your nominal Lady Abbeſs would have ſomething to do; the Miſs W.'s would be large contributors, as they have taken the veil thirty years ago.

               <p>YOUR black eyes ſeem to have done ſome execution already; but you, more cruel than the Princeſs of the Steel Caſtle, who pitied the Knight of the Burning Peſtle, have diſcarded your STREPHON without a ſigh. But if you continue invincible to love fifty years hence, when your black eyes begin to twinkle through
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:025208_0174_0FCCA36AC26B2400"/>
"a pair of green ſpectacles, with ſilver rima and a ſhagreen caſe," you may poſſibly repent.</p>
               <p>Dear SUSAN, you will eaſily diſtinguiſh this raillery from the undiſguiſed ſentiments of my heart: your letter made me feel that I am indeed your ſiſter: I love you, my SUSAN; and ſince your departure there is a chaſm in my family, at my table, at my fire-ſide, that is not filled to my liking by any other; but ſo far I am happy, that you are in a family where, with proper attention, you will gain every uſeful, every ornamental accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Now let me tell you the news of theſe parts. NANNY BOSTWICK died lately of a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I went to ſee the little beauty in her laſt moments; her piety, reſignation and fortitude were very ſtriking: ſhe ſmiled diſapprobation when, to conſole her, I hinted ſhe might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. Mrs. P— too lays very ill. Papa, who was here yeſterday, told me ſhe could not recover to all human appearance: I ſhall viſit her to-morrow, and if this paper is not ſealed, will let you know her true ſituation.—I hear Doctor BROWN is dead in <hi>Virginia</hi>; that H— is very much reduced; and that W— has
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:025208_0175_0FCCA36C2911E698"/>
made a great fortune in <hi>New-England</hi> by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateering, and improved it by a wealthy mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. Undoubtedly he omits his uſual queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "What do the ladies ſay of me?"— Bleſs me, I could fill a volume. S— C— has accidentally bleſt <hi>Vermont</hi> with a fatherleſs ſon, and is gone to <hi>Canada.</hi> We are all well, except JOHNNY. Domine B. dreſſes like a very beau. JAMES H— and MAG S— traverſe the buſhes on horſeback; and MER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>KEE thanks you kindly for recollecting him; but FAN reſents your neglect, and begs me to let you know that ſhe thinks you loſe your manners. I ſuppoſe you know that MOLLY P— is married: yes, I recollect I formerly wrote it to you.</p>
               <p>All this nonſenſe, my ſweet SUSAN, will remind you of the many laughing, indolent hours we have paſſed, in the cool of ſummer evenings, on our green, where we chatted without reſerve or impertinent caution, and as the full moon roſe bright in a cloudleſs ſky, when the ſimple lads and laſſes were convened, we ſported in the innocency of childiſh amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and pleaſed and fatigued with blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's-buff,
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:025208_0176_0FCCA36DDFADAA38"/>
and hide-and-ſeek, and puſs-in-the-corner, we went ſweetly to reſt.</p>
               <p>SUSAN, all this little chat is for your own inſpection. Were you to ſhew this letter to ſome belle or fop, you would be the leſs eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for converſing with ſuch a very ruſtic, ſuch a ſtranger to the etiquette of a polite circle. The well-bred hate ſimplicity: there is a great gulph between the vulgar adepts of nature, and the artificial, mechanical ſons of cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>To-day is my birth-day: I have made it a day of thankſgiving to my God, who has often brought my ſoul out of trouble, and have made it ſacred to the memory of my beſt loved friends, by writing them ſeverally long letters. External rejoicing and feſtivity I care not for: the ſecret approbation of my conſcience is all the praiſe I now ſeek after, and more, in my eſteem, to be valued, than the acclamations of an empire.</p>
               <p>How ſhall I conclude this incoherent epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle? When I begin to talk to my SUE, (for, as Mr. POPE ſays, this is not writing) I know not how to be ſilent.</p>

               <p>We have had an agreeable jaunt to <hi>New-England,</hi> but in paſſing the mountains of <hi>Tawkanok</hi> I think I never ſaw a more lovely ſcene: we had aſcended the laſt declivity; the vallies below us, interſperſed with farms, and plains, and villages, ſeemed to be at an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible depth; when we entered on a level, overſhaded with evergreens, laurel, and hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,

pine and ſpruce, intermixed with red, blue and yellow berries—imitating the ſofteſt bowers of ſummer. Theſe greens naturally ſtruck out into long viſtas, through which we ſaw the gildings of the ſetting ſun long after the mortals below us were ſunk in darkneſs.</p>
               <p>We found the people hoſpitable and ſocial; were invited cheerfully into almoſt every genteel houſe we chanced to paſs; and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed home, like JACOB's ſons from <hi>Egypt,</hi> with our money, if not in our ſack's mouth, at leaſt in our pockets: but tell SUSAN we left little BENJAMIN behind, who is preceeding to the <hi>Nine-Partners.</hi>

               <p>I begin to find the winter tedious; my circle of friends here is too ſmall; that of my ruſtic acquaintance too large: when the heart is not intereſted, the mind has little ſatisfaction in company: your own feelings will confirm my obſervation. Dear cuz, can't you contrive to viſit us?

of a ſoul whoſe feelings are too acute: the diſtant idea of an interview with thoſe whom I love elevates me beyond reaſon, and ten times a day I anticipate our happy meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>I received yeſterday a long letter from Mr. A—: he tells me our KITTY is <hi>increaſing:</hi> poſſibly I may incloſe a letter for him: I wiſh ſhe would write; ſhe can (if ſhe will) chat very agreeably.

               <p>NO, I can admit of no excuſe, I have written three letters in folio to my SUSAN, and have received no anſwer. After various conjectures about the cauſe of ſo mortifying an omiſſion, I have come to this concluſion, that you have commenced a very, very faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lady—(you ſee my penetration)—and though I am not in poſſeſſion of JOSEPH's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vining cup, I can minutely deſcribe how you paſſed the day when my laſt letter was handed you; we will ſuppoſe it your own journal.</p>

Mr. S. and I were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled through the interceſſion of P—, whoſe lovely humanity every where com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands eſteem. We paſſed the hours very agreeably. On my retiring DINAH attended, and having no paper handy, I gave her ſiſter's letter to put my hair in buckle, while I read theſe verſes, which Colonel TINSEL, with a ſigh, gave me:—

               <p>Mr. B— begs me, at this very inſtant, to preſent his very humble regards to you, and has made three ſolemn bows to your ladyſhip before I could write a ſentence. POLLY S— is here, and making ſad execution among our beaus. We live here a merry kind of a laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, indolent life: we ſuffer no real evils, and are far from regretting the elegant amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which attend a city life: all that I want, my ſiſter, is your company. This conſtant repetition you muſt permit (without repining) in all my letters. I never walk in that angle of my garden where your flowers are planted, but I heave a ſigh, as if it were a painted monument to your departed body. Can you never come to us? Were it not for my precarious health, I might even adventure to <hi>R</hi>—, and kiſs couſin B—, as my old dear friend, whom I tenderly love, though ſhe forgets me: but I am often ſick; and happy am I that my JACK is ſo good a nurſe; the tenderneſs of his nature and cheerfulneſs of his temper, contribute more to my cure than all the reſtoratives in the diſpenſatory.</p>

                  <p>This day fourteen years ago, SUSAN, I was married; repent, and take a huſband.</p>

               <head>To Mr. <hi>S***** S</hi>*******.</head>
               <p>I Congratulate you, my dear brother, on the peace; in conſequence of which I ſincerely hope you may ſee many happy years: as for me, my bright proſpects lie beyond the grave; I have little to promiſe myſelf on this ſide of eternity. Affliction has broken my ſpirit and conſtitution; I grow daily weaker and more emaciated, and depreſſed with the reflection of leaving my huſband and child—alas! the only treaſures I have now on earth.</p>
               <p>Let me talk freely to you for the laſt time, my brother:—You know your poor BETSEY was born a ſolitary orphan: though enjoying a genteel fortune, yet friendleſs, and a wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:025208_0187_0FCCA37E2CC65378"/>
at length I found peace in the company of a tender huſband. Ah, how ſoon interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! my lovely babes died away like ſummer bloſſoms before the froſt: ſtill I had a kind mother to complain to; we wept together: but ſoon the enemy ruſhing upon us like a hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane, we were ſcattered like a flock of frighted birds: our dear mother fled to <hi>Red-Hook</hi> with SUSAN; I ſtaid awhile at the farm; but a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den incurſion of ſome ſavages haſtened my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; I took my beautiful ABELLA on my arm, and PEGGY by the hand, and wandered ſolitary through the dark woods, expecting every moment to meet the bloody ally of <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain:</hi> however, we arrived ſafe at <hi>Arabia,</hi> where I met my huſband, who had been to <hi>Albany</hi>; he procured a chaiſe, and took us to the city; the alarm increaſing, we got a paſſage in a ſloop with ſiſter SWITS and family; twelve miles below <hi>Albany</hi> my ABELLA died of a dyſentery; we went aſhore, had one of my mahogany dining-tables cut up to make her coffin, and buried the little angel on the bank. I was ſeized with the diſtemper; and when we came to <hi>Red-Hook,</hi> found my dear mamma waſted to a ſhadow: ſhe mourned over the ruins of her
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:025208_0188_0FCCA37FF9348FD0"/>
family, and carried me to uncle H—'s, who received us very reluctantly. Soon after my dear mother died, and I returned to <hi>Albany,</hi> where, in a few days, I ſaw poor ſiſter CATY<note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs. SWITS.</note> expire. We retired again to <hi>Tomhanick,</hi> where we lived ſometime bleſt in domeſtic tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though under perpetual alarms from the ſavages: at length, one afternoon, a ſmall party from <hi>Canada,</hi> who had unperceivedly pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated the country, carried off Mr. BLEECKER with his two ſervants. This ſhock I could not ſupport. My little PEGGY and I went to <hi>Albany,</hi> where we wept inceſſantly for five days, when God was pleaſed to reſtore him to our arms. Soon after I fell into premature labour, and was delivered of a dead child. Since that I have been declining; and though we often fled from the enemy ſince, been cruelly plundered, and often ſuffered for very neceſſaries, yet your ſilence, my brother, hurts me more than theſe.</p>
               <p>Mr. BLEECKER talks of taking me to <hi>New-York</hi> this ſpring, but I believe I ſhall never reach it; my health is ſo precarious that I dare not, even here, venture an afternoon's viſit. I
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:025208_0189_0FCCA3812BFD98C0"/>
could wiſh to ſee you before I died; but I am uſed to diſappointments. I have given you my little hiſtory that you may ſee I die of a broken heart. Farewell, my only brother; may God preſerve your family, and continue all your bleſſings. When you ſee my poor little PEGGY, and my poor little HANNAH SWITS, think of your friends who have periſhed before you, and love and pity them for their ſakes. Give my kindeſt love to BETSEY, and accept of your brother's. I am, dear SAMMY, your very af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate ſiſter,</p>

SAMMY too has helped to embitter my cup of life; he has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted his affection within the orb of his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle family, and cannot ſhoot out a ray of love at this diſtance, to enlighten and bleſs a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn ſiſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I love him ſincerely; may he and his be forever happy.

Let me drop into news again—POLLY P— (Mrs. L.) has a fine ſon; and I had like to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got to mention that <hi>Vermont</hi> intends again to renew the eaſt and weſtern claims. Upon a late reſolve of Congreſs, (handed particularly to them) they have aſſumed an inſulting arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance of behaviour, threaten Congreſs, and
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:025208_0192_0FCCA3861EC2D8F0"/>
imprecate <hi>New-York.</hi> In ſhort. I fancy we ſhall have all our perſecutions to go over again.</p>
               <p>But what have your black eyes been doing all this while? have you captured no heart worth retaining?

               <p>We have here a ruſtic beauty come into our foreſt, that would be much admired (I mean for perſon, not manners) by all the beaus of <hi>R—:</hi> the ſymmetry of her form, glitter of her eyes, and leſſening ſhades of vermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion on her cheek, which loſe themſelves im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceptibly in a complexion of the moſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate whiteneſs; theſe, when improved in the <hi>beau monde</hi> by artificial graces, would make her an irreſiſtible toaſt; ſhe has the romantic name of MELANESSA; but being of a tender conſtitution, not able to work, has no declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed admirer.</p>

               <p>I HAVE often wondered that amongſt the numbers who write for the edification of the public, no one has ever thought fit to expatiate upon the <hi>Benefits of Scolding</hi>; nor can I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive why an art, whoſe origin we may trace in years before the flood, and which is ſo much in uſe among the moderns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould be diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by writers.</p>
               <p>It is an ancient art, and I am perſuaded a very beneficial one, not only to individuals, ſuch as huſbands, wives, children, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, but to the community at large. Schools, in particular, are much indebted to it; and though they may not acknowledge it, nor think it merits an eulogy from their pens, yet the flouriſhing ſtate of many of our ſeminaries ſpeaks loudly in its favour. People in general would rather ſuffer corporeal puniſhment than
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:025208_0274_0FCCA3F57621C9C0"/>
be lectured upon their faults; and I have known many who did not mind the rod to be deterred from a continuance of their follies, merely by the laſhes of the tongue.</p>
               <p>A ſcolding officer has often made his ſubal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns as angry as hornets in an engagement; and a coward, when enraged, will fight moſt courageouſly. Perhaps he might have called them cowards in his ill-humour, and they, out of ſpite, have exerted themſelves and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed wonders, which, had their leader been a tame, peaceable creature, they would have looked upon as impracticable: and we know an able politician, when a motion was made in the houſe of which he was a member, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the ſtate which he lived in, who not only ſcolded the houſe out of countenance, but out of the motion too, and made them lay it by for years.</p>
               <p>The ſpouſe of SOCRATES was of a turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent temper, which made his friends pity him much; but SOCRATES was a wiſe man, and well knowing the utility of ſcolding, told them, that ſhe taught him patiently to put up with the humours of other men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="267" facs="unknown:025208_0275_0FCCA3F6F440E078"/>Scolding is not only good for the mind but the body too. It makes reſpiration more free, and cures colds; and by promoting perſpiration, has been known to remove complaints of long ſtanding. Let the following account ſpeak for it:—</p>
               <p>A lady of my acquaintance was in a very ill ſtate of health ſome time ago, as every body thought in a conſumption; but one day (as the Doctors were ſitting by her) luckily ſomething went wrong, and the poor invalid forgetting her reduced ſituation, gave vent to her feelings, and ſcolded moſt eloquently, and diſplayed her talents in ſuch a manner as rectified the miſtake, brought on a profuſe perſpiration, and greatly relieved her. The benefits ariſing from ſuch proceedings were more than ſhe could have expected; ſhe, however, repeated it with the ſame ſucceſs, and is now a hearty woman.</p>
               <p>But ſome may be apt to inquire, "If this is true, might not people live for ever were they to keep on ſcolding?" No one, I believe, has ever yet made the experiment, nor ſhould I dare wiſh to propagate ſuch an opinion; but this I know, that almoſt all ſcolds live to be

pretty old, nor do I remember ever to have heard of a perſon who died ſcolding.</p>
               <p>My ſcolding abilities are at preſent very ſlender, but there is room for improvement; and it is probable, if I ſhould make any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable proficiency in that ſcience, I may favour the public with a ſpecimen.</p>

               <p>NOTWITHSTANDING what the learned Mr. JEFFERSON has ſaid reſpecting the want of finer feelings in the blacks, I cannot help thinking that their ſenſations, mental and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, are as acute as thoſe of the people whoſe ſkin may be of a different colour; ſuch an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion may ſeem bold, but facts are ſtubborn things, and had I not <hi>them</hi> to ſupport me, it is probable I ſhould not attempt to oppoſe the opinions of ſuch an eminent reaſoner.</p>

Upon the commiſſion of the ſmalleſt fault, on the moſt trifling neglect, he would himſelf tie MINGO, (as butchers do ſheep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for ſlaughter) and after having beaten him till the blood followed every ſtroke of the whip, he would retire, leaving the wretch weltering in his gore, expoſed to the burning rays of ſummer or the gelid gales of winter. When reſted he would return, and after a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of his amuſement, would releaſe the ſufferer, leſt a few more minutes of ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme agonies ſhould ſhorten the period of MINGO's woes, and his maſter's felicity. However, this mode of puniſhment becoming a little troubleſome to Mr. A—, he thought
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:025208_0278_0FCCA3FC2F8E29F0"/>
of another which he believed would anſwer nearly as well: he cauſed a large ox-chain to be made, and putting it about MINGO's waiſt, he brought it round his neck, and there faſtened it again, leaving an end of about four yards, to which he nailed a piece of wood weighing upwards of forty weight. With this clog the ſlave was obliged to work—and this at night was placed in the maſter's chamber, (the chain paſſing through a hole in the door) while MINGO ſlept on the ground out ſide of the houſe, from which uncomfortable couch no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the moſt bitter cold excuſed him.</p>
               <p>Seven long years did the miſerable being groan under this load, when the captain of a veſſel, hearing of his hard fate, out of pity bought him.</p>
               <p>After having paid the money he went home, and ſending for MINGO, told him he was free:—"You are your own maſter," ſaid the humane ſailor;
<q>but you are old, and help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs—I will take care of you.</q>—Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered with joy, the old man claſped the captain's knees; he wept aloud—he raiſed his ſwimming eyes to heaven—he would have ſpoken his thanks;—but his frame was too feeble for the mighty conflict of his ſoul—he expired at his benefactor's feet!</p>
