            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHEN the ſorrowful Tidings concerning the Death of his Royal Highneſs, THE PRINCE, reached us, and cauſed the Hearts of this moſt loyal People to contract and their Faces to gather a melancholy Gloom; Theſe Words of the holy and learned Apoſtle came into my own penſive Mind, and engag'd for a Seaſon my own retired Sentiments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:006716_0005_1029AD78C9E883A8"/>
There was not at that Time a ſingle Tho't in my Heart, that it would fall to my Lot to perform ſuch a mournful Office for the ROYAL SON, as I was once called to undertake for his ROYAL MOTHER, the late gracious Queen CAROLINE; whoſe Name yet lives eſteemed, whoſe exalted Vertues are yet had in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, whoſe diſtinguiſhed Merit is yet gratefully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and owned, and whoſe <hi>Memory</hi> is yet, and will continue to be, <hi>bleſſed</hi> among us.</p>
            <p>But, when I perceived it to be the Appointment of his Honour, <hi>The Commander in Chief, and the Honorable His Majeſty's Council</hi> for the Province, that the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Part of the Funeral Obſequies of this Day ſhould be committed to the Truſt of <hi>one,</hi> who is ſo unmeet for it, and in all Reſpects ſo unequal to it; and that, as I ſuppoſe, becauſe it fell in Courſe to me this Week to preach publickly; then from a Senſe of Duty I ſubmitted to their Appointment, acquieſced in their Pleaſure and reſolved in the Divine Strength to endeavor a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with their Order and Expectation.</p>
            <p>And then, The inſpired Paſſage, which has been read unto us, recurred again immediately to my Mind: And, as I apprehend, that a ſuitable Diſcourſe from it muſt be ſeaſonable on the preſent Occaſion; <hi>This</hi> is the very Thing to be now endeavored.</p>
            <p>THE immediate Occaſion of the Words before us was the foregoing Argument of the Apoſtle concerning the Rejection of the <hi>Jews</hi> for their Infidelity and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the Reception of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into the Church of the living GOD; which was <hi>a Myſtery hidden for many Ages and Generations</hi> before the Time of the great A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> There were indeed Predictions and Prophecies of theſe Things in the Writings of the old Teſtament; which either were not underſtood, or if underſtood were not believed, by the <hi>Jews.</hi> But it was given by Inſpiration to the holy PAUL to underſtand theſe ancient Predictions and Prophecies, and to confirm them in a ſure and inconteſtible Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:006716_0006_1029AD7C73BE9CD0"/>
And when our Apoſtle, towards the Cloſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding Chapter, and throughout <hi>This</hi> before us, had written clearly concerning the Calling of the <hi>Jews</hi> at firſt, and afterwards of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and aſſigned the <hi>Original Cauſe</hi> thereof, even the Goodneſs and Mercy of GOD; He then draws to a Concluſion of his whole Argument, exclaiming as in the Text, <hi>O the Depth of the Riches of the Wiſdom and Knowlege of GOD! How unſearchable are His Judgments, and His Ways paſt finding out!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which Expreſſions his devout and holy Soul ſeems to be rapt up in Wonder and Amazement; or rather, according to the Figure in the Text, to be <hi>plung'd,</hi> ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up and overwhelm'd with Admiration and Aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. <hi>O the Depth,</hi> cries He! Like one in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable Abyſs, that can find no Bottom. And what is it, which is ſo very deep? It follows here, <hi>O the Depth of the Riches both of the Wiſdom and Knowledge of GOD!</hi> q. d. O how profound, and of what vaſt, as well as deep, Abundance are the <hi>Treaſures of Divine Wiſdom and Knowledge!</hi> As the Divine Majeſty perfectly <hi>knows</hi> whatſoever comes to paſs in the World; ſo in his <hi>Wiſdom</hi> He ſuperintends, diſpoſes and governs in all, but indeed in ſuch a Way, and after ſuch a Sort, as w<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to the humane Race truly wondrous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comprehenſible: For—<hi>How Unſearchable are his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and his Ways paſt finding out!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe</hi> then are the Inſtances, which the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces, wherein <hi>the unſearchable Riches of Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowlege</hi> are diſplayed, namely, <hi>in the Divine Judgments and Ways.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>the Judgments of GOD;</hi> or, as the Greek runs, TA KPIMATA, we are to underſtand <hi>his Decrees,</hi> ſays the learned <hi>Grotius:</hi> And ſo we may take it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Counſels and Purpoſes of the Divine Mind with regard to <hi>Nations,</hi> as well as particular Perſons: Which, tho' ſome imagine, that <hi>they</hi> can clearly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them, and hence arrogantly venture on minutely explaining them; yet they are certainly <hi>deep</hi> Things, and by the Sons of Men unſearchable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:006716_0007_1029AD7DFA3D7838"/>
And, by <hi>the Ways of GOD,</hi> we are to underſtand <hi>the Footſteps and Paſſages of his Providence</hi> in the moral Government of the World. <hi>Theſe</hi> are <hi>His Ways, which are paſt finding out.</hi> The Greek Word here, which we render <hi>paſt finding out,</hi> properly ſignifies <hi>not to be traced,</hi> or by no diſtinct Marks and perfect Characters to be found. And ſome of the more critical Interpreters ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint us, that the Term is metaphorical, and taken from ſharp-ſighted and quick-ſcented Hounds, who are apt to ſtop and pauſe and ſhew themſelves at a Loſs, when they have neither Scent nor Track of the Game which they have been purſuing. And thus it is with regard to the Children of Men: For however earneſt, ſharp and eager we may be to find out the Ways of the ALMIGHTY, yet <hi>we cannot trace them.</hi>—Indeed we may ſoon perceive enough concerning them to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy us, that in all His Ways, in all the Footſteps of His Providence, He proceeds as becometh Him; and as He has infinite Reaſon for all his Conduct towards Mankind; ſo <hi>He is Righteous in all His Ways and holy in all His Doings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But altho' <hi>all the Divine Ways,</hi> as well as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Counſels and Purpoſes, be the Reſult of perfect Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and unerring Reaſon; yet many are the Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects and Inſtances, wherein we cannot trace the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Conduct, nor find out the Grounds and Reaſons of the Divine Diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>And now the important Truth before us is, That <hi>in the Ways of GOD,</hi> or Paſſages of His Providence, <hi>there is ſuch a Depth of Divine Wiſdom and Knowledge as is not to be traced and inveſtigated by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, in order to illuſtrate and confirm this Truth, ſo as that by the Bleſſing of GOD it may be firmly eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in your Minds; our <hi>firſt</hi> Attempt ſhall be to ſet before you <hi>ſome of thoſe Ways of GOD, which are not to be traced and inveſtigated by us:</hi> And the <hi>next</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:006716_0008_1029AD8141AFF608"/>
ſhall be to make it evident, that <hi>ſuch is the Divine Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowlege</hi> in theſe Ways <hi>as is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> theſe Things, we ſhall then endeavour to produce ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections upon the whole as may be fit and natural and uſeful to us.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place then, we ſhall endeavour to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you <hi>thoſe Ways of GOD, which are not to be traced and inveſtigated by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here it muſt be proper for us to begin with men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning <hi>thoſe Ways of GOD in calling and rejecting the</hi> Jews, <hi>and afterwards receiving the</hi> Gentiles <hi>to be His People.</hi> For <hi>Theſe</hi> are the Ways of GOD, <hi>Theſe</hi> the Paſſages of His Providence, to which our Text has an undoubted and ſpecial Reference.</p>
            <p>Why then, Sirs, was GOD pleaſed to call the Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ke them near unto Himſelf, to <hi>know them above all the Families of the Earth</hi> beſides, and to confer ſignal Advantages and Glories on them?—Was it becauſe they were ſuch a numerous Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſo powerful a Nation? No verily! For they were <hi>the feweſt of all People.</hi> And, at their greateſt Attainments of Wealth, Power and Grandeur, They were not equal to many other Kingdoms in Subſtance, Strength and Extent of Dominion.—Was it then on the Account of their <hi>ſu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>ior Piety, and ſurpaſſing Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that they were ſo diſtinguiſhed and honored of Heaven? No ſurely! For they were an impious and unjuſt Race; they were <hi>a diſobedient and gain-ſaying People all the Day long,</hi> even almoſt from the Time of their becoming the People of GOD to the very Time of their ceaſing to be ſo. And hence, after They had been <hi>His peculiar People,</hi> and even <hi>His only People,</hi> for the Space of above <hi>fifteen hundred</hi> Years; He then, for their obſtinate and incurable Infidelity and Wickedneſs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them.—This is a moſt remarkable Event, which was predicted in <hi>the Law and the Prophets:</hi> And GOD
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006716_0009_1029AD82C33380F8"/>
in His governing Providence has bro't it to paſs accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>And now the righteous and good Governor of the World has received the <hi>Gentiles</hi> into His Church, and taken them to Himſelf <hi>for a peculiar People.</hi> But why? <hi>This</hi> at the firſt was ſo wondrous and amazing a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the <hi>chriſtianized Jews,</hi> that they could hardly believe it. And indeed it was ſo ſtrange and incredible a Diſpenſation, that they knew not how to account for it, nor cared they to admit it, tho' conſcious to the Certainty of the Fact.—But however it was in the cleareſt Manner reveled to our Apoſtle PAUL; and he faithfully publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it in the <hi>third</hi> Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> as well as in the Chapter before us.</p>
            <p>And <hi>what now has been the Iſſue and Conſequence of theſe</hi> unſearchable Ways of GOD, in rejecting the <hi>Jews</hi> and receiving the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as His People? Alas! The <hi>Former</hi> have continued in their Infidelity and Rebellion ever ſince; and ſo under the Diſpleaſure of GOD, and their Rejection from Him for conſiderably above <hi>ſixteen hundred Years.</hi> And, whether They will ever again be own'd as the People of GOD, and received into his ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Favor and Protection; <hi>This</hi> is a Point, about which very learned and pious Men have a Diverſity of Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. But, as we have no Inclination at preſent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Controverſy, we ſhall therefore leave it.</p>
            <p>Here then <hi>let theſe Ways of GOD,</hi> tho' <hi>unſearchable, yet be duly heeded</hi> by us. Let us <hi>behold the righteous Severity, and wondrous Goodneſs of our GOD: On them, which fell, Severity; but towards the Gentiles Goodneſs, if They continue in His Goodneſs:</hi> Otherwiſe what ſhould hinder but that <hi>They ſhould be cut off alſo,</hi> if they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in their Infidelity and Wickedneſs?</p>
            <p>But, having thus noted <hi>the ſpecial Ways of GOD, to which our Text has a peculiar Reference;</hi> we may now, as I humbly conceive, very fairly and without any Room for juſt Exception, ſpeak of ſome other <hi>Ways of GOD, which are not to be traced and ſearched out by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006716_0010_1029AD84495897E8"/>
Thus, <hi>The Ways of GOD are paſt finding out, when He ſometimes accompliſhes his moſt holy Counſels and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes by ſuch Means, and in ſuch Ways and Manners, as are improbable, and in humans Apprehenſions altogether unlikely. The Divine Ways</hi> in this Regard are <hi>not as the Ways of Men:</hi> But, <hi>as the Heavens are high above the Earth,</hi> ſo are <hi>the Ways of GOD higher than our Ways,</hi> as well as <hi>his Tho'ts above our Tho'ts.</hi> In Purſuance of his moſt holy Counſels, He, by ſuch Ways and Means as appear to Men improbable, and even in their Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion impoſſible, ſometimes effects Things, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Events in the World.</p>
            <p>As for Inſtance here: <hi>It pleaſes the ſupreme Ruler of the World and Head of the Church to make the Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of his and his People's Enemies the Occaſion of their Ruin. O the Depth</hi> of this Counſel! And <hi>how unſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chable are theſe Divine Ways!</hi> It ſurely becomes us to admire at them; and with admiring Tho'ts, and adoring Language, to ſay with regard to them; <hi>O LORD GOD, How great are thy Works! Thy Tho'ts are very deep. A bruitiſh Man knoweth not; neither doth a Fool under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand This: When the Wicked ſpring as the Graſs, and when all the Workers of Iniquity do flouriſh; it is that they ſhall be deſtroyed forever. But it is good for me to draw near to Thee; and I have put my Truſt in Thee, that I may declare thy wondrous Works,</hi> and own thy Ways unſearchable.</p>
            <p>And ſometimes, <hi>by oblique Ways, and ſeemingly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Footſteps of Divine Providence, GOD proceeds to accompliſh his Purpoſes, and his Goings cannot with eaſe be traced. Joſeph,</hi> you are ſenſible, who was envied and hated of his Brethren, was Divinely advertiſed, that he ſhould be raiſed and advanced to great and high Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: And yet by what ſtrange Means, and in what un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely Ways, was it accompliſhed! He was ſold for a Slave and carried into <hi>AEgypt: There,</hi> by reaſon of falſe Accuſation, he was unrighteouſly caſt into Priſon and bound in Irons. And how improbable was it now, that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006716_0011_1029AD89424807B8"/>
he ſhould be releaſed; and how much more unlikely, that he ſhould become a great Man, and be advanced in Dignity and Power, even next to the ſuperb Monarch of <hi>AEgypt?</hi> And yet GOD in His governing Providence promoted his Advancement by the very improbable Ways and Means preceeding it, and made all the ſeemingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable Hindrances and Obſtacles to it effectually to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and complete his admirable Deſigns and Purpoſes.</p>
            <p>And <hi>in the like wonderful Ways</hi> does it ſometimes come to paſs, that <hi>the Projections and Attempts of the great Adverſary and his Inſtruments to ruin the Churches and People of the Son of GOD are baffled and turned into Fooliſhneſs.</hi> So when it was the real Intention and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Endeavor of the <hi>Pagan Roman Emperors,</hi> by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted, long continued and horrible Perſecutions to root Chriſtianity out of the World, it was all to no Purpoſe. No! What then was the Iſſue of their cruel Deſign and their bloodily earneſt Endeavors? See, Sirs, and admire the myſterious and wonderful <hi>Ways of GOD!</hi> An ancient Writer juſtly remark'd with regard to this Affair <hi>Quoties metimur, plures efficimur; The more we are mowed,</hi> ſays <hi>Tertullian, the more we are encreaſed.</hi>—And it cannot have eſcaped our Notice, that, the more the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> have attempted to root out the Proteſtant Religion, it has the more commonly and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully prevail'd; and that maugre all the deceitful Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures projected and all the Methods of Violence and Cruelty uſed by them.</p>
            <p>Beſides; <hi>By ſuch Ways and Means as Mankind would apprehend not to be ſo proper, nor ſo adapted to anſwer the Ends propoſed, does it pleaſe the LORD of all ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to produce great Effects in the World.</hi> Who could have imagined, that <hi>Naaman</hi> the Syrian would have been reſtored to perfect Health by a Method ſo eaſy and gentle? Yet He was thorowly and moſt wondrouſly recovered by it. And who could have hoped, that the Walls of <hi>Jericho</hi> ſhould totter and fall into ſpreading Ruins in ſuch a Way and by ſuch Means as were uſed for it?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:006716_0012_1029AD9007CD8730"/>
Nor yet is This all; But <hi>it ſometimes pleaſes GOD to produce great and marvellous Effects by ſuch Means as Men judge not only to be unlikely, but even to be fooliſh and contemptible.</hi> Thus, without mentioning any other Example of it; it deſerves to be remarked, that many Thouſands and even Millions of People have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted <hi>by the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>by the Preaching of a crucified and Riſen</hi> JESUS, which in the Account of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Greeks</hi> was only Fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>Now how exquiſite and <hi>unſearchable</hi> are theſe <hi>Divine Ways?</hi> Who can accurately trace them, and who can <hi>find them out unto Perfection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>next</hi> Place, Tho' GOD is pleaſed to permit moral Evil in the World, yet <hi>He takes Care by Ways which we cannot trace and inveſtigate to bring great moral Good out of it.</hi>—Thus when it pleaſed Him, that his Son <hi>ſhould be put to Grief,</hi> and He ſuffered that egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious and horrible Crime to be perpetrated, the Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixion of the MESSIAH; it was permitted and came to paſs, that <hi>We might be redeemed from all Iniquity, and purified to Himſelf a peculiar People, zealous of good Works.</hi>—And ſo, in his governing Providence, He often cauſes <hi>the Sins of His People</hi> to be the Occaſion of vaſt moral Good and ſpiritual Advantage to them. He ſo diſpoſes and orders Matters, that Occaſions of Falling and Temptations to Sin are preſented before them: And they, not ſenſible of their Weakneſs and Hazard, and hence not lifting up their Hearts to the GOD of all Grace to guard them againſt the enchanting Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances before them, and <hi>to deliver them from the Evil,</hi> are thro' Inadvertence and Surprize caught, as a ſimple <hi>Bird in the Snare of the Fowler.</hi> Then they are abaſh'd and confounded: And they are thus <hi>humbled and proved;</hi> and for the future they grow more prayerful, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, vigilant and holy in all Manner of Converſation.—So wondrous are the Divine Ways in this Affair as not to be traced by us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:006716_0013_1029AD9351FC4B38"/>
But we proceed to obſerve, in the <hi>Third</hi> and laſt Place, <hi>Unſearchable are thoſe Ways of GOD, and not to be found out, which ſeem not to agree with His Word. By theſe Ways of GOD,</hi> we mean ſuch <hi>Paſſages of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, as ſeem to be inconſiſtent with the Divine Promiſes and Threatnings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is frequently ſuch a State of Things to be found with regard to good and wicked People in the World, that it is not ſo very eaſy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from the Word of GOD to account for it.—Is not <hi>Good promiſed to the Pious,</hi> and is not <hi>penal Evil threatned againſt the Wicked?</hi> How then comes it to paſs, that <hi>the Wicked</hi> are often and long in eaſy and comfortable Circumſtances; while <hi>the Good</hi> are frequently afflicted and exerciſed with great and long continued Sorrows?</p>
            <p>Theſe Things, tho' they be not really repugnant, are yet ſeemingly inconſiſtent and contradictory. And hence very wiſe, as well as very good, Men have been puzled and perplexed with theſe <hi>Divine Ways,</hi> and utterly at a Loſs how to trace and how to account for Them. So it was with the pious <hi>Aſaph,</hi> who declares himſelf to be at a Loſs about the Divine Conduct in theſe Inſtances, as in Pſalm lxxiii. 16. <hi>When I tho't to know</hi> This, <hi>it was too painful for me;</hi> or rather, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the emphatical Hebrew Expreſſion, <hi>it was Labor to mine Eyes</hi> h. e. It greatly fatigued my Mind to look and ſearch into it. And the weeping Prophet, while He allows <hi>the Righteouſneſs of theſe Divine Ways,</hi> yet begs leave to <hi>Reaſon with his GOD concerning His Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> h. e. His holy Purpoſes and the Execution of them. And then He proceeds wondring and enquiring, as in Jerem. xii. 1. <hi>Wherefore doth the Way of the Wicked proſper,</hi> &amp;c?—And another holy Prophet, while He acknowleges the Divine Purity and moral Rectitude, yet at the ſame Time admires at the Divine Conduct in the Inſtance before us and enquires as want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be reſolved about it; ſaying as in Habak. i. 13. <hi>Thou art of purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006716_0014_1029AD94D5B54FE0"/>
canſt not look upon Iniquity:</hi> Wherefore <hi>lookeſt Thou upon them that deal treacherouſly, and boldeſt thy Peace, when the Wicked devoureth the Man that is more righteous than he?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, now for preventing any Confuſion of Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, We muſt be a little more diſtinct and particular.</p>
            <p>On one Hand then, It is obſervable, that <hi>the Ways of GOD ſometimes do not appear to be according to His Threatnings:</hi> And in this Regard His Dealings are not eaſily to be traced. It is Divinely threatned, that <hi>it ſhall go ill with the Wicked, for the Reward of his Hands ſhall be given him:</hi> It is the Divine Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that <hi>there ſhall be many Sorrows to the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> and concerning thoſe, who are <hi>Wicked over much<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> it is ſaid, that <hi>they ſhall die before their Time.</hi> And yet is it not frequently otherwiſe? Have not <hi>the Wicked</hi> often many Advantages and Comforts, and that too ſometimes in a conſtant Series and long Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of them? It is a plain Caſe. The Wicked often <hi>are not in Trouble as other Men, neither are they plagued as others,</hi> who are good and upright: <hi>Their Eyes ſtand out with Fatneſs: They have more than Heart could wiſh.</hi> Yea, ſuch and ſo unſearchable are the Divine Ways, the Wicked ſometimes <hi>live and become old, and grow mighty in Power.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then, on the other Hand, <hi>The Divine Ways ſeem ſometimes to be inconſiſtent</hi> with the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and even contrary to them. There was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Inſtance of this Truth in <hi>the Divine Ways</hi> particularly with regard to the Family of <hi>David<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> Which Ways were ſo myſterious and perplexing, that they were not to be traced. For it was promiſed to <hi>David,</hi> and we have the Promiſe recorded in Pſalm. lxxxix. 36 and 37. <hi>His Seed ſhall endure forever, and his Throne as the Sun: It ſhall be eſtabliſhed forever as the Moon before me,</hi> &amp;c: And yet we find in the 38<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſome following Verſes of the very ſame Pſalm thoſe ſorrowful Complaints and melancholy
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006716_0015_1029AD9809465808"/>
Moans, <hi>But Thou has caſt off and abhorred: Thou haſt been wroth with thine Anointed: Thou haſt made void the Covenant of thy Servant: Thou haſt profaned his Crown by caſting it to the Ground. All that paſs by the Way ſpoil him: He is a Reproach to his Neighbours: Thou haſt covered him with Shame,</hi> &amp;c. How dark were theſe Ways, and how puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling theſe Dealings of the Great GOD! That the Family of <hi>David,</hi> to which ſuch ſignal and glorious Things were promiſed, ſhould be for a Deriſion and Scorn among the Pagans. Is <hi>This,</hi> ſaid they in a taunting Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the poor Captives in <hi>Babylon, Is this your high and mighty King? And where is now your everlaſting Family; from which ONE is to deſcend, who is to rule ever all and reign forever?</hi> Verily at that Time Things look'd very diſcouraging, nor was there any finding out of the Divine Ways.</p>
            <p>But there is, as you are all ſenſible, a more general Promiſe made to the Pious, that <hi>it ſhall be well with</hi> them. And yet, ſuch is the Conduct of Divine Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, it is the Portion of many good Men to ſee evil Days: <hi>Yea few and evil are often the Days of their Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage</hi> here below. And indeed it is no rare and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Thing for them to be <hi>perſecuted for the very ſake of their Vertue and Righteouſneſs: This</hi> it is, which cauſes the Children of Craft and Cruelty to deprive them of their worldly Intereſt by Fraud and Violence: And hence they are conſtrain'd to live in abject Poverty and piteous Wretchedneſs; whereas it might have been quite <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe</hi> with them, if they could licentiouſly treſpaſs on the Laws of Truth and Vertue! And there is a general En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement concerning ſuch as fear JEHOVAH, that <hi>their Days ſhall be prolonged.</hi> And yet how many have there been, whoſe Lives have been ſhortned and <hi>the Number of whoſe Days have been finiſhed;</hi> becauſe, from the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rential <hi>Fear of GOD,</hi> they would not act an immoral and wrong Part? This was the Caſe of Righteous <hi>Abel</hi> who on this very Account was murthered by his inhuman Brother.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:006716_0016_1029AD9B52D574F8"/>
And, beſides ſuch general Engagements, there are <hi>ſome particular ones</hi> with regard to the Children of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and holy Obedience. Thus there is an apparent <hi>Promiſe of long Life to ſuch as are dutiful Children:</hi> And it muſt be allowed, that in many Inſtances it has been accompliſhed. But yet have there not been valuable and very pious Children, ſo dutiful to their Parents as that for the whole World they would not in Action or by a Word offend them, who nevertheleſs <hi>have not been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to continue with them by Reaſon of Death?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And there is alſo <hi>the Promiſe of the Life that now is,</hi> or of worldly and temporal Bleſſings, <hi>to Piety, and ſuch as exerciſe themſelves unto it.</hi> And yet how many have ſuffered as to their worldly Affairs and Intereſts for this very Reaſon, becauſe they have ſtedfaſtly choſen, and would reſolutely practiſe the Things which are pleaſing to GOD?</p>
            <p>But ſome, as we are aware, will be ready to ſtart and ſay, <hi>How can theſe Things be, and how can they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled?</hi> The glorious GOD, who is <hi>the GOD of Truth and without Iniquity, cannot lie:</hi> And hence <hi>all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,</hi> as well as <hi>Threatnings,</hi> of his Word muſt be ſure and faithful. But <hi>how then comes it to paſs, that the Wicked proſper?</hi> And, when it is engaged to the Pious, that <hi>it ſhall be well with them, and temporal Bleſſings ſhall be conferred on them;</hi> nevertheleſs <hi>they have worldly En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments witheld from them,</hi> and have <hi>many Afflictions and much Tribulation</hi> in the World?</p>
            <p>It is uſually ſaid in anſwer to ſuch Enquiries, that, as <hi>the Threatnings of GOD ſhall ſooner or later take Place;</hi> ſo <hi>ſhall the Divine Promiſes.</hi> For <hi>Theſe</hi> are not to be taken <hi>abſolutely;</hi> but they are to be underſtood in this reſtrained Senſe, <hi>ſo far as ſhall be moſt for the Divine Glory and the Good of the Pious.</hi> All indeed muſt allow, that, as the <hi>Divine Wiſdom is infinite; GOD knows what is beſt</hi> upon the whole; and in particular whether worldly Proſperity is beſt for His faithful Servants—It may indeed be <hi>good and very deſireable in itſelf,</hi> and it may be of no
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006716_0017_1029ADA0A6402128"/>
ſmall <hi>Advantage with regard to others.</hi> And yet it may not be convenient, nor yet ſafe, for good People: For it is poſſible, nor at all unlikely, that, if they had a large and affluent Supply of worldly Comforts, they might <hi>be forgetful of GOD,</hi> as well as of themſelves; and ſo give the Reins to criminal Appetites and Inclinations, and hurry on their own Ruin. And as GOD perfectly knows whether outward Proſperity would be thus dangerous and hurtful to them; ſo we cannot ſay, that, ſuppoſing This would be the Caſe, GOD has promiſed to give it unto them.—And beſides, it is probable, that <hi>an adverſe State of Things may be very good</hi> for them: For they may, by Means thereof, be conſiderably advanced in Wiſdom and Vertue; and ſo <hi>GOD may be more glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> by them in this World, and They may <hi>gain a higher Degree of Glory</hi> in the happy Apartments of the inviſible World. And hence an afflicted and ſorrowful Condition in Life may be really better for them than a State of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Proſperity.</p>
            <p>But, with regard both to <hi>the Promiſes and Threatnings</hi> of the Eternal GOD, there is one Thing to be conſidered, which greatly ſerves to remove Objections and ſolve Difficulties as to the Article before us: Which is, that both <hi>the Promiſes and Threatnings of GOD ſhall receive their plenary and perfect Accompliſhment</hi> in the future State.</p>
            <p>As then to the <hi>Threatnings</hi> of the Divine Word againſt thoſe, who go on impenitently and ſecurely in their Sins, <hi>Theſe</hi> ſhall ſurely, punctually and fully come upon them in the future State.—The well-meaning, but ill-judging, Friends of the upright and inflexibly good <hi>Job</hi> inſiſted indeed on it, that <hi>ſignal Calamity muſt come on the Wicked even in this World:</hi> And it muſt be granted, that ſo it ſometimes comes to paſs.—But yet it is frequently other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: They are often preſerved from deſerved Plagues and Miſeries: Tho' they are ſometimes kept from leſſer Judgments, that they may be overwhelm'd with greater in the preſent World. But, in the future State, they
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006716_0018_1029ADA252CB89E8"/>
ſhall have all thoſe Plagues and Miſeries, which are threatned againſt the wicked and impenitent, inflicted on them; and, as it is expreſſed in the prophetical and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Stile, <hi>The Smoke of their Torment ſhall aſcend for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever and ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And then, As to <hi>the Promiſes</hi> of the Faithful GOD, that <hi>the Righteous ſhall flouriſh and ſee Good,</hi> that <hi>their Days ſhall be prolonged,</hi> and they <hi>ſhall rejoice and be glad always;</hi> if He ſee it to be fitteſt and beſt for them, that theſe Promiſes ſhould be accompliſhed unto them in this World, He will doubtleſs take Care in His governing Providence that They ſhall be ſo. But, if, for the moſt wiſe and gracious Purpoſes and Ends, He ſees cauſe not to fulfil theſe Engagements in this World; yet He will certainly and to the full, He will completely and forever make them good in the heavenly World. <hi>There</hi> they ſhall enjoy many Days, and ſee good and rejoice in them all: <hi>There</hi> they ſhall <hi>not lack any good Thing,</hi> but <hi>have all their Wants ſupplied,</hi> and all their Deſires ſatisfied: And <hi>there</hi> their Joy always ſhall be overflowing, and yet ever full: <hi>In thy Preſence,</hi> O Incarnate GOD, <hi>is this Fulneſs of Joy, and at thy Right Hand are theſe Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures forevermore.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have thus been inſtancing in ſome Paſſages of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence, which ſeem to be inconſiſtent, with the Word of GOD, and to run counter to it: Which <hi>Ways of GOD</hi> are indeed very difficult to be traced. We have indeed offered a few Sentiments, which may ſerve in ſome Meaſure to clear and vindicate the Divine Conduct. But yet, after all, <hi>O Thou Firſt, Thou Greateſt and Beſt of Beings, who art the ſupreme Moderator of all Things, and our Lord and Father, we muſt confeſs, that, after all we have heard, it is but a ſmall Portion of thy Conduct which falls within our View: And, as Thy Judgments are unſearchable to us, ſo Thy Ways are paſt finding out by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But, having thus endeavored <hi>to ſet before you ſome of thoſe Ways of GOD which are not to be traced and inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006716_0019_1029ADA58E442150"/>
by us;</hi> our <hi>next</hi> Attempt muſt be to ſhew, that <hi>the Knowlege and Wiſdom of GOD</hi> in theſe His Divine Ways <hi>is not to be traced and inveſtigated by us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now,</p>
            <p>This muſt appear evident to us <hi>from the Nature and Reaſon of the Thing:</hi> For <hi>the Knowlege and Wiſdom of GOD is infinite and eternal</hi> And it therefore becomes us devoutly to acknowlege and adore before Him. <hi>Great is our LORD, and of great Power: His Underſtanding is</hi> infinite; and it is everlaſting. And, becauſe it is ſo; therefore <hi>it is not to be traced and inveſtigated by us.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>the Wiſdom and Knowlege of GOD is His Nature.</hi> And altho' it is common with Divines to aſcribe <hi>Ideas</hi> to the Divine Intellect, and <hi>ſtate the Order</hi> of them <hi>after the Manner of Men;</hi> againſt which we have no Deſign to controvert and contend, tho' we ourſelves are afraid of being ſo preſumptuous; yet the Truth is, that <hi>the Divine Knowlege and Wiſdom is but GOD himſelf.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His <hi>Wiſdom and Knowlege</hi> muſt be infinite and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, eternal and incomprehenſible by Creatures: And hence how is it poſſible, that the <hi>Ways</hi> as well as <hi>Purpoſes of this Knowlege and Wiſdom ſhould be inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by us?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, as <hi>the Wiſdom and Knowlege of GOD is infinite;</hi> on the other Side, <hi>The Knowlege and Wiſdom of Creatures,</hi> and that of even the moſt knowing and wiſe, <hi>is but li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited and finite.</hi> And conſequently the moſt wiſe and knowing of them can only perceive and apprehend <hi>the finite and limited Effects</hi> of Divine and Infinite Knowlege. And verily the Knowlege and Wiſdom of the moſt wiſe and knowing Creatures, when compared with the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of <hi>the only wiſe GOD,</hi> is but <hi>Fooliſhneſs,</hi> but Ignorance, and <hi>leſs than nothing and Vanity.</hi> And is it then probable, or indeed is it poſſible, for ſuch low Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and of ſuch contracted Minds, as Men at beſt are, and for ſuch as ſtand confeſſed to be <hi>ſinful Worms of the Duſt, to ſearch out the Purpoſes of infinite Wiſdom, and trace the Knowlege of the Divine Ways?</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:006716_0020_10293E425C6224D0"/>
But, altho' we muſt be ſenſible of theſe Things, if we duly attend to the <hi>Dictates of Nature and Reaſon;</hi> which we ought very highly to prize, and for which we ought to be very thankful to the eſſential <hi>Word of GOD,</hi> who ſo <hi>enlightneth every Man that cometh into the World:</hi> Nevertheleſs we have a more clear Diſcovery and full Revelation of theſe Things in the inſpired Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, that <hi>the Knowlege and Wiſdom of the Divine Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes and Ways is not to be traced and inveſtigated.</hi> And here will your Goodneſs bear with me and can your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience laſt, while I bring to your Minds ſome Paſſages of the Book of GOD, which ſerve to eſtabliſh it, that <hi>the Wiſdom and Knowlege of the Divine Counſels and Days is unſearchable?</hi> Hear then the Wiſh of <hi>Zophar</hi> with regard to the pious <hi>Job,</hi> in Chapter xi. of <hi>Job,</hi> 5th and 6th Verſes, <hi>O that GOD would ſpeak,—and that HE would ſhew Thee the Secrets of Wiſdom, that are double to that which is!</hi> The <hi>Secrets of Wiſdom</hi> here are <hi>the Divine Counſels and Reaſons of the Divine Proceedings: Theſe</hi> we do not know, nor may we pretend to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them: For They are out of our Sight, nor can we trace them. And <hi>theſe Secrets</hi> of Divine Wiſdom <hi>are double to that which is;</hi> that is, They are much more than what is diſcovered to the humane Race: And <hi>very little indeed</hi> is it, that Men can perceive and know, to what is really in <hi>the Wiſdom and Knowlege of the Divine Counſels and Ways.</hi> And, when the moſt penetrating and enlightned Perſons on Earth have ſearched as far as they could into theſe Things, and reaſoned in the beſt Manner they could concerning them; they have at length been conſtrained to acknowlege and exclaim, as in Job xxvi. 14. <hi>Lo, Theſe are Parts of His Ways: But how little a Portion is heard of Him!</hi>—Again; we read in Pſalm xxxvi. 6. <hi>Thy Judgments,</hi> Jehovah, <hi>are a great Deep: Thy Judgments,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>Thy Counſels and Thy Ways</hi> in the moral Government of the World, <hi>are a great Deep;</hi> ſo that it is not for any mortal Eye or finite Underſtanding to reach them: No! They are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervious
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:006716_0021_1029ADAA5C01C108"/>
and unfathomable to humane Minds.—It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo acknowleged to the Divine Glory, as in Pſalm lxxvii. 19. <hi>Thy Way is in the Sea, and thy Path in the great Waters, and thy Footſteps are not known:</hi> The Senſe and Meaning of which Acknowlegement, as we take it, is, <hi>The Wiſdom and Knowlege of thy Counſels and Ways</hi> is ſo exquiſite and unſearchable, that we cannot inveſtigate them and follow Thee cloſe in them: The <hi>Footſteps of thy Providence</hi> are ſoon loſt out of our View; and we are as much at a Loſs to recover the Traces of them as if Thou didſt <hi>tread on the Sea, and walk over the great Waters.</hi>—Let us alſo attend to what is delivered by <hi>the perfect and upright Man</hi> upon this Article: He, having enquired, <hi>where ſhall Wiſdom be found, and where is the Place of Underſtanding?</hi> And, having repeted the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry a little afterwards, in Job xxviii. 20: He then adds upon it, in Ver. 21, <hi>It is hid from the Eyes of all living;</hi> that is, it is not only hid from all the Animals beneath us, but from all the humane Race, and even all the living Beings who are ſuperior to them in Rank and Underſtanding. But <hi>who then knoweth it?</hi> It follows, in the 23d and 27th Verſes, <hi>GOD underſtandeth the Way thereof; and He knoweth the Way thereof: He prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it: Yea, He ſearched it out:</hi> The Meaning of which, as we humbly conceive, is this, Altho' no one elſe has, yet GOD has, a moſt clear, comprehenſive, full and perfect Knowlege of his own Wiſdom and Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; as Angels and Men gain the Knowlege of the Things which they have thoro'ly <hi>ſearched.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now from theſe Things it ſhould ſeem, that it is <hi>too much for vain Man,</hi> and it will not do for them, to think of <hi>ſearching out the Wiſdom of the Divine Counſels, and the Knowlege of the Divine Ways.</hi> And accordingly ſome of the wiſeſt, as well as the beſt of Men, have been duely ſenſible of <hi>this,</hi> and humbly acknowleged it with regard unto themſelves. <hi>Such Knowlege,</hi> ſays the ſweet Pſalmiſt of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in Pſalm cxxxix. 6, <hi>is too wonderful for me: It is high: I cannot attain unto it.</hi> And altho'
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:006716_0022_1029ADAFA458B3E8"/>
               <hi>Solomon,</hi> the moſt celebrated Man for the Character of <hi>Wiſe, ſearched after this Wiſdom,</hi> yet he could by no means inveſtigate it to his own Satisfaction: <hi>I beheld,</hi> writes he in Eccleſ. viii. 17, <hi>all the Work of GOD, that a Man cannot find out the Work that is done under the Sun: Becauſe, tho'</hi> a Man <hi>labor to ſeek it out, yet he ſhall not find it: Yea further, tho'</hi> a wiſe Man <hi>think to know it, yet he ſhall</hi> not be able to find it.</p>
            <p>Thus it has been our Attempt to ſhew, that <hi>in the Divine Ways,</hi> as well as <hi>Counſels, there is ſuch a Divine Wiſdom and Knowlege as is not to be traced and inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by us:</hi> And, if our Attempt has in any Meaſure ſucceeded, <hi>O GOD and Father of the Spirits of all Fleſh, Not unto us, not unto us,</hi> who are feeble and vile; <hi>but to thy Divine Power and the unſearchable Riches of thy Grace be the Praiſe and Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But we are now, in the <hi>laſt</hi> Place, to reflect in a ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Manner upon what has been offered.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Firſt</hi> Place then, <hi>Since the Counſels of GOD are unſearchable, and His Ways paſt finding out;</hi> hence <hi>let not any of us too buſily and curiouſly prie into theſe Secrets of the Deity. Secret Things,</hi> we are expreſly inform'd, <hi>belong unto GOD,</hi> but <hi>Things revealed belong to us and to our Children.</hi> And yet, ſuch is the Vanity of human Minds, and ſuch the Corruption of Mens Hearts, that they do not give a ſuitable Attention nor pay a proper Regard to <hi>Things revealed;</hi> while at the ſame Time they are for entring into the Palace of the immortal King and enquiring into the impenetrable <hi>Secrets of His Cabinet,</hi> and they have even the hardineſs to divulge their own Diſcoveries. But this is quite wrong and vain in us.—It ought to humble us, that the leaſt and moſt common Things in the World are beyond our thorow Knowledge and Comprehenſion: And how then can we expect by the moſt careful Reſearches <hi>to comprehend the Nature of GOD, His moral Government and the Manner of His In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:006716_0023_1029ADB1262D9710"/>
upon his intelligent and moral Creatures? <hi>O let not our Eyes be lofty, nor Hearts ſo haughty and vain as to exerciſe ourſelves</hi> too much in theſe Things, <hi>which are too great and high</hi> for us. There is a good Paſſage to this Purpoſe of one of the greateſt Divines, that has lived ſince the Days of Inſpiration, with regard to the Divine Counſels and the Divine Manner of influencing moral Agents, which we may do well to entertain and keep in our Minds for ſuppreſſing their Vanity as to theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; <hi>If,</hi> ſays he, in his <hi>Catholic Theology, any particular Manner thereof offer itſelf to your Minds, as that which probably ſeems to be the Right; it may afford you Reaſon</hi> therefore <hi>to ſuſpect, that</hi> it is not the Right; <hi>Becauſe it is certain the Manner is beyond our Reach: And what Man can comprehend is infinitely below GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However in the next Place, <hi>let us not</hi> hence conclude, <hi>that, ſince the Ways,</hi> as well as <hi>Counſels of GOD, are paſt finding out,</hi> therefore <hi>we may be careleſs or negligent about making any Enquiry concerning the Divine Conduct and the Works of Divine Providence.</hi> There are indeed <hi>ſome</hi> of the Divine Ways which eſcape our View and exceed our Comprehenſion: But then there are <hi>others,</hi> which can more eaſily be traced and better underſtood. Thus it is particularly as to thoſe <hi>grievous</hi> Calamities, with which GOD is pleaſed ſometimes to viſit a faithleſs and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious People: For <hi>he, that runs, may read</hi> Part of the Divine Intent and Meaning in them, and perceive in ſome good Meaſure <hi>wherefore God contendeth with them:</hi> 'Tis this, as Divine Inſpiration has given it unto us, in Pſalm xxviii. 5, Becauſe <hi>they regard not the Works of the LORD, nor the Operations of His Hands, the LORD will not build them up, but deſtroy them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And,</p>
            <p>In the Third Place, As it appears, that the <hi>Counſels of GOD are unſearchable and his Ways paſt finding out;</hi> let us hence <hi>have a Care of miſinterpreting the Divine Methods and Ways,</hi> and ſo <hi>making a wrong Uſe and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006716_0024_1029ADB46EB6B5B0"/>
of them.</hi> The Divine Majeſty, who rules and who <hi>doeth whatſoever He pleaſes among the Inhabitants of this World,</hi> as well as governs in the Armies of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above, may ſeem ſometimes <hi>to frown upon his People, and to ſmile on their Enemies.</hi> But what then? Shall we hence imagine, that GOD approves of wicked Men, and is regardleſs of the People whom He loves? No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This would be a wrong Conſtruction and Senſe of the Matter: And it would be very irregular and ſinful to act from ſuch an Apprehenſion. And, in order to guard us againſt any ſuch Miſapprehenſion and bad Conduct, let us attend to what the Divine Being has reveled by one of His Prophets, in Mal. iii. from the 14th V. <hi>Ye have ſaid, It is vain to ſerve GOD: And what Profit is it that we kept his Ordinance, and that we have walked mournfully before the Lord of Hoſts? And now we call the Proud hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: yea they that work Wickedneſs are ſet up, yea they that tempt GOD are even delivered. Then they, that feared the LORD, ſpake often one to another; and the LORD hearkned and heard, and a Book of Remembrance was written before Him for them that feared the LORD and that tho't upon his Name: And they ſhall be mine, ſaith the LORD of Hoſts, in that Day when I make up my Jewels; and I will ſpare them, as a Man ſpareth his own Son that ſerveth him:</hi> Then <hi>ſhall ye return and diſcern between the Righteous and the Wicked; between him that ſerveth GOD, and him that ſerveth Him not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, and in the <hi>laſt</hi> Place, <hi>Let us all,</hi> upon the whole, <hi>prepare and ripen, by the Aſſiſtance of Divine Grace, for the happy Time, wherein we may enjoy more clear and full Diſcoveries of the Divine Counſels, and the dark and myſterious Ways of Divine Providence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We live in a World, wherein gloomy and perplexing Events do ever and anon occur: And ſuch are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>the Ways</hi> of Divine Providence, ſo dark and very intricate are they, that <hi>in vain do our Underſtandings try to trace them,</hi> and find out the particular Intent and preciſe Meaning of them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:006716_0025_1029ADB7CE0BF668"/>
And now,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Honorable, Reverend and Beloved Hearers,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am very well perſuaded, that you conſider the Death of the High, Puiſſant and moſt Illuſtrious Prince, FREDERICK LEWIS, Elder Son of our moſt gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign King <hi>GEORGE</hi> the Second, Prince of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> Electoral-Prince of <hi>Brunſwick-Lunen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales, &amp;c.</hi> as a very darkſome Event, and <hi>one of the</hi> myſterious <hi>Ways of GOD which is not to be inveſtigated</hi> by us.</p>
            <p>'Twas on the <hi>Night of Gloomineſs, Clouds and thick Darkneſs</hi> preceeding the Twenty-firſt of <hi>March,</hi> between eleven and twelve o'Clock, that He departed this Life, to the utmoſt Grief of His Royal Parent, His Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conſort, and the whole Royal Family; and to the inexpreſſible Sorrow, as well as unſpeakable Loſs, of the Public; who had conceived highly concerning Him, who expected good and great Things from ſuch a wiſe and merciful Prince, and were ready to ſay, <hi>This ſame ſhall</hi> hereafter more conſiderably and extenſively <hi>comfort us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ah! How are our fond Hopes withered! How are our pleaſing Views and Expectations at an End! For the <hi>lovely Prince,</hi> as well as the rough Peaſant, dies and returns to the Duſt.—Thus, <hi>LORD GOD, haſt Thou turned our promiſing Hope and Joy into Diſappointment and Mourning: Thou hast deprived us of Gladneſs, and girded us with Sackcloth: Thou doſt hide thy Face from us; and we are troubled.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be reaſonably expected, that we, on this Side of the wide <hi>Atlantic,</hi> ſhould be able, from a thorow Knowlege of the dear PRINCE, to give Him his entire and juſt Character: And hence we ſhall not be ſo aſpiring as to undertake it.</p>
            <p>But however, ſince there are ſundry Particulars rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Him which have reached us; and as it is fit and right, that Theſe ſhould be rehearſed; and that not only
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006716_0026_1029ADBB19AF8FC0"/>
out of Reſpect unto Him, but from a Religious Regard to <hi>the Prince of the Kings of the Earth,</hi> that ſo the Glory of His Gifts and Benefits may redound unto Him; therefore we cannot well be excuſed from piouſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring theſe Things.</p>
            <p>As the beſt Care was taken with regard to his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs's Education; ſo his Improvements in Wiſdom and Goodneſs were anſwerable to it: For He ſoon diſcovered, that <hi>He carried a Mind within Him</hi> beyond his Years, <hi>and manly Tho'ts and Concerns</hi> in the Bloom of Youth: And, as apprehending Himſelf <hi>born for greater Things</hi> than thoſe, about which young People generally employ themſelves, He behaved Himſelf accordingly. And, <hi>on theſe Accounts,</hi> He ſoon became no leſs dear to his Royal Parents, than on the Account of his Deſcent from Them.</p>
            <p>It was no Diſadvantage to the PRINCE, that He was of a ſweet and engaging Aſpect, and a very agreeable Air and Deportment; For, by means of Theſe external Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, He at once drew and allured the Affection of all, who had any Senſe of what is amiable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming.</p>
            <p>But it was much more to his real Character and Credit and Glory, that he was of a humane, benevolent and kind Temper of Mind: And hence He was eaſy of Acceſs, courteous of Speech and condeſcending in Behaviour: For, altho' He were next in Dignity to his moſt excellent Majeſty, the KING, Yet He conſidered Himſelf <hi>as a Man and a Subject,</hi> in common with the Reſt of his Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Subjects beneath Him: And hence He converſed and acted in the Palace and abroad with continual Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuetude, Humility and Gentleneſs.</p>
            <p>As He very well knew, that <hi>Political Knowledge and Wiſdom</hi> was requiſite to qualify one for the Government of others; therefore he was careful and induſtrious to acquire this Knowledge and Wiſdom, both from the moſt able Preceptors and from approved Authors: Tho' at the ſame Time other Branches of Science were not neglected by Him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:006716_0027_1029ADC3F940A978"/>
Behold Him at length commencing Man; and, thro' the tender Care of our gracious Sovereign, happily mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a Princeſs of matchleſs Form, of ſurpaſſing Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, a ſhining Pattern of Vertue and of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable Merit in the Eſteem of all around her. And now how careful was he to perform the Offices of the wedded State, and <hi>ſet a bright Example of connubial Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity and Tenderneſs, in the midſt of an adulterous and profligate Generation.</hi> And it ſurely demonſtrates a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Degeneracy of Manners and a ſhameleſs Effron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery in Vice, that ſo many would ſtill licentiouſly break the Nuptial Bond; while they had the Example of the PRINCE, as well as the <hi>Laws and Threatnings of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal GOD,</hi> againſt them.</p>
            <p>The worthy PRINCE, <hi>as not born for Himſelf but Others,</hi> was ſtudious to behave aright and well towards them. Hence He was devoted to his Royal Parent and the public Good: And as He wore the Motto on his Arms as Prince of <hi>Wales, Ich Dien,</hi> or <hi>I ſerve;</hi> ſo <hi>He fulfilled it:</hi> For He tho't it <hi>his Honor to ſerve</hi> the beſt of Kings, as well as of Parents; and, while He was <hi>the Delight of all Mankind,</hi> He was <hi>willing to ſerve and help</hi> them all.</p>
            <p>He gave the World ſome Specimens and Proofs of his Diſpoſition to promote the Trade and Commerce of his Royal Parent's Kingdoms, and to encourage Learning and uſeful Arts in them: And it was doubtleſs pleaſing to His Majeſty's good Subjects at Home, as it has been to us in theſe diſtant Lands, that He, on theſe Accounts, received ſuch fit Acknowlegements and public Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of Reſpect and Gratitude. Beſides his being the firſt Commiſſioner for building the Royal Hoſpital at <hi>Greenwich,</hi> and Governor of the <hi>Britiſh white Herring Fiſhery;</hi> He was choſen the Chancellor of the Univerſity of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and a Fellow of the Royal Society in <hi>London,</hi> and received other Teſtimonies beſides of national Eſteem.</p>
            <p>It muſt be mentioned to his Renown, that He in an exemplary Way <hi>attended on the public Offices of Religion:
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:006716_0028_1029ADC58A060A40"/>
Nor was He aſhamed,</hi> as too many of the great Ones of the Earth ſeem to be, <hi>to acknowlege his Maker and Lord,</hi> as well as ours, <hi>in private</hi> with his Houſhold.</p>
            <p>And beſides, He was <hi>a Prince in Goodneſs and Benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and exhibited a high and mighty <hi>Pattern of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Love and good Works.</hi> Among the Proofs and Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of This, <hi>New-England</hi> has ſome to produce and utter with ſingular Delight and Satisfaction. <hi>His Royal Highneſs</hi> was pleaſed to ſend a very handſome Gratuity towards the School for the Education of Indian Children at <hi>Houſitonock</hi> under the Care of the late pious and learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mr. <hi>Sergeant.</hi> And, as we underſtand, it was the expreſſed Deſign and Purpoſe of the PRINCE to grant to the Succeſſor of the ſame reverend and very valuable Miſſionary, if properly recommended, a very handſome Annuity as long as He lived. So that the Goodneſs and Charity of his Royal Highneſs, like the pleaſing Light of the <hi>Morning-Star,</hi> was not confined to <hi>the other He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſphere,</hi> but ſhone over the vaſt Ocean, and reached to the diſtant Wilds of theſe <hi>American</hi> Regions.</p>
            <p>His Royal Highneſs, the PRINCE, thorowly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, that, altho' Government was of Divine Inſtitution, yet the Form of it is an humane Ordinance: He knew, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monarchy was not abſolute and indefeazable, but <hi>elective and hereditarily ſo:</hi> He ſaw clearly, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was <hi>lawful</hi> in the Adminiſtration but what was <hi>allowed by the Laws</hi> of the Realm; and that He, who wears the Crown by the National Conſent and Choice, is not above the Laws, nor at Liberty to diſpenſe with them.—Nor have we any Doubt, but that his Royal Highneſs was confirmed in theſe Sentiments and Views from the Adminiſtration of His moſt Excellent Father and Grandfather, and ſo eſtabliſhed in his Purpoſes by the Will of GOD to rule and govern according to them.</p>
            <p>Thus was his Royal Highneſs <hi>prepared to be the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his People,</hi> before He was really ſo: And, by all that we can collect, He was inflexibly determined to do nothing that might prove detrimental to the Intereſts
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006716_0029_1029ADC70D2138A8"/>
of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and it's Dependencies; nor to neglect any Thing, which might promote, ſecure and protract the Welfare and Happineſs of the People to be <hi>his future Charge. His future Charge,</hi> did I ſay? Alas! He muſt be <hi>juſt fitted and qualified</hi> to receive them <hi>as ſuch;</hi> and yet, <hi>ſo unſearchable is the Divine Conduct.</hi> He muſt be <hi>removed from them,</hi> nor inherit their delightful Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage and Subjection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Theſe</hi> are a few, of the many valuable Things, relating to His Royal Highneſs; which endeared Him unto us while living; and which, at his Deceaſe, cauſe a general Concern and Grief, and the ſuitable Expreſſions of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us.</p>
            <p>We are now therefore dutifully following our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Sovereign and Father, the KING, and our Mother Kingdoms, tho' <hi>with more late and unequal Steps,</hi> in paying our mournful Reſpects on the Account of the PRINCE's Exit.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty's good and moſt dutiful Subjects of this Province, who enjoy the Benefit of the Civil Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Favor of our Religious Rights and Privileges; and who are as a People, if we underſtand our own Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, the moſt thorow Aſſerters of the juſt Liberties of Mankind, are <hi>to a Man inviolably attached to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty King</hi> GEORGE, <hi>and the Proteſtant Succeſſion in his Royal Houſe: To a Man</hi> therefore we unite in deploring the Loſs of his Royal Son: And it is our united Wiſh and moſt fervent Prayer, that His Majeſty may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported under this grievous Bereavement; that He may gain ſpiritual Good by it, and that, by the Loſs of his own deſireable Son, He may be further <hi>influenced and animated to eſpouſe the Cauſe of the Son of GOD,</hi> and promote His Kingdom and Intereſt not only at Home, but in other <hi>European</hi> Nations alſo.</p>
            <p>We have alſo a moſt tender Sympathy with Thee, Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Princeſs AUGUSTA, who haſt loſt thy well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:006716_0030_1029ADC8903640D8"/>
and excellent Prince; and who, as long as Thou didſt enjoy Him, didſt exhibit a great and engaging Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of conjugal Affection and Obedience. <hi>The LORD GOD Almighty ſtrengthen Thee, and uphold Thee by the Right Hand of his Righteouſneſs! The Prince of Life be with thee, thy conſtant Guide and kind Supporter! May He never forſake, and never fail Thee!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſame Time we condole with his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the DUKE, with the Princeſſes and the Reſt of the Royal Family; heartily deſiring and entreating, that the GOD of all Grace and Comfort would afford unto them <hi>Spiritual Supplies and Conſolations,</hi> which are indeed <hi>no ſmall Things;</hi> but unſpeakably greater and more glorious than all the Delights and Grandeurs which this World can afford them.</p>
            <p>Our Hearts too are properly affected in thinking of <hi>the Poſterity of his Royal Highneſs:</hi> And we are much grieved for them, that They are ſo early and ſoon depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of their meritorious Parent; and ſo They may not be allowed any longer to be inſtructed by his Counſels, and charmed and led along by his Example. We bleſs however the Divine Arbiter and Sovereign LORD of the World, that He has not left <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies to <hi>bewail a broken Lineage and a doubtful Throne:</hi> For his Royal Highneſs has left <hi>five Sons and three Daughters</hi> as Pledges of Peace and Comfort unto us. And it is now our humble and earneſt Prayer, that his Royal Highneſs Prince GEORGE, <hi>ſweet Youth,</hi> our FREDERICK now, who ſuceeds his Father as Heir ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent to the Imperial Crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and that his Royal Highneſs's Brethren and Siſters alſo may be the Special Care and Charge of Divine Providence, that they may be preſerved for eminent Bleſſings, and that the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Wiſdom and heroic Vertues of their long and glorious Train of Anceſtors, from his preſent Majeſty, whom GOD preſerve, even back to the Times of the Reformation, may be inherited and poſſeſſed by them.</p>

We have thus been diſcharging our Duty to a moſt valuable and excellent Prince: Griev'd am I, and aſhamed, that my Part has been perform'd no better; yet hoping, that an honeſt Deſign and Endeavour to do well will not be contemned by thoſe of greater Abilities.</p>
            <p>But, ſince it appears, that a moſt ſorrowful Event has befallen us; the Queſtion is, <hi>What is the Improvement that we are to make of it?</hi> What are we to do for the Support of our Minds under it, and to keep them from ſinking under the Preſſure of ſuch a heavy Bereavement, as well as all other grievous Diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hear now</hi> then <hi>the Concluſion of the whole Matter.</hi> Let us all both Rulers and Subjects, both high and low, both rich and poor together, by the Aids and Aſſiſtances of Divine Grace moſt heartily implored and thankfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, <hi>not put our Truſt in Princes, nor any of the Sons of Men, in whom there is no help: For their Breath goeth forth: They return to the Earth, and in that very Day all their Tho'ts</hi> concerning us <hi>periſh.</hi> But let us <hi>put our Truſt in the almighty Power and infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs of GOD:</hi> For altho' an excellent Prince has left our Earth, <hi>to ſit,</hi> as we truſt, <hi>with Princes above,</hi> even <hi>with the Princes</hi> of the heavenly Court; and, on the Account of This, as well as <hi>the ſad moral State of Things</hi> at Home, and in our Land, our Minds cannot but be clouded and filled with Perplexities and Fears; yet we ought, from a clear Apprehenſion of the infinite Wiſdom, Ability and Readineſs of GOD to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear for us and protect and bleſs us, to <hi>make Theſe,</hi> as well as His Promiſes thro' JESUS CHRIST, <hi>our Hope and Truſt and unfailing Refuge:</hi> And accordingly, let us, from a real Conviction and hearty Senſe of theſe Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Perfections and Promiſes, <hi>commit the Caſe</hi> of our Nations and this poor Land to the Divine Being, <hi>with Hope in his Mercy,</hi> as well as Dependance on His Power and Wiſdom, yet to ſave, defend and proſper us; but
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:006716_0032_1029ADCD48F15A38"/>
with an entire and profound Reſignation to His ſovereign Will.—And let us all <hi>acquaint our ſelves with our GOD and be at Peace:</hi> Let us <hi>think on our Ways, and turn our Feet into the Divine Teſtimonies;</hi> let us <hi>make haſte and make no Delay to turn to GOD thro' the only Mediator, and to glorify Him on the Earth and ſerve our Generation according to His Will,</hi> as well as to <hi>work out our own Salvation with Fear and Trembling.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things are eſſentially fit and right: And They are good and profitable unto Men: And, <hi>if we do theſe Things,</hi> and continue conſtant and <hi>faithful unto the Death</hi> in them; Then, we ſhall <hi>have an open and abundant En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance miniſtred to us into the everlaſting Kingdom of our great</hi> LORD <hi>and</hi> SAVIOUR: Then, The dark Events of relative Time will be explained to univerſal Satisfaction; and <hi>thoſe Counſels and Ways of GOD,</hi> which have been inexplicable, nor to be inveſtigated by us, <hi>will be unfolded and appear in a Light unſpeakable and full of Glory:</hi> And, in Fine, Then, Then, All the intelligent happy Creation will with one Conſent render due Acknowlege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Glories to GOD and the Lamb: And may we all, without one of this great Aſſembly miſſing, join the Heavenly Throng, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſing and Honor and Glory be to Him that ſitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb forever and ever,</hi> AMEN!</p>
