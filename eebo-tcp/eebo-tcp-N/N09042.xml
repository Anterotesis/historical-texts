            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

—When they ſaw reaſon of ſtate urged as elements of law, judges as ſharp-ſighted as ſecretaries of ſtate, judgment of law grounded upon matter of fact of which there was neither enquiry nor proof, and no reaſon given for the payment but what included all the eſtates of the ſtanders by, they had no reaſon to hope that doctrine, or the promoters of it, would be contained within any bounds; and it is no wonder that they who had ſo little reaſon to be pleaſed with their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition were no leſs ſolicitous for, or apprehenſive of the inconveniences that might attend any alteration.<bibl> —<hi>Hiſtory of the long Rebellion, vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 70, 71.</bibl>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOUGH few or none claim infallibility in expreſs terms, yet it is very difficult ever to perſuade ſome men they are miſtaken. We generally have ſo good an opinion of our own underſtanding, that inſenſibly we take it for granted thoſe that do not think as we do muſt needs be in the wrong. When diſputes are once heightened by perſonal prejudice, or the bitterneſs of party, it becomes ſo much the more difficult to the diſputants themſelves to ſee their miſtakes, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to byſtanders the truth appears wrapped up in a cloud, and through the fog and duſt of argument becomes almoſt impercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible.</p>
            <p>Theſe remarks I believe will particularly hold good in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject now in agitation between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her colonies, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject however of too ſerious a nature to be given up to prejudice, or to be decided by the rage of party. Every argument <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>con</hi> deſerves to be moſt carefully weighed, and he that ſets the whole in the cleareſt light does the publick no inconſiderable ſervice, and that whether it be by pointing out the juſtice of the <hi>American</hi> claims to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> or ſetting ſuch conſtitutional arguments before the <hi>Americans</hi> as muſt either leave obſtinacy inexcuſable, or will diſpoſe loyal and reaſonable men to a chearful acquieſcence.</p>
            <p>The argument on which the <hi>Americans</hi> ſeem to lay the greateſt ſtreſs is, they ſay that it is a principle of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution that no <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ought to be taxed but by his own conſent, given ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by himſelf or his repreſentative. I find it admitted by ſuch as diſapprove the <hi>American</hi> claims, that no man is bound by any law to which he hath not given his conſent either in perſon or by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative. Perhaps theſe two propoſitions are not perfectly equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent; however it ſeems clear, that he that holds that no man is bound BY ANY LAW to which he has not perſonally or by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative conſented, muſt alſo admit, that no man is bound by any law that lays a tax on him without his conſent given by himſelf or repreſentative. What is true of ALL laws in general muſt alſo. hold true of EVERY law in particular. If no law can operate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any man that hath not in the above manner given his aſſent to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:011542_0003_0F8725F951F0F0F8"/>
it, certainly no ſuch law can be binding upon whole communities, or any conſiderable part of the whole nation. In the ſpirit of the above principle, it ſeems eſſential to law, that it be aſſented to by ſuch on whom it is afterwards to operate. To ſuppoſe, therefore, that a law is binding upon ſuch as have not given their aſſent, is to ſuppoſe (I argue upon that principle) a law may be valid and binding at the ſame time it is confeſſedly deſtitute of the very eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential point to make it ſo; and if the aſſent of thoſe that are to be governed by the law is not neceſſary or eſſential to the making of it, then repreſentation is a mere ſuperfluous thing, no better than an excreſcence in the legiſlative power, which therefore at any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient time may be lopped off at pleaſure, and without the leaſt danger to the conſtitution; the governed then have no part in the legiſlation at all, the will of thoſe in power, whoever they be, is the ſupreme and ſole law, and what hath been above aſſerted to be a conſtitutional principle ſeems to me to fall to the ground without remedy to all intents and purpoſes.</p>
            <p>Suppoſing, on the other hand, that principle, as is aſſerted to be conſtitutional, then to me, as is further aſſerted, it ſeems to be of the very nature of it, that it be general and hold in all caſes. This it does not only clearly imply, but alſo fully and ſtrongly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs; but yet if ſo, it would alſo ſeem that no man, or no people, in no caſe, or by no power whatever, can be bound to pay a tax to which they have not conſented either perſonally or by their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives. Every conſtitutional principle muſt be general and hold in all caſes, and I may add in all places too, for it is uſually ſaid that the liberties of an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> follow him to the end of the world, much more then muſt they follow him over all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; this is ſo true, that by an expreſs law, the children of <hi>Britiſh</hi> parents, though born in a foreign dominion, are juſt as much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to all <hi>Britiſh</hi> liberties as thoſe who have been born within the realm.</p>
            <p>An inference may poſſibly hence be drawn, that if ſo, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> colonies are ſubject to none of the acts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, (<hi>ſcil.</hi> becauſe they never aſſented to them neither in perſon nor by repreſentative) and therefore muſt be conſidered as independent of the legal or parliamentary power of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> I confeſs I ſhould be ſorry to ſee <hi>America</hi> independent of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and if any of the arguments the <hi>Americans</hi> make uſe of imply an independency on the mother ſtate, I ſhould ſhrewdly ſuſpect there muſt be ſome fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy couched under an otherwiſe ſpecious appearance. The ſum and ſtrength of this inference I conceive lies thus: The <hi>Britiſh</hi> le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature muſt be the ſupreme power in all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions, and if ſo, all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions ought to pay obedience in all caſes to all the laws in which they are mentioned that may be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:011542_0004_0F8725FA1EF2ED88"/>
by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, and to refuſe obedience in any ſuch caſe is to declare themſelves an independent people.</p>
            <p>I freely own I have not heard any thing ſtronger ſaid in favour of taxation by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, and I think this argument is highly deſerving the moſt ſerious conſideration. Every good man would wiſh to hear the voice of diſpaſſionate reaſon before he forms his judgment in any debate. Vulgar prejudices may ſway vulgar minds, but a wiſe man is neither carried away by the torrent of power, nor the blaſt of popularity. I would endeavour therefore to conſider this argument with all the can our and impartiality I am capable of; I would do it with a mind open to conviction, and with ſteadineſs ſufficient to follow truth wherever ſhe may lead me.</p>
            <p>To have a clear view how far this argument may affect the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent queſtion between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her colonies, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary carefully to ſtate the relation which they bear to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; without this we ſhall never have a preciſe and determinate idea of the matter. The argument I think is made up of two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is the ſupreme legiſlature in all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire.</p>
            <p>All the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions therefore ought to pay obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in all caſes and to all the laws in which they are mentioned, and to refuſe obedience to any ſuch is to declare themſelves an independent people.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed to take a diſtinct view of each of theſe propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I repeat, that they are ſaid to be built upon a conſtitutional principle, and that this principle muſt be general and hold in all caſes; this muſt undoubtedly be admitted, for what enters into the very eſſence of the conſtitution muſt doubtleſs operate as far as the conſtitution itſelf. Let us now proceed to conſider every part of theſe two propoſitions diſtinctly, and this muſt infallibly lead us to form a ſound judgment of the whole.</p>
            <p>The kingdom of GREAT-BRITAIN conſiſts of two parts, north and ſouth, or <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> united ſince 1707 into one kingdom, under the name of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> This union hath not been ſo full and abſolute, as to put both kingdoms in all reſpects upon a perfect equality; but tho' the legiſlature is the ſame, yet the laws and the adminiſtration of juſtice are not the ſame in every inſtance. The ſame legiſlature making laws that affect only the one or the other of theſe kingdoms, and even laws made to be binding upon both, do not affect both alike, of which the difference in raiſing the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies by land tax is a very full and ſtriking proof, this could not be the caſe if the union between the two kingdoms was ſo entire and abſolute, as for inſtance between <hi>England</hi> and the principality of <hi>Wales.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The BRITISH EMPIRE is a more extenſive word, and ſhould not
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:011542_0005_0F8725FAD6450CC0"/>
be confounded with the kingdom or <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; it conſiſts of <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> the Iſlands of <hi>Man, Jerſey, Guernſey, Gibraltar,</hi> and <hi>Minorca, &amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean; Senegal, &amp;c.</hi> in <hi>Africa; Bombay, &amp;c.</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi>; and the Iſlands and Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in <hi>North-America, &amp;c.</hi> As <hi>England,</hi> ſtrictly ſo called, is at the head of this great body, it is called the mother country; all the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled inhabitants of this vaſt empire are called <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> but indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, from the place of their nativity or reſidence, are called <hi>Engliſh, Scotch, Iriſh, Welch, Americans, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> were originally diſtinct kingdoms and nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the colonies in <hi>America,</hi> being ſettled upon lands diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under charters from the crown of <hi>England,</hi> were always conſidered as a part of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation, and of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, and looked upon as dependent upon <hi>England</hi>; I mean, that before the union of the two kingdoms, (and very few colonies have been ſettled ſince) they depended on <hi>England</hi> only, and even now I ſuppoſe are rather conſidered as a dependance upon <hi>England</hi> than of the two kingdoms united under the name of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> Were it not for the union, which incorporates the two kingdoms, the colonies never would have depended on that part of <hi>Britain</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Scotland,</hi> and by the terms of the union I apprehend <hi>England</hi> has not given up or brought her colonies under the dominion of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but tho' dependent on <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> they ſtill remain what they always were, <hi>Engliſh</hi> colonies.</p>
            <p>All the inhabitants of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire together form the BRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TISH NATION, and that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament is the ſupreme power and legiſlature in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation I never heard doubted.</p>
            <p>By the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution, which is that which prevails over the whole empire, all <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> or all that make up the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, are entitled to certain privileges indefeaſible, unalienable, and of which they can never be deprived, but by the taking away of that conſtitution which gives them theſe privileges. I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire is made up of different kingdoms and nations, but it is not the original conſtitution of <hi>Scotland</hi> or <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> but of <hi>England,</hi> which extends and communicates its privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges to the whole empire. This is an undeniable principle, and ought never to be loſt out of ſight, if we would form a ſound judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the queſtion now to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>From the conſideration above admitted, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is the ſupreme legiſlative power in the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, the following concluſion has been drawn; the colonies (and the ſame I ſuppoſe is meant of all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, of which the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies are a part) are bound by and ſubject to all the laws of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament in which they are mentioned, or are ſubject to none of any kind whatſoever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:011542_0006_0F8725FB979AFFD0"/>Before this can be properly diſcuſſed, it muſt be obſerved, that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has not only a Parliament, which is the ſupreme legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature, but alſo a conſtitution, and that the now Parliament derives its authority and power from the conſtitution, and not the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution from the Parliament. It may alſo be very fairly inferred hence, that the liberties of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> ariſe from and depend on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution, which is permanent and ever the ſame, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the individuals which compoſe the Parliament are changed at leaſt once every ſeven years, and always at the demiſe of a king.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is the ſupreme legiſlature in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire. It muſt be ſo either abſolutely or agreeable to the conſtitution; if abſolutely, it can alter the conſtitution whenever it ſees fit; if abſolutely, it is not bound by the conſtitution, nor any thing elſe; if agreeable to the conſtitution, then it can no more make laws, which are againſt the conſtitution, or the unalterable privileges of <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects, than it can alter the conſtitution itſelf. Suppoſing a Parliament, under ſome of the arbitrary reigns of the laſt century, ſhould have made a law, that for the future the king's warrant ſhould be ſufficient to lay a tax on the ſubject, or to oblige him to pay ſhip money, it would have been an act of the ſupreme legiſlature, but it may ſafely be doubted, whether the nation would have thought it conſtitutional. I conclude therefore, that the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Parliament, and of every branch of it, has its bounds aſſigned by the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>If the power of the Parliament is limited by the conſtitution, it may not be improper next to enquire, whether the power of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament affects all the ſubjects of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire in the ſame manner.</p>
            <p>If the power of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament affects all the ſubjects of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire in the ſame manner, it follows, that all the laws made by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament are binding alike upon all thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whom this power extends, or in other words, that all the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire are bound not only by thoſe laws in which they are expreſsly mentioned, but every law by the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made, for what need is there to mention every individual of thoſe for whom the law is made in general, every ſubject therefore of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, upon this ſuppoſition, muſt be bound by every law of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, unleſs expreſsly excepted.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that hold the ſubjects of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> living without <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> are bound by every law in which they are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, ſeem alſo clearly to hold, that the ſame perſons are not bound by ſuch laws in which they are not mentioned. Thus the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative, that the ſubjects of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire muſt be ſubject to all or none of the laws of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, is limited even by thoſe who plead for an univerſal ſubmiſſion. He that is only bound
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011542_0007_0F8725FC509B1D28"/>
to obey ſome laws, cannot be ſaid to be bound by all laws, as, on the contrary, he that is bound to obey all laws, is excuſed in none.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe, before the union with <hi>Scotland,</hi> none would have ſcrupled to call the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament the ſupreme legiſlature of all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, though <hi>Scotland</hi> was ſtill an independent kingdom, and by the union <hi>Scotland</hi> and its Parliament was not ſwallowed up and abſorbed by <hi>England</hi> and its Parliament, but unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the kingdom, and the Parliaments alſo of the two kingdoms united in one general legiſlature. The eccleſiaſtical laws and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution alſo of each kingdom remains as it was before, <hi>i. e.</hi> entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different from each other.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may not be amiſs to conceive, that the authority of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament extends over the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation, though the different reſpective ſubjects are not altogether alike affected by its laws: That, with regard to national trade, the power of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it moſt beneficial to the head and every branch of the empire is veſted in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, as the ſupreme power in the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and that all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects every where have a right to be ruled by the known principles of their common conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Next, it may be proper to take a nearer view how far, and in what manner, the acts of Parliament operate upon the different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire.</p>
            <p>ENGLAND doubtleſs is the firſt and primary object of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, and therefore all laws immediately affect every reſident in <hi>England</hi>; and of the king himſelf it has been ſaid, <hi>Rex Angliae in regno ſuo non habet ſuperiorem niſi Deum &amp; legem.</hi> Proceedings at law I take to be the ſame in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>England</hi>'s dependencies.</p>
            <p>SCOTLAND is united with <hi>England,</hi> and therefore there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent operation of the laws that ſubſiſted before and thoſe that have been made ſince the union, and even theſe do not affect <hi>Scotland</hi> as of themſelves; but in conſequence of and in the terms of the union between the two nations, the union makes no alteration in proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at law, nor does it take away any private property.</p>
            <p>IRELAND is a diſtinct kingdom, and hath been conquered from the native <hi>Iriſh</hi> two or three times by the <hi>Engliſh</hi>; it hath never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs a Parliament of its own, and is a part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire. It will beſt appear how far the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament think <hi>Ireland</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> by inſerting, <hi>A Bill for the better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing of the Dependency of</hi> Ireland. The act was as follows: Whereas attempts have lately been made to ſhake off the ſubjection of <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> unto, and dependence upon the imperial crown of this realm, which will be of dangerous conſequence to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi> And whereas the Houſe of Lords in <hi>Ireland,</hi> in order thereto, have, of late, againſt law, aſſumed to themſelves a power and juriſdiction to examine, correct and amend, the judgment and decrees of the courts of juſtice in the kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi>; therefore, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011542_0008_0F8725FD2011F9E8"/>
ſecuring of the dependency of <hi>Ireland</hi> upon the crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> may it pleaſe your Majeſty, that it may be enacted, and it is hereby declared and enacted, by the King's moſt excellent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, by and with the advice and conſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this preſent Parliament aſſembled, and by the authority of the ſame, That the ſaid kingdom of <hi>Ireland</hi> hath been, is, and of right ought to be, ſubordinate unto, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon the imperial crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as being inſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably united and annexed thereunto, and that the King's Majeſty, by and with the advice and conſent of the Lords Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral, and Commons of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in Parliament aſſembled, had, hath, and of right ought to have, full power and authority to make laws and ſtatutes of ſufficient force and validity to bind the people and kingdom of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And be it farther enacted, by the authority aforeſaid, That the Houſe of Lords of <hi>Ireland</hi> have not, nor of right ought to have, any juriſdiction to judge of, affirm, or reverſe any judgment, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, or decree, given or made in any court within the ſaid king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and that all proceedings before the Houſe of Lords upon any ſuch judgment, ſentence, or decree, are, and are hereby de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be utterly null and void to all intents and purpoſes what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of this bill was an appeal brought 1719 from the Houſe of Peers in <hi>Ireland</hi> to the Houſe of Peers in <hi>England.</hi> A PITT was the firſt that ſpoke againſt it in the Houſe of Commons, becauſe, as he ſaid, in his opinion it ſeemed calculated for no other purpoſe than to encreaſe the power of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Houſe of Peers, which in his opinion was already but too great. The Duke of <hi>Leeds</hi> proteſted againſt it in the Houſe of Lords, and gave fifteen reaſons to ſupport the claim of the Houſe of Peers in <hi>Ireland.</hi> The bill however paſſed, though Mr. <hi>Hungerford,</hi> Lord <hi>Moleſworth,</hi> Lord <hi>Tyrconel,</hi> and other members, endeavoured to ſhew, that <hi>Ireland</hi> was ever independent with reſpect to courts of judicature. Some propoſals have ſeveral years ago been made to incorporate <hi>Ireland</hi> with <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> but without any effect.</p>
            <p>The Iſlands of <hi>Guernſey</hi> and <hi>Jerſey</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though in eccleſiaſtical mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters conſidered as a part of <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> are under the direction of an Aſſembly called the Convention of the States of <hi>Jerſey, &amp;c.</hi> The <hi>Iſle of Man</hi> hath lately been annexed to the crown, but their own <hi>Manks</hi> laws ſtill obtain in the iſland.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Britiſh</hi> colonies and iſlands in <hi>America</hi> are not the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire; that theſe owe a conſtitutional dependence to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament I never heard they denied; though of late they have frequently been charged with it, theſe charges have not been grounded upon any declaration of theirs of the kind, their very petitioning, petitions and reſolutions, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011542_0009_0F8725FEA2023510"/>
ſpeaking the very reverſe; but their averſion to certain new duties, laid upon them for the ſole purpoſe of raiſing a revenue, have been made a handle of againſt them, and they have as good as been charged, that they declare themſelves an independent people. Theſe inſinuations the <hi>Americans</hi> are apt to look upon as being neither very fair nor very friendly; however at preſent I would only conſider what kind of dependence is expected from the <hi>American</hi> colonies. An act of Parliament has fixed that of <hi>Ireland</hi>; a later act of the ſame power hath alſo fixed that of <hi>America,</hi> though, as will appear from the compariſon, not altogether on the ſame footing. The act is entitled, <hi>An Act for the better ſecuring the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency of his Majeſty's Dominions in</hi> America <hi>upon the Crown and Parliament of</hi> Great-Britain, and runs thus:</p>
            <p>Whereas ſeveral of the Houſes of Repreſentatives in his Majeſty's colonies and plantations in <hi>America</hi> have of late, againſt law, claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to themſelves, or to the General Aſſemblies of the ſame, the ſole and excluſive right of impoſing duties and taxes upon his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſubjects in the ſaid colonies and plantations, and, in purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſuch claim, paſſed certain votes, reſolutions and orders, derogatory to the legiſlative authority of Parliament, and inconſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the dependency of the ſaid colonies and plantations upon the crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> may it therefore pleaſe your moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Majeſty, that it may be declared, and be it declared, by the King's moſt excellent Majeſty, by and with the advice and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in the preſent Parliament aſſembled, and by the authority of the ſame. That the ſaid colonies and plantations in <hi>America</hi> have been, are and of right ought to be, ſubordinate unto and dependent upon the imperial crown and Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and that the King's Majeſty, by and with the advice and conſent of the Lords Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Temporal, and Commons, of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in Parliament aſſembled, had, hath, and of right ought to have, full power and authority to make laws and ſtatutes of ſufficient force and validity to bind the colonies and people of <hi>America,</hi> ſubjects of the crown of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in all caſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>And be it further declared and enacted, by the authority afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, That all reſolutions, votes, orders and proceedings, in any of the ſaid colonies or plantations, whereby the power and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to make laws and ſtatutes as aforeſaid is denied, or drawn into queſtion, are, and are hereby declared to be utterly null and void to all intents and purpoſes whatſoever.</p>
            <p>This is the ſtandard of dependence which the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> hath fixed for the <hi>Britiſh</hi> colonies on the 18th of <hi>March,</hi> 1766. The Stamp Act was repealed the ſame day, and the opinion of ſeveral noblemen who proteſted againſt that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011542_0010_0F8725FF4D55F890"/>
was,
<q>that this declaratory bill cannot poſſibly obviate the growing miſchiefs in <hi>America,</hi> where it may ſeem calculated only to deceive the people of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> by holding forth a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive and nugatory affirmance of the legiſlative right of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> whilſt the enacting part of it does no more than abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the reſolutions of the Houſe of Repreſentatives in the <hi>North-American</hi> colonies, which have not in themſelves the leaſt colour of authority, and declares that which is apparently and certainly criminal only null and void.</q>
I preſume I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to affirm, that in and by this act, the Parliament did not mean to ſet aſide the conſtitution, infringe the liberties of <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, or to vindicate unto themſelves an authority which it had not before, was known to have, and would always have had, though this act had never been made. I alſo find, that, in order to overſet any act, law, reſolution, or proceeding, of the colony Aſſemblies, nothing ſeems neceſſary, but that the Parliament ſhould declare it null and void to all intents and purpoſes whatſoever. And it ſeems pretty clear, that the ſame power that can diſannul any act by a ſimple declaration, with one ſingle ſtroke more, can alſo annihilate the body that made it.</p>
            <p>The remark already made, that though all the different parts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire are in a ſtate of dependence upon the Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> yet that the nature and degree of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is not exactly alike in the reſpective different parts of the ſame, will receive new ſtrength and light, if we compare the act for better ſecuring the dependency of <hi>Ireland</hi> with that for better ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the dependency of the colonies. Both acts, though at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times, have been made by the ſame authority, and for a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar purpoſe, and none can better tell us what kind and degree of dependency the Parliament expects and requires of its depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents than the Parliament itſelf.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Iriſh</hi> is entitled in very general words, for the better ſecuring the dependency of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The title of the <hi>American</hi> law is more explicit; <hi>Ireland</hi>'s depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency is mentioned, but the dependency of the <hi>Americans</hi> is more clearly expreſſed, and ſaid to be upon the crown and Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain. America</hi> ſeems to owe two dependencies, one to the crown, and one to the Parliament.</p>
            <p>The preamble of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> bill brings no leſs a charge than an attempt to ſhake off ſubjection unto and dependence upon the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial crown of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preamble of the <hi>American</hi> bill brings no ſuch accuſation, but only, that the <hi>Americans</hi> have claimed an excluſive right to lay on taxes on his Majeſty's ſubjects within the colonies, and paſſed votes and reſolutions derogatory to the legiſlative power of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and inconſiſtent with the dependency of the ſaid colonies
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011542_0011_0F8726049E2A0FA8"/>
and plantations upon the crown (the word and Parliament is not made uſe of in this place) of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> The principal diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences between theſe bills ſeems to me to lie in this, that <hi>Ireland</hi> is ſaid to be ſubject to and dependent only on the crown of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> whereas <hi>America</hi> throughout is declared ſubject, at leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent and ſubordinate, not only to the crown, but alſo to the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and then <hi>Ireland</hi> is only declared de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent upon, and ſubordinate to, in very gentle terms, whereas the right of making laws to bind the <hi>Americans</hi> is expreſſed in theſe very ſtrong, moſt extenſive terms, IN ALL CASES WHATSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EVER.</p>
            <p>Time was when the dependency of the colonies upon <hi>England</hi> was ſpoke of exactly in the terms made uſe of for <hi>Ireland</hi>; the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this province ſaith, "our pleaſure is, that the tenants and inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the ſaid province be ſubject IMMEDIATELY to the crown of <hi>England,</hi> as depending thereof forever;" but by the late law all <hi>America</hi> is ſaid to be dependent on crown and Parliament. This alteration ſeems to me by no means immaterial, but to imply a change both in the ſubjection expected from the colony and in the authority to which the colony owes dependency and ſubordination. In Parliament, King, Lords, and Commons, conſtitute the ſupreme power; but as each of theſe has its own diſtinct unalienable right, and incommunicable prerogatives, rights, or privileges, ſo I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but conceive dependency upon the crown and dependency upon crown and Parliament are things not exactly alike. If (as aſſerted in the charter) the colonies at ſome time or other were only depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the crown, and now are ſubordinate unto and dependent upon crown and Parliament, it ſhould ſeem both the authority on which they depend, and the nature of their dependency, hath un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone ſome alteration; neither doth this appear to me a trifling alteration, and it ſeems to me at leaſt if ſo it muſt needs make ſome alteration in the ſyſtem of government and obebience.</p>
            <p>Hitherto all appeals from the colonies, after paſſing thro' chancery in <hi>America,</hi> have been made to the King in council; this I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive muſt have been in conſequence of the dependency of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies immediately upon the crown; but perhaps for the future appeals will not be carried to the King in council, but to the King and Parliament.</p>
            <p>The crown has hitherto had a right of a negative upon all <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> laws, and they were obliged to be paſſed in <hi>America</hi> with a ſaving clauſe; but if, as is aſſerted in the declaratory bill, the King has a right and power to make laws to bind the <hi>Americans, by and with the advice and conſent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons of</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>aſſembled in Parliament,</hi> then probably the ſame authority muſt alſo concur to repeal the laws made in <hi>America,</hi> whereas the crown hitherto repealed any law made in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:011542_0012_0F872605E79C7120"/>
without aſking or waiting for the conſent of Lords and Commons.</p>
            <p>It appears alſo, by a late act ſuſpending the Aſſembly of <hi>New-York,</hi> that the parliamentary authority alſo extends to ſuſpend, which is but another word for proroguing or diſſolving (or annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating) Aſſemblies; all which has hitherto been done by the crown without the interfering of Parliament: But that the crown hath a right of proroguing or diſſolving the Parliament itſelf by its own authority I ſuppoſe will not be denied. I cannot diſmiſs this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject without obſerving, that even the declaratory bill ſpeaks of the Aſſemblies in <hi>America</hi> as Houſes of Repreſentatives. If it is allowed that they are repreſented in <hi>America,</hi> unleſs they are repreſented doubly, they cannot be repreſented any where elſe; this ſtrikes at the root of virtual repreſentation, and if repreſentation is the baſis of taxation, they cannot be taxed but where they are repreſented, unleſs they are doubly taxed, as well as doubly repreſented.</p>
            <p>It is evident upon the whole, that a much greater degree of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency and ſubordination is expected of <hi>America</hi> than of <hi>Ireland,</hi> though, by the way, <hi>Ireland,</hi> in the preamble of their bill, is charged with much greater guilt than <hi>America</hi>; nay, the words in ALL CASES WHATSOEVER are ſo exceeding extenſive, that, in proceſs of time, even hewing of wood, and drawing of water, might be argued to be included in them.</p>
            <p>It was neceſſary to ſtate the authority claimed by Parliament over <hi>America</hi> as clear and full as poſſible; with regard to the <hi>Americans</hi> it muſt be owned, when they profeſs to owe dependency and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, they do not mean ſo extenſive and abſolute a dependency as here ſeems to be claimed, but that they think themſelves in a conſtitutional manner dependent upon and in ſubordination to the crown and Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> even thoſe votes, reſolutions, and proceedings, which are diſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled by the Houſe of Commons and the declaratory bill, moſt fully and chearfully declare.</p>
            <p>It has indeed been ſaid, that unleſs they are ſubject to all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> acts in which they are mentioned, they are ſubject to none of any kind whatſoever, and conſequently to be conſidered as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of the legal and parliamentary power of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; but I ſhould think it might be as fairly and ſafely concluded, that while the <hi>Americans</hi> declare themſelves ſubject to any one law of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> legiſlature, it cannot be ſaid they declare themſelves inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, or not ſubject to any law whatever.</p>
            <p>In ſo delicate and important a matter, may I be permitted to obſerve, that the meaſure of power and of obedience in every coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try muſt be determined by the ſtandard of its conſtitution. The diſpute ſeems to lie between the Parliament and colonies; the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament will certainly be the ſitting judges; I will not take upon
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011542_0013_0F872607A66A9C28"/>
me to ſay that the <hi>Americans</hi> may not look upon Parliament as judge and party; however, it is very poſſible for a judge to give a moſt righteous ſentence, even where he himſelf is deeply intereſted, but they that are ſufferers by the ſentence will ever be apt to wiſh that he had not been party as well as judge.</p>
            <p>From what hath been ſaid hitherto, the due and conſtitutional authority of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament appears clear, and it does not leſs ſo I hope, that the ſubordination to and dependency on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament is not exactly the ſame in all the reſpective parts of that extenſive empire; perhaps this will appear with ſtill greater evidence by taking a particular view of the ſubject of taxation.</p>
            <p>Any unlimited power and authority may lay on the ſubjects any tax it pleaſeth; the ſubjects in that caſe themſelves are mere pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and doubtleſs their ſubſtance and labour muſt be at their diſpoſal who have the diſpoſal of their perſons. This is the caſe in arbitrary governments; but the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire is an empire of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, no power is abſolute but that of the laws, and, as hath been aſſerted, of ſuch laws to which they that are bound by them have themſelves conſented.</p>
            <p>Did the power and authority of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament in point of taxation extend in the ſame manner over all its dependencies, <hi>e. g.</hi> the ſame over <hi>Scotland</hi> as over <hi>England,</hi> over <hi>Ireland</hi> in the ſame manner as over <hi>Scotland,</hi> over <hi>Guernſey</hi> and <hi>Jerſey</hi> as over <hi>Ireland, &amp;c.</hi> then the very ſame act which lays a general tax would lay it alſo at the ſame time upon all over whom that authority extends. The laws of every legiſlature are ſuppoſed to extend to and be made over all within their juriſdiction, unleſs they are expreſsly excepted. Thus an exciſe law extends to all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> kingdom, becauſe it is a publick law; but acts have frequently been made to lay on a penny <hi>Scots</hi> on beer, which, being for a local purpoſe, cannot operate on the whole kingdom. The ſame I believe may be ſaid with regard to the method of recovering ſmall debts; it ſeems abſurd to ſay, that any ſupreme legiſlature makes an unlimited law which at the ſame time is deſigned not to be binding upon the greateſt part of the ſubjects within that empire. Was it ever known that the land tax being laid on the whole united kingdom, the biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> and the manor of <hi>Eaſt-Greenwich,</hi> were not alſo ſuppoſed to be included? and if any part within the immediate juriſdiction, and equally dependent on the ſame legiſlature, ſhould be deſigned to be excuſed from, or not liable to pay a general tax, would it not be abſolutely neceſſary that ſuch a place ſhould be expreſsly except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? If, becauſe <hi>America</hi> is a part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, it is as much ſo, or in the ſame manner is a part of it, as is the biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> or the manor of <hi>Eaſt-Greenwich,</hi> nothing can be plainer than that it muſt be affected by every tax that is laid juſt in the ſame manner and proportion as is the biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> or manor
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:011542_0014_0F872608551EA590"/>
               <hi>Eaſt-Greenwich.</hi> This hath not been the caſe, nor thought to be the caſe hitherto. <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>America</hi> have not been called upon to pay the <hi>Britiſh</hi> land tax, malt tax, nor indeed any tax in which they have not been expreſsly mentioned; the reaſon of which I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume muſt be, either that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament did not look upon them as any part of the kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> or elſe did not think them liable to any tax in which they were not expreſsly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. If any ſubjects of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire are not liable to any or every tax laid on by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, it muſt be either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not liable by the conſtitution, (as not being repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented) or becauſe they are excuſed by the favour of Parliament; if they are not liable by the privileges of the conſtitution, their not being compelled to pay is no favour, the contrary would be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and an anticonſtitutional act; if they have been hitherto excuſed by the lenity of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, it muſt be owned the Parliament bore harder on thoſe who were made to pay thoſe taxes than on thoſe who by their lenity only were excuſed.</p>
            <p>The noble Lords who proteſted againſt the repeal of the Stamp Act obſerve,
<q>it appears to us, that a moſt eſſential part of that authority, (<hi>ſc.</hi> the whole legiſlative authority of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> without any diſtinction or reſerve whatſoever) the power of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation, cannot be properly, equitably, or impartially exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if it does not extend itſelf to all the members of the ſtate in proportion to their reſpective abilities, but ſuffers a part to be exempt from a due ſhare of thoſe burdens which the publick exigencies require to be impoſed upon the whole: A partiality which is directly and manifeſtly repugnant to the truſt repoſed by the people in every legiſlature, and deſtructive of that confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on which all government is founded.</q>
            </p>
            <p>If in the opinion of theſe Noblemen, therefore, it is partiality to ſuffer any part of the ſtate to be exempt from a due ſhare of thoſe burdens which the publick exigencies require ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon the WHOLE, it would alſo ſeem to be a ſpecies of partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, to lay a burden on ANY PART of the ſtate which the other parts of the ſame ſtate are not equally bound to bear. Partial burdens, or partial exemptions, would doubtleſs affect thoſe that are bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened or exempted in a very different manner; but if not extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alike to the whole, muſt ſtill be looked upon as partial. And if this partiality is inconſiſtent with the truſt <hi>repoſed BY THE PEOPLE in every legiſlature,</hi> it would alſo ſeem that the legiſlature could not lay any burdens but as entruſted by the people who choſe them to be their repreſentatives and a part of the legiſlature. We may hence alſo learn what is to be expected, if every other part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> only excepted, have hitherto been exempted from the taxes paid in <hi>England,</hi> which it muſt be owned are very heavy, by mere favour; or, as ſome ſeem to expreſs
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011542_0015_0F87260944D457E8"/>
it, "<hi>flagrant partiality and injuſtice</hi>;" their being indulged time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorial will not be deemed a ſufficient plea to excuſe them al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, but with an impartial hand the very ſame taxes that now ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will be laid upon <hi>Ireland, America, Jerſey, Guernſey,</hi> the <hi>Mediterranean, African</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> ſettlements, and, in ſhort, on every individual part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a deſign to do this be not ripening apace I will not take upon me to ſay, but whenever it does, it muſt make ſome alteration in the policy of the mother and infant ſtate, nay in the ſyſtem of the whole <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral parts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire that pay no tax at all; this I take to be the caſe of <hi>Gibraltar, Minorca, Newfoundland, Eaſt-Florida,</hi> and all the <hi>African</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> ſettlements, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The reaſon is, that all theſe places have no legiſlature of their own, and conſequently none to give or diſpoſe of their property; had theſe places been taxed by Parliament, there might however this reaſon been given, that having no repreſentatives within themſelves, and having never contributed any thing to the publick burdens, though they all receive protection, perhaps greater than the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> colonies, the Parliament ſupplied that detect; but this cannot be urged againſt the colonies, who both have legiſlatures, and alſo contributed to the publick burdens, and that ſo liberally, that even the crown and Parliament thought they had exerted themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their abilities, and for ſeveral years gave them ſome compenſation. I may mention thoſe parts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire as ſtriking inſtances, that where there is no repreſentation, taxation hath not been thought of, and yet <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> which is not taxed at all, is certainly as much repreſented in Parliament as all the colonies, which are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to be doubly taxed.</p>
            <p>By the conſtitution taxes are in the nature of a free gift of the ſubjects to the crown; regulations of trade are meaſures to ſecure and improve the trade of the whole nation. There is no doubt but regulations may be made to ruin as well as to improve trade; yet without regulations trade cannot ſubſiſt, but muſt ſuffer and ſink; and it ſeems no where more proper to lodge the power of making theſe regulations than in the higheſt court of the empire; yet a man may trade or not, he may buy or let it alone; if merchandizes are rated ſo high that they will not ſuit him to purchaſe, though it may be an inconvenience, yet there is no law to compel him to buy; to rate the neceſſaries of life, without which a man cannot well do, beyond their real value, and hinder him at the ſame time from pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing them reaſonably of others, is ſcarce conſiſtent with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but when duties are laid on merchandizes not to regulate trade, but for the expreſs and ſole purpoſe of raiſing a revenue, they are to all intents and purpoſes equal to any tax, but they can
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011542_0016_0F872609F632AA10"/>
by no means be called the free gift of thoſe who never helped to make the law, but, as far as in them lay, ever looked upon it as an unconſtitutional grievance.</p>
            <p>If taxes are a free GIFT of the people to the crown, then the crown hath no right to them but what is derived from the GIVERS. It may be abſolutely neceſſary that the ſubject ſhould give, but ſtill he that is to give muſt be ſuppoſed the judge both of that neceſſity, and how much he may be able and ought to give upon every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary occaſion. No man can give what is not his own, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the conſtitution hath placed this right to judge of the neceſſity, and of what is to be given, in the Commons as the repreſentatives of all thoſe who are to give, in veſting a right in them to give pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſupplies to the crown; it did not, could not mean to inveſt them with any power to give what neither belongs to them, nor thoſe whom they repreſent; and therefore, as no man conſtitutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally "owes obedience to any law to which he has not aſſented either in perſon or by his repreſentative;" much leſs doth the conſtitution oblige any man to part with his property, but freely and by his own conſent; what thoſe who are repreſentatives are not willing to give, no power in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> hath any right violently to take, and for a man to have his property took from him under pretence of a law that is not conſtitutional, would not be much better than to have it took from him againſt the expreſs conſent of thoſe whom he conſtitutionally made his repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>It is held a maxim, that in government a proportion ought to be obſerved between the ſhare in the legiſlature and the burden to be borne. The <hi>Americans</hi> pretend to no ſhare in the legiſlature of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> at all, but they hope they have never forfeited their ſhare in the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>Every government ſuppoſes rule and protection from the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, ſupport and obedience from thoſe that are governed; from theſe duly tempered ariſes the prerogative of the crown and the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the ſubject; but he that has not a right to his own hath no property, and he that muſt part with his property by laws againſt his conſent, or the conſent of the majority of the people, has no liberty. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution is made to ſecure liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; whatever takes away theſe takes away the conſtitution it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and cannot be conſtitutional.</p>
            <p>To form a clear judgment on the power of taxation, it muſt be enquired on what right that power is grounded. It is a fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal maxim of <hi>Engliſh</hi> law, that there is a contract between the crown and ſubjects; if ſo, the crown cannot lay on any tax, or any other burden, on the ſubject, but agreeable to the original contract by authority of Parliament; neither can the Lords properly concur, or the Commons frame a tax bill for any other purpoſe but the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011542_0017_0F87260AAE869D30"/>
of the crown and government, conſiſtent with the original contract between that and the people.</p>
            <p>All ſubjects are dependent on and ſubordinate to the government under which they live. An <hi>Engliſhman</hi> in <hi>France</hi> muſt obſerve the laws of <hi>France</hi>; but it cannot be ſaid that the dependency and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordination in <hi>England</hi> is the ſame as dependency and ſubordination in <hi>France.</hi> In governments where the will of the ſovereign is the ſupreme law, the ſubjects have nothing to give, their ALL is in the diſpoſal of the government; there ſubjects pay, but having nothing of their own cannot give; but in <hi>England</hi> the Commons GIVE and GRANT. This implies both a free and voluntary act, and that they give nothing but their own property.</p>
            <p>Though every part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire is bound to ſupport and promote the advantage of the whole, it is by no means neceſſary that this ſhould be done by a tax indiſcriminately laid on the whole; it ſeems ſufficient that every part ſhould contribute to the ſupport of the whole as it may be beſt able, and as may beſt ſuit with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſtitution.</p>
            <p>I have before obſerved the different degree of dependency on the mother ſtate; I ſhall now review the ſame again, with a particular regard to impoſing or paying taxes, and if a material difference hath always obtained in this reſpect, it will confirm my aſſertion, that every branch of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire is not affected by the tax laws of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> in the ſelf ſame manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Parliament has a right to tax,</hi> but this right is not inherent in the members of it as men; I mean, the members of Parliament are not (like the Senate of <hi>Venice</hi>) ſo many rulers who have each of them a native and inherent right to be the rulers of the people of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> or even their repreſentatives; they do not meet together as a court of proprietors to conſider their common intereſt, and agree with one another what tax they will lay on thoſe over whom they bear rule, or whom they repreſent, but they only exerciſe that right which nature hath placed in the people in general, and which, as it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conveniently be exerciſed by the whole people, THESE have lodged in ſome of their body choſen from among themſelves, and by themſelves, for that purpoſe, and empowered for a time only to tranſact the affairs of the whole, and to agree in their behalf on ſuch ſupplies as it may be neceſſary to furniſh unto the crown for the ſupport of its dignity, and the neceſſities and protection of the people.</p>
            <p>It would be abſurd to ſay, that the crown hath a right to lay on a tax, for as taxes are granted to the crown, ſo in this caſe the crown would make a grant to itſelf, and hence the bill of rights expreſsly aſſerts, that <hi>the levying of money for or to the uſe of the crown, by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of prerogative, without grant of Parliament, for a longer time or
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011542_0018_0F87260B51EB8640"/>
in any other manner than the ſame is or ſhall be granted, is illegal</hi>; hence alſo there is a material difference between money bills and all other laws. The King and Lords cannot make any amendment in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney bills, as the Houſe of Lords frequently doth in all others, but muſt accept or refuſe them ſuch as they are offered by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the conſtitutional reaſon of which is very obvious, it is the people only that give, and therefore giving muſt be the ſole act of thoſe by whom the givers are repreſented. The crown cannot take till it is given, and they that give cannot give but on their own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, and of thoſe whom they repreſent; nay even then they cannot give but in a conſtitutional manner; they cannot give the property of thoſe they repreſent without giving their own alſo exactly in the ſame proportion; every bill muſt be equally binding upon ALL whom they repreſent, and upon every one that is a repreſentative.</p>
            <p>Every repreſentative in Parliament is not a repreſentative for the whole nation, but only for the particular place for which he hath been choſen. If any are choſen for a plurality of places, they can make their election only for one of them. The electors of <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex</hi> cannot chuſe a repreſentative but for <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and as the right of ſitting depends entirely upon the election, it ſeems clear to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that no member can repreſent any but thoſe by whom he hath been elected; if not elected he cannot repreſent them, and of courſe not conſent to any thing in their behalf. While <hi>Great-Britain</hi>'s repreſentatives do not ſit aſſembled in Parliament, no tax whatever can be laid by any power on <hi>Great-Britain</hi>'s inhabitants; it is plain therefore, that without repreſentation there can be no taxation. If repreſentation ariſes entirely from the free election of the people, it is plain that the elected are not repreſentatives in their own right, but by virtue of their election; and it is not leſs ſo, that the electors cannot confer any right on thoſe whom they elect but what is inherent in themſelves; the electors of <hi>London</hi> cannot confer or give any right to their members to lay a tax on <hi>Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> but the election made of them doubtleſs empowers them to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to or differ from any meaſures they think agreeable or diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their conſtituents, or the kingdom in general. If the repreſentatives have no right but what they derive from their elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors and election, and if the electors have no right to elect any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives but for themſelves, and if the right of ſitting in the Houſe of Commons ariſes only from the election of thoſe deſigned to be repreſentatives, it is undeniable, that the power of taxation in the Houſe of Commons cannot extend any further than to thoſe who have delegated them for that purpoſe; and if none of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors in <hi>England</hi> could give a power to thoſe whom they elected to repreſent or tax any other part of his Majeſty's dominions except themſelves, it muſt follow, that when the Commons are met, they repreſent no other place or part of his Majeſty's dominions, and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011542_0019_0F87260C1571E9F8"/>
cannot give away the property but of thoſe who have given them a power ſo to do by chooſing them their repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>The Parliament hath the ſole right to lay on taxes, and, as hath been obſerved in Parliament, 'tis not the King and Lords that GIVE and GRANT, but this is the ſole act of the Commons. The Commons have the right to do ſo either from the crown or people, or it is a right inherent in themſelves. It cannot be inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in themſelves, for they are not born repreſentatives, but are ſo by election, and that not for life, but only for a certain time; neither can they derive it from the crown, elſe the liberty and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the ſubject muſt be entirely in the diſpoſal and poſſeſſion of the crown; but if they hold it entirely from the people, they cannot hold it from any other people but thoſe who have choſen them to be their repreſentatives, and it ſhould ſeem they cannot extend their power of taxing beyond the limits of time and place, nor indeed for any other purpoſe but that for which they have been choſen. As the Commons in Parliament cannot lay any tax but what they muſt pay themſelves, and falls equally on the whole kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> ſo, by a fundamental law, they cannot lay but ſuch a part of the general tax on ſome part of the united king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The principality of <hi>Wales</hi> was never taxed by Parliament till it was incorporated and repreſented, and, poor as it is, it pays now conſiderably larger than <hi>Scotland,</hi> which is as big again. When <hi>England</hi> is taxed two millions in the land tax, no more is paid in <hi>Scotland</hi> than 48,000<hi>l.</hi> and yet to lay a higher land tax on <hi>North Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament cannot, it cannot without breaking the union, that is, a fundamental law of the kingdom. All the right it hath to tax <hi>Scotland</hi> ariſes from and muſt be executed in the terms of the union. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>While <hi>Scotland</hi> was yet a ſeparate kingdom, it was once debated in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whether a ſubſidy ſhould firſt be granted, or overtures for liberty firſt be conſidered; when the Queen's Miniſtry inſiſted on the former, a member urged, that it was now plain the nation was to expect no return for their expence and toil, but to be put to the charge of a ſubſidy, and to lay down their necks under the yoke of ſlavery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Another member ſaid, that he inſiſted for having a vote upon the queſtion which had been put: That he found as the liberties of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were ſuppreſſed, ſo the privileges of Parliament were like to be torn from them, but that he would rather venture his life than that it ſhould be ſo, and ſhould chuſe rather <hi>to die a freeman</hi> than <hi>live a ſlave.</hi> Some preſſed for the vote, adding, that if there was no other way of obtaining ſo natural and undeniable a privilege of the Parliament, <hi>they would demand it with their ſwords in their hands.</hi>

               <hi>Ireland</hi> is a conquered kingdom, the greater part of its inhabitants <hi>Papiſts,</hi> who in <hi>England</hi> pay double tax. The <hi>Romans</hi> always made a difference between their colonies and their conqueſts, and as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, allowed greater and indeed all common liberties to the former. <hi>Ireland</hi> hath been conquered twice again upon the natives ſince its firſt conqueſt, nevertheleſs it hitherto had its own legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature; if the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> claims a right to tax them, they never yet have made uſe of that right, and ſeeing for ages paſt they enjoyed the privilege of having their own property diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by repreſentatives in a Parliament of their own, it is very natural to ſuppoſe, that they think themſelves entitled to theſe things, and the more ſo, becauſe, in the very bill that determines their dependency, they are not ſaid to be dependent on the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, nor yet on crown and Parliament, but only on the crown of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would now proceed to take a diſtinct view of the point in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her colonies.</p>
            <p>It ſeems to be a prevailing opinion in <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that the Parliament hath a right to tax the <hi>Americans,</hi> and that, unleſs they have ſo, <hi>America</hi> would be independent of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And it ſeems to be a prevailing opinion in <hi>America,</hi> that to be taxed without their conſent, and where they are not and cannot be repreſented, would deprive them of the rights of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> nay, in time, with the loſs of the conſtitution, would deprive them of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and property altogether.</p>
            <p>It is eaſily ſeen, that this is a very intereſting ſubject, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences in each caſe very important, though in neither ſo alarming and dangerous to <hi>Britain</hi> as to <hi>America.</hi> With regard to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> if it ſhould not prove ſo as is claimed, the conſequence can only be this, that then no tax can be laid, or revenue be raiſed, on the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans,</hi> but where they are repreſented, and in a manner which they think conſiſtent with their natural rights as men, and with their civil and conſtitutional liberties as <hi>Britons.</hi> The dependency of <hi>America</hi> upon <hi>Great-Britain</hi> will be as full and firm as ever, and they will chearfully comply with the requiſitions of the crown in a conſtitutional manner. The queſtion is not, whether the <hi>Americans</hi> will withdraw their ſubordination, or refuſe their aſſiſtance, but, whether they themſelves ſhall give their own property, where they are legally repreſented, or, whether the Parliament of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> which does not repreſent them, ſhall take their property, and diſpoſe of it in the ſame manner as they do theirs whom in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they actually repreſent. The <hi>Americans</hi> do not plead for a right to withhold, but freely and chearfully to give. If 100,000<hi>l.</hi> are to be raiſed, the queſtion is not, ſhall they be raiſed or no? but ſhall the Parliament levy ſo much upon the <hi>Americans,</hi> and order
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011542_0021_0F8A2013B73550E8"/>
them to pay it, as a gift and grant of the Commons of <hi>Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> to the King? or, ſhall the <hi>Americans</hi> alſo have an opportunity to ſhew their loyalty and readineſs to ſerve the King by freely grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the King themſelves? It is not to be denied the <hi>Americans</hi> apprehend, that if any power, no matter what the name, where they are not repreſented, hath a right to lay a tax on them at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, all their liberty and property is at an end, and they are upon a level with the meaneſt ſlaves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>England</hi> will not loſe a ſhilling in point of property; the rights and privileges of the good people of <hi>Britain</hi> will not be in the leaſt affected, ſuppoſing the claim of the <hi>Americans</hi> juſt and to take place; whereas every thing dreadful appears in view to the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> if it ſhould turn out otherwiſe. The crown cannot loſe; the <hi>Americans</hi> are as willing to comply with every conſtitutional requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition as the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament itſelf can poſſibly be. The Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cannot loſe, it will ſtill have all the power and authority it hitherto had, and ought to have had, and when every branch of the legiſlature, and every member of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, has a true regard to reciprocal duty, prerogative and privilege, the happineſs of the whole is beſt likely to be ſecured and promoted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Americans</hi> moſt ſolemnly diſclaim every thought, and the very idea of independency; they are ſometimes afraid they are charged with a deſire of it, not becauſe this appears to be the real caſe, but to ſet their arguments in an invidious light, and to make them appear odious in the ſight of their mother country. This is not a diſpute about a punctilio, the difference in the conſequence is amazingly great; ſuppoſing <hi>America</hi> is not taxed where not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, and ſuppoſing things are left upon the ſame footing in which with manifeſt advantage to <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>America</hi> they have been ever ſince <hi>Britain</hi> had colonies, neither the trade nor authority of <hi>Britain</hi> ſuffers the leaſt diminution, but the miſchief to the colonies is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all expreſſion, if the contrary ſhould take place. If they are not to raiſe their own taxes, all their Aſſemblies become uſeleſs in a moment, all their reſpective legiſlatures are annihilated at a ſtroke; an act paſſed by perſons, moſt of whom probably never ſaw, nor cared much for <hi>America,</hi> may deſtroy all the acts they ever paſſed, may lay every burden upon them under which they are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected immediately to ſink, and all their civil and religious liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, for which their forefathers went into this wilderneſs, and, under the ſmiles of Heaven, turned it into a garden, and of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe conſequence to the mother country, will, or may be at an end at once. Probably the preſent Parliament or generation would never carry matters to this length, but who knows what might be done in the next? The firſt ſettlers of the <hi>American</hi> wilds never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that would come to paſs what we have ſeen already. It ſeems as if ſome evil genius had prevailed of late; had theſe new
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011542_0022_0F87260ED9598080"/>
duties been laid on payable in <hi>England,</hi> at leaſt the expence of a Board of Commiſſioners, and of the ſwarms of new officers, might have been prevented; but it looks as though ſome men wiſhed that <hi>America</hi> might not only be borne hard upon, but alſo be made to know and feel that their liberty and property lay at the mercy of others, and that they muſt not flatter themſelves to enjoy them any longer than the good pleaſure of ſome who would willingly take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way what <hi>they</hi> never did give. I have endeavoured candidly to ſtate the queſtion, let us now endeavour to view the claim made on each ſide as calmly and impartially as poſſible.</p>
            <p>'Tis ſaid the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament hath a right to tax the <hi>Americans.</hi> If this propoſition is incontrovertible, it muſt certainly be built on ſuch a baſis and ſuch clear principles as will be ſufficient to diſpoſe loyal and reaſonable men chearfully to acquieſce in it. There are ſome points in government which perhaps are beſt never touched upon, but when any queſtion once becomes the ſubject of publick debate, ſtrength of reaſon is the ſole authority that with men of reaſon can determine the matter.</p>
            <p>If the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> have a right to tax the <hi>Americans,</hi> it muſt either be the ſame right in virtue of which they have a right to tax <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and be veſted in them by the ſame power, or it muſt be a diſtinct right either inherent in themſelves, or veſted in them by ſome other power.</p>
            <p>The right of the Commons of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to lay on taxes ariſes, as I conceive, from their having been choſen by the people who are to pay theſe taxes to act in their behalf and as their repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. There may be other qualifications neceſſary, that a man be a <hi>Briton</hi> born, ſubject of the King, poſſeſſed of a certain eſtate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but none is ſo abſolutely neceſſary as election. He that hath been a repreſentative had a right to refuſe or concur in any tax bill whilſt a member, but if he is not choſen again in a following Parliament, he hath no right whatever to meddle in the matter; this proves that the power is originally in the people, and the legiſlative capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the whole Houſe, and of every member, depends upon their free election, and is of force no longer than for the time for which they have been elected; this being elapſed, the truſt repoſed in them entirely ceaſes, it abſolutely returns to the body of the people; in that interval during which the people are unrepreſented, any power their representatives might have is entirely and ſolely in the people themſelves, no tax can be laid on, nor any law to bind the people be formed, for this plain reaſon, becauſe there are no perſons qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the purpoſe. The people have not repreſentatives aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but chuſe them, and being ſo choſen, the rights of the people reſide now in them, and they may, but not before, act in their behalf. Now, when the crown iſſues writs of election, it is not to
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:011542_0023_0F87260F62637B68"/>
empower the electors to chuſe repreſentatives for <hi>America,</hi> nor yet for all <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> but only for ſome certain place ſpecified in the writ; and when the electors of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> chuſe repreſentatives, their meaning alſo is not to chuſe repreſentatives for their fellow ſubjects in <hi>America,</hi> or any where elſe, but for themſelves. In <hi>Great-Britain Engliſh</hi> electors cannot elect in behalf of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> electors cannot in behalf of <hi>England</hi>; and for the ſame reaſon neither <hi>Scotch</hi> nor <hi>Engliſh</hi> can elect any for <hi>America.</hi> Theſe electors do not repreſent the <hi>Americans,</hi> nor are they their proxies to vote in members in their behalf; neither can <hi>Britiſh</hi> electors give any inſtructions to <hi>Britiſh</hi> repreſentatives, or inveſt them with any power to diſpoſe of the rights and property of any of their fellow ſubjects without the kingdom of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> It ſeems not unreaſonable then to conclude, that the right which the elected acquire by their election to paſs tax laws binding upon their electors does not at the ſame time give them a right to repreſent and lay on taxes on thoſe who never inveſted them with any ſuch power, and by whom they neither were nor could be elected. If the <hi>Americans</hi> themſelves are not received as voters in the biſhoprick of <hi>Durham,</hi> manor of <hi>Eaſt Greenwich,</hi> or any place mentioned in their charters, and the ſame liberty and privileges with thoſe places therein ſecured unto them, if they are not allowed to chuſe any repreſentatives for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Houſe of Commons, it ſeems natural, that what they have no right to do themſelves, none can have a right to do for them, and ſo no body can chuſe or ſend a repreſentative for them to any place where they are not allowed to ſit or be repreſented. If ſo, the electors of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> never in fact elected repreſentatives for <hi>America,</hi> nor could theſe electors poſſibly convey any power to give away property where they have no property themſelves. The electors do not repreſent <hi>America,</hi> neither their repreſentatives by them elected; the electors cannot diſpoſe of the property of <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> therefore they cannot give a power ſo to do unto others. In <hi>England</hi> there can be no taxation without repreſentation, and no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation without election; but it is undeniable that the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> are not elected by nor for the <hi>Americans,</hi> and therefore cannot repreſent them; and ſo, if the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has a right to tax <hi>America,</hi> that right cannot poſſibly be grounded on the conſideration that the people of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> have choſen them their repreſentatives, without which choice they would be no Parliament at all.</p>
            <p>If the Parliament of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has a right to tax the <hi>Americans</hi> diſtinct from the right which they derive from their electors, and which they exerciſe as the repreſentatives of the people of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> then this right they muſt hold either from the crown, or from the <hi>Americans,</hi> or elſe it muſt be a native inherent right in
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011542_0024_0F87260FD9876680"/>
themſelves, at leaſt a conſequence of their being repreſentatives of the people of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is plain that the colonies have been ſettled by authority and under the ſanction of the crown, but as the crown did not reſerve unto itſelf a right to rule over them without their own Aſſemblies, but on the contrary eſtabliſhed legiſlatures among them, as it did not reſerve a right to lay taxes on them in a manner which, were the experiment made in <hi>England,</hi> might be thought unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional, ſo neither do I find that a reſerve of that kind was made by the crown in favour of the Parliament, on the contrary, by the charters all the inhabitants were promiſed the enjoyment of the ſame and all privileges of his Majeſty's liege ſubjects in <hi>England,</hi> of which doubtleſs not to be taxed where they are not repreſented is one of the principal. As to any right that might accrue to Parliament from any act or ſurrender of the <hi>Americans,</hi> I believe it hath never been thought of; they have a profound veneration for the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, they look upon it as the great palladium of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> liberties, but ſtill they are not theſe repreſented, they have had their own legiſlatures and repreſentatives for ages paſt, and as a body cannot be more than in one place at once, they think they cannot be legally repreſented in more than one legiſlative body, but alſo think, that by the laws of <hi>England Proteſtants</hi> ought not to be doubly taxed, or, what they think worſe, taxed in two places.</p>
            <p>If therefore this right of taxing the <hi>Americans</hi> reſides in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> at all, it muſt be an inherent right in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or at leaſt in conſequence of their being repreſentatives of the people of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> The act for better ſecuring the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of the colonies, which I have inſerted at large, evidently ſeems to tend this way. That the colonies were thought at the diſpoſal of Parliament one might be led to think, becauſe by that act, from the ſimple authority of the crown, which they were till then ſubject to by their charters, they were now declared to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate to and dependent (on the joint authority) of crown and Parliament. Yet, concerning this act, I would only obſerve, that however it may determine the caſe from that day, it cannot be the ground on which the ſubordination of the colonies originally WAS or now can be built; for it declares not only, that the colonies ARE AND OUGHT TO BE, but alſo that they ALWAYS HAVE BEEN, ſubject to crown and Parliament. A law binds after it is made, it cannot bind before it exiſts, and ſo ſurely it cannot be ſaid, that the colonies have <hi>always</hi> been bound by a law which is above a hundred years poſterior to them in point of exiſtence. It is alſo a little difficult to reconcile this law with prior charters; our <hi>Carolina</hi> charter makes our province ſubject immediately to the crown, and near a hundred years after a law is made to declare, that this was
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011542_0025_0F8726109DD8B388"/>
not and muſt not be the caſe, but that the <hi>Americans</hi> always were and ought to be ſubject to crown and Parliament. Perhaps this hath not been ſo ſeriouſly conſidered as it may hereafter, but neither this nor any law can be ſuppoſed to be binding <hi>ex poſt facto,</hi> or contrary to our fundamental conſtitution. <hi>Monteſquieu</hi> obſerves, that the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> conſtitution (which God preſerve) will be loſt, whenever the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative power ſhall be more corrupted than the executive part of the legiſlature.</p>
            <p>And after all, in this very law, the <hi>Americans</hi> are allowed to be repreſented in their own Aſſemblies, and to lay on duties and taxes, though not excluſively; but whether <hi>America,</hi> or any part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, ſhould be liable to have taxes impoſed on them by different legiſlatures, and whether theſe would not frequently claſh with one another to the detriment of crown and ſubjects, I leave others duly to conſider.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, if <hi>America</hi> cannot be taxed by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, then it would be independent of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> This is now a very popular cry, and it is well if many join in it only becauſe they know no better. This is not, will not, cannot be the caſe. <hi>America</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſedly hath not been thus taxed ſince it was ſettled; but no body in <hi>Britain</hi> or <hi>America</hi> ever dreamed that <hi>America</hi> was independent. In <hi>England</hi> the people cannot be taxed when the Parliament does not ſit, or when it is diſſolved; are they then therefore indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>Scotland</hi> cannot be taxed in the ſame degree as <hi>England</hi>; is it therefore independent? <hi>Ireland</hi> and <hi>Jerſey</hi> have their own legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſo tax themſelves; will you call them independent? All thoſe parts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire that have no Aſſemblies pay no taxes at all, neither among themſelves, nor to <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; but it will not therefore be ſaid, that they are independent. The Parliament itſelf claims a right to refuſe ſupplies till their grievances are heard and redreſſed, this is looked upon as a conſtitutional remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any encroachments by the crown, and hath very often been made uſe of in former reigns, and yet the Parliament neither claimed nor were charged with a deſire of independency. Thoſe who ſo freely charge with a deſire of independency, and even treaſon and rebellion, would do well to conſider, that this charge, heinous as it is, reflects greater diſgrace on thoſe who unjuſtly make it, than on thoſe on whom it is unjuſtly made. A man of honour would not eaſily forgive himſelf whenever he ſhould diſcover that he made ſo raſh a charge againſt two millions of people, as innocent, loyal, and well affected to their King and country, as any of his fellow ſubjects or himſelf poſſibly can be. There never was an <hi>American Jacobite,</hi> the very air of <hi>America</hi> is death to ſuch monſters, never any grew there, and if any are tranſported, or import themſelves, loſs of ſpeech always attends them. The loyalty of the <hi>Americans</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:011542_0026_0F8726115451CC28"/>
to their King hath not only been ever untainted, it hath never been as much as ſuſpected. There is a difference between inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency and uneaſineſs. In the late reign, the people in <hi>England</hi> were uneaſy at the <hi>Jew</hi> Bill, and it was rapidly repealed; in the preſent, the Cyder Act was an odious meaſure, and immediately altered, and that without any diſgrace or diminution of parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary authority. If there hath been any appearance of riot in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> perhaps it may hereafter appear at whoſe inſtigation, the law was ever open, and even overbearing odious Cuſtom-Houſe Officers might have been redreſſed, if they had thought fit to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply for a legal rather than a military remedy. In <hi>England</hi> it is poſſible Majeſty itſelf hath met with indignities which have not been ſhewn in <hi>America</hi> even to thoſe men to whom the nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral is indebted for the preſent uneaſineſs, and it is not improbable, that, after all that hath been ſaid and done, the <hi>Americans</hi> will be found an exception to the general rule, that oppreſſion makes even a wiſe man mad: An ancient rule, the truth of which hath been experienced in <hi>England</hi> oftener than in <hi>America.</hi> The opinion of the <hi>Americans</hi> is, that to be taxed where they are not repreſented would deprive them of the rights of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> nay, in time, with the loſs of the conſtitution, might and muſt deprive them of liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and property altogether. Theſe it muſt be owned are gloomy apprehenſions; two millions of people are ſo thoroughly prepoſſeſſed with them, that even their children unborn may feel the parents im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions; ſhould there be any real ground for them, the <hi>Americans</hi> can hardly be blamed; they ſit uneaſy under them; they can no more help their uneaſineſs, than deny the blood which glows in their veins, or be angry with the milk that was their firſt nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This is not a dark abſtruſe point, but ſeems plain and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ttial to the very being of liberty. The ſole queſtion is, Is it, or is it not, the right of an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> not to be taxed where he is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented? Can you be tired of being repreſented, O <hi>Britons!</hi> Is it conſiſtent with the conſtitution you ſo juſtly boaſt of to be thus taxed? Then repreſentation is not eſſential to your conſtitution, and ſooner or later you will either give it up or be deprived of it. A borough that does not exiſt ſhall ſend two repreſentatives, a ſingle county, neither the largeſt nor richeſt, ſhall ſend forty-four members, and two millions of ſouls, and an extent of land of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred miles in length, ſhall have taxes laid on them by ſuch as never were nearer to them than one thouſand leagues, and whoſe intereſt it may be to lay heavy burdens on them in order to lighten their own. And are theſe, who are thus taxed, unrepreſented, unheard and unknown, <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and taxed by <hi>Engliſhmen?</hi> Do theſe enjoy what the charters moſt ſolemnly enſure them, the ſame
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011542_0027_0F87261224250188"/>
and all the privileges of the ſubjects born and reſident within the realm? I muſt doubt it.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe who make light of <hi>American</hi> grievances give a plain anſwer to this plain queſtion, Are the colonies to be taxed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament repreſented in Parliament? if they are, by whom, or ſince when? if not, once more, Is it, or is it not, the right of <hi>Britons</hi> not to be taxed where not repreſented? Here the whole matter hinges, and ſurely the queſtion is not ſo impertinent but a civil anſwer might be given before a mother ſends fire and ſword into her own bowels. When conſtitutional liberty is once loſt, the tranſit is very ſhort to the loſs of property; the ſame power that may deprive of the one may alſo deprive of the other, and with equal juſtice; thoſe that have not liberty enough to keep their property in reality have no property to keep. Some that look no further build right upon power, and inſiſt the Parliament can do ſo. If power is all that is meant very like it may, ſo it may alter the conſtitution. If a ſtately tree ſhould take umbrage at ſome diminutive ſhrubs, it can fall upon and cruſh them, but it cannot fall upon them without tearing up its own roots; it can cruſh thoſe within reach, but its own branches will take off the weight of the impreſſion, permit the ſhrubs to ſend forth new ſhoots, while there is no great probability that the envious oak will return to its former ſtand and vigour. <hi>Ce'ſt une choſe a bien conſiderer,</hi> (this ought to be well conſidered firſt) ſaid <hi>Moliere</hi>'s <hi>Malade imaginaire,</hi> when his quack propoſed to him to have one of his arms cut off, becauſe it took ſome of the nouriſhment which in that caſe would center in the other, and make it ſo much the ſtronger. If every Aſſembly in <hi>America</hi> is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, the conſequence muſt be, that the people are without their uſual legiſlature, and in that caſe nothing ſhort of a miracle ſeems capable to prevent an anarchy and general confuſion. No power can alter the nature of things, that which is wrong cannot be right, and oppreſſion will never be productive of the love and ſmiles of thoſe that feel it.</p>
            <p>The Parliament can cruſh the <hi>Americans,</hi> but it can alſo, and with infinitely greater certainty and eaſe, conciliate their affections, have the ultimate gain of all their labours, and by only continuing them the privileges of <hi>Britons,</hi> that is, by only doing as they would be done by, diffuſe the bleſſings of love and concord throughout the whole empire, and to the lateſt poſterity; and which of theſe two is the moſt eligible, it is NOW for you, O <hi>Britons!</hi> to conſider, and in conſidering it, <hi>majores veſtros cogitate &amp; poſteros,</hi> think on your anceſtors and your poſterity.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thoſe whom God hath joined together,</hi> (Great-Britain <hi>and</hi> America<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Liberty and Loyalty) let no man put aſunder: And may peace and proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity ever attend this happy union.</hi> FEB. 1, 1769.</p>
