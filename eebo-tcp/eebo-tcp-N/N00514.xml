         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Some on the Bench showing their willingness to allow of <hi>W. B's</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions against the two Jurors, Justice <hi>Cook</hi> said, <hi>I will not allow of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is there four of us of a mind?</hi>

               <p>Then <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> read the Act against Printing, 14 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. against Books being printed without the Printers Name to them, and he said, <hi>That was one Act which they prosecuted</hi> W. Bradford <hi>upon.</hi>

Penn</hi>'s &amp; the <hi>Quakers</hi> Books were printed without the Printers Name to them, when that Act was in force; and yet we never heard that any Printer in <hi>England</hi> was prosecuted for that; and therefore these here have exceeded them in <hi>England</hi>; which manifests their Malice and revengeful Spirit, that because they cannot fix the matter to be any Breach of the Peace (tho' they pretend it is) they'll prosecute the Printer for not putting his Name to what they suppose he Printed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> That all the time these Persons were upon Tryal, the grand Jury sate by them, over-awing and threatning them when they spoke boldly in their own defence, and one of the Jury had Pen, Ink &amp; Paper to write down such words as they disliked, signifying that they would present them, and Justice <hi>Cook</hi> other times bid them take notice of such and such words, thereby over-awing the Prisoners that they had not liberty to plead freely. And when <hi>Tho. Harris,</hi> at the Request of the Prisoner began to say something to the matter, they stopt him, and bid an Officer take him away, and <hi>Arthur Cook</hi> said, <hi>That he should plead no more there.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After a long time of pleading, <hi>D. Lloyd</hi> began to summons up the matter to Jury, <hi>How that the printed Appeal was a Seditious Paper, and tended to weaken the Hands of the Magistrates, and encourage all manner of Wickedness; and that it was evident</hi> W.
