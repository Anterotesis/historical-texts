            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following account, is one of the moſt ſhocking. A brief nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the life of one, who, before he was twenty years of age, could delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately murder a family, for the ſake of plundering the houſe, it is apprehended, may be of ſome ſervice to mankind. When they conſider the fearful end of one, brought up in profaneneſs, neglect of public worſhip, without pious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction or learning, profaning GOD's ſabbaths, and blaſpheming his name; which the wretched malefactor repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents as having been very much his caſe. The narrative is penned from the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal's mouth, though not always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in his own words. Some moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections are interſperſed.</p>

            <head>A BRIEF NARRATIVE, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>AS they tell me, I was born at New-Milford, the 25th of October, 1760, and lived with my parents until I was about nine years of age. By this time, I was become quite expert in uſing bad lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, having been accuſtomed to profaneneſs, from the time I was capable of forming articulate ſounds. How early was the infernal dialect become habitual! I was then ſent to live with Mr. Nathan Hawley, where I abode about two years and an half. Here I had but little opportunity of going to ſchool, and that which I had, was not moſt carefully improved; but very little proficiency was made in learning to read. When about eleven years old, as near as I can recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, I ran away from Mr. Hawley's, under pretence of having been abuſed: But there I began to pilfer, by ſtealing green corn, which was, (if I rightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member) the beginning of that infamous practice, which led me on to the moſt horrid crimes ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted. I then went to my father's houſe, and lived there about one year. Then I was ſent to live with one Mr. Ebenezer Boſtwick, where I continued part of one ſummer; but being uneaſy, would live there no longer, and returned to my father, with whom I lived till the following ſpring, when I returned to Mr. Boſtwick's. Preſently, I grew very uneaſy, imagining myſelf treated with too much ſeverity. Here, my temper, naturally paſſionate, frequently vented itſelf in perverſe language, or was manifeſted by a ſullen dumbneſs. Inſomuch, that when a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:016756_0004_0F9DF23DC4C728E8"/>
plough boy, I would frequently either not ſpeak at all, or uſe ſuch language as is not fit to be repeated. Being now about twelve years of age, I could not read; had ſcarce ever been in a place of public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips; nor always, where family worſhip was, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That parents counſel's, warnings, and ſolemn admonitions may come with weight on children's minds, family prayer and public worſhip are of great importance.</p>
            <p>Here I was guilty of pillaging a neighbour's gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, ſtole ſome water-melons, &amp;c. However ſmall theſe crimes may appear to ſome, yet, when viewed in the light of eternity, and as leading to the moſt dreadful enormities, they muſt appear awfully fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>During this year, my time was ſpent in going to one place to live, and then to another, diſquieted, like the troubled ſea, which cannot reſt.</p>
            <p>When I was about thirteen years old, I was ſent to live at another place, and not long after, was let out to Mr. Daniel Tyrrell; from whoſe ſon, I pretty ſoon ſtole ſome money. I was detected, reproved, admoniſhed, and warned of my danger, by ſome who reminded me of the notorious Fra<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ie<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and his fearful end, ſimilar to which they feared mine would be. I was corrected as well as warned, and my father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and I was ſent to him. With him I conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till the ſpring following, when I went to live with Mr. Aaron Hitchcock, where I learned to read, though but poorly. Contrary to orders, I rode away his horſe, which being diſcovered, he threatened to puniſh me. Upon this, I ſtole a ſmall matter of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and a ſilk handkerchief, and run away. Finding
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016756_0005_0F9DF23E71623E10"/>
that I was purſued, I concealed myſelf by the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and thought within myſelf, when the two men in purſuit of me rode by, "I loved to ſee the devils ride. They are got fooled once<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe are his very words, which, he ſays, expreſs his mind, and which he then conceived.</note>." I had once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore run away from the ſame man, with whom, it had been well for me, if I had lived. I was carried back the next day, and corrected. There I was to have lived 'till I was ſixteen; but being diſcontented, I went again to my father's, being now about fourteen.</p>
            <p>The next winter my father bound me to Mr. John Stillwell, to live with him till I was of age. With him I lived more than a year. While I lived here, I once laid a plan to murder Mr. Stillwell, and how to conceal it, in the following manner: When we were in the field, drawing logs, and Mr. Stillwell was ſtooping down to put the chain round the log, I took up the ax to knock him on the head, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to draw the log over him, tear him to pieces, and ſo conceal the murdering of him. But my heart then failed me, not being yet ſo hardened in ſin, as to carry into execution my horrid plan, and perpetrate the ſhocking crime. It is a maxim, as old as antient Rome, That no man becomes a devil in a minute. Things of trifling value I ſtole here, ſuch as eggs, hens, potatoes, &amp;c. and ſold them to perſons near where I then lived, which was at Pitts-Town. The ſummer following, I ſtole Mr. Stillwell's horſe, and ran away. Before I got to Stockbridge, I turned up the horſe; and, about a month after, went home to my father, continuing the wretched practice of pilfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:016756_0006_0F9DF23F4F4F6B18"/>
green corn, water-melons, and the like, leading a moſt careleſs, ſtupid life, neither reading, praying, or attending any public worſhip. Indeed, I had now almoſt forgot that which I once learnt, as to reading.</p>
            <p>The winter following, I enliſted for three years, in Col. Brewers regiment, belonging to the State of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts; went to Ticonderoga, March 1777; tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there till the fort was evacuated by our troops, retreated with our forces; was at the battle of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bartown; then retreated to Sillwater. Here, being one day enraged at a ſoldier, in my paſſion, I threw a club at him, which miſſing him, wounded an officer, and I was puniſhed. When our army, after Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Burgoyne's ſurrender, came down to Albany, I was there viſited with ſore ſickneſs; then went home upon a furlough for 12 days, and, by imprudence, got a very ſevere relapſe.</p>
            <p>Early the next ſpring, I went to Danbury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where I kept guard two months; during which, I ſtole hens, geeſe, Continental rum and wine. From thence I went to Valley-Forge, and joined the army; but on the road ſtole ſome ſugar; was at the battle at Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth; remained with the army till General Patter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's brigade, to which I belonged, came to Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, the October following. There I got a paſs for one day, to go and ſee my brother, and was then to rejoin the army. But never joined that brigade again. I went to my brother's, and then to my father's, and on the road ſtole a pair of ſtockings. Then went and lived at four different places in Cornwall at Canaan, in leſs than four months, diſcontented at each, for ſome reaſon or other. I was then hired by a man in Nobletown, to go into the ſervice for nine
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016756_0007_0F9DF240AF368858"/>
months, and went to Albany and joined Capt. Bovit's company. As the man that hired me, refuſed to pay part of what he promiſed, I attempted to return to my father; but was purſued, overtook, and carried back—joined the regiment, (Col. Ranſſelaers.) From Albany went with a party to the German Flatts, and remained there till about October, 1779. During this campaign, I ſtole one pair of braſs ſhoe-buckles from a ſoldier; a piece of linen cloth from one of the inhabitants; a powder horn, powder, bullet-pouch, and bullets, from a ſoldier. Being one day ſent out upon a ſcout, with ſome others, we plundered an houſe, by leave of the officer; and I privately, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leave, ſet it on fire.</p>
            <p>Having obtained a furlough of twelve days to go home, on the road ſtole a pair of ſilver ſhoe-buckles; between Sheffield and Canaan ſtole an horſe, and rode it almoſt home. On the way I ſtole two ſhirts, one frock, and a piece of linen cloth, at different places. In the beginning of November, went to live in New-York State; ſtole one Continental dollar. Returned, and about the end of that month, went to live at Mr. Caleb Mallery's.</p>
            <p>He took me in out of pity and compaſſion, and engaged to let me have ſome cloathing, of which I ſtood in ſpecial need, and for which I made the moſt vile, ungrateful, and deteſtable returns, as the ſequel of this tragical ſtory will tell.</p>
            <p>Juſt at the cloſe of the month of January, 1780, about five or ſix days before my perpetrating the blackeſt crimes that ever mortals committed, I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined upon the murder of Mr. Mallory and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, the firſt opportunity; and this, merely, for the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016756_0008_0F9DF2418217CC10"/>
ſake of plundering his houſe; without the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, or prejudice againſt any of them. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in which I now lived conſiſted of Mr. Mallery, Mrs. Mallery, a daughter in law, a daughter, and three grand children.</p>
            <p>I was haunted and poſſeſſed with the thoughts of murder, from the time of my firſt entertaining them, both day and night. Nor could I get rid of them, even when I attempted to do it.—Mr. Mallery's own daughter being a tayloreſs, went out to work: her ſiſter in law ſpake of going to pay a viſit, and tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all night: which was the time I fixed upon to execute my bloody, land-defiling, ſoul-ruining, and heaven-daring plan. With great impatience I waited for, and endeavoured to haſten the daughter in law to pay her viſit, while the other daughter was abſent. On the 3d of February, ſhe went away accordingly, and tarried that night—A night big with uncommon horror. My heart trembles and is moved out of its place, at the relation of this moſt tremendous, cruel, bloody, and amazing ſcene.—Mr. Mallery and his wife with one of the children, went to bed in the ſame room—he lying in one bed, and the other two in the other. Upon this, I took a piece of cloth and made me a knapſack: and then went to plundering the daughter in law's room, ſearching for ſome hard mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, which, I underſtood ſhe had, but could not find it. After putting ſome things into my knapſack; with the candle in one had and the ſwingle in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I went into the room where Mr. Mallery, his wife and one grand child lay aſleep. Firſt I ſmote him with my might once or twice on his head; upon this Mrs. Mallery awaking attempted to riſe up; I
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016756_0009_0F9DF24234FCF4E8"/>
turned and ſtruck her one or two blows. Mr. Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery then ſprung up; I ſtruck immediately at him; but he partly warded off the blow with his arm, and then ſtruck the candle out of my hand; I then puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him back, and down upon the bed, belabouring him with the club—He aſked me who I was? what I meant? and ſaid, tell me what you do it for? Then called to his wife to come and help him repeatedly. Who can abſtain from tears, while relating theſe things! Mrs. Mallery made no anſwer, only ſhrieks, cries, and doleful lamentations. Having for ſome time ſmote Mr. Mallery and pounded him, the ſwingle ſplit. Upon this, I catched a gun which ſtood behind the door, and with this inſtrument of death, proceeded ſtill to ſmite him: I then turned again, and did the ſame to Mrs. Mallery, and continued ſtriking till ſhe lay ſtill as well as he.</p>
            <p>The child, in bed with its grand mother, was ſeven years and eight months old. Theſe cruel blows and piercing cries awoke the tender babe, in ſhocking ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize, even while I was killing her grand father; and ſtarting up ſhe aſks, her dear but wounded grand mother, what is the matter. She cried out bitterly; ſhe called out for me, or to me, by the name, the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant child uſed to call me, ſaying, <hi>Mr. Nicholas</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Nicholas was the name by which he was called in that family: and Mr. Nicholas by the child.</note>. But I continued paying on; feeling no remorſe at killing my aged patrons and benefactors. For the child, I ſeemed to feel, ſome ſmall relentings, without remitting in the leaſt, my execrable exertions. This anger was curſed, for it was moſt barbarous and cruel.

Probably this child was at this time mortally wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for ſhe gave a few terrible ſhrieks, which (one would think) were enough to pierce the hardeſt heart, and reach the center of the moſt obdurate ſinner's ſoul: And then ſhe lay ſtill, ſighing and groaning in the moſt affecting manner.</p>
            <p>The room being now beſmeared with blood, and filled with horrendous groans: I went into the other room, lighted the candle, and preſently returned to this room, in which expiring groan anſwered to groan. Nor was Pharaoh's heart harder than mine For a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt theſe dying groans and ſtreaming blood, I looked for the key to open the cheſt where the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney lay; but could not find it. Then I went, got a peſtle and broke open the cheſt. By this time both Mr. Mallery and his wife began to ſtruggle—I maſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his head all to pieces with this inſtrument: And ſhe riſing partly up in the bed, I ſmote her alſo with the peſtle on her head, ſeveral times, and ſhe tumbled behind the bed. Before this I ſaw her face ſwoln to twice its common bigneſs, disfigured with wounds, and covered with gore and ſtreaming blood.</p>
            <p>To an heart not paſt all feeling what could have been more ſhocking! But how unmoved was I, who now ſet myſelf to ſearching for the money of the dead. Having found a conſiderable ſum of paper currency, and ſome ſolid coin; and ſearched among the papers for more, ſcattering them about. I put on ſome of the dying man's clothes:—plundering the room in which thoſe ſtill groaning perſons, in the anguiſh of death, then were lying. Then, I went into a room where the two other grand children lay. Theſe were waked up by the preceding blows or

cries, and aſked for their clothes to get up. I told them to lye down, and go to ſleep for it was not morning. They cried and aſked what was the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with their grand mother? I anſwered, ſhe was ſick. They aſked again, What made her make ſuch a noiſe? And then they lay down, ſobbing<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe two children were, one about ſix, the other a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four years old.</note>. I then plundered the houſe of ſundry articles. After this, I ſet a fire in the milk room, another in the outward room, and another up chamber, in the flax and tow. Seeing the houſe well on fire, and the outward room all filled with blaze, I ſet off for Blue Swamp, about eight miles from thence. But for want of a track in the ſnow, was obliged to go about twelve miles to get there. From thence I purpoſed for Ball Town. Arrived at Blue Swamp, about nine o'clock, A. M. But no ſooner had I finiſhed the dreadful ſcene of murder, than fear attacked me—Fleeing from the burning houſe and croſſing a bridge near by, I was afraid it would break under me, and kill me.—After I got to Blue Swamp (ſtrange to relate) I tarried there from Friday morning till the next Wedneſday afternoon: Sometimes I felt alarmed and determined immediately to flee with all poſſible ſpeed: And in a few moments would ſink into a ſtate of the utmoſt careleſſneſs and remiſſneſs. Notwithſtanding repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed reſolutions, one thing and another would inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, and I could not go. The next day after I got to Blue Swamp, we heard of the conflagration. I concluded, they would think that I was burnt up, and was left to that ſtupidity, great part of the time,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016756_0012_0F9DF246578817F8"/>
as not to imagine they would hear of me. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, I apprehended, I ſhould be immediately taken, then ſunk into the greateſt ſecurity. On Wedneſday afternoon, I ſet off and went to Cornwall, where I put up for that night; when I was purſued and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in bed. Upon this I confeſſed the murder; though I falſified the truth as to my having an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice. For I ſolemnly declare, that no perſon living knew any thing about my murderous deſign, or had the leaſt hand in it, either mediately or immediately, but myſelf—I undertook and perpetrated it alone, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing, and unheard of as it is.</p>
            <p>After being ſent to gaol, and even before I was committed, I confeſſed the falſehood, reſpecting my ſaying, that I had an accomplice. On the 25th of April, I was arraigned before the honorable ſuperior court of this State, and plead guilty to the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of murder, laid in againſt me.</p>
            <p>On the 27th, ſentence of death was publicly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; and, upon the eighth of May next, I am to be executed. O that others may take warning by my dreadful example and fearful end! And avoid thoſe ſins which I have committed, and which by a ſeries of wickedneſs have led me on to the moſt aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful crimes that ever were perpetrated in this land, or perhaps any other; and for which I muſt (moſt juſtly) ſuffer a violent death, and I greatly fear, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burning, horror and deſpair.</p>

                  <hi>N. B.</hi> A number of thefts, which he mentioned, after the minutes of the above were taken, are not inſerted; and probably many, which he either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got or neglected to tell. He is young in years, but old in crimes, having performed that exploit of wickedneſs, which none other in this land, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps any other, eſpecially in ſo early life, ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted. May the ſordid life, the unheard of crimes, and fearful end, of this poor, wretched male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor, be a warning to parents and children. That parents may be more careful to inſtruct and teach their children; pray with and for them: ſo that they abſtain from profaneneſs, and other works of darkneſs, attend public worſhip, being taught by precept and example. And that children would early call on God, avoid ſin and all temptation, as knowing that ſins which, to them may perhaps ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſmall, yet being indulged, open the flood-gates to all manner of impiety, and lead down to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of everlaſting death</p>
               <p>As he is alſo to be conſidered in the character of a deſorter from the army, having been repeatedly guilty of that dreadful ſin, may others take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and not dare to do ſo wickedly, leſt they incur the vengeance of Heaven, and of their injured Country.</p>
