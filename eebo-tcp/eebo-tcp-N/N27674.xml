            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N the ſolemnity of the hour, you, my FELLOW TOWNS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MEN, call upon me to paint the character and to portray the virtues of the favorite SON OF COLUMBIA. Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to riſe to the height of his excellence, I muſt ſubmit his merits to your knowledge of his actions; and lodge his worth in the grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affections of your hearts.</p>
            <p>ON this day, ſixtyeight years complete their revolutions, ſince our WASHINGTON was given to his country. The Parent of Being endowed him with ſuperior powers of mind and body. Theſe by the progreſs of time were expanded to the moſt commanding features of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036888_0004_100B2A0FC8E61380"/>
man. His clear and comprehenſive under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding was improved by a general acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with ſcience, an extenſive knowledge of hiſtory, and an intimate view of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Poſſeſſing theſe grand principles of knowledge, he early diſcovered a happy genius to apply them to practice. His opinions were always formed upon an high ſcene of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His capacity can be meaſured only by the ſphere in which he moved. Elevated of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices he filled with dignity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and difficult un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings he accompliſhed with renown.</p>
            <p>HIS youthful eſſay of enterpriſe and patrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm diſplayed the bold lines of his character, and gave a ſure pledge of his meridian ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor. Commiſſioned to carry, to an encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enemy, on a diſtant frontier, the juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances of his government; he ſuſtained the fatigues and dangers of the embaſſy with the conſtancy of the veteran ſoldier; with Vauban's penetration he traced the ſite of the fortreſs which was to be the future protection of the country; he conciliated the irritated minds of the Indian Tribes; and, on his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, bore honorable teſtimony of the addreſs and fidelity with which he executed his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036888_0005_100B2A1410B42368"/>
The province of his nativity appreciat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the merit of his ſervice, and appointed him to command the troops embodied to enforce his remonſtrance. His maiden ſword was not unſheathed in vain: In his firſt campaign the laurel was entwined, that ſince has flouriſhed around his temple with perennial, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing verdure.</p>
            <p>ON the next ſummer, General BRAD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOCK commanded a well appointed army to repel the French from their encroachments, and we find WASHINGTON an extra Aidde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp in his family. His knowledge of the country, his acquaintance with the Indian mode of warfare, enabled him to give advice, which might have inſured ſucceſs to the expedition: But the European General, in the pride of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional ſkill, ſpurned the advice of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Youth; and for his temerity, he loſt his life, and his defeated army was indebted to the prudence and bravery of our Young Hero for their preſervation from ruin.</p>
            <p>IN the ſubſequent campaigns, the fatigues of the field became oppreſſive to a conſtitution not yet grown into the firmneſs of manhood. Pulmonary ſymptoms warned him to retire to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036888_0006_100B2A15968722B8"/>
the care of his friends. This interval was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to form and ſtrengthen the ſocial ties, to cultivate and exerciſe the ſocial affections, and to follow the leading bias of his mind in the purſuits of philoſophy and practical agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH warmly attached to domeſtic life, and ſupremely happy in his family, he was not permitted to enjoy the pleaſures of philoſophic retirement. Heaven devoted him to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and the public demanded his care and labor.</p>
            <p>FROM the cloſe of the French war, to the commencement of public reſiſtance to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of the Britiſh Parliament, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial concerns of his country, and the milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and legiſlative tranſactions of his province, engroſſed his time. When the affairs of our country approached their criſis, and the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of our nation was collected to decide her deſtiny, among an aſſembly as auguſt and venerable as America ever ſaw, was our Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot. When the appeal was made to the ſword, by the unanimous will of this body, he was placed at the head of our armies. With a "band of undiſciplined huſbandmen," he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained the operations of a veteran army;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036888_0007_100B2A182C110568"/>
with nine rounds of powder to a man, he, for ſix months, confined them to their quarters;<note n="*" place="bottom">See Gen. WASHINGTON'S Letter to the Preſident of Congreſs.</note> and, when his ſtock of ammunition warranted the attempt, he drove them from the fortified capital of this Common wealth.</p>
            <p>YE Veterans, who followed his ſtandard and fought under his banner, ye beſt can recount the arduous conflicts of the ſubſequent years of his military command. Ye can inform us of the fortitude he exhibited when every heart was deſpondent—the abilities he diſplayed as a commander—the appearances he aſſumed to deceive the enemy at the hazard of his own reputation—the conſtancy with which he perſiſted in his own ſyſtem of war, though urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſperate enterpriſes by the ardent and ſanguine. Ye ſaw his undaunted ſpirit, his boundleſs reſources in the day of defeat; and beheld his moderation and humanity in the hour of victory. Ye can witneſs, that in him ambition was ever an incitement to the nobleſt actions.</p>
            <p>HIS military triumphs complete—Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican Independence acknowledged, and his country viſited with the beams of peace, he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036888_0008_100B2A1A670A9160"/>
carried into the ſhade of retirement, the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and confidence of his army, the gratitude of his country, and the applauſe of the world.</p>
            <p>WE thought he had then attained the zenith of human glory. The prayer of his warmeſt friend, on this point, was ſummed in the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, may no unpropitious event take place to fully the luſtre of his atchievements; in quietneſs may he deſcend to the grave, the lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel unwithered on his brow.</p>
            <p>NOT ſo the will of heaven. The decree had been regiſtered in the divine archives, that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica was free and independent: The Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican Joſhua had led his people into the prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed land: But the band was wanting which might unite the parts of the nation: Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public was deſtitute of the neceſſary principle, to give energy to her powers and force to her will. Among the Sages who aroſe to fix the centre of attraction to our political bodies, and to mark the zone, in which the ſun of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional life and power ſhould revolve, was our Patriot, firſt among equals. Their ſyſtem we adopted, as the ark of our political ſafety, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the deluge of popular factions, whoſe torrents had ſwept every preceding Republic
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036888_0009_100B2A1CCB38DD20"/>
from the face of the earth. Through United America there was but one voice reſpecting the man who ſhould preſide in its adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>THE experiment of a Republican form of government was then to be deciſively made; and the world in ſolemn ſilence attended the iſſue. On the dawn of an adminiſtration, in which new paths were to be explored, firſt principles adopted, and precedents eſtabliſhed, the friends of our Stateſman were tremblingly alive. But this new ſphere of public action diſplayed talents, which before had not fully been called into exerciſe. With the eye of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition, he ſurveyed the relations of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and with his own integrity and firmneſs purſued her intereſts. Under his auſpices, the ſalutary maxim was confirmed, that a ſacred regard to moral obligations, the obſervance of public faith, the undeviating adherence to the plain rules of truth and rectitude, are more certain pledges of national attachment, and ſurer principles of ſucceſs, than the ſubtileſt intrigues and artifices of the Machiavilian Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itician. Moments indeed there were, when we heard the hoarſe clamors of diſappointed ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſaw the dark movements of the ſons
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:036888_0010_100B2A1E89D62488"/>
of faction and anarchy: But experience teſted the wiſdom of his meaſures; and the tide of public reſpect and gratitude ſet with encreaſing fulneſs and force. The fame of the Preſident of the United States is equalled only by the glory of the General of the American Armies. In every future period of our national exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the inſtruction to the Military Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, and the charge to the Political Guide, will be compriſed in one ſentence, GO, IM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ITATE OUR <hi>WASHINGTON.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WITH an equal mind our venerable coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman deſcended from his elevation. He was not corrupted by the power and influence of office. He conſented to become the head of his nation from a ſenſe of the duty he owed his country: Every public obligation fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he gladly reſorted to his beloved retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. This act was pronounced by a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Engliſh Philoſopher, as the conſumma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of character; as the laſt evidence of the greatneſs of the man.</p>
            <p>HE was not long permitted, by his preſence to irradiate the circle of private life; by the ſmiles of his countenance to cheer the hearts of his friends and dependants. <hi>His</hi> ſun was
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:036888_0011_100B2A21E0F8FE88"/>
not to ſet in private, whoſe light roſe with public ſplendor, and ſhone with encreaſing luſtre to the perfect day. The majeſty of our nation was inſulted—her rights of ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were invaded, and ſhe ſummmoned her venerable chief to her aid. His mind, as true to the principle of patriotiſm as the needle to the pole, obeyed the ſummons. He unſheath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſword, and in the poſt of danger ſtood collected to repel the aggreſſions, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the injuries o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> an enemy, intoxicated with ambition, and inſolent from ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>OUR illuſtrious Citizen was as much diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for the reverence of his GOD as for the love of his country. Religion had a lively in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on all the tranſactions of his life. In him we beheld piety without the gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuperſtition; and devotion without the extravagance of enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>DO you inquire into his private character? Follow him to his domeſtic walks; the ſcene of the quiet but refined virtues of man: With him enter the circle of his friends: Behold him in the boſom of his family: There you will ſee all the tender ſenſibilities of the human character; and witneſs the exerciſe of all the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:036888_0012_100B2A247B000100"/>
offices of humanity and benevolence. The more beloved, the more known; as free from private as public blemiſh. So diffident of himſelf, as to be induced to engage in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous duties of the field and cabinet, only from reliance on divine wiſdom to aid good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and divine ſtrength to ſucceed laudable exertions. So diſintereſted, as to refuſe every pecuniary reward for a life of public labor. So unconſcious of his own merits, as in aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment to look around for the origin of that fame, which every breath of air wafted to his ear.</p>
            <p>SUCH was the man, whoſe death we deplore: As fortunate as great: As happy as good.</p>
            <p>IN this period of expectation, when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of the old world ſhake the ſtableſt fabrics of antiquity; and threaten to lay proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the pillars of ſocial order and national fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity, we fondly hoped the life of our beloved Citizen might have been protracted. In his influence we confided to check the progreſs of dangerous opinions; and to counteract the contagion of pernicious principles. Under him, we repoſed as the public ſhield, ſhould our country be invaded, and our armies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered in the field of battle. But he is

gone, never more to engage in works of patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otiſm and humanity. Neither accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of greatneſs, nor purſuits of dignity; public honors, nor national affection; exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive wealth, nor domeſtic felicity, were a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for his exiſtence. That criſis is paſſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, which Solon thought neceſſary to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce a man happy. He died as he had liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His mind was fortified for the event, not by the cold maxims of philoſophy, but by the enlivening hopes of religion. The unaſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſciple of the Prince of Life, to him the valley of death was illuminated by the beams of revelation: The proſpect of exchanging the glory of this world, for an unfading, an immortal wreath, ſupported him through the laſt ſcene of humanity.</p>
            <p>COMPARE this exit with the impious boaſt of the great Frederic of Pruſſia: "Glory is my Deity. Glory is the only reward of great actions which I expect. I dare challenge the reſentment of Heaven; for by a voluntary death I can elude the power of GOD; and in vain will the Almighty hurl his thunderbolt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my tomb."<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſentiment is contained in a treatiſe of the King of Pruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia on the ſubject of Glory, publiſhed at Berlin, and addreſſed to Marſhal Keith.</note>

IN the public legacy of the Father of our country, we have the means to ſupport and perpetuate the fair fabric of national inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence and happineſs, which his hand erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His private Will teſtifies that the love of liberty in him was a living principle. He has undone the heavy burden and let the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed go free. As far as his power extended, he has given freedom to thoſe unhappy beings, whom avarice firſt enſlaved, and who are now holden in bondage by the plea of neceſſity.</p>
            <p>DOES the page of hiſtory contain a name more illuſtrious than his? Did man ever cloſe life with a reputation more immaculate? To compare him with thoſe, whoſe progreſs of ambition was marked with blood, and whoſe greatneſs was erected upon the agonies of the human heart, is to profane his virtues.</p>
            <p>IN other countries, individuals have been il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious as Heroes and Stateſmen. The tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents which immortalized their reſpective names were united in our American Alfred; and he was free from the vices and weakneſſes, which were the ſhades of their characters. In him were combined the moſt excellent qualities of man; and in his life appeared an aſſemblage

of the nobleſt virtues of humanity. "His life was one ſtream of light," and the ſhadow of night reſts not upon it. The picture of man in him was perfect, and there is no blot to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh its brightneſs.</p>
            <p>HIS character we muſt all contemplate with ſupreme delight: In it we view the dignity of our nature; and the glory of our race. As an American character, we may all exult in it, as the ornament of our nation and the honor of our age. As the Patriot, whoſe exalted tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and preeminent endowments were devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our country, we feel the obligations of public gratitude—we are melted to emotions of tenderneſs—we are diſpoſed to expreſs every mark of admiration and reſpect.</p>
            <p>LET the ſculptured marble preſerve his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance, and the ſuperb monument proclaim his achievements; theſe are but the decent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of the public mind. But the ſculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured marble and the coſtly monument are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like unneceſſary to perpetuate his worth. His memory is embalmed in the affections of his grateful countrymen: His name is written in the book of immortal fame: He ſhall be had in everlaſting remembrance.</p>

            <p>CLOTHE thyſelf with mourning, O America! thy brighteſt ornament is faded: Dead is thy exalted, thy moſt beloved Son: Bow your heads, ye Warriors, in ſorrow! ſilent is that voice which waked the thunder of the battle; cold is the heart which animated you to victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and glory. Weep, ye fair Daughters of Columbia! weep in ſympathy with her, from whom is removed the greateſt and the beſt of men; whoſe reſidue of life muſt be dark and ſolitary.—Weep for yourſelves, your Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or is no more!

Through luſt of triumph, he never made the wife a widow, or the child an orphan: He never conſumed the widow's morſel, or the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan's bread. His conqueſts were thoſe of humanity: His power was ever exerciſed in defence of innocence and virtue. Bedew then his urn with the tear of gratitude! Teach your children to liſp his praiſe: Inſtil into their minds his ſpirit; and cheriſh in them the growth of his virtues.</p>
            <p>DWELL, ye Youth, on his merits, till you riſe to admiration of his character! Enkindle in your hearts the love of country: Fan in your Souls the fire of Patriotiſm: Like him reverence your Maker: Regard moral obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: Covet his endowments: Emulate his purity, his integrity and diſintereſtedneſs.

WISDOM, PATRIOTISM and VIRTUE, are the natural growth of our country. Purſue, my Fellow Citizens, the ſyſtem which has eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed our nation. Tranſmit inviolate to poſterity, our fair national inheritance.

            <p>WHILE on this day, we join in condolence with United America, let the feelings of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing be blended with thoſe of gratitude to GOD, who made our countryman the greateſt public bleſſing.
