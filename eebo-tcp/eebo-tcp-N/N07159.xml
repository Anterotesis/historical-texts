            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The three chief of them, Viz. The Prophet, the Father of the Family, and MICHAEL BOINEAU, confidently perſiſted in their Deluſion to their laſt Breath.—They appeared on their Trials, all together eaſy and unconcerned.

They very readily owned, repeated and confirmed, all the Facts and Circumſtances as before-mentioned with no material Variation from what they had done in Court. But when I came to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with them on thoſe Facts, and endeavour to convince them of the Errors and Wickedneſs they were guilty of in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them, they treated me with great Diſdain—Their Motto was, <hi>Anſwer him not a Word!</hi> They were confident they had the Spirit of God Speaking inwardly to their Souls, and who was I to pretend to talk to, or inſtruct them? They had obeyed the Voice of God, and were about to ſuffer Martyrdom for it. But God had aſſured them, that he would either Work a great Deliverance for them, or raiſe them up from the Dead on the third Day. And thus the three before-mentioned, who were Executed continued to inſiſt to their Dying Breath. Their laſt Words to the Spectators were, <hi>that they ſhould ſurely ſee them alive again from the Dead the third Day.</hi>—As to the other three, the Daughter JUDITH was not tried.

He was Tried for this Murder, found Guilty, Condemned and Executed. I attended him again, under this Second Sentence of Death, and it pleaſed God with all apparent Hopes of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. No one ever appeared more ſenſible of his Deluſion, or to die a more hearty and ſincere Penitent, or in greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Hopes of Salvation through the alſufficient Merits of CHRIST his Redeemer.</p>

                  <p>AS my Station is Life and Connexions with ſome of you called me to make a pretty full Enquiry, into your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about Religion; I have taken a good Deal of Pains in my Searches on this Point. I have converſed largely, Time after Time, with ſundry of you on your peculiar Principles; and have read, and maturely conſidered, ſundry Books which have been written to defend them. I have gotten all the Information about you, I could, from ſober, judicious Men, who were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon to be well acquainted with your Principles and Practices in other Parts of the Colony, and in the neighbouring Provinces. Thus, I have carefully endeavoured to guard againſt haſty preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and Party Spirit; ſo that I have ſufficient Reaſons to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that my preſent Opinion of you is well founded.</p>
                  <p>From this full and candid Examination of your religious Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Practices proceeding from them, I am well aſſured you are greatly miſtaken. It appears evident to me, that your No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>immediate Impulſes</hi> and <hi>Revelations</hi> are extremely dangerous; and that your Method of applying and (as you call it) <hi>ſpirituali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing</hi> the Holy Scriptures, expoſes you, and thoſe who give Heed to you, to ſuch Temptations, as Satan has made Uſe of to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade Perſons to commit the moſt horrid Crimes. Methinks ſuch awful Inſtances of following ſtrong Impulſes may warn the World, and convince Men of the pernicious Tendency of <hi>real</hi> Fanaticiſm.</p>
                  <p>Permit me then, while theſe ſhocking Monuments of Satan's Deluſion are before your Eyes, to make one Attempt, in Love and Compaſſion, to ſhew you your unhappy Miſtakes; and to prevent ſober well-meaning Perſons from being deceived by the Impulſes, Revelations, &amp;c. to which thoſe who are properly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Enthuſiaſts pretend.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed true, that there have been ſuch Inſtances of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Deluſion among you, as have convinced many who once
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009120_0012_1030F8C4B6EA9800"/>
joined with you; and might have convinced you all long ago; had you not been ſtrangely inattentive, or unreaſonably byaſſed in Favour of your Errors. Since you ſtill follow your Impulſes, tho' they have led ſome of you into great Extravagancies, and brought you into deſerved Contempt, in various Places; I am afraid there are ſundry who will not be reclaimed by any Thing that can be ſaid. However I hope there are ſome ſerious well diſpoſed Perſons who have been captivated by the ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of your Ringleaders, without having duly conſidered Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Such may follow the Truth when it is diſcovered. Good Jehoſhaphat was found in Alliance with deluded Jehoram. Tho' the Prophet Eliſha would hardly have attempted the Relief of Jehoram, yet he regarded the Preſence of Jehoſhaphat.</p>
                  <p>Hence, I don't write ſo much for the Sake of your Ringlead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who are obſtinately determined to maintain the Opinions they have embraced at all Adventures, right or wrong; and their confirmed Diſciples, as for the ſake of ſome honeſt well meaning Perſons, that have been unwarily captivated by their ſpecious Pretences and extraordinary Zeal; and to inform others, who are ſtill at a Loſs about them, that they may be prevented from embracing their dangerous Errors. And ſince the Hearts of all Men are in the Hands of God, who can tell but he may bleſs a well meant Endeavour to reclaim even ſome who have been long deluded.</p>
                  <p>As I don't write for the learned, I ſhall uſe the greateſt plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Speech, adapting my Style, if poſſible, to the meaneſt Capacities. And leſt you ſhould not take the Force of my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments at firſt View, I ſhall ſubmit to the Drudgery of being a little repetitious, repreſenting ſome of them once and again.</p>
                  <p>You profeſs to be honeſt Enquirers after Truth, and to be conſcientious in your Way. I would fain hope you are ſincere in theſe your Profeſſions; for I always think of you in the moſt favourable Point of Light, your Conduct will poſſibly bear. If you are honeſt and ſincere as you profeſs, I my depend upon it, that you will peruſe this Addreſs with Patience and Candour. I can moſt ſincerely aſſure one and all of you, I mean you no Harm. I really ſeek your beſt Good. Surely the leaſt you can do, if you are honeſt Men, is to read and ſeriouſly weigh theſe Conſiderations which are preſented to you, not with any Hopes of obtaining any worldly Advantage from you, but with a Deſire to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:009120_0012_1030F8C4B6EA9800"/>
promote the true Peace and Proſperity of the Church of Chriſt in general, and the beſt Intereſt of your immortal Souls in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular: The Lord grant it may anſwer theſe important Ends.</p>
                  <p>If there ſhould be any ſo weak as to be provoked by this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, I can aſſure them it has been and now is, my conſtant De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to give juſt Occaſion of Offence to no Perſon in the World. Remember it is written, <note n="a" place="bottom">James i, 19, 20.</note> 
                     <q>Let every Man be ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak, ſlow to Wrath. For the Wrath of Man work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not the Righteouſneſs of God.</q> The beſt of Men may be miſtaken in ſome Things, ſince none are infalliable. Is it notthen a Part of true Chriſt. Charity to ſhew Men their Miſtakes? Why ſhould any become Enemies to me, becauſe I tell them the Truth?—It is honorable for Men to yield to the Force of Truth, and forſake their Errors. But it is ſhocking Pride and a Baſeneſs peculiar to wicked &amp; weak Minds to reſiſt the Truth; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, they are more confirmed in their Miſtakes by the Arguments that are uſed to convince them. Such Perſons often vent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in angry Reproaches and railing, being deſtitute of better Reaſons. If any can be ſo ſilly as to think ſuch Treatment can be any Advantage to them, or their Cauſe, they are quite wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come for any Thing that concerns me.</p>
                  <p>All who have any ſerious Regard for Religion will readily acknowledge, that Miſtakes about it may have the worſt Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. And a moderate Share of Acquaintance with the Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Chriſtian World would diſcover, that there are no Miſtakes about Religion which are of a more pernicious Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, or have produced more ſhocking Conſequences, than thoſe which ariſe from Enthuſiaſm. Have not the high Pretences of Enthuſiaſts, to immediate Impulſes and Revelations, prejudiced many againſt the convincing, converting and ſanctifying Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of the Spirit? Have not ſuch Notions been an Occaſion of leading ſome half-thinking Perſons to believe there is nothing in experimental Religion, but the extravagant Fancies and wild Imaginations of crazy Brains and ignorant Fanaticks.</p>
                  <p>The Enthuſiaſm which ſo greatly prevailed in Cromwell's Time, the Lay-Exhorters and Soldier-Preachers, prepared the Way for that Flood of Arminianiſm and Irreligion, which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed the Nation in the ſucceeding Reigns. Yea this has af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded the Deiſts one of their moſt ſpecious Topicks to burleſque

                  <p>Is it not evident that where Separations have moſt generally prevailed in New-England; looſe Principles and vicious Practices have ſucceeded in their Turn, and increaſed in Proportion as the Separations had done, eſpecially among the riſing Generation? And is not one great Cauſe of this, that ſuch Perſons educate their Children in a Diſregard and Contempt of regular Preaching and Ordinances? For when they grow up to Years of Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their own Reaſon teaches them that the groſs Miſtakes of their Parents cannot be right. Yet they cannot eaſily ſhake off the Prejudices their Parents early inſtilled into their Minds againſt the ſtanding Miniſtry. Hence, they loſe all Benefit of publick Preaching, grow careleſs about Religion and too often openly vicious. However little Regard you pay to me, or to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches; you had better conſider your Conduct for your own Sakes, and the Sakes of your Children, who are likely to be great Sufferers in their ſpiritual Intereſts, by their cloſe Connexions with you.</p>
                  <p>You did not indeed, I charitably believe, foreſee that ſuch awful Conſequences would ariſe from your Notions, and Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; and I hope, you don't continue in them with a Deſign to deſtroy experimental Religion and introduce Vice and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneſs in the Land.

Some of thoſe unaccountably overlook theſe Things in which Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion chiefly conſiſts, in their great Zeal for ſome high Peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arities of <hi>their own.</hi> Who can tell how far a righteous God may permit Satan to miſlead them, for their Puniſhment in aiming at, and ſeeking after immediate Impulſes and Revelations; while they are not duly thankful for the written Word of God, and the ſanctifying Influences of the Spirit?

The Apoſtle Paul found it neceſſary to inform them, that how much ſoever they might value themſelves, on Account of their extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts, Divine Charity in the Soul was infinitely more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant. How much more pernicious and dangerous muſt it be for Perſons to pride themſelves, in their immediate Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when their Pretenſions have no juſt Foundation?</p>
                  <p>From this brief View of Things, it appears, it will be a Piece of good Service done to Religion to expoſe Enthuſiaſm, that ſo its Spread and Growth may be in ſome Meaſure prevented.

                  <p>Here, that I may proceed with all poſſible Clearneſs, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to obſerve, that ſome of theſe Impulſes and Revelations are without Scripture <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>As to the Teachings and Influences of the Holy Spirit. God reaches us by his Spirit by giving us a ſufficient— and a finiſhed or compleated Rule of Faith and Practice in all Things neceſſary to Salvation in his Written Word—and by bringing his People ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to know, and love, and be duly influenced by the Holy Scriptures.</p>

                     <p>Now if the Saints of old had any Notices of Salvation by Chriſt, they muſt have had ſome Ideas of a future State of Rewards and Puniſhments. For it is principally eternal Puniſhment which Chriſt delivers his People from, and eternal Salvation which he purchaſes for them by his Obedience, Sufferings and Death. When God had given ſuch terrible Diſplays of his Anger in this Life againſt Sin, as the Puniſhment of our firſt Parents, and the drowning of the old World, what could the Iſralites reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly think become of thoſe who died without being ſavingly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the glorious Redeemer?

                     <p>The Hopes of a glorious Immortality were a Support to the People of God in their Afflictions under the Moſaic Diſpenſation.

                        <note n="q" place="bottom">Eccleſ. viii. 11.</note> And it is certain that the wicked were ſo often proſperous, and the righteous afflicted during that Diſpenſation, that ſome of the moſt eminent Saints were greatly ſtumbled at it.

                     </p>
                     <p>The ſame Covenant of Grace was adminiſtered under the Old Teſtament as under the New, tho' in a different Manner. The ſame Salvation was preached, the ſame Saviour was repreſented and typified, tho' with different Rites, and in a more obſcure Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Temporal Bleſſings and Puniſhments were but Appendages to the Abrahamic Covenant.</p>
                     <p>God carried on the Scheme of eternal Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt then, as well as now, and recommended it by the ſame Heaven and Hell. And tho' this Salvation was not ſo clearly repreſented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Chriſt actually came in the Fleſh, yet the People of God had ſuch Intimations of the glorious Redeemer as were ſufficient for their Truſt in him. All Things that were then neceſſary for Salvation were ſo plainly revealed in the Old Teſtament, that our Bleſſed Lord himſelf teaches, that thoſe who refuſed to hear and obey Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the Prophets, would not have repented, tho' one had been ſent from the dead to preach to them. "Search the Scriptures," was Chriſt's Direction. "It is written in the Scriptures," was a deciſive Proof with the Apoſtles. The Scriptures are ſaid by the Apoſtle Paul, <q>to be able to make Men wiſe unto Salvation, thro' Faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two Things plainly follow from what has been now proved.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. That it is not an abſurd Thing to baptiſt the Infants of Chriſtian Parents under the Goſpel. Circumciſion the Rite of Admiſſion into the viſible Church is changed into Baptiſm. But ſince the Covenant is the ſame, Infants may be viſibly taken into it, under the Goſpel, as well as they were under the Law.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The written Word of God contains all Inſtructions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to our Salvation. If the Scriptures of the Old Teſtament were ſufficient for the Jews, it would be very abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the written Word of God which we now have, when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles are added to thoſe of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and the Prophets; and when Life and Immortality are more
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:009120_0017_1030F8D431F231A0"/>
clearly bro't to Light by the Goſpel, and the Reſurrection of Chriſt, does not contain all Things neceſſary for Salvation.</p>
                     <p>The Evangeliſts profeſs to write THE GOSPEL of Chriſt, and who, that firmly believes they were divinely inſpired, can doubt whether they have done it ſufficiently? Was not the immediate Inſpiration of the Spirit granted unto them, to lead them to a perfect Remembrance of the Goſpel Hiſtory themſelves, that they ſhould not commit any Miſtake in their Inſtructions; and to enable them to communicate, and write them to others with ſufficient plainneſs? Who dare ſay, that the inſpired Diſciples of Chriſt have not faithfully recorded, whatſoever he commanded them in the New Teſtament?</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle John plainly appears to to have wrote his Goſpel as a Supplement to the other three. <note n="ſ" place="bottom">See Doddridge, on the Time of writing the Hiſtorical Books.</note> We are informed by the Fathers, who lived in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, and whoſe Teſtimony is of great Weight in this Caſe, that he wrote it in extream Old Age, very near the Concluſion of the firſt Century. He was undoubtedly the laſt of the inſpired Writers. He bears the following Teſtimony to the ſufficiency of the written Word. <note n="t" place="bottom">John xx. 30, 31.</note> 
                        <q>Many other Signs truly did Jeſus in the Preſence of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, which are not written in this Book; but theſe are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten that ye might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ye might have Life thro' his Name.</q> Thus according to the Apoſtle John's Account, which he wrote by the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate inſpiration of the Holy Spirit, all Things neceſſary to Faith and eternal Life, are to be found in the written Word.</p>
                     <p>Now if the Scriptures be a ſufficient Rule, if they contain a Revelation which teaches us all Things neceſſary to Salvation, to Faith and Practice, and that in a Manner ſufficiently plain; there can be no Need of the Traditions of Papiſts, the infalibility of the Pope; nor of the immediate Revelations of Enthuſiaſts, to direct us in our Conduct.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But I muſt now proceed another Step, namely, that <hi>the Scriptures are ſuch a perfect Rule, that we are to expect no further Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations and Directions relating to Religion.</hi> God has given us the <hi>whole</hi> Revelation of his Will, which he deſigns for our religious Inſtruction, in the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p>The Writers of the New Teſtament evidently prove this by
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:009120_0017_1030F8D431F231A0"/>
their frequent Appeals to the Old Teſtament, and their own Writings, as the only Standard or Teſt of Truth and Error <q>If any Man, <hi>ſays the Apoſtle Paul,</hi> think himſelf to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet or ſpiritual, let him acknowledge that the Things which I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord</q>

                     <p>It has been ſuppoſed, that this is one Thing which is intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in thoſe remarkable Words of Chriſt, which are at the Cloſe of the laſt Book of the Bible, <q>I teſtify unto every Man that heareth the Words of the Prophecy of this Book, if any Man ſhall add unto theſe Things, God ſhall add unto him the Plagues that are written in this Book.

                     <p>Anſ. God does not ſay in this Text, that he would put his Words in their Mouths in an immediate Way. You have no Right to add to his Words. Why may not God refer in this Promiſe to his putting his Words in Men's Mouths by Means of the

Scriptures, which were written by the Inſpiration of the Spirit, and which are by Way of Eminency the Word of God? Does not the Spirit of God alſo put his Words in the Hearts and Mouths of Sinners by his convincing and ſanctifying Influences, ſetting divine Truth home on their Conſciences? Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what is promiſed here may be fully performed in theſe other ordinary Ways, without immediate Revelation; I don't ſee how this Text can be any Thing to your Purpoſe. Your Concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from this Text, that it muſt be immediate, is juſt like his Reaſoning in the Play; who, as ſoon as he heard that Pamphilus was not to have Glycerium for his Wife, inferred he muſt have her himſelf, as if there had been no other Men in the World.</p>
                     <p n="2">2 Ob. But has not Chriſt promiſed in the New Teſtament, <note n="y" place="bottom">John xvi. 26.</note> to his Diſciples, that <q>the Comforter or Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach them all Things; and bring all Things to their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance!</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Anſ. Chriſt had chiefly a Referrence to his Apoſtles in this Paſſage. He was ſpeaking to them —As he ſent them to preach the Goſpel to all Nations, to an ignorant and malicious World; and appointed them to write the New Teſtament for the Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind, and the Edification of his Church in all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Ages; ſo the immediate Teachings and Inſpirations of the Spirit, were abſolutely neceſſary for them.</p>
                     <p>So far as this Text refers to Chriſtians in general, it may be very reaſonably interpreted of the Spirit's improving the written Word, in his convincing, inlightening and ſanctifying Influences. But if any will pretend that the Spirit teaches them all Things, and brings all Things to their Remembrance, now, in an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Way; I would remind ſuch, that we are informed by St. John, that there were many other Things which Jeſus did, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe that were written. Pray reveal ſome of thoſe Things, which are not written in the Bible to the World. Daniel and his Companions actually revealed Nebuchadnezzar's Dream to him.</p>
                     <p>When God gives immediate Revelations and Directions to Men, he gives ſome Evidence, which is ſufficient, if duly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to and examined, to prove that ſuch Revelations come from him as their true Original. This is abſolutely neceſſary, ſince
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:009120_0018_1030F8D76C8BFDE0"/>
there is a falſe Spirit who makes it his grand Buſineſs to deceive. God has commanded us, <note n="z" place="bottom">1 John iv.</note> 
                        <q>not to believe every Spirit, but to try the Spirits, whether they are of God, becauſe many falſe Prophets are gone out into the World.</q> But how ſhall we try the Spirits, unleſs God has given us ſome Rule, Mark or Evidence to try them by?</p>
                     <p>"The Word ſpoken by Angels," <hi>ſays the Apoſtle,</hi>

                        <q>was ſteadfaſt, and every Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience received a juſt Recompence of Reward.</q> 
                        <note n="b" place="bottom">See Doct. Owen on this Text.</note> This implies that what Means ſoever God is pleaſed to uſe in the Revelation of his Will, he gives it a Certainty, Steadfaſtneſs, Aſſurance and Evidence, which our Faith may reſt in, and which cannot be neglected without the greateſt Sin. <q>The Word ſpoken by Angels, or the Law of Moſes, was ſteadfaſt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Divine Revelation is ſteadfaſt in Reſpect of them unto whom it is ſpoken being the Foundation of Faith and Obedience; the formal Reaſon of them, and the laſt Ground whereunto they are reſolved—On the Part of God, it is a ſtable and ſufficient Ground of Righteouſneſs, in proceeding to take Vengeance on them, by whom it is neglected. The Puniſhment of Tranſgreſſors, is a meet Recompence of Reward, becauſe the Word ſpoken unto them is ſteadfaſt. If the Revelation be not a ſtable, firm Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Faith and Obedience of Men, they cannot be juſtly puniſhed for the Neglect of it. There muſt then be ſome Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which ſufficiently proves a Revelation to be from God; otherwiſe he could not be juſt in puniſhing them for diſregarding it, ſince on ſuch a Suppoſition he would puniſh them for not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>that</hi> which he gave them no ſufficient Reaſon to believe which ſuits not with the Holineſs and Juſtice of God.</p>
                     <p>This Paſſage of Holy Scripture not only ſhews that immediate Revelations muſt be recommended by ſufficient Evidence to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; but it alſo expreſsly declares what this ſufficient Evidence is, which confirms the Truth of new Revelations. This whole emphatical Paſſage is an Inference from what the Apoſtle had diſcourſed about the Excellencies of Jeſus Chriſt, in the firſt Chapter, and runs thus. <q>Therefore we ought to give the more earneſt Heed to the Things which we have heard, leſt at any Time we ſhould let them ſlip. For if the Word ſpoken by
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:009120_0019_1030F8D900B44088"/>
Angles was ſteadfaſt, and every Tranſgreſſion and Diſobedience received a juſt Recompence of Reward; how ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great a Salvation, which at the firſt began to be ſpoken by the Lord, <hi>and</hi> was confirmed unto us by them that heard <hi>him;</hi> God alſo bearing them Witneſs, both with Signs and Wonders and with divers Miracles and Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, according to his Will?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Word here ſpoken by Angels means the Law of Moſes. The Phraſe, <hi>Great Salvation,</hi> which is placed in Contraſt or Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, means the Goſpel. Interpreters obſerve, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is called Salvation by a Metonymy of the Effect for the Cauſe, being the Revelation of the Grace of God, that bringeth Salvation; the Word that is able to ſave us.</p>
                     <p>God bore Witneſs to the Truth of this Revelation, not merely by ſtrong Impulſes, but by Signs, Wonders and Miracles, &amp;c. Thus we are aſſured, that Miracles, publick Miracles are the Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Seal which God gave to the Truth of the New Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament. And the Old was confirmed in the ſame Manner. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes proved the Truth of his Revelations in Oppoſition to the Magicians, and Korah and his Company by inconteſtible Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles. And Miracles were the Teſt, by which Elijah tried, and confounded the falſe Prophets, who pretended to Revelations in his Days. Whoever therefore pretends to new Revelations; whoever would aſſume a Power of making new Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, beſides thoſe contained in the Scriptures, muſt work proper Miracles in the Face of the World; otherwiſe their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations and Propheſies; their unſcriptural Terms of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be ſafely rejected becauſe deſtitute of God's Seal.</p>
                     <p>Perſons and Churches can attain to no higher Degrees of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and Purity, than ſincerely to believe, and practiſe the Directions God has given us in the Bible. All pretences to any Thing beyond—to any Thing beſides this divine Rule in Matters of Religion are vain and impious. Hence all new Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, let who will pretend to them; all new Terms of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, let who will invent them, yea tho' Eccleſiaſtical and civil Power ſhould join in Alliance to impoſe them with the greateſt Rigour, are to be rejected. Chriſtians ſhould regard and obey nothing as divine, till it is proved to proceed from God by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Miracles. The heated Fancies of Enthuſiaſts, and the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions and Impoſitions of zealous and perſecuting Bigots, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford

no ſufficient Warrant for our Faith. They are equally groundleſs, and ſhould be diſregard by all who profeſs to be the Followers of Chriſt. Human Authority and Number of Men are of no Weight here. Nothing but Miracles will prove Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for our religious Conduct to be divine.</p>
                     <p>God has not ſet his Seal of Miracles to any other Revelation relative to Salvation and our ordinary Duty; but that contained <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>in the Bible. If therefore Chriſtians will receive for divine, any Revelation which has not God's Seal upon it; if they will ſubmit to any unſcriptural Impoſitions of Men, they may thank themſelves for being deceived. Let them, in all Matters relating to Salvation, follow no Impulſes and Revelations; no Teachings and Inventions of Men, by whomſoever deviſed and impoſed, but thoſe contained in the Bible, or which may be derived from it by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>air Conſequences; and this will be an excellent Preſervative againſt Deluſions. No Revelations are to be looked for, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on to direct us in our Conduct, but thoſe delivered in the Scriptures; ſince God has confirmed and recommended theſe, and only theſe, by proper Miracles, which are his Witneſs, Mark, Evidence and Seal.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 But tho' God has given Mankind all the Directions for their Conduct in his written Word, which they are to expect; this does not ſuperlede the Neceſſity of the inward Work of the Spirit on their Hearts, in Order to bring them to be ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religious. There is no ſufficient Evidence to induce us to believe, that Sinners become religious, <hi>merely</hi> by Dint of their own Application to Duty; as Scholars learn Reading, Writing or Mathematicks, by cloſe Application to Study. Indeed the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures repreſent Men as being indifferent, or rather averſe to ſeek after God. They are not very ſenſible that they are Sinners, ſo as greatly to need his pardoning Mercy. <q>I hearkened and heard</q> ſays the Lord by his Prophet, <note n="c" place="bottom">Jer. viii.</note> to the Jews who were favoured with peculiar Advantages <q>but they ſpake not aright, no Man repented him of his Wickedneſs ſaying, What have I done? every one turned to his Courſe, as the Horſe ruſheth to the Battle.</q> They are naturally ſo fooliſh as to ſay in their Hearts "there is no God."

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009120_0020_1030F8DDF46DFF40"/>
but little affected with the important Truths and Facts, which are recorded in the Scriptures; ſo great is their natural Love of Sin; ſo ſtrong are their carnal Luſts. Thus they are <hi>inwardly</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and conſequently have Need of the <hi>inward</hi> Influences of the Spirit on their Hearts. Whatever then is neceſſary to bring Sinners <hi>effectually to know and love</hi> the Truth, as it is in Jeſus; and be <hi>duly enfluenced</hi> by it; all this is done by the Spirit of God in a Day of his Power.</p>
                     <p>The remarkable Succeſs of the Goſpel at firſt is at once a glorious Proof of the Divine Truth of Chriſtianity, and of the internal Operations of the Spirit on the Souls of true Converts— The Lord Jeſus Chriſt according to the Fleſh was of the Jewiſh Nation, which was hated by the Gentile World for ſundry Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. He was bro't up at Nazareth, which was a very mean and deſpicable Place. He appeared in ſuch low Circumſtances that his own Nation took Umbrage at his pretending to be their Meſſiah, and put him to Death as an Impoſter and Blaſphemer. After his Death, the greateſt Part of the Jews ſtill approved of their Conduct, reproaching him to the utmoſt. They took every Method they could deviſe, to prevent his Diſciples from preaching in his Name.</p>
                     <p>The Gentile Nations as they hated the Jews, and were ready to be immediately prejudiced aginſt any Doctrine which any of them ſhould advance; ſo they had loſt all rational Ideas about God, having from Time immemorial apoſtatiſed from his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to that of their deceaſed Heroes and Idol Deities. And as Mankind are greatly byaſſed by their Education, and early Connexions, ready to imitate their Parents, ond ſtrongly preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced in Favour of Cuſtoms, Habits and religious Ceremonies, which they receive from their Anceſtors; ſo the Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were moſt firmly attached, and violently bigotted to the Religion profeſſed in their reſpective Countries. They were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly fired againſt any that ſhould affront their Gods: yea ready to riſque their Lives as well as Eſtates in Defence of their Religion. <note n="d" place="bottom">Jer. ii. 10, 11.</note> "Paſs over," <hi>ſays the Lord by his Prophet,</hi>

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:009120_0020_1030F8DDF46DFF40"/>
the Gentile Nations profeſſed, in one or two Points; but was contrary to all the religious Syſtems then in the World, in the moſt material Things. And it was equally contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temper of Mankind, to their corrupt Inclinations and ſinful Practices. It was a Religion every where ſpoken againſt.</p>
                     <p>The chief Prieſts and Elders of the Jewiſh Nation were not more zealous againſt the Goſpel of Chriſt, than the Grandees of the Gentile World.—Their Orators harangued againſt it; their Poets ſatyriſed and bantered the Chriſtians, for worſhiping a crucified God. And the Civil Powers exerted their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in ſuppreſſing and perſecuting them to Death. Chriſtians were actually put to Death by Thouſands at Rome, in the moſt barbarous Manner, and wherever they could be found, for a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to prevent others from embracing their Religion. Yet this new Syſtem, this Goſpel of Jeſus of Nazareth who was crucified; this Scheme that was ſo contrary to all the religious Notions and Cuſtoms, which they had learned from their Parents, had recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from remote Antiquity, and to which they themſelves had always been habituated; this Goſpel, that was ſo contrary to the natural Inclinations, and vicious Practices of Mankind, dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpread and prevailed, conquered their Prejudicies, triumphed over all Oppoſitions; and in proceſs of Time ſubdued the large Roman Empire. The Emperors themſelves became obedient to the Faith of Chriſt. To whom is this to be aſcribed?</p>
                     <p>The chief Perſons employed in effecting this ſurpriſing Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution were twelve Fiſher-men of the deſpiſed Jewiſh Nation. One Saul who had been a violent Perſecutor joined himſelf to them, and became a Preacher. But the Moment he became a Diſciple of Jeſus of Nazareth, he loſt his Influence with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Friends. His Power and Inclination to perſecute forſook him at the ſame Inſtant.</p>
                     <p>As the Apoſtles were not bro't up in Courts but were plain Fiſher-men, their Succeſs was not owing to their being fine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, or the Arts of flattering Inſinuations. If they had been furniſhed with ſufficient Learning and Skill, or been Men of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Breeding and eaſy Manners; they were ſo poor in the World, having forſaken that little they poſſeſſed of its Riches at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their Lord and Maſter, that they could never have put ſuch Methods in Practice.</p>

This is the emphatical Expreſſion of Praiſe and Blame; For Men ſo ſtupidly forget their natural Impotence and Want, that Riches and Poverty ſeem often to take in their Imaginations the Place of Innocence and Guilt.</p>
                     <p>As the Apoſtles were poor, and deſtitute of worldly Power, they were naturally fearful and timerous, and <note n="f" place="bottom">Witneſs their cowardly forſaking their Maſter when he was apprehended and Peter's denying him thro' Fear.</note> of Conſequence did not ſubdue the Nations by Force of Arms, and then oblige them to embrace their Religion, like the Romans, and Mahometans.

                     <p>It is true indeed, that God wro't many glorious Miracles by the Apoſtles.

the Scribes and Phariſees. They were fully informed by the Soldiers of that moſt glorious Miracle of his riſing from the dead. This ſurpriſed, but did not convert them. They immediately determined to bribe the Soldiers to miſrepreſent the Fact. They ſaw the glorious Miracles which the Apoſtles wro't to prove that Jeſus of Nazareth was the very Chriſt, yet the greateſt Part of them obſtinately perſiſted in their Unbelief, and perſecuted his Diſciples with unrelenting Malice and Rage. Indeed if the Jews, like Nicodemus, had candidly examined the Miracles which were wro't, they might with him have been convinced that Jeſus of Nazareth was the true Meſſias. But Men are ſeldom diſpoſed to be candid, when a Change of their old Religion is propoſed. There are but few Men, who will be at the Pains, if left merely to themſelves, carefully to examine Religion. Now Miracles muſt be examined, and their Reality and Certainty cleared from all juſt Suſpicions of Impoſture, before they can convince the Judgment. And if they were ever ſo candidly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, they could not change and ſanctify Men's Hearts. The Evangeliſt John obſerves, <note n="g" place="bottom">John xii. 37, 38.</note> that tho' <q>Chriſt had done ſo many Miracles before the Jews, yet they believed not on him.</q> Now were not the Jews as likely to be influenced by the Miracles of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles who were of their own Nation as the prejudiced Gentiles? Had the Heathens ſo much more Candour and diligent Attention than the Jews, who from their great religious Advantages were vaſtly ſuperior to them? While the Evangeliſt laments over the Unbelief of the Jews who ſaw Chriſt's Miracles, he aſcribes true Faith to a divine Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on the Souls of Men. <q>Lord who hath believed our Report? and to whom hath the Arm of the Lord been revealed?</q> Could any Thing leſs than a divine Power on the Heart bring ignorant, ungodly, debauched Heathens to be eminently holy Saints?</p>

                     <p>The Apoſtles repeatedly refer this memorable Revolution which was bro't about by their Preaching to a much higher and nobler Cauſe than human Eloquence. They aſſure us, that however powerful and captivating the Charms of Oratory may be, they were not employed in effecting this glorious Change. Who ſhould know to whom this wonderful Succeſs of the Goſpel in the Heathen World was to be aſcribed, ſo well as Paul, the famous Apoſtle of the Gentiles, the chief Inſtrument of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion?

                     </p>
                     <p>Thus the Apoſtle Paul (as alſo the reſt of the Apoſtles) in the moſt expreſs Words, in ſundry Paſſages of his Writings, plainly aſcribes the Succeſs of the Goſpel to the internal Agency of God on the Minds of Mer. And if the Apoſtles had been much leſs expreſs in pointing us to the Spirit of God, no Man, that ſhould candidly conſider how great the Authority of Parents is with their Children; how difficult it is to perſuade Mankind, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to enquire into the Evidences of that Religion which they receive from their Anceſtors; how eaſily they learn Habits in their early Years; how ſtrongly they are prejudiced in Favour of Religious Cuſtoms to which they have once been habituated; how jealous they are about making any great Change; as alſo how little Influence Miracles had on the Jews; would eaſily give into it, that the ſudden Converſion of the Gentiles, to Chriſtianity and Holineſs, in Oppoſition to all theſe Prejudices, and to all temporal Advantages, could not have been effected without ſome internal Operations on their Hearts. It was ſurely God's own Almighty Arm that bro't about ſuch a glorious Revolution, by ſuch weak Inſtruments; and by ſuch unlikely Means, as the Fooliſhneſs of Preaching.</p>
                     <p>The Gentiles were devoted, even to the Height of Bigotry and Superſtition, to the Service of their Idol Deities; and they were likewiſe ſunk into the loweſt Depths of Vice and Debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, when Chriſt ſent his Apoſtles to preach this Goſpel to them. Theſe his faithful Miniſters preached a crucified Saviour to them; wro't many Miracles before their Hearers, to prove that both their Miſſion and Doctrine was divine; and ſhewed them from the Scriptures that all theſe Things were foretold by the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Prophets. God accompanied their Preaching with the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Influences of his Spirit, on the Souls of their Hearers. In a few Years, many Thouſands, in various Parts of the World, became as ominent for Virtue and Religion, as they had been before notorious for their ſcandalous Vices and Debaucheries.

                     <p>What abundant Evidences has God given to the Truth of the Chriſtian Religion! The moſt glorious Miracles have been wro't; the moſt ſurpriſing Prophecies have been actually fulfilled; the Truths of the Goſpel have been attended with the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Diſplays of Divine Power in changing the Tempers, and reforming the Lives of Thouſands and Millions of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Would the God of Truth, the righteous Governor of the World, give ſuch Evidences to confirm a Falſhood? Would be accompany a cunningly deviſed Fable with his Divine Power? Are Sobriety, Temperance.

                     <p>This is not to be accounted an unneceſſary Digreſſion, ſince there is ſo much Reaſon to fear that ſome of you, <note n="l" place="bottom">The Quakers are more eſpecially referred to here.</note> from your ſtrong Impulſes or Imaginations about a Jeſus within you, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>card Jeſus of Nazareth, the Son of Mary, who was crucified without the Gates of Jeruſalem.

But this they cannot know by Scripture.—Every true Chriſtian ſhould know his inward Call to Pray, or give Thanks, or perform any religious Duty or Service to God. But he can't know this from Scripture.</q> And hence you look for immediate Impulſes and new Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p>As you look for immediate Revelations and Impulſes, ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you are extremely confident you actually have them, and that not only your preſent Duty, but ſundry future Events are revealed to you by the Spirit or Saviour. It was neceſſary to ſtate your Opinions on this Point, thus largely, that the World may not be impoſed on by your ſpecious Pretences; and that all may clearly ſee what I diſpute againſt.</p>
                     <p>Your Notions plainly ſuppoſe, that the Scriptures are not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to teach you your Duty, and that God actually grants new Revelation; both which I have clearly demonſtrated to be falſe, and of Conſequence, I have intirely undermined the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of your whole Scheme. Therefore I would adviſe you, carefully to review what I have ſaid on theſe two Points.</p>
                     <p>But though I have ſaid quite enough to ſatisfy the more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Reader, I find it neceſſary, for the Inſtruction of others, to explain ſomewhat largely, how the Scriptures are quite ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to direct Men in particular Caſes, their Minds being duly illuminated by the Spirit of God, that I may effectually overthrow all your Pretences and Pleas.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. You readily allow that Mankind are rational Creatures, endowed with the Powers of Conſcience, Reflection, Memory and Reaſoning. If Men had no Conſcience they would not be Moral Agents. If they had no Memory, they could not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefitted by Revelation or any Kind: For what is not remembred cannot be a Rule of Conduct. This being granted, it will be eaſy to conceive, how the Scriptures come to refer to us in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and to anſwer our particular Caſes.—They are given to Mankind in general, in every Country, and in every Age, where they are ſent. The Laws and Truths, which they contain, don't reſpect particular Perſons as ſuch, but as they belong to general Characters, Ranks or Sorts, that are inſtructed, exhorted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, comforted, &amp;c. You are not mentioned by Name in the Laws of England, nor in the Laws of this Colony; yet if
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:009120_0025_1030F8EAD8D8FA28"/>
you violate them, and Proof is made, they are found to have a peculiar Reference to you. Can you comprehend this? If you can, you need be at no Loſs to underſtand, how the general Directions and Truths in the Scriptures refer to you, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, even as you belong to ſome general Character or Sort of Perſons. For the Scriptures are given to Mankind in general, juſt as the Laws of a Kingdom or Colony to all the Subjects be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to it, to one as much as another.</p>
                     <p>This Obſervation is ſo important that I would not by any Means have it miſunderſtood, and ſhall therefore add ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples to render it quite plain. When the third Command forbids Swearing, it has no more Reference to <hi>Robert</hi> than to <hi>Gilbert,</hi> no more Reference to them, than to any other Men. And thus the Law of the Colony againſt Swearing refers to all equally alike, forbidding one as much as another. It is ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in the Declarations, Promiſes and Threatnings of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Thus for Inſtance, <q>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; but he that believeth not ſhall be damned.</q> 'Tis not a Man's Name being John, or James, but his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, his being a Believer or an Unbeliever, that determines whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Promiſe or the Threatning belongs to him in particular.</p>
                     <p>If the Scriptures had been deſigned, not for Mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but for particular Perſons as ſuch, there muſt have been a diſtinct Bible for every Individual. Now we know God has granted but one Bible to Mankind, which is therefore the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral or common Bible to the whole Chriſtian World.</p>
                     <p>Even thoſe Paſſages, which give us an Account of particular Perſons, ſo far as they are appointed for our direct Inſtruction, can only teach us general Truths. The Perſons to whom they had an immediate Reference are dead, and they can't have this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Reference to any other Perſon, for this plain Reaſon, that<note place="bottom">Since I wrote the above Sentiments, I have the Pleaſure to find, that Doct.

of Sinners, and that "he will in no wiſe caſt out any that cometh unto him." On theſe or the like general Truths, Sinners are encouraged to believe in Chriſt. The Truths contained in the Scriptures are the Foundation, on which true Believers build their Hopes; the general Truths, which always were and always will be in the Scriptures.

There is little Faith in Chriſt and Diſtinctneſs in making Uſe of his Offices, and Men take but little Pains to know theſe Things.

The Temper and Character of true Saints is largely and plainly deſcribed in the Scriptures, and God has endowed Men with the Principle of Conſciouſneſs and Reflection, by which they may know their paſt Experiences and preſent Temper. There is no Need then of any new Revelations to inform them about their preſent State. The only Queſtion here is, <q>Have you this Temper and Character which the Scriptures declare belongs to all true Saints?</q> The Scripture-Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in this Caſe is not, <q>Look for an immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to aſſure you, that you are in a State of Grace," but <note n="ſ" place="bottom">2 Cor. xiii. 5.</note> Examine yourſelves, whether ye be in the Faith, prove your own ſelves, know ye not your own ſelves, that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates."

                     <p>Anſ. It is not ſaid, that the Spirit bears Witneſs to Men by <hi>revealing</hi> to them <hi>immediately,</hi> that they are in a State of Favour with God, or in the Number of his peculiar Children; nor can any ſuch Thing be fairly inferred from the Text. If this had been the Way Chriſtians came to know their good Eſtate, why did the Apoſtle give, even in this Chapter, ſo many Marks and Characters of true Saints?</p>
                     <p>As to the Meaning of the Text, obſerve the Apoſtle had aſſerted in this Chapter, that thoſe <q>who walked after the Spirit, in whom he dwelt, and who were led by him,</q> yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his ſweet Influences and obeying his Word, <q>were the Sons of God.</q> That in Conſequence of this high Relation, they were delivered from a guilty ſlaviſh Temper, and had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:009120_0027_1030F8EFFAAEFAD0"/>
the Spirit of Adoption or the Diſpoſition of Children; "Whereby, <hi>ſays he,</hi> we cry Abba Father." Thus their Spirits or Conſciences, being delivered from the Guilt of Sin, and the ſervile Yoke of the Moſaick Laws and ceremonial Inſtitutions by Chriſt, acted with the Freedom of Children, and bore Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that they were the Adopted Sons of God. Then follow theſe Words, <q>The Spirit itſelf beareth Witneſs with our Spirit, that we are the Children of God.</q> That is, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God teſtifies, bears Witneſs in his written Word, that thoſe who are led by the Spirit and have a filial Temper are the Children of God. And thus the Spirit of God joins with the well enlighten'd Conſcience of true Chriſtians, and teſtifies that they are the Children of God Thus the Spirit of God joins with the Conſcience of wicked Men under Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and, bears Witneſs that they are not his Children, but expoſed to his Wrath. Or the Meaning of the Text may be, the Spirit bears Witneſs that we are the Children of God, by the Graces which he works in us, which are his Seal, Mark, Evidence or Witneſs.</p>
                     <p>But if any will ſtill maintain, that they have had immediate Revelations to aſſure them of their gracious State; let them work Miracles to prove their Revelations came from God; otherwiſe, let them know they are in Danger of truſting their eternal Salvation on a Deluſion of Satan. It may perhaps be of ſome Service to ſome to inform them, that it is the Opinion of the Papiſts, and was confirmed by the Council of Trent, as may be ſeen at large in the ſixth Seſſion, that <q>no Man can ever know he is in a State of Grace, in this Life, unleſs it be ſpecially revealed to him by God.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p n="3">3. To proceed to another Inſtance, God has revealed by his Spirit in the Scriptures to Men, in general, that it is their Duty to pray frequently, to devote all convenient Opportunities to this important Exerciſe, and Reaſon teaches the ſame Thing. Conſequently every Man is directed to pray on all proper Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, as really as if he was called upon by Name in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Manner, ſo that none need to be at a Loſs for Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in this Point. You have no Need of a new Revelation to teach you, that you ſhould pray; nor when you ſhould; your own Conſcience and Reaſon, together with the general Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God's written Word plainly teach you this. And if you
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:009120_0027_1030F8EFFAAEFAD0"/>
venture to reſtrain Prayer until you have it immediately reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you by the Spirit; whenever your Conſciences are duly awakened you'll clearly ſee the Weakneſs of your Pretences.— If a Man may not pray, till he is immediately called to this Duty by the Spirit; then he may not pray for the Influences of the Spirit, which is contrary to Chriſt's Direction. <note n="u" place="bottom">Luke xi. 1,—13.</note> Then alſo it will be no Sin for him to neglect Prayer, a Notion which is very agreeable to the ungodly World, <note n="v" place="bottom">Job xxi. 13.15. Mal. iii. 14.</note> but quite contrary to the Scripture. And how ſhould a Man know that ſuch a Revalation came from God? Did God ever work any Miracles to prove the Truth of ſuch a Revelation? May not the Devil have various Ends in ſuggeſting to Perſons it is their Duty to pray, hereby leading them to neglect the plain written Word, and to look to him for Directions, when to perform this Duty. And will not Satan direct to very unſeaſonable Times.</p>

The Scriptures plainly tell what Sort of Men Biſhops or Miniſters ſhould be. <note n="w" place="bottom">See the Epiſtles to Timothy and Titus.</note> Let a Man then examine himſelf whether he has theſe Qualifications. In the Multitude of Counſellors there is Safety. 'Tis not reaſonable that a Man ſhould be the ſole Judge of his own Abilities and Qualifications. Hence, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has appointed thoſe who are already in the Miniſtry to look out for ſuitable Perſons for the Service of the Churches. They are required to examine Candidates for the Miniſtry, and judge of their Qualifications and Fitneſs for this Office. For every Man is allowed to be the beſt Judge of his own Occupation, Buſineſs or Calling. The Directions, then, to Miniſters, which were immediately ſent to Timothy as a Miniſter, are perfectly agreeable to common Senſe, and are Methods of proceeding in other Affairs of Life. <q>The Things which thou haſt heard of me among many Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, the ſame commit thou to faithful Men who ſhall be able to reach others alſo.</q>

                     </p>
                     <p>A Candidate for the Miniſtry, then, muſt apply to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to whom Chriſt has committed the Authority of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, judging and putting faithful Men into the Miniſtry; and if they find him duly qualified, the Scriptures plainly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect him to proceed. And when ſuch a Man is regularly cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:009120_0028_1030F8F70BF6AEE0"/>
by the People; and ordained according to the Rules of God's Word; he is made a Biſhop, Overſeer or Miniſter, over ſuch a People by the Holy Ghoſt. For the Holy Ghoſt has fitted him for this Office, being the Giver of his miniſterial Qualifications; and has given thoſe Rules or Directions in the written Word, according to which he has been fixed in his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral Charge. So that there is no Need of any new Revelation in this Caſe. All that is neceſſary here is, that Men have their Minds duly enlightened and influenced by the Truths which the Holy Ghoſt has revealed in the written Word.</p>
                     <p>If the Scriptures are perfect, what Need of any further Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections and Revelations? If theſe Caſes, if Men's Duty in all ordinary Caſes, be clearly revealed and pointed out in them, what Advantage could be received from a new Revelation? Would a new Direction about our Duty communicate any more Grace to us than the old one in the Bible? May not Men know their Duty, and yet not be willing to do it? Have there not been various Inſtances among you, wherein Perſons could not comply with your new Revelations, and thus you have been quite diſappointed.</p>
                     <p>Are not ſome diſguſted at the old Directions in the Bible, becauſe they are not agreeable to your preſent Inclination, as Ahab was at Micaiah; and long, with <hi>Balak,</hi> for a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, hoping it will be more agreeable to your Fancies? But is not this to hope that God is changed? Perhaps ſome think they are ſo eminent for their ſhining Gifts and Graces, that it is beneath them to ſtudy the Scriptures. Some are too indolent and lazy to ſearch this ſacred Book. They had rather have an immediate Revelation, or an Angel ſent from Heaven to inſtruct them. But will God gratify Men's Pride and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs?</p>
                     <p>There is no Doubt but God can give immediate Revelations, and ſend Angels from Heaven. But it is evidently contrary to his Wiſdom to do it, unleſs there was ſome Neceſſity for it. If God has ever interpoſed in ſuch a very extraordinary Way, it was doubtleſs to anſwer ſome important End, which could not have been well obtained by the common Inſtructions of the written Word The Light of Nature and the Reaſon of Things taught the Heathens, they were not to expect a God would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe

But what is there that is extraordinary in your Caſe? Or in the Caſes of Chriſtians in general? If God has really given us a perfect Rule in his holy Word, we may be ſure that he will not ſet it aſide to gratify the Humours of Men.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Theſe new Directions and Revelations would render the written Word of God in a great Meaſure uſeleſs to Mankind. What does it avail us, that God has given us his written Word, if it be inſufficient to direct us in the Duties, to which we may be called in our Chriſtian Courſe? What Advantage can we have from the Scriptures, if we muſt give Heed to ſome new Directions, which are to be daily communicated to us? And it has been obſerved as Matter of Fact, that as it is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to wait for new Revelations, than to ſearch the Scriptures; ſo there are but few of thoſe, who depend on immediate Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes, that ever take ſufficient Care and Pains to underſtand the Divine Law and Teſtimony. They are generally very ignorant of the true Meaning of the Word of God, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their great Pretences to extraordinary Revelations.</p>
                     <p>But if your Notions were right, there would have been no Need of the Scriptures at all unleſs of one ſhort Direction, viz. <q>To take Heed to the immediate Impulſes of the Spirit, or the Inſtructions of the Saviour.</q> For if your Revelations really come from the Spirit, they are as Divine, and as much to be regarded as any contained in the Bible. <note n="z" place="bottom">Barclay ſpeaks conſiſtently on this Point with his Scheme, when he would not have his divine Revelation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

If you ſhould pretend, you would try whether the Divine Spirit taught you right by the Scriptures: This would be prodigiouſly abſurd. For, do you think the Spirit of God can teach you wrong? Would you, ignorant Worms of the Duſt, attempt to call the Spirit of God to your Bar and try his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations?

Or would you ſuppoſe, that the Spirit of God was wiſer when he inſpired the Penmen of the holy Scriptures, than when he grants immediate Revelations to you? But this is a blaſphemous Abſurdity. How you will judge and try thoſe Revelations, you hold to be divine, by the Scriptures, I can't poſſibly deviſe.</p>
                     <p>Thus your new Revelations have a direct Tendency to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all Uſe and Benefit of the written Word of God. When therefore God has given us ſuch a large written Revelation of his Will in the Scriptures, and commanded us <q>to ſearch them;" "to continue ſtedfaſtly in them; <note n="a" place="bottom">2 Tim. iii. 15, 16, 17.</note> to take Heed to them;" aſſuring us "they are a perfect Rule, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the Man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed, unto all good Works:</q> This ſaps the very Foundation of all your new Revelations. The Abſurdity and Wickedneſs of forſaking the Word of God, and following other Spirits and Inſtructions is ſtrongly painted by the Prophet Iſaiah <note n="b" place="bottom">Iſaiah viii. 20.</note> 
                        <q>And when they ſhall ſay unto you ſeek unto them that have familiar Spirits, and unto Wizards that peep and mutter, ſhould not a People ſeek unto their God? To the Law and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them,</q> i. e. no true Light. For ſuch Perſons are deluded with imaginary or falſe Light which they receive from their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Spirits.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Your Notions about immediate Impulſes and Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons expoſe you to the Deluſions of Satan.

You have no certain Rule to judge by, on your Principles. And thus your Notions not admitting of any, evidently expoſe you to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of your greateſt Adverſary. You tamely deliver your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up to be led by him, and wait for his Directions.</p>
                     <p>Whereas on my Principles, there is a plain and certain Rule, the written Word, which has been confirmed by Miracles.

Eaſe and greater Rigour, as he does over the miſerable Nations of Africa, and as he did over the poor Indians in America, before the Arrival of the Engliſh. Hence it is no difficult Thing for an intelligent Chriſtian to find out, whoſe Cauſe Enthuſiaſts and Deiſts are promoting, while they declaim with great Warmth againſt Learning, and repreſent the learned as the worſt of all Men. <note n="c" place="bottom">See Lord Bolingbrook's Writings, as alſo Barclay, Frothingham, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note>

                     <p>It is certain that every Artifice which Wit and Malice can invent has been uſed againſt the Scriptures. Sometimes they have been ſecreted from the common People, by not being allowed to be tranſlated into vulgar Languages. Sometimes Religion has been cumbered with ſuch a Load of ſupplementary Traditions, Canons, Rites and Ceremonies, as among the Jews, Papiſts, &amp;c. that the pure written Word of God has been but little regarded. While ſome profeſſing Chriſtians have zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly contended about their own Additions and Appendixes, they have, as might be juſtly expected, overlooked or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the Scriptures themſelves, at leaſt <q>the more weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Matters contained in them, Judgment, Mercy, Faith and the Love of God,</q> and of Men too.—Since the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Letters when the Scriptures could be no longer ſecreted, Things have took another Turn. Many have become Deiſts and employed all their Subtilty and Malice in raiſing Cavils againſt the Scriptures, and hindering Men from belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

them. And though there have been many Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators who have done excellent Service in explaining the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet it is alſo evident that many have been as buſily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in perverting them by wrong Interpretations and forced Comments. <note n="e" place="bottom">See the voluminous Annotations of the Jeſuits, &amp;c.</note> 'Twould perhaps be injurious to ſuppoſe, that theſe Perſons were ſenſible they were under the Influence of Satan. No; Had they known this, they would not have been thus deceived. But is it not greatly probable that the Cavils againſt, and Perverſions of Scripture have in ſome Meaſure proceeded from his ſecret Influence; ſince he is very ſkilful, as appears from his tempting Chriſt, in putting wrong Senſes on the Scriptures, and is extremely enraged againſt them?</p>
                     <p>Where ſuch Methods were not likely to ſucceed, he has poſſeſſed Men's Minds with the Notion of immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, Impulſes, Viſions, Propheſyings, &amp;c. When Perſons give Heed to ſuch extraordinary Things, they ſoon imagine they are wiſer than their ordinary Teachers, and can't be much edified by the plain written Word. They have much more Light about themſelves, and others, and can ſee their Duty in any Particular Caſe more clearly, by having it immediately revealed to them. When Satan transformed into an Angel of Light, is permitted to deceive Men by falſe Light, no Doubt he ſuits his Revelations, Impulſes and Diſcoveries, to the diſordered Fancies of his Followers. And when the Palate and Stomach are greatly diſordered, wholſome Food will not be reliſhed. If Men's Heads become giddy and their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations wild; the plain Truths of the Goſpel will not pleaſe them. The Preaching of Chriſt crucified is a low Thing, for which they have no Reliſh. And indeed the plain general Truths of the Goſpel have no Tendency to eſtabliſh them in their fond Conceits. Nothing but Diſcourſes about won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Experiences, walking in God's Light, the <hi>Travel of</hi> the Church, and Revelations and <hi>Fellowſhips</hi> will nouriſh ſuch Perſons. The World never loved that a crucified Chriſt ſhould be preached. <note n="f" place="bottom">1 Cor. i. 23, 24.</note>

                     <p>Many of you, I believe, are not remarkably influenced by the powerful Agency of any Spirit. Whatever Truth there may be in what your famous Barclay <note n="g" place="bottom">See Barclay's Apol. Prop xi.</note> and others relate about extraordinary Things, that were evident among you at firſt in your Meetings; your Spirit has greatly withdrawn theſe pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Agitations from which you are called Quakers, or Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers. I heartily agree with this famous Apologiſt that your ſilent Meetings are as much for Edification as any among you. For the Inſtructions and Preaching of ſuch as pretend to be moved by the Spirit are ſo trifling and inſipid, that it is ſtrange how any rational Beings can gravely attend upon them. Since the Spirit your Speakers are moved and led by is evidently a fooliſh Spirit; I likewiſe agree with this Writer that the beſt Preparation for your Worſhip in general, is a Man's <q>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaining from his own Thoughts and Imaginations and from all the Self-Workings and Motions of his own Mind, as well in Things materially good as evil.</q> For if Men would allow themſelves to think and reaſon they muſt diſcover the groſs Abſurdity of ſuch Worſhip.—After all the fine Things Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clay has ſaid of your dumb Meetings, they are really but dumb Meetings, a Way of Worſhip more adapted to the Brutes that are not endowed with the Power of Speech, than to Mankind, whoſe Tongue is a Part of their Glory. When therefore you are about to transform yourſelves like Dumb Creatures that have no Underſtanding, it is no Doubt the moſt ſuitable Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for this unreaſonable Service to forbare thinking as much as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>The inward Light, which many of you harp ſo much on, is Nothing but mere natural Conſcience which remains in the worſt of Men.

                     </p>
                     <p>In ſome Inſtances your Impulſes and Revelations evidently proceed from Infirmities and Diſtempers of Body, as Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, Vapours, Diſtraction. And yet it is not impoſſible, that as Satan has a ſincere Hatred to Mankind, he may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove ſuch Times as they are leaſt able to obſerve and reſiſt his Temptations, in inſtil his Suggeſtions into their Minds that he may deceive them</p>
                     <p>But in many Caſes, I make no Doubt, there has been and ſtill is ſomething remarkable of a powerful and ſupernatural Agency on the Minds of ſome of you: That you really have Things revealed to you in an immediate Way, and have ſtrong Impulſes on your Minds far beyond what mere Imagination could poſſibly work. And I think it appears evident from what has been ſaid, that all ſuch Revelations and Impulſes ordinarily come from Satan. For ſince the Scriptures, are a ſufficient and perfect Rule; all other Revelations are needleſs, unwarran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table and contrary to Scripture. God has not confirmed any other Revelation relative to Salvation with Miracles. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they don't bear his Mark and Seal. Now ſince they don't come from God, from whom can they come, but from the Evil Spirit.</p>
                     <p>Ob. It is ſaid in Joel, <q>It ſhall come to paſs afterwards that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Fleſh, and your Sons and your Daughters ſhall Propheſy, your old Men ſhall dream Dreams and your young Men ſhall ſee Viſions.

                     <p>Now, if this Prophecy was fulfilled in the Apoſtle's Time, what immediate Reference can it have to us? 'Twas foretold that Sarah ſhould have a Son. When Iſaac was born this Prophecy was fulfilled. Can any Woman now a Days infer from this, that ſhe herſelf ſhall have a Son? With equal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety this Prophecy of Joel, which was fulfilled in Peter's Time, is brought to prove, we may expect Men and Women to be endowed with the Gift of Prophecy in our Day.</p>
                     <p>At the firſt planting of Chriſtianity in the World, before Churches were regularly gathered, the Nations were quite ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Goſpel; and being devoted to their own ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious Notions of Religion were extremely prejudiced againſt all Attempts that were made to change their religious Ceremonies, eſpecially againſt the Followers of Jeſus of Nazareth who was crucified. The firſt Preachers of Chriſtianity were placed in the moſt extraordinary Circumſtances, having to attack all the Prejudices and Ignorance and Wickedneſs of the whole World, and that, without the Countenance of any civil Authority. Nay, the civil Powers exerted themſelves to the utmoſt, to prevent the Spread of Chriſtianity, perſecuting the Preachers of the Goſpel to Death.</p>
                     <p>'Twas therefore agreeable to the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God to endow the firſt Preachers of the Goſpel with extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Gifts, ſuited to the extraordinary Circumſtances in which they were placed. Among theſe extraordinary Gifts that of Prophecy was one. Their Prophecies, when they were fulfilled, afforded a ſtriking Proof, to thoſe who were acquainted with them, of the Truth of their Doctrine. The Prophets who were raiſed up in the firſt Days of the Goſpel were likewiſe endowed with the Power of working Miracles, they could give ſupernatural Evidence that they were divinely inſpired ſufficient to ſatisfy an honeſt Enquirer. With Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to theſe the Apoſtle gives that Direction, <q>Deſpiſe not Propheſyings.</q> So that they are greatly miſtaken, who imagine this Text has any ſpecial Reference to our Times. 'Tis readily granted there were Prophets in the firſt and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Days of the Goſpel, and Chriſtians were warned not to deſpiſe their Propheſyings. And what then? what would

                        </gap> from this? That there ſhould be Prophets now, when the Scriptures are compleated, and Churches regularly ſettled and ſupplied with a learned, orthodox and godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry? By the ſame Method of Reaſoning you may alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that becauſe Nehemiah, his Servants and the Men of the Guard, in an extraordinary Time, did not put off their Cloaths, except for waſhing, you ſhould not put off yours now, but keep them on Night and Day.</p>
                     <p>But would you in ſober Blood attempt to prove from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that there are Prophets, when it is certain and plain Matter of Fact, that there are none? Your Reaſoning, if it proved any Thing, would prove that the Scriptures are not true, ſince it is inconteſtably evident, that they are not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in your Senſe of them. For where are your Prophets? What Events have they foretold? Have their Predictions been fulfilled?</p>
                     <p>I have heard of many and read ſundry Propheſies in late Years. Some of you, I have been informed, propheſied, that the French would deſtroy New-England, becauſe its Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants would not turn to you. Others of you 'tis ſaid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied that ſuch and ſuch Perſons would not die. Others have propheſied, that in a ſhort Time the Lord would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert all our Churches to your Notions. But theſe Propheſies have been moſt plainly contradicted by the Event and proved to be falſe.</p>
                     <p>A remarkable Diſcovery of the Falſehood of your Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies happened ſome Time ſince in your predicting that Mr. Elihu Dagget was to be a Miniſter among you. This was revealed to ſundry. They examined their Revelations by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſh Rules and found them to be right. They were ſo confident of the Truth of their Revelations, ſo certain their Predictions would be fulfilled, that they appointed a Day to ordain him. Vaſt Crouds of People aſſembled to ſee his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination. But Mr. Dagget himſelf refuſed to be ordained, ſaying it was not revealed to him, that he muſt be their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter. They exhorted him, and prayed over him, 'till they were tired; but he could get no Light; ſo that they were obliged to return home ſhamefully diſappointed, proving themſelves to be falſe Prophets.

to have complied; ſince the Preparation of the Heart in Man, and the Anſwer of the Tongue is from the Lord. He never ſuffered any of his Words to fall to the Ground. God was never deceived nor fruſtrated.</p>
                     <p>As to what is reported about your foretelling that ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons would be converted, which Predictions are pretended to be fulfilled, this may be contrived and publiſhed to give ſome Reputation to your Scheme among ſome undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Perſons; but is in reality a Piece of Deluſion. For you cannot know that ſuch particular Perſons are converted. It is great Preſumption for you to pretend to know certainly who are truly converted, when God has declared in the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Terms, <note n="i" place="bottom">Jer. xvii. 8, 9.</note> that <q>the Heart is deceitful above all Things and deſperately wicked, who can know it? I the Lord ſearch the Heart.</q> So that this is to prove a Prediction to be certainly fulfilled by an Event, which you cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>If you ſhould pretend God has revealed it to you they are converted, then work Miracles to prove the Revelation comes from God, and not from the Devil. What ſignifies your Witneſſing for one another, and Fellowſhip with another's Spirits? How often have you witneſſed for ſome, whom you muſt own have turned Apoſtates, and however loth you may be muſt witneſs againſt them. When you bear certain Witneſs, that a Man is converted, and afterwards certain Witneſs that he is not, this ſhews your Witneſs is not worth a Straw. How often have you been deceived in your Declarations about Converts?</p>
                     <p>For any Thing that I ſee, the Devil might reval it to you, that ſuch and ſuch Perſons would be converted; and then, transforming himſelf into an Angel of Light might deceive them, with a falſe Converſion to carry on his Deſigns the more plauſibly.</p>

                     <p>There are ſundry Perſons belonging to theſe Sects, who will not own that they look for immediate Revelations and Impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, but for the Influences of the Spirit to enlighten their Minds in the Scriptures. They call the Impreſſions they have on their Minds the Operations of the Spirit. 'Tis neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:009120_0033_1030F9040D58F248"/>
to point out ſome Things, which they look on as certain Evidences their Impreſſions came from the Spirit of God, and which yet are no good Proof at all.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Some imagine that when a Scripture is impreſſed on their Minds, this Impreſſion muſt certainly be from God. They think Satan cannot meddle with Scripture. But this is a great Miſtake. Did not Satan enforce his Temptations on our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our by Texts of Scripture? and is it not evident from the Narrative of John Lewis, that he was impoſed on and delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Satan ſuggeſting and impreſſing Texts of Scripture on his Mind?</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Others look upon the Power or Force, with which a Scripture comes to them and is impreſſed on their Minds, as an unqueſtionable Evidence, that the Impreſſion is from God. Is not this the chief Evidence which many of you truſt to, when you would prove that your Impreſſions and Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Scripture are from above? Have not ſundry of you ſeparated from us, becauſe it was ſtrongly impreſſed on your Minds that you muſt leave us? Theſe Impreſſions are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo powerful as greatly to affect your Bodies. Hence your ridiculous Motions, Rockings, Twiſtings, Jumpings &amp;c. in your pretended religious Meetings and Exerciſes.</p>
                     <p>There is no Doubt to be made but the Spirit of God could impreſs divine Truths with ſuch Force on our Minds, as would not only greatly affect, but even diſſolve our weak Frame. But as he knows our Make, there is Reaſon to think that he does not ordinarily exert much Force, ſo as violently to agitate the Body in beſtowing his converting and ſanctifying Influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Viſions of Iſaiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Paul and John, were very extraordinary indeed, and not to be commonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Such Extraordinaries are not neceſſary for Salvation. The Divine Spirit enlightens the Mind in a gentle Manner which but ſeldom agitates the Body. Divine Light poured into the Mind diſcovers the Way, the Man's Judgment is convinced, his Objections vaniſh, he readily complies. So that there is no Need of any forcible Preſſure on his Body to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him. Whereas when Satan leads Perſons to any Thing, ſince he has no Divine Light to diſcover Truth to them, it is natural to ſuppoſe he uſes, if permitted, a Sort of a Force,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:009120_0034_1030F9096A2922F8"/>
ſomething like the Charming or Enchanting of Serpents, when they bring Birds into their very Mouths.</p>
                     <p>This Matter, I think, is fully illuſtrated and proved by the following Scriptures. <note n="k" place="bottom">1 Kings xix. 11.13.</note> 
                        <q>And behold the Lord paſſed by, and a great and ſtrong Wind rent the Mountains, and brake in Pieces the Rocks before the Lord; <hi>but</hi> the Lord <hi>was</hi> not in the Wind: and after the Wind an Earthquake; <hi>but</hi> the Lord <hi>was</hi> not in the Earthquake: and after the Earthquake a Fire; <hi>but</hi> the Lord <hi>was</hi> not in the Fire: and after the Fire a ſtill ſmall Voice. And it was <hi>ſo</hi> when Elijah heard <hi>it</hi> that he wrapped his Face in his Mantle and ſtood in the Entring in of the Cave.</q> The Lord was not in thoſe powerful ſhocking Convulſions. But he was with the ſtill ſmall Voice.</p>
                     <p>When the Spirit was pleaſed to grant the Church immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Revelations and Prophecies, in the firſt Days of the Goſpel, the Apoſtle gives the following Directions. <note n="l" place="bottom">1 Cor. xvi. 30.32.</note> 
                        <q>If <hi>any Thing</hi> be revealed to another that ſitteth by, let the Firſt hold his Peace. For ye may all Prophecy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted. And the Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets.</q> Which Clauſe Dr. Doddridge thus paraphraſes; <q>There is no Impoſſibility of doing this; <hi>for</hi> the Spirit of God that inſpires you, is not a wild irreſiſtible Impulſe, like that by which the Pythian Prieſteſs, and others who profeſs Inſpiration and Prophecy among the Gentiles, pretend to be agitated; but <hi>the-Spirits</hi> or Inſpirations of the Chriſtian Prophets produce thoſe calm Emotions which <hi>are ſubject to the Prophets.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Satan is a very powerful Being, having been one of the Chief of the Angels, that "excell in Strength." We read <note n="m" place="bottom">11 Theſſ. ii. 9, 10.</note> of <q>one whoſe coming is after the Working of Satan, with all Power;" and that "ſome would be given up to <hi>ſtrong</hi> Deluſions.</q> So that the Power, Strength or Force, with which any particular Text of Scripture is ſuggeſſed to a Man, and borne in upon his Mind, cannot be juſtly looked upon as a certain diſtinguiſhing Evidence, that the Impreſſion is from God.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Hence, we learn, what to think of that which others mention as a Mark that their Impreſſions come from God, viz.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:009120_0034_1030F9096A2922F8"/>
                        <q>that they have ſtrong Oppoſition againſt them, that they ſtrive and ſtruggle to reſiſt, but at length are compelled by the Force and Weight which they feel, to yield.</q> 'Tis to be obſerved, that all this Oppoſition, which theſe Perſons ſpeak of, is after they have had their Impreſſions, after they ſee and know that they are clearly taught their Duty in ſuch Inſtances. But the Spirit of God teaches Men, by renewing their Minds, and enlightning their Underſtandings in the Truth. Theſe Operations of the Spirit remove Men's Oppoſition to the Truth. So that it is ſtrange that Perſons ſhould feel this Oppoſition to the Teachings of the true Spirit, and feel it exceeding ſtrong too; yea, and to be overcome at laſt rather by ſome unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Force upon the Body, than Light and Reaſon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to the Mind.</p>
                     <p>There is a Diſpoſition in Men, by Nature to reſiſt the Spirit, <hi>That is,</hi> their ſinful Luſts and Inclinations are contrary to God and Holineſs. The Oppoſition of Sinners to the Spirit ariſes from their Luſts and Ignorance. But the Oppoſition which theſe Perſons mention, ſo far as I can judge from their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of it, is the Oppoſition, their better Reaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience make againſt their Impreſſions. I wiſh this Matter may be as ſeriouſly and candidly conſidered, as its Importance re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.—Theſe are two very different Sorts of Oppoſition, and I think might be clearly diſtinguiſhed, if thoroughly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined.</p>
                     <p>Oppoſition to the Admonitions of the Spirit by the written. Word ſet home on the Heart, becauſe they are contrary to Men's ſinful Luſts, is very common. It is often reproved in the Scriptures, and is beyond all Controverſy a very ſinful Oppoſition. But there may alſo be, yea often are ſtrange and abſurd Impreſſions on Men's Minds, which their Conſcience and Reaſon can't but oppoſe. They don't really ſee the Thing impreſſed on their Minds to be right, and they have not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Evidence that the Impreſſion comes from God. For this would ordinarily remove their Oppoſition, as in Paul's Caſe. If therefore the Oppoſition ariſeth from Men's Reaſon and Conſcience, I don't ſee, how they can make this any Mark at all of the Impreſſions coming from God. I ſhould rather think, it was an Evidence of its coming from Satan; ſince the Spirit of God conſtantly applies, in his teaching Men
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:009120_0035_1030F90B089B2FA0"/>
by Scripture, to Men's Conſciences, and ſhews them ſufficient Reaſons to prove that the Things, he urges them to, are right; and thus leaves them without Excuſe. Whereas Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan hurries Men along blindfold.</p>
                     <p>Virgil, the celebrated Heathen Poet, deſcribes the Sibyl, the Prieſteſs of the Idol-Apollo, as ſtruggling violently under the powerful Impreſſions of the Evil Spirit. They who were poſſeſſed with Evil Spirits in the Days of Chriſt, ſtruggled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their violent Agitations, as we are informed by the Evangeliſts. John Lewis ſay, <q>I did ſeveral Times between the firſt Impulſe and the Execution of the horrid Deed ſtrive to reſiſt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>But the Apoſtles, when they were called by Chriſt, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately without manifeſting any Oppoſition obeyed his Divine Call. Who was a more violent Oppoſer of Jeſus of Nazareth, and his Followers, than the Apoſtle Paul in his Unbelief? Yet as ſoon as he was commanded by Chriſt, he immediately obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We don't read, that he <hi>ſtrove</hi> and <hi>ſtruggled</hi> againſt the Divine Command. His Oppoſition though very violent before, was then inſtantly removed. He immediately obeyed the heavenly Viſion. Is it not aſtoniſhing that Oppoſition to Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſhould be made a certain Evidence of their coming from God!</p>
                     <p n="4">4. Others imagine that their ſuffering Reproach for fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing their Impreſſions, is a good Proof of their proceeding from the divine Spirit; ſince the World has a Diſreliſh for the Things of the Spirit of God. Hence, ſome make a great Outcry about Peſecution, as if they were violently abuſed and perſecuted, becauſe they don't enjoy ſuch great Immunities and Privileges, as the regular eſtabliſhed Churches in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony. They magnify theſe Things, and the Reproaches and Ridicule, they meet with for their Follies, are very grievous Oppreſſions and ſore Perſecutions. Whereas there is no Part of the World that enjoys Liberty more fully than the Britiſh Colonies. We may ſay with the greateſt Propriety in the Words of Peter, <note n="n" place="bottom">1 Peter iii. 13.</note> 
                        <q>Who is he that will harm you if ye be Followers of that which is good.</q> According to him it is not true, that the World is always diſpoſed openly to perſecute
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:009120_0035_1030F90B089B2FA0"/>
Men becauſe they are good. In Times of Perſecution, good Men are repreſented as Evil, before they are perſecuted.</p>
                     <p>The Oppoſition and Enmity, which natural Men have to the Goſpel in Chriſtian Countries, and in Lands of Liberty, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts rather in the Ignorance of their Minds, and Contrariety of their Hearts, Wills and Luſts to God and Chriſt, than in open Perſecution of true Saints. There are many unconverted Perſons who on one Account and another have a great Regard for Men, who are eminently religious. The Children of Heth, who were Heathens eſteemed and honoured Abraham. <note n="o" place="bottom">Gen. xx. 3.</note> Saul who was a wicked King honoured the holy Prophet Samuel.</p>
                     <p>But it is certain, that while Reaſon remains in the World, Follies and Inconſiſtencies in Conduct will expoſe Men to Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicule. There is no Poſſibility of helping this. But what ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Virtue there is in being thus ridiculous, I am yet to learn. <q>What Glory, <hi>ſays Peter,</hi> is it if when ye be buffeted for your Faults, ye take it patiently?</q> Moſt certainly then there is much leſs Glory, when you bear your deſerved Reproaches with great Impatience; and retaliate them fourfold with Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs and Railing, which your Neighbours can teſtify is your conſtant Practice.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. Others look on the great Zeal with which they are filled, in Conſequence of their Impreſſions, as a certain Proof of their coming from God. It is readily granted, that Men ſhould be very zealous about Religion, and that good Men, who are quickened by the Spirit, are filled with much holy Zeal. This Zeal proceeds from the ſaving Knowledge of God through Chriſt, and diſpoſes the Man who has it to have a tender Concern for the divine Glory, and hearty Charity or Love for Mankind, and it is always regulated by the Rules con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the written Word of God. Right Zeal, like the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is from above, ſhould be firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, and eaſy to be intreated, full of Mercy and good Fruits, without Partiality and without Hypocriſy.</p>
                     <p>It ſhould be remembered, that the ſenſible Motions of the Blood and animal Spirits, which ordinarily accompany Zeal, depend in a great Meaſure on the Conſtitution of the Body; and will be very different in different Perſons, who are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly religious according to their reſpective Conſtitutions. Hence,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:009120_0036_1030F90C97E9AC70"/>
it is difficult to judge of the Affections of others, from the viſible Diſcoveries, they make of their Zeal. The Apoſtle Peter was a Man of a natural warm Make: The Apoſtle John was of a meek and gentle Spirit. He was of a calm and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick Temper; yet it does not appear that the zealous and forward Peter was a more eminent Saint, or really more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in Religion, than the meek and humble John. Each of them had his peculiar Gift in which he excelled. Peter had been much to blame if he had diſpiſed John.</p>
                     <p>The Scriptures and the Reaſon of Things inform us, there is a falſe Zeal as well as a true. Perſons may be very zealous about their Religion, who are quite Strangers to the Influences of the holy Spirit. Were not Baal's Prophets extremely zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in Elijah's Time about their <hi>own Religion?</hi> about the Credit of their Worſhip and favourite Idol? And was not Jezebel equally engaged? Jehu does not appear to have been ſincerely religious; yet he was ready to call upon others to come and ſee his Zeal for the Lord. Were not the Scribes and Phariſees ignorant of Chriſt the Lord of Glory? yet who were more zealous than they? How much engaged were they to make Proſelytes, and encreaſe their Number? They would compaſs Sea and Land to gain one new Diſciple. Yea, in the Height of their ignorant Zeal, they crucified Chriſt himſelf. As true Zeal is always an Attendant of true Religion; ſo falſe Zeal conſtantly accompanies Deluſion, otherwiſe the Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit would be very imperfect. And indeed there is no Branch of the Chriſtian Character that is more eaſily, and commonly Counterfeited than Zeal, as appears from the foregoing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.</p>
                     <p>Pride and Self-Will in Men, if they are oppoſed, will often make them zealous. Oppoſition ſtirs Men's Angry Paſſions, and frequently enflames them with burning Zeal againſt their Adverſaries.</p>
                     <p>It is certain that Perſons may do a great Deal at heating their own Fancies, and kindling the Fire of Enthuſiaſm by their own Induſtry and Labour. Thoſe who have not been acquainted with ſuch Things, would be ſurprized to ſee what labouring and toiling will do at raiſing forced Tranſports. And may not Satan be ready to blow this Wild-Fire.

But all ſober, underſtanding Chriſtians ſee there is ſomething extremely odious in this mechanical or forced Zeal. Such Zeal is doubtleſs one of the greateſt Indignities that can be offered to a jealous God.</p>
                     <p>But not to enlarge on this, ſince extraordinary Heat and Zeal may proceed from a warm Imagination worked up by Men's own Labour and Induſtry; ſince it may be raiſed by the Agency of Satan; it cannot be allowed to be any certain Mark that the Impreſſions, which it accompanies, come from God. When Men's Zeal ſtirs them up to Extravagancies, it may be looked on as an Evidence, they are not then moved by divine Influences. For the Spirit has expreſsly revealed that <q>God is not the Author of Confuſion but of Peace, as in all Churches of the Saints.</q>

For it is not probable, that Satan, the proud Spirit, would try to make Men truly humble. But it is one Thing for Men to be really humble, and another to ſay and profeſs they are ſo</p>

in Pride, it renders a Perſon ſo like the Devil, that few or none will ever profeſs they are proud. According to my Obſervations, Men generally make ſome Pretenſions to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; ſo that your profeſſing that your Impreſſions make you very humble, is no ſufficient Evidence that you are ſo. When a Man profeſſes to be very humble, this is the ſame Thing as to profeſs in other Words, that he is a very excellent Chriſtian. And may not a Man who has much ſpiritual Pride, and only a Shew of Humanity profeſs this?</p>
                     <p>If you were really humble, how came you to be ſo wiſe in your own Conceits, and to have ſuch a high Opinion of your own Gifts, Experiences and Graces? And ſo much Contempt for all but yourſelves? Whence is it, that you don't pay any Regard to the Reaſons and Judgment of any Man or Number of Men, let them be never ſo wiſe, learned and godly; but tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple on all Churches, and their Determinations, but your own, with the greateſt Diſdain? Did you not make this one grand Plea for your Separations from us, that our Churches were not pure enough for ſuch holy Perſons as you? Were you not afraid ſuch eminent Saints as you would be poluted by having Communion with ſuch Sinners, as you think we are? Is it not then a downright barefaced Inſult on common Senſe, for you to pretend to Humility, when your whole Conduct loudly declares that you are lifted up beyond Meaſure with Pride? But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably it was powerfully impreſſed on your Minds, you were more excellent than your Neighbours. If you had ſuch an Impreſſion on your Minds, your own Conſcience and Reaſon doutleſs oppoſed it at firſt, becauſe there were ſundry Things that rendered it very improbable. But there was ſomething ſo agreeable in the Impreſſion, you at length gave Way to it, and now act upon it.</p>
                     <p>Now can you think, can any Body believe, that an Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that has puffed you up with Pride, and inſpired you with Diſdain towards Thouſands that are really ſuperior to you, could come from God?</p>
                     <p>What tho' you deſpiſe fine Cloaths, and new Faſhions, and exclaim againſt them? You may take as much Pride in rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them, as others do in following them. Reaſon and common Senſe plainly direct Perſons to appear in that Dreſs, in which they are likely to be leaſt ſtared at, and talked
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:009120_0037_1030F90E27360278"/>
about; ſince there are but few, who have Merit enough to ſupport an extraordinary Character. When Perſons dreſs above or below what is accounted ſuitable for their Eſtates and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in the Place and Age where they live, they are Offenders againſt this Rule, and are often puniſhed by Ridicule.</p>
                     <p>Modeſt Apparel is recommended by the Scriptures, which are the Standard of good Senſe, as well as Religion. Unaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected Neatneſs is celebrated as the Perfection of Dreſs by the beſt Judges. Women who are really beautiful need not, and thoſe who are truly virtuous will not, greatly ſtudy to outdo others in Finery and Faſhions; unleſs they have a ſtrong Tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Vanity, or a wrong Taſte. They would not be the leſs amiable, tho' they ſhould not conform to the Faſhions, that are contrary to common Senſe, private Beauty and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Conveniency. But if ſuch, as have but little Virtue, and Beauty, ſhould try to recommend themſelves by extravagant Finery, dreſſing even beyond the Faſhion, however inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient and ridiculous it may be, they would commonly find themſelves ſadly diſappointed; ſince hereby, they would make a glaring Diſcovery of their exceſſive Vanity, Want of Senſe and true Taſte. Extravagance in Dreſs is ſtill more abſurd in Men. What a ſorry Character do Pops ſuſtain? 'Tis a Pity they are not always mortified by Neglect or Ridicule, which they ſo juſtly merit with great Pains and Expence.</p>
                     <p>But ſince Mankind are proud of many Things beſides Cloaths, it will not follow, that all, who rail againſt Finery and new Faſhions are truly humble. Some may do this to make a Righteouſneſs of their Zeal againſt Foppery. Some may from merefullenneſs put on Rags, when they ſee others glare in Robes. But in true Humility the Mind is humbled, bro't to a meek and lowly temper. Such Perſons are poor in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, diffident of their own Wiſdom, and ready to eſteem others better than themſelves, but not forward to exerciſe themſelves in great Matters, or Things too high for them. <note n="r" place="bottom">Pſalm cxxxi.</note>

                        <p>He was the eldeſt Son of an ancient, rich, and honorable Family, and therefore born to an opulent Fortune: though his Father, when he ſaw his turn of Mind, very prudently left him but a Part of it, and that in the Hands of his younger Brother. But though he ſtill had an ample Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made for him, he voluntarily deprived himſelf of all the Conveniences and even the Neceſſaries of Life. He choſe one obſcure Hole or Cottage after another to live in, and often mixed with Beggars, whom he reſembled ſo much in his Cuſtoms, ſordid and tattered Garb, and whole Manner of his Life, that he was ſometimes taken for one, and was never better pleaſed, than when this expoſed him in the Streets and Ways to Deriſion and Contempt. Poverty was what he ſo much affected, that though he applied to his Brother for what his Father had left him, yet that he might not have the Appearance of being rich, he choſe not to take it as what was legally due to him, but to ſupplicate for it in the humbleſt Terms, as for an Alms freely beſtowed upon a miſerable Object that had nothing of his own. And yet in his laſt Will, he diſpoſed of it as his own to various Uſes as he thought fit, eſpecially for the Benefit of thoſe who had been Sufferers for the Janſeniſts Cauſe. For ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of the laſt Years of his Life he ſeemed to make it his Buſineſs to contrive Ways to weaken, or harraſs, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture his Body, and thereby haſten his own Death. Whilſt he gave away his Income to the poor, he himſelf vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily endured all the Evils and Hardſhips which attended the Extremity of Want and Poverty. Mean and wretched was his Garb, black Bread, Water and Herbs, but without Oil, Salt, or Vinegar, or any Thing to give them Savour, was his only Suſtenance, and that but once a Day. He lay upon the Ground, and was worn away with continual Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. After his Death, were found his Hair Shirt, an Iron Croſs, a Girdle, Stomacher and Bracelets of the ſame Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal,
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:009120_0038_1030F9116A5B3B30"/>
all beſtuck with ſharp Points. Theſe were the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Penitence, with which he was wont to chaſtiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the plain Marks of which he bore in his Body. By ſuch a Courſe he brought himſelf not only into great Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Body, but into Diſorders of Mind: And this, which was the natural Effect of his Manner of Living, he attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the Influence of the Devil, whom God had in juſt Judgment permitted to puniſh him for his Sins. And in enquiring into the Cauſes of divine Diſpleaſure, he fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, that he had ſtill too great a Love for <hi>human Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and Knowledge, and therefore from thenceforth did all he could to diveſt himſelf of it, and would have ſold his well furniſhed Library, if he had not been prevented by ſome of his Friends, whoſe Intereſt it was to preſerve it. For two Years together he refuſed to come to the holy Supper, under Pretence that it was not lawful for him to come, God having required him to abſtain from it: And it was with great Difficulty that he was brought to it at laſt, by the Threatnings and even Reproaches of his Confeſſor. Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that no Kind of Miſery might be wanting to him, he choſe for his Companion to dwell with him in his Cottage, a Man that was looked upon to be crazy, and who treated him in the moſt injurious Manner. He did all he could to hide himſelf from his Friends in one ſorry Cottage after another, and about a Month before his Death fixed himſelf in a little Lodge in the Corner of a Garden, expoſed to the Sun and Wind. When by ſuch Severities he had brought himſelf into an univerſal bad habit of Body, and it was viſible to his Friends, that if he continued in that Courſe he would not long ſupport under it; a Phyſician was called in, who only deſired him to remove to a more commodious Habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to allow himſelf more Sleep, and a better Diet, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to take nouriſhing Broths for reſtoring his enfebled Conſtitution. But all the Perſwaſions of his Phyſician, Confeſſor, and of his Friends, and the Tears of an only Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, could not prevail with him to follow an Advice ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable and practicable; though he was aſſured, that if he uſe the Method there was great Hope of his Recovery, and that his Life could not be preſerved without it. And when at laſt to ſatisfy their importunity, he ſeemed ſo far to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:009120_0039_1030F913045CDDF8"/>
as to be willing to take ſome Broth, it was only an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of complying, for he took Care to give ſuch Orders, to the Perſon who was to prepare it for him, that it really yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed little or no Nouriſhment. Thus it was manifeſt, that he had determined to haſten, as much as in him lay, his own Death. And accordingly he told his Confeſſor, that this Life had nothing in it to make it worth a Chriſtian's Care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</p>
                        <p>However ſuch Things procured him ſo extraordinary a Reputation that he has paſſed for one of the greateſt Saints that ever appeared in the Chriſtian Church. No ſooner was he dead, but an innumerable Multitude of People ran to his Corpſe, ſome of whom kiſſed his Feet, others cut off Part of his Hair as a Remedy againſt all Manner of Evils,; others bro't Books or Bits of Cloth to touch his Body, as believing it filled with a divine Virtue. Thus were they prepared to believe and expect the moſt wonderful Things—But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Conſiſtency with Reaſon be ſuppoſed, that God ſhould extraordinarily interpoſe by his own divine Power, to do Honor to the Bones and Aſhes of a Man weak and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious to a Degree of Folly, and who was knowingly and willingly acceſſory to his own Death.</p>
                        <p>How different is this from the beautiful and noble Idea of Piety and Virtue which the Goſpel furniſheth us with, and from the perfect Pattern of moral Excellency which is ſet us by our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf in his own holy Life and Practices!

ſuperſtitious Extremes, worthy of a God of infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs to require, and becoming the true Dignity of the reaſonable Nature. It comprehendeth not only imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Acts of Devotion towards God, but a diligent Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of all relative Duties, and the faithful Diſcharge of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Offices incumbent upon us in the Civil and Social Life. It requireth us indeed to bear with a noble Fortitude the greateſt Evils, when we are regularly called to ſuffer for the Cauſe of God, but not raſhly to expoſe ourſelves to thoſe Evils or to bring them upon ourſelves.</p>
                        <p>The wiſe and beneficient Author of Nature hath ſtored the whole World about us with a Varietly of Benefits: and can it be thought to be agreeable to his Will, that inſtead of taſting his Goodneſs in the Bleſſings he vouchſafeth us, we ſhould make a Merit of never allowing ourſelves to enjoy them? How much more rational is it to receive thoſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings with Thankfulneſs, and enjoy them with Temparence, according to that of St. Paul, <hi>Every Creature of God is Good, and Nothing to be refuſed, if it be received with Thankſgiving: For it is ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer.</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 4, 5.

Is it reaſonable to imagine, that under the mild Diſpenſation of the Goſpel; which breaths an engenuous and chearful Spirit, and raiſeth us to the noble Liberty of the Children of God, the beſt Way of recommending ourſelves to his Favour ſhould be to deny ourſelves all the Comforts he affordeth us, and to paſs our Lives in perpetual Sadneſs and Abſtinence? Could it be ſaid in that Caſe, that <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all Things, having the Promiſe of the Life that now is, and of that which is to come?</hi> 1 Tim. iv. 8.—It was not indeed till Chriſtians began to degenerate from that love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Form of rational, ſolid Piety and Virtue, or which Chriſt himſelf exhibited the moſt perfect Example, that they laid ſo mighty a Streſs on thoſe ſevere and rigorous Auſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which neither our Saviour nor his Apoſtles had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. And in this Reſpect ſome of thoſe, who were an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiently

                     <p>But this is alſo a raſh Concluſion; ſince there is no ſufficient Reaſon to think that Love may not be counterfeited as well as other Graces. A Man may greatly love another, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wrong Notion or Idea of him, and yet if he were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived and really knew what Sort of a Man he was, his Love would immediately vaniſh 'Tis not Love to God and Chriſt under any Notion that Men may form in their Minds, that will evidence they have ſincere, genuine Love to the true God and his only begotten Son, and prove they are under the Influence of the Good Spirit. When prophane Sinners think (as they generally do) that God is altogether ſuch a one as themſelves, it is natural for them to love him under this Notion.

In Convictions a Man does not prepare himſelf for the Grace of God; but the Spirit of God prepares his own Way, treating the Sinner like a rational Creature, that ſo he may be willing to forſake his Sins, renounce his own Righteouſneſs, and receive and reſt upon Chriſt alone for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. 'Tis the Scripture Doctrine, that <hi>the Spirit convinces of Sin, and of Righteouſneſs; that by the Law is the Knowledge of Sin; that Sinners are alive in their own Conceits, 'till the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſet home on their Conſciences.</hi>

And indeed if the Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian Notion of Faith, viz. a Believing that Chriſt died for me in particular were true, legal Convictions would be the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Obſtacle to it. So that in this the Moravians are by far more conſiſtent with themſelves than other Antinomians. The leſs Senſe a Sinner has of his own Unworthineſs, and the more he values his own Excellency; the more eaſily he can believe, that God has a ſingular Regard for him, and that Chriſt muſt have a peculiar Eſteem for him, and if he died for any Body, beſure for him.</p>

Let us now attend a little to the Method in which the Spirit of God teaches Men in his Word.—As there are only general Truths in the Scripture, the Spirit of God enlightens Men's Minds only in general Truths. The Scriptures give us an Account of God, his glorious Perfections and Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. They repreſent his Law to be moſt excellent and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, to be holy, juſt and good. They deſcribe Sin againſt God to be moſt vile and abominable, and conſequently
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:009120_0041_1030F5B2784F63D8"/>
that Sinners are vile and wretched Creatures. They aſſert there is no Door of Hope for Sinners but through Jeſus Chriſt, who being the only begotten Son of God, the Brightneſs of his Glory and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, by himſelf purged our Sins, or made Attonement for them on the Croſs; and that whoſoever believes in this glorious Redeemer ſhall not periſh but have everlaſting Life. Theſe are general Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Perſons and Things conſidered in themſelves.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Now when the Spirit of God inſtructs Sinners in the Scriptures, he gives them a real view or Senſe of theſe Things, according to that <hi>conſiſtent</hi> Scheme which is in the Scriptures. He does not repreſent one Scripture contrary to another. He brings them to have the ſame Notions of theſe important Things, as he has delivered in his Word. They ſee by his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences that the Deſcriptions, which God has given in the Scriptures, are divinely true. When therefore a Sinner has the ſame Apprehenſions about God, his Law, his own Vile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the only Way of Salvation by Chriſt, as are delivered in the Scriptures; then he is taught by the Spirit—Such a Man apprehends God to be infinitely excellent and glorious, his Law to moſt pure and holy, worthy of God to reveal; himſelf to be unſpeakeably vile, ungrateful and abominable; yea juſtly liable to God's dreadful Wrath for violating this excellent Law; and that if he were to be condemned to the everlaſting Torments of Hell, it is no more than he juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves for diſhonoring a glorious God. He ſees that all the Declarations of God are infallibly true. He believes that Teſtimony which he has borne concerning Jeſus Chriſt. He ſees that this glorious Redeemer has laid a ſufficient Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the Safety of all believing Sinners, that God can be juſt and yet the Juſtifier of every one that believeth in Jeſus; and that whoſoever cometh unto Chriſt, he will in no wiſe caſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let him be ever ſo great a Sinner. Thus the Spirit of God teaches Sinners with his Word, bringing them effectually to know and love the Truths which are revealed in the Scriptures, the general Truths of God's holy Word, leading them to have ſuch Views of Things conſidered in themſelves, as are given in the Scriptures. If therefore a Man be conſcious to himſelf, that he apprehends divine Things as they are repreſented in the Scriptures; if he feels himſelf duly influenced by the Goſpel,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:009120_0042_1030F5B60D74EA70"/>
that the Life which he now lives in the Fleſh, he lives by Faith in the Son of God; then it is evident that he is led by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God. For <q>the Goſpel is to them that periſh Fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs.</q> They never behold its eminent Glory, they are never duly influenced by it. It is only to thoſe who are ſaved, that the Goſpel is made the Power of God.</p>
                     <p>As the Spirit of God teaches Men only general Truths from his Word, he does no more by the Sacraments. There is, I apprehend, an intire Correſpondence between the Declarations of the Word of God and the Sacraments. Seals are uſed among Men to confirm Writings, Bonds, Obligations, &amp;c. Thus, King Ahaſuerus confirmed his Commands, which he ſent to the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Provinces of his large Empire, not only "by writing them in his own Name," but "by ſealing them with his Ring." <note n="x" place="bottom">E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>her iii. 12.</note> Now though God's Declarations are worthy of all Acceptation, being ſufficiently credible in themſelves, becauſe of his infallible Truth and Faithfulneſs, yet guilty Sinners have many Fears, and are very prone to diſtruſt his gracious Promiſes; ſo that there is Need of various Sorts of Evidence to induce them to believe, or give hearty Credit to his Goſpel. Hence, God has been pleaſed in Condeſcention to our Weakneſs to affix Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper, by Way of Seals to his Goſpel or new Covenant. Now it is well known that among Mankind the Seal is affixed to the written Agreement, Bond, Indenture, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and to that only. Nothing is confirmed by the Seal, but what is expreſſed in the written Inſtrument to which it is affixed. And thus God confirms Nothing by the Sacraments, which are the Seals of the New-Teſtament or Covenant, but what he hath written in it. Is it not abſurd to imagine that there can be any Thing ſealed or confirmed by the Sacraments, but what is declared in that Covenant and written Word in the Bible to which they are affixed as Seals?</p>
                     <p>"This Cup, <hi>ſays Chriſt,</hi> is the New Teſtament in my Blood;" <hi>That is,</hi> as commonly explained, the Sacramental-Cup, which repreſents the Blood of Chriſt, is the Seal of the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or Covenant, which is eſtabliſhed by the Blood of Chriſt. God has expreſsly declared, that whoſoever believeth in Chriſt ſhall be ſaved. This is in brief the New-Covenant. God not only reveals this general Truth in Words, but he ſets his Seal
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:009120_0042_1030F5B60D74EA70"/>
to it in the Sacraments; hereby ſolemnly promiſing he will ſave them if they believe in the Senſe of the Goſpel. But he does by no Means ſeal to thoſe that partake of the Sacraments, that they have this Faith. For then he would ſeal ſomething that is not in the Scriptures, and very frequently ſeal what is not true in itſelf, ſince many, who partake of the Sacraments, have not juſtifying Faith.</p>
                     <p>Men on their Parts promiſe to fulfil this New Covenant, or believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. This is their Indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Duty, agreeable to the general Commands of Chriſt to all to repent and believe the Goſpel. So that there is no ſuch Thing, even when graceleſs Men partake of the Sacraments, as a Seal's being put to a Blank. Is it not true that God will ſave the Receivers if they truly believe? Is it not equally true, that it is the Duty of the Receivers to believe in Chriſt?</p>
                     <p>The Sacraments don't ſeal Men's ſaving Intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace. They are greatly miſtaken who imagine they do, and have yet to learn the proper Notion of Sacraments. Like Circumciſion of old, they are a Seal of the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Faith, a Confirmation that God will ſave all who have true Faith. Now it is every one's indiſpenſible Duty to believe. God required and commanded, yea he bound the Infants of the Jews to this by Circumciſion of Old. And why may he not bind and oblige Children of Chriſtian Parents under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to Faith in Chriſt? Why ſhould any deſire to have their Children free from theſe Obligations to believe in Chriſt? Are they tired with the Yoke of Chriſt themſelves, that they would have a greater Liberty reſerved for their Children to diſregard him? Why then are they ſo loth to dedicate them to him in Baptiſm?</p>
                     <p n="1">i. As it appears to be the Office of the Holy Spirit to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten Men's Minds in the general Truths revealed in the Scriptures, ſo on the contrary it appears to be one great Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Satan, by which, it is to be feared, he deceives many to deal in particular Suggeſtions, I mean, impreſſing particular Texts on their Minds as if ſuch Texts had an immediate ſpecial Referrence to them. Thus, you ſee he did in the Caſe of John Lewis; and there is Reaſon to believe he does ſo in many other Inſtances, where the Deluſion wears a more agreeable Dreſs. Satan inſtead of ſhewing a Sinner, who is under ſome Terrors, the general Encouragement there is in
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:009120_0043_1030F5B79E3B6910"/>
the Goſpel for all believing Sinners, let their Sins be ever ſo great, ſuddenly ſuggeſts to him ſome ſuch Thing as this, that <hi>he is elected, beloved, juſtified, that all his Sins are pardoned.</hi> For this Purpoſe he frequently improves ſuch Words as theſe <q>O Man greatly beloved—I have loved thee with an everlaſting Love—Son be of good Cheer thy Sins are forgiven thee— Fear not little Flock it is your Father's good Pleaſure to give you the Kingdom,</q> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Now ſuch Texts as they refer to us, teach us, as has been before obſerved, only general Truths, viz. <q>that God greatly loves his Saints, that he pardons their Sins, and will receive them into his heavenly Kingdom.</q> But they ſay Nothing of you, John, Thomas, Ann, Mary, by Name whither you are Saints or Sinners, beloved or hated. The holy Spirit when he enlightens your Minds in theſe Scriptures can never teach you, that you in particular are beloved, &amp;c. becauſe there is no ſuch Truth in them.</p>
                     <p>When therefore Perſons have it ſtrongly impreſſed on their Minds from theſe and the like Scriptures, that they in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar are beloved, elected, pardoned, juſtified; this is entirely a new Revelation, which muſt owe its Origin to an over heared Fancy or the Deluſion of Satan. Perſons muſt firſt believe in Chriſt, before they can have any rational Grounds to hope they were elected. They muſt prove their Election, and Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, by their effectual Calling and Sanctification. Men are ſaid to be juſtified by Faith in Chriſt. Conſequently they are not juſtified before they believe in this glorious Saviour. When therefore Perſons have it firſt revealed to them that their Sins are pardoned, and they juſtified; this is a Revelation of a Falſhood, and may therefore be juſtly aſcribed to Satan who is the Father of Lies.</p>
                     <p>Hence, it has been obſerved of ſuch Converts, that their Minds are not enlightened in the general Truths of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and the Way of Salvation by Chriſt by their Diſcoveries. The grand Thing they can tell is, that they are beloved, elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, juſtified, pardoned; and their Burthen has gone off, and they have been filled with Comfort and Joy, while they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the Lord manifeſted his peculiar Affection for them.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. When the Force of ſuch particular Impreſſions wear off in ſome conſiderable Meaſure, they would begin to be a little
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:009120_0043_1030F5B79E3B6910"/>
fearful: But to prevent all Convictions, Satan inſtils it into their Minds, that it is a great Sin to <hi>doubt,</hi> and perhaps ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſſes that Text, O thou of little Faith wherefore "didſt thou doubt? Thus, they are brought to imagine that true Faith in Chriſt is to believe firmly they are in a ſafe State, and that God has a ſingular Regard for them; and that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Faith is to maintan without any Evidence a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of themſelves.</p>
                     <p>This has been and ſtill is a very common Notion among many Perſons in the Chriſtian World. I muſt therefore examine it a little particularly.</p>
                     <p>It might be of Service, if Men would conſider what is meant in Scrripture by the Word <hi>Doubt,</hi> and to what it is applied in the ſacred Writings. They might ſee that <hi>Doubting</hi> in the Scriptures does not ſignify Men's queſtioning whether they are in a State of Grace, but whether Jeſus of Nazareth was the true Meſſias; or diſtruſting his Power, Truth and Faithfulneſs. <q>O thou of little Faith, wherefore didſt thou <hi>doubt, queſtion, ſcruple</hi> my Power to preſerve thee from drowning?</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It ſhould be remembered that the main Queſtion which was diſputed in the Time of Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, was whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jeſus of Nazareth was the promiſed Saviour. Men were termed Belivers or Unbelievers as they openly profeſſed or deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this fundamental Truth of Chriſtianity. The believing Samaritans declared thus, <note n="y" place="bottom">John iv. 42. Acts ix 22 John xx. 31. Acts viii 37.</note> 
                        <q>We have heard him ourſelves, and know that this is Indeed the Chriſt, the Saviour of the World.</q> The great Thing which Paul proved with ſuch ſtriking Evidence was, "that Jeſus is the very Chriſt." The Goſpel was written for this End, that <q>Men might believe that Jeſus is the Chriſt, and that believing they might have Life thro' his Name." The Profeſſion of the Eunuch was, I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God,</q> or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſias.</p>
                     <p>Hence, when Men ſcrupled, did not believe this Truth, they were ſaid to <hi>doubt.</hi> Thus the Jews, <note n="z" place="bottom">John x. 24. Mat. xxviii. 17.</note> 
                        <q>How long doſt thou make us to <hi>doubt?</hi> It thou be the Chriſt tell us plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly." Thus alſo after his Reſurrection, "When they ſaw him they Worſhiped him, but ſome doubted,</q> (or though
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:009120_0044_1030F5B92AF27608"/>
ſome had doubted) called in Queſtion the Truth of his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</p>
                     <p>Your Miſunderſtanding of the Word <hi>Doubt,</hi> as uſed in the Scriptures, has probably been an Occaſion of your falling into ſundry Miſtakes. While you have fancied the Eſſence of ſaving Faith conſiſts in being ſtrongly confident that God loves you, and that Chriſt died for you in particular, you are ready to pronounce all who have ſome Comfort after Convictions to be true Converts. You imagine that if they tell you their Experiences and you have Fellowſhip with them, you have a certain infallible Knowledge of their gracious State. Hence, the chief Part of your Converſation about Religion is employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in telling your religious Experiences. And I ſuppoſe it is from the ſame Notion, that you exact an Account of Men's religious Experiences before you receive them into your pretended Churches.</p>
                     <p>The ſtanding Miniſtry in general zealouſly maintain the great Importance and abſolute Neceſſity of experimental Religion, as our Sermons, and printed Diſcourſes and Books abundantly teſtify. For my own Part, were it not for that Regard which I have for experimental Religion, I ſhould not have taken ſo much Pains in my preſent low State of Health to reſcue it from your Miſrepreſentations, and to warn the World againſt thoſe Things in your Conduct, which are giving it ſuch a dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Blow.</p>
                     <p>Your prenouncing all, who pretend to have Comfort and Joy after Fears and Trrors, to be true Converts is raſh and unwarrantable; and muſt have a pernicious Tendency where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver your Influence reaches.</p>
                     <p>How many, who have been enlightened, in ſome Meaſure, and, like the ſtony-ground Hearers in the Parable of the Sower, receive the Word with Joy, ſoon loſe all remarkable Senſe of Religion, and prove themſelves by their wicked Practices to be in the Gall of Bitterneſs and in the Bonds of Iniquity? Now does it not reflect a Reproach on experimental Religion in the World, when one and another, who made high Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to it, and were cried up for eminent Chriſtians, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover they have no ſerious Regard for Religion at all?</p>
                     <p>Since it is certain, that there are common as well as ſaving Operations of the Spirit; that unſound Profeſſors may have
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:009120_0044_1030F5B92AF27608"/>
various Changes and Reformations; that many who ſeem to begin in the Spirit end in the Fleſh, <q>turning with the Dog to his Vomit and with the Sow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the Mire;</q> ſhould there not be the utmoſt Prudence and Caution uſed in declaring that others by Name are ſincere Converts? What Neceſſity lies upon Chriſtians to ſearch the Hearts of others, and make any Declaration at all, that they are in a gracious State? The Apoſtles received thouſands into the Church in a Day upon their profeſſing that Jeſus was the Chriſt, and treated <q>all <note n="a" place="bottom">1 Cor i 2</note> in every Place who called upon the Name of Jeſus Chriſt our Lord as viſible Saints,</q> though they knew there were many among them who had only the outward Badge of Chriſtianity. It is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent the Apoſtles did not examine thoſe whom they admitted into the Chriſtian Church, about their religious Experiences. For it is too abſurd to believe that they could particularly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine three Thouſand in a Day. Now if they did not examine them on this Point, but received them on their open Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, how come you to require a particular Relation of Religious Experiences before you will receive any Perſon into Communion with you? Where have you any Precept or Example in the Bible for exacting a Relation of Religious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, in Order to your admitting them to chriſtian Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges? Did Philip require the Eunuch to relate his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences before he baptiſed him? Or did he not adminiſter this Ordinance to him upon his profeſſing honeſtly to believe that Jeſus Chriſt was the Son of God? This is the Account the Scripture gives and farther ſaith not. Now remember it is written <q>Add thou not to his Words, leſt he reprove thee, and thou be found a Liar.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>You have been often told (and if I remember right by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident Edwards among others) that a Declaration of religious Experiences was never inſiſted on according to the Scriptures as a Term of Chriſtian Communion, nor any Inſtance of ſuch a Practice to be found from the Days of Adam to the Death of the Apoſtle John. Why don't you leave off this Practice or produce Scripture to defend it? <note n="b" place="bottom">As there is no Controverſy in New-England about exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining Candidates concerning their religious Experiences, I have no Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

It is but reaſonable you ſhould be conſiſtent with yourſelves. Therefore I deſire you, to produce the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the expreſs Command or Example, where Perſons were required to declare their ſecret religious Experiences in order to their being admitted to Baptiſm.</p>
                     <p>As to that Fellowſhip and Communion (as you underſtand the Words) which you profeſs to judge by, when you hear Perſons relate their religious Experiences, it is Nothing but a Sympathy or fellow-feeling with them, ſo far as their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences appear to you to agree with your own. And in this Senſe almoſt every Perſon feels ſomething like it in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Affairs of Life. Thus, when a true Engliſhman hears how his brave Countrymen have beaten the French, the perfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Enemies of Great-Britain, he is immediately intereſted in the Story and has a fellow-feeling with the Engliſh Generals and Soldiers in all their Dangers and Victories. And on the contrary a Frenchman ſympathiſes with his Countrymen. And Men who have ſtrong Connexions, whither from Intereſt, Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions or Principles, will have this ſympathetic Feeling, which you call Fellowſhip and Witneſſing for one another.</p>
                     <p>When you hear a Man tell his religious Experiences, and there happens to be ſome Similitude between yours and his, you will have a fellow-feeling with him; and upon a mutual Relation of Experiences, you may confirm one another's Hopes and grow more confident of your good Eſtates, and imagine you are greatly quickened and enlivened by ſuch an Interview. And thus if two perſons, who had an implacable Grudge at a third Perſon, ſhould open their Minds to one another, they would have a great Deal of fellow-feeling with one another, and would be more encouraged and confirmed in their Enmity againſt him. But can you think that this is what the Scriptures call the Communion of Saints?</p>
                     <p>To rectify your Miſtakes about the Meaning of the Words Communion and Fellowſhip of Saints as uſed in Scripture, you may obſerve, that when a Number of Perſons have a common Intereſt in any Thing, which is capable of being divided into Parts they have Communion or Fellowſhip in that Thing, each
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:009120_0045_1030F5BC720EED18"/>
one receiving his proper Share. Hence the Apoſtle ſpeaking of the Lord's Supper ſays, <q>The Cup of Bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the Communion of the Blood of Chriſt? The Bread which we break is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt? Becauſe the Bread is one <note n="c" place="bottom">So it ſhould be Tranſlated. See the Original and Conſult Beza and Whitby on this Text. 1 Cor. x. 16, 17.</note> we many are one Body; for we are all Partakers of that one Bread.</q> Thus Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans according to the Apoſtle ſharing or partaking in the ſame Elements of Bread and Wine have Communion or Fellowſhip together.</p>
                     <p>But where the Subject mentioned is not capable of being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, Men have Communion together in Reſpect of ſaid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, who each of them have the whole. Saints have all of them, one as well as another, the ſame God, the ſame Chriſt, the ſame Holy Ghoſt, the ſame Graces. And thus all Saints have Communion with one another, however diſtant they may live as to Time or Place. The Word Communion or Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Saints among themſelves is uſed ordinarily in one or the other of theſe two Senſes, in the Scriptures. Thus, it appears that the Communion and Fellowſhip of the Saints mentioned in the Scriptures is quite a different Thing from your ſympathetic-feeling, ariſing from Communication of Experiences. Which Fellowſhip you can have only with thoſe who tell you their Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: Whereas all Saints have Communion with one another though they live in different Countries and Ages of the World.</p>
                     <p>What has been ſaid about the Nature of your fellow-feeling with one another in your mutual relating your Experiences, clearly diſcovers what Sort of Evidence that is, which you call witneſſing for one another's Converſion. When you have this Fellowſhip, this is an Evidence that you have, or pretend to have ſome religious Experiences; and that there is ſome Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milarity or Likeneſs between your Experiences. But it is no certain Proof, that the Man has had thoſe Experiences, which he relates. For he may borrow them, for any Thing you can tell, from ſome Book that gives an Account of the Life and Experiences of ſome excellent Chriſtian publiſhed from his Diary by his Friends after his Death. You can remember ſome Inſtances in which you have been wretchedly impoſed

on, if you pleaſe. But ſuppoſe the Perſon relates his own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences, and you have ſtrong Sympathy with him, and he with you; this is no infallible Proof, that either of you have Grace. For may not two Hypocrites have Experiences very like one another? May not a large Number of Hypocrites be deceived by the ſame Spirit, and ſplit on the ſame Rock? And have Fellowſhip in one another's falſe Experiences?</p>
                     <p>When you determine Perſons to be in a gracious State <hi>merely</hi> by <hi>your Fellowſhip</hi> with them in their religious Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, does not this open a Door for proud Hypocrites to vaunt themſelves, that they may be accounted eminent Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians? And will not the meek, modeſt and humble Saint on your Scheme be in Danger of being deſpiſed and contemned? Falſe Profeſſors, like the Phariſees, are likely to be very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in proclaiming their own Goodneſs. They may have ſtrong Fellowſhip with one another from the Agreement of their Experiences. Now the Scriptures repreſent, that the greateſt Part even of Profeſſors are not true Converts. <q>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are called but few choſen.</q> Many travel the broad Way to Deſtruction, few find the narrow Way that leads to eternal Life. When therefore you receive or reject a Man by your Fellowſhip with him, requiring all your Members, Men, Women, Boys and Girls (as your Practice is) to witneſs for or againſt him, the greater Part of you muſt neceſſarily judge by a falſe Rule; ſince every reaſonable Man muſt allow, it is more than probable, that at leaſt more than half of your elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Body are unconverted, and of Conſequence have no right Experiences of their own.</p>
                     <p>There is a probability that Hypocrites will have Fellowſhip with Hypocrites from the ſameneſs of their Experiences. As they are not much reſtrained by Modeſty and Humility, but ambitious to be accounted eminent Chriſtians, their open Freedom and Forwardneſs will give them great Influence.

So that they run the Riſque of being received but very coldly, and ſometimes of being wholly excluded from your Churches, if you adhere ſtrictly to that Plan you have ſet up. Thus, your Scheme bids fair to open the Doors of your pretended. Churches for all ſelfdeceived, proud, forward Hypocrites; and to ſhut them againſt ſincere humble Chriſtians.</p>
                     <p>This Method of yours in ſetting up religious Experiences as the <hi>only Rule</hi> of judging by, ſeems to be liable to a very juſt and ſtrong Objection, in that it leads you off from the written Word of God to follow your own ſympathetic Feelings with them in their Relations. You don't pretend to know that ſuch and ſuch Perſons are converted, becauſe their Experiences, which they relate to you, are agreeable to the Account which the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures give of the Work of Grace in the Hearts of Saints, and the Inſtances of Converſion which are recorded in them; but you pronounce them converted becauſe you have a ſecret Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with them, or becauſe you have ſome ſtrong Impulſe or private Revelation that they are born again. Thus you don't uſe the Scriptures as any Rule in forming your Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment about your Converts. No Wonder you paſs many a raſh Judgment. Muſt you not be ſtrangely bewildered who after all can ſtill confidently blunder on in ſuch groſs Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities!</p>
                     <p>Religious Converſation or Diſcourſe is doubtleſs very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, and ſhould be promoted and practiſed by Chriſtians. But I muſt be excuſed at preſent from thinking, that a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual relating of Men's ſecret Experiences is much for Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. Does it not look too much like Oſtentation? Would it not be much better, when you diſcourſe about experimental Religion, to enquire, not what you or I have experienced as the Marks of a ſincere Chriſtian; but what God has revealed in his Word about this important Matter. Do Chriſtians know Nothing about God, his holy Law, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and his Redemption, &amp;c. &amp;c. that they can't furniſh out a Converſation on religious Subjects, without always introducing their own Experiences and Feelings? <q>Surely, <hi>ſays Mr. Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamy,</hi> thoſe cannot be ſaid to <hi>remember God</hi> who are always full of <hi>themſelves,</hi> full of a Senſe of their own Goodneſs, and are dwelling forever upon their own high Attainments, ready al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to ſay, God I thank thee I am not as other Men!

But it is natural for ſome always to make <hi>I</hi> the Burden of their Story: However, you ſee this is not commended by ſome who ſuſtain a religious Character. And why ſhould you deſire to diſcourſe about Religion in that Way which expoſes your own Characters, and gives Offence to many religious Perſons. Should you not beware of giving Offence?</p>
                     <p>Your Method of talking religious Experiences, and judging by them, furniſhes ſome, as they think, with a ſpecious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to ſearch and try thoſe they don't love; as alſo to cenſure and condemn thoſe who don't incline to ſubmit to their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination. Some ſuch are known to ride up and down the Country, requiring Perſons, eſpecially Miniſters, to give them an Account of their religious Experiences. Some Time ago a Fellow, who was an utter Stranger to me, called at my Houſe, and immediately addreſſed me thus. <q>As I underſtand you are the Miniſter of this Pariſh I want to aſk you one or two Queſtions.</q> I told him he might aſk as many reaſonable Queſtions as he pleaſed. Then he proceeded without further Ceremony. <q>Do you look upon yourſelf to be in a Sate of Grace? What are your religious Experiences?</q> I anſwered him; his Queſtions appeared to me very improper, both as he was an intire Stranger whom I had never ſeen nor heard of before, and as he was not inveſted with any proper Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that I knew of, to make ſuch Enquiries, and therefore I ſhould not anſwer them. Upon this he went off ſaying he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved I had no Grace. This extraordinary Viſit led me to enquire what Sort of a Man he was, from which I ſoon found he was a Man of a very had moral Character.</p>
                     <p>Such Sort of Treatment and Enquiries excited me to ſearch the Scriptures, whether there was any Foundation in them for ſuch Practices. But upon the moſt diligent Search, I have
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:009120_0047_1030F5C489352D80"/>
not diſcovered any Paſſage, that warrants Chriſtians thus to demand an Account of other's religious Experiences. The Paſſages that have been chiefly inſiſted on as Proofs for ſuch a Practice, I think, are two. The firſt is the Words of the Pſalmiſt, <note n="f" place="bottom">Pſalm lxvi. 16.</note> 
                        <q>Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul.</q> Your Unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintedneſs with Languages may incline you to be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that this Text favours your Notions. But I apprehend there is no certain Evidence, that the Pſalmiſt had any Refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his religious Experiences in theſe Words. According to the Idiom of the Hebrew Language, the Word, which our Tranſlators have rendered <hi>Soul,</hi> very often ſignifies the Perſon himſelf. <note n="g" place="bottom">Exod. i. 5. Pſalm iii. 2. Pſalm cxliii 12.</note> Thus all the Souls that came out of the Loins of Jacob were ſeventy Souls, <hi>that is,</hi> ſeventy Perſons. So the Pſalmiſt himſelf, <q>Many there be which ſay of <hi>my Soul</hi> i e. of me, there is no Help for him in God.</q> 
                        <q>Deſtroy all them that afflict <hi>my Soul</hi> i. e. me, for I am thy Servant.</q> Hence, perhaps the Words under Conſideration might have been as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly tranſlated, <hi>I will declare what he hath done for me,</hi> and the Clauſe referred to the temporal Deliverances, which he celebrates in this Pſalm; at leaſt there is no Certainty that this is not the Senſe of the Paſſage.</p>
                     <p>But if it were certain, that the Pſalmiſt in theſe Words had a Referrence to religious Experiences, the Text would even then be far enough from countenancing your Practice. For he does not require others to relate their ſecret Experiences to him, but profeſſes his Readineſs to declare to ſuch as were looked on as Fearers of the Lord, the Experiences he had on that remarkable Occaſion. He did not give this Account of his Experiences to ſatisfy any Body about his gracious State, to give them any Light about his being a true Saint. For he was a Saint and treated as ſuch long before he wrote this Pſalm. So that all that can be inferred from the Text taken in this Senſe, is, that a Chriſtian may relate his Experiences, when he has Reaſon to think it will be for Edification, which muſt be left to his own diſcretion, conducted agreeable to the general Rules of the Word. There is nothing in this Text to warrant your requiring and demanding Perſons to relate
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:009120_0048_1030F5C7C9D161C8"/>
their Experiences to you, on Pain of being cenſured and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as graceleſs Wretches and Hypocrites.</p>
                     <p>It may be of great Advantage and Service to the Church of Chriſt, for Chriſtians to relate their religious Experiences on proper Occaſions. The Lives of excellent Chriſtians that are written with Judgment are of great Service and contain much uſeful Inſtruction. And to relate Experiences on ſome very important Occaſions may in ſome Meaſure anſwer the ſame End. When Perſons labour under great Troubles, Difficulties, Darkneſs, Temptations, &amp;c. it might often be of great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to them to open their Minds freely to their Miniſter, or to ſome judicious Chriſtian in whoſe Prudence and Secrecy they could confide. But to have religious Troubles and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences blazed abroad, and toſſed about on the Tongues of the careleſs World muſt, I think, have no good Tendency. Such open Proclamation of Experiences puffs up ignorant and proud Profeſſors. It fixes the Eyes and Attention of the World on them to keep a narrow Watch, to wait for their Halting; ſo that when they fall into any Miſcarriages this proves a Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Block, and thus Experimental Religion is brought into Contempt. <q>Such a one, <hi>ſay they,</hi> was converted to'ther Month or Year, ſee how he behaves now, we always tho't Pretenſions to Converſion and Grace were Nothing, but mere Cant and Hypocriſy.</q> Now can you think ſuch Things are likely to promote Religion?</p>
                     <p>The other Text which you produce for your Practice is the Direction of the Apoſtle Peter— <q>And <hi>be</hi> ready always to <hi>give</hi> an Anſwer to every Man that aſketh you a Reaſon of the Hope that is in you, with Meekneſs and Fear.</q> In this Paſſage of his Epiſtle, whereof theſe words are a Part, the Apoſtle is giving the Chriſtians to whom be wrote Directions for their Deportment in the World, the Sum of which is, that they cultivate a peaceful, benevolent Temper and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. He recommends this as an excellent Preſervative from Reproaches, Sufferings and Perſecutions. However he hints, that let them be ever ſo prudent and peaceable, it might ſo happen, they ſhould meet with various Troubles and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons from the Enemies of the Chriſtian Religion; and he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts them with this. <q>If ye ſuffer for Righteouſneſs Sake, happy <hi>are ye;</hi> and be not afraid of their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>You ſee the Apoſtle ſpeaks of two Sorts of Men in this Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, profeſſed Chriſtians and their open Enemies, that accuſed and perſecuted them. He gives the Chriſtians a Direction in theſe Words for their Conduct towards their open Enemies, whither profeſſed Jews or Heathens. Now can any ſober un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced Perſons think, the Apoſtle could direct Chriſtians to tell their ſecret religious Experiences to the profeſſed Unbelievers, who falſely accuſed and perſecuted them? Would it not be ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abſurd for a ſerious Chriſtian now a Days to relate his religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Experiences to a reproaching Deiſt or Indian?</p>
                     <p>As Jeſus of Nazareth was proved to be the true Meſſias and Saviour of the World, by the moſt glorious Evidence of Miracles; and by fulfilling the Propheſies of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, &amp;c. it was a moſt reaſonable Thing, that all, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to believe in him, ſhould be always ready to ſhew the Reaſons why they believed, hoped and truſted in him. If any of their Enemies ſhould aſk them a Reaſon or Diſcourſe of the Hope that was in them, deſiring them to ſhew why they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that Jeſus of Nazareth was the Chriſt; Nothing could be more reaſonable than to ſet before them the Evidences of the Chriſtian Religion. Thus Paul ſpeaks of his being <note n="h" place="bottom">Acts xxiii. 6.</note> 
                        <q>called in Queſtion of the Hope and Reſurrection of the Dead.</q> He was ready to ſhew the Reaſons of his embracing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity. And all, who call themſelves by the Name of Chriſt, ſhould be ſo well acquainted with the Doctrines and Evidences of our holy Religion, as to be ready to ſhew every one that aſks them in a ſober Manner, ſome ſufficient Reaſons, why they believe Jeſus of Nazareth to be the Chriſt, and hope and truſt in him. For I preſume the Text has not changed its Senſe by Length of Time. The Direction is ſtill Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant.</p>
                     <p>'Tis certain that the Apoſtles had the higheſt Regard for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental

Religion. They well knew that unleſs Men have right Experiences, they can't have true Religion. Yet they were not forward in relating their own extraordinary Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences. They obſerve the greateſt Modeſty and Decorum, when they were obliged to ſay any Thing about themſelves. But the falſe Teachers, who oppoſed the Apoſtles, were very forward in recommending themſelves, and boaſting of their great Attainments. In Oppoſition to theſe Deceivers, St. Paul found it neceſſary to ſay ſomething about himſelf, his Labours, Sufferings, Viſions and Revelations; yet he does it in ſuch a Manner, (as Dr. Doddridge juſtly obſerves) as plainly ſhews how diſagreeable it was to him, ſo much as ſeem to applaud himſelf on the moſt neceſſary Occaſions Moſt remarkable is the Apology <note n="i" place="bottom">2 Cor. xi. 12.</note> of the Apoſtle, <q>I ſay—Let no Man, think me a Fool; if otherwiſe yet as a Fool receive me, that I may boaſt myſelf a little. That which I ſpeak, I ſpeak <hi>it</hi> not after the Lord, but as it were fooliſhly in this Confidence of Boaſting. Seeing that many glory after the Fleſh, I will glory alſo, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q> —It is not expedient for me doubtleſs to glory, I will come to Viſions and Revelations of the Lord.—I am become a Fool in glorying, ye have compelled me. Thus he ſhews it was with the greateſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance that he ſaid any Thing about his own Experiences. How widely different was the Temper and Conduct of the Apoſtles, from that which prevails among you who are always harping on your own great Experiences!</p>
                     <p>Tho' there can be no ſincere chriſtian Piety without experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Acquaintance with God through Jeſus Chriſt by the Spirit, yet a Relation of religious Experiences is not made the grand Evidence of the Sincerity of Men's Profeſſion, in the Scriptures. When Chriſt recommends it to his Diſciples to prove their Holineſs to the World, he does not direct them to convince them by telling their ſecret Experiences, and ſweet Communion which they had with God; but, <q>Let <note n="k" place="bottom">Matt. v. 16.</note> your Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee your good Works and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</q> Hence, <note n="l" place="bottom">James ii 18.</note> that of the Apoſtle James, <q>I will ſhew thee my Faith by my Works.</q> Others may do what they pleaſe,

and appoint what Marks they will of their having ſaving Faith, and being true Chriſtians; but as for me, I look upon good Works to be the beſt Evidence, <note n="m" place="bottom">See Preſident Edwards on Religious Affections laſt Part.</note> I will ſhew my Faith by my Works. <q>In this, <hi>ſays the Apoſtle John,</hi> the Children of God are manifeſt and the Children of the Devil.</q> How are they manifeſt? By the Relation of their religious Experiences to the World? No, by their good Works. For thus he proceeds and informs us, <q>Whoever doth not Righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother.— He that doth Righteouſneſs is righteous even as he is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous.</q>

                     <p>Where you have pronounced a Perſon to be converted from your Fellowſhip with his Experiences, your Credit as a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and as a pure Church that conſiſts only of gracious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, naturally leads you to warn him againſt examining and doubting his Converſion; ſo that though he ſhould not <hi>do</hi> Righteouſneſs, nor ſhew his Faith by his Works, nor bring forth good Fruits, yet he muſt not ſcruple his Juſtification. If by any Means he ſhould ſuſpect he was yet unconverted, then all your Art and Induſtry muſt be uſed to perſuade him, he is troubled with the Temptations of Satan, and that he muſt believe he is converted. Your Conduct in ſome Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this Kind is well known.</p>
                     <p>We read of Seducers of Old, who in a Caſe ſomething like this, cried <q>Peace, and there is no Peace; one built up a Wall and lo, others daubed it with untempered Mortar.

                     <p>'Tis indeed true, that the Apoſtles ſpeak of the Churches in their Time as conſiſting of Saints. This was a Name which was given to all Chriſtian Profeſſors. Chriſtians in the Apoſtle's Times profeſſed Chriſt, in Oppoſition to the whole World, in the Face of the greateſt Dangers, and ſevereſt Perſecutions.

There was a ſtrong Preſumption that many of them were ſincere Saints, eſpecially that the Influences of the Holy Spirit were poured out in a remarkable Manner. Beſides, all who profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus to be the Chriſt were immediately baptized, and thus publickly ſanctified or conſecrated to God, and inliſted among the Diſciples of his Son. They belonged to the viſible Church and Houſhold of Faith, and are called <hi>Brethren.</hi> And thus as the World before the Coming of Chriſt was divided into Jews and Gentiles, ſo under the New-Teſtament it is viſibly divided into profeſſing Chriſtians and open Unbelievers, thoſe that acknowledge Chriſt, and thoſe who deny him, as Jews, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and Deiſts. The Apoſtle comprehends the whole World under thoſe who were <hi>without</hi> and thoſe who were <hi>within</hi> the viſible Church. <note n="p" place="bottom">1 Cor. v. 12, 13.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Inferences you ſhould draw from this, is to treat all profeſſing Chriſtians as Saints in Proportion as they ſhew the Sincerity of their Faith by their good Works. But you are certainly extremely miſtaken, when you pretend to prove, from the Apoſtles addreſſing the Churches to whom they wrote by the Name of Saints, that they looked on them collectively to be real Saints.</p>
                     <p>They well remembered that Chriſt had taught them it was his Will, that when there are Tares in the ſame Field with the Wheat, the Servants ſhould not pull them up. They were alſo well acquainted with the Parable of the Sower, and the ſtony and thorny Ground Hearers. They ſpeak of <note n="q" place="bottom">2 Cor. xi. 26. Gal. ii. 4.</note> "falſe Brethren." It is ſuppoſed by Paul, <q>that a Man that was called a Brother might be a Fornicator, covetous, and an Idolater, a Railer, a Drunkard, an Extortioner.</q> 
                        <note n="r" place="bottom">1 Cor. v. 11.</note> While ſuch a Man concealed his Vices, and brought no public Scandal on the Church, he was not to be caſt out. But when he brought a public Reproach on the Church by his viſible ill Life, he was to be diſciplined; and if he refuſed to repent, and give chriſtian Satisfaction, he was to be excommunicated. But no Perſon was ever to be caſt out of the viſible Church, merely becauſe he had not ſaving Grace. The Crimes for which they were to be excommunicated were publick, ſuch as could be proved upon Oath by credible Perſons. <q>In the

Whereas, if he knew he was guilty of ſuch and ſuch public Crimes, he could bear Witneſs againſt him.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtles were not deceived by Perſons, who proved to be wicked, as Simon Magus, &amp;c. For it does not appear that they formed any Judgment about their being ſincerely gracious. They did not examine them about their religious Experiences, nor baptiſe them in Conſequence of having Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with them in ſuch Relations. If they had, they muſt have taken up a great Deal of Time in examining, judging and witneſſing for them who preſented themſelves. It would have taken them at leaſt two or three Months to have admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the three Thouſand on this Plan. But we know they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them in leſs than a Day.</p>
                     <p>If the Apoſtles had received none into the Church but ſuch as they had examined and approved as ſincere Saints, their own Credit and Characters would have ſuffered extremely, when any of them apoſtatiſed, as ſundry of them did. How could they have perſuaded ſober thinking Perſons, they were divinely inſpired, if they had been daily forming falſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about Perſons. They would perhaps have been temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, like you, to have perſuaded them, they were ſtill in a State of Grace. But inſtead of this we find they aſſured all Profeſſors, who did not bring forth the Fruits of Righteouſneſs and ſhew the Sincerity of their Faith by their Works, that they were as deſtitute of ſaving Grace as the Devils. The Apoſtle Paul ſpeaking of profeſſed Chriſtians ſays, <q>Many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you even weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they are the Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, whoſe End is Deſtruction, whoſe God is their Belly, and whoſe Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is in their Shame, who mind earthly Things.</q>

                     <p>As the Apoſtles received Perſons into the viſible Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their profeſſing to believe that Jeſus of Nazareth was the Chriſt, their Apoſtacy and Wickedneſs brought no Diſgrace on the Apoſtles. We never find their Enemies upbraiding
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:009120_0051_1030F5CC803BE7F0"/>
and reproaching them for being miſtaken in their Judgment about thoſe whom they received when they proved naughty. None were ſo ready to point out, and reprove hypocritical Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, as the Apoſtles themſelves. The Notion of a viſible Church that ſhall conſiſt only of ſincere Saints in this World never entred into their Heads. It is not the Deſign of Chriſt to erect ſuch a Church in this World. It is <note n="u" place="bottom">Matth. xiii. 37,—50.</note> not till the End of the World that <q>the Son of Man ſends forth his Angels, to gather out of his Kingdom all Things that offend, and them which do Iniquity.—The Kingdom of Heaven or <hi>the viſible Church in this World</hi> is like unto a Net that was caſt into the Sea, and gathered of every Kind; which when it was full they drew to Shore, and ſat down, gathered the good into Veſſels, but caſt the bad away.

                     <p>If ſome who are viſibly unholy and ſcandalous, did not take Shelter among you to eſcape Cenſures for their immoral Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, one would hope you were more honeſt in your Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſo much greater Purity. In all probability they would not be ſo fond of you, if you would faithfully remonſtrate againſt their ſcandalous Practices. But to proceed,</p>
                     <p>Since there was no Man received into the Goſpel Church without profeſſing and believing that Jeſus was the Chriſt, and ſince it is certain that many who thus believed were not
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:009120_0051_1030F5CC803BE7F0"/>
in a State of Salvation; it plainly follows that a mere Aſſent to this Truth, or even to the Goſpel is not ſaving Faith.</p>
                     <p>Different Men may believe the Goſpel from Different Cauſes and Motives. Some <hi>don't doubt</hi> of the Truth of it, becauſe their Parents told them ſo. Others aſſent to the Goſpel from much the ſame Inducements, as they believe any other Hiſtory. Men believe other ancient Hiſtories, ſuch as Caeſars Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries, Tacitus, Joſephus, &amp;c. at leaſt many Things in them, without ſeeing any ſpecial Glory or Beauty in them, though they are not the tenth Part ſo well atteſted as the Goſpel. Have not the Scriptures been abundantly confirmed by ſuch infallible Proofs, as muſt force the Aſſent of every rational Perſon who carefully examines them without Prejudice? What ſhould hinder Men from believing the Goſpel Hiſtory upon merely rational Evidences, without ſeeing that eminent Glory in it, which the Spirit of God diſcovers to true Saints at their Converſion? But though Men may truly aſſent to the Goſpel from ſundry Cauſes, yet the Spirit of God is beyond Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon the higheſt and moſt excellent Cauſe; and conſequently that Faith which he works in Men by his ſaving Operations, muſt be the moſt excellent. Hence, no Man can in this high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt important Senſe, believe and ſay that Jeſus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>Yet it is certain from the Goſpel Hiſtory, that many belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, who were Strangers to the ſaving Operations of the Spirit. <q>Many, <hi>ſays the Evangeliſt John,</hi> believed in his Name, when they ſaw the Miracles which he did. But Jeſus did not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelf unto them, becauſe he knew all Men.</q> The Stony-Ground Hearers are repreſented in the Parable as receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word with Joy, which implies at leaſt their aſſenting to it as true; otherwiſe they would not have been ſo much affected with it. What we don't believe does not move our Paſſions. Ananias and Sapphira were received into the Church upon this Belief: Simon Magus believed; yet they diſcovered by their not bringing forth the Fruits of Righteouſneſs, that they had not ſaving Faith, but were in the Gall of Bitterneſs and Bonds of Iniquity. <q>I know, <hi>ſaid Paul to Agrippa the almoſt Chriſtian,</hi> thou believeſt the Prophets.</q> And certainly, it was as difficult to believe the divine Teſtimony in the Prophets, as in the Goſpel.

                     <p>How abſurd then is Barclay, in ſaying, that <q>the ſpiritual Truths of the Goſpel are as Lies in the Mouths of carnel and unſpiritual Men?</q> Why did not Paul tell Agrippa ſo? Why did not James tell thoſe to whom he wrote that they only lied, when they profeſſed to believe?</p>
                     <p>Yet this Abſurdity is a darling Topick with many of you, on which you lay great Streſs. For proceeding upon this groſs Miſtake, you charge all who enter into Covenant in our Churches without certain and infallible Aſſurance of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, with Lying; and that Miniſters not only allow but urge their Hearers to lie to God. One, who hears you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on this Point, as I have often done, would be inclined to ſuſpect, you had never read and conſidered the xxix Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Deuteronomy, where God expreſsly commanded the whole Nation of the Iſraelites to enter into Covenant with him, that he might be to them a God, as he had ſworn unto their Fathers, Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob. Were the Iſraelites, who were commanded to enter thus into Covenant with God, all aſſured of their gracious State? If they imagined they were truly converted, they were under an awful Deluſion. For Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes plainly aſſured them, <q>the Lord had not given them an Heart to perceive, and Eyes to ſee, or Ears to hear unto this Day;</q> ſo that he looked on the general Part of them to be unconverted. Yet that very Day they were all to enter into Covenant with God in a viſible, explicit, ſolemn Manner, leſt any ſhould imagine they ſhould eſcape the terrible Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence denounced in the Law againſt thoſe that preſumed to tranſgreſs. If it had been unlawful for unconverted Perſons, to enter into viſible Covenant with God, why did not the Lord plainly tell the Iſraelites ſo? Why did he not command Moſes to warn them againſt this viſible Covenanting, ſince you reckon it a moſt dreadful Sin? If your Nations were right, is it not the moſt unaccountable and aſtoniſhing Thing, that ever was heard of, that he ſhould command them thus
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:009120_0052_1030F5CFC5623450"/>
publickly to enter into his Covenant? Will you ſpeak out plainly, and ſay, that he required them to Sin, or that he made Lying their indiſpenſable Duty?</p>

                     <p>Anſ. The xxix of Deuteronomy is expreſs and plain: For it was deſigned to be immediately underſtood and obeyed by the whole Nation, Men, Women and Children, and therefore it muſt have been level to the loweſt Capacities. This Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture may be reaſonably ſuppoſed to be one of the plaineſt in the whole Bible. Now it is a ſafe Rule, when two Scriptures treat of the ſame Thing, to explain that one, which is more ſhort and obſcure, by the other which is more full and plain. Since therefore it is certain from Moſes, that God expreſsly required and commanded all without Exception, to enter into Covenant with him, and that they underſtood and practiſed accordingly, the Pſalmiſt muſt be interpreted in ſuch a Senſe as is conſiſtent with this, unleſs you would ſuppoſe there are real Contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Scriptures, which would be the Way to undermine their Authority altogether. Hence, the Deſign of the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt in the Text you object, muſt be to reprove the Jews, not for entring into Covenant with God, which he had commanded them, but for breaking their ſacred Bonds by their wicked Lives, or perhaps the Pſalmiſt refers to open profane Sinners who were to be excommunicated.</p>
                     <p>We muſt put a ſimilar Conſtruction on ſundry Scriptures, ſuch as <note n="x" place="bottom">Iſaiah i. 12, 13.</note> 
                        <q>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your Hand to tread my Courts? Bring no more vain Oblations. Incenſe is an Abomination unto me, the New Moons and Sabbaths, the calling of Aſſemblies I cannot away with, <hi>it is</hi> Iniquity, even the ſolemn Meeting.</q> If you explain the Prophet Iſaiah as you do the Pſalmiſt, you muſt allow that wicked Men are forbidden to keep the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, and attend on publick Worſhip. The Expreſſions of the Prophet are as ſtrong as thoſe of the Pſalmiſt. Hence the Deſign of both, I think, is to reprove Men for their Wickedneſs after they had been attending on the Duties of Religion.</p>

                        <pb n="86" facs="unknown:009120_0053_1030F5D4B4C0BED8"/>2. You ſay, <q>Men ſhould ſincerely believe in Chriſt when they profeſſedly enter into Covenant with him.</q> And ſhould not Men keep the Sabbath in a gracious Manner? Should not Men when they pray in the Name of Chriſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely believe in him? Is it not expreſsly commanded that Men pray in Faith? And is not the Prayer of the Wicked an Abomination to the Lord? Would you infer from theſe Texts, that Men ſhould not pray 'till they know, they are converted and have true Faith? This is too abſurd.</p>

                        <pb n="87" facs="unknown:009120_0053_1030F5D4B4C0BED8"/>The firſt Juſtification according to them is the Infuſion of Communication unto us of an holy Principle, the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Grace or Charity, by which Original Sin is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and all the Habits of Sin expelled. This firſt Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification they ſay, is by Faith, <hi>that is,</hi> a mere Aſſent to the Truth of the Goſpel, the Obedience and Satisfaction of Chriſt being the only meritorious Cauſe thereof. So that to be juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified by Faith according to them is to have the Mind rightly prepared by this Kind of believing to receive an Habit of Grace expelling Sin and making us acceptable to God. For, upon this believing or aſſenting to the Goſpel, with thoſe other Duties of Contrition and Repentance, which muſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it, they ſay it is meet and congruous unto divine Wiſdom, Goodneſs and Faithfulneſs to give us that Grace, whereby we are finally juſtified. For their ſecond or final Juſtification is a Conſequence hereof, the proper formal Cauſe of which is good Works, proceeding from this Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Grace and Love. Hence Men's own good Works ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Papiſts, are <hi>the Righteouſneſs,</hi> wherewith Believers are righteous before God, whereby they merit Heaven.</p>
                     <p>But according to the Doctrine of all ſound Proteſtants, the Righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>that is,</hi> what he did and ſuffered, is <hi>that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>or which</hi> we are juſtified before God. This is the grand Difference between Papiſts, and Proteſtants. It is well known that it was chiefly on Account of Juſtification by Faith alone, the firſt Reformers ſeparated from the Church of Rome.</p>
                     <p>Antinomians and Enthuſiaſts would fain have it believed, that they are the moſt Orthodox in Point of Juſtification. And they ſeem at firſt View to run into the oppoſite Extreme to the Papiſts. But if they are cloſely examined, many of them, I believe would be found to have pretty much the ſame Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with the Papiſts on this grand Fundamental Doctrine of a Sinner's Juſtification before God. They commonly place Faith in a mere Aſſent of the Mind. Their Scheme of experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Religion neceſſarily requires this, ſince it is all ſuppoſed to proceed from God's revealing his Love to them in Particular. In this they eſſentially agree with the Papiſts, only that they don't ſeem to be quite ſo orthodox. For the Papiſts ſay, Faith is an Aſſent to the Truths of the Goſpel. But Enthuſiaſts
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:009120_0054_1030F5D7F44996F0"/>
place it in believing the Love of God, their own Election, Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, &amp;c. in particular; which, as has been already pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is Something which is not in the Bible at all in their Senſe, but depends on ſome fanciful Diſcovery or Deluſion. Let this then correſpond to the Faith and the firſt Juſtification of the Papiſts.</p>
                     <p>And whoever carefully obſerves your Temper and Spirit, the mighty Streſs, you appear to lay on your Performances, on your great Zeal and Engagedneſs in Religion, and the Pains you ſeem to take to work up yourſelves to Raptures and Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, will ſee there is Reaſon to fear that you look upon theſe Things as that Righteouſneſs by which you expect to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend yourſelves to God, and for which you hope you ſhall be juſtified in his Sight. For my Part, I earneſtly wiſh that you may not be found among thoſe who go about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs. Does not Barclay, the famous Quaker Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſt, confound Juſtification with Sanctification, and profeſſedly plead <q>That it is by the inward Birth of Chriſt in Man that he is made juſt, and therefore ſo accounted by God?</q> And are not his Followers as ignorant as he, of the Scripture Doctrine of Juſtification?</p>
                     <p>To prove that I have laid no unjuſt Charge againſt you who have ſeparated from the ſtanding Churches of New-England, in what I have now alledged, I might bring many Teſtimonies from ſundry worthy Perſons: But I ſhall content myſelf at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the united Teſtimony of Mr. Preſident Edwards and Mr. Bellamy in a Book written by the latter and recommended by the former. The Author having repreſented that true Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility conſiſts in a Senſe of our own Sinfulneſs and Ill-Deſert, obſerves, <note n="y" place="bottom">See true Religion delianated P. 391, 392:</note> 
                        <q>There can be no more of true Faith in Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe than there is of this true Humility. When Men there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appear righteous in their own Eyes, and look upon themſelves as deſerving well at the Hands of God on the Account of their own Goodneſs, they can feel no Need of a Mediator, nor at Heart have any Reſpect to Chriſt under that Character—This condemns the Faith of the ſelf-righteous Formaliſt, who depends upon his being conſcientious in his Ways, and his ſincerely endeavouring to do as well as he
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:009120_0054_1030F5D7F44996F0"/>
can to recommend him to God—This condemns alſo the Faith of the proud Enthuſiaſt, who appears ſo good in his own Eyes, ſo far from a legal Spirit, ſo purely evangelical, ſo full of Light and Knowledge, Humility and Love, Zeal and Devotion, as that from a Senſe of his own Goodneſs, and how greatly beloved he is in the Sight of God, he is emboldened to come into the Preſence of God, and draw near, and come even to his Seat and uſe Familiarity and Boldneſs with God, as though he were almoſt an Equal. Such are ſo far from any true Senſe of their own Need of Chriſt, that they feel more fit to be Mediators and Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors in behalf of others, than to want one for themſelves. It is the Way of ſuch, from that great Senſe they have of their own Goodneſs to make bold with God, and to make bold with Chriſt, in their Prayers, as if they felt themſelves pretty nigh upon a Level. <note n="x" place="bottom">Hence perhaps it is, that ſome have imbibed the Notion that true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts are made Partakers of the Eſſence of God, <hi>that is</hi> in plain Engliſh, are made Gods, which every ſober Man may ſee is blaſphemous Nonſenſe.

                     <p>Hence, I ſuppoſe it was, that ſome of the famous Reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Puritan Divines obſerved, there was a twofold Error very common in the Diſcriptions of Converſion.

To correct this Miſtake it may be obſerved in brief, That ſince it is certain Mankind have broken God's Holy Law by their Sins, they muſt of Conſequence be expoſed to its Penalty or Curſe. <q>For <note n="y" place="bottom">Gal. iii. 10.</note> curſed is every one that continueth not in all Things written in the Book of the Law to do them.</q> This Penalty or Curſe is Nothing leſs than Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Death, the everlaſting Wrath of God in Hell. For "God <note n="z" place="bottom">Rom. i. 18. and vi. 23.</note> has revealed his Wrath from Heaven againſt ALL Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and Unrighteouſneſs of Men," and "the Wages of Sin" of every Sin "is Death." Now a Law when it is broken does not admit of Repentance or any Thing that the Breaker of it can do, as a Reparation for violating it. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance how true and ſincere ſoever it may be, anſwers neither the Precept nor the Penalty of the Law. The Law requires and demands perfect, ſinleſs Obedience from firſt to laſt, or Puniſhment. This is all that Law ſays to Mankind. Hence "by <note n="a" place="bottom">Rom. ii. 20</note> the Works of the Law," by any Duties which ſinful Men can perform to it, "no Man can be juſtified." A broken Law muſt always condemn, but can never juſtify the Man that has violated it. A broken Law always worketh Wrath or Condemnation. <note n="b" place="bottom">Rom iv. 15.</note>

between him and us, that there is any more Hope for Sinful Men, than for the ſinning Angels. The firſt reaſonable Hopes which any Sinner can entertain of his Eſcape from the Wrath of God muſt ariſe from a View or Diſcovery of this glorious Redeemer in the Glaſs of the Goſpel by the Spirit of the Lord. He ſees, believes; and his Faith works by Love, and influences him to ſincere Holineſs or good Works, which, as has been already obſerved, are according to the Scripture an Evidence that his Faith is genuine and ſaving. Thus the Apoſtle Paul, <note n="f" place="bottom">2 Tim iv. 7, 8.</note> 
                        <q>I have fought a good Fight, I have finiſhed my Courſe, I have kept the Faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of Righteouſneſs—and not to me only but unto all them that love his appearing.</q> So that Men who don't perform good Works can't have Scripture Evidence that they have Saving Faith and ſhall be juſtified.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It is often aſſerted in the Scriptures that God loves Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and delights in good Works. But while Sinners remain in an unconverted State, and are not united to Jeſus Chriſt by Faith, they don't partake of the ſanctifying Influences of the Holy Spirit, and conſequently don't perform any Works which are ſpiritually good and accepted of God. <q>We are his Workmanſhip, <hi>ſays the Apoſtle;</hi> 
                           <note n="g" place="bottom">Eph. ii. 10.</note> created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good Works.</q> According to this Text Men muſt be regenerated by the Spirit before they perform any Works ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good, in a Scripture Senſe. Again the Works of the Saints themſelves are not accepted for the intrinſick Value or Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of their Duties in themſelves conſidered, but becauſe Believers who perform them are united to Chriſt, who has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned for our Sins, and who is infinitely worthy, and with whom the Father is always well pleaſed, agreeable to that of the Apoſtle. <note n="h" place="bottom">Eph. i. 6.</note> "He hath made us accepted in the Beloved." Hence the Articles of the Church of England, <q>Good Works which are the Fruits of Faith, and follow after Juſtification, cannot put away our Sins and endure the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of God's Judgment: Yet they are acceptable to God in Chriſt.—Works done before the Grace of Chriſt and the Inſpiration of his Spirit are not pleaſant to God, for as much as they ſpring not of Faith in Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:009120_0056_1030F5DD275E27D0"/>
neither do they make Men meet to receive Grace, or (as the School-Authors) deſerve Grace of Congruity: Yea ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for that they are not done as God hath commanded and willed them to be done, we doubt not but that they have the Nature of Sin.</q> Is it not certain, that while Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners remain in their unconverted unbelieving State, they are under the reigning Power of Sin, and don't trouble themſelves much about good Works, unleſs from Cuſtom, or ſome Awakenings and Remonſtrances of Conſcience, which force them ſometimes to engage a little in Religion? And even then they have ſcarcely any Regard to God. <q>When <note n="i" place="bottom">Rom. vi. 20.</note> ye were the Servants of Sin, <hi>ſays the Apoſtle,</hi> ye were free from Righteouſneſs,</q> that is, paid no proper Regard to it, were wholly deſtitute of it.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. However Sinners ſhould be ſenſible of their undone State, and of their infinite Need of the Grace of God, and wait upon him, in the Uſe of the Means he has been pleaſed to appoint, for the Beſtowment of his Favour. The famous Weſtminſter Aſſembly of Divines, who I ſhould think may be allowed to have been ſound in the Faith, teach us <q>that there are outward and ordinary Means by which Chriſt communicateth the Benefits of Redemption.</q> And though God has not limited the Beſtowment of his Grace to the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance on the Means, but may, as in the Inſtances of Paul and the Jailor, Work without and beyond them. Yet ſo far as we can diſcover by Obſervation, he more uſually meets with his profeſſing People in the Way of Mercy and Grace, while they are ſeriouſly waiting upon him in the Way of Duty. Is not this clearly implied in theſe ſolemn Words, Where having ſpoken of his giving Iſrael his profeſſing People a new Heart and a new Spirit, he adds, <q>Thus <note n="k" place="bottom">Ezek. xxxvi. 37.</note> ſaith the Lord God, I will yet for this be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael to do it for them.</q>

                     <p>The other Miſtake about Converſion which I referred to is of thoſe, who mention only a Sinner's believing, and then think they have ſaid all.

And yet according to them, the Elect were juſtified

Here we may obſerve in brief, that if Sinners ſhould reſt upon theſe Things without Chriſt, or take ſuch a Change in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of Chriſt, in Whole, or in Part, the Reproof would be juſt, and the Danger great.

Doth God ever thoroughly diſcover a Man's Sin and Miſery to him, and take his Heart from all Creatures and falſe Refuges, by ſhewing him Jeſus Chriſt and his glorious Righteouſneſs, and yet leave his Soul unrenewed and unholy? I believe for my Part, that where the Work of Converſion is ſincere, there it is entire. Sinners having by their Apoſtacy from God become unholy, they muſt be ſanctified as well as juſtified. Sin has perverted their Taſte and Reliſh for true Holineſs and the Happineſs which it affords, and thus they are become unfit for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven as well as expoſed to Hell.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Chriſt is a compleat Saviour. He ſaves his People from their Sins, and recovers them to Holineſs, as well as delivers them from Hell. Both theſe Things were neceſſary. <q>He that believeth not ſhall be damned,</q> is not more true than this <q>Without Holineſs no Man ſhall ſee the Lord, Verily, verily, Except a Man be born again, he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</q> Hence Chriſt is ſaid in the Scripture to be <q>made unto us of God, Wiſdom and Righteouſneſs, and Sanctification, and Redemption.</q> As the Goſpel is a

                     <p n="3">3. Beſides what has been already ſaid to expoſe this falſe Notion of Faith, It ſhould be remembered, that ſaving Faith is produced into the Souls of Men by the ſupernatural Agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Holy Spirit, and is repreſented in Scripture ſometimes to be a <hi>receiving</hi> Chriſt, a believing <hi>with the Heart,</hi> which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes the Will as well as the Underſtanding <q>Thy <note n="l" place="bottom">Pſalm cx. 3.

And to whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed? — As many as received him—that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in his Name were born of God.</q> Thus ſaving Faith and Regeneration are ſtrictly connected. Why ſhould not the Goſpel of Chriſt influence the Will as well as the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it is beheld in its Glory? And if it does muſt it not be wrong to confine Faith merely to the Aſſent of the Underſtanding in the grand Buſineſs of cloſing with Chriſt? But indeed the Antinomian Faith does not imply a Soul's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Chriſt or cloſing with him. It is only an Aſſent to their own good Eſtate upon ſome imaginary Revelation or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion. But right <q>Faith is the Subſtance of Things ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped for, the Evidence of Things not ſeen.</q> 
                        <hi>That is,</hi> ſuch a Kind of Reaſon and Argument, as not only gains the Aſſent of the Underſtanding, but effectually prevails with the Will, and engages the Man to act, as the Greek Word imports. <note n="m" place="bottom">Rom. v. 1.</note>

When they can believe no longer, they will be quieted in Mind no longer. If a Man ſee never the greateſt Miſchief and yet ſtrongly conceit that he is in Safety; his Conceit may make him chearful, as if all were well indeed, till his Miſery comes; and then both his Conceit and Comforts vaniſh. An un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded Perſwaſion of Happineſs is a poor Cure for real Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. When the Miſchief comes it will cure the Miſbelief; but that Belief can neither prevent nor cure the Miſchief. It there were no more to make a Man happy, but to believe that he is ſo, or ſhall be ſo; Happineſs would be far com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moner than now it is like to be. It is a Wonder that any Man who is not a Stranger both to Goſpel and Reaſon, ſhould be of the Antinomian Faith in this; who tell us that Faith is but the believing that God loveth us, and that our Sins are already pardoned through Chriſt; that this is the chief Thing that Miniſters ſhould preach; that our Miniſters
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:009120_0059_1030F5E5477D9658"/>
preach not Chriſt, becauſe they preach not this; that every Man ought thus to believe, but no Man to queſtion his Faith whether he believe truly or not, &amp;c. But if all Men muſt believe that their Sins are pardoned, then moſt of the World muſt believe a Lie: And if no Man ought to queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Truth of his Faith, then moſt Men ſhall reſt delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with an ungrounded Belief. The Scripture command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us firſt to believe for a Remiſſion of Sins, before we believe our Sins are remitted. If we believe in Chriſt, that is, accept him cordially for our Saviour and our King, then we ſhall receive the Pardon of Sins. The Truth is, we have more ado to preach down this Antinomian Faith, than they have to preach it up and to preach People from ſuch a believing, than they have to preach them to it. I ſee no Need to perſuade People ſo to believe, the Generality are ſtrong and confident in ſuch a Belief already. Take a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Five Thouſand Perſons where there has been no remarkable Convictions and Awakenings] and how few among them all will you find, that do not believe their Sins are pardoned, and that God loves them? Eſpecially of the vileſt Sinners, who have leaſt Cauſe to believe it? Indeed, as it is all the Work of thoſe Men to perſuade People to this Belief; ſo it is the hardeſt Taſk almoſt we meet with, to convince Men of the Ungroundedneſs of this Belief, and to break the Peace which Satan maintaineth in their Souls.

This is the great Engine of Hell to make Men go merrily to their own Perdition. I know Men cannot believe Chriſt or believe in, or upon Chriſt, either too ſoon, or too much. But they may believe that themſelves are pardoned, adopted, and in Favour with God, too ſoon and too much. For a falſe Judgment is always too much and too ſoon. As true grounded Faith is the Maſter-Grace in the Regenerate, and of the greateſt Uſe in the Kingdom of Chriſt; ſo is the falſe ungrounded Faith the Maſter-Vice in the unregenerate Soul and of greateſt Uſe in the Kingdom of Satan.—I would be loth to weaken the true Faith of the meaneſt Chriſtian, or to perſuade any Man that his Faith is falſe when it is true; God forbid that I ſhould

                        <hi>He now thought his Day of Grace was over, and that it was utterly in vain to ſeek for Mercy. Following this ſtrong Impreſſion he left off Praying, and ſeemed to ſink into a ſettled Deſpair, in which he continued for ſome Time. 'Twas now peculiarly diſtreſſing to him to think he would be looked upon by Mankind as a forlorn Object, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken of God. After ſome Weeks when the Ferce of the Impreſſion was worn off in a great Meaſure, at the Advice of his Friends he began to pray again for Grace and Mercy, though not with ſo much Earneſtneſs as before. And now he thought he had not been ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry wicked, though he had been betrayed into ſome Follies, but that God might pardon him. When he had continued in this Courſe ſome Time, and heard how ſundry others, who had been more openly vicious than he, had received Light and been filled with great Joy in believing, be began to be very uneaſy. He was afraid God did not regard his Prayers, though he prayed ſo very ſincerely.

He ſaw and believed that God loved him with an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Love, and accepted his Prayers. He abounded in Duties, in Prayer and Praiſe —He longed to tell others of his wonderful Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, the great Things God had done for his Soul. This was all his Diſcourſe in almoſt all Companies, urging them from hence to come and taſte that the Lord is gracious—Separations began ſoon after this—He preſently diſcovered that his Miniſter's Preaching could not edify Chriſtians. For he preached much about the Perfections of God; the Excellencies of Chriſt; the Nature of true Religion as conſiſting in Conformity to God and ſincere Obedience to the Goſpel of Chriſt; and inſiſted upon it, that good Works were a Sign of Grace. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as, Diotrephes wanted him to preach up his religious Experiences, and ſhew that good People have their Hearts filled with great Joy, when God firſt reveals to them, that he hears their Prayers and diſcovers his Love to them.

To give a Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to all his Exhortations, he pretended that he always ſpake by the Spirit, and profeſſed to live in the full Aſſurance of his Juſtification. And indeed he was never much diſpoſed to queſtion his own Goodneſs. Accordingly he taught it was one of the greatest Sins for Chriſtians to doubt of their Converſion, or ſcruple that God loved them. He defined Faith in Chriſt to be a Man's believing that Chriſt died for him in particular, ſo that for a Man to doubt of his good Eſtate was the awful Sin of Unbelief. Hence, he deſpiſed all Marks and Signs of Grace, and depended for Aſſurance on immediate Revelations of ſtrong Impulſes, which he called the immediate Witneſs of the Spirit. Had he not adopted this Notion of Aſſurance, he could never have maintained his Confidence, becauſe he was very deficient in moſt of the ſcripture Marks of a Chriſtian. For Inſtance, he was not meek and humble. He was not kind to Mankind in general. He confined any Love he had for Mankind to his own Party, and was cenſorious and unkind to all Christians of other Denominations, let them be never ſo exemplary in their Practices. He rejoiced in the Iniquities and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of ſuch as belonged to the ſtanding Churches, eſpecially of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and was very ready to miſrepreſent their Conduct in Order to blacken their Characters and raiſe Prejudices againſt them. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as he never examined himſelf by the Scripture Marks of a Saint, theſe Things never ſhaked his Confidence. A great Senſe of his eminent Labours and Services in the Goſpel, his burning Zeal, the Reproaches

Thus Satan frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tries to drive Perſons into Deſpair, ſuggeſting to them they are guilty of the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, or that their Day of Grace is paſt, or their Sins are too great to be forgiven; all which Apprehenſions have no Foundation in the Word of God, but depend entirely on particular Suggeſtions or on the Miſapplication of ſome Paſſages of Scripture.

                     <p>If Satan can thus fill Men with Horror, why may he not, if permitted, tranſport them with imaginary Joys, miſapplying the Promiſes to them. Certainly this would have a great Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to deceive them.

                     <p>Where Perſons withdraw from that Religion, which is profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in general where they live, this turns the Attention of many from the Goſpel of Chriſt, to know what they are driving at. Such Perſons, let the Cauſe of their Separation be what it will, are almoſt always extremely zealous about their Peculiarities, and lay a prodigious Streſs on them, and take unwearied Pains to make Proſelytes. For the Strength and Credit of their Party chiefly conſiſts in their Numbers. When they happen to be in the wrong, their Pride and Ambition, their Malice againſt ſuch as oppoſe them, frequently prompt to take very

unlawful Meaſures to encreaſe their Party, ſuch as miſrepreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Adverſaries and blackening their Characters to render them odious to the World. Now ſuch Conduct cannot but promote Hatred, Strife and Contention. While the careleſs World ſee profeſſing Chriſtians dividing from, and reproaching one another, and every Party confident they are right, and pleading Scripture to maintain their different Opinions and Practices; they are ready to ſuſpect that the Scriptures them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are uncertain, and that all Religion is Nothing but a Piece of Prieſtcraft. Thus the weak are ſtumbled, and Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands prejudiced againſt Religion and hardened in their Sins to their eternal Deſtruction, by Diviſions and Schiſms. Now theſe ſad Conſequences lie at their Door who go off from the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es where they live, without juſt Reaſon. For the Churches and Miniſters of Chriſt are exhorted to contend earneſtly for the Faith once delivered unto the Saints—Surely Nothing but real Neceſſity ſhould ever put any Man upon withdrawing from the Churches where he lives. If Men had a due Regard to Religion, and were not ſtrangely miſtaken; I can't but think, they would not withdraw from the ſtanding Churches among us, unleſs they could ſhew better Reaſons than any of them have yet done.

Is that Forwardneſs, which leads Men to violate the expreſs Commands of God's holy Word, a good Mark of their Converſion?</p>
                     <p>Now it is to be feared, that ſomething like Diotrephes's, is the Converſion which many among you have met with? It is indeed very probable that you will not be forward to avow, that this is the Religion you are acquainted with, becauſe it has been often expoſed, and labours under ſome Diſgrace — Men are not eaſily perſuaded to believe they are miſtaken about Religion. Their natural Pride diſpoſes them to hope well of themſelves When true and falſe Religion are often deſcribed and clearly diſtinguiſhed in Books, or in Preaching, there is hardly any Body that will lay Claim to the falſe, as their own. In ſuch Places Men's Experiences often become very orthodox, though their Practices are quite irregular. But I may leave others to judge how much Honeſty there is in this.</p>
                     <p>If you had not embraced ſome Errors about experimental Religion, why do you ſeparate from us? Why do you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtriouſly b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And whence ſhould this Notion have ariſen about your Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes in theſe Matters, and been believed by the moſt ſerious and religious Men in the Country? 'Twas very diſagreeable to many of the ſtanding Miniſtry to believe, you were ſo awfully miſtaken. You were, many of you, not only Members in our Churches, but among our warmeſt Adherents. What then could diſpoſe any of us to entertain ſuch Apprehenſions
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:009120_0063_1030F5F12C182D70"/>
of your Religion, but the ſtrongeſt Evidence? You have obliged us by your open Declaration of your religious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences; and by your ſtrange Conduct in various Inſtances have forced us, whether we would or not, to ſuſpect that you were extremely miſtaken about Religion, and many of you deluded by Satan. Yet with Reſpect to ſome of you, we would agreeable to the Scriptures make a Difference, hoping that they have only drunk in ſome unhappy Prejudices, and being Perſons of no Learning, are only guilty of ſome Blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in their Expreſſions. But if this be the Caſe with any of you, it is a Pity you ſhould be ſo tenacious of wrong Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and diſreliſh the Form of ſound Words.</p>
                     <p>However the Matter in Debate, is not, whither any of you are true Saints? How far true Saints may be left to their own Weakneſs, and the Deluſions of Satan, as David and Peter were, for a Seaſon, is beyond us to determine. It is Opinions and not Perſons I oppoſe. If I have written againſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Parties, it is becauſe they are well known to embrace the peculiar Tenets and Errors, againſt which I have levelled this Addreſs.</p>
                     <p>A Man's being gracious does not ſecure him always from Error and Deluſion. Nor is Error the more to be regarded, and loved, were it ever ſo certain, that thoſe who maintain it are truly pious Perſons. But I heartily wiſh you would give ſome better. Evidences of your Piety, than running into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Errors in Principle, and wild Extravagances in Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. It is not the moſt probable Thing in the World, that God would permit you ſo generally to embrace ſuch falſe No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Religion, if you were ſo eminently pious as you imagine. No Doubt the greater Part of erroneus Perſons are full as corrupt in their Hearts as their Heads.</p>
                     <p>Where Perſons are under any ſerious Concern, and their Conſciences in ſome Meaſure tender, they would ordinarily be a great Deal ſhocked, if Satan ſhould tempt them to ſuch groſs Wickedneſs as he did John Lewis, and the Dutartres. He is more likely to ſucceed by putting on a religious Appearance, and counterfeiting as near as may be the Enlightenings of the Divine Spirit. This is to attack Perſons in a Way they don't expect him. Now if he can by this plau<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

will as effectually anſwer his Purpoſe, as if he perſuaded them, with the unhappy Perſons abovementioned, to commit the moſt horrid Crimes.</p>
                     <p>What was the Method Satan took to abuſe that Scripture, <q>I have a few Things againſt thee, becauſe thou ſuffereſt that Woman Jezebel—Behold I will caſt her into a Bed— And I will kill her Children with Death,</q> &amp;c. Was it not by a <hi>particular</hi> Direction and powerful Impreſſion of it on the poor Wretch's Mind, as if it had <hi>immediately</hi> referred to him? Had he conſidered the true Scope, and the general Truths, which are contained in this Paſſage; he might have clearly ſeen it had no more Reference to him than to others, and could not be any Warrant to him to kill his Wife and Children. But he was carried away with the Powerful Impreſſion, and took it for granted, that it was an immediate Direction from God to him.</p>
                     <p>How was it that the <hi>Dutartres</hi> came to imagine that God had raiſed up a Prophet to them from that Text, <q>A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, of your Brethren, like unto me, him ſhall ye hear in all Things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he ſhall ſay unto you?</q> Was it not by ſome powerful Impreſſion of it on their Minds, as if it had an immediate Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to them in particular?</p>
                     <p>Few or none of you I hope have been permitted to commit ſuch horrid Crimes, in following your Impreſſions. But there are Degrees in Sin. Some Sins are more ſhockingly groſs than others. Some that are very provoking in the Sight of God, as Unbelief for Inſtance, are not reckoned ſcandalous among Mankind.

Others pretend it is revealed to them that what is ſaid in the Scriptures about Antichriſt, and the Whore of Babylon, belongs to the ſtanding Churches in New-England. And it is in vain to diſpute with them; for they ſee it, God has revealed it to them, and following theſe Impulſes and Revelations they ſeparate and pour out their bitter Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es againſt the ſtanding Miniſters and Churches.</p>
                     <p>Now whoever will examine theſe Texts will find Nothing in them to countenance ſuch Notions and Practices. There are no ſuch Truths in them as you pretend to be taught by them; from which it appears, as clear as the Sun, that if there is any Thing more in ſuch Feelings and Revelations from the Scriptures, than a heated Imagination; it muſt proceed from the poſitive Agency of a falſe Spirit on your Minds. For as the Holy Spirit is the Author of the Scriptures, this Divine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor could never teach you for Scripture Things which are not at all contained in theſe ſacred Writings.

You aſſert this with great Confidence, and boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce thoſe to be blind and carnal, who don't underſtand the particular Paſſages juſt as you are pleaſed to ſpiritualize them.</p>
                     <p>The Phraſe, Spiritual Senſe of Scripture has been uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, by ſober intelligent Chriſtians who have uſed it, to that Diſcovery of the peculiar Glory of divine Truths which God grants to his People by the ſaving Illuminations of his Spirit, they beholding in the Glaſs of the Goſpel, the Glory of the Lord. And if you will uſe the Words <hi>ſpiritual Senſe,</hi> to mean this and Nothing more, I ſhould have no Debate with you, but would rather offer ſundry Arguments to prove that none but true Saints ever behold the great Truths of the Goſpel in
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:009120_0064_1030F5F2B81EAF18"/>
their Spiritual Glory, ſince it is poſitively aſſerted by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, <note n="a" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 14.</note> that "the natural Man receiveth not the Things of the Spirit of God; for they are Fooliſhneſs unto him, neither can he know <hi>them,</hi> becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned. No Man, who is deſtitute of the Spirit of God, can be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to know the peculiar Excellencies and Glories of the divine Truths which are contained in the Goſpel. Hence Chriſtians are directed to pray for the Teachings and Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the Holy Spirit, that the Eyes of their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding may be enlightened.</p>
                     <p>But this is not what you mean by ſpiritual Senſe of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For then it would be no Support or Foundation for your new Truths, which you pretend are revealed to you from ſuch and ſuch Texts of Scripture. When the Minds of Sinners are enlightened by the Spirit of God, in the Scheme of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt, as delivered in the Goſpel, they only ſee the Truths which are already revealed by the Spirit in the written Word. Divine Light may ſhew Men what is in the Scriptures, eſpecially their eminent Excellency and Glory, but it does not diſcover new Truths and Duties, not contained in the Bible. So that the ſpiritual Senſe of the Scriptures in this Acceptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Phraſe is Nothing to your Purporſe. It could be no Advantage to your Scheme.</p>
                     <p>Hence your ſpiritual Meaning or Senſe of Scripture is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret myſtical Senſe, which you imagine is communicated to you by immediate Revelation, and by which you know new Truths and Duties. The Scriptures according to you, have a literal and carnal Senſe, and a myſtical and ſpiritual Senſe, hidden and wrapped up under it, as in a Riddle or Allegory. The carnal or unconverted, ſee only the literal and carnal Senſe of the Scriptures, but you being ſpiritual and gracious Perſons are inſtructed in the ſecret and ſpiritual Senſe of the Bible. Let us examine theſe Things.</p>
                     <p>Every Speaker, who uſes Words with Propriety has ſome Deſign in View, and of Conſequence ſome determinate Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fixed to his Words, whether he uſes plain Language or Metaphors, and Parable. When we fully underſtand this Meaning, we have the whole Senſe he intended. If we miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take his Meaning and Deſign, we can't be ſaid rightly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="110" facs="unknown:009120_0065_1030F5F44AAF7558"/>As God has been pleaſed to ſpeak to us in human Languages moſt certainly he ſpeaks with the greateſt Propritety: And therefore the Senſe is moſt fixed and determinate. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were deſigned for the common Uſe of Mankind, for the Unlearned as well as the Learned, and are therefore penned in an eaſy familiar Style, in ſuch Language and Words, as were commonly uſed among Men when they were written. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times Metaphors and Parables are uſed to ſtrike Men's Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a more lively Manner, and to teach them plain Truths, which are clearly revealed in other Paſſages of Scripture. <note n="b" place="bottom">And it ſeems ſometimes to conceal them. See Mark iv. 11, 12.</note> Typical Repreſentations were often uſed under the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prefigure Jeſus Chriſt the promiſed Saviour. But ſince Chriſt is come, ſuch typical Repreſentations are become leſs neceſſary, and ſo not much uſed in the New-Teſtament. <q>We, <hi>ſays the Apoſtle,</hi> uſe great Plainneſs of Speech and not as Moſes which put a Vail over his Face.</q>

                     </p>
                     <p>Since God deſigned to teach us Something in every Paſſage of Scripture, when we comprehend what this is, what Inſtructions are contained in it, we ſee the true Meaning of that particular Paſſage. If we don't ſee what was God's Meaning and Deſign in any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Paſſage, we don't underſtand that Paſſage, at leaſt the true Meaning of it. Thus every Scripture, whither plain or parabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical, has ſome Deſign, ſome determinate Senſe. It contains ſome certain Truths, and no other. When the Paſſage is parabolical and typical, it muſt be explained to diſcover theſe Truths which it contains.</p>
                     <p>The Scriptures were deſigned <hi>for,</hi> and are ſent <hi>to</hi> Mankind in general, both Saints and Sinners. They are uſed as a Means to convince and convert Sinners; to edify Saints; and to leave im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Unbelievers inexcuſeable in their Sins. Theſe Ends could not be anſwered by the Scriptures, unleſs they were in ſome good Meaſure intelligible to all both Saints and Sinners God declares that <q>he had not ſpoken in ſecret; and that his Commandment was not hidden.</q> 
                        <note n="d" place="bottom">Iſaiah xlv. 19 Deut xxx. 11.</note> It was not his Deſign to hide and conceal the Truths of his Word from the unregenerate, but to reveal them to all in general in the plaineſt Manner. To teach therefore that unconverted Sinners can't have any Underſtanding of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is to oppoſe God, and to endeavour to fruſtrate one great

End for which he gave them. When the holy Spirit convinces Men of their Sins, does he not often improve the Truths con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Scriptures? And don't convinced Sinners believe the Truths, which the Spirit improves in convincing them? And are not many awakened Sinners, with Felix, when he trembled under Paul's Preaching, ſtill in an unconverted State? If un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Sinners could know nothing at all about the Truth contained in the Goſpel, how could they be left inexcuſeable in their Sins? Or how could it be juſt in God to condemn them to an aggravated Puniſhment?</p>
                     <p>Hence, though unconverted Sinners don't ſee the eminent Glory of the Lord in the Glaſs of the Goſpel, yet they may, and often do ſee th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> it is true, and are frequently much affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the Truths which it contains. And thus <hi>your Notion</hi> of a carnal Meaning, which is underſtood only by carnal Men; and a ſpiritual Meaning which true Converts underſtand has no juſt Foundation. The Scriptures were penned by the Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Spirit, and treat chiefly about ſpiritual Things, and Men are brought to ſee their real Excellency and peculiar Glory by the Illuminations of the Spirit. How then can they have a carnal Meaning? Chriſt the great Antitype is come. Why would you turn the New-Teſtament into Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures? Is not this to throw Shadows and Darkneſs inſtead of Light upon the Goſpel? But this will appear plainer while I briefly point out ſome of the Marks and Characters of your ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Meaning which you put on the Scriptures.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. Your ſpiritual Senſe of Scripture has no Connexion with its true or real Senſe. For Inſtance, <q>Jeſus then cometh and taketh Bread and giveth them, and Fiſh likewiſe.</q> Real Senſe; <q>Chriſt on a certain Occaſion diſtributed Bread and Fiſh to his Diſciples.</q> Your ſpirituall Senſe, <q>Bread and Fiſh mean Divine Light, Comfort and Joy.</q> Jeſus gives this ſpiritual Food, theſe divine Manifeſtations, not to the World but to his true Diſciples, his poor perſecuted Followers, <hi>that is,</hi> yourſelves. Now any unprejudiced Perſon may ſee this ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Meaning has no Connexion with, nor real Foundation in the Text.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Your ſpiritual Meaning is ſuch a Meaning as no ſober Man, let him have ever ſo much Grace and Penetration, can ſee in the Text; and yet a blind, unconverted Sinner can under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:009120_0066_1030F5F787B9D438"/>
it if he pleaſes. Divine Influences and ſaving Illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion don't help a Man in the leaſt, to diſcern your ſpiritual Senſe of Scripture. For many who are favoured with a large Share of ſaving Light and Knowledge are quite Strangers to your ſpiritual Meanings. But ſome carnal Men are very well acquainted with them. <q>Thus <note n="e" place="bottom">1 Kings, i. 1—16.</note> David's Servants ſaid unto him, let there be ſought for my Lord the King a young Virgin, and let her ſtand before the King, and let her cheriſh him; and let her lie in thy Boſom, that my Lord the King may get Heat. So they ſought for a fair Damſel—and found Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhag,</q> &amp;c. Your ſpiritual Senſe of this Paſſage is briefly, <q>This fair Damſel that cheriſhed King David was his Faith. This lay in his Boſom and made him lively and warm in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</q> A carnal Sinner can immediately underſtand this Meaning without any Illuminations of the Spirit.</p>
                     <p n="3">3 Your ſpiritual Senſe not only has no Connexion with the real Senſe, but is often quite contrary to it. Thus, <q>Let your Women keep Silence in the Churches—and if they will learn any Thing, let them aſk their Huſbands at Home." Spiritual Meaning; "Chriſt is their Huſband, the Church is their Home. Therefore Women who are married to Chriſt by Faith may ſpeak in the Church.</q> Here you ſee plainly, that the ſpiritual Senſe is quite contrary to the true Senſe. Thus again, <q>Thou haſt had five Huſbands, and he, whom thou now haſt, is not thy Huſband.</q> Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Senſe; <q>Thou haſt had five falſe Hopes, and that Hope which thou now haſt is not a true Hope,</q> directly contrary to the real Meaning and Deſign of the Words.</p>
                     <p>In fine, by ſuch Spiritualizings, any Thing and every Thing or Nothing, may be made out of any Scripture, as the Fancies of Men pleaſe. There is no Reaſoning with ſuch Men from Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Allow your ſpiritual Senſe, and we can't eſtabliſh any Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, nor confute any Error by the moſt expreſs Scripture For it is eaſy for you to ſay, we take the Scriptures in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral, carnal Senſe; but you have the ſpiritual Meaning of the Texts to Confirm you in your Opinion; or that you are not taught the ſpiritual Senſe of the Texts brought to confute you. So that when Perſons pretend to ſet up ſuch Spiritualizings of
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:009120_0066_1030F5F787B9D438"/>
Scripture, they in Fact ſet the Bible aſide. Now from whom do you think ſuch Notions could ſpring? Who is it that is moſt induſtriouſly imployed in getting rid of the Bible?</p>
                     <p>The Hiſtory of the Fall of Man, the Miracles of Chriſt, &amp;c. have been ſpiritualized after this Manner, that is, explained away by ſome Writers. But no Parts of Scripture have been more ſpiritualized, than the Revelation and the Song of Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The ingenious Mr. Lowman has commented very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellently on the Revelation, reſcuing the ſacred Text from many Spiritualizers, and explaining the real Import of the Language and the general Deſign of the Book.</p>
                     <p>Since the Song of Solomon was ranked among the Jewiſh Scriptures, according to Inſpiration, which would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any ſpurious Production to be placed in the ſacred Canon; ſince Chriſt has declared, that the Scriptures cannot be broken; and Paul has expreſsly aſſerted that all Scripture, <hi>that is,</hi> the whole Old-Teſtament is given by Inſpiration; it would be very abſurd to queſtion its divine Authority. The following brief Account perhaps may be uſeful to point out the general De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and the right Method of explaining this celebrated Song.</p>
                     <p>Huſbands and Wives mutually love one another. This mutual Love which is between Huſband and Wife may be uſed to repreſent that Love which is between Chriſt and his true Followers. The Spirit of God has made Uſe of Marriage to repreſent it in ſundry plain Paſſages of Scripture. As Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was a Type of Chriſt, the Love which he and Pharaoh's Daughter had for each other, is pitched on as a particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or Emblem, to repreſent the Love that is between Chriſt and his People. This grand Truth is repreſented in this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Song, which is written after the Manner of Paſtorals, by a great Variety of beautiful Images, in a very ſtriking Manner, agreeable to the Cuſtoms, of the Jews, and the Eaſtern Taſte. From the whole of this Song we learn this great Truth, <q>that there is a mutual ſtrong Love between Chriſt and true Believers." This is celebrated here in a every lively Manner. There is no Need to wring the Expreſſions to force out of them uncertain Niceties. <note n="f" place="bottom">Dr. Owen.</note>

                     <p>God ſometimes taught his People by Hieroglyphicks or Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols. But it would be very wild to infer from this, that all the Scriptures are hieroglyphical. If God has revealed any where in his Word, that any particular Perſons or Things were ſymbolical (as he has ſometimes done in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by Chriſt and his Apoſtles) then we have a ſufficient Warrant to explain them, as Types or Hieroglyphicks. But where God has not told us that Perſons or Hiſtories were Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical, how is it poſſible for us to know it? Should not we ſtop where God has ſtopped? Muſt not all beyond this be mere Imagination and Deluſion?</p>
                     <p>Had Men been contented to have made Scripture the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter of Scripture, and not attempted to find out imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Myſteries, which are no where revealed, many ſtrange Interpretations might have been happily prevented.</p>
                     <p>Common Readers, I ſuppoſe, can ſee ſo much in the plain Meaning of the Book of Job, as to be greatly benefited by the Example of Patience, which is ſet before them in this eminent Perſon; and the Serious Inſtructions and ſublime Sentiments, which are delivered in the various Diſcourſes, that paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his Friends, on Occaſion of his Afflictions, &amp;c. But many ſuppoſe this Book to be a dramatick Piece, a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Repreſentation. Who can tell how far they are right? On this Suppoſition this Book muſt have a hidden, myſtical, ſpiritual Meaning. Fancy muſt be ſet to Work to find it out. And as it is not revealed in Scripture, when or by whom the Book of Job was written, Imagination has a large Field to range in.

                     <p>As Job is repreſented to have lived in the Land of Uz, and the Names of ſome of his Friends are ſuch as were common among the Deſcendants of Eſau. Another may imagine, this Book was written to comfort the Edomites, when they were carried away captive, and ſubjected to grievous Calamities. His Proſperity may repreſent their Reſtoration; or their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to Chriſtianity. Another may imagine, the Book of Job was written by Ezra for the Support and Comfort of the Jews, after the Babyloniſh Captivity: That Job repreſents the returning Jews, his three Friends, whom he called miſerable Comforters, the falſe Friends or Enemies of the Jews, Sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Is it not a Pity they don't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that, ſince the myſtical Meaning of this Book, if it has any, is not revealed in Scripture, they can never find it out? Is it not egregious Folly for Men to pretend to be wiſe above what is written? If ſome ſelf-conceited contemptuous Writers were ever likely to read this Addreſs, or capable of taking Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from me, I would recommend it to them, when they are ſeized with this Fondneſs for Myſticiſm and Allegory, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine themſelves to the Metamorphoſis of Ovid, Apulius, or the Dreams of Arremidorus They will ſpend their Time more innocently in finding out the Myſteries of the Heathens, than in torturing the Holy Scriptures, and they may appear quite as Learned.—To return,</p>

If he ſhould come and tell you with a great Deal of Heat and Zeal, that the ſpiritual Meaning of a hundred Pounds was not a hundred Pounds of Money, but a hundred Words, Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Viſits, or the like, would you not think be was mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly impudent, or diſtracted?

How dare any Man take that Freedom with the Scriptures, which he would not allow his Neighbour in explaining a trifling Note or Bond, where his temporal Property was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned?</p>
                     <p>Indeed there was a Neceſſity on you, who ſet up to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horters, to give into this Notion of Spiritualizing the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, from your great Ignorance of their true Meaning. I am very ſerious, and remember while I am writing, I muſt render a moſt ſtrict and impartial Account of my Conduct at God's awful Bar. And under this ſolemn Senſe of the laſt Judgment on my Mind, I moſt ſeriouſly declare, it is my firm Opinion, that ſuch is the Ignorance which prevails among both your Teachers and People, who have ſeparated from us, that all of you together could ſcarcely explain the true Senſe of one ſingle Leaf of the Bible. So that your Teachers are obliged to ſpiritualize and pervert the Scriptures, or elſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear holding forth.—It ſeems alſo they find their Account in this ſpiritualizing, in drawing ſundry after them; for ſome are wonderfully pleaſed to find ſtrange Myſteries in plain Texts. Who could have thought, <hi>ſay they,</hi> ſuch a wonderful Diſcourſe could have been made out of ſuch a Text? Some will always be beſt pleaſed with new and ſtrange Things, which they don't underſtand!</p>
                     <p n="1">1. But I expect to be told that I deny all the Teachings of the Spirit, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>To which I anſwer, the Spirit of God teaches by giving us the Scriptures; and by impreſſing the real Senſe, the general Truths, that are contained in them on Men's Minds, as has been already explained. If therefore after this, any of you ſhall dare to aſſert, or inſinuate, that I deny the Operations of the Spirit, I muſt look on it as a Specimen of wilful Malice and Deceit; ſince you can't but know, it is only your abſurd ſpiritualizing of Scripture, which I diſcard.</p>

But what if Divines had ſpiritualized the Scripture in the Method, which I have endeavoured to expoſe? Does that make it right, when it is ſo evidently wrong? I have long ſince learned, that I ſhould call no Man Father or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter upon Earth. Should we follow Men any further than they follow Chriſt and Truth?</p>
                     <p>Many of the beſt Divines have warmly remonſtrated againſt this Spiritualizing Scripture from the Beginning of the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The excellent Dr. Doddridge obſerves on 2 Cor. iii. 6. Not of the Letter, but of the Spirit] <q>To underſtand this of an Allegorical (that is a Spiritual) rather than literal Explication of the Old Teſtament is very Arbitrary and Unwarrantable. And I wiſh no Chriſtian Commentators had given Encouragement to the Deiſts, to abuſe this Text in the Manner it is well known they have done.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now when the Deiſts thus ſtrongly arm themſelves from the Spiritualizings of Enthuſiaſts, and ſome weak Brethren, who have inadvertently embraced ſome of their Interpretations, is it not high Time to expoſe this Method of explaining the Bible? Should we for Fear of diſpleaſing ſome weak Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, quietly ſit ſtill and be ſilent; until Enthuſiaſts have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually prepared the Way for Deiſts to diſcard the Scriptures, or bring them into Contempt, as a Syſtem of unintelligible miſtical Jargon.</p>
                     <p>If I have quoted from the Writings of ſome Divines, this is to ſhew that I am not ſingular, ſince many, whoſe Praiſes are in the Churches of Chriſt, have been of the ſame Opinion.— But ſince it is one of the Artifices of unfair Opponents to Charge thoſe that write againſt them, with any exceptionable Expreſſions or Notions they think they have found in the Books quoted from, or approved of in general; I here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire it may be remarked, as I receive Nothing on any human Authority, I undertake to defend no Men's Peculiarities.

                     <p>It will be no unneceſſary Digreſſion to give a brief Specimen of your Manner of Reaſoning from Scripture, agreeable to your Spiritualizings about Baptiſm, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="1">i. It is certain from the Scriptures, that God ſent John the Baptiſt to baptize with Water. For his Baptiſm was from Heaven, of Divine Appointment. Chriſt himſelf was baptized with Water. Chriſt's Diſciples, who were careful to obey his Directions, baptized while he lived with them before his Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifiction. When he took his Leave of them, and aſcended into Heaven, he commanded them <q>to teach and baptize all Nations.</q> They were well acquainted with his Manner of Speaking and Language, and they underſtood his Command,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:009120_0069_1030F5FFA6DB4400"/>
"Baptize," of receiving Perſons into the viſible Church by Water-Baptiſm, which, it ſeems, was the known and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Senſe of the Word. For to baptize with the Holy Ghoſt, and with Fire, is evidently a metaphorical Phraſe, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified their ſharing plentifully in the Influences of the Divine Spirit. Thus, elſe where, Chriſt uſes the Metaphor of Baptiſm to ſignify his dreadful Sufferings and Death. <note n="g" place="bottom">Acts ii. 38. and x. 47, 48.</note> 
                        <q>Are ye able to be baptized with the Baptiſm I am to be baptized with?</q> But to baptize with Water, as John the Baptiſt did, was the proper and common Senſe of the Word. So the Apoſtles underſtood it, and ſo they practiſed. <note n="h" place="bottom">Matt. xx. 22.</note> Peter ſaid to the three thouſand, <q>Repent, and be baptized, every one of you in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the Remiſſion of Sins, and ye ſhall receive the Gift of the Holy Ghoſt.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Their ſharing in the Gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, or being baptized with the Holy Ghoſt, did not ſuperſede the Neceſſity of being baptized with Water. No, <q>Can any Man forbid Water,</q> 
                        <hi>ſaid Peter</hi> 
                        <note n="i" place="bottom">Acts x. 47, 48.</note> 
                        <hi>with Reſpect to Cornelius and other Gentile Converts,</hi> 
                        <q>who have received the Holy Ghoſt as well as we. And he commanded them to be baptized in the Name of the Lord.</q> Though therefore Peter and Paul, as appears from ſome Paſſages, did not ordinarily baptize themſelves, being chiefly employed in Preaching the Goſpel; yet they were careful in commanding that Baptiſm with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhould not be neglected. Philip who was under the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Direction of the Spirit, baptized the Eunuch with Water. Thus Baptiſm by Water was conſtantly practiſed by the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. This is the <hi>one Baptiſm</hi> which they ſpeak of. And this Baptiſm was frequently accompanied with the Influences of the Holy Spirit. Some might lay too great a Streſs upon Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in their Days, as the Papiſts have done ſince, and others who teach that Men are regenerated by Baptiſm. To correct the Miſtake of ſuch, Peter plainly tells them, that they were not to look ſo much to their being baptized with Water, as to their living anſwerable to their Promiſes in that holy Ordinance. <note n="k" place="bottom">1 Pet.</note> 
                        <q>Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us, not the putting away of the Filth of the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, by the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt.</q> Which
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:009120_0070_1030F604BB78D698"/>
ſhews that Baptiſm by Water, was then practiſed; that the Apoſtle, approved of it, but would not have too great Streſs laid upon it, conſidered merely in itſelf.</p>
                     <p>Now who, that conſiders that Baptiſm by Water was of Divine Inſtitution, was never repealed, but was enjoined by Chriſt, and practiſed by his Apoſtles, would think any Man would pretend to prove from their Writings, that it ſhould be diſregarded? Would they not have been the moſt inconſiſtent of all Men, if they had thus taught one Thing and conſtantly practiſed the contrary? If they had wrote againſt Water-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, when they were thus careful to ſee that it was adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered? Barclay was ſo intent on the figurative or ſpiritual Senſe of Scripture, that he quite overlooked its real Senſe and plain Scope; and therefore could not ſee any Divine Warrant for Baptiſm with Water in all the New-Teſtament; yet he could ſee it clearly forbidden in theſe Words of John, Chriſt's Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger, "He muſt encreaſe but I muſt decreaſe." <note n="l" place="bottom">Apol. Of Baptiſm. P. 423. John iii. 31.</note> Which muſt beſure be the ſpiritual Senſe of the Text, ſince in its real Senſe it ſays Nothing more nor leſs about Baptiſm at all. A Man had Need of the Second Sight to ſee any Thing in theſe Words againſt Water-Baptiſm. But ſuch are the Reaſonings of thoſe who pretend to follow the ſpiritual Senſe of Scripture!</p>
                     <p n="2">ii. Thus alſo others of you declare, with equal Reaſon and Poſitiveneſs as Barclay againſt Infant-Baptiſm, as if it was merely a vain Invnetion of Men, and a very ſinful Obſervance.</p>
                     <p>It is certain from the Scriptures that God held Adam's natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Poſterity bound with him, in that Law or Covenant which he gave him in his State of Innocency. God curſed the Ground for the Sake of Adam's Tranſgreſſion, and his Poſterity in all their Generations have felt the ſad Effects of his Apoſtacy. It is likewiſe certain, that God bound Abraham's natural Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as well as himſelf, when he ratified his Covenant with him by Circumciſion, which was, according to the Apoſtle Paul, a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith or Coveant of Grace. Now the Covenant of Grace was never yet repealed. Conſequently the Grant, which God made in it in Favour of the Infant Seed of his People, ſtill remains in full Force and Virtue. This is the plain Senſe of theſe Scripture-Accounts.—'Tis true

Length of Time does not change the Nature of Right and Wrong. Whatſoever was wrong in itſelf under the Old-Teſtament, is ſo ſtill. If therefore it be in itſelf abſurd, wrong and ſinful, to take Children into Covenant now, it was ſo alſo under the Old-Teſtament. It becomes you to be a little more careful how you expreſs yourſelves on this Subject. Indifferent Things may be aboliſhed, but nothing that is in itſelf wrong and ſinful can ever be commanded by God. Do you think Circumciſion referred only to earthly Riches? Or that all the Saints of Old were under no other but a ſtrict Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Works?</p>

Since many are thus called and but few choſen; there is no Neceſſity, nor ſufficient Reaſon, to reſtrain this to an effectual Call in this Place. The Covenant and Promiſe, then, under the Goſpel extends to the Children of Chriſtan Profeſſors as well as themſelves. Yea if only one of the Parents

of a Child be a profeſſed Chriſtian, yet even in ſuch a Caſe the Child is to be treated as a Subject of the viſible Covenant and Church. <note n="n" place="bottom">1 Cor. vii. 14.</note> 
                        <q>The unbelieving Huſband is ſanctified by the Wife and the unbelieving Wife is ſanctified by the Huſband: elſe were your Children unclean; but now are they holy.</q> This does not mean that they are really or ſincerely holy. For many excellent Chriſtians have had ungodly Children. The Senſe then evidently is that the Children of Chriſtian Parents, or where only one of them profeſſes Chriſt, are viſibly holy by being in Covenant along with their Parents. Thus, according to the Apoſtle the Children of Chriſtian Parents are holy, and of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence proper Subjects of Baptiſm. Why ſhould we refuſe to baptize Children and receive them into the viſible Church when God has thus expreſsly aſſured us they are holy?</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Some brought little Children to Chriſt, that he ſhould touch them, and his Diſciples rebuked thoſe that brought them. But when Jeſus ſaw it he was much diſpleaſed, and ſaid unto them, Suffer little Children to come unto me and forbid them not, for of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.— And he took them up in his Arms, put his Hands upon them and bleſſed them. <note n="o" place="bottom">Mark x. 13.—16.</note>
                        </q> The Kingdom of Chriſt in this Paſſage, muſt mean either the Kingdom of Glory above, or the Goſpel-Church in this World. If little Children belong to the Kingdom of Glory, why ſhould we refuſe to admit them into the viſible Church by Baptiſm? Would Men have their Churches in this World purer than Heaven itſelf? But if the Kingdom of God in this Text ſhould be taken in the ſecond Senſe, as meaning the viſible Church or Kingdom which he has erected in the World, then, this Paſſage is a direct Proof for Infant Baptiſm; ſince this is the Ordinance by which they were made viſible Members. Such is the plain Senſe of this Paſſage, and the Conſequence which is fairly derived from it.</p>
                     <p>But the Spiritual Senſe which ſome of you put upon it is, <q>Theſe who were brought to Chriſt were not little Children in Age and Stature, but true Converts who reſembled lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Children in their Temper and Diſpoſition.</q> 
                        <hi>That is,</hi> Chriſt took up grown Perſons in his Arms, who, it may be, were Thirty, Forty, Sixty, or Seventy Years old. —

Such could have come to Chriſt themſelves, without being brought by their Parents or Guardians. To ſuch pitiful Shifts are Men drove, to defend their Errors. To mention ſuch an Interpretation is to expoſe it.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. But Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, Go and teach all Nations baptizing them in the Name of the Father, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Anſ. What then? According to your own Interpretation of this Text, it does not refer to Infants, but to grown adult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But how will you confute Infant Baptiſm from a Text which you grant has no Reference at all to it? Suppoſe I ſhould allow for Argument's Sake, that Infant Baptiſm could not be proved from this Text; that would be no good Reaſon againſt it, ſince, as I have ſhewed, it may be proved from other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The Lord's Supper is not expreſsly mentioned in this Text. Will you admit this to be a good Proof, that Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſhould not ſhew forth the Lord's Death in this Ordinance according to his command in other Scriptures? All Things could not poſſibly be taught in one Text. But how can any reaſonable, unprejudiced Man ſuppoſe the Apoſtles underſtood this Commiſſion. "Teach and baptize all Nations? Muſt they not have underſtood it as comprehending Infants, when they knew they were received as Members of the Jewiſh Church at eight Days old, by Circumciſion? And when they well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered the ſharp Rebuke, which Chriſt gave them for attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to hinder little Children from coming to him? Had any Inſinuations been made by the Apoſtles againſt Children; had they excluded them from the viſible Church; no Doubt their Enemies the Jews, would have made a loud Complaint againſt them for cutting off their Infant-Seed from the Lord. But there are no Intimations in the whole New-Teſtament of any ſuch Objections and Complaints being made againſt them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. But there is no expreſs Example to prove that Infants were baptized.</p>
                     <p>Anſ. When Lydia was converted to Chriſtianity, <note n="p" place="bottom">Acts xvi. 14, 15. and 33.</note> not only ſhe herſelf, but alſo her houſhold were baptized.

The Apoſtle Paul baptized the Houſhold of Stephanas. <note n="q" place="bottom">1 Cor. i. 16.</note> How can you prove that there were no Children in theſe Families? Is it by a ſtrong Imagination, or a violent Impulſe, or ſome new Revelation?</p>

As I have been informed it is your Cuſtom, when you pretend to plunge Perſons, eſpecially in cold Weather, to bundle up the Men, not only in their ordinary wearing Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, but alſo in ſundry great Coats ſometimes; and the Women in many Cloaths, Wrappers, Mufflers, &amp;c. You muſt give me Leave to aſk you, what Scripture you have for ſuch a Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice? When Perſons are baptized, ſhould not the Water be applied to their Bodies ſome Way or other? Can they be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be baptized at all, when the Water is applied chiefly to their Cloaks and Wrappers? Is not this rather a plunging and ſoaking of their Cloaths, than a baptizing of themſelves? Have you any expreſs Command or Example in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Perſons who were thus bundled up in great Coats and Wrappers, in Order to be baptized by plunging without wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Skin?

                     <p>What has been already aſſerted, and clearly proved, againſt all immediate Impulſes and Revelations in our Day might ſerve to confute your Pretences to an immediate Call to the Miniſtry.

Thus Moſes was immediately called to bring the Children of Iſrael out of Egypt. Thus ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Prophets, as Samuel, Jeremiah, Jonah, Amos, for Inſtance, were called. Thus the Apoſtles were called. Paul was a moſt remarkable Inſtance of this immediate Call.</p>
                     <p>Now in this Senſe, you hold your Teachers are called. I ſuppoſe Barclay ſpeaks the true Senſe of you all, when he ſays, <q>That none can be made Officers in the Church, but—by inward Revelations of the Spirit, (not by outward Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)

                     <p>This immediate, Divine Call is not a Perſon's Mind being enlightened by the Spirit of God, in the true meaning of ſome Paſſages in Scripture; but is intirely a new Revelation. Let a Man's Mind be ever ſo much inlightened in the <hi>true Senſe</hi> of the whole Scriptures, he can never ſee, nor infer from them, that he is immediately called to be a Miniſter to preach, in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Place; to ſuch a People; ſuch a Time; becauſe there is no ſuch Thing in the Bible, that he, ſuch a one by Name, is called to this Station. True Light will indeed diſcover what is in Scripture, but does not help in the leaſt to ſee thoſe Things which are not in it at all. If therefore any Man be called to the Miniſtry in an immediate Way, this Call muſt be a quite new Revelation.</p>
                     <p>Examples ſerve greatly to illuſtrate Things. Let us then briefly conſider the Example of the Apoſtle Paul. When Chriſt immediately called this violent Perſecutor to preach the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel to the Gentiles, this was as much a new Revelation as any that ever was made. It could not be inferred from all that God had revealed to his Church before. An Impreſſion on his Mind of ſomething, that God had ſaid to ſome of his ancient Prophets, as Elijah, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, &amp;c. would not do in this Caſe, be it ever ſo clear and ſtrong; for this plain Reaſon, Perſecuting Saul was not the ſame Man. He was not Elijah, nor Iſaiah, nor Jeremiah, nor Amos, &amp;c. but Saul of Tarſus. Therefore the Call directed to them, could be no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Call to him.</p>
                     <p>Let us for once ſuppoſe, that ſuch an Impreſſion had been made on his Mind, and he had looked on it as a Divine Call to the Miniſtry, he muſt alſo have looked on it, as immediately directed to him; and then as to the Senſe of the Scripture-Words that were thus impreſſed, this would have been intirely new, which would in Fact have rendered it to him, not an old, but wholly a new Revelation. The Scripture reveals that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu, the Son of Jehoſhaphat, was called to be King over Iſrael;
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:009120_0075_1030F6121425F968"/>
and that Jeremiah of Anachoth was called to be a Prophet to the Jews. But how ſhall any Man at this Diſtance reaſonably infer from hence that he is immediately called to be a King, or a Goſpel-Miniſter? A new Revelation is as much needed to teach him this, as if the Scriptures had not revealed one Word about <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. I have clearly explained this the more largely, becauſe I ſuppoſe, it will in ſome Meaſure diſcover, what Sort of Evidence Men, who pretended to this immediate Call, muſt produce to juſtify their great Pretenſions. Every One, who is acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his Bible, may remember that Miracles wrought in a publick open Manner are the Seal of God, by which he atteſts the Truth of new Revelations. This was the Evidence which he bore to the Truth of the Old-Teſtament. This was the Seal by which he teſtified the Truth of the New in the Time of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. Now if we carefully view the Temper of Mankind at preſent, it ſhould ſeem, there is as much Need of Miracles to prove the Truth of a Revelation, that ſhould be made now, as there was in thoſe ancient Times. Is the World grown ſo much better? Are not Men as natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prone to Unbelief as ever? If they are, is there not Need of the ſame Sort of Evidence to prove the Truth of New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations, which was formerly granted to recommend them?</p>
                     <p>The Lord ſeems to have given us juſt Grounds to expect Miracles, from thoſe who profeſs to come with a new Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and an immediate Call, by his Conduct towards Moſes, when he gave him that immediate Commiſſion to bring the Children of Iſrael out of Egypt. Moſes himſelf had ſufficient Evidence that God called him. But he was a Man of too good Senſe, and too well acquainted with Mankind, to think, that his telling others what he had ſeen and felt, would be reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Evidence to them, that the Lord had given him that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Commiſſion. Therefore he humbly deſired to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how he ſhould ſurmount this Difficulty; and the Lord aſſured him he would grant him the inconteſtable Evidence of Miracles, to prove his immediate Divine Call. This remar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kable Paſſage is ſo very pertinent to my Purpoſe, that it would be Injuſtice to my Argument not to tranſcribe it intire.</p>

And he ſaid, Caſt it on the Ground; and he caſt it on the Ground, and it became a Serpent, and Moſes Fled from before it. And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Put forth thine Hand, and take it by the Tail. And he put forth his Hand and caught it, and it became a Rod in his Hand. That they may believe that, the Lord God of their Fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Iſaac, and the God of Jacob hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto thee. And the Lord ſaid furthermore unto him, Put now thine Hand into thy Boſom: And he put his Hand into his Boſom, and when he took it out, behold his Hand was leprous as Snow. And he ſaid, Put thy Hand into thy Boſom; and he put his Hand into his Boſom again, and plucked it out of his Boſom, and behold it was turned again as his <hi>other</hi> Fleſh. And it ſhall come to paſs if they will not believe thee, nor hearken to the Voice of the firſt Sign, that they will believe the Voice of the latter Sign.

                     <p>Thus the Lord, having ſent Moſes with an immediate Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Children of Iſrael, gave him ſuch Credentials, as were ſufficient to prove in the cleareſt Manner to all concerned that he had called him. It ſeems they would have been guilty of unreaſonable Haſtineſs and Inadvertency; if they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Moſes on his own bare Affirmation. The Lord, who called him, aſſured him, he would ſupport him in diſcharging his Commiſſion. Now is it not ſtill ſuitable to the Perfections of God, and does not the Nature of Things require, that he ſhould, in ſome ſuch convincing Manner, maintain the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of all thoſe whom he calls immediately to any Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice?</p>

                     <p>Does not our Bleſſed Lord plainly teach us, we have a Right to inſiſt on ſome other Evidence of a Man's immediate Call than his own SAY SO, in the following Paſſages. <note n="y" place="bottom">John v 31, 32 &amp;c.</note> 
                        <q>If I bear Witneſs of myſelf, my Witneſs is not true.</q> 
                        <hi>That is,</hi> If I produce no other Witneſs or Proof of my divine Miſſion, but my own Affirmation, this is not to be admitted as true. It would not be ſufficient Evidence for you to act upon. You could not be blamed for rejecting me, if I gave you no other Teſtimony than this. Hence, Chriſt appealed to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of John the Baptiſt, who was known to be an eminent Prophet; and to the glorious Miracles which he himſelf per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. <q>The Works which the Father hath given me to finiſh, the ſame Works that I do, bear Witneſs of me, that the Father hath ſent me.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Agreeable to this, is that celebrated Paſſage of his ſolemn Diſcourſe, which he had with his Diſciples immediately before he was betrayed. <q>If I had not come and ſpoken unto them they had not had Sin; but now they have no Cloak for their Sin. <note n="z" place="bottom">John xv. 22, 24.</note> If I had not done among them the Works which none other Man did, they had not had Sin; but now they have both ſeen, and hated, both me and my Father.</q> If Chriſt had not given ſufficient Evidence, and wrought Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to prove his divine Miſſion; it would have been no Sin to have rejected him. Since therefore Chriſt has declared, it was neceſſary for him, who was the ſupreme Lord of all, to give ſuch Evidences; ſince he did not think fit to require any to acknowledge and receive him, 'till he had fully proved that God had ſent him; this plainly teaches us we have a Right to demand due Evidence from thoſe who pretend to come in his Name, before we ſubmit to their Miniſtrations. Such who pretend to an immediate Call, and require us to receive them, without bringing any Evidence but their own Affirmation, pretend to higher Authority, than Chriſt himſelf ever did. But Chriſt has declared it was unreaſonable for the Servant to expect to be above his Lord.</p>
                     <p n="1">

Some who pretend to an immediate Divine Call to the Miniſtry, without having any ſufficient Evidence to prove it; I am ſenſible will object here, that only true Chriſtians are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of judging of this Evidence. But this is only a trifling Sophiſm, by which they deceive themſelves, and impoſe on ſome well meaning Perſons; but does not at all remove the Aſurdity.</p>
                     <p>The Miniſters of Chriſt are ſent to preach the Goſpel to all Nations, to every Creature, <hi>that is,</hi> to every Man without Exception; and conſequently, to unconverted Sinners, as well as to Saints. This may be further proved from Sinner's being blamed, ſharply reproved, yea threatened with ſevere Puniſhments, for rejecting the Miniſters of Chriſt. This plainly ſuppoſes that God has given Mankind ſome Evidence, by examining which they may know who are the Miniſters of Chriſt, ſince it would be apparently unjuſt to puniſh Men for diſregarding them, if they can't poſſibly know them? There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt be allowed, that Mankind, notwithſtanding that moral Depravity which they derive from our firſt Parents, can examine and judge whether Miniſters have a divine Call.</p>
                     <p>This is very plain from that pointed Addreſs of our Bleſſed Saviour to the Jews, <note n="a" place="bottom">Luke xii. 54 —57.</note> 
                        <q>When ye ſee a Clould riſe out of the Weſt, ſtraitway ye ſay, there cometh a Shower, and ſo it is. And when ye ſee the South Wind blow, ye ſay, there will be Heat, and it cometh to paſs.

                     </p>
                     <p>Nothing can be plainer than that our Lord takes it for granted in theſe Words, that the unbelieving Jews, though they were as deeply involved in original Sin as others; and more obſtinate and hardened in their own Sins than moſt, were notwithſtanding endowed with ſuch Faculties as render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them capable of judging of the Evidences of his divine Miſſion, which he exhibited before them; as alſo that the Evidences which he produced to ſupport his Pretenſions to an immediate Call from God were ſuch, as would actually have convinced any rational Perſon, whether Saint or Sinner, who ſhould candidly examine them.

His own Interpretation is <q>That by what is right our Saviour meant what is true; for his Diſcourſe in this Place turns upon examining, judging and inferring one Thing from another.</q> P. 5. Now there may be Truths in the Head, which have but little Influence on the Heart and Practice. Were it true then, as it is not, that Sinners in their preſent State could regenerate themſelves, and practice all ſincere Holineſs, and make themſelves meet to be partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in Light, without any ſupernatural Influences of the Spirit: this Paſſage, which is granted to refer to right Opinions or true Judgments and not to Practice, could not be adduced with any Propriety to prove that Poſition.</p>
                           <p>The Doctor ſeems to have been ſenſible <q>That Men are not much diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to exert their Faculties but to receive very implicitly the Opinions of their good Fathers and good Mothers—yea that no Notion is ſo abſurd but ſome are abſurd enough to propagate and others to believe it; eſpecially if it be ſuch an one as ſtrikes at the Root of all Religion and every Thing wherein the Happineſs of Mankind conſiſts.</q> Now is not an Indiſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to love and ſeek after Truth, and a Proneneſs to embrace the moſt abſurd and pernicious Errors a very evil and hateful Quality? Whence does ſuch a Wrongneſs of Temper ariſe? He has granted the Fact to be ſo, and he is as much obliged to account for the Phaenomenon as the Calviniſts.</p>
                           <p>Though Men in their natural State can judge in ſome Meaſure of Truth and Falſhood, Right and Wrong, and by examining the Evidences with which the Scriptures are recommended muſt be convinced they are true, yet they are repreſented in theſe ſacred Writings to be in a State of Ignorance, Da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </q> The Gentiles being more wicked and debaugched, are frequently ſpoken of as being more in Darkneſs than the Jews. And thus all Mankind both Jews and Gentiles, while they remain unregenerate and in Unbelief are repreſented in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, as ignorant and blind, notwithſtanding their being endowed with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities to judge of Truth and Falſhood, Right and Wrong.

                           <p>But it is currently reported that the Doctor is become more orthodox in theſe Points. — In his Sermons on ſtriving to enter in at the ſtrait Gate, he ſeems to allow <q>That Mankind are not to be conſidered in a State of Innocency at preſent, but apoſtate, degenerate and guilty Creatures, juſtly obnoxious to the Wrath of God—That the very Foundation of the Goſpel is laid in, and the whole ſuperſtructure of it built upon the ſuppoſition that Mankind in general are in ſuch a State of Condemnation and Ruin.</q> P. 11. And he ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> likewiſe to grant <q>The Neceſſity of the Illuminations of the Holy Spirit—for a new Heart, and right Spirit.—And lays it is generally if not univerſally agreed amongſt profeſſed Chriſtians, that Repentance unto Life, and evangelical Holineſs are not attainable without the gracious Operations of the Holy Spirit; and conſequently that without theſe divine Influences all the Endeavours of Sinners to attain Holineſs and ſo to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life muſt be ineffectual. Which indeed amounts to neither more nor leſs than what our Lord himſelf declares—That except a Man be born again he cannot ſee the Kingdom of God.</q> &amp;c. Had he diſcovered this ſooner might not ſome of his Banter have been ſpared? But it is agreeable to ſee how he grows wiſer as he grows older.</p>
                           <p>The Opinion which he endeavours to eſtabliſh in theſe two laſt Sermons, perhaps in Brief is this, <q>That though Mankind are now in a degenerate State, yet God for the Sake of Chriſt has granted the Influences of his Spirit equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to all who live under the Goſpel; and that they having rational Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties may ſo ſtrive for Grace and Salvation as actually to obtain the ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Favour of God, in Conſequence of their ſuitable Improvement of theſe general Influences, and their earneſt Strivings, God having eſtabliſhed a Connexion between this Beſtowment of his ſpecial Grace and ſuch ſincere Endeavours of unregenerate Sinners as the Doctor has diſcribed: And that unregenerate Sinners having theſe general Aids, Awakenings of the Spirit, &amp;c. not only may, but many of them actually do thus ſtrive; ſo that ſuch as are actually converted and ſaved, do in Fact become Partakers of this Grace and Salvation, in Conſequence of their having previouſly ſtrove and improved the religious Advantages, which God beſtowed upon them in common with thoſe who live under the Goſpel, better than others; and that all, who do not thus firſt ſtrive for Salvation, and make this better Improvement of their common Advantages, muſt neceſſarily fall of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration here and the Kingdom of Heaven hereafter</q>

                     <p>Was not Nicodemus a Stranger to Regeneration when he came to Jeſus by Night? yet even then he could ſay <q>Rabbi, we know that thou art a Teacher come from God; for no Man can do theſe Miracles that thou doeſt, except God be with him.</q> Thus Chriſt gave Evidence that was ſufficient in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to convince Sinners as well as Saints, if they had candidly attended to it. Chriſt bore this Evidence not only to himſelf but alſo to his Apoſtles, yea to all whom he ever called in an immediate Manner to preach his Goſpel.</p>
                     <p>To ſay that only true Chriſtians can judge of the immediate Call of Miniſters is to open the Doors to all Sorts of Impoſtors who honoring their Followers with this high Character will avail themſelves of this Pretence. When they are oppoſed, they can eaſily ſay their Oppoſers are blind and unconverted and ſo can't judge of their Pretenſions, whereas true Chriſtians know and acknowledge their Call. Now by true Chriſtians they mean their own Followers and fond Admirers. Thus they wreſt themſelves out of the Hands of indifferent, impartial Judges, and appeal to thoſe they know are ſtrongly prejudiced in their Favour. It would be ſtrange indeed, if their own Admirers ſhould not ſtrongly witneſs for them. This is a fine Way to be tried, when they themſelves are both Judge and Party. How can a Deceiver be detected on this Plan, which takes his bold Say ſo for Proof? And allows him to bear Witneſs of himſelf, that God has immediately called him, in direct Oppoſition both to Scripture and Reaſon?</p>
                     <p>In fine, God has been pleaſed to give ſundry plain Intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in his Word, that he would raiſe up and qualify Men for the Miniſtry; and call them to it; not in an extraordinary Manner as he did the Apoſtles, but in a common, ordinary Way. Hence the Apoſtle Paul gave various Directions to Timothy and Titus, and conſequently to the Miniſters of Chriſt in all Ages how to proceed in putting Men into the Miniſtry. Theſe Directions plainly prove, that God determined to call Miniſters to ſupply his Churches in the common, ordinary Way. For there would be no Room to follow them, to examine and
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:009120_0080_1030F620DF247538"/>
judge, approve or reject Candidates for the Miniſtry, if God called them to it in an immediate Manner. They who come into the Miniſtry according to theſe Directions have the Call of God agreeable to the ſtated Rules of the Word.</p>
                     <p>Now ſince God has appointed a Method for the ſupply of his Churches, we may argue from his Wiſdom, that he will not recede from it unleſs on ſome very extraordinary Occaſion. When he does, he will undoubtedly give ſufficient Evidence, that he has altered the old and ſet up a new Plan. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſuch Alterations have always been introduced by Miracles, we act ſafely in adhering to the ſtated Rules delivered in the New-Teſtament, in calling Men to the Miniſtry, till thoſe, who reject them, and plead for an immediate Call, work Miracles to prove that God has repealed theſe Rules; and that their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for an immediate Call, are not mere Fancies or immediate Deluſions.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. Barclay <note n="c" place="bottom">See his Apology; P. 296.</note> objects againſt this Argument, that John the Baptiſt wrought no Miracles. To which it may be eaſily anſwered, that the Call of this eminent Perſon, before he was born, was confirmed by very public and ſtriking Miracles, as is evident from the firſt Chapter of Luke's Goſpel. Beſides as John the Baptiſt was the Son of Zacherias, who was a Prieſt; he had a common and ordinary Call to be a Teacher to the People, according to the ſtated Cuſtoms of that Diſpenſation. So that John the Baptiſt had both a common and extraordinary Call, which laſt was confirmed by Miracles. As this Writer has pitched on no other particular Inſtance of any Perſon, who was immediately called, and no Miracles wrought to prove his Call was from God; it ſhould ſeem he was exceedingly pinched by this Argument. 'Tis greatly probable his not knowing how to anſwer it was the true Reaſon, he ſtudied ſo much Brevity here, when he is ſo very lengthy almoſt every where elſe.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Some pretend to evade the Force of the foregoing Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning againſt their immediate divine Call, by alledging, that Sinners are convinced, and converted, and Saints edified by their Miniſtry, which is a great Miracle, and therefore accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my Principles a ſufficient Proof of their immediate Call.</p>
                     <p>

Were theſe the Miracles which Moſes wrought to prove that God immediately ſent him to bring the Children of Iſrael out of Egypt? What Sort of Miracles did Chriſt and his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles work to prove that God immediately ſent them?</p>
                     <p>To appeal to the Converſion of Sinners, and the Edification of Saints, as a Miracle to prove your immediate Call, is in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality to appeal to your own Party, whether you are in the right; ſince thoſe Sinners, that are imagined to be converted, and the Saints ſuppoſed to be edified, are all your own Followers. It would be ſtrange indeed if they would not bear Witneſs for their Ring Leaders. This could be only an Evidence to thoſe Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners who were convinced, and the Saints that were edified, who moſt certainly are but very few. Whereas, when God ſends any Miniſter, he ſends him to all Sorts, to Sinners as well as Saints, to the lukewarm and ſecure, the careleſs and prophane; and conſequently the Evidence of his Divine Call is ſuch, as they, even they, can judge upon, at leaſt in ſome Meaſure.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. But does not the Apoſtle Paul appeal to the Succeſs of his Miniſtry, as the grand Proof of his immediate Call to the Apoſtleſhip, when he ſays, <note n="d" place="bottom">1 Cor ix. 2, 3.</note> 
                        <q>Am I not an Apoſtle? Am I not free? Have I not ſeen Jeſus Chriſt our Lord? Are not you my Work in the Lord? If I be not an Apoſtle unto others, yet doubtleſs I am to you, for the Seal of mine Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleſhip are ye in the Lord.</q>

                     <p>Anſ.

                        <q>I ought to have been commended of you, for in Nothing am I behind the very chiefeſt Apoſtles.

                     <p>If you would cloſely examine the Paſſage, you might ſee that he firſt appeals to his miraculous Call to prove he was an Apoſtle. <q>Am I not an Apoſtle? —Have I not ſeen Jeſus Chriſt our Lord?</q> Thus he appeals to that gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rious Viſion, which he had of Chriſt, when he was going to Damaſcus, which ſtruck him blind, and all who were with him ſpeechleſs; at which Time he was immediately called by a loud Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as the grand Proof of his Apoſtleſhip. This is one of the moſt ſtriking and inconteſtable Miracles that ever was wrought. To this therefore he appeals in the firſt Place. <hi>Have I not ſeen the Lord?</hi> And you ſee from the above quoted Paſſage, 2 Cor. xii. 11, 12. that he appeals to the Signs, Wonders, and mighty Deeds, the glorious Miracles he had wrought before their own Eyes, as the grand Proof of his being an Apoſtle. So that their Converſion could only be a ſecondary Proof of his Call to be an Apoſtle. It ſhould have been tranſlated, <q>For <hi>a</hi> Seal of mine Apoſtleſhip are ye in the Lord,</q> not <hi>the</hi> Seal, as all who are acquainted with the Original, know it would properly bear.</p>
                     <p>Paul was immediately called to be an Apoſtle, before he had ever preached the Goſpel at all. But to ſuppoſe he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted any by Preaching, before he had preached, is to ſuppoſe a manifeſt Contradiction. So that the Succeſs which the Lord gave to his Miniſtry could not be the Evidence or Proof that he called him to this Office. The Succeſs of his Miniſtry was not the Proof of his immediate Call, but it was a Proof and Evidence, that the Lord owned him in this Office. All there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that can be inferred from this Text is, that the Succeſs of a Miniſter, who has firſt given ſufficient Proof, that God has immediately called him, is an Evidence that God bleſſes the Truths which he delivers. This in Conjunction with other valid Proofs may corroborate the Evidence, and be a Seal to his Miniſtry; but is by no Means to be looked on as a ſufficient Evidence of itſelf.

But ſince the evident and direct Tendency of their Teaching is to draw People from attending where the Goſpel is abundantly better preached, than they with any Reaſon can pretend; to fill their Minds with Prejudices, and lead them into dangerous Errors; I muſt be excuſed from countenancing them in their Conduct. However if in any Inſtance God has been pleaſed to overrule and bleſs any of their Exhortations, for real good to any, which has I believe very rarely happened in this Country, I ſincerely rejoice in this, and give Glory to God, who ſometimes accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies by his Power Means that are the moſt unſuitable in themſelves.

your Cauſe might be improved againſt you. For the ſtanding Miniſters are regularly called, and ſet apart according to divine Appointment, to the Work of the Miniſtry, and therefore have the ordinary Call of God agreeable to the ſtated Rules of his Word. God has been pleaſed to own them in their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, making them Inſtruments of converting Sinners, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Saints. You muſt acknowledge this, ſince many of you have declared that you were converted in the ſtanding Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es before you ſeparated.</p>
                     <p>Upon your own Principles then, we can ſay to ſundry of you, <hi>Are not you our Work in the Lord? If we be not Apoſtles to others, yet doubtleſs we are to you: For a Seal of our Miniſtry are ye in the Lord.</hi> And to this Day, bleſſed be God, there are ſome hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inſtances of Converſion among us, in which we are impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as the Inſtruments. So that Chriſt has not forſaken us. He bleſſeſs the Word preached in the ſtanding Churches both to Saints and Sinners, notwithſtanding all the Pains you have taken to prejudice Men's Minds againſt our Perſons and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. Now if the Miniſters in the ſtanding Churches were, as you confeſs, once true Miniſters of Chriſt, and owned by him as ſuch, are we not ſo ſtill? Eſpecially ſince we ſtill maintain the ſame Religion both in Principle and Practice as formerly? Since it is certain from Chriſt's Promiſe, and the ſenſible Effects of his Preſence and Spirit in ſundry Inſtances, that he has not forſaken the ſtanding Churches how dare you? Speak out plain i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> you think that Chriſt's Miniſters have fallen from Grace. But if you pretend to an immediate Call, then work Miracles to prove that your Call is from God, and not from the Devil. You are obliged to work Miracles to ſupport your extraordinary Pretenſions or elſe give them up. Conſider this at your Leiſure, and remember that a thouſand Aſſertions, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the ſtrongeſt Terms and expreſſed with the greateſt Zeal don't amount to one good Proof. You may depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it that ſolid Proof and not confident Aſſertions will be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. If God has really given your Teachers an immediate Call he will doubtleſs work Miracles to prove it, ſince their Credit with all judicious People neceſſarily requires this incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible Evidence, and God is ſtill the ſame, and therefore as able to give this Evidence now as in former Ages.</p>

                     <p>Anſ. This I ſuppoſe is one of the many Scriptures which you quote for the Sake of the Sound, ſince in its true Senſe it is evidently Nothing to your Purpoſe, as will preſently appear.</p>
                     <p>The Apoſtle is here diſcourſing of the High-Prieſthood among the Jews, which Office he ſays, as they knew from the Law of Moſes, no Man had a Right to but he that was called of God, as Aaron and his Poſterity were. Now what can this Paſſage which has no Reference at all to the Goſpel-Miniſtry prove about it? But if I ſhould, for Argument's Sake, grant that this Text referred to the Goſpel-Miniſtry, what would you infer from it? That Goſpel-Miniſters ſhould be called under the New-Teſtament as the high Prieſts were under the Old? Then it would follow that Miniſters ſhould not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately called themſelves, but by ſome other. For Aaron was called by Moſes according as the Lord commanded him. Then alſo none ſhould preſume to officiate as Miniſters of the Goſpel, but Miniſter's Sons. For none might be High-Prieſts under the Law, but the Sons and lineal Deſcendants of Aaron.</p>
                     <p>Once more, when God called any Perſons in an immediate Way, he gave them Qualifications with his Call, ſo that they were well fitted for the Miniſtry. Thus the Prophets of Old. Thus alſo St. Paul and the Apoſtles. Hence, it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, that if you were really called of God, you would be eminently fitted to preach the Goſpel. But this is not the Caſe with you.</p>
                     <p>Here I dare appeal to ſundry who have occaſionally attended your Meetings. Let me aſk ſuch, are not the Diſcourſes of theſe Exhorters very mean and deſpicable; without Senſe as well as Connexion? Is not the Vehemency of the Speakers almoſt the only Thing that recommends their Exhortations? How unlike are their Exhortations to the ſolid, weighty Diſcourſes of the Prophets and Apoſtles, though they pretend to the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Divine Commiſſion, and the ſame extraordinary Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? What plainer Proof can there be of the Vanity of their Pretenſions?—I wiſh ſome ready Writer would take down one of their Exhortations or Preachments as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver it, and publiſh it to the World, that their Admirers might ſee what it is they are carried away with, and that

they themſelves might learn a little more Modeſty, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear meddling with Matters that are too high for them.— The Goſpel is not mere vehement Noiſe and Bawling.</p>
                     <p>It is in vain for theſe Teachers to plead the Example of the Apoſtles, for their own Ignorance and Want of Learning. The Apoſtles were ſome conſiderable Time under the Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Jeſus Chriſt. They underſtood the Goſpel to great exactneſs, and had a thorough Acquaintance with the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. They ſpoke with Propriety on every Subject they had Occaſion to handle. Whether their Abilities were natural, acquired, or communicated in an extraordinary Manner; certain it is, they wrote with ſo much Correctneſs and good Senſe, as but few learned Men can equal.</p>
                     <p>Our Tranſlation calling them <hi>ignorant Men.</hi> Acts iv. 13. is very unhappy, ſince the original Words lit-rally ſignify only this, that they were <hi>not S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Stream of Prejudice againſt the Capacities of old Women, ſince the Time of the Apoſtle, has been ſo great and general in the World, that moſt Men, I believe, if they were to chuſe, had rather have one young Woman than three old ones.

How far they are under the immediate powerful Influence of an evil Spirit in every In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as it is not neceſſary, ſo perhaps would not be eaſy to determine.

a Church. But God has ſo plainly and expreſsly forbidden them in his Word, that all, who have any due Regard to the Scriptures in this Particular, muſt be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from this ſtrange Practice, by ſeriouſly and candidly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the following Paſſages. <note n="l" place="bottom">1 Cor. xiv 34 — 38. 1 Tim. ii. 9 — 15.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>Let the Women keep Silence with all Subjection: But I ſuffer not a Woman to teach nor to uſurp Authority over the Man, but to be in Silence; For Adam was firſt formed, then Eve; And Adam was not deceived, but the Woman being deceived was in the Tranſgreſſion.—Let your Women keep Silence in the Churches, For it is not permitted to them to ſpeak, but they are commanded to be under Subjection, as alſo faith the Law. And if they will learn any Thing, let them aſk their Huſbands at Home.— For it is a Shame for Women to ſpeak in the Church.— What! Came the Word out from you, or came it unto you only? If any Man think himſelf to be a Prophet or Spiritual, let him acknowledge that the Things which I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord: But if any Man be ignorant, let him be ignorant.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus Women are expreſsly commanded to keep Silence in all Churches while they are aſſembled for religious Worſhip. So that publick praying as well as exhorting and preaching are forbidden here.</p>
                     <p>But does not the Apoſtle Paul write thus in another Epiſtle, <q>I intreat thee alſo true Yoke-Fellow, help thoſe Women which laboured with me in the Goſpel</q>

                     </p>
                     <p>Anſ. It does not appear from theſe Words that Women either preached, exhorted, or prayed publickly. For there were other Labours in the Goſpel, in which they might be employed. We may learn from the Apoſtle himſelf, what Labours Women performed for the Service of the Church and Goſpel, according to the Cuſtoms of that Time. <note n="n" place="bottom">1 Tim. v. 9<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10.</note> — <q>Let not a Widow be taken into the Number under three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore Years old, having been the Wife of one Man; well reported of for good Works; if ſhe have brought up Children, if ſhe have lodged Strangers, if ſhe have waſhed the Saints Feet, if ſhe have relieved the Afflicted, if ſhe
<pb facs="unknown:009120_0085_1030F62E54CDB6D0"/>
have diligently followed every good Work.</q> Here the Apoſtle had an Occaſion to enumerate the various Services and Labours of Women. It was thus they laboured in the Goſpel, if we will grant the Apoſtle that common Piece of Juſtice, to be his own Interpreter. Peruſe this Paſſage leiſurely. Does he mention Women's public Praying or Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting in this minute Enumeration of their Labours and Services in the Goſpel?</p>
                     <p>This Interpretation, which I have given, fairly reconciles theſe ſeveral Paſſages of the Apoſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>'s Writings. But accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you he ſtatly contradicts himſelf, which, if you could make out, inſtead of confirming, your Practice would deſtroy the Authority of the Apoſtle, ſince Contradictions could never proceed from divine Inſpiration.</p>
                     <p>Let none of your Adherents excuſe themſelves here, and try to wave the Matter of your Womens ſpeaking in your pretended Churches, by profeſſing not to underſtand this particular Part of your Conduct. For it is as plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Scriptures for Women to ſpeak or carry on in any Aſſembly met for religious Worſhip, as any Thing can poſſibly be. You can't but ſee this, unleſs you wilfully ſhut your Eyes, or are judicially blinded. When Hannah prayed ſhe ſpake in her Heart, only her Lips moved, but her Voice was not heard.</p>
                     <p>You ſhould not venture to diſregard any of the Commands of the great God. Our bleſſed Lord bears this Teſtimony, <q>Verily I ſay unto you, till Heaven and Earth paſs, one Jot or one Title ſhall in no wiſe paſs from the Law, till all be fulfilled.

                     <p>To illuſtrate and confirm ſundry Things which have been ſaid, I ſhall now ſubjoin a brief Account of ſome of the more remarkable Inſtances of Satan's deceiving and impoſing upon Mankind.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, and indeed the moſt remarkable Inſtance of Satan's Power and Subtilty, in managing his Temptations, was that of his deceiving Eye in the Shape of the Serpent. <q>Now the Serpent was more ſubtil than any Beaſt of the Field which the Lord God had made; and he ſaid unto the Woman, yea, hath God ſaid ye ſhall not eat of every Tree of the Garden? And the Woman ſaid unto the Serpent, We may eat of the Fruit of the Trees of the Garden; but of the Tree which is in the midſt of the Garden, God hath ſaid, ye ſhall not eat of it, neither ſhall ye touch it, leſt ye die. And the Serpent ſaid unto the Woman, ye ſhall not ſurely die. For God doth know, that in the Day ye eat there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of then your Eyes ſhall be opened; and ye ſhall be as Gods, knowing Good and Evil.</q> &amp;c. Was not the Power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in managing this, Temptation very great, when he put Words into the Mouth of the Serpent or Snake, a Creature that is by Nature dumb, and thus begun and carried on a Converſation with the Woman? It is worthy to be remarked that he managed this firſt Temptation by bringing a new Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, <hi>different from, and contrary to</hi> that which God himſelf had expreſsly revealed. But it was a Revelation that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed them great Things. <q>Ye ſhall not ſurely die—Ye ſhall be as Gods.</q> And Satan to this Day, when he tempts Men to Sin often and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Saul's Propheſying 1 Sam. xviii. 10. was by the Influence of the evil Spirit; and this muſt of Neceſſity be underſtood of ſuch a Kind of Action and Speaking, as the true Prophets of the Lord uſually expreſſed under the Influence of the bleſſed Spirit; for from the Likeneſs of the Action in both, muſt the Name be bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed.

                     <p>MUNCER was a great Pretender to Revelations, ſome of which were printed.

He wore a Crown of Gold on his Head, and his Titles were the King of Juſtice, the King of the new Jeruſalem. When this great Monarch went abroad he had always two Harbengers before him, of whom one carried a Sword, and the other a Bible. All who did not fall down and worſhip him were ſentenced to die, and immediately executed. He cauſed one of his Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines to be put to Death for deſpiſing his pretended Inſpirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. He ſpirited up the Citizens to make a moſt reſolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, aſſuring them all the while of a miraculous Deliverance. And ſo ſtrong was the Infatuation, that tho' Multitudes of them were daily deſtroyed, they held out till they had ſuffered almoſt as much as the Jews did, when Jeruſalem was taken by Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſian. The town was taken at laſt, and the mock King with his two principal Aſſociates were ſent in Deriſion about the Country. He was afterwards put to Death by having his Fleſh torn off with red hot Pincers.

                     <p>That was a very remarkable Impulſe, which Lord HERBERT of Cherbury, the firſt noted Deiſtical Writer, was led by to publiſh his Book againſt the Chriſtian Religion, as revealed in the Scriptures. <note n="¶" place="bottom">See Dr. Leland's View of Deiſtical Writers, Let. 2.</note> As the Frame of his whole Book was ſo different from what had ever been written on the Subject, and he apprehended he ſhould meet with much Oppoſition, he did conſider, whether it were not better for him for a while to ſuppreſs it.</p>

thou eternal God, Author of this Light which now ſhines upon me, and Giver of all inward Illuminations; I do beſeech thee, of thine infinite Goodneſs, to pardon a greater Requeſt than a Sinner ought to make: I am not ſatisfied enough, whether I ſhall publiſh this Book: if it be for thy Glory: I beſeech thee give me ſome Sign from Heaven; if not I ſhall ſuppreſs it.</hi> I had no ſooner ſpoken theſe Words, but a loud, though yet gentle Noiſe, came forth from the Heavens (for it was like Nothing on Earth) which did ſo cheer and comfort me, that I took my Petition as granted, and that I had the Sign I demanded; whereupon alſo I reſolved to print my Book. This, how ſtrange ſoever it may ſeem, I proteſt, before the eternal God is true: Neither am I any Way ſuperſtitiouſly deceived here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; ſince I did not only clearly hear the Noiſe, but in the ſereneſt Sky that ever I ſaw, being without a Cloud, did, to my thinking, ſee the Place from whence it came.</q>

Sign from Heaven to determine him. This ſeems to be putting it on a wrong Foot, ſince God hath not in his Word given us any Ground to expect that he will anſwer ſuch a Requeſt; nor is there any Reaſon to expect it from the Nature of the Thing.—I believe it will be acknowledged that ſudden Impreſſions or ſuppoſed Signs from Heaven, like that upon which Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> ſeemeth to lay ſo great Streſs, are very equivocal, and not much to be depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for Information in Truth or Direction in Duty. They may lay Perſons open to Miſtake and Deluſion. It cannot be denied that in ſuch Caſes Men are in Danger of being impoſed upon by the Warmth of their own Imaginations eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if they be wrought up to a ſtrong Deſire and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of an extraordinary Sign from Heaven, in Favour of a Deſign which they heartily wiſh ſhould ſucceed.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since I have found ſome Perſons who have diſcovered a great Regard for ſuch Signs or Tokens, I will add that whatever might be ſaid to excuſe Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> who did not pretend to believe the Holy Scriptures, in his following this Sign, it muſt certainly be very abſurd for Chriſtians, who profeſs to believe that the Scriptures are a perfect Rule, to look for ſuch Tokens. When they are at a Loſs about what is their Duty, why don't they diligently ſearch the Scriptures and aſk the Advice of ſuch as are prudent? If they don't ſearch the Scriptures is not this to treat them with Neglect?</p>
                     <p>It is true, that God ſometimes gave Intimations of his Will under the Old Teſtament by Signs or Tokens. But it was thoſe whom he favoured with immediate Revelations, as the Prophets, &amp;c. to whom he gave ſuch Signs, and that on extraordinary Occaſions. Others were to enquire the Word of the Lord from the Prophets, and to conſult the divine Law and Teſtimony. Where God gave no Intimations, that he would grant them Signs, it was unwarrantable to look for them. They had no Right to demand Signs. Chriſt would not gratify the captious Phariſees when they demanded a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Sign from Heaven, but referred them to what the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures had declared. And ſo on another Occaſion, <q>they have, Moſes and the Prophets let them hear them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whatever God was pleaſed to grant to his People, while Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were raiſed up from Time to Time, this can afford no
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:009120_0091_1030F3388218BE40"/>
Warrant at all to us now after the Scriptures are fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted, to expect Signs from Heaven. It ſhould be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that <q>God who at ſundry Times and in divers Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ſpake in Time paſt unto the Fathers by the Prophets hath in theſe laſt Days ſpoken unto us by his Son.</q> Hence the former Methods or immediate Revelations by ſucceſſive Prophets, Dreams, Viſions, Signs, Tokens are not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected: God has revealed his whole Will which he deſigned to communicate to his Church <hi>at once,</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles. After this one Seaſon, no further immediate Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were to be granted. Such Methods are laid aſide. This is evidently implied in the Text. The Antitheſis plainly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it. Since the Canon of Scripture is thus fully compleated, there is no Need of ſuch Revelations, Signs and Tokens. Conſequently it muſt be vain Preſumption for any to expect them. To follow ſuch Signs is to follow Deluſions.</p>
                     <p>Such a Notion would give cunning Impoſtors a great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to contrive Schemes before Hand, and thus to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſimple and unwary. And who would engage that they would not knowingly and wittingly attempt to deceive; when it is certain Wondermongers have been detected in a thouſand Inſtances of pious Fraud among Heathens and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts? And who can tell what ſtrange and to us unaccountable Signs, "the Prince of the Power of the Air" may if permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted give to thoſe who truſt to ſuch Things. If there was any Thing more in the Sign upon which Lord <hi>Herbert</hi> publiſhed his Book againſt the Scriptures; or in that upon which the <hi>Dutartres</hi> acted than imagination, I leave it to all ſober Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians to ſay whence it came. And ſince Satan would be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to deceive if any Streſs was laid on uncertain, doubtful Signs, it is certainly neceſſary that proper Miracles be wrought to diſtinguiſh the true from the falſe, and to prove that ſuch a Sign comes from God and not from the Devil; otherwiſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may, as appears from the Inſtances of the Dutartres, be led to commit the moſt ſhocking Crimes, while they follow ſuch Signs and Tokens.</p>
                     <p>This ſurprizing Incident of Lord <hi>Herbert,</hi> this immediate Anſwer which he imagined he received to his Prayer, may ſerve as a Caution and Warning to Chriſtians againſt making Requeſts to God for immediate Directions by ſuch Signs, and
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:009120_0091_1030F3388218BE40"/>
prevent them from following what they might perhaps imagine an expreſs Imitation from Heaven in immediate Anſwers to their Prayers.</p>
                     <p>The moſt extraordinary Inſtance of Enthuſiaſm I have met with in Modern Times, is that of the French Prophets. From June 1688, to the End of February following there aroſe in <hi>Dauphiny,</hi> and then in <hi>Vivarais,</hi> five or ſix hundred Proteſtants of both Sexes, who gave out that they were Prophets inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt. As Mankind are apt to be taken with Novelty, and the injudicious to be fond of Extraordinaries, they ſoon became very numerous. The Burden of their Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and Prophecies was, <hi>Amend your Lives, repent ye, the End of all Things draws nigh.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Account which Mr. John Lacy has written of them, who was afterwards himſelf the chief of the Engliſh Prophets that was ſeized with the ſame Spirit, and which he ſays was verified upon Oath and other Proofs, is very wonderful. I ſhall mention but a few Inſtances referring the inquiſitive Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the <note n="†" place="bottom">See his Cry to the Deſart.</note> Book itſelf.</p>

                        <q>John Vernett, of Bois-Caſtle declared at London, January 14, 1706. That the firſt Perſons he ſaw under Inſpiration were his own Mother, his two Siſters, and a Couſin; that his Mother ſpoke, at the Time of Inſpiration, only <hi>French;</hi> which ſurpriſed him exceedingly,—becauſe ſhe never, before her <hi>Inſpirations</hi> attempted to ſpeak a Word in that Language; nor has ſince to his Knowledge; and he is certain ſhe could not do it. He ſays the ſame of his Siſters, and that they all urged their Hearers to Amendment of Life, and preſt it upon him in particular (who was then a little looſe) to be ſober. He went with two of his Acquaintance, to ſee a Friend of theirs near <hi>Vernoux;</hi> that as they were drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, a Girl came to call her Mother, who was with them, to ſee the Child—They all ran immediately. The Child was <hi>Thirteen</hi> or <hi>Fourteen</hi> Months old, and covered then in the Cradle, and had never <hi>of itſelf</hi> ſpoken a Word, nor could it go alone. When they were come in where it was, the Child <hi>ſpoke diſtinctly</hi> in French, with a Voice ſmall like a Child, but loud enough to be heard all over the Room. It
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:009120_0092_1030F33E651C84D0"/>
exhorted like others in that Condition, to the Work of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. The Room where the Child was had about twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Perſons in it, who were, moſt of them, round the Cradle weeping and praying.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>CLAND ARNASSAN, of <hi>Montel,</hi> declared on the 14th of Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, 1706, among other Things as followeth—<q>In the Houſe of my Father at <hi>Montel,</hi> a Shepherd who look't to my Father's Sheep, named <hi>Peter Bernaut,</hi> ſo ſilly he was next to an Ideot, beſought me ſeveral Times, to carry him to an Aſſembly; which I was afraid to do leſt thro' his Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he ſhould betray thoſe Affairs: Nevertheleſs, one Time I did venture to lead him to an Aſſembly by Night. <hi>Peter</hi> being there I obſerved him to keep upon his Knees, for two Hours together at leaſt; then the Gift ſeized him, he was ſtruck as it were dead: And after ſome Time, had violent Agitations of Body. He returning Home, the Spirit came upon him again, the following Day. At which Time his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily Motions were ſo great, that being on his Back the whole Body leapt from the Ground. We were all afraid he would hurt himſelf upon the Pavement. He continued to batter himſelf in that Manner, that his Hair was as wet with Sweat as if dipt in Water. Two or three Times was he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with theſe violent <hi>Contortions,</hi> without ſpeaking. At length he ſaid, it was for his Sins he had been thus torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. After that, in other Inſpirations he ſpake aloud, quoting appoſitely many Texts of Scripture, and all to preſs us ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to a good Life. As for this Man, I am certain he could not read. He never was at Divine Worſhip but that Time, nor was he capable to be inſtructed by any Perſon whatſoever, to ſpeak the Things he ſaid in his Inſpirations.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>They encreaſed greatly in ſpite of all Oppoſition, and very ſevere Perſecutions, in which many of them were put to Death; ſo that in a few Years there were ſeveral Thouſands of them, from whom, I might, if it were needful, preſent you with Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of the like Nature and Tendency with theſe already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
                     <p>Sometime in the Year 1706, three or four of theſe Prophets came over into England, and brought their prophetic Spirit along with them, which ſoon ſpread among others, ſo that before the Year was out, there were two or three hundred of
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:009120_0092_1030F33E651C84D0"/>
theſe Prophets in and about London of both Sexes, of all Ages, Men, Women and Children; and they had delivered four or five hundred prophetic Warnings.</p>
                     <p>We may have a lively Idea of the Genius of theſe Prophets from the Relation of Mr. <hi>John Lacy,</hi> which he introduces in theſe Words, "I give what follows, which doth particularly concern myſelf, with the ſame Awfulneſs and Appeal to the Searcher of all Hearts, as if I were called by Authority to do it upon Oath."</p>
                     <q>
                        <p>Having from November laſt, to the Beginning of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary following, been preſent divers Times at the Extaſies of Mr. <hi>Marien,</hi> Mr. <hi>Fage,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cavalier;</hi> I can ſay, that their Agitation did never make any Impreſſion on my Mind or Imagination, ſuch as to promote an Imitation of them or even an Inclination to it. For the Space of at leaſt eighteen Days before mine came upon me, I had ſeen none of them; and mine were ſo intirely different from any of theirs, that it is altogether unlikely that the Force of Imagination, as ſome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Conſideration have fancied, could produce them—The firſt Symptoms of the Emotions on my Body ſurprized me in the Inſtant of awaking, on the firſt Day of March;—and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued more or leſs upon me unto the twelfth Day of June, before the Word was put into my Mouth.—I can poſitively ſay, I never once expected or deſired to have them before I was actually ſeized with them: But as they came not of my Will or Deſire, ſo I know they came in Conſequence of my frequent Prayers, that God would guide me aright in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Judgment of that awful Subject of Inſpiration, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Covennes,</hi> whereof I had been then, and for two Months before preparing the Relation.—The bodily Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were gradually increaſing upon me, until the Effect or rather Iſſue of them was produced, viz. <hi>the opening my Mouth to ſpeak.</hi>

                        <p>They began by a preternatural Courſe of Breathing, then my Head came to be agitated or ſhaken violently and forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and with a quick Motion horizontally, or from Side to Side. Then my Stomach had Twitches not much unlike an Hickup; afterwards my Hands and Arms were violently ſhaken; at length a ſtruggle or a Labouring in the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, and ſometimes a Sort of Catching or Twitches all

over my Body; and about a Week before my Speaking, I obſerved my Tongue was now and then moved involunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, as were alſo my Lips, my Mouth, and Jaw ſeverally; all which Preparation of the bodily Organs, I found atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with a conſtant Elevation of Soul to God, the Mind being <hi>unaccountably</hi> caſt into a Frame of <hi>ſpiritual Joy,</hi> holy Contempt of all Things in the World, and inceſſant Prayers far more earneſt and intent than what I had ever found be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore—My ſecret Prayers were inſeparably attended with the Encreaſe of thoſe Symptoms, and during all this Time, I ſearched the Scriptures carefully, for my Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and heedfully conſidered all the Advices given me by my Friends.</p>
                        <p>After ſo much Care and Fear of being deluded, I am the better aſſured, and do affirm without the leaſt Doubt, that my Agitations and Words in the Extaſy are produced by a ſuperior Agent, and are independant of me any further than that I do not, nor dare not oppoſe, but do remain alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether paſſive—My Mind at thoſe Times continues clear and ſedate, during which my Fear and Caution make me wait always, until the Tongue be moved by that ſuperior Power; nor doth any Impulſe alone prevail with me therein: So that it is no longer I, as the Prime voluntary Mover and Agent that ſpeak, and oftentimes I know not the Senſe until the Words are ſpoken, and ſo heard by me as by other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons preſent. Nor did <hi>I myſelf</hi> write thoſe Engliſh Words, which are contained in the Warning of the twelfth of July; but my Fingers were forcibly moved to do it, my Eyes then being ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I have moreover thrice experienced a <hi>Tone</hi> or <hi>Manner</hi> in <hi>the Voice itſelf,</hi> which I am well aſſured, I am no Ways capable of, in my natural State.</p>
                        <p>I have great Reaſon to bleſs God for having had a vertuous Education, and for the Grace he has ſince vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed me never to allow myſelf to live in the Practice of any known Sin; nor deliberately, or preſumptuouſly, to commit any one ſuch Act.—I have therefore the more Confidence that God doth not now deliver me up to ſo horrid a Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as the voluntary ſpeaking of myſelf in his Perſon would

                        <p>As to the Obſervation of the Lord's Day, it has pleaſed God to vouchſafe me his gracious Viſits, more frequently and ſolemnly on thoſe Days than on others. I therefore with Joy and Comfort wait for them: A Voice that comes to me frequently in my Cloſet, as well as before Company (which upon all the Enquiry, Reaſoning, Caution. Fear and Deliberation, that I am capable of) I do firmly believe to be from God; conſequently I dare not diſobey, hide or ſtitle, under the Dread of thereby charging my Conſcience with a I oad of Guilt and Horror unſupportable; although at the ſame Time I am ſenſible what numerous Reproaches, what Loſs, what Difficulties, what Hazzards, what Trouble, what Labour, what Clamours and Contempt, the owning myſelf to be inſpired, has done, doth, and will engage me in—I would not ſurely have unneceſſarily brought myſelf under any of theſe; nor could I now, by my own proper Strength bear up under them. But the inward Joy that I have from the great Comforter, has from the Beginning ſupported me, and I truſt it will continue ſo to do, and make me in his due Time triumphant over all.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>But notwithſtanding all this Seriouſneſs and Confidence, which theſe Prophets diſcovered, it is certain beyond any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Doubt that this Buſineſs of Inſpiration was wholly a S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="168" facs="unknown:009120_0094_1030F3438964A5D8"/>
there had been Nothing beſides the palpable Failuers of their Predictions, this alone would have been ſufficient to convince every Man who believes the Scriptures, that they were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired by God. For this is a Mark which God himſelf has given us in his written Word of a falſe Prophecy. See Deut. xviii. 21, 22. <q>If thou ſay in thine Heart, how ſhall we know the Word which the Lord hath not ſpoken? When a Prophet ſpeaketh in the Name of the Lord, if the Thing follow not, nor come to paſs, that is the Thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As the Lord employs Satan to inflict Vengeance on his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrigible Enemies, as in the Caſe of wicked <hi>Ahab;</hi> and permits him ſometimes to afflict his Saints, as in the Inſtance of <hi>Job;</hi> this Deceiver at Times may have ſome Intimations of the Divine Will about ſome future Events. Beſides Satan is a profound Politician, and has had great Experience in human Affairs, and in many Inſtances may give a very near Gueſs at Things to come. But as he is not endowed with abſolute Knowledge, he may be miſtaken himſelf. And it is very cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he makes it his grand Buſineſs to deceive Mankind. But God knows all Things, paſt, preſent, and to come. Such is his infinite Perfection he cannot be deceived himſelf, nor attempt to lead his Creatures into a Miſtake, by revealing a Falſhood to them. When therefore any Propheſy is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by the Event, this is an infallible Proof, that it did not proceed from God, as is expreſsly aſſerted in the forecited Text.</p>
                     <p>The chief Purport of theſe Prophet's Predictions was to warn the World of the near Approach of the Kingdom of God; and the happy Times of the Church; which were to be uſhered in by terrible Judgments executed on the Wicked, univerſally throughout the World; which were to root out the Tares and leave only good Corn, A PURE CHURCH, upon the Earth; all which was to be manifeſt over the whole World within a ſhort Term of three Years, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

                        </gap> theſe Predictions were uttered, and no ſuch Events have happened. The Term which they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed is long ſince expired, ſo that they have been proved by the Event to have been falſe Prophets.</p>

December 5th, J. L. addreſſed himſelf to the Doctor in theſe Words at his own Houſe, under the Operations of the Spirit. <q>If I command thy Life away, yet I will reſtore it again here even in this Houſe, thou ſhalt return to thy Dwelling again</q>— December 6th, J.

                     </p>
                     <p>After the Doctor was dead and buried, they had ſtill more clear Prophecies of his Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>December 29th, J. C. under the Operation of the Spirit, in an Aſſembly ſpoke in French; to this Purport in Engliſh. <q>My Children, in a few natural Months, you ſhall ſee greater Miracles wrought than I myſelf wrought upon Lazarus— You, and the Inhabitants of this City ſhall, in a few natural Months ſee (Dr. Emes) my faithful Servant, who has been buried, raiſed in the Preſence of Men—He ſhall come out of his Grave, without the Earth being taken away, that lies upon him. He ſhall come forth in the Preſence of Men, and he ſhall untie his Shroud in which he is wrapt. This ſhall not be in Secret, it ſhall be in Public.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>December 29th. The Spirit in J. Potter ſaid, <q>It ſhall be manifeſt, that the raiſing of this Body ſhall be a greater Miracle, than that of your Lord when he raiſed Lazarus. Lazarus lay but four Days, but my Servant ſhall lie much longer in his Grave: Yes, I ſay, more Months than he lay Days. He ſhall be raiſed fat and lovely, ſo that he ſhall captivate the Affections of the Beholders. Bleſſed are ye that believe. Many are hardened by his Death. They have ſuffered themſelves to be captivated by the Devil. Shall they believe in his Reſurrection? I tell you no. Yet <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</hi> and <hi>ten Thouſands</hi> ſhall believe thereby.</q>—</p>

                        </q> There were many other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of the Doctor's Reſurrection equally expreſs with theſe, which to avoid Tediouſneſs I have not inſerted.</p>
                     <p>Theſe Propheſies of the Doctor's Reſurrection, delivered ſo often, with ſuch great particularity, and Confidence; and all under the Agitations and Inſpirations of the Spirit, could not fail to make a great Noiſe in the Nation. Such was the Alarm of this predicted Miracle, that the Queen's Guard was poſted on Bunhillfields on the 25th of May the Day appointed for its being wrought to prevent Diſorders. Twenty thouſand People from one Motive and another aſſembled, and no Doubt many of them with an Expectation of ſeeing the Doctor riſe from his Grave. But there he lies, and will lie, till the Voice of the Arch-Angel at the laſt Day ſhall awake the Dead and ſummon them to Judgment. Nothing remarkable happened on that noted 25th of May at Bunhillfields; only the vaſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of People, and ſuch a woful Diſappointment to theſe Prophets, as brought them, with <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Prophets of old when

There plainly appears an Honeſty in their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and no Doubt there was Something very extraordinary in this Scene which they acted, though they might as is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to Mankind, endeavour to repreſent their Cauſe to the beſt Advantage, and thus perhaps embelliſh ſome Things beyond the Truth.</p>
                     <p>As to their ſpeaking in Languages which they had never learned, it is to be obſerved, that they only ſpoke in ſuch Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, when they were under the forcible Agitations of their Spirit. They had, as appears from their own Accounts, no more Skill in thoſe Languages afterwards, than before. This then was not the Gift of Tongues which the Divine Spirit gave to the Apoſtles, and ſome of the firſt Converts to Chriſtianity. It was a diſtant, and but a diſtant Imitation of it—This was not ſo wonderful as for Satan to cauſe the Serpent to ſpeak, that is by Nature dumb. And it ſeems that, like the Serpent, they ſpake as they were impelled, their ſpeaking Organs being forcibly moved by that Agent for whoſe Motions they waited.</p>
                     <p>Had they ſteadfaſtly adhered to the written Word of God, and not looked for any Revelations but thoſe contained in the Bible, Satan would not have found an Opportunity of befool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in ſuch a prodigious Manner. But where Men will look for Extraordinaries, when they will run after Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, they may thank themſelves, if Satan lends them ſometimes a helping Hand, and holds forth a falſe Light to thoſe who are ſo very willing to follow him.</p>
                     <p>When the French Prophets were overruled by divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to bring their Prophecies, Revelations, &amp;c. to be tried by the right Teſt, that is, by genuine, public Miracles, they ſoon diſcovered their Deluſions. Some of the Ancient Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:009120_0096_1030F3488873E120"/>
and many among the Superſtitious Papiſts have pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Miracles have been wrought in Proof of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. But they were <hi>ſecret</hi> Miracles, ſome of them like Tranſubſtantiation were always ſo inviſible, that they could never be ſeen but by Hearſay. And others of them were never heard of till many Years after they are ſaid to have been wrought. If the Popiſh Wonders were not mere Impoſture, why were they not wrought before ſome of their underſtanding Oppoſers among Proteſtants, as well as before their own ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Bigots, and fond Admirers? Chriſt wrought his Miracles before his moſt cunning and fierceſt Oppoſers as well as before his own Diſciples and dear Friends. His Enemies themſelves could not but own that he and his Diſciples wro't many glorious Miracles. The Jews confeſſed this. Julian, the learned and malicious Apoſtate, confeſſed this. Theſe Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles were wrought ſo publickly that they could not deny them. But the pretended Wonders of Papiſts and Enthuſiaſts have been often detected, and clearly diſcovered to be No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the artful Inventions of cunning Deceivers, to blind the ignorant and credulous, to raiſe the Credit, and encreaſe the Number of their Party, or to wheedle them the more eaſily out of their Money; or elſe they are ſome ſtrange Appearances pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the Power and Subtilty of Satan. Such are theſe famous ſecret Wonders. They are therefore called <hi>lying Wonders</hi> with the greateſt Propriety, in the Scriptures. But let us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inſiſt upon public Miracles. This is an infallible Teſt which will always demonſtrate the Truth of divine Revelation, to the Confuſion of Deceivers, and clearly diſtinguiſh it from, all Counterfeits. Let Men produce the Evidence of proper Miracles, ſuch as raiſing the Dead, &amp;c. to recommend their new Revelations, or let them not pretend to be inſpired.</p>
                     <p>There muſt be ſome Mark or Character by which we may diſtinguiſh divine Revelation from ſuch as are falſe and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary. For it appears to be no new Thing for Men to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they are under the immediate Direction of God and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive divine Inſtructions from Heaven. The Authors and Ring-leaders of new Sects have generally made this Pretence. It was ſo in the Heathen as well as in the Chriſtian World. When <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> introduced the ancient Romiſh Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition he pretended to be directed in all he did by the Goddeſs
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:009120_0096_1030F3488873E120"/>
                        <hi>Egeria.</hi> Triptolemus, to recommend his Laws to the Atheni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, gave out that he was inſpired by <hi>Ceres.</hi> Licurgus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to act by the Direction of the God, Apollo, when he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated his extraordinary Laws to the Spartans. And it was common throughout the Heathen World, when any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Change was to be made, or any important Enterpriſe to be undertaken, for ſome of thoſe who favoured it, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſome new Revelation or Oracle in Support of their Opinion. Now though there is the moſt undeniable Evidence to prove that many of their Revelations and Anſwers of their Oracles were Nothing but the Contrivance of crafty Knaves, downright Cheat and Impoſture; yet for any Thing I have ever ſeen proved, ſome of their oracular Reſponſes might be ſupernatural, from the immediate Agency of the Devil The Fathers, who had much better Opportunities to be acquainted with the Revelations of the Heathens, than we, as they lived, ſome of them at leaſt, while the Oracles were conſulted, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally agreed that the Devil had a great Hand in firſt intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, and conſtantly ſupporting the pagan Oracles and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations.</p>
                     <p>Such as are prejudiced againſt the Bible may imagine, that the many Pretences that have been made to divine Revelation by Enthuſiaſts and Impoſtors are a ſufficient Confutation of the Scriptures. But ſuch an Imagination muſt be owing to their great Inattention or inveterate Prejudices. For if the Matter be fully and candidly examined, the various Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that have been made only prove, what I have once and again inculcated that we ſhould receive no Revelations as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, 'till we have juſt Grounds to believe they come from God: We muſt not receive them for divine till they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by proper Miracles. Enthuſiaſts and Impoſtors pretend to divine Revelation, but have never been able to work any Miracles to prove the Truth of their Pretentions.</p>
                     <p>The Prophets and Apoſtles profeſſed to be inſpired and wrought ſuch glorious Miracles as fully proved that God was with them, and that they acted by his Commiſſion.</p>
                     <p>The Fondneſs which Mankind in every Nation have ſhewed for divine Revelation, the Greedineſs, with which they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the various Pretenſions of this Kind, inſtead of weaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Credibility of the Scriptures rather affords a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:009120_0097_1030F34A17AA3A40"/>
to confirm their divine Authority. For whence ſhould this Diſpoſition and Practice of Mankind ariſe? What can be the Reaſon they have been ſo ready to look for and give Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to divine Revelation? Is it not becauſe they are conſcience to themſelves they have great Need of a Guide to direct them? Or from ſome univerſal Tradition that God had actually grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome Revelations? If Men did not feel themſelves ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely in the dark if they had not heard from Tradition, or by their Intercourſe with the Jews, that there was a divine Revelation; is it not probable they would have been ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to follow thoſe who pretended to extraordinary Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications. But having been informed that the Deity had grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed immediate Revelation to ſome excellent Perſon, they might be impoſed on and follow thoſe who pretended to this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with Heaven, eſpecially as they found the Light very inſufficient for their Direction.</p>
                     <p>All who are acquainted with the religious Cuſtoms of the ancient Heathens know there were ſundry Uſages among them which bore ſome Reſemblance to ſome of the Ceremonies which we find were preſcribed by the Jewiſh Law-Giver. Theſe they undoubtedly derived from the Patriarchal Cuſtoms or borrowed from the Jews. <note n="¶" place="bottom">As to what ſome learned Men have conjectured, that many of the Laws of Moſes were inſtituted partly in Compliance to the Prejudices of the Jews, who were fond of the Egyptian Superſtitions; this is an idle Imagination, which is, and always will be deſtitute of all proper Evidence.

And though they did not change their own falſe Gods, and acknowledge the God of Iſrael, yet they might adopt ſome of the Jewiſh Ceremonies in the Worſhip of their Idols, as we are inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

by the ſacred Hiſtorian the Samaritans did to anſwer their now Ends. Now ſince it appears that the Heathens derived ſome of their religious Ceremonies from the Jews, or from the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, why might they not derive the general Notion of a Revelation from the ſame Quarter?</p>
                     <p>If there never had been any true Revelation given to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, what could have led the Heathen Prieſts and and Law-Givers to counterfeit them? <q>Can there be Copies without Originals?

Or do Clippers work on any Thing but Gold and Silver?</q> Thus falſe Pretenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Inſpiration rather ſtrengthen than weaken the Evidences of its Reality—They do ſo in another View, viz. by their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding to the Predictions of the New-Teſtament. The Riſe of falſe Prophets mere Pretenders to Inſpiration, was expreſsly ſore told by Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles; ſo that their Appearance in the World is a completion of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, and as it were a Seal which we ourſelves ſee put to the New-Teſtament, the more fully to illuſtrate and Confirm the Divine Authority of the Scriptures. God will not ſuffer any of his Words to fall to the Ground, let the Things foretold be ever ſo unlikely to human Reaſon. Now muſt not that Propheſy have proceeded from God which is thus exactly verified by the Event? The Scriptures have been confirmed by ſo many infallible Proofs and theſe Arguments have been placed in ſuch a convincing Light, and all the Cavils that have been raiſed, have been ſo fully anſwered by many excellent Writers, that one cannot but think that Infidels diſcover Want of Senſe, as well as Want of Faith: who ſtill perſiſt in their Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.

                     <p>As it would be inconſiſtent with my preſent Deſign to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any long Defence of Chriſtianity, ſo there is no great Occaſion, if the Deiſts would but read and ſeriouſly conſider the many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Books that have been written on the Subject.

You muſt alſo grant, if you ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly reflect on your Conduct, that you have done wrong in ſome Inſtance or other, and conſequently have broken that Law you are under. Hence yon lay expoſed to the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment threatned in the Law. Don't your own Conſciences tell you this ſometimes? Don't they warn you, that though your Sins are pleaſant now, they will be Bitterneſs in the latter End? If they don't, whence comes it that ſundry of you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſo afraid of Death, in Storms and Sickneſs? Let me aſk you, when you are well, and the Weather is Calm, how you expect to eſcape this Puniſhment to which you lay expoſed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your own Scheme, and your own Conſciences, and which you appear to be afraid of in Times of Danger?</p>
                     <p>You will not ſurely pretend that your Repentance and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues will balance your Accounts with God's Law. For not to inſiſt upon it, that you are not very remarkable for theſe Things, you muſt diſcover, if you have any juſt Notions, about Law, that they by no Means anſwer its Demands. A Murderer might Plead with equal Reaſon, that he had mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered but once, that he had been heartily ſorry for his Crime, and had obeyed the Laws of his Country in all other Inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces both before and ſince that unhappy Moment. But you know ſuch Pleas are Nothing to the Purpoſe. The Law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him to Puniſhment and Death for that one Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He muſt plead not guilty, or as good not plead at all. Now you having done wrong in ſome Inſtance or other can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not plead, <hi>not guilty.</hi> You have broken God's Laws, and of Conſequence muſt be condemned by them. God who ſearches your Hearts, and who is perfectly acquainted with all your Conduct is your Judge. He is a moſt juſt and righteous Judge. He gave you his Law, and he will ſupport its Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and the Honor of his Government. Since you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to have any Connexions with Jeſus of Nazareth, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not object againſt being judged on your own Principles. Can you offer any Reaſon why you ſhould not be condemned for your Sins againſt the Light of Nature? Can you deviſe any

Method in which there is any Probability, you ſhall eſcape Puniſhment for your Breaches of God's Law? I believe if you would reaſon right according to your Principles, you would diſpair. Since this appears to be the Caſe, why don't you redeem ſo much Time from the Hurries and Pleaſures of the World, as is ſufficient to make a full Enquiry? Why don't you hear and obey the Voice of that Monitor God has put in your Boſoms, and conſider whether the Alarm is not perfectly juſt, and founded on the moſt inconteſtible Dictates of Reaſon? Why don't you think, whether your boaſted Light of Nature affords you any rational Hopes of Eſcape? Therefore as Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua <note n="‡" place="bottom">Joſhua xxiv. 14, 15.</note> ſaid of old to the Iſraelites, <q>If it ſeem evil to you to ſerve the LORD, chooſe you whom you will to ſerve,</q> ſo I may ſay to you: If you diſlike the chriſtian Religion, chuſe you a better if you can. Shew ſome Method in which Sinners may reaſonably hope for the Pardon of their Sins and to obtain the Favour of an offended God. Don't be ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd as to cavil againſt the Goſpel, and diſcard it, till you can diſcover ſome more ſure and excellent Way. You muſt diſcover aſtoniſhing Weakneſs or Perverſity of Mind who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce that glorious Way, which is plainly revealed and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conteſtibly proved in the Goſpel, if you cannot diſcover any Way of your own, in which any reaſonable Man can hope to be forgiven any of his Sins, and be received into Favour with God.</p>
                     <p>But to return, the high Pretences of Enthuſiaſts to ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Influences, and the great Craft and Indecency which, it appears, Satan has uſed in counterfeiting them is at once a Proof of their Reality and Excellency. If there were no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Influences imparted by the Spirit of God to true Saints, Why ſhould Satan attempt ſo much to counterfeit them? Does not counterfeit Money always ſuppoſe there is true Money? The Devil is a powerful, a malicious and cunning Adverſary. The Scriptures repreſent him as conſtantly and indefatigably employed in ſeeking our Deſtruction. Let ſuch as don't love to be told ſo much about the Devil, tell me, why Chriſt has directed us to pray, lead us not into Temptation, but deliver us from Evil? (or from the Evil One as it might be tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.) Now if Satan be ſo powerful and crafty, we are unable

of ourſelves to reſiſt him, and have therefore abſolute Need to be led by the Divine Spirit, eſpecially if we remember our own Weakneſs through Corruptions and Luſts.</p>

                        <q>Some recommend (ſays a celebrated Preacher of the Church of <hi>England)</hi> Virtue, in pompous Harangues, and urge Religion from the rational Topicks of Conveniency and Inconveniency: They diſplay the Amiableneſs and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Good, and the Deformity and Miſchiefs of Evil. How ugly is Envy? How tormenting is Revenge? How brutal is Drunkenneſs? How pernicious is Luſt? On the contrary; Meekneſs, Temperance, and Beneficence, how ſerene are they in their State, and how commodious in their Effects? And needs a Man now (ſay they) any infuſion here to determine his Choice? Or any aſſiſting Influence to put it in Execution?

But alaſs! theſe are <hi>Zearus</hi>'s Flights. Nature has provided no Wings for Men to ſoar ſo high with. Vice will not be chaſed out of the World by Invectives, nor Virtue advanced to her Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire by panegyricks. The moſt prudent Advertency, and the moſt manly Reſolution, the moſt rational Love, and the moſt generous Indignation, that ever Opinionative Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts could conceive and fortify the Breaſt withal, will not be able to ſecure a Man againſt the <hi>ſubtil</hi> Approaches, or violent Aſſaults of Sin [and Satan.] 'Tis only <hi>divine Grace</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> that is our Caſtle and our Defence, and the vital Spring of all our good Habits: And whoſoever terminates his Hopes, even of ſerving and pleaſing God, upon the Confidence of any other Strength than what is derived from God, his Hopes are impious, and he muſt miſcarry.</q>

                     <p>There is hardly any Thing which Enthuſiaſts in general plead more ſtrongly for their Practices than Conſcience, and it is to be feared many plead Conſcience who ſcarcely know what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience means. As this is evidently the Caſe, it will not be amiſs briefly to explain the Nature of Conſcience, that you
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:009120_0099_1030F353D64FBF08"/>
may not plead it; where it cannot lay under a proper Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>The Will and Law of God is holy, juſt and good, which all moral Agents are bound in Duty to obey by what Means ſoever it is made known to them. This is the ſupreme Rule and original Standard of all moral Goodneſs. God has been pleaſed to diſcover this his Will to Mankind in ſeveral Ways, as by Conſcience, Reaſon, Revelation. <hi>Conſcience is that Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Soul, by which God gives Mankind ſome Notices of his Will, of Virtue and Vice, of Praiſe and Blame, and by which, when it is in right Exerciſe, we approve of whatever, we have ſufficient Reaſon to believe is agreeable to the holy Will of God, whether in ourſelves or others, and Condemn what is contrary to this divine Standard.</hi> 
                        <q>When the Gentiles, <hi>ſays the Apoſtle,</hi> 
                           <note n="a" place="bottom">Rom ii. 14 15.</note> which have not the <hi>[written]</hi> Law, do by Nature the Things contained in the Law, theſe having not the Law, are a Law unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; which ſhew the Work of the Law written in their Hearts, their Conſcience alſo bearing Witneſs, and their Thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.</q> Hence Conſcience is called God's Deputy or Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerent in the Soul. When any Thing is known to be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Will of God, Conſcience in its proper Exerciſe urge to obey, and remonſtrates againſt Diſobedience, threatning Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from God. But Conſcience is only a Deputy. It is not Conſcience of itſelf which properly binds or obliges a Man, but the Will and Law of God which is written in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>s Records. Conſcience derives all its juſt Authority from God.</p>
                     <p>Truth and Falſhood, Right and Wrong, cannot be changed by the Fancies of Men. The Will of God remains ſtill the ſame. Hence though ſuch is the natural Frame and Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Human Nature, that an honeſt Man cannot but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Conſcience; though he would ſin, if he ſhould coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract the Dictates of his Mind, and be ſelf-condemned, as the Apoſtle <note n="b" place="bottom">Rom. xiv. 23.</note> intimates; yet when Conſcience is miſinformed, and abuſes its Office, repreſenting Right to be Wrong, and Wrong to be Right; this Miſtake cannot alter the Nature of Things nor change the divine Law. A Man is not <hi>properly obliged</hi> in this Caſe to act contrary to the Will of God, but is rather bound to renounce his Errors and ſearch out the divine Law
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:009120_0100_1030F35576840630"/>
and obey it. Paul before he was converted verily believed in his Conſcience, that he ought to do many Things in Oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Jeſus of Nazareth: Yet when he came to be better informed, he blamed himſelf, and lamented over that Conduct as ſinful. Tho' his miſtaken Conſcience did in ſome Meaſure alleviate his Crime, yet he was far from thinking it entirely excuſed him. He <note n="c" place="bottom">1. Tim. i. 13,—16.</note> mentions it as a Sin for which he had Need of Mercy. When forty of the Jews in their great Zeal judged in their Conſciences, they ought to murder Paul, this did not render Murder a Virtue, and ſuch Conduct acceptable to God. Their Conſcience in this Inſtance had not God's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
                     <p>As Conſcience is not the only Means by which God reveals his Will ſince he has given us Reaſon and Revelation, ſo it is alſo greatly enfeebled in this imperfect State, and often miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the divine Will. Therefore its haſty Dictates ſhould not be raſhly obeyed. Reaſon and Revelation ſhould be ſeriouſly conſulted, leaſt Men inſtead of obeying the holy Will of God ſhould be found following the Dictates of their own corrupted Underſtandings or the Suggeſtions of Satan. And ſince the Will of God is the only perfect Rule and original Standard of moral Goodneſs, and Conſcience only a Deputy, and one too that is often miſtaken, Men ſhould have Recourſe to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law, and carefully examine, if God requires ſuch Things. Unleſs you can produce ſome divine Law that requires you to do ſo and ſo, it is in vain for you to plead Conſcience: For where there is no Law, there is properly no Duty nor Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. And if Conſcience forbids or commands an Action, where there is no divine Law, in this Inſtance Conſcience abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes its Office, and the Man is not properly obliged, unleſs he can be ſtrictly and truly obliged to diſobey the holy Will of God, which is abſurd.</p>
                     <p>Hence it appears that God has not laid you under Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to follow your new Revelations and Impulſes, ſince you cannot prove by the proper Evidence of Miracles that they proceed from God. Your new Revelations and Impulſes are not the natural Dictates of Conſcience or a Part of the moral Law, which God has written on the Heart. For then theſe Revelations could not be called new, nor peculiar to you more

                        </gap>ou cannot prove them to be immediate Revelations of the Will of God, becauſe they are deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of his Seal of public Miracles. Now ſince your Revelations do not appear to be the Will of God, I hope your Conſciences will find themſelves diſentangled from all imaginary Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and not urge you to follow them any more. Surely it is reaſonable that theſe imaginary Chains ſhould be looſed. You may ſee you can be under no proper Obligations from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to follow your new Revelations and Impulſes. It is weak and ridiculous to plead Conſcience for following your Impulſes, or for any Practice which you can't prove to be agreeable to the Will of God. If you plead Conſcience any more, then produce ſome Law of God that obliges you to practice as you do. But if you can produce no divine Precept, and yet continue in ſuch unlawful Practices, you may plead Ignorance, you may plead Prejudice, you may plead Self-Will, you may plead ſtrong Imagination, or the Tranſports of hot Zeal, or Pride; but you have no Right to plead Conſcience for your Practices, till you can produce the divine Law where God has required theſe Things at your Hands. <note n="¶" place="bottom">
                           <p>Some very ingenious Philoſophers ſeem to have coined a new Name for Conſcience, calling it a Moral Senſe. This new Name perhaps has not helped much to throw any new Light on the Thing. Conſcience both Name and Thing was well known to the ancient Jews, Greeks, Romans, &amp;c. And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all that the ingenious Profeſſor <hi>Smith</hi> has ſaid, I can't but think, that Conſcience or Moral Senſe is a much more important and intelligible Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Morals than Sympathy, as well as more univerſally known.</p>

When any in ill Blood deny ſuch Truths, as that there is a God, and Parents are to be loved, we all ſay ſuch do ſin and offer Violence to their Conſcience—There is more Reaſon and ſound Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the Conſcience, than in the whole underſtanding Soul.

To receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Rebukes from Conſcience in ſo far as they come from the Word of Truth is ſpiritual Prudence, and he that turneth away his Ear from his Conſcience ſhall die.

Some's Conſcience fancied that to kill their Children to Molech was a Doctrine that entered into the Heart of God to command, Jer. 7.30, 31.—Hence Conſcience muſt be ruled by Scripture.

If Parents will be ſo fond of their Children, as to bring them up too delicately, and never inure them to any Hardſhips; the Conſequence will ordinarily be, that they will weaken their Children's Conſtitutions, and thus ſubject them to many Ails and Sickneſſeſs which they would probably never have known any Thing about, if it had not been for the extreme Tenderneſs of their Parents. However, no Directions can be given that will be ſufficient effectually to preſerve Health, and ſave the human Body from many Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Wounds, Bruiſes, &amp;c.

Is it not certain in a thouſand Inſtances that Phyſicians under God have been a Means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Life? God works in this as well as in many other Caſes by ſecond Cauſes.

                     <p>Joſeph was one of the wiſeſt of Men and a moſt eminent Saint. His Conſcience was remarkably tender, as appears from his repulſing the impure Solicitations of his Miſtreſs with this memorable Saying, <q>How can I do this great Evil and Sin agaiſt God?</q>

<pb n="185" facs="unknown:009120_0102_1030F35A483EEE70"/>
the Churches of New-England, to conſider what has been ſaid with that ſeriouſneſs which the Importance of the Affair juſtly demands. The Honour of God, the Intereſt of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer's Kingdom, the Welfare of your Country and your Poſterity, and even the Salvation of your own Souls will be greatly affected by your Conduct. Now when ſuch important Intereſts are at Stake, you muſt excuſe me if I ſpeak plainly to you. When you have ſeparated from us, you have ſet up and followed ſuch for Teachers among yourſelves, as profeſſed to be immediately called. This your immediate Call has been candidly examined in the preceeding Diſcourſe, and it has, I think been plainly and fully proved that you are falſe Prophets and Teachers. Several of you have pretended to foretell future Things, which the Event has proved to be falſe. Now if you hearken either to the Voice of Reaſon or to the Word of God, you muſt be convinced that this is a full and clear Proof that you are falſe Prophets. And tho' others may ſay, that they have not been thus detected, or that their Prophecies have never been proved falſe by the Event; yet this will not excuſe them. For it is <hi>the fundamental Principle</hi> in your Scheme, and what you all Act upon; <hi>that Truths and Duties are diſcovered to you by Impulſes or immediate Impreſſions made on your Minds.</hi> As the true Church of Chriſt is built upon the Foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, or the written Word of God, ſo your ſeparate Aſſemblies which you call Churches are built upon private Impulſes. Now it has been proved in the foregoing Pages, that theſe Impreſſions, if they come from God as you pretend, are as really Revelations as any that were made to inſpired Perſons of old; and that ſome of them, ſuch for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, as thoſe by which your Teachers pretend to be called to the Miniſtry, are Revelations of new Truths, which are not contained in the Bible. But God forbids our receiving any Thing as a Revelation from him, which has not his Seal. And therefore ſince you cannot work Miracles in Confirmation of your being ſent of him in an extraordinary Way, God requires us to account and treat you as deluded Perſons, and your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended inſpired Teachers as falſe Prophets. It ſeems to me this muſt convince you, at leaſt bring you to entertain ſome Doubts and Scruples, unleſs you ſhut your Eyes againſt Conviction, or are judicially given up to ſtrong Deluſions.

There never was a Seaſon in which more Perſons pretended to Inſpiration, or to have Truths and Duties revealed to them by immediate Suggeſtions and Impulſes. And as no one of theſe Perſons produces proper Credentials, or has the Seal of God to ſhew; both Reaſon and Scripture allow, and indeed require us to look on them all as falſe Prophets or Teachers. Yet it is ſadly true that they have deceived many, leading them from the Word of God to follow their deluded Fancies. They have been unhappily ſucceſsful in filling the Minds of many well-meaning Perſons with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt the regular Miniſters of Chriſt.

that can never be defended, many of them being really abſurd and ridiculous. You teach Perſons to place Religion in Things that can never be received by a rational Mind. You are unwearied in your Endeavours to deſtroy the Influence of the ſtanding Miniſters repreſenting them as carnal, blind and dead, as Hirelings and Miniſters of Antichirſt. And the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence has been that many unthinking Perſons are careleſs about or prejudiced againſt all Religion, and it is to be feared will turn open Infidels. You with the greateſt Confidence pronounce this Man converted, and that Man immediately called of God to the Miniſtry; when all your underſtanding Neighbours plainly ſee, that the former wants the Scripture Marks of Converſion, and perhaps is further from the Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a good Man than he was before; and that the latter is deſtitute of the moſt eſſential Qualifications of a Goſpel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.

On the whole, it may be juſtly doubted, whether you could have done ſo much Hurt to Religion, if you had been open and profeſſed Enemies to it, as you have done under the Profeſſion of the higheſt Friendſhip to it, and a Cloak of the moſt flaming Zeal. If you are unprejudiced enough to feel the Force of my Reaſoning, yet methinks a View of the preſent State of Religion in the Country, joined with the Conſideration that it is plainly fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told in the Scriptures, that when falſe Prophets and Teachers ſhould riſe and deceive many, Iniquity ſhould abound, the Love of many wax cold, and the Ways of Truth be evil ſpoken of, muſt at leaſt abate your Confidence, and raiſe ſome Suſpicion in your Minds whether you are not miſtaken, and whether your Conduct does not deſtroy inſtead of promoting Religion.</p>
                     <p>After all, I have no great Expectations of convincing the Heads and Leaders of your Parties; but I hope what has been ſaid may by the Bleſſing of God have a good Effect upon ſome honeſt People that have been miſled and ſeduced by them. And I more eſpecially hope, that all who attend your Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies

either out of Curioſity, or on Account of their being near their Habitations, while they don't profeſs to join with you, will conſider ſeriouſly what has been ſaid. I know ſome of you have ſundry Things to ſay in your own Vindication. And ſince my chief Hopes of Succeſs are among you, I ſhall conculde this Addreſs by anſwering your Arguments, and giving my Reaſons againſt your Practice.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. Some of you are ready to plead that theſe Sects hold a great many good Things, and their Exhorters ſay ſome good Things. And why may not you go and hear them? Why need Miniſters ſay any Thing againſt them?</p>
                     <p>ANSWER. Don't you think that the Papiſts, Jews, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans, and Deiſts, hold many good Things? When we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt them, it is not againſt the good Things which they hold in common with us, but againſt their Errors. The Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, whether thoſe Things wherein they differ from us are good? Whether conſidering them as Papiſts, Jews, Mahometans, and Deiſts, they are right; to be countenanced and followed. And thus it is with Reſpect to theſe ſeveral Sects I have been oppoſing. There is no Doubt but they hold ſome good Things, I wiſh they held more. I have no Controverſy with them about the Truths they believe, but about their Errors. Now the Queſtion is whether they are right in thoſe Peculiarities wherein they differ from the ſtanding Churches? For theſe are the Things that denominate them to belong to ſome or other of theſe Sects. I have plainly declared my Sentiments, that they are entirely wrong in their Peculiarites, and I can't but believe you muſt be of my Mind if you peruſe this Addreſs with ſufficient Care and Candour. If you think they are right in their diſtinguiſhing Tenets, why don't you join them? And if you cannot prove they are right in their peculiar Notions, your pleading they are right in thoſe Things which they hold in common with us is really Nothing at all to your Purpoſe. There never was any Sect of Hereticks ſo corrupt as to deny all Truths, ſo that by this Rule Miniſters ſhould never try to reclaim Perſons from their Miſtakes, and conſequently the Apoſtles did very wrong in reproving and w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>iting againſt the falſe Teachers that diſturbed the Churches in their Days.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. But you have a more plauſible Argument. You ſay, when you look <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ound on the ſtanding Churches and their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:009120_0105_1030F364D93BABC8"/>
you can ſcarcely ſee any Appearance of Religion. A dull Formality prevails in attending publick Worſhip, and at other Times much Vanity, Frothineſs, yea and much open Profaneneſs. The Youth are light, airy, careleſs and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious; the aged worldly, luke-warm and indifferent about ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Piety. Whereas when you look among the ſeparate Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and thoſe that attend them, you ſee much Solemnity and Seriouſneſs. In ſhort you ſay there is a much greater Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Religion among them than in the ſtanding Churches.</p>
                     <p>ANSWER. As I have already conſidered the extraordinary reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Appearances which are among them, and I think fully proved that they are no good Proof that they are right, I ſhall not here repeat what I have ſaid, but ſeriouſly entreat you to review thoſe Paſſages again. There is doubtleſs great Reaſon to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over the prevailing Iniquities of the Times, and the Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of many that belong to the ſtanding Churches. But ſince thoſe who have ſeparated from us have had a principal Hand by their diſorderly Practices to provoke God to withdraw his Spirit, to raiſe and foment Pejudices in the Minds of People againſt their Miniſters, and thus to promote the Wickedneſs ſo much lamented among us, I can't but think, that when they upbraid us with theſe Things they muſt do it with a peculiar ill Grace.</p>
                     <p>This is an Objection which was made of old againſt Chriſt and his true followers. <q>The Diſciples of John and of the Phariſees uſed to faſt, and they came and ſaid unto Chriſt, why do the Diſciples of John, and of the Phariſees faſt, but thy Diſciples faſt not?</q> 
                        <note n="f" place="bottom">Mark ii, 18.</note> They were it ſeems greatly ſtumbled, and much at a Loſs about Chriſt and his Diſciples, becauſe (as they thought) they did not appear to be ſo ſtrict and religious, as the Diſciples of John and of the Phariſees. It is abundantly evident from the New-Teſtament that the Phariſees were very ſtrict and devout in their Way. They were frequent in their religious Exerciſes, ſince they faſted twice in the Week. The Mahometans are very frequent in their Devotions, and they value themſelves on being more ſtrict and virtuous, than they think Chriſtians are. Hence it is reported to be a common ſaying among them, <q>would you have me to ſwear and lie like a Chriſtian.</q> If we come to Chriſtendom, have not the Papiſts a much greater ſhow of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion than the Proteſtants? Where can you find any Man ſo
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:009120_0106_1030F369474B0120"/>
ſtrict and devout in his Way as the famous Abbe <hi>de Paris?</hi> And there are great Numbers who profeſs the Romiſh Religion, who are eminent for extraordinary Faſtings, Penances and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions, far beyond what prevails among Proteſtants. And I have been credibly informed that Popery ſpreads and gains Ground among the common People in ſome Places in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, on this very Account, that the Papiſts are more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and devout in their religious Exerciſes. Suppoſe you had been carried Captive to <hi>Canada</hi> in the begining of the War, and had ſeen the Papiſts frequent, engaged and lively in their religious Worſhip, as they are ſaid to have been if I remember right, and then upon an Exchange of Priſoners, when you came into the Engliſh Army, you ſhould have perceived ſcarcely any Appearance of Religion, but the general Part Curſing and Swearing, what would you have done? According to your Objection you muſt have been ready to change your Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and become Papiſts, at leaſt you muſt have been greatly at a Loſs, whether they were not after all in the right. Thus your Argument concludes as ſtrongly in Favour of the Phariſees, Mahometans, and Papiſts, as it does in Favour of thoſe who have ſeparated from our Churches. Yet I dare ſay you have no Tho'ts of profeſſing yourſelves Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, Papiſts, or Mahometans. Your Argument proves too much, if it could prove any Thing, and therefore it muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon a Miſtake. The Miſtake in this Reſpect is your making the external Shew of Religion a certain Mark, and Evidence of Perſon's being right. Now you might have known from the common Proverb, "all is not Gold that gliſters" that ſome profeſs a great deal of Religion, who have no more of it in Reality, than their Neighbours. Was not this the Caſe with the Phariſees, the Mahometans and Papiſts? As I don't pretend to ſearch the Hearts, nor to know how far God may permit Saints to be deluded by Satan, as David was when he was influenced by this proud Spirit to number the People, as Peter was who thro' his Inſtigation denied his Lord and Maſter; ſo I cannot tell how many of thoſe who thro' his Deluſions have ſeparated from us, are ſincerely religious. But be that as it may, I am ſure they are wrong in yielding to his Deluſions, and I am ſure you would be very wrong in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them. I cannot think that their following their own erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:009120_0106_1030F369474B0120"/>
and heated Imaginations, and the Deluſions of Satan, is any great Sign of eminent Holineſs.</p>
                     <p>As it is natural for ſurperſtitious and deluded Devotees to appear more religious than they really are, and to make a great Shew of external Piety, when they are utter Strangers to it; I have often wondered that thoſe who have ſeparated from the ſtanding Churches have not been more eminent for their viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Purity and Holineſs than they generally are at preſent. They withdrew from us, becauſe they imagined our Churches were not pure. They were a ſelect Company of true Converts as they themſelves gave out. And yet if we make the Goſpel our Rule by which to judge of Purity, I believe they don't ſhine very bright.—As our Churches contain in ſome Senſe the general Part of thoſe that are born and brought up in the Land, and there's a ſmall Company who all profeſſed to be true Converts, it would not have been wonderful, if their Members had greatly outſhined ours, conſidered as a Body. For they pretended to the greateſt Purity, and their Character and Credit as a Party depended very much on making good their Pretenſions. Now Pride will excite Men to do a great Deal in Religion, when their Credit of Intereſt lies at Stake. How many brave Things did Jehu do? Yet notwithſtanding all theſe powerful Motives and peculiar Advantages which they have had, I believe if you candidly conſider their Members and ours, and the ſeveral violent Heats and unchriſtian Contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that have ariſen among them, at one Time and another, &amp;c. you muſt acknowledge they have very little to boaſt of, even in Point of viſible Purity. According to my Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the Account I have received from ſeveral worthy Gentlemen that are acquainted with them, there have been as many Scandals among them for their Number, and the Time they have ſeparated, as in the ſtanding Churches. And I believe they have ſhewed as little Zeal and Faithfulneſs in cenſuring Offenders as any Church in the Land. If they were to be tried by the Standard of Purity before impartial Judges, they would probably be found to be no Gainers by their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. And if we remember that it has been proved, that many of thoſe Things which they call the eminent Exerciſes of Religion proceed from unſcriptural Notions, and wild Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations or the Suggeſtions of Satan; the Advantage in Point
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:009120_0107_1030F36FA0453330"/>
of true Religion, ſincere Chriſtian Piety, is almoſt beyond Compariſon on the Side of the ſtanding Churches. For ſtrip their Religion of Extravagancies, and what have they left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind? They have the outſide Shew of Religion, but where is there any Thing among them like internal Holineſs and real Humbleneſs of Heart? Where is their Meekneſs? Where their Charity? Now according to the Apoſtle, It a Man ſhould ſpeak with the Tongues of Men, and of Angels, and have not Charity, he is become as a ſounding Braſs and a tinkling Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal: Though he had the <hi>Gift</hi> of Prophecy, and underſtood all Myſteries—and have no Charity, he is Nothing; yea, tho' he ſhould be ſo zealous as to give his Body to be burned, and have not Charity, it profiteth him Nothing.</p>
                     <p>But I don't deſire to puſh this Point too far. As I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted, the Practiſes of thoſe who profeſs any certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhould not be made the grand Mark or Evidence by which we ſhould judge of its Truth or Falſhood. There have been very excellent Perſons who have ſeemed to differ greatly in their religious Sentiments about various Things. Some wicked Perſons have belonged to the beſt and pureſt Churches, as Simon Magus to that of the Apoſtles. When we examine whether ſuch a religious Denomination be right, the proper Queſtions to be diſcuſed are, what do they believe? what are their peculiar Tenets and diſtinguiſhing Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples? If we find theſe to be agreeable to the Word of God, we muſt pronounce them right, let the Profeſſors of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion live as they will. If their Practice is bad, this does not prove that the Religion which they profeſs is bad, when by the Suppoſition it is agreeable to the holy Scriptures, but that they practiſe contrary to their Good Principles. Thus tho' many profeſſing Chriſtians in St. Paul's Time appeared by their wicked Practices to be Enemies of the Croſs of Chriſt, this was no good Argument to prove that the Chriſtian Religion was bad. The Goſpel was not the Worſe for their wicked Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, ſince it did not countenance them in their Wickedneſs, but bore an open Teſtimony againſt all Sorts of Iniquity. And thus the ſtanding Churches are not to be blamed for the Luke-warmneſs, the Irreligion and Profaneneſs, which alas! too much prevail among many in the preſent Day; for we don't approve of their Luke-warmneſs and Wickedneſs. With the
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:009120_0107_1030F36FA0453330"/>
Apoſtles of old we bear the moſt public and earneſt Teſtimony againſt all Manner of Vice and Immorality. And thus the Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities, which ſome, who in ſome Senſe belong to the ſtanding Churches are guilty of, can be no proper Grounds of Stumbling and Offence, ſince they are duly teſtified againſt Time after Time. And much leſs can they be any juſt Cauſe of Separation. There were many in the Apoſtolic Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches who were Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt. Luke-warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prevailed to a dreadful Degree in the Church of Landice<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

little like Religion; than the regular ſtanding Churches whoſe Principles are known to be founded on the Scriptures, ſince there are ſome Luke-warm Profeſſors and vicious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons belonging to them, whom they greatly diſapprove and faithfully exhort to forſake their wicked Courſes?</q> When your Objection is thus fairly ſtated, I hope you can ſee that it is not very weighty. I believe I need ſay no more to it, unleſs it be to put you in Mind, that while you accuſe others of Luke-warmneſs and Irreligion, you yourſelves ſhould be eminently holy. No Body hinders you in the ſtanding Churches to grow in Grace, and let your Light ſhine before Men that they may be brought to glorify your Father who is in Heaven.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. But why does God own thoſe who have ſeparated from us if they were ſo very wrong?</p>
                     <p>ANSWER. How do you know that he does own them? God may over-rule a Temptation of Satan, or a Perſon's falling into a grevious Sin to be a Means of ſaving Good to his Soul. But would you run into Sin, or the Temptations of Satan in Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of receiving this ſaving Good? You ſhould remember what I have already obſerved, that when we ſpeak of any reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Sect of People, we always refer to their peculiar diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Principles. Now you have no Reaſon to think that God ever improved any of the peculiar Principles of theſe Sects to do any Good to one Soul, otherwiſe than he might over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the Temptations of the Evil Spirit. Whereas on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, you have the moſt ſolid Reaſons to convince you that God has frequently bleſſed the Doctrines of the ſtanding Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Churches for the ſaving Benefit of the Souls of his People. Do you conſider what you ſay, when you talk about God's owning theſe ſeparate Teachers and Aſſemblies? Do you, can you, ſoberly think that God approves of Errors and wild Diſorders? And is it not certain that theſe are their Peculiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? If they are not owned in theſe Things, they are not owned at all. Suppoſe then it were certain that God bleſſed ſome Truths which they chance ſometimes to deliver for the Benefit of ſome Perſons, this is not to be looked on as his own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, ſince this is only his bleſſing his own Truth and not an Approbation of their Errors. And thus it ſeems he bleſſed his Truths in Paul's Time tho' delivered by Men who preached Chriſt out of Envy.</p>

                     <p>It is repreſented in the Word of God as a Sinful Thing to continue fickle and unſettled in your Sentiments about Religion. Moſt certainly Religion is a Matter of ſuch Importance, as ſhould engage your moſt ſerious Attention. You ſhould care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully examine what is right, and adhere to it with Stedfaſtneſs. Hence the Iſralites of old were blamed for halting between two Opinions.

Muſt not your wavering between one Opinion and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ariſe from this Sort of Childiſhneſs and Sillineſs; or from ſuch an Indifferency to all Religion, that you don't think it worth while to examine it at all. I can't but be afraid this is the Caſe with ſome of you, tho' I hope better of others. But be that as it may, certainly you don't repreſent yourſelves in a good Light, who having grown up in a Chriſtian Land, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt excellent, religious Advantages, and yet are ſo ignorant or unſtable, that you are ready at every Turn to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your profeſſed Principles, and become the Proſelytes of every enthuſiaſtic Sect, and ſeparate Party.</p>
                     <p>How many of thoſe who have ſeparated from us, ſolemnly promiſed before God, Angels and Men, that they would ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adhere to the holy Scriptures, and ſeek the Peace and Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our Churches.

and deſtroy us. Now what can be done with Perſons, who from Impulſes or Prejudices, or both, thus openly break their ſolemn Promiſes and Covenant Engagements? God commands, and they promiſed to ſeek and maintain Peace. And yet they uſe their utmoſt Endeavours to promote Diviſion, Strife and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, as if they had determined to act in the moſt open De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of their ſolemn Vows and Promiſes as well as of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Had we impoſed any unſcriptural Terms of Communion on them, this would have made us the Breakers of the Covenant Contract, and afforded them a good Plea for Separation, if they had patiently endured and tried to make us ſenſible of our Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. But we have remained true and ſtedfaſt to our Covenant, adhering ſtrictly to the Word of God, teaching thoſe Things, and thoſe only which Chriſt has commanded in his written Word. And thus it clearly appears, they have ſeparated from the ſtanding Churches for the Sake of their own beloved Errors, their Impulſes, Revelations, &amp;c. Now when you attend on their Meetings Time after Time, don't you encourage them to go on in theſe their Errors, which are of ſuch a dangerous Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to the Souls of Men; which threaten to ſubvert the Scriptures, and root out all ſincere experimental Religion. Do you think this is acting a friendly Part to them, or to the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Churches, or to yourſelves.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems by your Conduct, you can hear them reproach, vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify and contemn all the Churches and Miniſters of Chriſt in the Land, as Limbs of Anti-Chriſt, and Synagogues of Satan, without any Appearance of Diſſatisfaction; nay, with ſeeming Approbation. For why elſe do you attend their Meetings? And yet aſtoniſhing! ſundry of you would take it hard to be excluded from chriſtian Privileges in our Churches. Is not this ſtrange and inconſiſtent Conduct? When you review it ſoberly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> can you poſſibly believe that Chriſt the great King and Head of the Church approves of your Practice? Has he left you at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to countenance Enthuſiaſts in their Errors, and confirm them in their awful Deluſions and Evil-Speekings; and to weaken the Hands of thoſe who upon your own Principles are his true Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Churches? Yet you can't but ſee, if you ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſider Matters, that this is the native Tendency of you Conduct, in frequenting their Meetings.</p>
                     <p>God has given us ſundry Directions or Rules with Regard to
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:009120_0109_1030F372CD5ADA90"/>
Deceivers, falſe Prophets or Teachers, which you would do well ſeriouſly to conſider ſuch as, <q>Mark them which cauſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Offences, contrary to the Doctrine which ye have learned and avoid them. Beware of falſe Prophets which come to you in Sheep's Cloathing</q> with ſpecious Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of eminent Religion. According to the Scripture, if a falſe Teacher or Prophet come unto you, <q>you muſt not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him into your Houſe, neither bid him God Speed. For he that biddeth him God Speed, is Partaker of his evil Deeds.</q> 
                        <note n="h" place="bottom">Rom. xvi 17. Matt. vii. 15. 2 John vii, — 11.</note> Theſe ſeparate Teachers whoſe Miniſtrations you attend, are either what they profeſs, that is, Perſons ſent and inſpired of God in an extraordinary and immediate Way, or elſe they are Deceivers and falſe Teachers. That they are not thus ſent of God has been fully proved already; and you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeem to allow it, ſince you don't profeſs to join with them as compleat Members. It is evident therefore that they are in Truth and in your Opinion falſe Prophets. Since therefore your attending upon their Meetings is a very great Encouragement to them, and has a Tendency to ſtrengthen and confirm them in their erroneous Principles and Practices, you make your ſelves acceſſary to all the Injury they do to Religion; you make yourſelves Partakers of their evil Deeds, and you will at laſt find yourſelves anſwerable to God for the Conſequences.</p>
                     <p>As this your Conduct is ſinful, offenſive to God, and hurtful to Religion, you have awful Reaſon to fear, leſt God in his righteous Judgment ſhould give you over to ſtrong Deluſions, and leave you fully to join with them in the worſt of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagancies in Principle and Practice; even to go to that hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Length to which John Lewis and the Dutartres were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried of Satan. 'Tis often obſerved, that when a new Sect of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſts ariſes, many follow them, and attend their Meetings; ſome out of Curioſity, and ſome perhaps to divert themſelves with their Extravagance and Nonſenſe. After a while ſome will attend becauſe the Place of their Meeting is nearer them, than that to which they belong, or becauſe they are diſaffected to the Miniſter or ſome of the Church; and ſome of theſe Perſons at length go fully into thoſe Principles and Practices, which they at firſt abhorred. This in many Caſes at leaſt ſeems plainly to be owing to their being given up to ſtrong Deluſions,
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:009120_0110_1030F3745BEA1670"/>
to believe a a Lie, becauſe they received not the Truth in the Love of it. Inſtances of this Kind ſhould ſerve as a Warning to you. And the Improvement you ſhould make of them, is this, you ſhould forſake the Tents of theſe deluded Men.</p>
                     <p>As the Separatiſts, when they hear any Story that reflects Diſgrace upon our Churches, eſpecially on the Miniſters, we from long Experience don't expect they will take any ſuitable Pains to enquire whether it be true or falſe; but that they will rather employ all the Strength of their gloomy Imagination in exaggerating it, till it becomes quite frightful; and then deal by it as the Levite did with his Concubine, cut it into Pieces and ſend to all the Coaſts of Iſrael to raiſe the popular Odium. And what is yet worſe, if they can find Nothing of a public Nature ſufficient to ruin a Miniſter's Character and Uſefulneſs, they will give broad Hints and frequently, expreſsly affirm that he is unconverted, or at beſt fallen from God and become dead. And it is to be greatly lamented that this ſame anſavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Leaven has deeply infected many of the ſtanding Churches. Sundry great Profeſſors, if we may judge from their Practice, ſeem to imagine that a conſiderable Part of Religion conſiſts in decrying Miniſters. To hear them diſcourſe on this darling Topic, one would think the preſent Set of Miniſters in this Country were a Parcel of ſilly Ideots or deſigning Knaves, or that the Declaimers were Pupils of Shaftſbury or Bolingbrook.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch can ſtop a little in their Harangue, I would aſk what Evil have we done? What are the Crimes you have to charge againſt us? Are there any of us guilty of Hereſy or Scandal? Point out the Men and proſecute them according to the Rules of the Word. Let the groſsly Ignorant, the Heterodox and Scandalous be complained of, tried and depoſed unleſs they amend.

                     <p>That none may think I have mentioned theſe Things with a View of ſcreening myſelf from their private Jealouſies, dark Innuendoes, or public and expreſs Declarations, I here give all and every Perſon full Liberty to take any or all of theſe Methods ſo far as I am concerned, if they can be ſo weak as to

think them commendable, or that they can't maintain their Principles, and anſwer my Arguments in any other Manner. Predeſtination is an Article of my Creed. Hence I believe that God who has ſaid to the Sea, <q>Hitherto ſhalt thou come but no farther: And here ſhall thy proud Waves be ſtayed,</q> will alſo reſtrain the Wrath and Malice of Men, ſo that they can do me no Injury without the divine Permiſſion. I have long ſince read, and endeavoured thoroughly to imbibe and practiſe upon the Sentiment of the Apoſtle in the following Words, <q>With me it is a very ſmall Matter that I ſhould be judged of you, or of Man's Judgment: Yea I judge not mine own ſelf. For I know Nothing by myſelf, yet am I not hereby juſtified: But he that judgeth me is the Lord. Therefore judge Nothing before the Time, until the Lord come, who both will bring to Light the hidden Things of Darkneſs, and will make manifeſt The Counſels of the Heart.</q> 
                        <note n="b" place="bottom">1 Cor. iv. 3,—5.</note> This Paſſage contains (as Dr. Doddridge juſtly obſerves) a gentle, but very affecting Inſinuation that his Opponents, confident as thay might ſeem in their own Integrity and Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would do well to take <hi>greater</hi> Heed, that they were not impoſed upon by the Deceitfulneſs of their own Hearts; that under ſpecious Forms his Enemies concealed very dark De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns which would not bear the Diſcoveries of the awful Day of Judgment; as alſo a very ſolid Argument againſt <hi>magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying one Miniſter above another,</hi> namely, that the ſecret Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Men's Actions are unknown.</p>
                     <p>At preſent I ſhall only hint that Chriſt has inſtituted the Goſpel-Miniſtry, and that Miniſters are his Ambaſſadors, and conſequently that he requires all his People to treat them with that Regard which is due to them in this Character, and that he accounts the unjuſt Indignities and Contempt offered to them as offered to himſelf. And as to you who have not withdrawn from our Churches, but attend the Ordinances we adminiſter, you muſt at leaſt allow me to plead in Behalf of Miniſters the common Privilege of Brethren. It is the ſecond Command of Chriſt to love your Neighbours and Brethren as yourſelves. Now by your attending the Sacraments with us, you promiſe and ſwear that you will ſincerely keep all the Commands of Chriſt, conſequently that you will love your Miniſters as

yourſelves, ſince you muſt at leaſt allow that we are Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Brethren. But if inſtead of loving us as yourſelves, you indulge unchriſtian Jealouſies and Suſpicions, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to weaken our Influence and ruin our Characters by dark Innuendoes, you muſt permit me to aſk you, whether this be not comprehended in Scripture in the Words <hi>Backbiting</hi> and <hi>ſmiling ſecretly.</hi> And if it is, you would do well to remember, that God has ſaid, <q>Curſed be he that ſmiteth his Neighbour ſecretly, and all the People ſhall ſay, Amen.</q> Let Men then take Heed to themſelves, leſt while they are ſecretly judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſmiting others they ſhould be condemned themſelves.</p>
                     <p>Separatiſts of one Kind and another commonly buzz it into People's Ears where they think they are likely to have any Influence, that all, who join in communion with a Church in which there are any Perſons guilty of ſcandalous Sins, erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Opinions, or chargeable with Backſliding and Luke-warmneſs, are as wicked as the Perſons themſelves who have actually fallen into ſuch Sins. And as it cannot he denied that there are ſundry Perſons in the ſtanding Churches, whom we have Reaſon to mourn over with the Apoſtle 2 Cor. xii. 20, 21. this is a Topic which affords them Matter for many zealous and bitter Declamations, which have a Tendency to alarm the Conſciences of weak Perſons. Yet this Principle is a very ignorant and wild Conceit.</p>
                     <p>The Means of Grace and the Ordinances of the Goſpel were not appointed for ſincere Believers as ſuch, but for the viſible Church, for viſible Believers and their Seed. Thus Moſes inſtructed. Thus Iſrael underſtood and practiſed. Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached to the unconverted, and commanded them to <q>take Heed how they heard and to repent and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</q> When the Apoſtle Peter looked on Simon Magus to be unconverted he directed him to pray—The Ordinances of the Goſpel were not inſtituted nor deſigned to teſtify that we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that all with whom we join are ſincere Saints, nor that we approve their Conduct, but they were appointed to repreſent Chriſt and his Benefits. This is their principal End. With Reſpect to our Brethren with whom we join in Communion, we teſtify by our Conduct, that ſo far as we have any certain Knowledge about their Practice, all Things conſidered as Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are circumſtanced, we may lawfully join in Communion
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:009120_0111_1030F375F3F71DA8"/>
with them. And though they ſhould be guilty of many Sins, yet we are not in any Senſe chargeable with them, if we have carefully followed what appeared to us to be the Mind of Chriſt in reproving, diſciplining, and teſtifying againſt their erroneous Opinions and ſinful Practices; all which we may do according to the Rules of the Goſpel, without any Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Church to which they belong. Unleſs this be allowed it will follow that the Prophets and Apoſtles were defiled by holding Communion with the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Churches. For there were many erroneous, diſorderly, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding and lukewarm Perſons in both the Jewiſh and Chriſtian Churches in their Days, as well as now. Yea, more ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Chriſt himſelf the Holy One of God muſt have been pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted by his joining in Communion with the Jewiſh Church, and chargeable with all the ſcandalous and abominable Sins of that People, who were the greateſt Part of them open Sinners or ſecret Hypocrites. For he punctually attended their religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Worſhip and Feaſts at Jeruſalem. He never ſeparated from their Communion. But he uſed all lawful Means to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim them, and bore due Teſtimony againſt their falſe Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines and wicked Practices. In following his Example we are ſafe. In forſaking it there is Danger.</p>
                     <p>Do we hinder you to follow any of the Methods which God has preſcribed to you in his Word in reproving any ſcandalous Offender in our Churches, or in tabling a Complaint againſt him, or in bearing Teſtimony againſt every Thing that is wrong in a chriſtian Manner?</p>
                     <p>As to the Scriptures which the various Kinds of Separatiſts from true Churches quote to juſtify them in their Separations having been ſo lengthy already I have not Room at preſent to examine them particularly. Nor is there any great Need— God erected his viſible Church among the Jews, and at length choſe Jeruſalem for the chief Seat of his public Worſhip to which he commanded them all to repair. This Church he maintained and erected no other till after the Reſurrection of Chriſt. Hence it is certain, there can be no Precept, nor any Example that God approved of to juſtify Separation from the Jewiſh Church, or any true Church during this Period. The Old-Teſtament and the four Goſpels, can be Nothing to the Purpoſe of the Separatiſts. Yet there were many Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:009120_0112_1030F37E850C7330"/>
during this Period. King Jeroboam withdrew from the Jewiſh Church, and ſet up two Separate Meetings, one at Dan and another at Bethel, and many induced partly by his Authority, and partly by their own Inclination, followed his Example. But he and they ſtand on Record in the Scriptures ſtigmatized as wicked Schiſmaticks to all Generations. The Samaritans ſet up another Separate Meeting at Mount Geriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zim: But our bleſſed Lord expreſsly condemned them as Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, and as worſhipping they knew not what.</p>
                     <p>We find as little to countenance Separations from a true Church where no unſcriptural Terms of Communion are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, in the Acts of the Apoſtles and their other Writings as in the preceding Part of the Bible. It appears from their Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that there were many Diſorders, Corruptions and Back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidings in the primitive Churches before the Apoſtles died. An Antichriſtian Spirit had even then begun to work. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe Things they were ſtill true Churches of Chriſt, and owned by him as ſuch. He had not forſaken them, but held their Stars in his right Hand, and walked in the midſt of the Golden Candleſticks. And ſince this was the Caſe, can any Man be ſo weak as once to imagine, that he allowed or required any of his People to ſeparate from the Communion of thoſe Churches. Hence it is plain that they muſt pervert all and every Tex of Scripture which they quote to juſtify Separations from the regular ſtanding Churches in the Country; ſince ſuch Paſſages are only Exhortations to Chriſtians to keep themſelves from the Sins and Corruptions that prevail in their Day, and not to countenance others in their Errors and wicked Practices, all which may be done without withdrawing from their Communion; or at moſt to ſeparate from thoſe Churches where there are new and unſcriptural Term of Communion impoſed and all other Methods of obtaining Redreſs prove unſucceſsful. In ſuch a Caſe it is readily acknowledged that Chriſt has commanded his Diſciples to <q>ſtand faſt in the Liberty wherewith he has made us free,</q> and he juſtified his Diſciples in diſregarding the Rites, Ceremonies, Inventions and Traditions of the Phariſees and Elders. And then the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous Impoſers are the blameable Schiſmaticks. A major Party in a Church may act inconſiſtent with the Principles of Liberty and play the Tyrant. And if they do, and thus
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:009120_0112_1030F37E850C7330"/>
compel the Minor to withdraw by their unſcriptural Impoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Tyranny, the Sin and Guilt of the Schiſm will lie at their Door. However a Minor Party ſhould not be raſh in withdrawing and ſetting up another Church. It is agreeable to the Scriptures and the Example of the Apoſtles, Acts xv. to ſubmit the Matter in Conteſt to the Deciſion of proper and Impartial Judges. This valuable Privilege and important Branch of Chriſtian Liberty is ſecured to our Churches by our excellent Conſtitution as well as granted in the New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But it is incompatible with that Sort of Government or rather Anarchy, that muſt neceſſarily prevail in the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſeparate Aſſemblies. Hence their various Confuſions, Contentions, and ſometimes Excommunications of one another, and Separations from Separations. For indeed their indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Notions of Church Government and Practice upon them are equally inconſiſtent with the Liberty of particular Members, Common Senſe and Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But ſince we don't oblige any of our Members to approve any Thing that is Evil, nor to condemn any Thing that is Good; ſince we don't impoſe any unſcriptural Terms of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion on any Perſon; nor hinder nor forbid any to live in moſt exact Conformity to the Rules of the Goſpel in all God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and Honeſty; let thoſe who on one Pretence and another go on and perſiſt in ſeparating, know they muſt be reputed Schiſmaticks, and involve themſelves in all the Sin, Guilt, Danger, and Puniſhment which awaits thoſe who without Cauſe, divide, rend and tear to Pieces the Church of God, the beloved Spouſe of Jeſus Chriſt, whom he hath redeemed with his own Blood. This Sin and Guilt would doubtleſs be dreadful, though the Separations proceed from merely a proud, ambitious and contentious Spirit. But certainly it muſt great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aggravate the Guilt and Puniſhment, if ſuch Perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides Pride and Ambition are alſo influenced by a Love to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Errors. In ſuch a Caſe they muſt in an awful Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner be laying Stumbling Blocks in the Way of the blind, and hardening Sinners in their wicked Ways, to their eternal Ruin. Now if this be the Caſe with the various Sects of Separatiſts againſt whom I am writing, I leave it to be ſeriouſly conſidered, Whether any who directly or indirectly aid, aſſiſt and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:009120_0113_1030F38017BC7638"/>
them in their Separations ſhall eſcape with Impunity, when a jealous God makes Enquiry?</p>
                     <p>The Falſhood and bad Tendency of their Principle about immediate Impulſes, Revelations, &amp;c. which is the great Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, the Life and Soul of all their Schemes, has been clearly demonſtrated. And it is eaſy to ſhew that their other Antino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian Fancies which have been more briefly glanced at, are equally falſe and pernicious. How Things appear to others I ſhall not pretend to ſay. But it appears plain to me from ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Year's Obſervation, that the natural, corrupt Diſpoſition of Sinners to depart from God, neglect the Duties of Religion, and indulge their ſinful Luſts with Greedineſs, has been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kept in Countenance and ſtrengthened by the Clamours of Separatiſts, the Prejudices they have infuſed into People's Minds againſt the Ordinances of the Goſpel, and the Influence of their falſe Principles.</p>

And don't many ſuffer themſelves to be ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced by their noiſy Clamours as to forget their baptiſmal Vows? They zealouſly maintain that the viſible Church muſt conſiſt only of ſincere Saints, and that God does not require, but forbid unconverted Sinners to attempt the performance of any religious Duty, and that it is one of the greateſt Sins, if not the unpardonable Sin for any who are not ſincere Believers to attend the Sacraments. Hence when a Man has attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:009120_0113_1030F38017BC7638"/>
to pray whom they looked on to be unconverted, ſundry of them have been known immediately to withdraw, probably leſt they ſhould countenance him in ſuch a ſinful Practice.</p>
                     <p>The Conſequence which naturally follows from ſuch Prici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples is that unconverted Sinners ſhould not regard Religion at all, but live as they pleaſe. For if they may not lawfully attempt to perform religious Duties, and wait upon God for his Grace in the beſt Manner they can; if it be really ſo, that God has abſolutely forbidden them to read, hear, pray, medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, attend Sacraments, &amp;c. without the higheſt Kind of Faith; then they muſt firſt know they are converted and have this ſaving Faith. Otherwiſe they will do what according to this Scheme God has not directed nor required, which would be Preſumption. Dreadful is the Curſe which God has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt thoſe who make any Additions to his written Word, and do what he has not commanded.—On this Scheme there can be no public Worſhip nor Sacraments at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended at all. For there are not a ſufficient number of aſſured Chriſtians ordinarily living ſo contigous as would anſwer for this End.</p>
                     <p>They will allow perhaps when pinched with an Argument that unconverted Sinners are under Obligations to ſerve God by vertue of his Law. But if they would be conſiſtent with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, they muſt own that unconverted Sinners are obliged on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as the Devils are. But the Law which God has revealed to Mankind in his Word is the Law of Chriſt. It is ordained in the Hand of a Mediator. And Men had perhaps as good neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Duties altogether as perform them without any Reference to Chriſt the Mediator. If any ſhould think the Devils are bound to pray to God, yet ſurely they can't imagine they are bound to pray to him in the Name of Chriſt which is the Way which God has preſcribed to Mankind in his Word. So that ſuch Notions directly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>Some endeavour to ſupport themſelves in their Errors and others in their Sins from the Doctrine of Predeſtination, ſaying if they are elected they ſhall be ſaved, let them be ever ſo wicked.

                     <p>Some Ignorant Perſons infer with John Lewis, that if the Doctrine of Predeſtination be true, then Moral Agency is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and they ſo compelled to act, that they are not to blame for their Sins.

Let thoſe who diſlike the 17th of the famous 39 Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, explain this Text and Fact fairly at their Leiſure. Let Men's Conſciences be thoroughly awakened, and they will find with John Lewis, that ſuch Refuge will fail them. They will then ſee, that as the Decrees of God were ſecret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them, ſo they never indulged their ſinful Luſts with any View to fulfil them: and conſequently that it is utterly vain to attempt to throw the Blame of their Sins on the wiſe, juſt and holy Decrees of the bleſſed God.</p>
                     <p>God has made the reprobate as well as his Elect. The Non-Elect are his Subjects as well as the Elect. The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of God which are the Rule of Conduct are given to both without Diſtinction. And all are bound to obey them. So that it is contrary to all the Commands of God to ſuppoſe that Men ſhould not attempt to ſerve God till they know they have the Faith of God's Elect.</p>
                     <p>The Means of Grace and the Ordinances of the Goſpel, are not given to the Elect as ſuch, becauſe they live promiſcuouſly among the Non-Elect, and are unknown to the World. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are the Means of Grace appointed for ſincere Believers as ſuch, becauſe they are deſigned for the Conviction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of Sinners, as well as the Edification of Saints. <hi>Faith comes by Hearing.</hi> Beſides, it cannot be certainly known who are ſincere Believers. Men cannot ſearch the Heart. It fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows then, that the Means of Grace are given to the viſible Church, to viſible Believers or Chriſtian Profeſſors and their Seed. Thus Moſes inſtructed of Old. Thus Iſrael underſtood and
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:009120_0114_1030F38717E10D68"/>
practiſed. Yet the Doctrine of Election was as true, and the Neceſſity of ſaving Faith as great then as it is now. Chriſt and his Apoſtles preached to Sinners and Saints, and commanded them to take Heed how they heard. And when the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Peter looked on Simon Magus to be unconverted, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected him to repent and pray. There is no Doubt but Faith was implied in this Repentance and Prayer. For God requires Perfectneſs and Sincerity of Heart in every Duty. But the Queſtion here is this, and this only, ſhould not Simon Magus attempt to pray till he knew he had ſaving Faith? Did Peter give any Intimation to him that he might neglect Prayer, or that he ought not to pray at all while he continued in the Gall of Bitterneſs? Was not Simon Magus's Perverſneſs a principal Part of his Inability? And is not this in ſome Senſe the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency of unconverted Sinners? If it is, I muſt be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to aſk. Whether it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that God does not require Sinners to perform Duties, becauſe they are very averſe to his Service? Will this Plea be a ſufficient Excuſe for their Ungodlineſs?</p>
                     <p>If Sinners are taught that they may not do any Duty 'til they know they have ſaving Faith, and are elected, left it ſhould be of no Advantage to them; this cannot well fail to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in their Sins, and make them very eaſy in that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of Religion which is ſo natural to them. Then it will alſo follow that they act very reaſonable, when according to their Cuſtom they carefully ſtrive againſt all Convictions of Sin, and to get rid of all Awakenings and ſerious Impreſſions as ſoon as poſſible. For they will, with Paul <note n="f" place="bottom">Acts ix. 11. compared with Rom. vii.</note> in the like Caſe, be earneſt in Prayer, while they have any ſerious Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on their Minds. If ſerious Convictions be, as the <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vians</hi> teach, a great Obſtacle to hinder Men from believing in Chriſt, then the more ſecure and ſinful they are, the more likely to get Faith and Salvation. Such Notions may be advanced with a Pretence of exalting the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and the Glory of free Grace; and they may be greedily imbibed by the unwary. But they appear to me the greateſt Affront that can be offered to Chriſt, a monſtrous Perverſion of his Attonement, as if Chriſt had died <hi>to render impenitent Sinners accepted unto everlaſting Life,</hi> and thus excuſe them from Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and religious Duties. For don't ſuch Notions make

Chriſt the Miniſter of Sin with a Witneſs? I am bold to ſay that ſuch Principles reduced to Practice will land in Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But I hope the Hearts of ſome Antinomians are better than their Heads.</p>
                     <p>Be that as it may, I am certain of this that ſuch Notions are not to be found in the Bible. When God promiſes to <q>give Iſrael a new Heart, and a new Spirit, and to take away the ſtony Heart, and give them an Heart of Fleſh," he adds, "I will yet <hi>for</hi> this be enquired of by the Houſe of Iſrael to do <hi>it</hi> for them.</q> God expreſsly commanded ſpeaking to the Wicked and Unrighteous, <q>Seek ye the Lord, while he may be found, call ye upon him, while he is near.</q> He appeals to Men's own Reaſon and Conſcience on this Point, when he aſks, "Should not a People ſeek unto their God?" Did not God approve of the Conduct of the Ninevites in cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mightily unto him? Was not their Conduct more pleaſing to God, than if they had neglected Prayer, and gone on har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in their Sins? But who will ſay they all had the higheſt Kind of Faith. Such Principles are not agreeable to Paul's Experiences, Rom. vii. not to his Writings. He never taught that Sinners ſhould do Evil that Good may come. But they are agreeable to the Principles and Practice of another Sort of People. <note n="g" place="bottom">Job. xxi. 14, 15.</note> 
                        <q>they ſay unto God. Depart from us, for we deſire not the Knowledge of thy Ways. What <hi>is</hi> the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, that we ſhould ſerve him? And what Profit ſhall we have if we pray unto him?</q> There are many ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings in the Hearts of ungodly Men. And no Wonder, ſince they don't love God nor his Law, and would fain be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from Duty, and yet hope they ſhall have Peace though they gratify their ſinful Luſts. But God expreſsly declares, that all ſuch Notions and Speeches are againſt him. <note n="h" place="bottom">Mal. iii. 13 15. Ezek. xiii. 22. Matt xxv. 24, 30.</note> 
                        <q>Your Words have been ſtout againſt me, ſaith the LORD; yet ye ſay, What have we ſpoken <hi>ſo much</hi> againſt thee? Ye have ſaid, It <hi>is</hi> vain to ſerve God: and what Profit <hi>is it,</hi> that we have kept his Ordinance and that we have walked mournfully before the LORD of Hoſts. And now we call the Proud happy: Yea, <hi>they that</hi> work Wickedneſs are ſet up; yea they that tempt God are even delivered.</q> It is not Truth but <q>Lies that Strengthen the Hands of the Wicked, that he ſhould not return from his Wicked way,

by promiſing him Life.</q> It was the ſlothful Servant who hated to take ſuitable Pains in improving his Talent, who wickedly and impudently imagined he could throw the Blame on his Maſter, and pied that his Lord was an hard and auſtere Man.</p>
                     <p>Sinners if they ſhould cry to their utmoſt to Eternity can do nothing at all towards working out a juſtifying Righteouſneſs, nor can they ever create themſelves a new in Chriſt Jeſus unto Good Works. And where does God command them to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Duties either before or after Faith with ſuch Views? How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſince they are ſo ignorant and ſo proud as not to know their own Weakneſs, 'till they have fully tried the Way of Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation by Men's own Works, tho' it has been blocked up ſince Adam's Time ſo that no Man ever obtained Acceptance in that Way. Yet it remains recorded and plainly deſcribed in the Scripture, that none may forſake it, 'till they find by their own Experience they muſt leave and renounce it, or periſh.</p>
                     <p>But tho' Sinners are prone from their Ignorance and Pride to take this antiquated Path, and ſo to oppoſe Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs, how does it follow, that it is the Deſign of the Spirit in convincing Sinners to build them up in Self-Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs? Or that what the Sinner does under his enlightning and convincing Influences has any ſuch Tendency? The very Reverſe is true. For theſe Operations of the Spirit, and the Sinners finding his Attempts to eſtabliſh a juſtifying Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all in vain, is one great Thing, that brings him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce Self Righteouſneſs. And this may be done in a great Meaſure before the Sinner ſees Jeſus Chriſt and his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; yea, in many, who never have a ſaving Diſcovery of Chriſt at all. If it be aſked what ſupports the Sinner at ſuch a Time? I anſwer we are apt to impoſe on ourſelves by meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical Terms. What ſupports the Multitude of profane Sinners, of Heathens, &amp;c. Is it their own Righteouſneſs? or Chriſts? They are equally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eſtitute of both. What ſupports them then? If this Queſtion has any Meaning, it muſt be this when ſtripped of Metaphor, How do they live along? or what defends them from the Fears of the Wrath to come? The true Anſwer to it then is <hi>Forgetfulneſs</hi> of God and <hi>Security</hi> are their principal Support. Sinful Luſt and Fooliſh Vanities divert many. The Cares of the World employ the Thoughts of Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes. In Reality Chriſtleſs Sinners receive leſs Support from their own Righteouſneſs than from a Hundred other Things.
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:009120_0116_1030F38A9206C2E8"/>
Neither Scripture nor Reaſon prove that all Chriſtleſs Sinners conſtantly truſt in their own Righteouſnes, or that their is any Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in the Nature of Things that they ſhould always really deſign to work out a juſtifying Righteouſneſs by attending on the Means of Grace. If Sinners could improve their Talents, the Means of Grace, while they remain in a State of Nature to no other Purpoſe than to build up a Righteouſnes of their own, in Oppoſition to Chriſt's, I think it is very ſtrange that the Holy Spirit ſhould ever convince and awaken them, which always puts them on earneſt Seeking and Striving. For every Attempt of a Sinner to attain Juſtification or become righteous before God by his own Works, and much more, every Imagination that God will aſſiſt him in any ſuch Attempt muſt be criminal in Man, and carries in it a diſhonourable Reflexion on the Moſt High. So that the Spirit can never be ſent to put Men on any ſuch La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. It is likewiſe evident, that if Sinners muſt neceſſarily in all and every Thing that they perform, deſign, and actually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to build up their own Self-Righteouſneſs; the Lord would never have condemned the Servant for not improving his Talent. For as good fit idle, as do what is worſe than No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Better not build at all, than to build what muſt be all thrown down; unleſs ſuch fooliſh Attempts and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have ſome Tendency to teach the Man more Senſe in coming Time. If all a Man's Attempts, even under ſerious Convictions, to wait upon God for his Grace, to attend on Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, &amp;c. only lead him to build up in more hidden and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and conſequently in more dangerous Methods, his own Righteouſneſs in Oppoſition to Chriſt's, he had better neglect Duties than perform them. Moſt certainly God will never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Men for not bring more diligent and laborious in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their own Works for a juſtifying Righteouſneſs, in Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the glorious Righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Yet it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, the ſlothful Servant in the Parable was condemned for his Idleneſs and Miſimprovement of his Talent. Which ſhews, that Sinners ſhould improve their Advantages and Means of Grace, and not truſt in their Duties; and that this is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in the Nature of Things. Such as talk otherwiſe, give but too much Reaſon to ſuſpect that they are ignorant of the Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminations of the Holy Spirit, and the Way in which Men are brought to renounce their own Righteouſneſs; or at leaſt that they have not duly attended to what has paſſed in their Minds.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="213" facs="unknown:009120_0116_1030F38A9206C2E8"/>That ſuch Principles have a Tendency to Irreligion is evident from plain, undeniable Matters of Fact. While the Quakers deny both the Sacraments, and the Separatiſts repreſent it as the moſt horrible Sin for Men to attend upon them without Faith. Is not the Lord's Supper generally neglected? While ſome from the ſame Principle diſpute, or at leaſt ſcruple whether there is any Advantage in unconverted Men's attending on the Means of Grace, and performing any religious Duties, have not ſome begun to leave off both praying and hearing? Is not Remiſſneſs in attending the Means of Grace a growing Practice in the Country? People have become ſlack and indifferent in aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling themſelves together "to worſhip the King the Lord of Hoſts, and to keep the Feaſt of Tabernacles," the Lord's-Supper. And the Lord has been fulfilling his Threatning upon this Land in an awful Manner, commanding that there ſhould be no Rain upon us for ſome Months in the Summer. <note n="*" place="bottom">1761.</note> Let every One then renounce his erroneous Principles, and fooliſh and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Practices, and ſearch the Scriptures, and adhere to the pure Goſpel of Chriſt, and ſeriouſly and diligently attend on all the Duties of Religion and Means of Grace; leſt God's Anger ſhould not be turned away, but his Hand be ſtretched out ſtill.</p>
                     <p>God has eternal as well as temporal Judgments to execute on diſobedient Sinners. Temporal Judgments may be removed. But except Sinners repent and believe the Goſpel in the true Import of it, and bring forth the Fruits of Holineſs, they ſhall all ſurely periſh, and never ſee the Lord in Mercy. <q>As for ſuch as turn aſide unto their crooked Ways, the LORD ſhall lead the forth with the Workers of Iniquity.</q>

                     <p>Upon the Whole, I muſt therefore earneſtly recommend to you the Advice of the wiſe Man, <q>Ceaſe my Son to hear the Inſtruction that cauſeth to err from the Words of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</q> And to engage your ſolemn Attention to the Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I have now given you, I muſt leave with you thoſe Words of his in another Caſe not quite unlike this under Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. <q>Hear me now therefore O ye Children, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part not from the Words of my Mouth leſt thou mourn at the laſt, when thy Fleſh and thy Body are conſumed; And ſay, how have I hated Inſtruction, and my Heart deſpiſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof?

                  <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
                  <p>IT does not appear to me that I have much to hope from the the Applauſes, or to fear from the Cenſures of the World; and therefore have made it my Buſineſs to repreſent and defend what appears to me to be Truth. Since I have written freely, tho' not raſhly, on ſundry Points, it will be no Diſappointment to me to find that many will not be pleaſed with what I have ſaid. Such may remember, I have as much Right to differ from them, as they have to differ from me; and they may, if they pleaſe publiſh their Sentiments to the World as I have done.</p>
                  <p>As my Connexions with a particular Company gave Riſe to what I have written, ſo I have endeavoured to confute their Notions, &amp; obviate their Objections; otherwiſe I could not have anſwered my own Deſign, nor acted with tolerable Propriety; yet I have endeavoured to ſtrike at the Root of Enthuſiaſm, that ſo the Addreſs may be of ſome Service againſt it in general.</p>
                  <p>If the Errors I have written againſt were trifling, or ſuch as No body ever embraced, or attended with no bad Conſequences, I ſhould not have taken ſo much Pains to expoſe them. Yet many are not aware of any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger here. To convince ſuch, I have reprinted an Account of John Lewis, and the Dutartres. Theſe Accounts were ſhort, they ſuited my Purpoſe, they were publiſhed before. I gave them juſt as I found them. But leſt ſome ſhould imagine that only ſuch weak and ignorant Perſons were in Danger of following ſuch Impulſes and Revelations, I have inſerted ſome others, particularly that ſurpriſing Incident in the Life of Lord Herbert, who was a Man of great natural Parts, and had made conſiderable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments in Learning.—I will add here, that there is Nothing which is a greater Bar in hindring the Jews from embracing Chriſtianity, than the Regard they pay to their Oral Law, and their Spiritualizings, or Allegorical Interpretations of the Old-Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>The Addreſs is much longer than I had intended, becauſe I have been obliged to diſcuſs ſundry Things that fell in my Way, which I had not particularly tho't of when I began to write. To prevent its being long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, I have been obliged to be ſo <hi>Iaconic</hi> on ſeveral Things, that I ſhall he glad, if ſundry Readers don't miſtake my Meaning. Some who are acquainted with thoſe againſt whom I have immediately written, will be ready to think, I have treated them with too much Lenity. But in this I have endeavoured to follow the Scripture Directions, not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Railing for Railing, but in Meekneſs inſtructing thoſe that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves; if God peradventure will give them Repentance to the acknowledging the Truth.</p>
