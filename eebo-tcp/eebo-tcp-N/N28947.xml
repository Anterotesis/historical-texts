            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>CUSTOM has long eſtabliſhed the right of dramatiſts to a property in the plots and characters of noveliſts; and recent inſtances might be adduced of novels and romances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which were ſcarcely ſuffered to be read, ere they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted into dramas.</hi>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> treſpaſſes upon dramatic ground cannot be conteſted: whether the</hi> exerciſe <hi>of that right, in the preſent inſtance, will be as favourably received by the public, their voice can alone determine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As there may be thoſe, however, who acceding the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of right, yet marvel at the author's taſte in the ſelection or ſo hacknied a ſubject, he begs leave to ſtate the motive of his choice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Having been ſo fortunate, as to be preſent at Mrs. Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons's performance of Milwood, he was ſo agreeably ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the novel, yet juſt colouring, which that lady's incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable talents gave to a character, till then deemed inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant, that he determined, perhaps raſhly, upon the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Such readers, as have ſeen Milwood perſonated in the uſual manner</hi> only, <hi>will conclude, that the copy attempted in the following ſheets, differs too much from the vulgar open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of character they have been accuſtomed to aſſociate with the original. Such as have ſeen Mrs. Siddons's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, will, he humbly conceives, form a contrary opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion: and he reſts perfectly at eaſe as to the deciſion of the beſt judges reſpecting the preference he has yielded to</hi> her <hi>delineation of Milwood, whoſe moſt extraordinary powers are only equalled by the juſt diſcrimination, which directs their diſplay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The author has deviated in ſeveral inſtances from the ſtory he has adopted; has introduced ſome new characters, and changed the features of others; yet as the chief incidents are preſerved, he thought it more candid to retain the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal title, than to invent a new one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Of his own production, he would only obſerve, that he</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <hi>the deſign is novel, and reſpectfully ſubmits it to the world, merely as the exerciſe of a mind ſomewhat contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative, in thoſe evening hours of leiſure, which the duties of a humble deſtination in life occaſionally afford him; and by no means as the effort of a competitor for literary fame.</hi>

               <p>THE eye that has witneſſed the peaceful depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a juſt man's ſpirit in the preſence of affectionate relatives, and revering friends, has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held a ſpectacle ſolemnly delightful, and awfully in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting, beyond all power of deſcription.—On ſuch occaſions the heart truſts not to the tongue's feeble utterance, but ruſhing to the countenance, there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineates its emotion in a language without words. Such was the ſcene at the rectory of Hanworth: its worthy incumbent had heard with reſignation, the opinion of his phyſician, that no human means could ſave him. Mortification had advanced almoſt to it's laſt ſtage. Yet, though he felt no pangs of guilt, no dread of future worlds, though perfectly reſigned to die, there were attractions, whoſe reſiſtleſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> force ſtill held his wiſhes for a longer life—Around that couch, from which he never was to riſe, knelt objects that had awakened in his breaſt, the fineſt feelings of an huſband, father, friend.</p>
               <p>The amiable woman, who at an early age had given him her hand, and with it the worthieſt of hearts, too deeply afflicted to weep, gazed alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:038596_0007_10129E16F1D3BCC0"/>
on her expiring husband, and on thoſe, who were ſo ſoon to be the orphan pledges of his love, with the ſoul-piercing wildneſs of deſpair.</p>
               <p>Their ſon, a youth of ſixteen, held his father's hand claſped firmly betwixt both his own, and bent his face over it to conceal his tears.</p>
               <p>A daughter, ſomewhat younger, with tears and ſwelling ſighs mingled ejaculations to the Deity to ſpare a life ſo dear.</p>
               <p>Leaning his head againſt the feet-poſts of the bed ſtood Dr. Hill, the benevolent friend and ſkilful phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of the rector, whoſe ſerene countenance he appeared contemplating with pleaſure.</p>
               <p>"I could have wiſhed he had arrived—I ſhould have retired from the ſcenes of this life with leſs regret, had I committed theſe my only cares to his kind keeping" faintly uttered Mr. Barnwell. "But his own good heart," continued he, "will ſuggeſt to him all I could have ſaid."</p>
               <p>It was his brother to whom he alluded, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the room as he was ſpeaking. His appearance changed the ſcene.—Mrs. Barnwell, Eliza, and George, clung round his knees, and ſeemed to hail him as the meſſenger of joy: but it was a momentary joy. Sir James had been anxiouſly expected, and his arrival as it ended that anxiety, occaſioned a momentary impulſe of pleaſure. But no ſooner did the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly cauſe of his viſit recur, than ſilence and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row enſued.</p>
               <p>Sir James, after a pauſe, approached his dying brother, and an affecting farewell took place. Tears rolled down the pallid cheek of the worthy rector, as he preſſed his brother's hand, and caſt a meaning look upon his family. He ſunk exhauſted on his pillow.</p>
               <p>"Think of this world no more, my brother," ſaid Sir James: "from this moment this is my wife—theſe are my children—and all I have is their's!"</p>
               <p>"My God! I thank thee," exclaimed the Rector and expired.</p>

                  </gap> that—"we muſt all die,"—that "our loſs is the gain"—that "ſorrow is uſeleſs, and tears cannot reſtore them to us."</p>
               <p>Sometimes it happens that Prudence ſteps kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in with ſome ſuch counſel as this—"that though a huſband, or a father, is gone, it is a comfortable conſideration that his widow or his children enjoy the fruits of his induſtry and oeconomy; and that, inſtead of grieving for a calamity that is paſt, it were better to rejoice in the bleſſings that remain."</p>
               <p>Such are the reflections that ſooth the breaſts of many an heir, and many a widow, beneath the ſable ſhew of ſorrow; who oft times by their cheerful countenance, wiſely endeavour to diſſipate the gloom occaſioned by the eſcutcheon that darkens the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of their ball room, and the black equipage that conveys them to the opera—
<q>
                     <l>Thus bear about the mockery of woe</l>
                     <l>To midnight dances and the public ſhow.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The family of the Barnwells, inheriting from the rector little elſe than his good name, were in no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of inſulting his memory by a joyful diſplay of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:038596_0009_10129E1E10726748"/>
his wealth; nor would their grief have been leſſened by the poſſeſſion of thouſands. Every branch of this bereaved family was ſenſible of the loſs it had ſuſtained, and felt, when the violence of grief was abated, a regret more calm indeed, but not leſs ſorrowful.</p>
               <p>Sir James was, perhaps, the individual among them who, poſſeſſing the leaſt ſenſibility, was the leaſt affected: not that the knight was deficient in thoſe feelings which are the honourable appendages of humanity, but he was older than Mrs. Barnwell by at leaſt ten years, and had ſpent the greater part of his life in a counting houſe, and on the Royal Exchange; which, though certainly the ſchools where induſtry may learn an honourable way to its rewards, cannot be deemed the moſt favourable ſoil for the growth of thoſe ſenſibilities which, though not virtues themſelves, are at leaſt Virtue's faithful allies.</p>
               <p>Sir James was the firſt, therefore, to call the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of his ſiſter-in-law from the tomb which held her affections, to thoſe duties which ſhe owed to ſociety, to her children, to herſelf.</p>
               <p>"I am a lone man," ſaid the knight, "and, by the bleſſing of heaven upon honeſt endeavours, have accumulated more than I ſhall ever ſpend. My brother, I know, accumulated in another way—his ſtock was the treaſure of the mind—a proper poſſeſſion, doubtleſs, for a clergyman, but for which his heirs are little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing the better.</p>
               <p>"After the loſs you have ſuſtained, my ſiſter," continued the night, "I am ſure your inclination is to quit this place as ſoon as poſſible. I inſiſt on a viſit to my old manſion, where we may leiſurely diſcuſs the plan I have in contemplation to make us all happy."</p>
               <p>A propoſal ſo perfectly congenial to her wiſhes was readily accepted by Mrs. Barnwell, and a day was named for their departure; but whilſt herſelf and Eliza impatiently deſired that day's arrival, George deprecated its approach. To quit for ever his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive home—coſt his young heart—which was the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:038596_0010_10129E2227E71298"/>
ſhrine of ſenſibility—ſome ſtruggles. Among the various objects that called reflection to its pleaſing painful taſk, there ſtood in the centre of the garden a ſmall temple, built in the Gothic ſtyle, and dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to retirement. This was conſtructed under the direction of George himſelf, and was the favourite retreat of the rector. To this place young Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well would frequently retire, where memory would rehearſe to him thoſe leſſons, to which he had often liſtened with reverent attention—and, aided by fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, would place his father's countenance and form before him.—As he ſtrolled round the grounds, in one place a plant, in another ſome little monument with claſſical quotation, would remind him of the pleaſing-employment of his paſt hours.</p>
               <p>"Days of happineſs!—hours of hope!—farewell!" exclaimed the youth: "and you, ſweet home, where firſt the light of heaven beamed upon theſe eyes—farewell! Oh, you have cheated me, falſe Hope! How often has my ſainted father, too, added falſe prophecies to my deluſive tales! How often has he ſaid, 'When I am gone, my George, this plant ſhall ſpeak to you of me—this tablet ſhall remind my ſon—that he muſt alſo die!' and now, alas! ſome ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger's eye ſhall gaze indifferent upon theſe plants—ſome fool, perhaps, ſhall ſcoff at Wiſdom's leſſon—whilſt thoſe for whom they were deſigned, like the wanderers from Paradiſe, are even to explore an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known world!"</p>
               <p>Such really were the reflections of a youth of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen, incredible as they may appear to thoſe who judge of human nature, and it's faculties, by the ſame calculations as a ſurveyor values timber, its ſize and growth. Such perſons would deny the exiſtence of Chatterton.</p>

               <p>"Well, I don't know," ſaid Sir James; "ſuch things may be—ſpirits may walk. For my own part, I would neither obſtinately deny all belief in ſtories of this kind, nor would I implicitly believe all I hear. What thinks my nephew George; he ſmiles as if he would convey a ſort of contempt for things of this nature."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:038596_0012_10129E26EB371858"/>
George bluſhed deeply. He had not been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to ſpeak in ſo large, and reſpectable a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany as the knight's hoſpitality had aſſembled, and felt conſiderable embarraſſment in ſo new a ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He recovered himſelf, and, with ſome heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaid, "I confeſs, Sir, I have been taught to conſider ſtories of this deſcription as ridiculous."</p>
               <p>"Ridiculous!" exclaimed Mr. Sandall the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain—"ridiculous! young gentleman; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let me aſk, ridiculous?"</p>
               <p>"Becauſe, being irreconcileable to truth and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they are beneath the dignity of ſerious argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>
               <p>"It muſt be confeſſed, Mr. Sandall," ſaid the knight, "that theſe appearances are ſupernatural."</p>
               <p>"Allow me, to remark, Sir James," obſequiouſly ſaid Mr. Sandall, "that is no proof of their non-ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence; beſides, with all deference, I would aſk how we, whoſe ideas are ſo finite, can pretend to limit the operations of the Author of nature."</p>
               <p>And then raiſing his voice triumphantly, and fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſmall ſharp eyes on Barnwell—"I believe, young gentleman," interrupted he, "if you had ſeen the appearances theſe eyes have witneſſed, at the abbey, your courage would have fled with your incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity."</p>
               <p>George only bowed.</p>
               <p>A Miſs Lucas, a neighbouring maiden lady of fortune, could not ſuffer ſo charming a ſubject as ghoſts to be dropped ſo eaſily.</p>
               <p>"Surely, Sir," ſaid this lady to Barnwell, "you cannot preſume to put your opinion in competition with ſuch high authorities as Drelincourt on Death, and Dr. Johnſon. You will allow, I hope, there are ghoſts, though it may not have been your privilege to have ſeen them."</p>
               <p>"Without incurring the charge of vanity, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend," ſaid Barnwell, "that I may hold an opinion even againſt the greateſt authorities: for you will allow, that judgment ſhould yield to argument, not names.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:038596_0013_10129E29D7D8DBC0"/>
I have never beheld a ſpectre myſelf, and I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to attribute the narratives of thoſe, who ſay they have, to the influence of a weak or a warm imagination acted upon by accidental circumſtances."</p>
               <p>"It's rather ſingular, then," ſaid Mr. Sandall, "that the greater part of mankind ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſo long in error: for I conceive a majority believe in apparitions."</p>
               <p>"There cannot be a doubt of that, Mr. Sandall," ſaid Miſs Lucas. "This is termed an enlightened age; and pray, does not the popular opinion ſanction, almoſt excluſively, a novel, a romance, or a drama, where the prominent character is a ghoſt, or a daemon?"</p>
               <p>"And yet," replied Barnwell, "I cannot bring myſelf to conſider even this univerſal patronage as the conſequence of a general belief in ſpectres; unleſs it could be firſt proved, that the maſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are moſt delighted with known truths: whereas I conſider the chief ſource of the pleaſure in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſeeing ſuch unnatural productions, is, their remote diſtance from probability; which, creating a <hi>monſtrous novelty,</hi> excites the attention of thoſe, whoſe ſole aim is amuſement."</p>
               <p>"Pray, Sir," ſaid Miſs Lucas, "have you among other things been taught a knowledge of the holy <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"My father, Madam, was a clergyman," ſaid George, with a degree of warmth; "and I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the ſame holy office;" added he, with an emphatic ſigh.</p>
               <p>"Then, pray," ſaid Miſs Lucas, without feeling the rebuke, "do you believe the ſtory of the Witch of Endor?"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me," interrupted Sir James; "but it is a cuſtom I have eſtabliſhed at my own table, theſe thirty years, never to permit the diſcuſſion of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious or political ſubjects over the bottle. I beg leave, therefore, to propoſe a walk."</p>

               <p>WHY is curioſity moſt eaſily raiſed, or why moſt unquietly does it reſt, in the female breaſt?</p>
               <p>Eliza, whoſe modeſty did not permit her to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the company with her obſervations, yet treaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her memory all that had been ſaid concerning the abbey.</p>
               <p>When ſhe retired to her chamber, the windows of which commanded a view of the ruins, ſhe queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the ſervant who attended her concerning the ſtory of the haunted aiſle. The incongruous nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of Hannah ſerved only to increaſe her curioſity, and ſhe determined to pay a viſit to the abbey the following morning before breakfaſt.</p>
               <p>Sleep did not conquer the ſenſes of Eliza, that evening, with its uſual eaſe. She had extinguiſhed her candle, had whiſpered a prayer from the heart, and ſought repoſe. A ſlight ſlumber brought with it the following dream—</p>
               <p>"She had reached the abbey ruins, and was juſt entering the haunted aiſle, when a tomb which ſtood at the entrance ſeemed to rock at her approach. Whilſt heſitating whether to retire or advance, the tomb became enveloped in an aſcending vapour. In a moment the abbey ruins echoed the groans of one in the agonies of death; and as the vapour diſperſed, there appeared kneeling on the tomb a moſt beautiful female, naked to the waiſt. Her eyes were ſwollen with weeping, her hair was diſhevelled, and from her wounded breaſt blood trickled, whilſt her hands in vain attempted to remove a dagger, whoſe fatal point was buried in her boſom. Eliza's attention

to the ſpectre was ſo intenſe, that ſhe did not notice the form of a man who ſtood contemplating with ſmiles the agonies of the female, until the ſound of a harp, which he touched in a rapid manner, arouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her. His figure was handſome, his complexion a dark brown, and jet-black hair curled in ringlets on his forehead: his voice, which accompanied the harp, was melodious. Liſtening to his lively ſtrain, Eliza was ſmote with horror and aſtoniſhment at the following rhapſody.—</p>

               <p>Scarcely was the laſt ſtanza ſung, when the tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Eliza awoke from her dream; doubting for a conſiderable time, whether what ſhe had ſeen or heard was not reality. Juſt as ſhe had overcome the impreſſions ariſing from ſo horrible a viſion, the night wind wafted by the caſement of her chamber the tone of an inſtrument ſo ſimilar to thoſe ſhe had heard in fancy, that, ſtarting up in her bed, ſhe drew aſide the curtain, under an apprehenſion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, awake, the viſion of her ſleep.</p>
               <p>The chamber was in total darkneſs; but the ſame ſounds were repeated; and hearing them now more diſtinctly, her heart ſunk with terror at the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. She determined to quit her bed, and feeling her way to the window, opened it. The ſame ſounds
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:038596_0016_10129E32A4D96150"/>
were heard again, yet more diſtinctly, and ſhe was convinced they came from the abbey ruins. She bent her eyes towards the ſpot whence they iſſued: in a few moments all was ſilence, and ſhe beheld a lighted torch borne along the ruins, but the night was too dark to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Returning to her bed, terrified and aſtoniſhed, ſhe began to reaſon with her fears. That the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic was not imaginary ſhe was convinced; and that its influence, added to the impreſſion of Hannah's incoherent narrative, which bore a reſemblance to her dream, had occaſioned the viſion, ſhe no longer doubted: yet not leſs ſtrange appeared the reality than the viſion. For what purpoſe any one could ramble among the mouldering tombs of the abbey, ſhe had yet to learn. Fear, at length, gradually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired from her breaſt; but its moſt conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion Curioſity remained.</p>

               <p>"THERE is a very ſingular coincidence of your dream with the muſic you really heard," ſaid George to his ſiſter, who had unburdened her mind to him, according to her uſual practice. "Do you remember enough of the place you ſuppoſed was the abbey, to compare what you ſaw in your dream with the ruins themſelves?"</p>
               <p>"Beyond a doubt," ſaid Eliza.</p>
               <p>"We will take a ramble there in the evening," replied George; "and ſhould there be a tomb in the

old aiſle reſembling that in your dream, I think we ſhould relate the whole to Sir James. Murder," added he, "is a crime, above all others, offenſive to the Deity; and if ever the omnipotent, diſplays a miracle, I can conceive nothing more likely to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion his ſupernatural interference than detection of ſo foul a crime."</p>
               <p>They ſeparated. At dinner they joined a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous circle of the neighbouring gentry. It was the cuſtom of Sir James, once a year, to invite them all without exception. At other times he indulged his pleaſure in a ſelection. On this occaſion he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed his prejudices, and though himſelf a whig of the old ſchool, and a high church-man, there were at his table individuals of as various a caſt, as a circuit of ten miles round contained.</p>
               <p>Among theſe viſitors, there was one moſt oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the worthy knight in his principles and his manners, and whoſe reſidence was contiguous to Sir James's.</p>
               <p>By the oppoſite to a whig, uſed to be formerly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood a tory; and by the oppoſite to high-church, low-church was ſuggeſted. Now Mr. Mental was neither whig nor tory, nor a high, nor low church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; yet were his principles more at variance with Sir James than a Jacobite preſbyter's: the latter on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diffe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As his figure and dreſs were the moſt ſingular imaginable, they rendered him conſpicuous in all companies. He was of a large make, but thin; his face pale; his hair, a coal black, cropped ſhort in the neck; his dreſs, always the ſame, a ſuit of plain brown cloth. He would eat nothing that had ever enjoyed life; nothing in which ſugar was an ingredient; and his drink was water. He never ſmiled; and the only pleaſure he ever appeared to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ould conſtantly controvert the moſt allowed truths; delighted in attacking revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was indefatigable in diſcovering the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of his hearers on religious points</p>
               <p>The irremediable evils of ſociety were his deareſt topics, and the climax of his felicity was, by the abuſe of the eloquence he poſſeſſed, to render diſcontent triumphant.</p>
               <p>He had reſided in the neighbourhood many years, but ſaw no company at his own houſe, and very rarely accepted an invitation to any other: when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he did, it was his invariable cuſtom to ſingle out one from the younger part of a company, with whom he would abruptly begin a converſation.</p>
               <p>George and a young baronet, of one and twenty, were engaged in ſome trifling diſcourſe, when Mr. Mental tapped the latter on the ſhoulder, and aſked him if he had read a celebrated novel, much talked of.</p>
               <p>"I never read novels" ſaid the baronet.</p>
               <p>"Why not?" aſked Mr. Mental.</p>
               <p>"It is throwing away one's time, to ſay the beſt," replied the baronet. "I make a point never to read any thing of <hi>that</hi> ſort. I never read a novel in my life, and I never will: they're well enough for girls."</p>
               <p>"Prejudice—Prejudice—Prejudice—how art thou worſhipped in this iſle!" exclaimed Mr. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. "I ſuppoſe, then, you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"I make a point never to read works of <hi>that</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription; I underſtand its object is to turn every thing topſy-turvy; and I feel no ſort of inclination to be made giddy. I leave this ſort of thing to your revolutioniſts."</p>
               <p>"Prejudice again," cried Mental.—"Perhaps then, you dive into the mines of ſcience. You read—"</p>
               <p>"Oh, no, believe me, not I. I was obliged to

               <p>"I crave your pardon then," ſaid Mr. Mental. "Had I known you were in the poſſeſſion of ten thouſand a year, I ſhould by no means have ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you guilty of poſſeſſing a mind."</p>
               <p>"Is there no prejudice in that obſervation, Sir?" ſaid Barnwell, with a ſmile of modeſt diffidence.</p>
               <p>Mr. Mental, inſtead of anſwering, fixed a pair of large black eyes on George; and, folding his arms upon his breaſt, examined every feature of his countenance. After a conſiderable pauſe—</p>
               <p>"You, I believe, do not poſſeſs ten thouſand a year," cried he; "but if I am not much, indeed, deceived, you have materials of which a ſkilful artiſt might form a great mind. Allow me to aſk you—have you a father?"</p>
               <p>George gave an expreſſive look.</p>
               <p>"He has left you—Did I know him—was he of theſe parts?"</p>
               <p>George ſatisfied his curioſity.</p>
               <p>"Unfortunate!—unfortunate, indeed! contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Mental, "that ſuch materials ſhould have fallen into ſuch hands. You of courſe endeavour to compel your reaſon to adopt all thoſe doctrines which prieſtcraf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Sir," replied Barnwell, with the glow of indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation on his cheeks, "the honoured perſon to whom, without knowing him, you apply a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place epithet, never ſtrove to inſpire a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the breaſt of his children, to which the moſt enlightened reaſon could object."</p>
               <p>"You rejoice me," cried Mental—"You have not then imbibed the jargon of ſuperſtition, called religion."<note n="*" place="bottom">Some readers may deem it an impertinent interruption, if not an impeachment of their underſtandings, to be reminded "that the ſentiments which are put into the mouths of various perſonages in a novel, are for the illuſtration of their various characters, and ought never to be viewed in any other light." But the author would rather incur the blame of an unneceſſary interruption, than ſuffer the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of a ſuppoſition that it was his wiſh to <hi>diſſeminate</hi> principles, which it is his aim to <hi>deſtroy.</hi>

"Superſtition and religion in your dictionary then, are ſynonymous terms," cried Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"In the dictionary of truth they are ſo," replied Mental. "What is religion—but ceremony, or a ſet of ceremonies:—what are ceremonies, but ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition! For inſtance; how abſurd, how degrading to a human being, with faculties ſo comprehenſive that all nature bows before him, to which ſhe unfolds her ſecrets and ſubmits her laws—I ſay then it muſt be beneath the dignity of ſuch a creature to bend his knees, to bow his head, and mumble ſyllables of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities ſtrung together centuries ago, when, by the exerciſe of his own powers, he might be introduced into the arcana of great Nature herſelf."</p>
               <p>George replied—"The dignity of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Sir, is no new ſubject to me. My father taught it me truly, and exemplified his doctrines by his conduct. He taught me, Sir, that the dignity of our nature cannot be degraded by a public ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement of our obligations to the Author of nature, according to the cuſtoms and manners of our country; and that it is better to ſanction, by exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, even prejudices, which cannot be momentarily and ſafely removed, than by ridiculing thoſe inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the maſs of our fellow citizens hold ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, to give the reins to uncultivated nature."</p>
               <p>"There is a vein of independence in your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning I admire extremely, however much we may deviate in our concluſions," ſaid Mental.</p>
               <p>This introduction led to a long converſation, in which each ſeemed to take an intereſt. Mental appeared leſs and leſs diſguſting in the eyes of George, and George delighted old Mental, who expreſſed a wiſh that this would not be the laſt of their converſations.—</p>

               <p>"I believe I have thought too much about it," replied George. "To ſpeak candidly, I have been at no ſmall pains to make a match betwixt duty and inclination; but the latter receives the addreſſes of the former, even yet, but coolly."</p>
               <p>Mr. "Barnwell," ſaid Mental earneſtly, "as you value your happineſs for life, reflect—now is that important moment, in the period of your exiſtence, that will gild with pleaſure, or darken with diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, every ſcene as yet behind the veil of time.

               <p>A SUMMER day drew towards its cloſe—car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage after carriage had rolled away the well-pleaſed gueſts of the worthy knight; and ſilence once more reigned in the temple of hoſpitality.</p>

While Eliza, with a palpitating heart, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her brother to the haunted aiſle, the impreſſions of terror revived in her breaſt as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they entered the avenue from the park, which led directly to the ruins.—They were at the entrance of the aiſle—Eliza trembled—</p>
               <p>"Stay," ſaid George; "it is dark, and we are far from the houſe. A thought ſtrikes me—I have little dread of ghoſts—but it is not impoſſible that this retreat may be the rendezvous of beings leſs merciful, and more powerful, than mere ſpectres. Were we to be attacked, our loudeſt cries would reach no friendly ear.—Do you wait a moment behind this old column, and liſten attentively. I will go on. Should there be danger, you will hear my cries (they ſhall be loud enough) and immediately run as faſt as poſſible towards the houſe—it's a ſtraight road, and you cannot miſs it."</p>
               <p>When George had reſolved on any purpoſe, he always adhered to it. Remonſtrance on the ſcore of his perſonal danger was in vain, and the anxious Eliza clung round the pillar in trembling expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A few minutes elaſped—Eliza grew impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. A few minutes more paſſed away—no noiſe was heard—no brother returned. The whole ſpace of time was leſs than ten minutes—but how much longe it appeared in the reckoning of ſuſpenſe, is eaſily conceived.</p>
               <p>At length ſhe heard a diſtant ſound of footſteps;—it approached nearer—ſhe left her retreat, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to meet her brother; when a form, muffled in a long black cloak, and maſked, met her at the entrance of the aiſle. She ſcreamed—In an inſtant George was at her elbow; but the cauſe of her alarm was vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>"Surely I cannot be deceived?" ſaid George. "'Twas certainly a man—I ſaw him moſt diſtinctly. A black cloak and a maſk were lying on the very tomb you have deſcribed. As I approached it, a man, who was kneeling near it, ſtarted up, hurried
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:038596_0023_10129E46E8ECDA38"/>
on the cloak and maſk, and, preſented a piſtol, ſpoke theſe remarkable words—'I am diſcovered!' Ere I had recovered from my ſurpriſe he vaniſhed."</p>
               <p>"For heaven's ſake, my dear brother, let us quit this ſituation: it may be the abode of murderers," ſaid Eliza.</p>
               <p>They walked ſwiftly towards the houſe—"There are ſo many ſingular circumſtances combined in this adventure," ſaid George, "that I am determined to relate the whole affair to Sir James."</p>
               <p>It was late when they reached home; the family were aſſembled at ſupper, and the looks of Eliza an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the purpoſe of a preface to George's narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
               <p>"Now, young gentleman," ſaid Mr. Sandall, triumphantly, "I ſuppoſe you concede a little of your ſcepticiſm againſt apparitions.</p>
               <p>"Not a ſcruple," ſaid George.</p>
               <p>"What! will you allow nothing ſupernatural in the dream of Miſs Barnwell—nothing ſupernatural in the deſcription ſhe gives of the tomb ſhe never beheld?"</p>
               <p>"True" ſaid George, "ſhe never beheld this tomb; but Hannah has ſeen it, and in deſcribing it to my ſiſter, ſo impreſſed the image on her mind, that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> impoſſible to doubt the origin of her dream."</p>
               <p>"Did Hannah, too, impreſs her mind with the poem ſhe ſo well remembered?"</p>
               <p>"Hannah told me a confuſed ſtory, ſomething ſimilar in its circumſtances to thoſe in my dream," ſaid Eliza.</p>
               <p>"I have heard," ſaid Sir James, "ſtories of this nature frequently repeated; but, till now, I own, I never paid a ſerious attention to them. What has happened, however, determines me to take ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive meaſures towards unravelling the apparent myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. In the morning I will myſelf ſee the place, and examine its appearances."</p>
               <p>In the morning the knight, with a numerous train of attendants, ſallied forth to ſurvey the haunted

aiſle. He was ſupported on his right hand by the ſuperſtitious Mr. Sandall; on his left by Barnwell. A few armed domeſtics preceded them—Arrived at the entrance of the aiſle, Mr. Sandall pauſed.</p>
               <p>"If I might adviſe," ſaid he, "the ſervants, I conceive ſhould firſt ſearch the place, for they are armed."</p>
               <p>"But what are arms againſt incorporeal ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Mr. Sandall?" ſaid George. "Beſides, we can take the arms which the ſervants carry, who may wait here, and be within call, if their aſſiſtance is wanted."</p>
               <p>"Fooliſh ſcheme enough!" ſaid Sandall, terrified in no ſmall degree.</p>
               <p>"Suppoſe," continued George, "ſome daemon really tenants the old tomb, what do the ſervants know of exorciſing? Come, Sir, let us enter. I'll take this muſket, and if the inhabitants are formed of tangible ſtuff, a bullet may be uſeful, in caſe of attack; on the other hand, ſhould they be ſpiritual reſidentiaries, I ſhall turn them over to the diſcipline of the church."</p>
               <p>"Not ſo much levity," ſaid Sir James. "I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend no danger; but there's no telling—ſo go on, Joſeph we'll proceed—as we ſet out."</p>
               <p>Some minutes paſſed in the moſt profound ſilence. Nothing was heard, nothing was ſeen, that could juſtify the moſt diſtant conjecture. George could hardly refrain ſmiling, and in his heart exclaimed—<hi>"I would this ſolemn mockery were ended;"</hi> but his uncle's reproof was yet recent. At length—</p>
               <p>"Are you ſure you ſaw upon this tomb—this very tomb, a maſk and a cloak?" ſaid Sir James: "that you alſo ſaw a man kneel near this tomb—ſaw him riſe—put on the maſk and cloak—Are you perfectly convinced no part of this was imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?"</p>
               <p>"I am ſure I ſaw all that you have ſtated."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:038596_0025_10129E4D39051F48"/>
"'Tis very ſtrange!" ſaid Sir James.</p>
               <p>"Very ſtrange!" ſaid every one.—</p>
               <p>"Could not this tomb be moved?" ſaid George. "Where we in the foreſts of Germany, I ſhould be induced to think, from circumſtances, that it co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers the trap door of ſome ſubterraneous cavern."</p>
               <p>"Aye, Sir," ſaid Joſeph, an old domeſtic of the knight's, "you have hit the right nail on its head now. To be ſure its no buſineſs of mine; but if I were a magiſtrate—"</p>
               <p>"Hold your tongue, Joſeph—What would you do, if you were a magiſtrate?" ſaid the knight in a breath.</p>
               <p>"Why, might I be bold to ſpeak the truth, I do think murder lies hid under this here <hi>moniment;</hi> and if I was a magiſtrate, it ſhould be all pulled down, and dug under; and my life on it, but murder lies at the bottom."</p>
               <p>"That can't be done without the conſent of the owner," ſaid Sir James, "or ſome better grounds of ſuſpicion than we have at preſent."</p>
               <p>"Do you not own the ruins, Sir?" ſaid George.</p>
               <p>"Not this part of them," ſaid the knight. "All the land on this ſide the row of alder trees belongs to the next eſtate."</p>
               <p>"And who owns that?" aſked George.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Mental, the cynic you ſaw yeſterday. What do you ſtart at?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing, Sir," replied George, heſitating;—"but—Mr. Mental—is—a ſtrange man."</p>
               <p>"Ah, God forgive him, if all they ſay be true," cried old Joſeph, with an expreſſive ſhake of the head.</p>
               <p>"God can't forgive him," cried Sandall: "he's an atheiſt."</p>
               <p>"He is a ſingular man, undoubtedly," ſaid Sir James;" "and people will talk. Nobody, it ſeems knows who or what he is, or where he came from<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But I have heard old men, who remember his firſt coming here, whiſper ſtrange ſtories."</p>

George was ruminating—After another fruitleſs ſearch they returned home.</p>
               <p>A variety of conjectures preſented themſelves to the fertile imagination of George, all pointed to Mr. Mental. He now conceived, that the man he had ſeen the preceding evening was Mr. Mental. He imagined the voice he had heard reſembled Mr. Mental's, and built upon theſe impreſſions a ſuſpicion to the diſadvantage of his character. Quickly again his heart rebuked him for ſo illiberal a concluſion from a train of mere accidents. He recollected his invitation, and reſolved immediately to viſit him. Unwilling to awake thoſe ſuſpicions in the breaſt of another, which he was himſelf aſhamed of cheriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he determined to keep his viſit a ſecret from the family; and merely obſerved, that as he wiſhed to take a long ſtroll, it was doubtful if he ſhould return before evening.</p>

               <p>THE reſidence of Mr. Mental was a ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from Sir James's. It was a large old-faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed houſe, containing many rooms: of theſe only three were in uſe; one ſerved as a kitchen, and chamber for an old woman, his only domeſtic; a ſecond was a ſitting, eating, and ſleeping room of her maſter; and the third was a ſtudy.</p>
               <p>George rung a bell at the iron gate, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a plot of ground before the houſe, that was formerly a lawn. In its preſent neglected ſtate it
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:038596_0027_10129E52E2C71B50"/>
would be difficult to call it by any name that would convey an idea of its appearance.</p>
               <p>The above named old dame appeared at a window, and demanded the buſineſs of Barnwell. Having informed her maſter, George was admitted. Wad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through 'weeds moſt rank and wile,' he had at length found himſelf in the aforeſaid ſitting room, where Sarah told him her maſter would come to him.</p>
               <p>After ſome time moſt patiently occupied in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the motly furniture of the apartment, and a few ejaculations of ſurpriſe at ſo ſtrange a mode of life, George ventured to call old Sarah, and aſk if her maſter was particularly engaged; if ſo, he would take another opportunity of ſeeing him.</p>
               <p>"As to that, come when you will, he's always at his ſtudies," ſaid Sarah.</p>
               <p>"Shall I go to him?" ſaid George.</p>
               <p>"God forbid!" exclaimed Sarah—"Go into the ſtudy!—I have been here theſe twenty years, and no living ſoul but maſter has been in that ſtudy."</p>
               <p>Every moment the curioſity of George was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and he felt a great inclination to chat with Sarah concerning her maſter, when the original himſelf appeared. George gazed earneſtly at him as he entered, but could obſerve nothing in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that in the leaſt ſanctioned his ſuſpicions: there was no embarraſſment, but an air of ſolemn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſe, a kind of look that indicated a familiarity with grief.</p>
               <p>"And you are really come," exclaimed he. "Is it the ſpur of curioſity that has urged you to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance? Come, be honeſt, Sir. You wondered, doubtleſs, how an old fellow, like myſelf, could at firſt ſight be ſmitten with an attachment to your countenance. Sir, I have read the wondrous vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume of this world—I have been amongſt men—I have buſtled in the crowd. I have alſo been ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the herd; and in ſilent muſings of full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:038596_0028_10129E55DE280050"/>
a year I have contemplated the ſtrange variety of human nature—Perhaps there is no paſſion, no impulſe of the mind, that I have not experienced—Man is familiar to me—I know the whole machine—its movements—and the nature of the materials of which it is compoſed. Often by the countenance men are deceived. I may be ſo. If I am not, you have an honeſt mind; by which I mean, that you are ſincere; that your tongue utters what your heart prompts, and your reaſon dictates. Now tell me, Sir, what kind of man you think me."</p>
               <p>"Forming my judgment ſolely on appearances, I ſhould ſuppoſe you a diſappointed man; one whom misfortunes have induced to quarrel with the world."</p>
               <p>"The very notions I ſhould have entertained, had I ſeen my preſent reſemblance at your age: for then I viewed mankind through the ſame fairy teleſcope that you do now. Then my delighted fancy ſaw ſuch gueſts on earth, as Sympathy, Friendſhip, and Love; my heart hailed them for its own; it panted for inmates ſo neceſſary to its health and peace, and like you, I ſhould have thought that man unfortunate who miſſed the bliſs around him. But, <hi>"'tis deluſion all!"</hi> Apathy is the icy ruler of the hearts of men—intereſt deſtroys all ſocial union, and ſinks the maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter paſſion of the human ſoul below the appetites of brutes. Oh, young man, diſtruſt—diſtruſt thy fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; ſuſpect the tear of ſympathy, refuſe the hand of friendſhip; and ſhould ſome ſyren voice tell thee of love, fly from the ſerpent, that only charms to kill. There is no ſympathy; no friendſhip, no love amongſt the apoſtate race of man. Do I not know it—have I not felt it!—"</p>
               <p>The geſture that accompanied this apoſtrophe was that of the extremeſt anguiſh. George was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and Mental ſaw the emotion he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.</p>
               <p>"Nay, nay," ſaid he, "I mean not to inſinuate, that I am peculiarly wretched—'Tis the common lot—the deſtiny of man—to be deceived, to hope and
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:038596_0029_10129E58B0DB81E0"/>
be deceived again. Juſt as an infant who ſees the riſing bubble, that his breath has formed, burſt as it aſcends, will ſtill purſue another. But this is a ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre diſcourſe to a young man juſt ſtepping into life, and by no means the ſubject on which I wiſhed to ſpeak to you. You have received, I think, a liberal education."</p>
               <p>George here expatiated on the benefits he had received from the tuition of his father in moſt live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly colours.</p>
               <p>"Your father muſt have been a man of erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and not only ſo, but a man of taſte and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Do you imagine he would have approved of your entering into commercial concerns?"</p>
               <p>"His intentions were very oppoſite."</p>
               <p>"And I believe your inclinations are the ſame."</p>
               <p>"I cannot conceal the truth; they certainly are."</p>
               <p>"Are you aware of the conſequences of entering upon a plan of life, where your duties and intereſts will excite a perpetual rebellion of intellect, and in which it is impoſſible to unite the cultivation of thoſe mental powers you poſſeſs, with a reſpectable progreſs in buſineſs?"</p>
               <p>"I have thought on this;—again and again have thought on it—but what can I do? The will of my benefactor, of my mother, o'erpoiſes all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.

I know now that this was ambition in embryo; and had my parents' ſituation in life placed an army within my early views, I doubt not I ſhould have felt the ſame impulſe to have ſeized the truncheon from a General, as I did to diſplace the clergyman from his pulpit, or thruſt the performer from the ſtage.</p>
               <p>"At ſeven years old I poſſeſſed all the gravity of a ſage. The paſtimes of other boys were my aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Books of all deſcriptions that came within my reach I read, but not with that delight that anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me in ſcribbling over every piece of paper I could procure, with what I called my ſtudies. The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions were generally of a ſimilar nature with the book I had laſt read; and of courſe I was a theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian, a dramatiſt, a poet, and a noveliſt, in turn. Nothing, however, at this period was a greater treat to me, than to be permitted to remain at table after dinner, when the other children were ſent to play, that I might liſten to the diſcourſe of my elders.</p>
               <p>"My bodily frame was ſuch as may be expected from an indulgent mode of bringing up in a city, and my own ſedentary inclination—weak and delicate. This conſideration induced my father, for ſome time,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:038596_0032_10129E61766AADE8"/>
to object to placing me in a public ſeminary, where a relation offered to provide for me. Poverty, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, advancing rapidly towards his humble dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and quickening its pace, after domeſtic oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy had quitted it with my mother, made him ſoon accept the offer of his couſin.</p>
               <p>"I left my native roof ere I was eight years old, and became a member of the celebrated public ſchool at Eton. This I eſteem the firſt grand aera in my life. A public ſeminary is a little republic, where the honours and advantages of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity lie open to all; and in no other ſoil can the ſeeds of ambition be ſo well cultivated. Soon was the ſpark of emulation felt within my boſom, infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing energy and vigour into every action. The middling claſſes beheld me, with envy, paſs their ranks; and the higheſt wondered at my<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſwift ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach. Succeſs urged freſh endeavours, and ere I had attained my thirteenth year, I was qualified for the univerſity; where I already was, in fancy, ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling for academical diſtinctions.</p>
               <p>"Juſt before my fourteenth birth day, was the ſecond grand aera in my life. My father died in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent. A letter from his couſin, my benefactor, acquainted me, that, in conſequence of ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable failures in his ſpeculations, his fortune was much leſſened; and that he could not fulfil his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of ſupporting me at the univerſity; adding, that as I was now of an age to go into the world, he wiſhed me to think of ſome trade I ſhould like.</p>
               <p>"You, Mr. Barnwell, can conceive my feelings; I cannot deſcribe them. In the firſt moments of my diſappointment, rage conquered reaſon, and I conſidered my benefactor worſe than an aſſaſſin. 'My God!' exclaimed I, 'is he not a murderer? Has he not made me the parent of the fondeſt hopes, the brighteſt, deareſt expectations? Did he not, him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf beget theſe dreams of bliſs which I have che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed? and now, with a word, he murders every hope!'—<hi>Trade!</hi>—my ſoul ſickened at the ſound.
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:038596_0033_10129E648F76C550"/>
                  <hi>Apprentice!</hi>—horror was in the word, and every hope of happineſs vaniſhed from my ſight. In another moment different feelings agitated me. My warm, romantic fancy, could not at once relinquiſh the views it had foſtered. Pride aided fancy; and I perſuaded myſelf, that were my genius but known, it would moſt certainly be patronized. I reſolved to write to a celebrated nobleman, at that time a patron of literature. The ſame evening on which I received my couſin's letter, I wrote one for this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, intending to ſend it the following morning; but in the morning my mind was in a different frame.</p>
               <p>"I reſolved to ſee my benefactor. He was an opulent tradeſman, and reſided in the metropolis. 'You have received my letter, Henry,' ſaid he. 'I am ſorry you ſhould be diſappointed in your views, though I have not a doubt but you will do much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in trade, than by drudging all your life time over books. Have you any choice?'</p>
               <p>"None that I can follow now, Sir. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged a hope that my induſtry at college might poſſibly have recommended me—'To be ſome great man's toad-eater,' interrupted he: 'Is that what you mean?—It could do nothing elſe for you. The church is abſolutely beſet with hungry ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. There's no arriving at the bar without a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; and as to phyſic, a man's talents will never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend him to a patient, if he keeps no carriage. I wiſh to be your friend, Henry; and I think I know how:—it muſt be by placing you in ſuch a ſituation, as, however diſagreeable it may appear on entering, will lead you to independence.'</p>
               <p>"I began now ſeriouſly to reflect upon the truth of theſe obſervations. I recollected I was ſpeaking to the only friend I had on earth; and though my pride ſuffered a ſevere wound, my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was improved in my own eſtimation.</p>
               <p>"After a pauſe, I yielded my aſſent to the truth of his obſervations, and expreſſed a wiſh that I could write a fine hand, as it might poſſibly be in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"He ſmiled at my wiſh—'You are in the ſame error there,' ſaid he. 'I believe no ſet of men la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour more, in general, than perſons of that deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—and what is their reward?—a clean ſhirt, and a ſhining pair of ſhoes; which is pleaſant enough for a young man in his teens. But think of the ſituation of ſuch men, if they marry—if they live to old age! A mechanic, who earns fifteen ſhillings a week, is a prince to them. I by no means controul you: if you think genteel miſery deſirable, you will be a merchant's clerk.</p>
               <p>"I was humbled in my own ſight; my heart no longer throbbed in the expectations that had delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it; I felt it ſinking, and a paſſive acquieſcence in his ſentiments was the conſequence.</p>
               <p>"We parted, with a promiſe from him to ſend me the addreſs of a grocer the next day, on whom I was to wait as my future maſter.</p>
               <p>"My colleagues at ſchool ſaw an alteration in my countenance, and ſoon diſcovered my future deſtiny; which attracted the ſcorn of ſome, the pity of many.</p>
               <p>"Inſtead of ſleeping that night, my mind was buſily employed in contraſting the real with the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cied ſituation that was to ſucceed my ſchool days. My thirſt for literature was never more to be indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, but conquered. Ah! fatal deluſion! I thought it might be conquered—But, hear me, Mr. Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well—and would to God all men might hear me—the thirſt of knowledge is occaſioned, Sir, by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenchable ſpark, and muſt be gratified, or will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume. Imagine not I mean to ſanction idleneſs, which oft aſſumes the mark of genius, but is not, cannot be allied to it. Imagine not that I would ſanction reſtleſsneſs of mind, which ſcowls, diſſatisfied, at its own lot, and covets every other. Imagine not that I approve that morbid ſenſibility, ſo oft miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took by its poſſeſſors for heaven-born genius—by no means! But if the ſoul perceives with itſelf that

               <p>"Let ſuch a man reſiſt the natural impulſe he will feel to yield his inclinations to the well meant, but fatal, advice even of parents.

               <p>"I waited on Mr. Nutting, the grocer. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived me in a little room at the back of his ſhop, where Mrs. Nutting was ſitting. They appeared plain, plodding ſort of folks, remarkably neat in their dreſs, and preciſe in their diſcourſe. After a variety of queſtions, Mr. Nutting inquired if I was ſenſible of the importance of an intereſt in the merits and ſufferings of our Bleſſed Saviour. I cannot deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the aſtoniſhment this queſtion occaſioned me. Mr. Nutting ſaw my ſurpriſe—</p>
               <p>'Well, well,' ſaid he, 'I ſee you have not been brought up with a proper ſenſe of your eternal wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.

               <p>"Every neceſſary was provided for me at Mr. Darwall's expence, and I bade farewell, with a ſigh, to my ſchool and my ſchool companions.</p>

"When the buſineſs of the day was ended, my apartment was the kitchen, my companions a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſt old woman, who was the ſervant, and her friend a black cat. Here I might have regaled myſelf after the fatigue of the day with reading; but unfortunately, the old lady's library, conſiſting of the Pilgrim's Progreſs, the Holy War, and a vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume or two of ſermons, was at that time little ſuited to my taſte. The pious diſcourſe of the old dame was ſtill leſs pleaſing; thus (too fatigued for bodily employment) ſleep, or a meditation, were my only alternatives; and from theſe I was frequently rouſed by the tabernacle hymns, to the tune of which the old woman mended her ſtockings.</p>
               <p>"On Sundays I conſtantly attended the meeting to which my maſter belonged, where I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to hear doctrines, at which my blood chilled, and my heart grew faint.</p>
               <p>"The gloom of Calviniſm, the diſappointment of my firſt hopes, the conqueſt of my pride, the dull and cheerleſs life I lead, in a ſhort ſpace of time ſo cooled the former ardor of my mind, that, if it is too much to ſay, I was heart-broken; I was reduced to that ſtate of mind, which ſees no brightening proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects in futurity, and which, ceaſing to hope, ſtudies and ſtruggles to endure.</p>
               <p>"Such was the ſtate of mind in which, with a trembling hand, I ſigned the indentures that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned me for ſeven years to the gloom of a cloiſter, without its conſolations or tranquility.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Nutting, previous to my being bound, had often hinted to me, that I was ſlow in buſineſs; and thinking of one thing, whilſt I was doing another; and having once caught me in the attitude of ſtudy, leaning upon a broom, with which I was ſweeping the ſhop, he exclaimed—"Henry, this won't do; you ſeem more fit for a philoſopher than a tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man."</p>
               <p>"With this opinion, which was certainly a juſt one, Mr. Nutting ought not to have taken me as his
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:038596_0038_10129E730CB73408"/>
apprentice. But Mr. Nutting was not a rich man; and Mr. Darwall had promiſed him a premium of ſixty guineas.</p>
               <p>"From what I have related, you will readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that I made but poor progreſs in the art and myſtery of the Grocer's Company; and though cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and willingly obeying my maſter in all his commands, I yet failed to pleaſe him: the natural conſequence of a want of that energy in my buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, of which inclination muſt be the parent.</p>
               <p>"I was more fortunate with my miſtreſs. She was of a mild temper, and humane diſpoſition, and was a ſtrict Calviniſt from ſincere conviction. Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to her huſband in intellect, ſhe would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, when opportunity offered, enter on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with me, and diſcovered an amiable heart. She was miſtreſs of all the controverſies upon theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical topics<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and felt great delight in confuting the arguments of the opponents of Calvin.</p>
               <p>"When you recollect, Sir, that Mrs. Nutting's was the only converſation I enjoyed, which embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in any degree mental topics, you will not be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, that, notwithſtanding it was religious. I eſteemed it highly. In ſhort, I became delighted with theſe occaſional recreations from the jargon of congou, bohea, ſouchong, and hyſon.</p>
               <p>"Sill more delighted was I to liſten to her, while ſhe qualified the doctrines of Calviniſm, and labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reconcile the benevolence of the Creator with the doom of the created, and the unborn. Her language was warm:—her colourings exhibited the ſtrongeſt lights, and deepeſt ſhades. She ſtaggered my reaſon, opened new ſcenes to my view, and ſo far conquered my objections, as to make me wiſh and pray that I could believe her creed.</p>
               <p>"She perceived the criſis, and gave me permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to take what books I pleaſed from her book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe, which contained the whole body of Calviniſtic divinity. Thus two or three years paſſed away, at the expiration of which I had become a zealous Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt.</p>

               <p>"This ſtranger was a man, who, having obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed early in life the poſſeſſion of a conſiderable eſtate, had given the reins to his paſſions, and had indulged in every pleaſure that a vitiated taſte and corrupt principles ſuggeſted.

               <p>"Chance led him to the houſe he was in, and the landlord of that houſe was a ſtrict diſſenter, of the ſame perſuaſion as Mr. Nutting, whoſe ſanctity and upright conduct had been frequently proclaimed in the hearing of the dying man.

"Such, at length, was the confidence he repoſed in Mr. Nutting, that he made a will, by which he bequeathed an eſtate in Hertfordſhire, and ſome conſiderable property in the funds, to his daughter, upon the expreſs condition of her reſiding with Mr. Nutting till her twenty-fifth year, or till her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with his conſent.</p>
               <p>"So ſtrictly was his will drawn up, that Mr. Nutting, who was his ſole executor, obtained by it an unlimited controul over his ward during her minority, and an arbitrary diſpoſal of her in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, beſides the intereſt of her property while ſhe reſided in his houſe.</p>
               <p>"The Captain died. Miſs Elliſon had viſited him two or three times at his lodgings, and was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of his intentions reſpecting her.

               <p>'It is a ſyſtem of geography in French, Sir,' re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Elinor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:038596_0042_10129E80213DD3A0"/>
'French!—ah, well; it may be Dutch, or Greek, or Algebra, or any thing elſe, for what I know; but I muſt take this here book, and all them there, that I don't underſtand myſelf—Pack of nonſenſe, I dare ſay—but they'll cut up for the ſhop.'</p>
               <p>'Oh, dear Sir,' ſaid Elinor, 'you would not, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroy my library! If you do not approve of my reading French, I pledge my word I will not. But, pray, do not deſtroy the books: ſeveral of them are valuable.'</p>
               <p>'Pledge your word—Yes—yes—pretty pledge enough. No, no—the ſafeſt way is to put it out of your power. I ſtand in a moſt awful ſituation, child. I ſhall have to anſwer for the great charge of your ſoul, that has been ſo providentially com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my care; and nothing ſhall you read that I do not underſtand.'</p>
               <p>"Elinor looked aſhoniſhed, but Mr. Nutting did not notice her. Having laid his hand upon another book—</p>
               <p>'Mercy on us!—here's a play book!' exclaimed he. 'Did your Mrs. Herris know of this too?'</p>
               <p>'O dear, yes, Sir; there are eight volumes of them: they are the immortal Shakeſpear's.'</p>
               <p>'God forgive you, child! Immortal!—Yes; he is, doubtleſs, in immortal torments. Here, Henry, take the immortal Shakeſpears away.'</p>
               <p>"Poor Elinor trembled—Mrs. Nutting ſaw her diſtreſs.—</p>
               <p>'You ſhould conſider, my dear,' ſaid ſhe, 'Elinor has been brought up by worldly people; and though it is an infinite mercy that brought her to our roof, there muſt be an inward change wrought in her heart before ſhe can be brought to ſee the folly of her worldly wiſdom.'—</p>
               <p>"How I bleſſed my miſtreſs. She ſpoke my thoughts. Mr. Nutting made no reply, put proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the true zeal of an inquiſitor.</p>
               <p>'Milton's Paradiſe Loſt! Aye, put that on the ſhelf if you will,' ſaid he. 'Hervey's Meditations! that you may take. But, here, put all the reſt up

So, child, if you want books to read <hi>ax</hi> Mrs. Nutting, and ſhe'll put what's proper into your hands; though I think the needle ſuits beſt of week days; and on the ſabbath you may read your bible.'</p>
               <p>"Surprize, regret, and ſomething like anger, mingled their influence in the mind of Miſs Elliſon, and a tear ſtood quivering in her eye. I obeyed ſo much of my maſter's orders as to carry the box into the loft, and intended to finiſh my commiſſion when I went to my chamber, which was one ſtory lower than the loft. But, O, ſovereign genius—invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power—inextinguiſhable ſpark!—then, again, thy ſmothered embers blazed!</p>
               <p>"Taking my candle and my hammar, I aſcended the loft, I placed my candle on the floor, and was about to drive the nail, when a ſudden impulſe of curioſity arreſted my arm.—</p>
               <p>"Suppoſe, thought I, I juſt look over theſe books. They are profane, ſaid Calvin; they are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of men deſtitute of the enlightening ſpirits of God, and may tend to draw your affections from holy things.—</p>
               <p>"Only one peep, cried curioſity; perhaps I may meet ſome old acquaintance that I have almoſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; for it was full three years ſince I had look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into any book ſave the theological labours of Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts.</p>
               <p>"Down I dropped upon my knees. 'If it be a ſin, God forgive it; if it is temptation, Lord deliver me.' I opened the box, trembling; I took up a volume and opened it. It was a volume of Shakeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and the paſſage that caught my eye was the ſpeech of Portia on mercy. As I read, my heart grew warm; as I proceeded, it grew warmer; and when I came to the line—'It is an attribute of God himſelf,' it literally glowed within me.</p>

"This ſpeech had been my favourite at ſchool, and I had ſpouted it an hundred times. It brought to my recollection another, for which I eagerly ſearched and found in the ſame author: 'O gentle ſleep, &amp;c.' My ſpirits ſeemed to have gained a deliverance from fetters; my heart beat quicker than for a long time paſt; and I went on devouring the contents of the box with as much appetite as a hungry man would a dinner. I taſted every diſh that preſented itſelf, and found each diſh a dainty. Nearly at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the box was a volume of Sir Charles Grandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, which I opened at the intereſting converſation of Sir Charles and Lady Clementina upon the topic of religion. Conceive the intereſt I felt; and judge my regret when I heard the clock ſtrike three, and ſaw the approaching departure of my light, which glimmered in the ſocket of the candleſtick. I found my way to bed in the dark; but ſleep was far off.</p>
               <p>"The ſpring of reaſon, that had been ſtretched to impotence by bigotry, ſeemed by this accident to have recovered its elaſticity, and once more reſumed its operations—O Superſtition, how great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to thy prejudice!</p>
               <p>"I recollected the ſcene in Miſs Elliſon's cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. I placed before my fancy the ignorant piety of my maſter, and the profane intelligence of his ward. I dared even to trace the origin of their principles. I did more; I inquired, if it was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent idea, to ſuppoſe a beneficent Creator would grant a ſpecial light to a few of his creatures, by which they only ſhould be guided to eternal bliſs; while the multitude are doomed to wander through a dark paſſage to the precipice of everlaſting woe?

               <p>WHEN George arrived at the baronet's, a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil was ſitting to conſider of proper meaſures to be adopted relative to the nightly appearances at the abbey.</p>
               <p>George had been meditating all the way from old Mental's upon the ſame ſubject, and had determined to watch this night among the ruins. Over-ruling every objection that was ſtarted, he abided by his reſolution; and when the reſt of the family retired to their chambers, he muffled himſelf up in a box coat, armed himſelf with a brace of piſtols, and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied forth towards the ruins.</p>
               <p>Darkneſs and ſilence reigned; with difficulty he diſcovered his way, and ere he reached the aiſle, the echoes of the midnight chimes rolled amongſt the ruins. At the ſame moment he obſerved a light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed torch glide ſlowly towards the avenue that led to the aiſle: at the entrance the perſon who carried it turned round—George ſtepped behind a column, and ſaw the ſame maſked figure he had beheld on the preceding evening.</p>
               <p>After gazing earneſtly round him for a few ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conds, the figure moved ſlowly towards the aiſle. With a gentle tread George followed him, but ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped at the entrance of the aiſle, and reclined his head againſt the remains of a ſtone arched gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, in the attitude of liſtening.</p>
               <p>Preſently the tones of a harp ſtruck his ear: they were ſolemn, ſlow, and melancholy. After a few intereſting movements, a voice accompanied the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument. George could no longer reſiſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:038596_0046_10129E8BC15E8E30"/>
of curioſity; but, creeping ſoftly, entered the aiſle. The Unknown ſat with his back to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance upon a little ſtool, near the tomb, upon which lay his maſk. A lamp burnt upon the ground, and the torch was extinguiſhed. The anxiety of his mind prevented George from hearing diſtinctly the words of a ballad, but of which his memory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the following fragment.—</p>

During the time this ballad was ſinging, George ſtood motionleſs, with his eyes fixed on the ſinger. When it was concluded, he withdrew a few paces back, to a ſpot where he might ſee, unobſerved, what ſhould paſs.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as he had finiſhed this ballad, which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to agitate him extremely, the Unknown ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his ſeat, and, claſping his hands together violently, exclaimed—"O! what torments—what tortures could cruelty invent equal to thy ſtings—thy ſcorpion ſtings—O, inward hell of guilt!—O, conſcience! Am I for everlaſting to endure theſe pangs? And will this worm for ever live within me?—O! that a blow could ſtrangle it;—that leaping into burning liquid could annihilate all thought! Why—why—fool that I am—why do I heſitate to try?"</p>
               <p>As he uttered the laſt words he drew a piſtol from his boſom—"This, in a moment, brings me to my—Would I could ſay, my end! But, no—no—no!—She did not ceaſe to be, when this accurſed arm plunged this bloody ſteel into her beauteous breaſt! (holding up a dagger, bloody at the point)—"Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where ſhe ſtill exiſts; for ſtill her ſpirit haunts her ruthleſs murderer!—ſteals from his pillow peace; and makes the light of day more hedious than dark and gloomy night!—meets me in every walk—croſſes me in every path; and here—even here—where like an outcaſt wretch I mourn away my nights—here, too, it follows me, and makes a hell. O, wretch!—wretch!"</p>
               <p>As he ſpoke, he threw his arms upon the tomb, and buried his face in his hands. The ſuſpicions of George were juſt: his voice, his face, declared this confeſſor of murder to be Mental. Horror and aſtoniſhment ſtruck him to the ſoul; he tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and ſhuddered at the diſcovery, while a varying train of ideas floated in his brain.</p>
               <p>In a few minutes his attention was again arreſted. Mental exclaimed—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:038596_0048_10129E9030320B10"/>
"Away this dream of horror! Was ſhe not faithleſs?" And then, in a ſofter tone—"Yes, <hi>faithleſs</hi> as <hi>fair!"</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He flew to his harp, and moving his fingers briſkly, ſeemed endeavouring to recollect ſome air. "Aye—that was a favourite," cried he: "how char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly did ſhe look when her ſnow-white arms were extended to touch theſe ſtrings—her flaxen hair flowing in ringlets about her lovely neck—her expreſſive eyes beaming glances of love upon me—while her coral lips moved to the melody of an angel's voice!—And yet I could deſtroy her!—could change that breathing beauty into putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! I was that monſter; and now, like an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant that has broke his toy, I could ſit down and weep a life a way! O! if repentance were availing—what do I not ſuffer! Fooliſh mankind!—among thy race how many a holy penitent have I viewed whoſe lengthened viſage, and briny eye, has ſoothed away remorſe! Why, then, in what a mould was I formed, that my wounds ſhould reſiſt all healing applications? Is there no balſam that may cure my ſoul?—'Phyſician, Omnipotent Phyſician!—"</p>
               <p>Here he ſunk upon his knees; but in a moment ſtarting up—</p>
               <p>"Mental! ar't turning Monk," exclaimed he, "as if an interceſſion could more avail with the All-powerful than his own benevolence? Call back time paſt—undo paſt deeds—bid the dead live—and then expect the peace that thou haſt parted with for ever!"</p>
               <p>Not a ſyllable that ſell from the lips of this miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable man was loſt by George. Three hours paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away, during which Mental occaſionally broke out into ſimilar ejaculations, or played upon the harp. Soon as a diſtant bell tolled three, he lit his torch; and removing a large and heavy ſtone, which lay at ſome diſtance from the tomb, a kind of grave appeared, in which he depoſited the harp, the lamp,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:038596_0049_10129E9305A51568"/>
and the ſtool, and replaced the ſtone; then maſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf, he left the aiſle, and George, at a cautious diſtance, followed him.</p>

               <p>UNDETERMINED in his mind, whether to reveal or conceal the diſcovery of the preceding night, George joined the family at breakfaſt. To avoid their queſtions, however, he informed them generally, that he had been partly ſucceſsful in his reſearch; and that in another evening he expected to be able to unravel the whole myſtery.</p>
               <p>Fortunately a letter arrived from the knight, which turned the converſation from a ſubject that George would have encountered ſome difficulty in diſguiſing, and which he did not wiſh to reveal till he had heard the ſequel of old Mental's ſtory.</p>

There are favourable reports from India; but, as I intend writing upon buſineſs to-morrow, ſhall make my preſent letter a domeſtic one. Will you never accede to the petitions of Mrs. Emery and myſelf, and truſt your Maria with us for a winter?

               <p>VARIOUS were the emotions which agitated the mind of young Barnwell, as he ſtrolled towards the houſe of Mr. Mental. When he was introduced into his preſence, he trembled.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:038596_0052_10129E9BE3C0E888"/>
"Ere we parted, Sir," ſaid Mental, abruptly, "I think I had introduced Miſs Elliſon to your acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and beſtowed ſome praiſe upon her perſon. It is abſolutely impoſſible to pourtray her mind, at once ſimple and noble, condeſcending and dignified. I will not attempt even to ſketch its outlines, but ſhall confine myſelf to a ſingle narrative of facts, in which her actions will more faithfully unfold her mind, than can the moſt labouring deſcription.</p>
               <p>"However diſſimilar the manners of the Nuttings were to thoſe which a poliſhed ſtate had made her own; however abhorrent their gloomy notions of religion to a mind of exquiſite ſenſibility, and an underſtanding of uncommon ſtrength and cultivation; having once brought herſelf to believe it her duty to obey the injunctions of her father's will, ſhe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without ſullenneſs, to their mode of life, and paid a decent reſpect to thoſe duties which their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion enjoined them to obſerve.</p>
               <p>"But do not imagine ſhe played the hypocrite. She never avowed her diſſent from their doctrines. and ſcrupled not to confeſs her diſlike at their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſe way of living. Honored—ſhall I not ſay bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed—with the confidence of this charming woman, my ſituation ſeemed changed from the moſt cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to the moſt bliſsful. We read, we converſed together; we wrote, and ſubmitted our performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to the criticiſms of each other. In ſhort, we ſeemed mutually to confeſs, that in that houſe, at leaſt, there was no pleaſure but in each other's ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. What the library in the loft had left unfiniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Miſs Elliſon's converſation completed; and my ſoul once again glowed with hope.</p>
               <p>"I looked forward with impatience to the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of my ſervitude, when I imagined, I ſhould burſt forth upon the world as a prodigy of genius. The hours of pleaſure which were heretofore gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſpent in reading the horrors of Calviniſm, were now employed in peruſing various authors, or in the

If ever I ſee you ſpeak to her, or look at her, I'll—'Here, choaked with anger, he ſtamped his foot, and threw down three pots of honey; an accident that by no means helped to reſtore him to reaſon.</p>
               <p>"The conſequence of this diſcovery was an abridgment of the opportunities of converſing with my Elinor, and a more rigid line of conduct towards Miſs Elliſon herſelf.</p>
               <p>"Shortly after this event, another occurred of moſt deciſive conſequences towards us both. A relation of Mrs. Nutting was taken ill, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted her attendance. She went to reſide with her a few weeks at Hampſtead. On the Saturdays Mr. Nutting went to ſleep there, and returned uſually on the Monday morning. Miſs Elliſon was left in the Strand, as a guardian to the houſe. On one of theſe Saturdays Elinor and myſelf had planned to bribe the old woman, I have mentioned as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to ſecrecy, and to embrace the opportunity of going to a play. The old dame, would never have conſented to our viſiting the 'Devil's Houſe,' as ſhe termed the theatre; and therefore it became neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to deceive her with the tale of a viſit we were going to pay Mrs. Herris, the former governeſs of Miſs Elliſon. To this ſhe yielded, after a few <hi>weighty</hi> arguments.</p>
               <p>"I can now ſee a great inconſiſtency in Miſs Elliſon's conduct, as well as a great impropriety in my own, in thus abuſing the confidence placed in us both. But, Sir, at the moment I am ſpeaking of, temptation was irreſiſtible; you cannot conceive its ſtrength.</p>
               <p>"Elinor was as paſſionately fond of theatrical performances as myſelf. I had not ſeen one in the ſpace of four years, nor had ſhe ſince her entrance into our family; nor was there the remoteſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that any other opportunity would occur during our ſtay with the Nuttings.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="unknown:038596_0055_10129EA5E6EA5F30"/>
"The play to be performed that evening was Shakeſpear's Romeo and Juliet; and the Romeo was Garrick.</p>
               <p>"There were ſeveral ſcruples to conquer; but, in the end, temptation triumphed.</p>
               <p>"Taking ſome precautions to diſguiſe our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we went and mingled with the crowd that had aſſembled at the pit door of Drury Lane theatre. Unaccuſtomed to the place, and ſurrounded com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely by a concourſe of people, Elinor began to tremble with terror.</p>
               <p>"The attraction of Garrick had drawn an unuſual throng: the heat and preſſure became almoſt inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable to Miſs Elliſon, and, added to her fright, at length overpowered to endure it. She told me that ſhe felt herſelf fainting. I attempted to make a retreat through the crowd. It was impoſſible. She faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my arms. At the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"When my ſenſes returned, I found myſelf in a ſtrange bed, with ſeveral perſons ſtanding round me. Aſtoniſhment ſeized me for a moment; but when the memory of the ſcene that had paſſed recurred, it was like an arrow ſhot through my brain—'The lady!—the lady!—Elinor!—Miſs Elliſon!—is ſhe alive!—where is ſhe!' exclaimed I in the agony of the moſt torturing ſuſpenſe. In lifting my hands to my head, I found I had been bled.</p>
               <p>"The people around me ſtared in my face, and at one another, but made no reply to my queſtions. 'My God! will you not tell me?' They ſhook their heads in ſign of pity. 'She is dead!—ſhe is mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered then!' exclaimed I. 'Poor youth!' cried a man who ſtood neareſt to me; 'poor youth!—his brain is quite diſordered. I believe we muſt take a little more blood.' 'You'd better look, whoſe to pay you, firſt,' cried a fat man in a red worſted cap; 'I think inſtead of bleeding, we'd better ſee and get

a chair, and take him to the workhouſe. He can't ſtay here all night. I don't know what buſineſs ſome folks have to bring all <hi>caſulties</hi> to my houſe.' 'Why, as to that, Mr. Brown,' cried a decent-looking man, 'where could we take him ſo proper:—who would have thought, to look at him, but that he was dead; and in that caſe, the coroner would have ſat upon the body at your houſe, and you'd have had no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.</p>
               <p>"Where am I, then? exclaimed I—'Where are you!' cried the fat man:—'why, you're at the Dolphin, in Drury Lane: and as you ſeem in your ſenſes now, young man, pray, where do you live—who are your friends?'</p>
               <p>"My God! what a thunderbolt was this queſtion. Inſtead of anſwering this man, I repeated my queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning Elinor, but could procure no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. My anxiety made me ſtrong. I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ariſe; nor could the whole College of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians have prevailed upon me to relinquiſh my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I dreſſed myſelf with aſſiſtance. I was ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bruiſed in ſeveral places, but had received no mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial injury.</p>
               <p>It was nine o'clock when I left the Dolphin. My inquiries after Elinor were for along time fruitleſs. All the intelligence that I could gather in the neighbourhood of the theatre was, that a young lady had been tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to death, and conveyed away in a hackney coach, but whither, nobody knew.</p>
               <p>"I went home, with a faint hope that ſhe might have been conveyed thither. I rung the bell; the old woman appeared, and her firſt inquiry was—'What have you done with Miſs?'</p>
               <p>"Without anſwering her queſtion, I ran away I returned back to the door—Again I left it, and, from the anxiety of mind, played the antics of a madman.</p>

ideas—I ſaw her dead!—worſe than dead!—I ſaw her perſon violated!—I heard her ſhrieks!—I ſaw her agonies!—and my reaſon abſolutely reeled. Morning appeared; I had walked the whole night; I had taken no refreſhment; and I found myſelf ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with fatigue.</p>
               <p>"As I paſſed the Chapter Coffee-Houſe in St. Paul's church yard, the ſervants were taking down the ſhutters. I went in; and, leaning my head upon a table, indulged a ſile<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

After them was a ſhort, neat looking man, who ſeated himſelf near me—'How is your patient this morning, Mr. Brookes?' ſaid a gentleman to him. 'She ſtill remains inſenſible,' replied he; 'but her fever is lower.' 'Poor thing!' ſaid the other, 'and was there nothing about her that could give you any idea who ſhe is? There are ſome aching hearts on her account by this time.'</p>
               <p>"Merciful Providence!—have I then found her? exclaimed I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in a tone that alarmed the whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany.</p>
               <p>"If you have any heart!—if you would relieve the moſt wretched being on earth!—continued I; pray take me to my Elinor.</p>
               <p>"The people gathered round me with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. An ecclairciſſement took place. It was my Elinor. The humanity of Mr. Brookes, who was a reſpectable bookſeller, had ſaved her life; and ſhe was then at his houſe in Paternoſter Row.</p>
               <p>"I ſaw her, but ſhe knew me not; though, in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"Relieved from the heavieſt part of my anxiety, I had now leiſure to think of my own ſituation; but could not reſolve how to act. Mr. Nutting I dared not to ſee; Mr. Darwall I ſhuddered to meet.</p>
               <p>"I made Mr. Brookes my confidante, who humane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offered me an aſylum in his own houſe, till he
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:038596_0058_10129EAD48072530"/>
could reconcile me to Mr. Nutting, or at leaſt to Mr. Darwall, whom he determined to ſee the following morning.</p>
               <p>"His endeavours were unavailing with both. The former firmly proteſted againſt ever receiving me again into his houſe; and ſo repreſented me to the latter, that his heart was completely ſteeled againſt me. Thus did one trivial event deprive me of the only friend I had on earth. Thus were nearly five years of my life fooled away, without affording the leaſt advantage to myſelf, or ſatisfaction to my ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efactor.</p>
               <p>"I had now, indeed, my liberty; but indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence came too late, and in too melancholy a way.</p>
               <p>"I perceive, Mr. Barnwell, I muſt be leſs prolix. One incident leads on inſenſibly to another. I muſt content myſelf, therefore, with a more general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>"Paſſing over, then, many tender and affecting interviews I had with Miſs Elliſon, on her recovery, at the houſe of Mr. Brookes, ere ſhe was well enough to be removed to her guardian's, I will confine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the one in which a mutual confeſſion of love, (for we really loved) took place.</p>
               <p>"She had that morning received a letter from Mr. Nutting, urging her return.</p>
               <p>"And when do you mean to go, Miſs Elliſon? ſaid I.</p>
               <p>'Never! replied ſhe with firmneſs. 'I will not ſacrifice independence and happineſs to wealth!'</p>
               <p>"Miſs Elliſon, are you ſerious?</p>
               <p>'I am reſolved. I went there in obedience to my father's will. I found the ſituation barely tolerable.</p>
               <p>After this unfortunate accident it will no longer be ſo. I ſhall, therefore, relinquiſh all claim to my fortune, and retain the rights of a human being!'</p>
               <p>"My God, Elinor!—Madam, what are you pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing—what means of living, what proſpects even of a ſubſiſtence have you in view?—</p>

               <p>'I—I—Madam—I—I am a man—</p>
               <p>'And is the privilege of procuring a ſubſiſtence confined to men excluſively?

               <p>Why did he not propoſe it yeſterday?</p>
               <p>'What happened yeſterday, then, Sir? Is it too late? Tell me, what of yeſterday?'</p>
               <p>"O, Madam!—O, Elinor!—yeſterday was a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal day. Depreſſed with gloomy ideas, I wandered through the buſy ſtreets of this metropolis, rumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the paſt, and on the future. I looked back, without much regret, at what I have left, but with ſorrow at what I have done. I had ſacrificed the moſt important part of life to an implicit ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to another's judgment. I had loſt that <hi>"tide in the affairs of men, which leads to fortune,"</hi> and nothing but miſeries and ſhallows preſented themſelves in the

                  <hi>reſt of my voyage.'</hi> In all the boundleſs ocean of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity I could behold no ſingle ſpot on which to caſt Hope's anchor.</p>
               <p>"As I walked on, muſing in this ſtrain, the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of a celebrated Pleader paſſed me, in which he lolled at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Would I were that happy youth, ſighed I. What admirable exerciſe for the mind does ſuch a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion open!—what opportunities for diſplaying its powers! And it is mere prejudice to imagine a man cannot poſſeſs a liberal mind, who is a lawyer.</p>
               <p>"The carriage ſtopped—Inſtinctively I followed them into the Guild Hall. The courts were ſitting. A cauſe was arguing—I liſtened—I became intereſted in the arguments—I wondered at the omiſſion of many, which would have made for or againſt the queſtion. The judge roſe to give his opinion. I had anticipated much that he ſaid. My proud heart fluttered; I was a pleader in imagination, I applauded myſelf—was happy in my fancies. The verdict was given; the crowd diſperſed; and then—I felt <hi>what I really was!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"As the concourſe of people ſeparated at the door, one cried, ſhaking another's hand—'I muſt go—ſo and ſo—ſuch buſineſs calls me.' Another replied—'I ſhould have been at ſuch a place.' Every one appeared to be running after ſome object that occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied his mind, and brought emolument to himſelf. 'And where ſhall I go!' ſighed I.</p>
               <p>"In King Street I met a mob, dragging a poor ragged wretch to juſtice, who had been detected in picking a pocket. I mingled with the crowd to hear the examination—'What means have you of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a livelihood?' ſaid the magiſtrate. The cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prit was ſilent—'Why then, to ſave you from the gallows, I ſhall ſend you for a ſoldier.'</p>

                  <hi>"What means have you of getting a livelihood!</hi> rung in my ears. I traverſed ſtreet after ſtreet. Often would I check myſelf with the queſtion—What means have I of getting a livelihood? Where am I going? Not to my father, mother, ſiſter, or brother—theſe are unmeaning ſounds to <hi>me!</hi> Not to my <hi>home</hi>—even that cheering ſound, which delights the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, was but a mockery to me—Then darted acroſs my mind—yes, let me own it—your image, Elinor. I ſaw, at that moment, the utter impoſſibility of your ever being mine—nay, bear with me a moment!—I ſaw you given to ſome rich idiot, whoſe bigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try might pleaſe old Nutting; and I almoſt curſed exiſtence!</p>
               <p>"Juſt then the martial ſound of fife and drum ſtruck my ears. A recruiting party appeared—I pauſed!—<hi>What means</hi> have you of getting a livelihood! ſtill rung in ears. Phrenzy ſeized me—I ran to the lieutenant, and offered him my hand—'I'll ſerve the King!' cried I. The men pulled off their hats, and gave three cheers. The lieutenant ſhook me by the hand; and, after looking in my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>'Merciful heaven! and I have been the cauſe of this,' cried Elinor. 'O, then, it is time, my Henry—my love—it is time to throw off every little affectation of our ſex, and let you ſee my heart—a heart, my Henry, that, whether you accept or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it, is only your's. I love you Henry; and, go where you will, no earthly power, that leaves me life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhall ſeparate me from you.'</p>
               <p>Excuſe theſe few drops of weakneſs!' ſaid Mental, as he wiped his eyes—"They are ſacred to the memory of a martyr!—Yes, Sir, ſhe made this frank avowal of her love, whilſt her beauteous face concealed its virgin bluſhes in my boſom—O! memory—memory!—too faithful memory!"—</p>
               <p>And again the tears would flow.</p>
               <p>"A declaration ſo frank, ſo noble, ſo worthy of

her uncommon character, was met, on my part, by one at leaſt as ſincere, as ardent, as diſintereſted, as her own.</p>
               <p>"The lieutenant being my friend, by his intereſt I obtained a diſcharge from my raſh engagement; and Elinor and myſelf were ſhortly after married.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Brookes continued the friendly rock on which we built our little bower of bliſs. His coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel directed, his benevolence aided, his generoſity munificently remunerated our labours. He was engaged in a very extenſive concern, and found us abundant employ. Elinor wrote a Novel, which ſucceeded well. We publiſhed jointly a volume of Poetry; and we mutually laboured at tranſlations.' Competence was the ſweet reward of our labours, ſupplying us with all the neceſſaries, and many of the decent luxuries of life. We reſided in a ſmall but neat cottage at Walworth; only viſiting the metropolis occaſionally.</p>
               <p>"The life I now lead was the very reality of that picture which imagination had taught my youthful heart to doat upon; and yet, poſſeſſing this reality, I was not content. When literary compoſitions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the means of my ſubſiſtence, I found it irkſome; I fancied it a mean employ of talent to let out for hire. I grew diſſatisfied, I formed a variety of new ſchemes, which alternately delighted and diſguſted me.</p>
               <p>"A period however approached, which compelled me to ſubmit to the irkſomeneſs, and even meanneſs (as I deemed it,) of my employment. My Elinor bore me a daughter. I wept tears of joy; my heart beat with rapture; for at that moment, Sir, I did not dream how many curſes, in diſguiſe, I hailed as bleſſings—I ſometimes laugh to think how my ſilly heart was cheated."</p>
               <p>[Here Mental laughed, but in a manner that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the miſery and horror of his recollections!]</p>
               <p>He continued—</p>

of time unmarked by any record of the memory; but about the time my little girl was three years old, and began to prattle, there happened an event which is ſo firmly printed on my mind's regiſter, that not even the flaming fingers of the fiends of hell can burn the page, nor all the pitying dews that drop from angels' eyes blot out the bloody character!</p>
               <p>"But ſpare me now a taſk I feel beyond my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers—Retire—retire, my young friend—See me to-morrow; and come prepared to hear a tale of horror—!"</p>
               <p>The anguiſh of his heart was viſible in the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling features of his face, and he breathed painfully convulſive ſighs. George preſſed his hand and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired in ſilence.</p>

               <p>"THIS tale of horrors, to which he alluded," ſaid George, muſing on his way home, "muſt be the murder of the Louiſa of his ballad, and the Elinor of his tale. Why does he change the name then?"</p>
               <p>A chain of conjectures on poor Mental's tale oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied his mind till he reached home, when a freſh occurrence demanded his attention.</p>
               <p>Upon entering the drawing-room, he ſtarted back with ſurpriſe, at the ſight of the harp, the lamp, and the ſtool, which he had the preceding night ſeen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited by Mental, under the ſtone in the haunted aiſle. There was nobody in the room—he had found the hall door open, and had entered without ſeeing any of the ſervants. Deſcending the ſtair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſe he met old Joſeph.—</p>
               <p>"O, Sir!" ſaid Joſeph, "ſuch diſcoveries!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:038596_0064_10129EBA442B2B50"/>
"Such diſcoveries!" cried George—"Where?"</p>
               <p>"At the haunted aiſle, Sir. Have you not ſeen the muſic, and the lamp?"</p>
               <p>"Yes:—but how were they diſcovered?"</p>
               <p>"I diſcovered them—" with an air of impatience. "This morning, Sir, I was going to the doctor's for ſome conſerve of roſes, for Mrs. Meredith, the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, who has got a terrible blight in her eyes, as I take it, by ſitting in the garden when the night air—"</p>
               <p>"Well—well, Joſeph—you were going to the doctor's—never mind what about."</p>
               <p>"True, Sir, as you ſay, that's no matter; that's neither here nor there as to the diſcovery. Well, Sir, the neareſt way to Doctor Saffron lies through the park, and the ruins; and though I have many times gone round by the road way for fear, I was determined this morning to go boldly on through the haunted aiſle: and ſo I did; for, ſince our ſearch there, I began to think leſs of the matter than I uſed to do. I did tremble a little, to be ſure, when I got there; but ſome how or other, as if Providence had ordered it ſo, I grew bold when I had been there a while; and finding myſelf a little fatigued with my walk, I ſits me down boldly upon the very tomb where they ſay the naked lady ſits every night. Now only mind, Sir, what great diſcoveries ſometimes happen from trifling things. I had a hat on that was bran new laſt Sunday; the day was hot, ſo I pulls off my hat, and lies it down upon the tomb.—Well when I had reſted me, I takes my hat up, and, behold, all the top of the crown was ſoaked in lamp oil. I was ſtruck very ſtrange, to think how this could happen:—when, lo, and behold ye, I find a quantity of oil, as if it had been ſpilt upon the tomb ſtone; and I find it had dripped, dripped, dripped, all the way along the <hi>moniment</hi> to a large ſtone covered over with moſs, and beyond that ſtone not a drop of oil was there to be ſeen or ſmelt. Then all of a ſudden, it came into my head about the light that has been ſo often ſeen of a night. And—"</p>

                  <pb n="66" facs="unknown:038596_0065_10129EBBD5960FE0"/>
"Enough—enough—" cried George with his uſual impetuoſity of temper—"I know the reſt, good Joſeph, and will ſpare you the trouble of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing it—You moved the ſtone—and there the harp and the lamp was ſound—But here comes Sir James."</p>
               <p>"The ſtrangeſt diſcoveries!" ſaid the baronet.</p>
               <p>"Joſeph has been relating it, Sir," replied George.</p>
               <p>"Well," continued the knight—"and what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures do you draw from it?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Sandall, Mrs. and Miſs Barnwell joined them.</p>
               <p>"The muſic that has been heard, and the rights that have been ſeen, are rationally accounted for, at leaſt, by this diſcovery," ſaid Gearge; but the performer of theſe nocturnal orgies we have yet to diſcover. I ſhould think, Mr. Sandall, a ghoſt would not be at the trouble of hiding thoſe things?"</p>
               <p>Mr. Sandall was ſilent.</p>
               <p>"It ſeems a ſtrange propenſity," ſaid Sir James, "in any man to amuſe himſelf in ſuch midnight re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations. I know nobody I could ſuſpect of ſuch exploits; unleſs, indeed, the ſtrange old fellow, who is the proprietor of the ruins."</p>
               <p>"And who elſe would you ſuſpect, Sir James," ſaid Sandall, "Is not the man known to be every thing that's bad? Who knows for what infernal purpoſes he might hold his nightly ſittings there? Theſe are ſtrange times, Sir James. I was reading to you the Hiſtory of the Illuminati, a book which proves the exiſtence of conſpirators againſt all the world; and I believe that this country is not free from them. The place is retired; Mental's houſe is large; and no one is ſeen to enter his door by day light. Now, who knows but he may entertain in that houſe, or have concealed about the ruins a gang of theſe horrible villains, who would go any lengths to overturn all religion and order. I ſhould not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to dictate to you, Sir James; but you are a
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:038596_0066_10129EBD68F8A9A8"/>
Magiſtrate, Sir James; and a hint to a man of your penetration is ſufficient.—"</p>
               <p>George would certainly have incurred the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the knight by a hearty laugh at his chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, had he not been prevented by a noiſe in the hall below, and alarmed at the voice of Mental him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>The rumour of the diſcovery had ſpread widely in a ſhort time, and had gathered numberleſs addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in its progreſs: till at length the ſtory of a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, committed by Mental, had actually gathered an aſſembly of peaſantry about his gate, who were point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his houſe, and ſignificantly lifting up their hands and eyes to heaven. The old man had noticed them; and by piecemeal had obtained information of the diſcovery.</p>
               <p>Rudely ruſhing into the drawing room, to the extreme terror of Mr. Sandall and the ladies; his head covered, his hands clenched, his eyes darted anger and revenge—"By what authority, what law—by the ſhew of what prerogative, is my proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty removed from my own ſtate, and placed here? exclaimed he—"Yet do not anſwer me! I know the tale that hangs upon your lips. But I demand to know the author of thoſe vile calumnies, which the deluded peaſantry are blowing round my dwelling. I think, I trace the infamous ſuggeſtion in the cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard countenance of yonder prieſt," pointing to Mr. Sandall.</p>
               <p>"Me!—me!" exclaimed Sandall, ſkulking be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind Sir James' chair. "Mr. Mental, I aſſure you, Sir, I have had no hand whatever in the buſineſs."</p>
               <p>"What! can you lie?" ſaid Mental—"O, how ill does it become the man whoſe lips ſpout forth the pureſt and ſublimeſt doctrines ever taught man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to retail calumnies: How ill does it become a man, of any faith, to wound the reputation of his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fellow; then ſhrink at his approach, conſcious of the injury beſtowed, and yet moſt daſtardly diſown the blow!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:038596_0067_10129EC2E62507A8"/>
Mr. Sandall was of a pale complexion; but at this moment his lips were paler than his cheeks, and he could not ſtand upright.</p>
               <p>"Does your reverence know this man?" aſked Mental. [It was farmer Cornall.] Sandall trembled. "The tale you have inſtilled in this man's ear, was wanton, or malicious. Be it as it may, Sir, it ſhall be refuted. You have ſpread ſtories of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment, necromancy, nay, of murder! to my prejudice; that I conceal banditti of Illuminati in my houſe. Now, Sir James,"—to the knight—"you are a magiſtrate—I ſurrender myſelf on the charge of this zealous Protector of the chriſtian faith, and am your priſoner till acquitted. Go to my ſervant, take the keys, ſearch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> every room—nay I inſiſt on it—ſearch every drawer, examine every paper. I fear no diſcoveries."</p>
               <p>After many objections, Sir James conſented to viſit the reſidence of Mr. Mental, as the only means of averting the threats of the labourers, aſſembled from the neighbouring villages, to pull down the houſe.</p>
               <p>Accompanied by Mr. Sandall, and George, he walked towards the houſe; and at the particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Sir James, Mental went with them, ſmiling as he paſſed the inſulting throng aſſembled round them, which all the eloquence and authority of the knight could ſcarcely keep in order.</p>
               <p>As they were entering the houſe, Mental took an opportunity of whiſpering to George, unnoticed—"You have not tattled, boy?"</p>
               <p>"I am no babbler," ſaid George.</p>
               <p>"Then whatever you may now obſerve, be ſecret ſtill. However ſtrange or myſterious may appear my future conduct, at preſent diſcloſe nothing that you know concerning me." Then ſqueezing his hand—"Let this memorandum ſometimes claim a place for me in your thoughts!"—and he ſighed heavily, as he ſlipped a miniature into his hands—George put it in his boſom.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:038596_0068_10129EC5B6B49F98"/>
By this time they had reached the ſitting and ſleeping room—"Here, Sir James," ſaid Mental, "I eat and ſleep; 'tis my whim; there's no ſtatute to the contrary, I believe, Mr. Chaplain! That clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet will open, by turning the handle of the lock. It contains my wardrobe, a few changes of linen, and a roquelaire. The bayonet and belt, that hang up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that peg, I <hi>once wore,</hi> nay, I <hi>once uſed!</hi> I drew hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man blood with that weapon—<hi>Chriſtian</hi> blood, Mr. Sandall;—Engliſh blood, Sir James. 'Twas an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy cauſe: but I was then a ſoldier in the ranks, and endeavoured to annihilate the powers of mind that I poſſeſſed, for they were uſeleſs; and my arm ſent death where the diſcretion of my officers direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. It makes me cold to think on it. I ſee the belt is mouldy, and the bayonet ruſty. I wiſh they were buried in the plains of Quebec. There is nothing elſe worth notice in this room."</p>
               <p>They entered the apartment of poor old Sarah, who was in tears.</p>
               <p>"Why—why—Sarah—Come, come, dry theſe tears—I can bear any calamity better than to ſee a faithful creature, like you, miſerable through my means," ſaid Mental.</p>
               <p>"It han't for myſelf, its for you I cry. I always thought it would come out.</p>
               <p>"Come out!" ſaid Sandall. "What do you mean, good woman?"</p>
               <p>"O, the ſtudy—the ſtudy!"</p>
               <p>"Poor wretch!" cried Mental.</p>
               <p>"What about the ſtudy, good woman?" ſaid Sandall: and then taking Sir James' arm—"Come, lead us to the ſtudy."</p>
               <p>"<hi>I</hi> lead you to the ſtudy!—God forbid! no, no—let <hi>them</hi> that <hi>will,</hi> go for me," cried Sarah.</p>
               <p>George recollected her former dread of the ſtudy.</p>
               <p>"This faithful creature has reſided with me twenty years," ſaid Mental. "In all that time ſhe has not ſeen the inſide of my ſtudy. I ſpend many hours there alone; and often the whole night if it
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:038596_0069_10129EC74D233478"/>
rains, and I am prevented from walking in the abbey, which I prefer in fine weather. The circumſtance has created a myſterious fear in poor Sarah's brain, and ſhe would not enter the ſtudy, I believe, to ſave her life. But you ſhall yourſelves judge how little cauſe of terror exiſts there."</p>
               <p>As they were leaving the room, Sarah took an opportunity, unperceived by Mental, to pull Sandall by the coat, and make earneſt ſigns to him not to go. George himſelf was ſtaggered for a moment by this circumſtance—But Sandall ſeemed petrified with terror.</p>
               <p>"Come, Sir James," ſaid Mental, "I'll ſhew you this ſtudy."</p>
               <p>"They moved on. At the door of the kitchen Sandall turned round, and perceived that Sarah had dropped upon her knees, and was in the attitude of praying. His knees tottered as he aſcended two ſlights of ſtairs, which led to a gallery, at the end of which was a door, which Mental informed them was the ſtudy. He opened the door, and the firſt object that ſtruck their ſight was, the lid of a coffin covered with black cloth: there was a plate fixed on it, with this inſcription—</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Mrs. Elinor Mental, Died July 12th, 1772; Aged 22.</q>
               </p>
               <p>George caſt his eyes curiouſly about the ſtudy, and appeared entering in his memory an inventory of its contents.</p>
               <p>The coffin lid was placed upright in one corner of the room; on a corner ſhelf over it was a human ſkull, in excellent preſervation; near it was a writing ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, on which burnt a lamp, the ſhutters of the windows being continually cloſed; the floor was ſtrewed with books, pamphlets, and newſpapers. A cheſt under the deſk contained a large quantity of ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

concealed by broken crucibles and charcoal duſt. The general appearance of the place conveyed the moſt gloomy ideas, and its furniture conſtituted mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy memorandums of energies of mind decayed and faded; as tattered banners and broken helmets tell of ſome valiant arm laid low!</p>
               <p>As Mental ſtood with his arms folded, leaning againſt the wainſcot, Sir James and Mr Sandall al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately fixed an eye of wonder on the apartment and its myſterious owner. After a conſiderable ſilence—</p>
               <p>"Well, Mr. Sandall," ſaid Mental, "you are now in the very council chamber of your ſuppoſed ſecret committee!—You have my willing permiſſion to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect any paper, book, or drawer; and if the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this place, or any thing in it, ſuggeſts any queſtion, even of curioſity, I will as truly anſwer it as if I were on oath.</p>
               <p>"That piece of elm, covered with black cloth, was intended to be buried with the perſon whoſe name is inſcribed on the plate. I had ſome regard for her memory, and choſe to have it preſerved.—'Twas a ſtrange fancy, you may ſay—Be it ſo.</p>
               <p>"That ſtructure of bone, on the ſhelf over it, I alſo kept as a memorandum—It was once the repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory of much intelligence; and in thoſe ſockets once beamed eyes, which gliſtened with the dews of ſenſibility, and won the gazer's admiration ere their owner ſpoke. Yet, Sir, there was a ſomething contained within that ſkull, which plotted and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moſt miſchievous damnation that ever blaſted the tender bloſſoms of human hope!—I now gaze upon it by the hour, and wonder where the anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſpirit of the deſerted cavity has fled?—We can gather no intelligence of this nature, Mr. San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall. Science is ignorance, and genius madneſs, as to ſuch information.</p>
               <p>"That machine, whoſe electrical powers have amuſed me many a year, attracted for a while the powers of my reaſon; till, having gained a thorough
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:038596_0071_10129ECE92A452D8"/>
knowledge of its principles, my mind ſought novelty. The labours of chemiſtry kept me ſtill longer in play; till at length reſearch was ſatisfied. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing I can read, nothing I can ſtudy, reſolves me what I am!—whence I came!—or whither I ſhall go! This perplexity, may, and I know does, trouble me more than many men. I own, too, its inutility—Yet, be the torture of doubt its puniſhment; and let me not incur ſuſpicions that I do not merit. I know no Illuminati, Mr. Sandall."</p>
               <p>"Why, Sir, I—I—am ſurpriſed at—your odd ways. I—I—have no reaſon to doubt your good intentions—But it appears ſtrange, that a perſon of your ſenſe—that is, it is—as I may ſay—it is ſurpriſing"—ſtammered out Mr. Sandall—</p>
               <p>"Spare yourſelf, Sir," ſaid Mental—and I will ſpare you alſo; for I perceive you are not ſuch a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a man of any ſtrength of <hi>mind ought</hi> to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with. Therefore, though you are the means of <hi>again</hi> unſettling me—the buſy meddler that once more drives me from a ſpot I choſe to die on—yet I, atheiſt as you deem me, can be ſo much a chriſtian as to forgive you.</p>
               <p>"To you, Sir James, I owe a fuller explanation. In a few words then, Sir—I am a miſerable man!—whoſe views of happineſs have been almoſt conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſcured by unexpected blights and ſtorms, juſt as I thought them mine: and being of a frame and conſtitution, perhaps, ill ſuited to theſe buffetings of fortune, I find they have inflicted wounds upon my heart which have engendered a diſeaſe, whoſe baneful influence has made me ſeem the thing you ſee me—What I <hi>really</hi> am, is my own concern—But I am ſorry that, if by word or act, I have offended you; and I know I have.</p>
               <p>"You, Sir James, are happily not troubled with the mania of inquiry, and are content to take this world as you find it. I have too frequently indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a pettiſhneſs of mind at your expence, when I have aimed to decompoſe that order of things, and
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:038596_0072_10129ED0263CECD8"/>
ſyſtem of ſociety, with which I am diſſatisfied. Let me, then, make you the only recompenſe I can, by a ſolemn and ſincere aſſurance, that what I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently uttered in your preſence, has been the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of a diſtorted fancy—a ſickly heart—a feveriſh, giddy brain.—Let me aſſure you, Sir, I am no wiſer man, becauſe I can detect an error in another's creed—I am no happier man, becauſe I laugh at others' hopes of future life and bliſs. No, no Sir; I know now leſs than when I was a boy: the learning and the ſciences of men have but confuſed the ſimple thoughts of nature; and as to happineſs—Ha!—ha!—ha!—(grinning horribly)—this world affords me no proſpect of peace; and as to futurity, my doubts obſcure all hope.</p>
               <p>"Thus much I owed to you, Sir James; but the ſuſpicions of this reverend gentleman are as ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as they are mean, and unbecoming that faith which teaches charity!"</p>
               <p>Sir James apologized. Mr. Sandall bowed, and ſtammered; and, after examining a few empty apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they retired.</p>
               <p>On their return home, the knight publiſhed Mr. Mental's innocence, and ſent a ſervant to his houſe with the articles found in the haunted aiſle.</p>

                     <p>"There reſided near our cottage, at Walworth, a youth of fortune, who viſited us, and became our intimate acquaintance. I ſoon diſcovered in him uncommon genius, and ardent feelings.</p>
                     <p>"This youth, with about ten or eleven others, of ſimilar diſpoſitions and talents, had formed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into a club, for the purpoſe of candid and free inquiry—I had the honor of being invited a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                     <p>"My friend poſſeſſing, from his fortune, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable influence with the club, his patronage pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured me a reſpect I otherwiſe was not entitled to; and I was elected their ſecretary. I ſay nothing of our labours, which were publiſhed at a joint ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and circulated with a zeal beyond deſcription.</p>
                     <p>"Experience however, has taught me one truth, that every ſtructure of morality or philoſophy we

raiſed upon the ruins of thoſe we overthrew, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſtand the teſt of practical experiment, and, are, many of them at leaſt, greater nuiſances in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety than thoſe we attempted to deſtroy.</p>
                     <p>"As ſecretary of this ſociety, my houſe became a ſort of rendezvous for its members. My Elinor and I were delighted at our good fortune in this reſpect, as it afforded us many hours of rational amuſement in the converſation of men of taſte and letters.</p>

He had a perſon of manly beauty; a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance expreſſive of the moſt tender ſympathies; his manners were engaging; his converſe truly cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating. We delighted in the company of Mr. Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, and he ſeemed to receive an equal ſatisfaction in our's—His gratitude for the humble entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment our roof afforded him was beyond all bounds. His paintings were the ornaments of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <p>"We paſſed the greater part of a year in a ſtate the neareſt to bliſs I ever ſaw on earth. Fortune ſeemed determined to heap her favours on us all at once; for in the courſe of this period Mr. Nutting, the grocer, died; and ſmitten with the injuſtice of poſſeſſing the fortune which Elinor's conduct beſtowed upon him, on his death bed made a will, by which ſhe regained her right to a property, that made us completely independent.</p>
                     <p>Now, mark the fickleneſs of fortune. Juſt as the ſun of proſperity was aſcending the meridian, and his beams had gilded a wide and beauteous landſcape of enchanting hopes, a little ſable cloud ſprung up, and floated in a corner of the hemiſphere. It ſailed towards my dwelling. It ſwelled as it drew near; it increaſed till the ſun was hidden from my ſight; and then deſcending, burſt upon my head, o'er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed all proſpects of the hopes I had beheld, and left me nothing to contemplate, ſave the fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſolations of deſpair!</p>

This was conviction; and all the powers of my reaſon fell beneath the impulſe of revenge—My hand indiſtinctively graſped a dagger that was near me—I ruſhed into the room, and, aiming a juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward at the ſeducer's heart, the curſed villain ſhrunk from my vengeance, and it fell on the poor, loſt Elinor!</p>

                     <p>"She was then in her coffin—I flew to it—I threw myſelf in agony upon it; nor would I quit it, till my ſtrange wiſh was gratified, in preſerving the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin lid, as a memento, to be ever in my ſight. Another was accordingly made.</p>
                     <p>"After her interment, I ſecluded myſelf ſome months from the world. Human nature ſuffered a degradation indeed in my eſtimation. I grew diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted with mankind, and with the ſyſtem of the

                     <p>"My cottage at Walworth now became frightful, every room reminded me of ſome happy ſcene! and brought to mind my Elinor!

                     <p>"After ſome time I determined to quit not only Walworth, but England; and went to reſide in America.</p>

               <p>THE departure of Mental from the abbey was ſoon buzzed around the country, and various ſtories were circulated concerning him.</p>
               <p>Whilſt curioſity, or the love of ſcandal, actuated the many, George felt his heart warmly intereſted in the fate of ſo unhappy a fellow creature, and ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed earneſtly for the power of alleviating his ſorrows.</p>
               <p>The tender hearted Eliza and the benevolent Mrs. Barnwell, to whom he had communicated the outlines of the melancholy tale, united in commiſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations for the ſufferings of a man, whoſe life, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt from infancy, had been marked by diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſorrow.</p>
               <p>"How much is he to be pitied!" ſaid Mrs. Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well:—"his heart torn with the keeneſt ſorrows, and his mind prevented by ſcepticiſm from repoſing in the conſolations of religion. Let his ſtory, my dear George, teach you the value of thoſe truths a departed ſaint early inſtilled into your mind, and never ſuffer the ſubtilty of eloquence to deſtroy thoſe impreſſions which chriſtianity has formed in your heart."</p>
               <p>"How unfortunate for him," ſaid George, "that doctrines, ſo admirably adapted to the human heart, ſhould have been preſented to his view in ſo diſtorted a ſhape as they were by the Nuttings. It ſurely is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> aſſuming too much, to attribute his rejection of all revelation to that circumſtance. Such a mind as Mental's would doubtleſs have received the <hi>uncorrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed principles</hi> of chriſtianity as congenial to its wants,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:038596_0081_10129EEA2C06B0E0"/>
and its expectations, and would not have remained, as at preſent, an unorganized maſs of uſeleſs energies, which are attracted to one center; but, flying off at all points, rouſe the imagination of the moſt painful doubts, and leave the heart unbenefited by their operations.</p>
               <p>"Your remarks are certainly juſt," replied Mrs. Barnwell; "and it affords me the greateſt pleaſure to hear ſuch obſervations fall from a ſon I am ſo ſoon to part with. In the long abſence we are to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, it will be no inconſiderable ſource of pleaſing reflection, that you leave us with ſuch ſentiments.</p>
               <p>"The ſcenes, in which you are about to perform a part, my George, are of a complexion that dazzle and intoxicate the mind; and you will have occaſion frequently to recur to thoſe principles for direction; let me hope you will ever make them your guide, and then, I am perſuaded, I ſhall never bluſh at the mention of my ſon."</p>
               <p>Converſations of a ſimilar nature frequently took place till the day of departure arrived, when George, with abundant proofs of the liberality of his uncle, quitted his hoſpitable roof, which ſtill remained the aſylum of his mother and Eliza.</p>
               <p>For the firſt time George entered the metropolis—for the firſt time, breathed the faſhionable air of Portland Place, where, Mr. Emery reſided.</p>
               <p>From the account George had received from Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal of the meanneſs and avarice of traders, he was not a little ſurpriſed to obſerve the elegant appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Mr. Emery's reſidence. His aſtoniſhment increaſed, when, upon admiſſion into the hall, he was ſurrounded by four or five ſtout, tall fellows in blue and ſilver, large bunches of flowers in their boſoms, and white cambric handkerchiefs in their hands. The youth was abſolutely confuſed, and felt ſome difficulty in perſuading thoſe gentlemen of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies to procure him an audience of Mr. Emery, who was entertaining the cabinet miniſters that evening at dinner, at his own table.</p>
               <p>They condeſcended, however, at length, to ſhow
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:038596_0082_10129EED4D544AE0"/>
him to a parlour, where, in about an hour afterwards, Mr. Emery came to him; George having ſent in his name.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of the merchant of the old ſchool George expected to meet, Mr. Emery was a man of the moſt elegant deportment, dreſſed in the extreme of faſhion.</p>
               <p>He entered the room in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtile ſo commanding, yet eaſy, that his preſence beſpoke the moſt accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed manners.</p>
               <p>"I am extremely concerned, Sir," ſaid he "that very particular people are with me to day, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent my receiving you more agreeably with my wiſhes, and the reſpect due to a nephew of Sir James Barnwell. Allow me, however, to congratulate you upon your ſafe arrival, and to introduce you to Mrs. Emery and her daughters."</p>
               <p>George apologized for his appearance, and would have avoided the introduction.</p>
               <p>O, by no means, ſaid Mr. Emery, ringing—In what part of the houſe is your miſtreſs, ſaid he to the ſervant who appeared.</p>
               <p>The ladies have drove down to the pavilion this morning, Sir; and do not return till to-morrow.</p>
               <p>That's unfortunate, indeed: but you will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe me, I'm ſure; we ſhall be better acquainted ſoon, and apologies will become unneceſſary.—William, ſerve dinner in this room to my friend Mr. Barnwell, and tell the butler to bring what wine he orders.</p>
               <p>With a cordial ſhake of the hand, Mr. Emery left his young friend to a ſoliloquy, full of wonder, at the ſcenes before him. The manner in which he was received aſtoniſhed him:—Cabinet miniſters dining with a merchant—was a novelty to him; but more ſtrange than every thing elſe, appeared to him the idea of a man's not knowing whether his wife and daughters were at home, or in the country.</p>
               <p>A profuſe dinner was ſerved up, conſiſting of every delicacy that the ſeaſon afforded, and in a ſtile of legance beyond all George had ever ſeen.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="unknown:038596_0083_10129EF069362FA8"/>
It was near ten o'clock when he had finiſhed his ſumptuous dinner; and about eleven, he was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of retiring to reſt, when Mr. Emery entered, introducing a young man, apparently about twenty, of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> countenance and delicate frame.</p>
               <p>"Mr. Barnwell," ſaid he, "this is a pupil of mine. Mr. Rigby, let me recommend Mr. Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to your friendſhip: I have mentioned him to you before."</p>
               <p>"I ſhall be very proud of rendering you any ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Sir," ſaid Mr. Rigby.</p>
               <p>Mr. Emery retired, calling to the ſervants in the hall—"The chariot in a quarter of an hour."</p>
               <p>The pupils were left together. What a contraſt did they form! George's cheeks glowed with health—Rigby's were ſunk, and pale; George's form and and limbs proclaimed the temperance and exerciſe he uſed—Rigby's ſlender legs and ſhrivelled arms as plainly declared a life of ſloth and intemperance. The dreſs of the former was ſimple and manly—that of the latter, diſguſtingly effeminate: his whole appearance prejudiced George againſt him, whilſt he in return conſidered George as a boor.</p>
               <p>—"The chariot in a quarter of an hour" was echoed three or four times in the hall.</p>
               <p>George could not refrain from aſking whether any thing particular drew Mr. Emery abroad ſo late.</p>
               <p>"So late!—Eh, demme!—that's neat—Excuſez moi—Upon my ſoul I can't help laughing!"—which laughing was merely a hectic barking. Why, my dear fellow, you muſt be very raw—very green, indeed!—excuſez—moi—its not eleven!"—whirling a gold watch round by the chain—"The Principal's only going his uſual round."</p>
               <p>"May I be ſo free as to inquire, what you mean by that phraſe, Mr. Rigby?—I believe you know I am a ſtranger in London."</p>
               <p>"O yes—excuſez moi—that's plain enough! However, one ſhould not be too ſevere—I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber when I—I—I—was as great a quiz—excuſez
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:038596_0084_10129EF47A3496C8"/>
moi—as you, Sir—By going his round—I mean, looking in at the opera—ſqueezing a few <hi>figurante</hi>—lounging in the way of the ſcene-ſhifters, and getting hiſſed off the ſtage. Then whirl to Lady Srongbox—Splaſh away the Spaniſh—make an aſſignation for the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—and off again to the Houſe—take a lounge there for an hour—get a bow from the Treaſury Bench—gape at Doctor Sceptic's doubts—and then to Brookes's—loſe a trifle—get the head-ach—and daſh home with two flambeaux by day light!"</p>
               <p>"You are very happy at a deſcription, Mr. Rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by," ſaid George:—"a little ad libitum in the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours though, I preſume."</p>
               <p>"No, demme, not I—I'm a plain matter of fact, abſolutely. But what are you going to do with yourſelf till bed-time?"</p>
               <p>"That time is come with me, Sir, for I am fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued."</p>
               <p>"To bed at eleven o'clock—O, horrible! For heaven's ſake ſham ſick, my good fellow—ſham ſick—or the ſervants will die with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>George ſmiled; Mr. Rigby ſuppoſed, at his wit: it was, in fact, at his folly.</p>
               <p>How wide a field for reflection did the incidents of the laſt few hours open to a mind like George's, ever active and diſcerning, and—"never leſs alone, than when alone."</p>

               <p>FROM the ſpecimens he had ſeen on the day of his arrival, George was prepared to expect a very

different ſtyle of living, from that which he had an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated in the country, and ſuch was the reality.</p>
               <p>He was eſtabliſhed in Mr. Emery's houſe in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city rather of a private ſecretary than a clerk. Inſtead of being confined from an early hour in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing till late at night, in poſting ledgers, and copying invoices, as Sir James had taught him to expect, and as was th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> caſe with all merchants' clerks when Sir James was in trade, George found that the ſons, or nephews, or couſins of merchants, who threw a capital into the firm, under-went no ſuch drudgery, which is conſigned to boys who had learnt to write fine hands at charity ſchools.</p>
               <p>About eleven o'clock George uſually went from Portland Place to the 'compting-houſe, Broad Street Buildings, where Mr. Drudge, the <hi>fagging</hi> partner, reſided. Any communications of conſequence, betwixt Mr. Emery and Mr. Drudge, were convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by George; as well as papers that required the ſignature of the former, who ſeldom viſited the count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe himſelf.</p>
               <p>From Broad Street Buildings to Batſon's coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe was a regular one o'clock walk for George, where he met the rich Jew brokers, and made Mr. Emery's propoſals for the barter of bullion, conſols, omnium, or lottery, according to previous inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which, from his intimacy with miniſters, gave generally the tone to the market.</p>
               <p>At three he paraded the Royal Exchange, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited the foreign merchants to dine in Portland Place, which completed the labours of the day; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept upon particular occaſions, when letters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence were to be copied, or memorials for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts ſent to the Treaſury.</p>
               <p>Such a ſlender portion of employ, left void a large ſpace of time for his own inclination to fill up.</p>
               <p>It being but the commencement of the ſeaſon, Mrs. Emery and her daughters were ſeldom in town; and Mr. Emery was ſcarcely viſible in his own houſe, except at a few dinners, ſurrounded by company.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:038596_0086_10129EF93743A0F8"/>
Mr. Rigby, in addition to an extreme oppoſition of taſte and purſuits, had the motives of jealouſy and envy to render George diſguſtful to him; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, beyond the ceremonials of occaſional meetings, they never ſpoke to each other.</p>
               <p>Thus leiſure, for a conſiderable time, was alſo ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude to George, who had refuſed ſeveral invitations to viſits, for the vulgar reaſon of not liking the party.</p>
               <p>A well ſtored library was his uſual lounge after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and in the evening he amuſed himſelf with mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic, or drawing; in a familiar correſpondence with his ſiſter; and occaſionally in attempts at poetry, of which he was fond to exceſs.</p>
               <p>The library of Mr. Emery compriſed an aſſemblage of literature in all its branches, and the privilege of acceſs to ſuch a ſtore was, perhaps, the greateſt happineſs George had ever experienced.</p>
               <p>Having, one afternoon, finiſhed reading Dr. Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory's life of the unfortunate Chatterton, he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in tears by the ſervant who brought him his tea and the evening papers.</p>
               <p>George haſtily ſnatched up the newſpaper, to conceal his emotion, and caſt his eyes rapidly over its contents.</p>
               <p>Whilſt his heart beat indignant at the fate of Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terton, a paragraph preſented itſelf, in which the enormous ſums paid in one ſeaſon to Didelot and his wife for dancing at the opera were enumerated.</p>
               <p>"Good God!" exclaimed he, when left to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, "how ſmall a portion of this wealth might have ſaved to England, and to the world, another Milton!"</p>
               <p>His ardent mind purſued the melancholy thought, and he penned the following ſonnet:</p>

               <p>Such were his purſuits, ſuch his propenſities; a conduct ſo different from other young men of his age, was the ſource of ridicule all over the houſe. The footmen, as they picked their teeth after din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, "wondered where the devil the Hottentot was bred?" The maids "never ſaw ſuch an inſipid creature in their lives—ſuppoſed he had left his heart behind him, if, indeed, he ever had any;" whilſt Mrs. Jennings, the houſekeeper, vowed "that ſhe verily believed, for her part, that he was ſent into the houſe as a ſpy upon their conduct."</p>
               <p>This latter ſuſpicion arouſed the jealous reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the butler, and the whole <hi>corps domeſtique</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon a war of indolence againſt him, which, however, the engaging ſuavity of his manners ſoon converted into the homage of grateful reſpect.</p>
               <p>Such was the ſituation of George, when orders arrived from the Pavilion to prepare the houſe for the reception of its miſtreſs during winter.</p>
               <p>Though, to the <hi>ruſticated</hi> mind of George, every apartment ſeemed an aſſemblage of ſplendid <hi>unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries,</hi> yet every apartment was thrown into confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the addition or exchange of ſofas, cabriolets, tripods, chandeliers, and chimney ornaments, as if the houſe, for the firſt time, was to be furniſhed.</p>

               <p>George was never ſo confuſed in his life, as at the abrupt volubility of this lady. He was thinking how to reply to her ſtring of queſtions, when all of a ſudden, ſhe exclaimed—"O, pray do me the favour to write a note to the Counteſs of Codrington, to ſay we are come to town, and mean to be at the opera to night; and do me the favour to write to the Duch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs of—O, no—now I think of it, it will be quite delightful to take them all by ſurpriſe—and I'll poſitively frighten them all out of their ſenſes. Come, Emma—Come, Charlotte, looking at her watch, "we have juſt time enough to drive round the ſquares before we dreſs;" and away they flew, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing George in a ſtate of perfect aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>At dinner he ſaw them again, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſurveyed the Miſs Emerys. They were mere faſhionables; their countenances rather pretty than handſome, without any traces of intelligence or ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. The youngeſt poſſeſſed moſt vivacity, and
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:038596_0089_10129F01F58BBF98"/>
the eldeſt more ſenſe; the former loved laughter, but the delight of the latter was ſcandal.</p>
               <p>As they were reputed fortunes, they were not without admirers, whom they both kept in that doubting ſtate of vaſſalage, ſo pleaſing to the vanity of the giddy part of the fair ſex, but at which a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of virtue and underſtanding revolts.</p>
               <p>By the attention of Lord Morley to Miſs Emery, and the Rev. Mr. Eaſtwood to Miſs Charlotte, George eaſily diſcovered the favourites of the day.</p>
               <p>The hour for the opera arrived; the carriages were ordered; each of the favoured lovers handed his idol to his own chariot, whilſt Mr. Emery's was reſerved for Mrs. Emery and her new friend, George, of whom ſhe affected to be extravagantly fond! and kindly undertook to lead him through all the mazes of the high world.</p>
               <p>When they entered the magnificent ſtructure of the opera houſe, which was extremely crouded, George was abſolutely overcome by the ſtrength of the new impreſſions which ſo ſudden a blaze of ſplendor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reated.</p>
               <p>The opera was over, and the overtures of the bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let was performing. Upon a mind taſteful by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and uncommonly ſuſceptible, charms of muſic were not loſt. While every one elſe had ſeated themſelves in the box, and were buſily employed in nodding round the brilliant circle, exchanging looks of ſmiling affability, and at the ſame moment whiſpering mutual calumnies, George ſtood abſorbed in exquiſite ſenſations. A tittering ſort of laugh arouſed him, and he found he had been the laughing ſtock of the party.</p>
               <p>"In the name of wonder," cried Lord Morley, "what have you found ſo petrifying?"</p>
               <p>"Why, child," ſaid Mrs. Emery, "you have uſed an attitude in the wrong place. Nobody ever liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to the overtures; and as to being aſtoniſhed, you muſt remember its the vulgareſt thing in the world to be ſurpriſed at any thing one ſees!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:038596_0090_10129F038E2F0310"/>
"Poſſibly," ſaid Mr. Eaſtwood, "this is Mr. Barnwell's firſt appearance in this character."</p>
               <p>George aſſented.</p>
               <p>"O, monſtrous!" ſcreamed Mrs. Emery. "Thou brute!—A month in London and not one night at the opera! How can you have poſſibly amuſed your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf?" ſaid Lord Morley. "Have tragedy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edy entirely engroſſed you?"</p>
               <p>He had not ſeen either.</p>
               <p>"Mercy on me," exclaimed Mrs. Emery, "what a taſk have I undertaken!—<hi>Mon petit enfant,</hi> come, tell your mama what you really have ſeen, and what you really do know."</p>
               <p>Such was the trifling that prevented George from paying any attention to the muſic or dancers.</p>
               <p>For what purpoſe do ſo many perſons aſſemble here? thought he. The entertainments of the orcheſtra or ſtage might certainly as well be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omitted, as ſo ſlightly attended to. All that he had been permitted to ſee or hear, only ſerved to excite his curioſity, and determined him to take an early opportunity of viſiting the theatre alone.</p>
               <p>As they were leaving their box—"I muſt relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh going to the Ducheſs's delightful party to night," ſaid Mrs. Emery, "or diſmiſs my <hi>noviciate;</hi> for poſitively, George, you would diſgrace me. Beſides nobody knows you. I ſhould have imagined Mr. Emery might, at leaſt, have introduced you to a few faſhionables. But he is ſo neceſſary to the miniſters. Do you think they'll give him a coronet, my Lord?" turning to Lord Morley.</p>
               <p>"I know they can refuſe him nothing," ſaid Lord Morley.</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid Mrs. Emery, after a pauſe, "I ſhall certainly diſmiſs you, George. And merely for your ſake, I'll poſitively give a route on Thurſday, (though its abominable early in the ſeaſon) aſk all the world, and introduce you myſelf to every body. So, go—go your ways."—George parried theſe blows very well; for, though unlearnt in the faſhionable jargon
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:038596_0091_10129F08F9CC8240"/>
of the beau monde, he was wanting neither in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel deportment, or even an elegant and agreeable manner of expreſſing his ideas, which were ſuperior, beyond all compariſon, to the united efforts of his party.</p>
               <p>As he was making his bow to Mrs. Emery, at the chariot door, three gentlemen, walking abreaſt, puſhed the ſoldiers on one ſide, and were paſſing on, when Mrs. Emery's carriage attracted their no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and they ſtopped to pay their reſpects:—"O Middleton," ſaid the lady, "are you here?"</p>
               <p>"We've juſt looked in," ſaid a florid face man, with an amazing large cocked hat, and an inſolent air:—"but, who the devil's that Quiz?" in a whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
               <p>"A very particular friend of Mr. Emery's juſt eſcaped from rural fetters. Have a little compaſſion on him, for our ſakes. George," continued ſhe, "this is Captain Middleton; he wiſhes the pleaſure of your acquaintance?" and the carriage whirled off.</p>
               <p>George now found himſelf in a new ſociety. Captain Middleton took his arm in as familiar a ſtyle as if they were old acquaintances, and began a ſort of catechiſm, and ſoon diſcovered his own moſt libertine principles, and proved to him the unſullied mind of his new acquaintance.</p>
               <p>It was a dark night, and began to rain; a hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney coach was called, and orders given to drive to St. James's Street. They alighted at a coffee houſe; and George, having acknowledged that he had no engagement, felt compelled to ſit down with them to ſupper. Wine was quaffed in goblets, laughter expelled thought, and was kept up by a continued ſeries of obſcene merriment.</p>
               <p>Unaccuſtomed to ſuch ſcenes, George performed his part but indifferently. It was the firſt time in his life he had ever liſtened to an unbridled ridicule of religion and morality. Religion was abſolutely ſcouted; and as to what was, or was not morality, it was ſo indefinable to the comprehenſion of thoſe wits, that according to their ſyſtem, a man of liberal
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:038596_0092_10129F0A906AED38"/>
ideas had no other guide for his conduct than his own convenience.</p>
               <p>As the wine circulated through their veins, their ſtories gained a richer colouring, and their principles became more naked.</p>
               <p>In this ſituation was placed a youth of ſeventeen, whoſe heart had hitherto ever beat in uniſon with reaſon. It had known no irregular deſires; had never felt the fire of luſt, or cheriſhed any inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unſanctioned by his head. Yet was his heart not ſtoic; it was open, generous; glowing with good will to all around him. Thence ſprung that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral wiſh, ſo fatal in its effects, to accommodate his conduct to his company—<hi>to do as others do.</hi> To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe a glaſs, is frequently to refuſe a toaſt; and to refuſe ſome toaſts, would ſo impeach a man's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, that he would be for ever after pointed at as a monſter of virtue!</p>
               <p>George was too good natured to refuſe his wine, and too unaccuſtomed to its effects to keep pace with his companions. The conſequences were, inſenſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity for the night, and a moſt inveterate head-ach in the morning, with reflections more painful to his mind than any he had hitherto experienced.</p>

               <p>EVERY ſucceeding day now brought with it ſome novelty. The route at Mrs. Emery's was as ſplendid as any in London, and as crouded as her ambition could deſire.</p>
               <p>At this route George was introduced to a numerous hoſt of perſonages, male and female; and their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious titles, names, and deſcriptions, danced in his
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:038596_0093_10129F0D676AAAF0"/>
brain the whole night: yet amongſt them all there was but one for whoſe further acquaintance he felt the leaſt inclination.</p>
               <p>A very genteel young man, in mourning, who with his two ſiſters were introduced under the names of Mr. and the Miſs Lambtons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had left a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable impreſſion upon his mind.</p>
               <p>His manners would have paſſed, with many, as proudly forbidding; but George, with more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, ſaw in them the effects of a dignified re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
               <p>His converſation was elegant, and rational. He appeared to poſſeſs a conſiderable knowledge of the world, and to be familiar with the etiquette of the higher circles.</p>
               <p>The Miſs Lambtons were pleaſing and intelligent young women.</p>
               <p>Having paſſed an hour in delightful converſe with Mr. Lambton, George felt extremely concerned at his departure; and the more ſo, as not the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant hint of a ſecond meeting fell from his lips.</p>
               <p>Upon inquiring, he learned from Mrs. Emery, that this gentleman was the ſon of a deceaſed Welch ſquire, who had left his children the fame of a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hoſpitality, in return for having frittered away, almoſt to nothing, his eſtate.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lambton was ſtudying the law; and his ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who had juſt arrived from Wales, at preſent reſided with him in town, and were entirely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent upon his generoſity.</p>
               <p>George ſighed to think, that the only individual he had met with in London, whoſe friendſhip he ſhould wiſh to cultivate, he might in all probability never behold again.</p>
               <p>He was agreeably diſappointed. A few days af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the route there was a maſquerade at the opera houſe. Mrs. Emery had engaged George to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her, and a party was accordingly formed.</p>
               <p>They had ſcarcely entered the room, when a black domino, with two females under his care, advanced
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:038596_0094_10129F0F00014820"/>
Mrs. Emery, with her uſual volubility, was trying the patience of George juſt as this party paſſed.</p>
               <p>"I have heard that voice before," ſaid the black domino, to his companions.</p>
               <p>George inſtantly recollected Mr. Lambton's voice, which was confirmed by the reply of his ſiſters. Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing carefully his dreſs, he determined, if fate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him of his patroneſs, to make himſelf known.</p>
               <p>Lord Morley and Miſs Emery came running out of breath, to acquaint them that there was a moſt ſingular character at the other end of the room.</p>
               <p>Mr. Eaſtwood and Miſs Charlotte Emery arrived with a confirmation of the ſame intelligence. At the ſame inſtant Captain Middleton appeared, and Mrs. Emery taking hold of his arm, relinquiſhing George's, he made his eſcape, and went in purſuit of Mr. Lambton. In a few minutes he diſcovered him; and walking a ſmall diſtance behind him, liſtened to his voice again, that he might be confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his opinion.</p>
               <p>"Well, then, my girls," ſaid Lambton, for 'twas he, "maſquerades will not be among the number of thoſe indulgencies you may ſigh to think a parent's indiſcretions have deprived you of. What but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity of mind can find pleaſure in a ſcene like this? Are you not already tired with it?"</p>
               <p>George was now convinced; and walking up to him, reſpectfully ſaid—"Am I miſtaken—or have I the pleaſure of addreſſing Mr. Lambton?"</p>
               <p>"My name is Lambton, Sir; but I have to learn that of the perſon who honors me with his notice."</p>
               <p>"Barnwell," replied George, unmaſking.</p>
               <p>Lambton bowed, and preſented his ſiſters.</p>
               <p>"I muſt abſolutely offer a ſacrifice to chance for this unexpected good fortune," ſaid Barnwell. "I think it ſo long ſince I had the pleaſure of your converſation, that I began to deſpair of its renewal."</p>
               <p>"Do you expect me to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>reply ſincerely, or faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ionably, to ſo handſome a compliment?" ſaid Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:038596_0095_10129F1333B7BB18"/>
"That will depend, I apprehend upon your own opinion, of which I am moſt likely to be pleaſed with; though, if my own aſſertion will paſs for any thing, I prefer ſincerity, and yet deſire to receive no greater than I beſtow."</p>
               <p>"Am I to underſtand then, that reſiding with the moſt faſhionable Commoners, in the metropolis, with the moſt eaſy acceſs to every amuſement it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, you can find leiſure and inclination for ſo dull an employment as converſation?"</p>
               <p>"I am happy to find you do not judge of me per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally, but relatively."</p>
               <p>A pauſe enſued.</p>
               <p>"I am ſurpriſed to ſee ſo few characters," ſaid George.</p>
               <p>I am rather ſurpriſed at the contraſt for the real and aſſumed character of the metamorphoſes we have. What, for inſtance, ſhould you ſuppoſe was the real character of that prim Quaker!—The dreſs of puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conceals one of the moſt celebrated votaries of impure pleaſure in this city. With the imbecility of accelerated old age is combined the folly and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation of youth.</p>
               <p>He has the diſpoſal of immenſe wealth, which he laviſhes upon the loweſt objects of pollution; yet, to diſcharge a juſt debt is painful to him.</p>
               <p>He diſgraces the patrician order, by having been born to a dukedom; nay, he leſſens the dignity of human nature, by ſhewing that the ſpirit of a Satyr may animate the reſemblance of a man.</p>
               <p>"Miſerable old man!" cried George.</p>
               <p>And yet, obſerve how his company is ſought af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. His riches procure him the attention of a train of paraſites, whoſe praiſe is infamy, but which he, poor man, gratefully receives, as the only ſubſtitute for thoſe pleaſing ſenſations, which play about the heart where virtue is reſpected.</p>
               <p>That fine form in the veſt of a Nun, who ſeems ſo deſirous of attracting the Quaker's attention, is one of the wildeſt daughters of faſhionable levity,
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:038596_0096_10129F174A2555F8"/>
Her parents are reſpectable and opulent citizens; but Matilda unfortunately has an aunt, who is a widow of quality, with whom ſhe reſides at a diſtance from parental obſervation. If ſhe has not yet abſolutely bartered virtue for pleaſure, ſhe cannot juſtly be ſurpriſed that the world has already attached that infamy to her character, which ſhe ſo ſedulou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ly courts.</p>
               <p>You will obſerve, that if ſhe fails in obtaining the notice of the Cyprian Quaker, which would be the climax of notoriety, that ſhe will attack at leaſt half the young men in the room, be familiar with each, and tells them all, that ſhe perfectly deſpiſes the laſt ſhe flirted with.</p>
               <p>"How much to be pitied!" ſaid George.</p>
               <p>How much more to be blamed! replied Lamb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton: for, though we make every allowance for an improper education, what can palliate ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible thirſt for admiration. Her errors are not the offspring of nature, but a mean and diſguſting ſelf-vanity, which impeaches her heart as well as her underſtanding. I can admit the volatility of youthful blood as an excuſe for vivacity; but where that is natural, it never permits a diſguiſe.</p>
               <p>Matilda is a miſtreſs of cunning, and to obtain notoriety, would ſacrifice the feelings of half man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>It would be a taſk for the night to enumerate the uneaſineſs ſhe has occaſioned in various families the diſcord ſhe has fomented betwixt friends and lovers. But ſee, ſhe has relinquiſhed the Quaker in deſpair, and is croſſing herſelf in the attitude of ſupplication before a Monk.</p>
               <p>"And does your information extend to a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his reality?"</p>
               <p>"He is the ſon of a courtier; a young man whoſe acquaintance is covetted by ſuch as prefer a warm and luxurious deſcription of obſcene incidents to ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional converſation. He has travelled, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to you the intrigues of convents in ſuch glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

language, as delights the depraved taſte of ſuch of his company as would be fatigued to death with any thing intellectual. I believe, in general, his ſtories are credited; but for my own part I cannot help a little ſcepticiſm, that makes me revolt at nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſo full of the marvellous. In fact, I have heard well informed people ſay, that in the company of men of ſenſe, he will himſelf laugh at the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity and falſe taſte of his dupes."</p>
               <p>"Do you obſerve a very well ſuſtained reſemblance of the Tragic Muſe?" ſaid George.</p>
               <p>"It is an exception to my former remark," repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lambton;—"and is ſupported by an amiable woman, as melancholy at all ſeaſons as ſhe now appears.

               <p>"Her ambition was a title. The Earl of—wanted materials to repair an impoveriſhed eſtate, and poſſeſſed art ſufficient to intangle her judgment.

               <p>"The frivolous part of her former acquaintance ſhun her with ſilly ſcorn; and the more ſenſible and ſincere few, who ſtill viſit her, can afford her little elſe than their pity; the conſolations of which, a dignified mind like her's would much rather diſpenſe with.</p>

               <p>"How much I am obliged by your communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions," ſaid George, "and how much would my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to London, and its <hi>Harlequinades</hi> be ſoftened, could I have recourſe to the intelligence of ſuch a mind. Why are the terms friend, and friendſhip, become ſo ridiculouſly unmeaning," continued George, "that, whilſt one's heart is prompted to confeſs its attachment, the force of ridicule repels the generous inſtinct?"</p>
               <p>"But for this, Mr. Lambton, I would not heſitate to aſk a probation of my profeſſions; and am not without hope that I ſhould obtain your regard."</p>
               <p>"Its well the party you have left do not overhear you," ſaid Lambton. "Had Captain Middleton heard ſuch a ſentimental ſpeech, you would never have been admitted into any of his parties; and the rejection would have marked you for a milk-ſop all the reſt of your life."</p>
               <p>"Would to God he had been here, then," cried George.</p>
               <p>"Softly, young man," ſaid Lambton; "you are not ſufficiently aware of the evil you ſo bravely ſpurn. Could you be content to be ſneered at by the men, and laughed at by the women of your acquaintance?"</p>
               <p>"Would <hi>all</hi> my acquaintance," ſaid George, arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "act ſo abſurdly?"</p>
               <p>"I perceive your alluſion," ſaid Lambton, ſmiling, "but you are too young for a philoſopher—What comes here?" continued he.</p>
               <p>A maſk now approached, followed by a crowd, which his ſtrange dreſs, and ſtill more ſtrange beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour attracted.—He appeared as a Hermit.</p>

               <p>Captain Middleton, Mrs. Emery and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, with Lord Morley and Mr. Eaſtwood, were among the followers of the Hermit.</p>

               <p>"Inſects, away!" cried the Hermit, in a voice which George immediately recollected to be Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal's. "Inſects, away!—Ye flies of faſhion!—Ye fluttering nothings!—Devoid of thought—caprice impels, or folly leads your ſteps.

               <p>"Do you know him, then?" ſaid Lambton.</p>

               <p>Imperceptibly his mind became moulded into a compliance with faſhionable life, and his manners aſſimilated to its modes; yet ſtill the native purity of his principles remained unſhaken: honour ſtill glowed in his breaſt, and ſincerity dwelt on his tongue.</p>
               <p>He had now paſſed his ſeventeenth year, though the expreſſion of his features, and his manly perſon, made him appear conſiderably older.</p>
               <p>About this time Mr. Freeman wrote Mr. Emery intelligence of his intention to comply with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and permit his daughter to viſit the metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis; and added, that he meant himſelf to accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny her to town.</p>
               <p>The agitation of Mr. Emery at this intelligence ſurpriſed George extremely. Uneaſineſs of mind became evident in every tranſaction. He would order the chariot, and forget his orders <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

employ George to copy ſtatements of accounts, which he would alter as frequently as if it depended upon his fancy to arrange the figures.</p>
               <p>Mr. Drudge, the acting partner, was cloſeted with him for hours together. Letters after letters were diſpatched to the Treaſury; and anxiety was expreſſed in his looks, words, and actions.</p>
               <p>At length Mr. Freeman and his daughter arrived. The latter was a beautiful girl, about the age of ſeventeen.</p>
               <p>George, who happened to be with Mr. Emery when their chaiſe ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> them—"He's here, by G—! Then there's nothing for it but deception!"</p>
               <p>In a moment the chagrin of his countenance was half concealed by an hypocritical ſmile of welcome.</p>
               <p>"Well," cried Mr. Freeman, as he ſtumped through the hall, leaning on a gold headed cane "Well, Maſter Emery, here am I, once more, in London. Upon my conſcience, but you've an elegant houſe here. Aye, and here are my old ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintances, Emma and Charlotte. Why, they are grown out of mind; and ſo fine too—why, Maria," to his daughter "our country clothes will make our faſhionable friends here bluſh for us. Where is my ward, Georgina? and where is young Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well?"</p>
               <p>Congratulations and embraces now took place; and about ſix o'clock the ſervant announced dinner.</p>
               <p>"Dinner!" exclaimed Mr. Freeman: "by my credit, but I'm ſhocked! What have you not din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed! Well, well—I ſuppoſe its the faſhion."</p>
               <p>By deſign, Mr. Emery had no party that day. As they were at dinner—"And, pray, how go things now in London. Have ſugars advanced as much as was expected?"</p>
               <p>"Sir,—Eh—ſugars—" cried Emery, and looked ſignificantly at George.</p>
               <p>George anſwered the queſtion.</p>

Mr. Emery, fearful of more queſtions, began talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf.</p>
               <p>"Have you heard how many millions Mr. Pitt wants?"</p>
               <p>"No," replied Mr. Freeman; "nor I don't care."</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon," ſaid Emery; "but it will make ſome material difference to us, that I happened <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"What market?" ſaid Mr. Freeman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Emery appeared confuſed.</p>
               <p>"I mean," ſaid he, "the funds. You are aware, that during the war, part of our capital would lie dead, were it not for the opportunities offered by loans.</p>
               <p>"Why, truly," ſaid Mr. Freeman, "loans, or thoſe things, I don't know much about. Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize in my younger days, conſiſted in imports and exports; a good cargo outwards, or homewards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"I'm afraid they are," ſaid Mr. Freeman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically.</p>
               <p>After dinner Mr. Freeman, Mr. Emery, and George, were left to themſelves. Mr. Emery drank glaſs after glaſs till he ſeemed to have conquered his feelings, and George thought proper to leave them together.</p>
               <p>They ſoon, however, joined the ladies in the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing room, and were ſcarcely ſeated, when Lord Morley was announced.</p>

"Lord who?" cried Mr. Freeman. "Why, you did not ſay you expected any Lords."</p>
               <p>"O dear, Sir," ſaid Mrs. Emery, "they tire us to death with their freedom."</p>
               <p>"Either, then, the dignity of a nobleman is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed, or the conſequence of Maſter Emery con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably advanced," ſaid Mr. Freeman.</p>

               </p>

               <p>"I have ſeen him," ſaid his lordſhip.</p>
               <p>"Bravo!—Bravo!" cried Mr. Freeman, rubbing his hands. "He is a brave and gallant fellow, and I am glad of it with all my heart; and hope it won't be long before they ſend him upon another <hi>blazing</hi> expedition againſt their navy."</p>
               <p>Lord Morley ſtared—"Blazing expedition!—Navy!—You'll pardon me, Sir; but, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Why, I'm alluding to Sir Sidney Smith, who you ſay has eſcaped from the French."</p>
               <p>"Sir Sidney!—the devil!" exclaimed his lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:038596_0104_10129F2EC1598CF0"/>
"No, Sir, I do not concern myſelf about any ſuch gunpowder gentry. I—Sir—am alluding to that dear delightful creature—Monſieur Caperonis—the firſt dancer in Europe."</p>
               <p>"Pſha!" ſaid Mr. Freeman; "is that your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant intelligence?"</p>
               <p>"Delightful!—Charming!—charming!"—cried Mrs. and the Miſs Emerys.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Mr. Eaſtwood now entered the room: his pretty features ſcrewed into a ſimper—twirling an eye glaſs in his hand, which was ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded gracefully round his neck by a purple ribband; a white Cambrick handkerchief hung half out of his pocket; his left toe juſt touched the ground, and he ſtood the complete image of the moſt diſguſting character in the world—"a clerical fop!"</p>
               <p>"Have they impoſed upon me, my dear Lord Morley, or is it really true—The Caperonis—is he really arrived?"</p>
               <p>The converſation flowed now ſolely in this chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and Mr. Freeman, evidently diſguſted, ſtrolled out of the room, and Mr. Emery followed him.</p>
               <p>The ladies engroſſed Maria to themſelves; and George could only now and then make a remark. When, however, he had that opportunity, the ſenſe or feeling of his obſervations was eagerly noticed by Maria, who failed not to contraſt them, to their advantage, with the inſipidity and impertinence of the reſt of the party.</p>
               <p>The appearance of Lambton was a relief to Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, who called by appointment, to introduce him that evening to one of Mr. Heaviſide's converzazioni.</p>
               <p>"What a comfortable eſcape," ſaid George to his friend; "and yet theſe are the beings ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically ſtiled, by Shakeſpear, the <hi>'makers of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners!'</hi>—Well may our manners be vapid Here, however," continued he, as they entered Mr. Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſide's theatre, "we ſhall meet minds of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent mould."</p>
               <p>Mr. Lambton found pleaſure in anſwering the queſtions of George concerning what he ſaw, for
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:038596_0105_10129F30521A1FF0"/>
he was perfectly well read in the theory of anatomy, and was in the habit of intimacy with ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional men. Among a group that were aſſembled round the fire, he pointed out to him a young man, as a poet of uncommon genius.</p>
               <p>"He has the fire of Milton," ſaid he; "but wants judgment. His writings reſemble a wild, uncultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſpot of ground, where the moſt beautiful produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature occaſionally ſurpriſe and delight the eye, but wanting the uniformity of deſign, and arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of taſte, fail in making any laſting impreſſion on the fancy. It is exactly ſo with the works of that young enthuſiaſt, who has publiſhed already enough to raiſe the higheſt ideas of what he might have been, and at the ſame time to ſhow the world, that he will never reach that eminence.</p>
               <p>"I perceive," continued he, "he is now deba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting moſt vehemently. We will join the party; but let me firſt guard you againſt the warmth of his language and ſentiments. He is a democrat from feeling. The French revolution burſt upon his opening mind like a new created ſun, and the rays of the new philoſophy have ſo dazzled his diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that his mind, enlightened only on one ſide, can diſcover neither beauty or truth out of the new ſyſtem."</p>
               <p>They joined the group, which conſiſted of ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral celebrated characters—George, all ear, liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened with avidity to the converſation, and felt a real delight when it was propoſed to adjourn to a tavern, to ſupper.</p>
               <p>During ſupper the converſation was general, and not very intereſting, but when the waiters withdrew, and the glaſſes were placed on the table, George's heart beat high with expectation. When he ſaw ſuch celebrated characters ſeated with himſelf at the ſame board, he almoſt debated with himſelf, which he deſired to hear moſt <hi>drawn out:</hi> and juſtly imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, that, moſt probably, he ſhould never behold ſuch another meeting, he hoped they would <hi>all</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the converſation.</p>

                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:038596_0106_10129F3322D966E8"/>
How unſtable are human hopes! The young poet, whoſe ardent fancy had formed ſome hundred lines, which he preſented to the managers of the theatre, as a tragedy, now appealed to the company for their opinion of his production. Then pulling out a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle from his pocket, he began reading his tragedy, nor once attempted to deſiſt, till the <hi>exeunt omnes</hi> of the laſt ſcene of the laſt act.</p>
               <p>The production, which at any other time might have entertained him, appeared to George now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly diſguſting; as, by its obtruſion, the mouths of the whole company were cloſed, till the ſalutation of "Good night" broke up the party.</p>

               <p>AFTER a week ſpent in London, during which time he had inſpected the accounts which his partners laid before him, Mr. Freeman returned to his ſeat in Yorkſhire, leaving his daughter Maria in Portland Place.</p>
               <p>The remainder of the winter was paſſed by the faſhionable family of the Emerys in a round of amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, of which the repetition would be tedious. The theatres, the opera, concerts, balls, routes and faro banks at length, however, yielded their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over the <hi>bea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> monde</hi> to the various attractions of ſummer.</p>
               <p>Away flew the Emery's to the Pavilion; which was a moſt beautiful Villa built by Mr. Emery, from a deſign of Wyat's, on the bank of the Thames, near Richmond.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="unknown:038596_0107_10129F3744062E90"/>
To this delightful ſpot George frequently rode on an evening, and returned to town in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; or ſometimes would remain there two or three days. The whole family delighted in his company; and though the Pavilion was never without a party of ſix or ſeven beſides themſelves, yet the additional ſociety of Mr. Barnwell was always matter of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But to none was his converſe ſo ſweet, his manners ſo pleaſing, as to the gentle Maria.</p>
               <p>Nor was her well cultivated mind, her well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded principles, her grace, her elegance of manners, and winning ſoftneſs of diſpoſition unnoticed by Barnwell. A mutual eſteem was the reſult. It may be properly called eſteem, for it was the homage of the judgment and the heart, unblended with paſſion: it was the delightful dawning of love; a ſerene, pleaſing ſenſation of the mind, unruffled by deſire.</p>
               <p>In their walks, they would ofttimes hear of each other's benevolence from the neighbouring cotta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>In their mixed companies, a ſmile of approbation from one, rewarded the expreſſions or ſentiments from the other. In the library their choice of authors was frequently the ſame; whilſt their private confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences ſtill more fully diſcovered their conformity of ſentiments and taſte.</p>
               <p>Dividing his time betwixt the Pavilion and Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Place, alternately enjoying the ſociety of his friend Lambton and the amiable Maria, with juſt enough of buſineſs to make his leiſure more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, George paſſed the months of this ſummer more pleaſantly than any former period of his life.</p>
               <p>The letters he received from his mother and Eliza, every week brought him the happieſt accounts of their health, and comfortable ſituation. The world appeared to his glad view a pleaſant garden; and bloſſoms of delight decorated his tranquil path.</p>
               <p>Such was Barnwell; when, towards the cloſe of day, about the middle of September, a perſon muf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled

up in a long black cloak, inquired for him in Portland Place; and upon being ſhewn into a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, diſcovered himſelf to be Mental. He was grown paler, and much thinner, than when George ſaw him laſt.</p>
               <p>"Are you alone?" cried he.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied George.</p>
               <p>"And are you at leiſure?—Does no banquet wait for you?"</p>
               <p>"None, I aſſure you," replied Barnwell, "Mr. Emery is at Buxton, and the reſt of the family at the Pavilion."</p>
               <p>"Is the door faſt?—Bolt it—I have a ſecret to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part."</p>
               <p>George began to ſurvey him more cloſely. His manners ſeemed even more wild, and his words more like madneſs, than when he parted with him. He obeyed him however, and repeated his aſſurances that they were alone.</p>
               <p>"When I laſt ſaw you, I gave you a miniature," ſaid Mental. "Have you it about you?"</p>
               <p>George drew it from his boſom.</p>
               <p>"Yet do not ſhew it me!—Confirmation is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary. Put it up—put it up!—O, horrible!"—and he ſhuddered as if ſeized with an ague.</p>
               <p>Barnwell was affected—"Whatnew ſorrow, Sir," ſaid he, "afflicts you thus?—May I be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted—?"</p>
               <p>"Sorrow!" cried Mental; give it not ſo ſoft a name! Fools, women, children, can be ſorry. If it rains, if the dews of heaven wet their ſilks, they are ſorry. If a dance is poſtponed, or a play deferred, or a dinner ſpoiled, folks are ſorry. What, then, but horror is it that a man muſt feel, who having murdered his wife, drives his child to perdition!—My Elinor!—my daughter!"</p>
               <p>"Have you heard any tidings of your daughter, Sir?" ſaid Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"Look at that miniature," ſaid Mental. "It is the counterpart of that which you poſſeſs."</p>
               <p>Walking three or four times up and down the
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:038596_0109_10129F3BAAF9E078"/>
room, which happened to be a dining parlour, and drinking a tumbler of water which ſtood on the ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, he appeared, after awhile, more compoſed, and threw himſelf into a chair.</p>
               <p>"It was my intention when you you came to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide here, of which I was appriſed, to have viſited you, but a ſtrange diſcovery prevented me. Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, one day, through the ſtreets of the metropolis, my eye was attracted by a brilliant ſhow of jewellery and trinckets in the window of a pawnbroker. Among a crowd of other articles, in one corner of the window, were three miniatures, one of which (imagine my ſurpriſe) ſtruck me as greatly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling what I had once ſeen. Upon a cloſer exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, not a doubt remained of its being the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpart of that which I preſented you at the abbey. The villain Linmore, in our happy days, painted the two likeneſſes. One was my poor Elinor's, which I gave you; the other was given to the governeſs of my daughter, to be preſented to her, and I know was preſented to her, on her twelfth birthday.</p>
               <p>"To ſee this miniature, then, was to ſee my daughter, and brought to my mind the painful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of her uncertain fate. I purchaſed it; and then, with an earneſtneſs that ſurpriſed the pawnbroker, requeſted him to relate to me all he knew concerning it.</p>
               <p>"Barren was his intelligence, amounting mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the recollection, that it was pledged there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two years ago, by a woman who lived as a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to ſome ladies, at that time lodging nearly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, at a houſe that had ſince been pulled down.</p>
               <p>'The woman,' he continued, 'ſtill very often comes here; and you may, perhaps, learn ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further from her.'</p>
               <p>"Day after day, forgetful of every thing elſe, I waited on the pawnbroker, and, in about a week, was informed the woman had been there, and had left her direction. I ſought her reſidence—a miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable one it was—the abode of infamy and lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:038596_0110_10129F3D404CE780"/>
O, how my heart ſickened at the picture of miſery and vice, wretchedneſs and debauchery!—and how fearfully I gazed at each countenance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dreading to behold among the hirelings of proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, my poor, abandoned child!</p>
               <p>"The woman who had pledged the miniature told a plain tale frankly, that made the blood freeze in my veins! The ladies with whom ſhe reſided, ſhe owned, were of that deſcription I feared—that the miniature, ſhe believed, belonged to the one who went by the name of Ellen, who had been well brought up, and had eloped very young, from a board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſchool, with an Iriſh officer.</p>
               <p>"I doubted no longer. Ellen, I perſuaded my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, was an abridgment of her own name; and I determined not to reſt till I diſcovered her retreat, if living—her grave, if dead.</p>
               <p>"The clue I gathered was, that, ſoon after the miniature was parted with, theſe unfortunate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men quarrelled and ſeparated. Ellen went with a young nobleman to Bath, and the other Unfortunate went <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"To Bath, the next day, I travelled poſt; and, by inquiries, found that the poor wretch reſided there about ſix months, and then quitted that place for Briſtol, where ſhe opened a little ſhop with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of her infamy, the nobleman having quitted her. Here ſhe reſided nearly twelve months, when having met with impoſitions and loſſes, ſhe became invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in debt, and was compelled once one to ſeek refuge from her creditors in the crowd of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, and returned to a miſerable traſſick of ſhame! O, what a year of miſery have I ſince endured!</p>

                  </gap>, I have viſited, I have ſtrolled whole nights through the ſtreets of London, viewing each female with a dreadful curioſity; but all was in vain: 'till, about a fortnight ago, at the corner of Exeter Street, in the Strand, I met the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to whom I firſt applied. She knew me, and accoſted me—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:038596_0111_10129F4155EB7EF8"/>
'Ah! Sir,' cried ſhe, 'poor Ellen!'—</p>
               <p>"I ſeized her by the arm—What of Ellen?—Where is ſhe?—anſwer me!—ſhew me where ſhe is!—exclaimed I.</p>
               <p>'Haven't you ſeen her, then, Sir?—Poor thing, ſhe wou'dn't know you now, then—She's quite <hi>delirous!'</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Take me to her this moment! ſaid I. I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her ſilently through ſeveral lanes and allies at the back of the Strand; till at length ſhe ſtopped at a dirty old houſe, kept by a woman who ſold green grocery. Feeling my way up two pair of dark ſtairs, I entered a miſerable apartment. The walls had once been white-waſhed, but were now covered with ſmoak and dirt. A dull light was admitted through a ſmall caſement darkened by pieces of old rags ſtuffed in ſeveral places where the glaſs was broken. Not a chair, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>able, was in the room; no grate, nor ſtove, was in the fire-place; but a few bits of wood were burning in one corner, over which an old woman, covered with rags and filth, was warming ſomething in a pipkin.</p>
               <p>"On the floor—On the <hi>floor!</hi> Mr. Barnwell," repeated Mental, "was a ſight to agoniſe a heart of ſtone! A thin mattreſs only was betwixt the bare boards and a poor emaciated wretch, breathing out the laſt ſigh of anguiſh and deſpair!</p>
               <p>'There's poor Ellen, Sir,' ſaid the woman who conducted me. And then addreſſing herſelf to the old woman—'Here, Mother Andrews,' ſaid ſhe, 'is a good gentleman come to ſee poor Ellen!' 'God bleſs him for it,' ſaid the old woman: 'but I'm <hi>afear'd</hi> its all over. I've been warming her a little tea—its all I've got to give her.'</p>
               <p>"All this paſſed during my profound ſilence, for I <hi>could</hi> not ſpeak. I knelt by the poor dying object; I took her ſenſeleſs hand, but in vain ſearched for the reſemblance of my Elinor. The agonies of death had already deformed the countenance; and in a few moments, with a groan, ſhe expired! I dropped

               <p>'God receive her poor ſoul!' ſaid the old wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>
               <p>"This arouſed me. 'Ill fated child! of an ill fated mother!' cried I, and embraced the ſenſeleſs corpſe. 'O, what a change from the blooming cherub of innocence, that I abandoned!' I ſunk in agony upon the body. At length the voice of the old woman again arouſed me—'Is there a Deity!—is there a Deity!' exclaimed I; 'and is this his world—and are we his creatures?—O, no, no, or theſe things would not be!' It was an ejaculation extorted by the keeneſt anguiſh, that ever pierced the human breaſt. The poor wretch gazed at me with a ſort of horror—</p>
               <p>'Ah! Sir,' cried ſhe; 'don't talk ſo!—There is a God who knows what's beſt for us all; and if we ſuffer in this world, he can reward us in another!—and I am ſure, poor ſoul, ſhe went through enough to atone for her folly. Poor creature!—nobody knows, but them that <hi>ſees,</hi> what they go through!'</p>
               <p>"And who art thou, that haſt ſeen ſo much?" ſaid I. 'Come—ſit you down;—[there was a waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tub and an old box, which ſerved for chair and table]—and, if you <hi>can,</hi> relate me the ſtory of this poor wretch!'</p>
               <p>'I only <hi>know'd</hi> her lately. In their beſt days they keep higher company. I have lived ten years in this room; and, though Ellen is the firſt that died here, I have 'tended many a one in ſickneſs on that bed. But then, if they get worſe, they moſtly <hi>got</hi> into ſome hoſpital, or went to their pariſh.'</p>
               <p>"And were there no hoſpital, or pariſh, for her?</p>
               <p>'Why, you ſhall hear. Its about two-months ago, ſince, one very rainy night, this poor creature was brought here by one, that had formerly had half of my bed. She was that day thruſt out of doors by a hard-hearted creature, who thought her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:038596_0113_10129F470ABF6F30"/>
an angel, truly, becauſe ſhe did not ſend the poor ſoul to jail, for about two and forty ſhillings, that ſhe owed her.</p>
               <p>'She was as thin as a lath! and had a cough; it made one's heart ache to hear it. The clothes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her back, and two ſhillings and a pocket-piece were all ſhe had in the world. The girl that brought her was a tender hearted thing, and promiſed that, if I would let her have half of my bed, ſhe would ſee me paid my groat a week regularly; and for a while ſure enough ſhe did, and brought her poor friend, now and then a raſpberry tart, and a little wine. But all of a ſudden ſhe left it off, and I have never ſeen her ſince. God knows but ſhe may now be in want herſelf.'</p>
               <p>"This is Society! cried I, ſhaking as with an ague. 'Anan?' ſaid the old woman, not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding me. She went on.</p>
               <p>'So, then, I was obliged to break into her two ſhillings; one went all at once for a bottle of ſtuff for her cough; and ſoon the other was ſpent alſo. Then the poor clothes went; one thing after another. And at laſt ſhe grew quite <hi>delirous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'I had ſaved up about a crown, but that I know'd wou'dn't laſt long; and as I could do no waſhing for the other girls, while I tended her, there was nothing coming in; and ſo I was obliged to apply for an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for her to be moved to the workhouſe, where ſhe was to have gone this morning; but laſt night ſhe changed ſo for the worſe, I thought it cruel to move her; and as ſhe wanted nothing but a little moiſture in her mouth, I ſaid I'd 'tend her till ſhe was releaſed, and then they might ſend for a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"No—No—cried I—I will provide what's want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>She was decently interred. The good Mrs. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews was rewarded. Good, I call her, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in her youth ſhe may have been, ſhe now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes

a heart that wills all good imaginable to her fellow creatures.</p>
               <p>"Thus far I had acted upon the preſumption of her being my child. There was little doubt upon the point, indeed; but ſtill it was not certain: when a circumſtance took place that confirmed me in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rather than believing. I applied to the woman who ſo inhumanly thruſt her from her houſe, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; but ſhe could afford me none. There was a trunk of her's, ſhe ſaid, in her poſſeſſion, which, upon paying what was owing, I might receive. She believed it was full of letters.</p>
               <p>"I eagerly conſented; and, upon opening the trunk, found it, as ſhe ſaid, full of letters. Among them was a bundle written in a neat female hand. I untied this bundle, and found the letters ſigned "Elinor." They are compoſitions of uncommon merit, as to ſtile and manner; but the matter, though ingenious, is highly exceptionable.</p>
               <p>"This circumſtance ſtaggered me extremely. That the letters were wrote by my daughter, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond a doubt. They had been ſent under cover, and began "Dear Friend;" but no addreſs was upon them.</p>
               <p>"The only conjecture, then, that can reconcile the deceaſed's having theſe letters, written by her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in her poſſeſſion, is, that they have been returned from the perſon to whom they were written."</p>
               <p>"It <hi>may</hi> be ſo," ſaid George; "but ſurely it is not too much to hope, that the deceaſed, after all, was the friend who reſided with your daughter; and that ſhe herſelf may yet be living."</p>
               <p>"Not for the wealth of worlds would I change the certainty of her death for ſuch a torturing ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. No—no—no—I will cheriſh the thought of having laid her in the ſilent grave, though it be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
               <p>"Come with me—Come with me—I'll ſhew you the ſpot where ſhe lies. I'll repeat to you the ſtory of her ſufferings; for, O, young man, in ſuch a houſe

as this, theſe leſſons are not common. The riot, the mirth, the glitter of guilt alone, you behold here. Come—come to the abodes of the dying, and the graves of the dead, and learn its certain conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces!" They walked out together.</p>

               <p>Curioſity and compaſſion were awakened by this letter in the breaſt of Barnwell. Repeatedly, and diſtinctly, he read its contents. There was diſtreſs, yet delicacy—there was an appeal to his heart through the moſt fine-wrought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This incident occupied his entire thoughts: he formed a variety of conjectures, planned his conduct according to the ſuppoſed caſes, and as ſpeedily renounced his imaginations as abſurd.</p>
               <p>That the purport of this viſit was to afford him an opportunity of diſplaying his generoſity, ſeemed certain; and he began a calculation of his finances. His uncle had remitted him large ſums. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, though great, were well managed.

               <p>Such were the reflections of inexperience, and ſuch the feelings of a benevolent and uncorrupted heart.</p>
               <p>He wrote an anſwer, appointing the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at twelve o'clock, for the interview; and felt no inconſiderable anxiety till its arrival.</p>

in deep mourning, with a work baſket in her hand. She ſeemed almoſt ſinking with diſſidence; and the ſtruggles of her wounded pride appeared depicted in her countenance. George roſe, and bowed reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectfully.</p>
               <p>"This condeſcenſion, Sir," ſaid ſhe, heſitating;—"the condeſcenſion of this viſit, is, at the ſame time, the ſource of ſo much ſatisfaction and pain!—that I muſt requeſt your pardon:—but—I really—I!—." And ſhe ſunk into her chair, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied her handkerchief to her face.</p>
               <p>Barnwell ſtood mute with ſurpriſe. Inſtead of the female of his imagination, worn with woe, and waſted with deſpair—a form and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ace had burſt upon his view, the moſt beautiful he had ever ſeen. Her figure, conſiderably above the middle ſize, was majeſtic, dignified, and elegant: her countenance admirably correſponded with her perſon. Dark hair, flowing in luxuriant ringlets on her forehead, and hanging looſe on her neck, greatly heightened the effect of a moſt delicate complexion, ſtill fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aſſiſted by well formed eye brows, and lips of coral hue.</p>
               <p>Her dreſs was ſimply elegant, and diſplayed the beauteous ſymmetry of her perſon to advantage. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a pauſe of ſome duration—</p>
               <p>"Pray, be ſeated, Sir," ſaid ſhe, recovering her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;—for Barnwell, unconſcious that he did ſo, had ſtood ſilently gazing on the form before him—"How weak are our ſtrongeſt reſolves!" continued ſhe. "I had, I imagined, prepared myſelf for this interview; and thought myſelf ſtrongly armed againſt all the attacks of pride: but the remembrance of what they <hi>have</hi> been, is among the laſt things with which the unfortunate are compelled to part."</p>
               <p>George, extremely afflicted at her diſtreſs, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once or twice to ſpeak himſelf, but failed in the attempt. The lady continued—</p>
               <p>"Many and powerful, were the ſtruggles I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered, ere I reſolved upon ſoliciting this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view; but the character of Mr. Barnwell, ſo op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:038596_0118_10129F55FAE23418"/>
to the volatile and unthinking youths of faſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion (to whom a ſtory of diſtreſs is the ſource either of ſpleen or ſcorn) added to the very encouraging traits of benevolent ſympathy ſo ſtrongly portrayed in his countenance, at length emboldened me to take a ſtep, I have ſince, more than once, repented. I have therefore, Sir, to entreat your pardon for ſo great a liberty; and hope you will completely eraſe from your memory the indiſcreet requeſt I have made."</p>
               <p>"Madam—I—If I can—if it is in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er—I ſhall be happy, Madam—I hope—if there is any thing that—."</p>
               <p>Such were the incoherent words of Barnwell, in whoſe breaſt pity, which was its conſtant gueſt, now mingled its influence with a new and ſtrange ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;—ſo ſtrange, ſo new, as to create a wild alarm not only in his countenance, but in his words and manners.</p>
               <p>"I perceive your generous intentions; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not—I <hi>ought</hi> not—to take advantage of ſo much good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!—How ſtrongly you reſemble your worthy father!"</p>
               <p>"You know my father?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir, I knew him once—They were happy days when I knew Mr. Barnwell!—I little dreamt how ſevere a deſtiny was to ſucceed thoſe joyful days. But, alas, how feeble is our hold on earthly bliſs—how fleeting our joy—how unſtable our hopes of happineſs!—O, painful to contemplate the picture of what I have been—and view the gloomy ſcenes before me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wealth, and friends, and hope, were then all mine. Now poverty, and enemies, and fell deſpair, ſurround me; and the worſt that Fate can ordain to mortals, is my gloomy expectation!"</p>
               <p>Barnwell had ſtruggled to overcome his embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment; and collecting himſelf as much as poſſible, he ſaid—</p>
               <p>"If the calamity, which has wrought ſo unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py a change, may be communicated without pain, believe me, Madam, the confidence with which you
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:038596_0119_10129F5A4B79CA38"/>
honour me ſhall be reſpected, by one who has ever felt for the unhappy, but who never felt ſo deeply as at the preſent moment."</p>
               <p>"Ah, Sir!" ſaid Milwood—and ſighed—"The ſoothing voice of friendſhip," continued ſhe, "has been ſo long unheard; my ear has been ſo uſed of late to the ſounds of anger and defiance, that the tenderneſs of your expreſſions has the influence of muſic on my mind. But when you are acquainted with my ſtory, I much fear that your language will be altered; and that, ceaſing to pity my misfortunes, you will only cenſure my miſconduct."</p>
               <p>"Pardon me, Madam," ſaid Barnwell. "The emotions of pity are arbitrary ſenſations, for the juſtice of which we cannot be preſumed reſponſible; but the voice of cenſure ought at leaſt to have the ſanction of experience, and the motives of preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To add poignancy of reproof to the ſtings of conviction, betrays an unfeeling heart at all times; but moſt unpardonable, indeed, would it be to pour reproach into the breaſt that ſeeks, by confidence, the balm of conſolation!"</p>
               <p>"Ceaſe, Sir! I beſeech you, ceaſe to ſpeak thus! You are not aware how much you increaſe the wound you ſeek to heal!"</p>
               <p>Then riſing from her chair, and walking with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable emotion about the room—</p>
               <p>"I have borne oppreſſion!" continued ſhe; "I have ſuffered, with ſome degree of dignity, the <hi>'ſtings and arrows of outrageous fortune;'</hi> but <hi>your</hi> pity, <hi>your</hi> ſympathy, Mr. Barnwell, diſarms me of my pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and increaſes the weakneſs I had almoſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued. I will haſten to relate to you my errors, that your ſcorn and contempt may ſubdue the baneful effects of your <hi>too cruel tenderneſs!"</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Myſterious!" exclaimed Barnwell, in a low tone of voice.</p>
               <p>"Hear me, Sir.—My name is Milwood: my family is one of the moſt ancient and reſpectable in the county where they reſide. My parents both died ere I had attained an age to be ſenſible of their
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:038596_0120_10129F5D1C3490D8"/>
loſs. I was the youngeſt of ſix orphans. My eldeſt brother who ſucceeded to the title and eſtates of his father, was at the period of his deceaſe, a ſtudent at Cambridge univerſity; another brother was an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in the militia of the county; and a third ſerved as a midſhipman in the navy.</p>
               <p>"I had two ſiſters, who, with myſelf, were taken under the guardianſhip of my mother's brother, the Dean of—. With this gentleman we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, enjoyed every advantage which his fortune or abilities could beſtow. As my father died inteſtate, and the whole of his property was in landed eſtates, every branch of the family was left dependent on the diſcretion and generoſity of my elder brother.</p>
               <p>"Poor Edward! Thy memory ſhall never be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted by me, however ſeverely the conſequences of the errors fall on thy unhappy ſiſter: Suffice it, then, to obſerve, that the indiſcretions of the youth at col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege were made the means of enriching a few worth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs characters, who preyed upon the openneſs of his ſoul, and conſigned to poverty and dependence thoſe, who were born with far better expectations.</p>
               <p>"The remorſe he felt, that a fate ſo unworthy of his houſe ſhould be brought upon it by himſelf, drove the ill-fated Edward to thoſe wretched expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, which, lulling for a moment the pangs of recollection, increaſe the dread of thought, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thoſe who ſeek them to a grave of ſhame.</p>
               <p>"So 'twas with my poor Edward! Peace to his ſpirit! My other brothers are each riſing to wealth and eminence in their profeſſions. The eldeſt of my ſiſters married to the ſatisfaction of the Dean, and is now the happy mother of ſeveral children. My other ſiſter died.</p>
               <p>"Now, Sir, I am to ſpeak of myſelf. From a long reſidence in his family, from his parental fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I had imbibed for the Dean, my uncle, all the tender feelings of a daughter. The Deanery was as my native home; and every deſire that the young heart knows, was gratified as ſoon as known. 'Twas
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:038596_0121_10129F5EAE2FFD68"/>
here I once was honored with the ſociety of your father. He was an excellent man." [George bowed.] "I have no particular event to detail," continued Milwood, "till, about two years ago, when a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant relation of the Dean's who had been ſome time upon a viſit at the Deanery, did me the honor to offer me propoſals of marriage. It was not the firſt offer I had received; but it was the firſt that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the preſſing recommendation of the Dean.</p>
               <p>"I anſwered, however, to this propoſal, as I had uniformly done to others; and candidly intimated, that I did not feel that affection, on which alone I built my hopes of happineſs in the married ſtate; and without which, it was my firm determination never to approach the altar!</p>
               <p>"Why, then did he ſtill purſue me? Why did he commence a perſecution, that can only terminate with my exiſtence! Or why O, my beloved uncle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> why did the cold calculations of intereſt outweigh, in thy breaſt, the pleadings of nature!</p>
               <p>"I muſt check myſelf.—The wealth and honors of the gentleman who was my ſuitor were among his inferior recommendations. Elegant in his perſon and manners; happy and uniform in his temper; mild and benevolent in his diſpoſition; learned without pedantry; witty, without ſatire; he poſſeſſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every qualification that could render him amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eſtimable. Yet, Sir, I felt for Lord Nareſby nothing like love. I admired his accompliſhments; I reſpected his virtues; but, alas! this ſtate of mind is far ſhort of love. You, perhaps, Mr. Barnwell, as well as myſelf, are, I preſume, ſenſible how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent the operations of our hearts are from the cool exerciſes of our underſtandings!"</p>
               <p>The abruptneſs of this appeal, and the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting look that accompanied it, overwhelmed with confuſion the youth to whom it was addreſſed. Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well bluſhed deeply; he ſtammered; but his words were incoherent ſounds.</p>
               <p>Of love, as a paſſion, he had hitherto known no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:038596_0122_10129F6045E31480"/>
but the name. There was, perhaps, ſomething extremely like the beginnings of love now ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling for exiſtence in his boſom; but it was a new, a ſtrange ſenſation, of whoſe origin he was ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant; of whoſe influence he had no conception.</p>
               <p>Milwood, whoſe penetration and art equalled her beauties, obſerved with ſatisfaction, with delight, the diſorder of which ſhe well knew herſelf the creator. Diſſembling, however the joy ſhe felt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the well feigned ſemblance of ſorrow, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her tale.</p>
               <p>"My uncle," ſaid ſhe, "ſo warmly eſpouſed the cauſe of Lord Nareſby, as to deſcend to threats of his diſpleaſure, if I perſiſted in refuſing his propoſals. He is naturally a humane man; but, in this inſtance, his anger overcame him, and his expreſſions were harſh and cruel. Still, Sir, I perſiſted in my refuſal.</p>
               <p>My brothers, were appealed to. My married ſiſter, and her lord, were alſo made my judges; and with one voice they all condemned me to the cruel alternative of marrying a man, for whom I felt no preference; or of forfeiting, for ever, their protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſteem!</p>
               <p>"The moſt inſulting and unfeeling motives were attributed to me in rejecting ſo ſplendid and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ourable a propoſal. I was ſhunned by the whole family. My walks were at firſt watched; at laſt, prohibited. I was detained a priſoner in my uncle's caſtle, nor ever permitted to walk beyond the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daries of his Park.</p>
               <p>"As my relations increaſed their cruelty towards me, Lord Nareſby redoubled his tenderneſs and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; obtaining by his intereſt occaſional liberties, and ſome few marks of concern from my tyrants; but, inſtead of gaining, by this conduct, any advance in my eſteem, it ſunk him beneath the former level of indifference, and I became diſguſted with a man, who would conſent to receive ſuch mean advantages.</p>
               <p>"My ſituation grew daily more and more into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable. A faithful ſervant, who had attended me
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:038596_0123_10129F61E2899168"/>
for many years, was diſcharged, upon the pretended ſuſpicion of aiding me in an ideal correſpondence, which they ſaid I carried on with ſome low born wretch, whom I had the meanneſs to prefer to the man of their choice.</p>
               <p>"Alas! how much were they miſtaken, if, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they imagined my heart at that time had a preference among mankind. No, Sir, not even a friend, beyond poor Mary, whom they diſcharged, had I in the whole world. When ſhe was gone, they placed over me a cruel, inſolent old woman, in the capacity of a ſervant, but with the powers of a miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>"Debarred the comforts of ſociety, of reading, drawing, or any other amuſement, my mind, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken in its reſolution, became deſperate; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter duly weighing all the obſtacles that oppoſed themſelves to ſuch a ſtep, I determined to quit, for ever, the houſe that had hitherto been my aſylum.</p>
               <p>"My faithful Mary found means to acquaint me, in my captivity, that, after her diſmiſſal, ſhe had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled, at her own expence, twenty eight miles from the caſtle to an old lady who was my father's diſtant relation, but an inveterate foe to my uncle, and all my mother's relations.</p>
               <p>"This lady, a widow, and childleſs, was extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rich; and though ſhe had never ſeen me, ſuch was the ſucceſs of Mary's tale of my ſufferings, that ſhe commiſſioned her to tell me, ſhe would receive me as her daughter, if I could eſcape from the caſtle.</p>
               <p>I did eſcape; and Mary and I were received by my relation with every mark of kindneſs and reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
               <p>"I have particular reaſons for concealing, for the preſent, the name of this lady and her reſidence.</p>
               <p>My uncle ſoon diſcovered my retreat, and wrote a letter filled with indignation at my conduct, and a formal renunciation; in which he was joined by my brothers and ſiſters.</p>
               <p>"In my new ſituation I was, for ſome time, as
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:038596_0124_10129F69C3AE4A90"/>
happy as I could wiſh; till an event—But let me ſtop in time—If I proceed with ſincerity to relate the cauſe of my unhappineſs, I am afraid—indeed, Mr. Barnwell—I am much afraid, the loſs of your eſteem would be the painful conſequence; and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven only knows how highly I eſteem your good opinion.</p>
               <p>"Madam!"—exclaimed Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"Aye, Sir, you may well be ſurpriſed!—My face, my voice, are new to you; but not ſo your's to me."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" ſaid Barnwell. "Where, pray, have you then ſeen it?"</p>
               <p>"No matter, Sir—ſince I now ſee it for the last time!"</p>
               <p>"I hope not!" ſaid Barnwell, with warmth. "Stranger as you are to me, Madam, I feel ſo deeply intereſted, ſo much concerned, for your welfare, that, excepting my ſiſter and my mother, I know no perſon in the world I more ardently deſire to ſerve."</p>
               <p>"You are kind—you are very kind!" ſaid Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Can</hi> I ſerve you, Madam?"</p>
               <p>"You <hi>alone, can</hi> ſerve me; but you <hi>will not,</hi> nay, you <hi>ſhall not</hi> ſerve me."</p>
               <p>"You ſpeak myſteriouſly, and look wild. Fear not, I beſeech you, to confide to me your ſorrows!—my boſom ſhall be their ſacred repoſitory."</p>
               <p>"Generous—generous youth!" ſaid Milwood; and, with a ſeeming unconſciouſneſs, threw her arm upon his ſhoulder: then, appearing to recollect her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, haſtily withdrew it.</p>
               <p>Every moment now increaſed the deſire of George to be made acquainted with her diſtreſs. He gazed earneſtly upon her face, endeavouring to read her ſorrows in her countenance. He ventured to take her hand—</p>
               <p>"Dear lady, let me intreat you no longer to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay the recital of your woes. Of whatever nature they may prove, God only grant me the power to remove them, and I ſhall be the happieſt of all men."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="unknown:038596_0125_10122B28653D4788"/>
"Your generoſity of mind, your tenderneſs of heart, are indeed the objects of my admiration! But, alas; my calamity is of ſo peculiar a nature, that the moſt generous mind, the moſt ſuſceptible heart, cannot conceive any thing that can alleviate it. Mine is a ſilent ſorrow, that broods within my own breaſt. A ſigh is its only expreſſion—a tear is its only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief:—no tongue has proclaimed it: no ear has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived its complaint. To you it deſires to ſpeak—to you <hi>alone</hi> it <hi>will ever</hi> ſpeak; but—ſpare me—pardon me—leave me!"—And ſhe wept.</p>
               <p>How ſtrange is her behaviour, thought Barnwell:—how wild, yet how mournful her countenance! After a pauſe, Milwood, recovered her former ſeren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and continued—</p>
               <p>"I am to blame, Sir, thus to trifle with your time. I will endeavour to conclude my dull narrative, and at all hazards venture to explain the motive of my requeſt to ſee you.</p>
               <p>"My benefactreſs, whoſe bounty was my only reſource, continued to treat me with the affectionate regard of a parent; my days rolled on in comfort; and my heart knew no diſtreſs, till that event to which I before alluded. O, God! how ſhall I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it!—But it muſt be told.</p>
               <p>"There reſided near our dwelling a family of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectability, but not wealthy; they therefore did not viſit our houſe, but we once or twice met in the neighbourhood. Of the father—of the mother—of the daughter, I ſhall ſay nothing; but of the ſon!—Pardon me—Indeed, I cannot proceed!"</p>
               <p>"Wave this reluctance," cried Barnwell. "Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in me, as your brother:—you ſhall find me as tender of your feelings, as zealous in your ſervice, as if one womb had borne us."</p>
               <p>"What do I hear!" cried Milwood, with quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. "Is it poſſible! Did you ſay, you loved me as a brother!—Happy, happy moment!" She took his hand, and kiſſing it with warmth, exclaimed—"My brother—my brother!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:038596_0126_10129F6B54E0E4F8"/>
Barnwell ſtarting from his chair, and ſnatching away his hand, ſeemed thrown into a delirium; whilſt Milwood, appearing to recollect herſelf, hung down her head, and bluſhed.</p>
               <p>"In the name of heaven, Madam, tell me, who and what you are? Finiſh, I beſeech you, this myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious tale, and quickly, that I may, if poſſible, ſerve you; or if not, may inſtantly eſcape a preſence that creates emotions of pain and pleaſure, too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful to be long endured!"</p>
               <p>"I entreat your forgiveneſs," cried Milwood. "But go, Sir—go—ere you know the miſery <hi>you</hi> have occaſioned—the ſtorm of ruin that <hi>you</hi> have raiſed—Go ignorant of my wretchedneſs, which to know, would perhaps excite a painful pity in your breaſt, but no relief to me!—Since to behold me is ſo painful—"</p>
               <p>"I did not ſay ſo!" cried Barnwell "or if I did—"</p>
               <p>"I ſee," ſaid Milwood, "we are both too much agitated. Your ſurpriſe, and perhaps your pity, have overpowered you; whilſt I—I am the prey of feelings which rack my boſom with torture inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſible!"</p>
               <p>"'Tis ſuſpenſe alone that tortures me," cried Barnwell. "Your manner—your myſterious words—and the wildneſs of your eyes, make me dread a ſomething, which I fear—yet aſk—to know!—You ſpeak of a youth who reſided near you—You talk of ruin, of miſery, of which I am the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor—You requeſt to ſee me—You deſire me to leave you, as ignorant as I came!—Whence ſpring ſuch inconſiſtencies?"</p>
               <p>"From a ſource <hi>you</hi> have never dreamt of," ſaid Milwood, with firmneſs;—"from Love!"—</p>
               <p>Her countenance was now altered from the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of contending influence, to a portrait of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination! Her eyes were fixed firmly on Barnwell:—ſhe remained ſilently gazing on his face a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time. Barnwell himſelf was dumb.</p>
               <p>"'Tis over!" at length cried Milwood: "I have
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:038596_0127_10129F6D370D75C8"/>
conquered!—The youth to whom I alluded, is—George Barnwell!—Yes!—he it is, whom Fate has ordained my deſtruction! For him, I quit my friends, my country—For him, I forfeit affluence, and embrace the horrors of poverty, in a foreign and diſtant clime!—Was it, then, too much to aſk the favour of one hour's interview, merely to declare how ardently I love, and how largely I ſacrifice to an hopeleſs paſſion!</p>
               <p>"O Nature!—can I thank thee for the liberal ſhare of perſonal attractions thy hand has given me, ſince they have but ſerved to heap upon my head the perſecutions of a train that I cannot help deſpiſing, while on that heart alone, which I eſteem, their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is too weak to impreſs even a cold regard!"</p>
               <p>Barnwell was loſt in wonder! after various at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts—"I do not remember ever to have ſeen you before!" ſaid he.</p>
               <p>"I can too eaſily believe you, Sir."</p>
               <p>"And yet, I think, if ever I had beheld ſuch a countenance as your's, ſurely, Madam, I could not have forgotten its intereſting traits!"</p>
               <p>"Nay, Sir," cried Milwood, I muſt not hear you, if your voice aſſumes that ſtrain. Do not imagine Sir, my declaration meant to claim your pity! No,—my reſolution is fixed as firmly as the decrees of Fate. One moment longer let me detain your ear and then, farewell for ever!—Briefly, then—the ſame perſecutions, though from different quarters, rendered the abode of my benefactreſs as miſerable as my uncle's, with this addition of wretchedneſs—that in the latter, my heart was wholly diſengaged; in the former, your image, your worth, barred all avenues to affection for another.</p>
               <p>"The object ſo dear to me was unknown to my benefactreſs—to all the world—but myſelf. My refuſals were therefore deemed obſtinacy; my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance became rebellion; and I was at length driven to the dreadful alternative of quitting, for ever, the refuge I had obtained, or to approach the ſolemn altar, and vow fidelity with my lips, whilſt my heart would be adulterous for ever.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="unknown:038596_0128_10129F6ED05AB0F8"/>
"Such was the choice held out for my adoption: and could I heſitate? No, not for a moment! I waited not to be driven from a home—Voluntarily I departed.—I have remained ſome time in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis—I determined to ſee you;—and now will for ever quit the country that gave birth to my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence and my woes!—I will ſeek in ſome corner of a diſtant land, that grave, which can alone reſtore peace to my heart, by an oblivion of you!"</p>
               <p>She ceaſed. Barnwell, who had riſen from his chair, and was walking about the room, was deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in thought, combatting one ſuggeſtion of his fancy after another, till his head became giddy.—He threw himſelf on a ſofa, and leaned his head on his arm. Milwood with the tendereſt expreſſions of concern, took his hand, and preſſed it warmly.</p>
               <p>"If I have given <hi>you</hi> pain—if I have relieved my own breaſt, at the expence of a moment's uneaſineſs, to you—what a ſource of eternal regret! Or, if I have rendered myſelf odious, by a declaration which cuſtom condemns, and have erected a monument of ſcorn in that remembrance, where I ſought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite the pearl of pity—O, how miſerable has my folly made me! Say then, only, that you do not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe me—that you do not abhor me—and I will never—never—trouble your quiet more!"</p>
               <p>"His heart muſt be differently moulded from mine," ſaid George, "that can deſpiſe, or abhor you, Madam. Your confeſſion has ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on mine, I would ſay more—but, at preſent, let me, at leaſt, entreat you not to quit this place, till I have been favoured with another interview. I have a mother—I have—"</p>
               <p>"Hear me on my knees, Mr. Barnwell," inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Milwood; "if you do not wiſh to drive me to the moſt awful crime our nature can commit, grant me my requeſt:—ſilence, ſilence, eternal ſilence to my ſtory. There is not a calamity in life I ſhould ſo hardly bear, as the diſcovery of my imprudence! Then ſwear to me—nay, I will not quit this poſture

               <p>"Good God, what do you aſk!" cried Barnwell, "In the moſt trying ſituation of my life, would you deprive my inexperience of their ſuperior council, who love me, and have wiſdom to direct me?"</p>
               <p>"What council can you want—what is there to determine?" cried Milwood. "By to-morrow's ſetting ſun, I ſhall be the ocean's charge. All that you have heard will then be only as a viſion, that may occaſionally aſk a ſigh; whilſt it reminds you, that there is one in the univerſe, on whom the night will never ſteal, or the dawn break, without a pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to nature's Author for your heart's peace! Why, then, ſhould you wiſh to make her errors tales of common tattle, or give her conduct to the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beings, who have not her feelings?

               <p>"Riſe! I beſeech you, riſe!"</p>

               <p>"Will you, then, promiſe me," ſaid Barnwell, to remain here till to-morrow?"</p>
               <p>"By no means!"</p>
               <p>"Will you permit me an interview this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?"</p>
               <p>"For what purpoſe, Mr. Barnwell?"</p>
               <p>"Nay, I know not!" cried Barnwell; "but my heart tells me—that I am to blame. I would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the neceſſity of your leaving England."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"Neceſſity!"</hi> interrupted Milwood. "'Tis my choice!"</p>
               <p>"But if—if—" cried Barnwell; and his breath grew ſhort. "Why—why do you wiſh to reſtrain me from conſulting my friends? I have an important, very important, point to decide; and I dare not truſt my feelings with the deciſion."</p>
               <p>"I underſtand the inſult now!" cried Milwood,

riſing, ſcornfully. "You would inſinuate, that, if your relations can find no juſt objection to my cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and fortune, you might condeſcend to pity me, and <hi>perhaps, if,</hi> and <hi>ſuppoſing ſo</hi> and <hi>ſo,</hi> you would then offer <hi>me</hi> a love, not the offspring of my creation, but a condeſcending acceptance of overtures, you may imagine I have made to you!

               <p>After a pauſe—"I cannot ſee the neceſſity for this, Mr. Barnwell. Why ſhould we meet again? Why not immediately ſeparate for ever! But—" pauſing again—"ſince your requeſt is otherwiſe—be it ſo, Sir. I ſhall expect you in the evening; till then, farewell!"</p>

               <p>IN the moſt profound reverie Barnwell paſſed the diſtance betwixt Berners Street and Mr. Emerys'. The crowd that ſurrounded him, the buſtle of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, were inſufficient to arouſe him from a ſort of ſtupor into which he had fallen.</p>
               <p>When he arrived at home, he ruſhed through the
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:038596_0131_10129F78B9D6B788"/>
hall, and hurrying to his own room, threw himſelf into a chair—"Milwood!—Milwood!" mutter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he; 'I never heard the name; I have no recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the face before to-day.—O, what an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant day! Thoſe looks!—that form!—never will my memory loſe the impreſſion!"</p>
               <p>He ſighed deeply, and painfully.—"Love <hi>me!</hi>—Yes, ſhe loves me! She owns it: nay, her beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour declares it more powerfully than her words! What a wond'rous effect has ſhe wrought upon me! What means this ſwelling of the heart this quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the pulſe—this difficulty of reſpiration? Can I imbibe a partiality ſo inſtantaneouſly? Are our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, indeed, ſo ſuſceptible?—Surely, it cannot be! 'Tis pity for Milwood—for her ſufferings—that pains me thus. Then let me ſoften them as much as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible—let me ſend her in writing the oath ſhe requires, and ſpare her the pain of another interview! and yet—<hi>never</hi> to ſee her again!—Why do I feel a dread at that thought? Suppoſe ſhe ſhould be alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy gone? Forbid it heaven! Once more—once more, let me behold a form ſo lovely! What brilliant expreſſion in her eyes!—what ſenſe! what anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in her countenance!—How happily might I paſs my life with ſuch a woman! But then her ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation—my own too! Madneſs alone can ſuggeſt ſuch a thought. She is proud—I dare not offer her pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuniary aid. Where can ſhe go? What part of the globe does ſhe ſeek? Unhappy Milwood! Would I had never ſeen you!—Would to God I had never ſeen you!"</p>
               <p>Such were the meditations of Barnwell—Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood abſorbed all his thoughts, while her beauteous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>orm floated in air before his imagination! Never, till this day, had his imagination been heated by the charms of woman!</p>
               <p>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Maria Freeman he beheld an amiable compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, whoſe modeſty and beauty mingled won the eſteem of his heart, and the approbation of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; but in Milwood he ſaw a far different female.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="133" facs="unknown:038596_0132_10129F7B930F1EB0"/>
This woman was beautiful in the extreme. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had, indeed been liberal of her gifts, and educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had increaſed the value of her bounty. Milwood had once poſſeſſed every thing deſirable in the female character; for ſhe once poſſeſſed virtue and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence. But ſhe parted with innocence, and in its ſtead had admitted, as the gueſt of her heart, the moſt accompliſhed cunning.</p>
               <p>At an early period of her life ſhe had ſurrendered all claim to chaſtity, and had ſince then ſubmitted to that miſerable traffic, which is the moſt ſevere libel on civilized ſociety.</p>
               <p>Too aſpiring to herd with the unhappy claſs to which ſhe had reduced herſelf, her ſtrong and tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering mind was perpetually buſied upon ſchemes more valuable to herſelf, and far loftier in the ſcale of wickedneſs than the generality of thoſe unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate beings, whoſe daily infamy is their daily bread!</p>
               <p>In her own fall, ſhe was the dupe of a profeſſed rake; and her own ſchemes upon the tranquility of others were all infuſed with a large portion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge. Man at large ſhe deemed her enemy; and the talents, and the charms ſhe poſſeſſed, ſhe conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as the weapons of revenge.</p>
               <p>Unlike many a ſighing wretch, whom ſevere diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs urges to compunctive acts of ſhame, Milwood was ſyſtematically vicious. The preſent world bounded her views of futurity, and the ſtruggles of the preſent ſcene ended, in her imagination, the drama of exiſtence!</p>
               <p>Thus, no principles of a religious nature ſwayed her thoughts, no checks of conſcience ever intervened betwixt the inclination and the deed: Pity, and all the tender ſenſibilities which many natures feel, were her inward deriſion; but their ſemblance was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly at her command.</p>
               <p>Such was Milwood! Such was ſhe, for whom Barnwell, at firſt ſight, had unconſciouſly imbibed the moſt powerful love!</p>
               <p>She had never once ſeen his father, or any of his
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:038596_0133_10129F7E70AC4038"/>
relations; nor had ever beheld Barnwell himſelf, till his arrival at Mr. Emery's. Having learnt the very great confidence repoſed in him, the large ſums en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to his care, ſhe was not long in arranging a method to enſnare him within her power. For this purpoſe, ſhe had ſpared no pains to obtain the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence ſhe had gained concerning his family, and had feigned the ſtory ſhe had related to him, and which containad not one ſyllable of truth.</p>
               <p>Her ſentiments, her tone of voice, her geſtures, were ſtudied for the occaſion; and ſhe was guided, from moment to moment in the plan ſhe would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, by the effect which her penetration diſcovered ſhe had wrought on her victim.—Thus artfully had ſhe prepared the ground-work of her plot; and had thus far ſucceeded to the extent of her wiſhes.</p>
               <p>The interim, betwixt his departure and the hour at which ſhe expected his return, was anxiouſly ſpent by Milwood; and ſhe repented, more than once, that ſhe had ſuffered him to leave her: a ſtep to which ſhe had conſented, chiefly to carry on appearances, and from a perſuaſion, in which ſhe was not miſtaken, of her power over him.</p>
               <p>Meanwhile he, for whom her machinations were deviſed, was planning the means of rendering her happy. Many and various were the reſolutions he formed, but all unſtable. His heart had admitted a ſpark, which his reaſon was too impotent to extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh, and which was riſing rapidly into a flame, of whoſe influence he was ignorant, but whoſe warmth he began to diſcover.</p>
               <p>If the imagination of Barnwell was already wro't to a dangerous warmth, the next reception he met with in Berners Street was well calculated to increaſe it.</p>
               <p>On a crimſon damaſk ſofa, placed under a brilliant mirror, illuminated by wax lights, reclined the Syren Milwood.—A moſt elegant white dreſs had ſuperſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the ſable weeds of the morning; with a Turkiſh turban, ornamented with gold cords and taſſels. The
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:038596_0134_10129F814EC518F0"/>
ſolemn air of dignified ſorrow was exchanged for the moſt faſcinating ſmiles; and inſtead of the reſerved and baſhful demeanour, Barnwell had prepared him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to meet, he was thrown off his guard by the moſt alluring glances.</p>
               <p>She did not riſe when he entered the room, but holding out a moſt beautiful arm, encircled at the wriſt with a brilliant bracelet—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Barnwell!" ſaid ſhe, with an enchanting ſoftneſs.</p>
               <p>George approached in the moſt profound aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, and received her offered hand.</p>
               <p>"Am I not a ſtrange creature!" continued ſhe. "My trappings of woe, you ſee, are ſoon thrown off. But, in truth, I did not think it conſiſtent with the pleaſure I expected, in your ſociety, to wear the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of ſorrow!"</p>
               <p>George was petrified with amazement, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for a moment, whether the woman of ſentiment he had ſeen in the morning, and the wanton form now before him, were the ſame. As ſhe ſtill held his hand in her's, ſhe fixed her ſparkling eyes full on his face—</p>
               <p>"You have an uncommon countenance!" ſaid ſhe. "You are very ſevere—and yet have great ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility. You are a compound of the ſtern and the tender: I ſcarcely know which preponderates in your nature. You do not lack courage, or fortitude; at the ſame time you will weep at a tale of miſery, and the unfortunate are ſure of your ſympathy. Is it not ſo? I have ſtudied Lavater. Now, let me try if I am miſtaken. Place that harp nearer me, and I'll ſing you a ditty about a poor ſimple maid—'who never told her love, but let concealment,' as the poet ſays—and ſo on—Now be ſilent!"</p>
               <p>It is difficult to convey an idea of Barnwell's ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the preſent moment. The feelings with which he had entered the room were changed ſo ſuddenly, it ſeemed the work of inchantment. Pity for the ſorrows of Milwood was abſolutely forgotten in the bewildered admiration of her charms; and the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:038596_0135_10129F842668DAF0"/>
determination of his reaſon, as to the ſteps he ſhould purſue, was loſt in the delightful and intoxicating dream of the exiſting moment.</p>
               <p>He placed the harp—and Milwood, changing her features from the wanton to the languiſhing, gave him the manuſcript to hold, while ſhe ſung and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied a ſimply pleaſing ballad with exquiſite taſte and melody. The expreſſion of her eyes was perfectly in uniſon with the words; and her voice uttered the ſweeteſt ſounds!—It was a pathetic ſtory, and affected Barnwell extremely.</p>
               <p>"There," cried ſhe, "I knew you would weep—at a fiction too! And will not real ſufferings," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſhe, in a tender voice, "at leaſt as much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect you!—Ah! Mr Barnwell—to me only you are inſenſible! My abrupt ſincerity has made me the object of your ſcorn!—Yes, cruel and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible, you return the moſt glowing affection with the coldeſt diſdain!"</p>
               <p>"Diſdain!—O, no!" ſaid Barnwell:—"ſay, rather, admiration and eſteem! Where is the being, who could gaze on ſuch charms, and diſdain their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor? How muſt the heart be formed, that can remain inſenſible to ſo much beauty!"</p>
               <p>"There are hearts, I fear," ſaid Milwood, "round which the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>cy hand of worldly prudence forms a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that freezes every paſſion of the ſoul. There are beings, who can love according to a ſcale of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and model their affections by a ſtandard! But I do not—cannot—think ſo young a heart as your's—"</p>
               <p>"Our Reaſon," interrupted Barnwell, "ſhould regulate, not deſtroy our paſſions!"</p>
               <p>"Charming philoſophy!" cried Milwood, with a ſatirical ſmile. "And where did you learn that maxim? I ſhould ſuppoſe ſome ponderous folio ſo ſays. But have books hearts? No, no, Mr. Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. Aſk thoſe who wrote the ſenſeleſs lies, what is this Reaſon, that is ſo omnipotent? Where is it to be ſeen—or who poſſeſſes it?"</p>
               <p>"Aſtoniſhing!" ſaid Barnwell. "Do you, then deny the exiſtence of Reaſon?"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="137" facs="unknown:038596_0136_10129F88A4C8FA18"/>
"Yes, ſuch Reaſon as the black letter gentlemen depict. Can Reaſon quench the thirſt, or ſatiate the appetite of hunger?—Ah! no—no! And is the ſtrongeſt impulſe of our natures to be ſo eaſily ſwayed by Reaſon then? Why have we paſſions—merely to torment us! O, infamous libel on the Author of our exiſtence, who has given his creatures all things to enjoy.—Well ſings the poet—<hi>To enjoy is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>The air, the doctrine of Milwood now rouſed, for the firſt moment, a ſuſpicion in his mind of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, which ſtartled Barnwell. He ſunk into a profound reverie, his eyes caſt on the floor.—Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood obſerved it, and ſaw the ſtruggle that was ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in his breaſt. Perfect miſtreſs of her art, ſhe was aware how imperceptibly her bold advances had ſtolen into his heart, and with a cunning caution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained her efforts, and changed her operations.</p>
               <p>Inſtead of attempting to continue an argument, at which ſhe well knew he revolted, ſhe touched the ſtrings of the harp, and raiſed an inchantment of mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ody: from the ſloweſt and the ſofteſt, to the moſt briſk and lively meaſures, her fingers ſwept the trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling chords. The effect on Barnwell was inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous. In vain did the enamoured youth aim to repreſs the riſing flame—in vain attempted to reſiſt the maddening impulſe of deſire!—On the precipice of danger, he was ignorant of his ſituation. His cheeks fluſhed, his eyes looked wild, and he fell back on the ſofa, overcome with the force of ſuch new and powerful emotions.</p>
               <p>The ſyren ſaw her time. She ſtruck the harp again, and—

               <p>"NOT at home all night!" exclaimed Mental, in the hall at Mr. Emery's—"not at home all night!" repeated he.</p>
               <p>Whilſt he was ſpeaking, Barnwell knocked at the door. At the ſight of Mental he ſtarted back, and hung down his head. His hair was undreſſed, his eyes were read and ſwelled, and his whole appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance proclaimed the revelry in which the night had paſſed.</p>
               <p>Mental ſurveyed him leiſurely from head to foot; during which time Barnwell recovered from his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, and invited him into a parlour.</p>
               <p>"Having a few hours of leiſure this morning," ſaid Mental, throwing himſelf into a chair, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on an oaken ſtaff, "I came to have ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with you. I am ſorry that my viſit is ſo ill rimed.

               <p>"You are ſatirical," ſaid George, endeavouring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"You are hypocritical," replied Mental.—</p>

               <p>"He who attempts to put a ſimper on his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance whilſt his heart aches with remorſe, is a hypocrite!" ſaid Mental.</p>
               <p>Barnwell's cheek glowed with the bluſh of ſhame.</p>
               <p>"Young man," continued Mental, "accident has brought us acquainted with each other. I love you, ſincerely love you. I have wealth—I have no

               <p>"Spare me—ſpare!" cried Barnwell.—"I have fallen ſufficiently in my own eſteem—Let me not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit your's!"</p>

               <p>"Never—never," cried Barnwell, with warmth, "ſhall you have to upbraid me with ſo mean a vice!"</p>
               <p>"There is but one conjecture more, then," ſaid Mental, with peculiarly ſatirical expreſſion:—"but <hi>that</hi> would ſcarcely make you <hi>ſad!</hi> Beſides, at your age—in this hot-bed of the paſſions, London—I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume chaſtity has long been relinquiſhed, as a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue unſuited to the times in which you live;—an incumbrance, indeed, which young men of faſhion muſt not be ſuſpected of retaining.—Long ere laſt night, therefore—"</p>
               <p>"Forbear, I beſeech you, Sir!" ſaid Barnwell; "you ſtrike a painful chord!—'Till laſt night I had not to upbraid myſelf with a crime, beyond all others baſe—<hi>ſeduction!"</hi>—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="140" facs="unknown:038596_0139_10129F8EA0E83990"/>
"Hold—hold—hold!—if you would not have me curſe you!" cried Mental.—"Do you not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member," continued he, claſping his hands together, "that I once poſſeſſed an angel, till Seduction tore her from my arms!—that I had once a daughter!—that I abandoned her; and that <hi>ſhe,</hi> too, was ſeduced!—driven to infamy!—to death! And can you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs yourſelf a Seducer! O, how often have I invok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eternal vengeance on the deliberate betrayer of confiding innocence!—Recal the odious charge, or you will become more loathſome to my ſight than leproſy. But it is impoſſible! You a Seducer! It cannot be. The deliberate Seducer muſt be a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing—allied to natures differing from human. His heart muſt be a ſalamander's bed; his head the cool repoſitory of deſign and artifice. The paſſions that rob other men of prudence, increaſe his cunning, and render him the agent of the deepeſt villainy! Such you cannot be!—But you are agitated—I ſpeak too warmly—My feelings muſt excuſe for me."</p>
               <p>Changing his voice and manner into the ſofteſt and moſt gentle, he ceaſed not his importunities till he had obtained from Barnwell a relation of all that had paſſed betwixt himſelf and Milwood.</p>
               <p>When he had heard the whole narrative—"'Tis a ſtrange tale!" cried he: "a very ſtrange ſtory! But as you relate it, you charge yourſelf with too large a ſhare of blame. I have ſtrong doubts of this Milwood."</p>
               <p>"O, Sir, you have not ſeen her—or her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance would prevent ſuch undeſerved ſuſpicion."</p>
               <p>"You have promiſed to ſee her again, of courſe," ſaid Mental.</p>
               <p>"See her again!" echoed Barnwell:—"what tortures would be ſevere enou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>"Do you mean to marry her, then?" ſaid Mental.</p>
               <p>Barnwell ſtarted at the queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="unknown:038596_0140_10129F943B041FB0"/>
"Your uncle Sir James, your mother, your ſiſter, perhaps will ſcruple to receive into their family a relation of ſo myſterious a character!"</p>
               <p>"You have taken me by ſurpriſe, Sir," ſaid Barnwell: "I have as yet determined upon nothing. My mind has not yet recovered from the emotions that have ſo powerfully agitated it. I thank you ſincerely for your generous concern; but I want reflection—I want to be alone!"</p>
               <p>"I will leave you, then, to yourſelf awhile; but I will not relinquiſh my claim to your confidence. Thus far you have acted openly, and worthy of your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:—but, if I am not deceived, it is but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of a ſtruggle, in which you are at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent victor. Adieu, youth, adieu!" and abruptly he departed.</p>
               <p>Barnwell immediately retired to his chamber, and threw himſelf upon the bed. Overcome with want of ſleep and anxiety of mind, he fell into a ſlumber; but even in his ſleep Milwood haunted his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He dreamt—'that he was ſitting in the little temple dedicated to Retirement, in his father's gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and that, from a window, he beheld a wide ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panſe of ground. His mother and Eliza were ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting near him, and he was reading to them Spence's Judgment of Hercules. After he had recited the poem, as he reclined his head on his arm, and muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the view before him, two female forms ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, at a diſtance, reſembling in every reſpect thoſe deſcribed by the poet—
<q>
                     <l>"Both far exceeding human beauty fair;</l>
                     <l>"Graceful—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>'As they drew nearer, a voice which ſeemed to deſcend from above, proclaimed, that the trial was at hand which was to determine his future doom; and that his happineſs or miſery depended upon the choice of the preſent moment. The females contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to advance, and he now beheld their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances

diſtinctly, and immediately recogniſed two well known faces—thoſe of Maria Freeman, and the ſyren Milwood. The former ſupported on one arm a bee-hive, on the top of which, linked by a golden chain, perched two turtle doves: her other arm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined upon a pedeſtal of white marble, on which was inſcribed—"LOVE born of ESTEEM, and cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed by CONSTANCY:—PLEASURES the produce of INDUSTRY!"</p>
               <p>'He was on the point of kneeling before the lovely viſion, when the other female ſtepped gaily on, and placed herſelf before the pedeſtal. Arrayed in a robe,
<q>
                     <l>"that betray'd</l>
                     <l>"Thro' the clear texture ev'ry tender limb,</l>
                     <l>"Height'ning the charms it only ſeem'd to ſhade;</l>
                     <l>"And as it flow'd adown ſo looſe and thin,</l>
                     <l>"Her ſtatue ſhew'd more tall—more ſnowy white her ſkin!"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>'Her right hand held a chalice, into which drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, unpreſſed from a cluſter of grapes ſuſpended by her left, the intoxicating juice. Light as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the air ſhe danced awhile, and then, with graceful agility, ſprung on a pedeſtal of ruby, on which, inſcribed in golden letters, were the words—"LOVE, free as air!—PLEASURES ſtolen from other's TOILS!"</p>
               <p>'He quitted his mother and ſiſter, and deſcended into the plain. As he ſtood wavering before theſe forms, his ſoul, now ſwelled to virtuous atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by the majeſtic look and inſpiring language of the one;—now ſinking into wanton eaſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the alluring glances and the ſyren ſongs of the other. A chorus, in ſound like that which fills the vaults of heaven, from golden harps and angels voices, ſtruck his enamoured ear—
<q>

'As this chorus was ſinging, the female, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled Milwood, ſcoffed by her ſmiles and geſtures the warning voice, and in deriſion flouriſhed her cluſter of grapes in the air; whilſt the form that bore the countenance of Maria, raiſed her fine blue eyes in calm and tranquil contemplation. He turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his attention now wholly on the latter; and the more he gazed, the more lovely ſhe ſeemed.—He was approaching reſpectfully to take her hand, when the Wanton deſcended from the pedeſtal, and again intercepted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> him. She danced before him, and threw herſelf into the moſt captivating attitudes—at intervals kneeling before him, and earneſtly entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to accept the chalice, which ſhe held in her hand.</p>
               <p>'As his mind wavered, and his eyes roved from one form to the other, he reflected on the chorus, and was ſpurning the importunate Wanton, when another chorus arreſted his attention. It aſcended as from a vault beneath his feet, and was preceded by loud peals of laughter. It was accompanied by muſic, but of a different nature from the former: the notes were briſker, and louder, but wanted har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and ſweetneſs. He liſtened, however, and this was the ſtrain—
<q>
                     <l>Can'ſt thou, then, reject the fair?</l>
                     <l>Mark her mien! Her jetty hair</l>
                     <l>Flows luxuriant on her breaſt,</l>

                     <l>Bids thy gen'rous heart rejoice.</l>
                     <l>Taſte the cup that Beauty gives,</l>
                     <l>He alone, who drinks it, lives.</l>
                     <l>Aſk thy youthful, growing fires</l>

               </p>
               <p>'Whilſt he liſtened to this ſong, the ſyren had wove her arms around his neck, and placed the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice to his lips. He taſted the intoxicating draught!

—At that moment the ſhrouded ſhade of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther approached ſolemnly from the temple, with his mother and Eliza in either hand.—As they paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, they looked on him with a countenance of deep felt pity, and walked on towards the pedeſtal where the ſemblance of Maria ſtill remained; but her appearance was changed: the emblems ſhe had held were vaniſhed, and ſhe looked pale as a ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre. As ſoon as the group reached her, the pedeſtal became changed into a ſepulchre, which incloſed within its womb his father, his mother, and Maria, whilſt Eliza ſtood weeping over the tomb as it ſunk.</p>
               <p>'He trembled, and exclaimed in agony—"O, Beauty, what a ſacrifice have I made to thy charms!—Too powerful Beauty, what haſt thou done!" As he ſpoke theſe words, he turned round to Milwood, whom he thought he addreſſed, and found he was claſping a ſkeleton, which grinned horribly at his ſurprize;—and ſtriking him with a lifted dart, occaſioned him ſo ſevere a pain at his heart, that he awoke in inexpreſſible horror.'</p>
               <p>"Merciful Heaven, what a dream!" exclaimed he.—"My mother!—My ſiſter!—my ſainted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, too!—O, God! how ſadly did they gaze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me!—What can ſuch a viſion portend? Surely, I am upon the brink of ſome dreadful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice! Milwood!—Milwood!—ſhall I ever have cauſe to curſe the day we met!—Already have the guilty pleaſures I have—yet, why guilty? Can a form of words be of ſo much import? No, ſurely! Our hearts are united, and our vows are regiſtered in heaven! Why then do I feel as if I had committed a crime? Why does my heart deny me its wonted approbation? Why am I tormented with ſuch phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies? If our paſſions have been ſtrong, ſtill they are not impure!—nor, on my part, ſhall they be ever ſo.

               <p>Such was the ſtate of mind in which Barnwell paſſed the remainder of the day.

uncle's. But why that caution as to promiſes of ſecreſy? Surely Milwood—But whilſt I am arguing, ſhe ſpends the moments in anxious expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation!"</p>
               <p>He ruſhed towards the door, and deſired the man who waited, to conduct him to Milwood.—Immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they met, ſhe ran to him apparently in the greateſt diſtreſs of mind, and hiding her face in his boſom—"O, hide me—hide me, my dear Barnwell, from my purſuers!"</p>
               <p>"Diſpel theſe fears, Madam!" ſaid Barnwell.—"Your alarms may be groundleſs—'Tis poſſible you may have miſtaken the deſcription of another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for your uncle."</p>
               <p>"O, no!" cried Milwood—"I have <hi>

                     </gap>een</hi> him. He purſues me, and will tear me for ever from theſe loved arms!—O, how cruel—how peculiarly cruel is my deſtiny! Perhaps already he has traced my chaiſe to this very door, and will ſoon be here. Let us quit the houſe!"</p>
               <p>Barnwell, alarmed and greatly concerned for her diſtreſs, thought of nothing at the moment but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving it. "Where will you be ſafe?" exclaimed he.</p>
               <p>"Alas! I know not!—But let us this moment quit this place—My trunks may be left here for the preſent—Come, come!"</p>
               <p>She hurried on her cloak, and leaning on his arm, walked towards the door.—They had walked a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable diſtance from the houſe ere Barnwell had ſufficiently recovered from the ſurpriſe her conduct had occaſioned.</p>
               <p>"I am faint!" cried Milwood. This arouſed him; and being near the coach ſtand at Hyde Park Gate, he called a hackney coach. When they were ſeated—"Where am I to drive, your honour?" ſaid the man.</p>
               <p>Milwood leaning her head againſt the ſide of the coach, remained ſilent—Barnwell knew not how to anſwer. After a conſiderable pauſe—"The caſe is
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:038596_0147_10129FA645D0D4A0"/>
this," ſaid Barnwell; "this lady is juſt arrived in town, and we want lodgings—Drive ſlowly along the Brompton road, and if you obſerve an advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at any door, ſtop there."</p>
               <p>The coachman obeyed—They ſtopped at a houſe kept by a widow, and Barnwell hired the lodging at the rate of two guineas a week. Milwood, thus placed in a ſafe retreat, as ſhe pretended, from her uncle, gradually reaſſumed her ſerenity of countenance, and expreſſed her gratitude to Barnwell in the warmeſt language, and by the moſt ſeducing endearments.</p>

               <p>THE pretended fears of Milwood, ſo admirably played, completely anſwered the purpoſe for which ſhe had aſſumed them. Her penetration had eaſily diſcovered that Barnwell's mind, if time was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for reflection, would too ſcrupulouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the queſtion of propriety. She therefore artfully reſolved to take him by ſurpriſe.</p>
               <p>The apartments in Berners Street ſhe had taken for the expreſs purpoſe of their firſt interview, where ſhe had reſided but a few days, and had actually diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them in the manner ſhe had related. The ſtory of her uncle's purſuit was entirely a fiction. Her preſent aim was to obtain an habitation at the expence of Barnwell; and this, it is ſeen, ſhe accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Having thus far ſucceeded, a pauſe in her opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions was neceſſary. She now, therefore, dallied with the unfortunate youth, who was the victim of her arts, and evaded all his inquiries as to her future deſigns. When an air of ſadneſs marked his features, ſhe would ſing—when he hinted his wiſh that they were married, ſhe ſighed deeply, turned her head away from him, and talked on ſome different ſubject;
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:038596_0148_10129FAA63D30158"/>
when he ſpoke of his friends, ſhe affected the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſt agitation; wept (for ſhe could weep at will,) and implored him, as he valued her life, to retain their connection an inviolable ſecret, for at leaſt ſome time to come.</p>
               <p>Barnwell ſtarted, as the caution of Mental, 'never to promiſe ſecreſy,' ruſhed acroſs his memory.—"Why, why ſhould there be ſecreſy?" he exclaimed.</p>
               <p>"Our fates have rendered it moſt neceſſary," ſhe anſwered.—"Ah! Barnwell, you know not yet all the perplexities that rack this heart. Pardon the myſterious veil that for a moment conceals it, and confide in the aſſurance, that it is wholly and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever your's. 'Twere to be wiſhed, that <hi>we</hi>—yes, we (for I will not affect to throw the guilt whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on you) had not yielded to the too powerful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of our paſſions!—But, who can recal the paſt? How uſeleſs, then, it is to repine! Let us, my dear Barnwell, rather conquer, then ſubmit to our fate, and employ ourſelves in a prudent anticipation of the future, in preference to a gloomy retroſpect of the paſt!"</p>
               <p>Such were the blandiſhments with which the ſyren ſoothed the regrets of Barnwell, and ſuch the arts by which ſhe bound him in unfelt ſetters.</p>
               <p>At his return home, the following morning, he ſound a packet of diſpatches from his uncle's. Soon as he ſaw the well known writing, his heart ſmote him.</p>
               <p>For ſome days previous to the unfortunate meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with Milwood, accident had prevented his wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to his ſiſter, with whom he had hitherto regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly correſponded, ſince his arrival in London; and the events which had occurred ſince then were ſuch as he felt no inclination to relate. With the juſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of reproof, therefore, he broke the ſeals, and read the following letters.</p>

               <p>Theſe letters, the ſimple genuine effuſions of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate hearts, were peruſed by Barnwell with mingled ſenſations of pleaſure and pain. When he compared the laſt of them with his ſituation with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to Milwood, he ſhuddered.—</p>
               <p>"What ſteps ſhall I purſue?" ſaid the diſtracted youth. "They charge me with ſilence—How ſhall I ever write again!—I have pledged myſelf to Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood—I have ſworn to be ſecret. If I write, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:038596_0151_10129FB2E48D8F28"/>
I muſt conceal from them my perplexities—I muſt diſguiſe my feelings—I muſt invent occurrences to account for my time.—Dreadful ſituation! And who can foreſee its duration? How long may the too lovely Milwood envelope herſelf in this impenetrable veil of myſtery!</p>
               <p>"I have incurred a certain expence in a proviſion for her—perhaps too far—Oh, God! what a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipice am I deſcending! There is no poſſible way of ſuſtaining my ground, but by a timely diſcloſure of my errors—and from that I am prevented by a raſh oath! Long this ſecrecy cannot laſt. Liberal as my uncle is, his generoſity cannot equal wants of which he never dreams. Why did I make ſo raſh a promiſe! Why ſhould ſhe exact it!—So contrary to my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to my practiſe too!—I hate, I abhor ſecreſy! 'Tis but another name for deception! I will fly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, and retract my engagement. I will convince her how neceſſary it is that our marriage ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately take place, and be declared;—then, even if the anger of my benefactor ſhould overpower his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and affection, I have the world before me—Induſtry ſhall ſupply the neceſſities of nature; and the ſweet reward of ſincerity, my heart's approbation, ſhall make ample amends for the luxuries I loſe. But to continue the mean paths of diſſimulation—to ſtart at every noiſe—to tremble at every glance—exiſting under the uplifted rod of Fear, is worſe, much worſe, than any evil which can reſult from an oppoſite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. This is the voice of prudence, of intereſt—and is in uniſon with the leſſons of morality, and the precepts of religion.—I will obey it inſtantly."</p>
               <p>Such were the inward muſings of Barnwell; ſuch was the noble reſolution of his heart. As he was completely maſter of his own time in Mr. Emery's abſence, he anſwered ſome letters received that morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Buxton, and went immediately to Brompton.</p>

"Abſurd!" ſaid Milwood, with a ſmile half ſatire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> half ſcorn. "Are mankind, then, to walk the paths of ſociety with tranſparent breaſts? Are we to give the world the clue of all our actions? Secrecy, my Barnwell, is a virtue of the firſt claſs in the preſent ſyſtem of things; and the being is as mad, who throws it aſide, as he who ruſhes with a naked breaſt upon an hoſtile ſpear! You are too unacquainted with a tricking world, my Barnwell. When you ſhall know its wiles, how will you laugh at your preſent childiſh notions!"</p>
               <p>"Then may I never know them! I cannot, and I will not be a hypocrite!"</p>
               <p>Barnwell ſpoke this with ſo much earneſtneſs, that Milwood trembled for its conſequences. Turning her powers, therefore, againſt this riſing ſtrength of reſolution, which alarmed her, ſhe burſt into tears, and throwing herſelf into a chair—</p>
               <p>"Go, then, proud youth; proclaim, through the wide circle of your friends, the triumph you have gained; diſplay the ſpoil your conquering charms have won; exhibit my diſgraoe; ſummon to my ears the ſongs of Scorn; and give to foul-mouthed Calumny the prey that you deſpiſe!"</p>
               <p>"How wildly you talk, Madam!" cried Barnwell, ſtill ſtruggling to reſiſt the tender influence he felt.</p>
               <p>"Madam!" echoed Milwood—"Madam!"</p>
               <p>"Pardon me—my—what name—what title ſhall I give you? Why will you not this moment give me a right to call you wife?"</p>
               <p>"Merciful Heaven!" cried Milwood; "are you delirious? <hi>What can add</hi> to the right which <hi>I have</hi> granted you?—What mean you, then? Do you allude to the mummery invented for the uſe of thoſe who have not faculties of their own to define the laws of nature?

               <p>"No, Milwood, no.—In my own eſtimation, you are mine as ſacredly as poſſible. Have we not ſworn a mutual faith in His preſence, who is every where! Our vows are regiſtered by Him—

               <p>"But, you will permit me to add, that if we had the ſanction of Cuſtom (not to ſay the obligation of Law) to our connection, there would exiſt no cauſe of ſecrecy! Thoſe who love me will receive you as my wife; and—"</p>
               <p>"Surely, ſurely you will not imagine my dear Barnwell, that from choice I throw an obſtacle in the way of your propoſal;—it is impoſſible you ſhould think ſo!—but at preſent, for ſome time at leaſt, we <hi>cannot</hi> marry!"</p>
               <p>"What myſtery veils you, Milwood! O, caſt it off. There cannot be a thought that, either of us ſhould engroſs to ourſelves: let me beſeech you to confide in me."</p>
               <p>"Only for a little ſpace of time, my Barnwell, ſpare me. Soon ſhall the veil, that now conceals my heart, for ever be removed:—then ſhall our breaſts be the common repoſitories of our mutual thoughts—there ſhall not be a hope or a fear of one unknown to the other; but ſo blended ſhall become our very thoughts, we ſhall together form but me exiſtence!"</p>
               <p>"And why is that moment poſtponed?"</p>
               <p>"You know not, my dear Barnwell, how you wound me by this uſeleſs importunity. I do not form my reſolutions on caprice, but on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

exiſting cauſes. I act from motives, not from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe; elſe I might, by your perſuaſions, be moved to reveal a ſecret, that my reaſon now denies you. However much, therefore, your importunities may afflict my heart, they ſhall not, they cannot, ſubdue the ſovereign power of intellectual deciſion!"</p>
               <p>"Extraordinary woman!" cried Barnwell. "How, then, am I to act? Say, Milwood, had you a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and a ſiſter whom you loved, and to whom you had been accuſtomed to reveal your inmoſt thoughts, could you refrain from recounting ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"What can be more eaſily decided than your queſtion? Aſk yourſelf, what benefit you can expect from revealing theſe events?—You would merely create an hoſt of painful apprehenſions in thoſe breaſts, which you wiſh ſhould be the manſions of peace; and the only poſſible reſult of their knowing what has paſſed, would be a painful anxiety to know more than it is at preſent in your power to reveal."</p>
               <p>"And yet, to conceal the true ſtate of my mind, I muſt fein a ſatisfaction I do not feel; I muſt aſſume an indifference to which my heart is a ſtranger. How can I anſwer ſuch letters as theſe?"</p>
               <p>Barnwell then gave her the three letters he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the morning.—When ſhe had peruſed them—</p>
               <p>"Your ſiſter is an amiable girl; and your mother is, doubtleſs, a good woman," ſaid ſhe; "but I ſcarcely know how to pronounce on your uncle. His letters of prudence ſeem more the acquiſitions of habit, than the ſuggeſtions of his own reaſon. He is very rich, I preſume?"</p>
               <p>"I underſtand ſo."</p>
               <p>"And as no children?"</p>
               <p>"None."</p>
               <p>"Your mother and ſiſter reſide with him:—of courſe to acquaint them with our connection, would be the ſame as informing your uncle."</p>

               <p>Barnwell ſmiled.</p>
               <p>"I perceive, my Barnwell," continued ſhe, "the ſtate of your mind. It has hitherto been too much ſwayed by prejudice early imbibed, and ſtill unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined. But as you advance in life, you will diſcover, that the wiſeſt and the beſt of mankind find it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to model their actions by given rules. The incidents of life hinge ſo entirely on chance, that our ſituations, relatively and individually, aſſume many complex ſhapes; and are perpetually at variance with defined notions of duty. 'Tis, therefore, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to exhibit a ſtandard of virtue or vice.</p>
               <p>"Let us apply this obſervation to your preſent ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:—You ſay you cannot be a hypocrite! I grant you, hypocriſy is claſſed amongſt what are called vices; but will any one ſay, that to diſtreſs the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a mother and ſiſter, to wound their hearts with the arrows of perplexing doubts and apprehenſions, is more virtuous, than ſimply to conceal the events which have paſſed, and which were not the effects of our own deſigns? Such a doctrine ſcarcely merits a moment's thought!"</p>
               <p>By theſe and ſimilar arguments, did this miſtreſs of diſſimulation at length defeat the noble purpoſes of that ſincerity which hitherto had dwelt in Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's breaſt, and he fatally reſolved to keep his friends in ignorance of his ſituation.</p>
               <p>In the honeſty of his nature, he had confeſſed to Milwood, that he had mentioned the affair to <hi>one</hi> friend, but that he was ignorant of any thing that had occurred ſince their ſecond interview; and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by her tears, her arguments, and her perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, he promiſed he would never allow himſelf to mention her again even to this <hi>one</hi> friend, nor would ever ſuffer him to name her to himſelf.</p>
               <p>This was the preciſe point which the arts of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood aimed to accompliſh; for ſhe well knew that,

among the many and various errors to which youth and inexperience are expoſed, there is none more fatal in its conſequences, than the concealment of having committed them. The firſt deviating ſteps from the paths of rectitude, may often be retraced by the aid of friendly council; but he who denies himſelf that timely aid, will in vain implore its ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy when entangled in the maze of deception; and when every avenue on the return to happineſs is obſtructed by ſome unexpected obſtacle.</p>

               <p>THOUGH Barnwell's inclination led him to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote the whole of his leiſure to the company of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, reſpect to Mr. Emery pointed out the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a viſit to the Pavilion, where he had lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſtranger.</p>
               <p>'Twas a delightful evening in September, when, for the firſt time ſince his acquaintance with Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, he arrived there. A period of ten or twelve days had elapſed ſince his laſt viſit, and he was fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his apology as he walked his horſe ſlowly round the paling of the Park, and was near the Porter's Lodge, when he was arouſed by the ſweet notes of a guitar, iſſuing from the Park. When he alighted, as he gave his horſe to the porter, he inquired who was the performer.</p>
               <p>"'Tis one of the young ladies that be here on a viſit," ſaid the man. "I thinks they do call her Miſs Freeman; but our young ladies do call her Maria—a ſweet young lady ſhe is too! ſhe do a world of good wherever ſhe goes;—old and young

do pray for bleſſings on her: and yet I be hugely out in my reck'ning and ſhe be'nt very unhappy!"</p>
               <p>"Why do you think ſo, Wilmot?" ſaid Barnwell, who was intereſted at his account.</p>
               <p>"Why your honour, ſhe be ſo mopiſh, and lone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and do never ſeem to make merry with the gentlefolks; but walks, and walks, alone, all day; and then ſhe do ſigh mightily—and be grown ſo pale!—It is a main pity, your honour, that ſhe, who do take ſuch pains to make every body happy, ſhould not be happy herſelf!"</p>
               <p>"Pity, indeed!" replied Barnwell, who encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his loquacity, that he might diſcover if any thing had occurred in his abſence—for old Wilmot had the talent of extracting from one or other of the domeſtics the whole news, of the Pavilion. One of the grooms having taken his horſe, he followed Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mot into the Lodge, under pretence of admiring his grand-children—"What a fine fellow this!" ſaid he, patting a chubby-faced little boy on the head;—"and thoſe are charming little girls!"</p>
               <p>"I do thank heaven," cried the old man, "they be brave and hearty."</p>
               <p>—"And only look, an' pleaſe your honour," ſaid the mother, "what <hi>beautiful fine</hi> dimity coats, and what <hi>lovely fine</hi> frocks the dear Miſs Freeman has made for them, with her own hands!"</p>
               <p>"Ah!" reſumed the old man, "ſhe is to be pitied, ſweet lady!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," cried his daughter; "if what Mrs. Watſon, my lady's maid, ſays, be true, it is a hard caſe for ſuch a beautiful and lovely charming good angel to be croſſed in love!—for every body ſays it is love. Lord, I declare it makes one's heart ache to ſee her moping about, when all the reſt of the grand gentlefolks are riding out, or fiſhing, or dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, or <hi>archering,</hi> or—"</p>
               <p>Juſt as ſhe was ſpeaking, Maria, ignorant of Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's arrival, ſtrolled into the Lodge. Her eyes were thrown penſively upon the ground, her guitar
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:038596_0159_1012A0CA77640DC0"/>
hung on her arm. She appeared much changed in her countenance, and ſighed deeply ſtill. Barnwell could not behold her without a recollection of his dream. He ſat in a corner of the little room, and Maria, lifting up her eyes, ſaw him—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Barnwell here!" exclaimed ſhe, with a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary bluſh that ſuffuſed her pale cheek. The ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe appeared to have overcome her, and ſhe trembled.</p>
               <p>"I am admiring Wilmot's grand-children," ſaid Barnwell, with ſome heſitation.—"I have been—that is, I have been—I mean, it is a conſiderable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"How is the poor woman at farmer Jaſper's," ſaid Maria to old Wilmot, appearing not to notice the too evident embarraſſment of Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"O, my ſweet lady, ſhe be <hi>quite another gueſs</hi> thing; and ſhe do talk of nothing but her good angel. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow ſhe do mean to pay you her reſpects, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thanks for—"</p>

               <p>"Permit me to carry that inſtrument," ſaid he.</p>
               <p>"No, Sir," replied Maria, coolly.</p>
               <p>"You ſeem fatigued—will you honor me by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting my arm?"</p>
               <p>"No, Sir," replied ſhe again.</p>

               <p>She walked on in ſilence. Barnwell was really concerned. He eſteemed Maria ere he felt the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of love, and valued her good opinion too highly to part with it with indifference. They reached the houſe without exchanging another word.</p>

As they entered the ſaloon, Miſs Emery was play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſerious air of Banti's on the piano, which ſhe immediately changed for—"<hi>See the conquering hero come!</hi>" which ſhe accompanied with her voice.—Mrs. Emery, Miſs Charlotte, Lord Morley, and Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"Moſt puiſſant, and renowned Conqueror of hearts, Colonel Commandant of the <hi>Corps</hi> of <hi>Cupids!</hi> whoſe head-quarters are your brilliant eyes, whoſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"The annals of Love are but the records of your conqueſts," continued Charlotte, "and wherever we turn our wondering eyes, we view the victims of your charms!"</p>
               <p>As ſhe ſaid this, ſhe fixed her eyes ſignificantly upon Maria, who ſeemed hurt by the alluſion. Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well was no better pleaſed. Regardleſs, however, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> the pain ſhe created, ſo long as Mr. Eaſtwood admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and the others laughed, ſhe continued—</p>
               <p>"But ceaſe, mighty conqueror, ceaſe this havoc among beauties; deign to conſider the miſery you extend, and the woes you increaſe. Let the languid eyes, the pallid cheeks, the painful ſighs, the palpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating hearts of thoſe, who have already fallen, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for ſacrifices; check the cruel career of conqueſt, and diſtribute the conſolation of your preſence more equitably among your ſlaves!

in juſtice, as you do in ſplendor, the equal revolutions of that glorious orb!"</p>
               <p>Barnwell was petrified with aſtoniſhment at this rhapſody. He could not fail to underſtand her meaning, but was loſt in wonder how his viſits to Brompton could have reached the Pavilion.</p>
               <p>"Come, come," cried Lord Morley, "be merciful, Charlotte, as you are powerful. You ſee how you make the poor youth bluſh!'</p>
               <p>Barnwell was really embarraſſed—"Upon my word," cried he, after ſeveral attempts, "you are very entertaining!"</p>
               <p>"Do you think ſo?" cried Charlotte archly. "Well, then, now I'll be ſerious—quite in <hi>right ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt;</hi>" and drawing herſelf ſtiffly upright in her chair, with her thumbs twirling round each other—"If you pleaſe, Mr. Barnwell, how do you like the air at Brompton? I hope it agrees with your health."</p>
               <p>"I beg your pardon—I—really don't underſtand you."</p>
               <p>"Shall I explain myſelf then, Sir, before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>Maria was looking earneſtly at her whilſt ſhe ſpoke. Barnwell beginning to apprehend ſhe really knew more than ſhe had yet hinted, found no way left but to return her raillery, however ſeverely he felt her obſervations—</p>
               <p>"I think I have a right to call for an adjournment," ſaid he, "as your proceedings are as irregular as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt. You ſhould certainly have given notice of the meaſure you intended to bring before the houſe."</p>
               <p>"Guilty—Guilty, upon my honour," cried Lord Morley; or he would never have evaded a trial upon a point of form."—</p>
               <p>"Well," cried Barnwell, "I ſuppoſe you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand one another; but it is all croſs purpoſes to me."</p>
               <p>"O, I dare ſay you think them <hi>croſs</hi> enough," cried Charlotte; "but if people will ſet themſelves

up for <hi>Joſephs,</hi> and one ſhould by accident diſcover them to be <hi>no</hi> Joſephs, why the conſequence is—What ails you child!" breaking off, and addreſſing herſelf to Maria, who complained of a giddineſs in her head, and fainted.</p>
               <p>A buſtle enſued, during which, Barnwell, finding his ſervices uſeleſs, retired to his own room.</p>
               <p>His own reflections were no more pleaſing than the railleries of Charlotte Emery. His connection with Milwood was evidently known at the Pavilion. It might alſo have reached the ears of his mother, and his uncle. Milwood herſelf was grown, if poſſible, more myſterious. Her expences increaſed rapidly, and his own finances became ſtraitened, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his excellent management previous to his acquaintance with her. The diſdain of Maria, too, ſat not eaſy on his heart: he knew her to be as ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in mind as lovely in perſon; and no longer doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but the report of a clandeſtine connection had loſt him her eſteem, if not a more tender regard; he moſt bitterly lamented the fate, that prohibited his offering any explanation in juſtification of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct.</p>
               <p>The long intervals betwixt the broken ſlumbers of the night were, therefore, occupied in a train of thoughts, neither ſatisfactory in a ſurvey of the paſt, nor in a contemplation of the future. Regret follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Fear preceded him.</p>
               <p>Nor was the breaſt of Maria tranquil. Her mind, endowed by nature with a quick ſuſceptibility of ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſentiments, had imbibed for Barnwell an affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fatal to her peace. His perſon was handſome, his countenance intereſting; but thoſe exteriors had little influenced the thinking Maria. 'Twas the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive elegance of his manners, the integrity and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of his ſentiments, and the noble tenor of his conduct, that had gained him ſo honorable a diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in her boſom. This diſtinction had increaſed continually by a compariſon with the young men who viſited Mr. Emery.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="164" facs="unknown:038596_0163_10129FCE4E767038"/>
Among the ſwarm of faſhionable flies that buzzed perpetually about her, ſhe ſought in vain for his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginality of mind, his purity of thought. One was conſpicuous for his diſguſting rudeneſs, practiſed by miſtake for affability; others, for an equally diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obſequiouſneſs, that ſet all appreciation of their minds at complete defiance: this entertained her with the hiſtory of the theatres, and retailed the ſcandal of venomous tongues to the prejudice of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers; whilſt others, could ſhe have liſtened to them, would have taught her the whole art of farri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and ſtored her mind with the true principles of <hi>nicking, docking, cropping,</hi> and <hi>training horſes.</hi>

               <p>But when opportunity favored her with the ſociety of Barnwell, <hi>her</hi> mind expanded in the purſuit of <hi>his</hi> ideas <hi>her</hi> heart glowed at the congenial effuſions of <hi>his;</hi> and ſhe felt at once delighted and improved. Such a diſtinguiſhing eſteem naturally, though imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly ſoftened into Love; and Maria was ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at her own ſituation when ſhe firſt diſcovered how neceſſary was the preſence of Barnwell to the ſatisfaction of her heart.</p>
               <p>This diſcovery ſhe made, when, day after day, he abſented himſelf for above a week from the Pavilion; which, all gaiety as it was, appeared in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Maria the very temple of Dullneſs, without the ſociety of Barnwell. But if a doubt was left on her mind reſpecting the ſtate of her heart, it vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the pain, the moſt exquiſite pain, ſhe endured, when through the tattle of ſervants, (which Barnwell never ſuſpected) his nightly viſits to Brompton were made known at the Pavilion.</p>
               <p>Then did the boſom of Maria ſwell with anguiſh, unfelt before. She doubted, ſhe ſcrupled to believe, that Barnwell would be guilty of intrigue; and yet there was no way of acquitting him, but by ſuppoſing he had entered into more ſolemn, and laſting engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Either ſuppoſition wounded her heart. She grew melancholy and thoughtful; and the ſtruggle of her reaſon and her love ſapped the foundations of her health.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="165" facs="unknown:038596_0164_10129FD2BA0D1580"/>
Such was the ſituation of Maria, when the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of Barnwell in the ſaloon confirmed her in the opinion that, if ever he had been worthy of her eſteem, he had now relinquiſhed that claim. The anguiſh ſuch conviction occaſioned her, was too pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful for her delicate mind, and was the cauſe of her fainting.</p>
               <p>With Maria therefore, as well as with Barnwell, the night paſſed heavily on; and when the glorious orb of day chaſed darkneſs from the earth, neither Barnwell nor Maria could hail, with a tranquil breaſt, thoſe gladdening beams, that heretofore had kindled in their hearts the glow of grateful joy.</p>

               <p>A POSTCHAISE and four was at the door when Barnwell arrived, the following morning, at Portland Place. Mr. Emery had juſt returned from Buxton. He immediately paid his reſpects to him in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.—</p>
               <p>"So Barnwell!" ſaid Mr. Emery, as he walked haſtily about the room:—his eyes were red and ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—his aſpect lowering—his brows knitted—not one trace was left in his countenance of his former eaſe and gaiety.</p>
               <p>Barnwell was heſitating whether to retire or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main; when Mr. Emery, putting his hand to his head, exclaimed—</p>
               <p>"What an infernal crew!—What devils upon earth!—Blood-ſuckers that feed upon the vitals of their fellows!—Curſe them!—curſe them!" Then
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:038596_0165_10129FD592D9E1C8"/>
turning ſuddenly round—"What are you ſtaring at?" cried he to Barnwell.—"Did I ſend for you? Go—Stay—Where's my wife?"</p>
               <p>"At the Pavilion, Sir."</p>
               <p>"<hi>Pavilion!</hi> Ha—ha—ha!—"'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been ſlave to thouſands!"</p>
               <p>There was a wildneſs, approaching to madneſs, in the manner and words of Mr. Emery, that ſtruck Barnwell with ſurpriſe and horror; yet, ignorant of the cauſe, he was unable to offer conſolation to his deſpair, had his ſituation allowed him the privilege. After two or three paces round the room—"Write me a note," cried Mr. Emery, with a quickneſs that ſtartled him. Barnwell liſtened to his indicting—</p>
               <p>"Mr. Emery will eſteem himſelf highly obliged, if Mr. Negotiate will call in Portland Place, as early this morning as poſſible."</p>

               <p>Barnwell obeyed his orders with promptneſs, and returned with intelligence, that Mr. Negotiate was juſt ſtepping into his chariot, to fulfil an appointment at the Treaſury, and would wait on Mr. Emery as he returned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Negotiate was a money-broker; a man ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be immenſely rich; who, from the facility with which he could convert remote ſecurities into ready caſh, was a neceſſary confidante of the needy, both at Court and 'Change. He was a little thin man, and always ſeemed ready to ſink <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

He was pompous and proud to thoſe who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his aſſiſtance; obſequious and meanly ſubmiſſive where <hi>he</hi> wanted aſſiſtance.</p>
               <p>About one he arrived. Barnwell was withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing when he entered the library—"Stay;" ſaid Mr. Emery, "we muſt have a witneſs; and you who al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready half know my embarraſſments, may as well know the whole."</p>

"There, now," cried Negotiate, who was a Jew, "I vas thought as much.—Embarraſhment, embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſhment!—Every body <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"Why, for the preſent," ſaid Mr. Emery, "ſix thouſand will do."</p>
               <p>"Got Almighty! Vere vas you think I can ſcrape ſo much money? 'Tiſh impoſſible! Good morning, Miſhter Emery—Good morning—You muſt inquire furder. But I vill tell you one thing—your friend, the Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Negotiate always made it a point to refuſe in the firſt inſtance, that, by the effects of diſappointment upon his victim, he might judge of their emergency, and offer terms accordingly. After a variety of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties were, at length, diſpatched, he advanced the ſum required, upon the ſecurity of the eſtate at the Pavilion, at an enormous premium, and on a bond to reimburſe ſtock to the amount ſold out, be the price at its expiration ever ſo diſproportionate.</p>
               <p>This tranſaction opened a new ſcene to Barnwell, and filled his mind with the moſt ſerious reflections, in which the peril of his own ſituation was not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten.

In vain you aim to fit a maſk upon your ſoul: it ſpurns it, and will burſt the fetters of deception.

It <hi>was</hi> your cuſtom to deſcribe to us the events of every day. What then is the nature of thoſe engagements you keep back from our knowledge? Your ſituation muſt be changed, indeed, if preſs of <hi>buſineſs</hi> has ſo quickly ſucceeded a <hi>leiſure,</hi> of which you formerly complained! Ah, George, that leiſure, in ſuch a place as London, ever occaſioned our dear parent ſome concern for you. But when we found it devoted to the improvement of mind, to the elegant purſuits of literature, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly when ſpontaneouſly you devoted ſo large a portion of it to a correſpondence, that brought us, as it were, daily into each other's preſence, her heart glowed with gratitude to the memory of him, who is now no more, as ſhe hailed with joy the ſweet bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms of his early cultivation.</p>
                     <p>Shall we then be deceived at laſt! Say, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, were thoſe bloſſoms ſo tender, that Temptation's tempeſt can have blighted them? Forgive the

Some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion has, for a while, ſhed its ſombre influence over a mind, that cannot be at once in error, and at eaſe. Is it ſo, my dear brother? I have a right to preſume it is, from your conduct; for on no other ground can I define it. And if it ſhould be ſo, what have we ever done, that our hearts are denied their juſt right to a knowledge of your imperfections? How often have the imperfections of human nature been our theme! How often have we pitied the poor diſciples of modern philoſophy, who boaſt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe.

It muſt be falſe ſhame, or falſe fear, then, that has betrayed my dear brother into the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of his errors.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps you may imagine, that to acquaint us with them, would occaſion us pain; and that what we do not know, we cannot regret. Fatal deluſion! How many wrecks of promiſed happineſs has that rock occaſioned! Moſt, who opproach it, periſh. Examine this ſpecious ſuggeſtion of Pride—It is no more. We are unwilling to deſcend in the eſteem of thoſe we love, and we conceal from their knowledge indiſcretions, which we imagine would have that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; forgetting that, by the very concealment, we practiſe a crime, inſtead of committing an error; and are guilty of the meaneſt hypocriſy, in paſſing our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon our friends for ſuch miracles of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as make a compariſon with their own experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, painful. Beſides the meanneſs of this decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it will be found impolitic. It is the unvarying law of nature, that all cauſes produce effects. Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, then, muſt have its conſequences. And how frequently is it ſeen, that the conſequences declare the indiſcretion to thoſe, from whom we have ſought to conceal it! and then how contemptible do we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, from the very act, which we vainly imagined the prop of our characters!</p>

moſt ſecret thoughts had been ever open, Barnwell again bent his footſteps towards Brompton.</p>
               <p>As he entered the houſe, Mrs. Griffiths, the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady, accoſted him, and requeſted he would walk into <hi>her</hi> parlour, as ſhe had ſomething of conſequence to ſay to him.

               <p>Mrs. Griffiths had, about five months ſince decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interred the <hi>poor dear ſoul,</hi> her ſecond huſband, who had been paſtor of a diſſenting congregation.

At laſt he prevailed upon me to believe, that keeping the ſign of the Goat was a ſinful way of life; and turning what I had into money, I entered the holy ſtate once more, and we lived at a little place a few miles from London. Here he got acquainted with ſome people that belonged to the Meeting, and they made him their parſon. I ſaw then how it would turn out.—'What does it ſignify, Mr. Griffiths,' ſays I, 'your tearing your lungs to pieces, four times a day, in this manner, to people who won't give a bit of bread to your poor Dolly, when you have got your death by them?' and ſo, ſure enough, it was. <hi>He preached</hi> himſelf into a galloping conſumption; <hi>t'other dri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The patience of Barnwell, was, by this time, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely exhauſted; and he was riſing to depart, when Mrs. Griffiths prevented him.</p>
               <p>"But now, Sir, I <hi>comes</hi> to what I was agoing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark to you. You ſee how I am <hi>ſittyated;</hi> and that I am not able to afford to looſe by my lodgers. To be ſure, the church does allow me a paltry twenty pounds a year; but that's no dependence, as I don't go to their place, and, indeed, don't much like their pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers without books, where one don't know what they're agoing to ſay. Beſides, if I ſhould alter my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion again, which there's no telling, I dare ſay they'd take it off: and ſo, what I ſay is—its my own <hi>look-out</hi> I muſt depend on; and I can't afford to loſe."—</p>
               <p>"I don't underſtand, Madam, what all this leads to," cried Barnwell, interrupting her. "You are very regularly paid, and well paid."</p>
               <p>"As to that, two guineas a week for what this Mrs. God-knows-who has, its little enough."</p>
               <p>"More reſpect, if you pleaſe, when you mention that lady!"—</p>
               <p>"I doesn't mean to affront you, Sir; but I muſt look after my own. To be ſure, you have paid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular enough as yet; and ſo did the gentleman, at firſt, that I loſt—"</p>
               <p>"Mrs. Griffiths," ſaid Barnwell, extremely vexed, and taking his hat in his hand—"if you have any thing to ſay that concerns <hi>me,</hi> pray ſay it at once; but if you are going to begin any more ſtories, you muſt excuſe me."</p>
               <p>"Why then, Sir, if you are for being ſo blunt—pray, who are you, and what are you? When you took my lodgings, it was all in a hurry, as I may ſay, and I went upon your appearance; but it is my wiſh now to have a proper reference for your cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. I have particular reaſons for it!"</p>
               <p>"Barnwell ſtarted involuntarily, and bluſhed—"What reaſons?" exclaimed he.</p>
               <p>"Nay, for what I know, you may have your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies!"</p>
               <p>

"Explain, Madam—I inſiſt upon it. I am nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally warm and haſty in my diſpoſition; and I hate all this preface"</p>
               <p>"Why then, Sir, I'll tell you the whole buſineſs."</p>
               <p>"As briefly as you can," cried Barnwell.</p>
               <p>She then related that—"this morning, as ſhe was ſitting at the window, ſhe noticed an old gentleman, plainly dreſſed, who walked three or four times paſt the houſe with particular obſervation. At length he bowed to her, and knocked at the door. Upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhewn into the parlour, he bluntly aſked her, if ſhe let lodgings; and then as abruptly deſired to know the name of her preſent tenants. When ſhe informed him, Barnwell—he exclaimed—'Then I am right. Is the lady within who accompanied Mr. Barnwell here?' "Upon finding he knew the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance," continued Mrs. Griffiths, "I anſwered, yes. He then deſired to ſee her. I went up ſtairs, and told the lady; but ſhe refuſed to ſee him unleſs he came with any meſſage from yourſelf. The old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was too ſcrupulous to tell a ſtory; but ſent up word—He did not come with your knowledge, but that he came as your friend; and only wiſhed to intrude upon her time five minutes. But ſhe poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly refuſed him. 'This looks ill!' ſaid the old gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman; and he ſat talking to himſelf a good while.—'I ſhould like too ſee this lady,' ſaid he, 'even if I did not ſpeak to her. Could you manage this for me?' I told him, that ſhe generally walked in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den in the courſe of the morning; and that, if he pleaſed, he might ſtop and ſee her paſs the windows of the back parlour. He did ſo; and we talked of you, Sir. He acquainted me, that this lady was one of thoſe <hi>deſpicable</hi> huſſies, that ought, in my opinion, to be burnt alive; and that you was going to ruin head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; and that it was ten to one if you was able to pay <hi>me,</hi> for that you was only a <hi>marchant's</hi> clerk."</p>
               <p>"<hi>He</hi> told you this?—<hi>He</hi> ſay this of me?—Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible!" cried Barnwell; for he inſtantly conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it could be no other than Mental.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="unknown:038596_0174_10129FECF9B7A280"/>
"Yes, but he did; and much more he would have ſaid, had not the lady juſt then paſſed the window. She turned round to pluck a flower, and ſo he had a full view of her face. Starting up like a madman, as ſoon as he ſaw it, he claſped his hands together, and, ſtriking his forehead, ruſhed out of the houſe before I was aware."</p>
               <p>"This is all very extraordinary," cried Barnwell—"very extraordinary, indeed!—Pray, have you acquainted the lady with this circumſtance?"</p>
               <p>"No, not I, Sir. The lady, as you call her, muſt find more ſuitable companions; and you, if you pleaſe, <hi>a m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Barnwell, at once diſguſted, vexed, and ſurpriſed, left her without a word, and ſought Milwood. She met him as he entered the room—</p>
               <p>"Why, my dear Barnwell, is your brow thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly clouded?"</p>
               <p>He anſwered not, but throwing himſelf on the ſofa—</p>
               <p>"I ſhall never be happy again," murmured he "O! Milwood, what a wretch have you made me! I was baſking in bliſs—I knew not a painful reflection—and now, I can neither conſult my friends, nor my own heart—I have grown deſpicable in the eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of both!—You have deſtroyed my tranquillity for ever!"</p>
               <p>"From you this language, Barnwell!—From you, for whom I have ſacrificed not only friends, but for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune—nay, for whom I have ſacrificed the delicacy of my ſex—and have incurred a ſhame never to be effaced!—Who is moſt the ſufferer, Barnwell—you, who have ſhared equally in all the pleaſures of our connection, and, in the world's opinion, have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a triumph—or I, who, for my portion of rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turous moments have to encounter the evils of years, unborn?—Yet will I never repine—I, who am a woman, will yet be philoſopher enough, not to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the price of my pleaſure!—No, my Barnwell," throwing her arms round his neck—"no!—though
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:038596_0175_10129FF158357AB0"/>
exiſtence was that price!—What, then, can you repine at?"</p>
               <p>"At the myſtery which encircles her I love!" ſaid Barnwell;—"at the neceſſity of ſecreſy, which I ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor! Milwood, I feel about my heart the weight of a crime!—Never ſhall I feel one happy moment till I can introduce you to my friends—ſolicit their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs—and regain their eſteem. Let me, then, haſten the return of happineſs to us both, by the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly means that are left us."</p>
               <p>"I underſtand you, Barnwell—I perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand you; and would to God that obſtacles, inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable obſtacles, did not prevent our adoption of thoſe means. But, once for all—know, that the ſtep, to which you allude, is—quite impoſſible."</p>
               <p>"Impoſſible!—Milwood, do I hear you rightly—Impoſſible?"</p>
               <p>Milwood wept, and ſighed.</p>
               <p>"Tell me, moſt myſterious woman, and, by one word, for ever ſeal my doom—Are you already married?"</p>
               <p>Milwood remained ſilent.</p>
               <p>"Nay, anſwer me, I beſeech you," continued Barnwell. "The certainty that it is ſo cannot be more tormenting than this ſuſpenſe. Tell me, then, at once, how guilty and how miſerable a wretch I am."</p>
               <p>"O, Barnwell!—thy cruel penetration has woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my ſoul!—I am—nay, ſtart not, fly not from me—I am—already—married!—"</p>
               <p>Barnwell, in an agony, burſt from her arms, and ruſhed towards the door. He had ſeized the handle of the lock, when, with a ſhriek, Milwood fainted on the ſafa. His tenderneſs returned in an inſtant, as he ſaw her beauteous perſon extended lifeleſs on the ſofa. He rang the bell violently; Mrs. Griffiths and her ſervant came up, and he aſſiſted them in their ſervices. Half opening her eyes, the artful Milwood obſerved his attentions—</p>
               <p>"He has left me—he is gone—he is gone for
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:038596_0176_10129FF5CA739150"/>
ever!" exclaimed ſhe. Then appearing to recover, and ſtarting at the ſight of him, ſhe caught his hand, and kiſſing it rapturouſly—"O, this is god-like, indeed!" ſaid ſhe.</p>
               <p>Barnwell, finding ſhe recovered, diſmiſſed the landlady and her ſervant, and tenderly ſupported her in his own arms. He could not, however, ſo far diſguiſe his feelings, as to appear otherwiſe than of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.</p>
               <p>"Ah! why was this cruelty exerted!" ſaid ſhe—"why have you ſaved me from death, if thus you gaze on me!—Never! never can I bear thoſe reprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eyes!—Never can I ſupport your anger, Barnwell. This ſcornful ſilence too! The bitter reproaches were kinder than this cold ſilence, Barnwell!"</p>
               <p>"What can I ſay to thee, thou dangerous woman?—You, Milwood, may deem adultery no crime; but I—."</p>
               <p>"<hi>You,</hi> Barnwell, are no adulterer—you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent—I, indeed, am guilty!—But the love I cheriſh for you is all my heart approves.—Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to marry another, I have vowed at the altar to be his; but never have thoſe vows been ſanction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my heart—they were tortured from my lips—but never has my perſon yielded to ſuch legalized pollution. From that memorable day I became a fugitive, and only approached the altar with that view. A priſoner, in the ſtricteſt ſenſe, I had no other alternative, than to yield my hand to a loathed bridegroom, whom, from that hour to this, I never have beheld."</p>
               <p>Barnwell ſat ſilently muſing on the ſofa; his hands were folded in each other, and his eyes fixed on the floor.</p>
               <p>"Still you are ſilent, Barnwell. I ſee the riſing ſcorn, that ſits upon your lips; I know the innate delicacy of your pure mind revolts at the deſperate actions of a phrenſy ſtricken woman, whom cruel tyranny and unbounded love unite to plunge into deſpair. I will not aim to leſſen your diſguſt; it is
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:038596_0177_10129FF75C7E5F60"/>
the only remedy for my ill-fated paſſion. Go then, too lovely youth; go, and forget for ever, the loſt—loſt Milwood!—Go, and in ſome other's arms, be bleſt!—while I, in a lone corner of the earth, mourn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'er thy memory, and bleſs thy name."</p>
               <p>"Yes, Madam," cried Barnwell; ſtarting from his reverie—"I perceive no other mode of action:—there appears one only outlet from this ſea of guilty pleaſures;—where, longer to remain, muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction!"</p>
               <p>"I know your dreadful meaning, Sir:—'Tis cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, but 'tis neceſſary. We muſt part; and, ſince I have become ſo loathſome to your ſight, the rudeſt deſarts will be preferable to your preſence. No—I could never ſtay to be deſpiſed by you!"—</p>
               <p>Here the ſyren ſhed a flood of artificial tears, that tortured Barnwell to the very ſoul. The extreme ſenſibility of his nature ſubjected him to extremes in ſentiment: now, moſt tenderly he pitied the miſeries of Milwood; then, the memory of his family ruſhed acroſs his mind—he ſaw their indignant frowns, he heard their rebukes, for a conduct ſo unworthy of them, and of himſelf. Again, when he reflected on the dreadful fate of her, who had abandoned ſo much for his ſake, he was ready to extend his hand, and vow eternal truth. Again, the taunts of the world, the revenge of an injured huſband, and the ignominy to himſelf and friends, of a public accuſation, check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſoftneſs quivering on his lips, which only eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped by a painful ſigh.—</p>
               <p>In this conflict of his mind, memory placed before him the viſion he had ſeen in his ſleep: he felt the alluſion of the ſcene moſt ſtrongly; the very counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of his father was preſent, and ſummoned a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution in his breaſt, that conquered every oppoſition. Approaching the ſofa with tremulous voice—</p>
               <p>"Painful to me, Milwood, are thoſe tears; but, after the knowledge I have obtained of your ſituation, to continue a connection—"</p>
               <p>"I know it muſt not be," interrupted ſhe:—"I
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:038596_0178_10129FFD0DBC6350"/>
know the jaundiced eye of prejudice views in it all the hideous colorings of vice! I aſk it not, my Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well—heart-breaking is the ſacrifice; but to your peace of mind, I will ſurrender, even yourſelf! Yet, do not add to the horrors of ſuch a ſeparation, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting the miſery of thinking that I am deſpiſed by you. Say that you do not hate me; and—"</p>
               <p>"Hate you!—O, Milwood—have I not preferred you, even to virtue? And now, if you knew the ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle of my heart, you would ſee it is impoſſible to hate you!"</p>
               <p>"Generous—generous Barnwell!—why ſhould the cold and rigid arbitration of an ill-judging world ſever ſuch hearts as ours!"</p>
               <p>As ſhe ſpoke, ſhe twined her arms around his neck; her palpitating heart beat againſt his boſom, and her warm kiſſes brought on a delirium of ecſtaſy.</p>
               <p>At this moment the door opened, and three men, in maſks, ruſhed into the room. Milwood ſhrieked and fainted. Two of theſe intruders held Barnwell on the ſofa, and prevented his cries; whilſt the other conveyed Milwood away in his arms.</p>
               <p>Barnwell in vain exerted himſelf againſt ſuperior ſtrength, as no perſon came to his aſſiſtance. In about ten minutes the third man returned, and beckoned the other to follow him. They left Barnwell gagged and bound. A conſiderable time elapſed before Mrs. Griffiths and her ſervant made their appearance, crying and lamenting moſt bitterly, having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone the ſame treatment as Barnwell.</p>
               <p>When they had releaſed him, he raved with the fury of a maniac; impeached the integrity of the poor women, who ſtood trembling at his anger; and gave the reins to the paſſions of jealouſy and deſpair.</p>
               <p>The ſtrength of his unhappy attachment, was at no period ſo viſible as now. The uncertainty of her fate, the tormenting apprehenſions he felt for her ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, engroſſed his whole ſoul.</p>
               <p>The houſe being ſituated at a diſtance from any other, he could obtain no intelligence by inquiries.</p>

Having, after a conſiderable time, ſomewhat ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted the firſt and violent burſts of paſſion, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to liſten to the reaſonings of Mrs. Griffiths; and the only probable concluſion that he could draw, was, that the old gentleman, who had been there in the morning, and was ſo deſirous of ſeeing Milwood, and who, he had ſuppoſed, was Mental, muſt have been her uncle, who had taken this method of carrying her off to her huſband.</p>
               <p>As his preſent ſtate of mind prevented his return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing immediately to Mr. Emery's, he remained ſome hours at Brompton, contemplating what ſteps to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue.

               <p>Juſt as he was preparing to put this reſolution in practice, a boy delivered a letter at the door, addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Barnwell, and which he ſaid had been given him by a man, who directed him to the houſe, and then ran away.</p>

the preceding day, which he gathered from the ſervants, who were packing and cording trunks for a journey. Mr. Emery himſelf had riſen early, and encountered Barnwell in the Hall. There were no traces of uneaſineſs now to be obſerved in his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and Barnwell was not a little ſurpriſed at ſo ſudden a return of his former gaiety.</p>
               <p>"We're going to Ramſgate," ſaid Mr. Emery, "and Mrs. Emery inſiſts upon your accompanying us. Indeed I wiſh it myſelf."</p>
               <p>Barnwell was thunderſtruck—"Ramſgate, Sir!—I really am not prepared. If I might be excuſed—"</p>
               <p>O, by no means; any thing you may have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for can be ſent after you. The plan is arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;—you are to drive Miſs Freeman in the curricle; and there will be three or four other carriages. We breakfaſt early. The carriages are ordered at eleven. You'll be ready.</p>
               <p>Before Barnwell could reply, Mr. Emery was gone; "Ramſgate!" ſaid he to himſelf. "Curricle!—Miſs Freeman! This is ſudden indeed! Juſt at this criſis to be obliged to leave the metropolis!—What can be done?—Even ſhould I acquaint Mental, what could he do towards concealing a tranſaction, that <hi>muſt</hi> come before a public court of juſtice?—His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, at leaſt, may aid me!"</p>
               <p>It was yet but eight o'clock; he determined, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to wait upon Mental immediately. When he arrived at his lodgings, to his infinite concern, he learnt that he had diſcharged them the day before, at a moment's notice; but had left the following note, which was to have been delivered to him that morning.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

She reſides at Ramſgate—I am flying thither in the hope, that ſhe will direct me to the villain, who, if he lives, ſhall feel the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of an injured father; and the death of my Elinor ſhall yet be avenged.

The hope of meeting Mental at Ramſgate, tended to make the journey thither no longer a matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret; and as he flattered himſelf, that his proſecutors would at leaſt acquaint him with their proceedings, he left particular directions to have all letters imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately forwarded to him; and, aſſuming as ſerene a countenance as poſſible, he joined the party in the breakfaſt room, which conſiſted of Mr. and Mrs. Emery, the Miſs Emerys, Miſs Freeman, Lord Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, Mr. Eaſtwood, and Capt. Middleton.</p>
               <p>In ſpite of his efforts to prevent it, the countenance of Barnwell ſpoke a language different to his tongue, and but ill accorded with the vivacity he aſſumed.</p>
               <p>"Knight of the woeful countenance," cried Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte Emery, "whence ſprings thy ſorrow?—"

               <p>"Really, young man," cried Mrs. Emery, "you aſſume a kind of gravity by no means becoming at your age—you poſitively vapour one!"</p>
               <p>"What's the matter, Barnwell?" ſaid Mr. Emery.</p>
               <p>"I believe, 'pon my honor," cried Lord Morley, "that we are too ſevere upon ſo ſuſceptible a youth."</p>
               <p>"Dear me!" cried Charlotte—"only look, Miſs Freeman, how prettily he bluſhes!—Nay, child, I did not tell <hi>you</hi> to bluſh; but, really, there is a very lively ſympathy betwixt you."</p>
               <p>"Suppoſe I were to publiſh the banns of marriage; at once," ſaid Mr. Eaſtwood, "betwixt George Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, of the pariſh of—"</p>
               <p>"I forbid the banns, in the name of one Milwood of Brompton!" interrupted Charlotte.</p>
               <p>Barnwell turned pale, and the tea-cup clattered as he held it in his hand.</p>
               <p>"I have been a ſilent auditor, Sir, of this kind of raillery ſome time," ſaid Maria, addreſſing herſelf to Mr. Emery; "but I now demand <hi>your</hi> interference to check ſuch levity; ſince, it my friend feels no concern for the pain ſhe inflicts on the feelings of others, I can no longer endure the inſults ſhe beſtows upon mine!"</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="unknown:038596_0183_1012A00A59B77348"/>
Charlotte looked grave.</p>
               <p>"O dear! Miſs Freeman," cried two or three at once—"O dear!—really you view the matter too ſeriouſly by half—Conſider it as a joke."</p>
               <p>"You will excuſe me," replied Maria; "but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſo far forget the reſpect due to my character, as to yield it to the amuſement of jeſters! I am ſure my dear Charlotte will acquit me of <hi>unneceſſary</hi> ſeverity in my preſent appeal; and I hope, from this moment, to feel its ſucceſs."</p>
               <p>"Very well, Madam—very well"—cried Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte;—"you may talk <hi>us</hi> down with your notions of propriety, and all that ſort of thing; but you can't prevent grooms and ſtable boys from telling what they ſee and hear to the footmen; and if the footmen ſhould whiſper the chambermaid, and ſhe ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in the valet, and the valet ſhould drop a word or two as he combs my Lord's hair, and then his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip reveals it to me—why have not a right to tell my ſtory again?"</p>
               <p>"What does all this allude to?" ſaid Mr. Emery.</p>
               <p>"You muſt underſtand," ſaid Lord Morley, "that my valet—."</p>
               <p>"Give me leave to tell my own ſtory," interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Charlotte.</p>
               <p>"Only remember, I do not vouch for your <hi>embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments,</hi> Charlotte," replied his Lordſhip.</p>
               <p>"You know, Sir," returned ſhe, "that when we firſt ſaw Mr. Barnwell, we all concluded that the young man had been bred in a monaſtery—he had all that cold ſort of gravity, that monks are ſaid to poſſeſs; and was for ever preaching about virtue, and propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and ſuch things. Who would have ever expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed then, to hear that ſuch a being had actually under his patronage one of the fineſt women in England; of whom he is ſo extremely jealous, that he keeps her locked up in a ſort of citadel at Brompton.—They ſay he employs two eunuchs and an old woman to attend her; and never permits her to approach the window, or walk in the garden, except by moonlight. We were all exceſſively aſtoniſhed at this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;

               <p>"You ſee, Maria, what an incorrigible ſhe is!" ſaid Mr. Emery.</p>
               <p>"It's perfectly amazing to me," ſaid Mr. Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, in a tone of fulſome adulation, "how any one can be otherwiſe than enamoured of ſuch an enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vivacity!"</p>
               <p>"For my part," ſaid Lord Morley, "I think it a moſt enviable talent which Charlotte poſſeſſes, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving a dull ſtory, by throwing in a few <hi>daſhes</hi> of light and ſhade. How intolerably petrifying it is, to be obliged to liſten to the dull matter of fact ſtyle, which ſome people narrate in!"</p>
               <p>"Splendid fiction obtains a preference with your Lordſhip, then, over plain truth," ſaid Maria.</p>
               <p>"Out of all doubt! ſaid his lordſhip.</p>
               <p>Barnwell, glad to put an end to the converſation, ran to the window, and announced the arrival of the carriages. A delay now commenced, by the poſitive refuſal of Maria to aſcend the curricle, and ended not till a conſiderable time was ſpent in forming a new arrangement, which gave the curricle to Lord Morley and Emma Emery, placed Maria in his lordſhip's coach, and delivered Barnwell over to Captain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton's poſt chariot.</p>

               <p>AFTER a journey interrupted by no incident wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of relation, the travellers arrived at a houſe, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for their reception, at Ramſgate.</p>
               <p>

Mrs. Emery and her daughters were delighted with its ſituation, commanding fine views of the ſea in the front, and an extenſive ſweep of country behind; and having no ſingle care upon their ſpirits, they were negatively happy in participating, with others of the firſt order of people, the amuſements of the ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Lord Morley and the <hi>polite Divine</hi> alſo killed their time tolerably to their ſatisfaction, with the aid of bathing rooms, libraries, theatres, raffles, danci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g, ſailing, riding, driving, eating, drinking, and ſleeping.</p>
               <p>Captain Middleton and Mr. Emery had other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupations; they were gameſters in the confidence of each other, the former had been many years of the profeſſion, the other was of later practice.—Mr. Freeman, his godfather and maſter, had married him to his ward, an heireſs, and had given him a ſhare of his concerns.</p>
               <p>Mr. Emery entered life with the faireſt proſpects, and the beſt intentions; but unfortunately connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with courtiers, and by their intereſts with the government itſelf, his vanity defeated his intereſt, and he had injured, moſt deeply, not only his own fortune, but that of his early benefactor. By the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial aid which his court friends afforded him, he was enabled to extend a credit, which imperceptibly, but inevitably, undermined his fortunes; ſince, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn for that credit, a reciprocal accommodation was expected, which could only be yielded by narrowing their capital, whilſt additional credit called for its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement.</p>
               <p>It is matter of peculiar regret, that the only me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods which perſons in Mr. Emery's ſituation can adopt, to retrieve their errors, are preciſely thoſe which are equally likely to render them fatal. Thus, had Mr. Emery poſſeſſed the reſolution to have nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed his concerns, confined his trade, and leſſened his expences, his conſequence in the eyes of the world would have ſunk, his <hi>Court friends</hi> would have vaniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and thoſe whom <hi>he</hi> could no longer ſerve, would at once have withheld their countenance from <hi>him;</hi> and the conſequence is obvious.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="unknown:038596_0186_1012A012F98259E0"/>
In addition to this conſideration, Mr. Emery was naturally vain, and ſhrunk from the idea of a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary degradation. Hope pointed from one ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another, till, in the purſuit of reparation, he found deſtruction; yet, though in ſight, he ſtruggled to conceal it from himſelf: he trembled with horror at the recollection of the wide ruin he had wrought, and, by various methods, ſtrove to murder his own thoughts.</p>
               <p>Middleton was a man, whoſe very heart was bad, and within whoſe breaſt the voice of Conſcience had long been ſtifled. The neceſſities of Emery made him the dupe of this wretch, who, by pretending to initiate him in the mean arts of gaming, only ſecured him the more eaſily his prey.</p>
               <p>The amiable Maria carried with her to Ramſgate a ſilent ſorrow, and concealed affection which preyed upon her health and ſpirits; and caſt a gloom over thoſe ſcenes that enchanted others.</p>
               <p>Barnwell, the unhappy Barnwell, was the prey of the moſt afflicting remorſe, and tormenting uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.</p>
               <p>Such were the party, who by the ſplendor of their eſtabliſhment, attracted the admiration of the rich, and the envy of the poor; <hi>that poor,</hi> who would often exchange their envy for pity, if, through the dazzling exterior of grandeur, they could view ſuch hearts as Emery's.</p>
               <p>Two or three days elapſed, and brought no ſucceſs to Barnwell's ſearch after Mental. He inquired minutely, and ſought diligently, but to no purpoſe. Nor had he received any intelligence from London. The fourth day, as he was returning from a walk, his attention was drawn to the ſea ſhore, by the arrival of the hoy; and he ſtood ſome time contemplating the motley crew as they diſembarked.</p>
               <p>Among a variety of ſtrange figures, he particularly noticed a tall, thin man, dreſſed in a ſlovenly manner, in a ſhabby ſuit of black, who, the moment he land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſeated himſelf on a firkin of butter; and, pulling
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:038596_0187_1012A0170F1CED50"/>
out his pocket-book and pencil, began ſcribbling, and exclaimed aloud—</p>
               <p>"Dam'me, that'll do—freſh water ſailing—the Sprightly Kitty—Batterſea Bridge—Chelſea Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Works—Splaſh—Spaniſh—Keep moving—Puſh on—What's to pay?—that's your ſort—It'll do, dam'me!"</p>
               <p>Every body ſtared with aſtoniſhment.</p>
               <p>"Who is that gentleman, pray?" ſaid Barnwell to another paſſenger, who ſtood near him.</p>
               <p>"Hum!" cried the ſtranger—"Only notice him!"</p>
               <p>In a minute the other ſtarted from the butter-tub, and ſet off a ſcamper, exclaiming, as he ran by Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well—"Dam'me, I've every thing but a plot!"</p>
               <p>"Sir," ſaid the ſtranger to Barnwell, "that's one of the firſt dramati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Next ſeaſon!" replied Barnwell: "he muſt be a quick hand, then, at theſe matters."</p>
               <p>"O, Sir, he'll turn you out two in a winter; and one ſhall be equally as good as the other. But, pray, Sir, may I aſk if you can direct me to a Mr. Emery's reſidence here?"</p>
               <p>The ſmile which hovered on the lips of Barnwell, at the eccentricity of the dramatiſt, fled in an inſtant; he trembled as he anſwered the inquiry, and was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to aſk the man his buſineſs there, much as he wiſhed to learn it.</p>
               <p>"Perhaps you may know the perſon I want to ſee,' cried the man:—"its a Mr. Barnwell."</p>
               <p>"Fortunate enough," ſaid Barnwell, with a look ill according with the ſentence:—"My name is Barnwell. I reſide with Mr. Emery."</p>
               <p>"You, Sir!—Is it poſſible?—If you are the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I want, you know a lady of the name of—."</p>
               <p>"Milwood," interrupted Barnwell—Is it not ſo?"</p>
               <p>"The ſame, indeed," replied the man.</p>
               <p>"Tell me, then, inſtantly, your buſineſs—have
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:038596_0188_1012A018A141F638"/>
you any letters from her—any meſſage—any—"</p>
               <p>The man retired ſome paces from Barnwell, and looking him full in the face—"Any meſſage from <hi>her!</hi>—Pray, Sir, what do you take me for?—No, Sir; you miſtake the perſon you have to deal with, I aſſure you. I come, Sir, from the injured huſband, from the enraged uncle, of that unfortunate woman—and I come, Sir, upon moſt ſerious buſineſs—but this is not a proper place for ſuch converſation as we muſt enter into."</p>
               <p>They retired to—'s Hotel.—When they were ſeated, and alone, the ſtranger, pulling off his hat and ſtroaking his chin with an air of vaſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, began, in a pompous tone of voice—"My name, Sir, is Blackmore—Nehemiah Blackmore, of Hatton-Garden; a name not altogether new, I flatter myſelf, to the ears of the world.

               <p>Barnwell too deeply felt the truth of theſe ill-timed obſervations—"Certainly—Yes—true—" replied he; but to your buſineſs, Sir."</p>
               <p>"Why, Sir, you are young, I perceive, and new to the world, or it would not be neceſſary to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you are extremely fortunate in having fallen into ſuch hands as Nehemiah Blackmore, of Harton Garden; whoſe character is that of a peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker.—Upwards of a thouſand law ſuits have been prevented by your humble ſervant; though I would not, for the world, have it known, as I ſhould certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be kicked out of the profeſſion."</p>
               <p>"Still, Sir," ſaid Barnwell, "you wander from the ſubject—I deſire to know your inſtructions."</p>
               <p>"As to my inſtructions, they were to proceed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately againſt you, to recover damages <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"In ſhort, then, Sir—being ordered to proſecute, I reflected upon the certain conſequences of ſuch a meaſure, which always expoſes both parties, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſixes three or four heads in a ſixpenny maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine—."</p>
               <p>"For heaven's ſake, man ſpeak to the purpoſe," cried Barnwell, ſtarting from his chair, and walking about the room—"ſpare yourſelf this needleſs pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to your demands—Say honeſtly, at once, that the wretch who married this lady, is willing to heal his wounded honor with gold; and that, if I will give it him without the mandate of the law, he will accept it—Is it not ſo?"</p>

               <p>TWO days more elapſed without affording Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well any intelligence of Mental; and he concluded, that, having accompliſhed the purpoſe of his journey, he had returned to town. The mind of Barnwell, in the mean time, was ſuffering the ſevereſt pains of which its nature was ſuſceptible. In addition to the acuteneſs of his own feelings, the letters of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:038596_0191_1012A02177591CF8"/>
and Eliza inflicted agonizing wounds upon his heart. The ſtate of his mind became more and more evident to obſervers; and from an object of ridicule, he had become the ſubject of pity, even with the volatile Charlotte herſelf.</p>
               <p>But the utmoſt powers of language are inadequate to deſcribe the conflict of contending influences in the boſom of the amiable Maria. Pity was a nurſling which ſhe had foſtered there from the firſt moment ſhe was capable of receiving impreſſions. Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was the inſtinct of Maria—and to diſpenſe around her comfort and peace, was the buſineſs of her hands, and the object of her thoughts.—When the merits of Barnwell had kindled in her heart a new and ſtrong emotion, ſhe had cheriſhed it without the remoteſt apprehenſion of danger. When ſhe diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered that virtuous ſympathies, and congenial taſtes, imperceptibly had wrought a paſſion in her breaſt, ſhe ſtarted not with ſhame—ſhe examined the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her admiration in every point of view, and found him worthy; while the ſimilarity of their diſpoſitions and purſuits, drew from Barnwell an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, which Hope had painted to her mind in the colours moſt agreeable to her wiſhes. It was not, therefore, till the quick echo of ſcandal had vibrated to her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar ſtories to the prejudice of his moral character, that the breaſt of Maria ever felt a pang. But when his ſubſequent behaviour ſanctioned the ſurmiſes formed upon report; when ſhe beheld his former openneſs of countenance changed into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted brow, and a timid eye; when ſhe ſaw his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer polite attentions converted into the moſt ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timed abſences of mind—his occaſional ſtarts—his abrupt ſighs—and various other ſymptoms, that too plainly ſay—"My heart is not at eaſe!—" then was Maria miſerable indeed! She felt his ſorrows, and would have healed them by the ſacrifice of all that was deareſt to her in exiſtence.</p>
               <p>As ſhe purſued this train of thought, however, and traced the ſuppoſed cauſe of his inquietudes to Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:038596_0192_1012A024528EE678"/>
pity for his ſufferings became diminiſhed, by a jealous apprehenſion, which ſhe found it impoſſible to conquer. In vain ſhe reproved the ſelfiſhneſs of her feelings: ſhe found, that the heart will act as a free agent; and often, very often, againſt the cool, diſſuading admonitions of the judgment.</p>
               <p>That heart ſtill cheriſhed for Barnwell the glow of love; and, in ſpite of her efforts to diſſemble, the effects of that love were conſpicuous in many of her actions.</p>
               <p>The whole of the party, except Barnwell, being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged on a ſailing trip, to viſit the fleet, then anchor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Roads, he had ſpent great part of the day in writing letters for Mr. Emery; when, towards evening, a perſon inquired for him, who would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part his errand to himſelf only. He had the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a fiſherman, and, upon being introduced to Barnwell, delivered the following letter—</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>"If it be poſſible, let me entreat you will accompany the bearer immediately, who will conduct you in five minutes to</p>

                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>Without a moment's deliberation Barnwell follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his guide. At a ſmall detached hut, near the ſea ſide, the fiſherman halted. A clean, neat, elderly woman ſat at the door, mending nets, and four or five children were playing before her—</p>
               <p>"This is my bit of place, pleaſe your honor; and there is a grand lady within, who gave me that letter for your honor."</p>
               <p>Barnwell entered, and diſcovered Milwood, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly attired in a travelling dreſs. The fiſherman retired to the outſide of the hut, and they were left alone.</p>
               <p>"How came you hither?" cried Barnwell. "Where is your uncle?"—</p>
               <p>There was a wild horror in her looks—ſhe fixed
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:038596_0193_1012A02726378608"/>
her eyes on him, graſped him by the hand, and made no reply to his queſtions. She conducted him in this manner, through the fiſherman's garden, to an aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue that led direct to the cliffs.—Barnwell began to tremble for her intellects, ſo well ſhe feigned the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of confirmed Deſpair. When they had aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a ſtupendous height, ſhe approached the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the cliff that overhung an inlet of the ſea, whoſe billows tumbled at its baſe with an awful roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>"Here, Barnwell, we muſt pauſe," ſaid ſhe, in a tone of voice expreſſive of the firmeſt reſolution—"we are alone—unheard—unſeen by mortal!"—then fixing her eyes on the ſetting ſun—"Witneſs for me, thou glorious orb, deſcending now beneath the expanſe of waters—If theſe eyes for the <hi>laſt time</hi> are fixed on thee, O, bear me witneſs, in the chancery of Heaven—here ſtands my murderer!"</p>
               <p>Barnwell ſtarted!—</p>
               <p>"The agitation of the mind," continued ſhe, "conſequent on an adventure like that which ſevered us, ſo rudely, from each other, is now over, Sir. There exiſts no more within this boſom, doubts and deſires, contending for empire:—the conflict is deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. I am free from the controul both of my uncle, and the being, who imagined that the mummery of a ceremony could conſign my heart to his poſſeſſion. They have both ſworn never to ſee me more."</p>
               <p>"Indeed!" exclaimed Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied ſhe; "but you, Sir, they mean to purſue with all the vengeance with which the law inveſts them.—It ſeems you have thought fit to reject their overtures to compromiſe, and have deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined rather to ſuffer a ridiculous exhibition of yourſelf and me, than part, a little ſooner than you muſt, with a few filthy counters!"</p>
               <p>Barnwell was amazed!</p>
               <p>"It would be abſurd, through a falſe delicacy, to ſpeak leſs to the purpoſe, Sir.—We are not now mingled with the ſubjects of prejudice and forms, in
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:038596_0194_1012A02BA6D50A40"/>
what is termed ſociety. You and I are, upon this ſpot, <hi>ourſelves alone;</hi> and the expreſſion of our feelings to each other need ſuffer no reſtraint. All that we view around us, at preſent, is the work of nature, ſave theſe artificial habiliments that deck our perſons.—Be ours, then, the language of nature. For myſelf, I am determined to ſpeak no other. Thus, then, ſays my heart—that it will exiſt upon no other terms, than the poſſeſſion of your love. Say, then, Barnwell—Do you bid me ſtill enjoy the cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful rays of life—or ſhall I quickly ſeek the ſhades of everlaſting night?"</p>
               <p>"How wildly you converſe!" ſaid Barnwell:—"ſurely your reaſon, Milwood—"</p>
               <p>—"Has thrown off the fetters that controuled it," interrupted ſhe. "The true end of reaſon is to lead us to happineſs. Two paths are opened to me, and one of them is—Death!—Surely that trembling is feigned, Sir—or you would not heſitate to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a cataſtrophe which ſo ſeriouſly affected you."</p>
               <p>"How prevent it, Milwood?"</p>
               <p>"By acceding to the propoſitions offered you."</p>
               <p>"It is impoſſible!"</p>
               <p>"Nothing more eaſy:—your bond for the greater part would be accepted; and, ſurely, three or four hundred might be raiſed immediately. <hi>I</hi> have ſome baubles, which I ſhould deem well diſpoſed of in procuring your peace of mind. But, Barnwell, there is a deliberate coolneſs, too evident to be overlooked, that tells me, 'tis your wiſh, that the affair ſhould burſt upon the public ear. I muſt have been miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in you, Sir, when I thought otherwiſe. But, mark me, while I ſwear, in the hallowed preſence of Omniſcience!" (and ſhe knelt) "not beyond the limits of another day will Milwood live, if you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in a refuſal of the terms!"</p>
               <p>"Hold, hold—for heaven's ſake, retract!" cried Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"'Twas not raſhly ſworn, and ſhall be ſacredly obſerved," ſaid ſhe, riſing with a firm, majeſtic air.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="unknown:038596_0195_1012A02D37C90D38"/>
The ſoul of Barnwell was tortured with ſevereſt conflicts. He could not gaze upon her form without a love, that equalled adoration. His own heart, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>void of guile, ſuſpected not deceit in her. He conceived he ſaw before him, miſery and deſpair of his own creation; and his countenance proclaimed to Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, that the moment proper for the attack was come.</p>
               <p>Somewhat ſoftening her voice and her manner, ſhe preſſed his hand—"Could I have ever thought <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"O, hold!—My wife—my guide—my fate—lead, direct, controul me, as thou wilt!—Live, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood; live, on any terms you pleaſe."</p>
               <p>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>With matchleſs art ſhe guarded againſt this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow of his affection; and cautiouſly reflecting upon her ſituation—"Nay, Barnwell," cried ſhe, "add not this cruel pity to my ſufferings! If it is reſolved, that I muſt die, in mercy do not ſhake my reſolution, by the thought that you would feel a pang, when I am dead!"</p>
               <p>"Talk not of death," ſaid Barnwell. "Do I not ſay, that I will ſign the bond?—Ay," continued he, wildly, "though ſure deſtruction were the penalty. Come, then, let us ſeek this Blackmore."</p>
               <p>"O, Barnwell, how has this tenderneſs altered all my thoughts. No; you ſhall <hi>not</hi> ſign this bond; at leaſt not at preſent. Here are ſome jewels of my mother's; take them; they have been valued at ſix hundred pounds. You can diſpatch ſome confiden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial perſon to London, who may diſpoſe of them. But, in the mean time, it is abſolutely neceſſary, ſo well I know the wretch's mercenary ſpirit, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure three hundred pounds this night.

                  </gap> you could borrow ſo much till the jewels are diſpoſed of—"</p>
               <p>"O, with eaſe," cried the poor victim. "I have always more than that of Mr. Emery's in my poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and I am ſure he will oblige me."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="unknown:038596_0196_1012A0301A7C1338"/>
"And yet," ſaid Milwood, "would it not lead to a variety of queſtions, and conjectures, if you were to aſk him? As it will be but, at fartheſt, for a few days, could you not without his knowledge—"</p>
               <p>Barnwell ſtarted—"What! <hi>ſteal</hi> it, do you mean?"</p>
               <p>"If you <hi>muſt</hi> put ſo harſh a conſtruction on my meaning, why, call it <hi>ſtealing.</hi> I conceive, merely to borrow from an idle fund, for ſo ſhort a time, and with ſuch ſecurity for the repayment, differs eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially from <hi>ſtealing;</hi>—but uſe your own diſcretion. I merely hinted the objection, from the motive of deſiring to ſave you pain; ſince you muſt either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs our connection too abruptly, (which would be conveyed to your Eliza, and your mother) or evade it by a falſehood—a meaner vice, in my eſtimation, than even <hi>ſtealing!</hi>"</p>
               <p>This ſophiſtry was a ſtumbling block to Barnwell. He ſighed—he inwardly lamented the alternative to which he was reduced, but was ſilent. They now walked towards the fiſherman's hut.—Milwood de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited the jewels in his hands, which Barnwell ſaid he would not ſell, but pledge for the ſum immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly required, and would ſoon redeem them. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to return to the hut in half an hour, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.</p>
               <p>He entered the reſidence of Mr. Emery—he open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his bureau—his hands trembled—he counted out three hundred pounds in bank notes. In wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his name on one of them, a tear fell, and blotted it;—it ſurpriſed him:—"Why do I weep?" ſaid he—"Childiſh weakneſs!"</p>
               <p>As he returned through the town he kept his eyes fixed on the ground; he imagined every paſſenger looked ſuſpiciouſly upon him. When he entered the room, Milwood received him with open arms. He breathed hard—his countenance was pale, and his knees tottered.</p>
               <p>"You are unwell, my Barnwell," ſaid <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e.</p>
               <p>"A little ſick—It will be over ſoon."</p>

                  <pb n="198" facs="unknown:038596_0197_1012A031ADBFAB80"/>
"If this is the conſequence of your effort to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me, Barnwell, rather let me periſh than exiſt upon your miſery.—Go—replace theſe notes—and be happy!"</p>
               <p>"Milwood—it is not eaſy to vanquiſh thoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſts of virtue, which have long repelled within my boſom the approach of a <hi>mean</hi> thought. A reverence of honour is the ſtrong guard of virtue. I have bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down the trenches of ſelf-approbation, by the commiſſion of a mean, if not a vicious act!—But it is done—and—I ſhall—I hope—ſoon forget it!"</p>
               <p>"Indeed—indeed, my Barnwell you think too ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly. Had you even committed a robbery, you could not have diſcovered more remorſe. Surely, there is ſomething like weakneſs in yielding to theſe vapouriſh impreſſions."</p>
               <p>"It <hi>may</hi> be weakneſs—but—"</p>
               <p>"Come, come, no more of this—I have another ſubject now for your attention. Do you obſerve a little cottage at the foot of yon aſcent that winds up to the cliffs? I have engaged a ſmall but neat apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment there, for a few days. Shall I have your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation?—Come, 'tis but a few minutes walk.</p>
               <p>There was a magic ſurrounded this woman, which Barnwell had long found omnipotent. He was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed upon entering the cottage to find it moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly, though ſimply, furniſhed. The evening was warm—Milwood conducted him to an alcove in the garden, that commanded a near view of the ſea. A gentle breeze floated melodiouſly on the ſurface of the ocean; the moon's image was reflected in the deep, and her ſilver beams ſhed an undazzling ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor on the ſurrounding ſcenery. The ſoothing ſilence of the hour was uninterrupted; ſave, now and then, the nightingale ſent forth her ſoft and ſweeteſt notes; or the daſhing of diſtant oars murmured melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly on their ears.</p>
               <p>A repaſt of fruit and home-made wine furniſhed the table; whilſt Milwood, by every artifice in her power, eſſayed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The ſenſibility of Barnwell's ſoul was exquiſite, and in ſome fatal moments gave paſſion a ſuperiority over principle. 'Twas thus that, in the enchanting careſſes of this beautiful woman, he forget all other exiſtence. Rapture ſucceeded to bliſs, and his whole ſoul yielded to the ecſtacies of love!</p>
               <p>An hour or two had paſſed away in theſe endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which Milwood artfully mingled with ſhort accounts of her releaſe from her uncle and huſband, and her vows of future fidelity to him. Still ſhe hinted the <hi>neceſſity</hi> of a <hi>little</hi> longer concealment of their connection from his friends; well aware that the whole force of her enchantment reſted on that point—one breath of ſuſpicion would have ruined all her deep-laid ſchemes, and one effort of his friends would have releaſed her victim from the ſacrifice, to which her moſt infamous arts had doomed him.</p>
               <p>There cannot be a more dangerous ſituation for youth, than that which, <hi>from any motive,</hi> induces them to withdraw a confidence in thoſe, who by experience, intereſt, and affection, are <hi>always beſt,</hi> and <hi>often ſolely,</hi> qualified to adviſe them.</p>
               <p>It was nearly midnight, and of courſe too late to return to Mr. Emery's; but this occaſioned him no uneaſineſs, as from the irregular mode of living at watering places, the individuals of the family ſeldom ſaw each other, except at dinner.</p>
               <p>As they were about to retire, a little ſail, which had hovered in ſight for ſome time, made the ſhore immediately under the alcove. Two perſons landed, one of whom, muffled up in a black cloak, ſaid to his companion, in a voice which Barnwell inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized as Mental's—"We muſt, if poſſible, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a lodging at the hotel to-night; or if not, a ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble among the cliffs and rocks will occupy the time till morning."</p>
               <p>"Ay, maſter," ſaid the other; "but I'd rather be comfortably tumbling about on a ſoft feather bed, than be climbing hard rocks by moon-light."</p>
               <p>"<hi>You</hi> might," ſaid Mental; "but think you now,
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:038596_0199_1012A03A17ECC568"/>
that the villain who ſeduced, and then abandoned, my poor child, and who with juſtice may be deemed her murderer, <hi>ſleeps undiſturbed</hi> upon his bed of down? Alas! there is a difference in the moulding of the human heart, if it be ſo. <hi>I,</hi> who am innocent by compariſon, ſleep not without ſuch dreams of horror, as chill the blood to think upon."</p>
               <p>They then wandered out of hearing.</p>

               <p>THE certainty of Mental's being at Ramſgate, was ſome ſlender relief to the agitated mind of Barnwell. The next morning, therefore, he buſied himſelf in inquiries, and at length diſcovered his reſidence. The whole of that day, however, Mental was from home, and Barnwell merely left his addreſs.</p>
               <p>The houſe and family of Mr. Emery grew hateful to his ſight; his own reflections were intolerable;
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:038596_0200_1012A03BA99A5078"/>
and the only reſource left him, was the ſociety of Milwood. This conſummate miſtreſs of hypocriſy now amuſed him with the relation of a new tale, of the manner in which ſhe had diſpoſed of the three hundred pounds. Mr. <hi>Nehemiah Blackmore,</hi> of <hi>Hatton Garden,</hi> was once more brought to figure in the ſcene. He produced a fictitious releaſe from the pretended huſband of Milwood, and a bond for five hundred pounds, payable to himſelf, with intereſt, at the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of three months.—The artifices of this man (who was, perhaps, one of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>He now conſidered Milwood as his wife, and was only reſtrained by her entreaties, for <hi>yet a little more delay,</hi> from acquainting this parent and his ſiſter with his ſituation. He was determined to confide imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in Mental, and went early the next morning to his lodgings.</p>
               <p>Soon as that extraordinary man obſerved Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, he ran to him, and ſhaking him by the hand—"I have diſcovered him!" ſaid he:—"the monſter ſhall not eſcape the vengeance due to his enormous crimes. I will be revenged—a daughter's ſhame—a daughter's death, muſt be avenged—Middleton, or Mental, dies.</p>
               <p>"Middleton!" exclaimed Barnwell<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </p>
               <p>"Ay!" cried Mental, "Middleton—Captain Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton—the friend, the intimate, the familiar, of your Emery—He it was who deſtroyed the innocence a father had abandoned!"</p>
               <p>"Aſtoniſhing!" exclaimed Barnwell.—"Have you ever ſeen the Captain?"</p>
               <p>"Never," ſaid Mental: "but I have learnt his character—which is a blot upon the name of man! Mark how accidentally I diſcovered the betrayer. The diſtreſſing ſcene of my poor daughters death ſo faſtened its reflection on my mind, that my waking

Thus haunted by the wretchedneſs of my fellow creatures, I began to contemplate how far my own abilities might leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen or alleviate their ſufferings, I ſhuddered to reflect, how large a portion of time I had devoted to una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing ſorrows and remorſe; and how uſeleſs, had remained the property I poſſeſſed.

               <p>"In the priſon, which is called the Fleet, there are ranges of little rooms on the ground floor, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling cells. I had viſited ſeveral of them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with their ſad inhabitants; I ſay ſad, becauſe there is a <hi>merry</hi> claſs of priſoners, who tenant the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per rooms, and are generally young men of family, who take the method of confinement, merely to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort the price of their releaſe from their friends; or they are villains, who riot there, in complete ſafety,

upon the ſpoils of ruined families. Thus the upper apartments frequently reſemble the galleries of an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, where waiters are groaning beneath the weight of wines and tavern dainties; whilſt the lower range more generally aſſumes the appearance of an ill-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided lazar-houſe. 'Tis to one of theſe rooms that I am now going to introduce you.</p>
               <p>"Figure to yourſelf a ſtone arched roof receſs, about ten feet ſquare, which contained a bed, a table, two or three chairs, ſome boxes, and five inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. One was an aged man, bald and blind:—he ſat in an armed chair by the fire; one of his arms was wrapped in flannel, being paralytic; whilſt with the other hand he kept conſtantly feeling his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daughter, a girl of about nineteen, with an intelligent countenance, but pale and ſickly from confinement, who was reading to him. His ſon appeared rather more than forty, and was employed at a preſs, in one corner of the room, in cutting ſmooth the edges of ſome pamphlets, which his wife was ſtitching. A little boy of ſix years old, who was in bed, ſick with the ſmall-pox, made up the group.</p>
               <p>"When my conductor introduced me, as a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who had been relieving ſeveral of the priſoners, and who was deſirous of knowing the particulars of their debts, the old blind grand-father graſped tightly his grand-daughter's arm, and drew her nearer to him. The woman roſe, and curtſied; but the man kept on working, without beſtowing the leaſt notice upon his intruder. "Who is the gentleman?" ſaid the old man. One, ſaid I, whoſe name is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtrange to you, but who, poſſeſſing the power to ſoften ſorrow, has taken the liberty to intrude on yours.</p>
               <p>"The old man ſighed. The poor woman looked as if ſhe wiſhed to welcome me; but her huſband, ſtill with his back towards me, called to her, in a rough tone, to ſit down, and go on with her work—"Haven't you been duped enough with <hi>flummery</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready?" cried he. "Co on—go on, do—Get theſe

home—let my father have a dinner to day, for God's ſake!" "Nay, nay, Ned," cried the old man, "don't be croſs now—but give a civil anſwer to the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. Is it a young gentleman, Patty?" [to his grand-daughter.] "No, grand-father," ſaid Patty. "Speak to him, Ned," ſaid the old man. "I've nothing to ſay," ſaid his ſon, "that it concerns him to hear."</p>
               <p>"Have you no wants, my friend?" ſaid I. "Would you not be happy to be able to render your father and your family more comfortable than they are?" "That's no concern of yours," replied he: "I la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour from morning to night, and they exiſt by the fruits of it—But, come, Kate—" [to his wife]—"What do you ſnivel at?—The brat will be waking ſoon, and you'll not get theſe finiſhed. What buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has that fellow to bring people here to ſtare at me?—Come—quick—quick—I ſtand ſtill."</p>
               <p>"Struck with the uncommon behaviour of this man, I became more curious to learn his hiſtory, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as he diſcovered leſs inclination to reveal it. I therefore addreſſed myſelf to the old man:—Your ſon, Sir, ſaid I, appears to me to have ſuffered ſo much from falſe profeſſions of benevolence, as to have made him ſpurn with indignation, all pretenſions of that nature. "Alack-a-day! good Sir, whoever you be, I am ſure you deſerve better treatment:—but my poor Ned!—" "Hold your tongue, father," cried the ſon.</p>
               <p>"I could no longer refrain—I approached him, and laying my hand upon his ſhoulder—Friend, ſaid I, you miſtake my character: I come not to wound your honeſt and praiſe-worthy pride—I honor inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of ſpirit—I am myſelf, alſo, a ſufferer by the falſe colours with which men paint themſelves. My heart is not whole, but my purſe is heavy—too heavy for an individual. I have no proſpect of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs before me, but in rendering ſervice where me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit demands it. Then, taking his hand—Let me, my friend, ſerve you. I ſee your heart—I <hi>feel</hi> your

                  <hi>feelings</hi>—Come—come—truſt me—I am no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver.</p>
               <p>"The man looked ſtedfaſtly in my face—I never beheld ſo harſh a ſet of features—His countenance was almoſt ſavage. After he had ſtared at me a few minutes—"You may mean very well," ſaid he:—"'tis poſſible your intentions may be good—But go, Sir, go—we are a miſerable family, and too far ſunk in wretchedneſs for any reſcue but death!—Don't hinder us, then—but go." Juſt then a man tapped at the door, and entered. "Who's that?" exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the grandfather, again drawing his lovely charge nearer to him. "Its lawyer Blackmore, father," ſaid the woman.</p>
               <p>At the name of Blackmore, Barnwell ſtarted.—"Blackmore! did you ſay, Sir?" cried he.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Mental, "Do you know ſuch a perſon?"</p>
               <p>"I—I—have heard of him," ſaid Barnwell, glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with confuſion.</p>
               <p>"Well," continued Mental, "this Blackmore en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and with a ſupercilious air approached towards the old man—"Once more, Mr. Norris," ſaid he, "I am come with offers of clemency to your ſon. My client by no means wiſhes to detain him here; it is far from his intention; it is by no means his wiſh; he don't deſire it; it is far from pleaſant to him; and I hope, therefore, you have prevailed upon him to—." "Wicked, wicked man!" cried the grandfather;—"you ſhare in the guilt of this tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, by becoming the bearer of ſuch propoſals!"</p>
               <p>"Leſs calm was his ſon. Quitting his work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſeized the lawyer by the ſhoulders, and thruſting <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"Whilſt he was out of the room, his wife came to me—"O, God bleſs you for your goodneſs! I

hope you will excuſe my poor huſband; but his brain is almoſt turned, Sir, by bad uſage. I wiſh I could tell you our ſtory; but he is grown ſo wild, we dare not contradict him. O, he is ſo altered!—There was not a kinder creature living, a more tender and affectionate huſband or father, till that bad man, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Middleton—."</p>
               <p>"Here the huſband returned, and the poor wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with evident ſymptoms of fear, went to her work.</p>
               <p>"Son, ſon," ſaid the old man, "I charge thee, let this kind gentleman know our ſtory. Come, now, I pray, do. I am ſure he is a good-hearted gentleman, and will ſerve thee."</p>
               <p>"Poor old man!" ſaid his ſon; "and you my dear girl [to his daughter;] my little boy too; and you Kate [to his wife,] I feel for you all! But, pſha, what but pain reſults from feeling! I will not yield to tenderneſs—Come, come, to work, to work, I pray you, Sir, to leave us."</p>
               <p>"Here there was a violent burſt of laughter in the court yard, juſt within hearing. Not far from the window, a party of young fellows were playing with ſome of their miſtreſſes, and their mirth was as loud as obſcene.</p>
               <p>"Daughter," cried the younger Norris, "ſtop your ears—Leave the room."</p>

                  </gap> for your compaſſion!—That venerable old man, my father, about ſixty years ago, entered into buſineſs in the city of Canterbury. I was his only
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:038596_0206_1012A04CD9B47990"/>
child; I learnt his art, that of bookbinder and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. My mother died—I married; and as my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declined in years, I conducted our concerns. Nineteen years of time had paſſed ſince my marriage, when there came to be quartered in our city, a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of militia. We kept a library, and of courſe our ſhop became a ſort of lounge for the ladies of Canterbury. The officers of the regiment ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered this, and peſtered us with their company. My girl, there, though now pale and ſickly-looking, was then as fair a wench as any in all Canterbury. Her beauty obtained her many fulſome flatteries, of which we endeavoured to ſhew her the inſignificant value; and I believe the girl had ſenſe enough to treat them for the moſt part, with juſt that civil indifference they deſerved:—but there was one ſcoundrel—a handſome fellow, too—a captain in the regiment, who made a a more than ordinary impreſſion upon my poor girl's heart. His attachment was evident; his attentions too conſpicuous to be overlooked; but his purpoſes, his infernal purpoſes, he well concealed. Under the maſk of kindneſs for me, and my family, he held out a bait, which my active and induſtrious ſpirit too eagerly graſped at. About that time a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarian at Margate failed; the ſhop and buſineſs were to be diſpoſed of; and having obtained, by his frequent viſits, a moſt familiar footing in our family, Captain Middleton, after a proper introduction, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lend me a ſum ſufficient to purchaſe them, upon the joint bond of my father and myſelf; with the ſimple condition, that an elderly lady, his friend, ſhould board and lodge there. Unfortunately we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his treacherous offer; we completed the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe; and my father, being indiſpoſed, and having gradully loſt his ſight, removed to Margate, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by my daughter.</p>
               <p>"'Twas not long ere the real purpoſe of this ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generoſity was expoſed, by the following accident:—Captain Middleton frequently rode from Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury to Margate, and never failed paying his reſpects
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:038596_0207_1012A050F3526D80"/>
to the old lady, whom he ſettled in our houſe. I myſelf, having to ſuperintend the buſineſs both at Canterbury and Margate, alſo had frequent occaſions to be there. It happened, that, one evening as I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed round the garden at the back of the houſe, I heard the voice of Captain Middleton, loudly diſputing in a ſummer houſe with Mrs. Maſters, the old lady; and as I paſſed the door, which was ſhut, I heard him diſtinctly utter—'My God, Madam, I am trifled with:—do you imagine I have been paying three hundred pounds for mere <hi>gape ſeed!</hi> I tell you, the ſtay of the regiment at Canterbury is uncertain; and I am determined to poſſeſs this jewel before I quit Kent.' 'I ſay, Sir,' replied the old Beldame, 'that your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience will ruin every thing. The girl loves you, I am certain; but ſhe has been ſtrictly educated, and her notions of virtue are not to be overcome ſo eaſily as we conquered Elinor Mental's.'</p>
               <p>"Judge," ſaid Mental to Barnwell at this part of his narrative, "how I felt at that name, and at the ſubſequent remarks!—I ſtruggled hard; and, in part, concealed my emotion, as I longed to hear the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the tale.</p>
               <p>"Preſuming," ſaid Norris, upon what I heard, how much I was intereſted in their diſcourſe, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to liſten. 'Ay,' cried Middleton, 'that affair was well managed:—to the laſt hour of my life, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maſters, I ſhall be indebted to you for that bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; but here you boggle curſedly; and yet this chit has not half the cunning of the jilt Mental.' 'True' replied the other; 'but there is ſo much more virtue and <hi>fuſs</hi> in the way than there was with Mental. Beſides, here are a father and mother; Mental was the caſt-away charge of a neglectful boarding ſchool governeſs.—I repeat, Sir, you muſt have patience, or you will ſpoil all.' Here their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation broke off; but I had heard enough to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a fire in my veins. I am by nature warm, and impatient of inſult;—burſting open the door, I ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the villain, and exhauſted my rage in curſes on
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:038596_0208_1012A0528796C3A8"/>
his head. Guilt made him coward—He ſubmitted tamely to my anger.—The woman left the arbour, and in a few hours the houſe. In vain he attempted to palliate his intentions. I was deaf to every thing he ſaid. I continued roughly to handle him, and never relinquiſhed my hold, till I had kicked him complete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of doors.</p>
               <p>"Every hour ſince that, the mean and cowardly villain has been planning the ruin of my family. His firſt ſtep was, to put the bond he held, immediately in execution againſt me; and, as a fit engine for his infernal purpoſe, he choſe the man you have juſt now ſeen as a lawyer. If you know any thing of law, you need not be told, Sir, that, in the hands of wicked men, it may be eaſily made the deſtruction of poor debtors.</p>
               <p>"My buſineſs was neglected, in the attendance neceſſary to carry on a fruitleſs defence againſt his extortions; my little capital was exhauſted; my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſes were ſold; my cuſtomers forſook me; my real creditors flocked about me; my effects were ſeized, and ſold. But the aim of this vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain was revenge; he therefore preferred ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my perſon; and having hunted me from one part of the kingdom to another, for ſome months, he has at length ſucceeded to the utmoſt of his malicious wiſh. My poor, infirm parent will not quit me, but prefers this dungeon to a workhouſe. My daughter he will not truſt a minute from him, being tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with the notion that Middleton will will yet ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her.</p>
               <p>"I have had friends, falſe ſummer friends, whom now I never ſee. Judge then, Sir, if there is not ſome excuſe for my ferocious diſpoſition. I am like a hunted beaſt taken in the toils; and have loſt all hope in heaven, all confidence in man.

had reſolved upon my conduct; and contriving to ſlip my purſe into Mrs. Norris's hand, unobſerved by her huſband, I took my leave of theſe victims of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous power. The neceſſary directions for their liberation were given; and I arrived at Ramſgate in time to hear from the lips of the dying wretch, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the horrible tale of my Elinor's deſtruction. I obtained the addreſs of Middleton, which was in London. I returned thither the next day, and traced him to Emery's, in Portland Place, where I learnt, that he had accompanied the family hither.</p>
               <p>"After ſpending ſome time in a neceſſary attention to Norris's family, which will ſoon be at liberty, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to Margate, and from hence in a little fiſhing boat to this place."</p>
               <p>"What an extraordinary diſcovery!' ſaid Barnwell, when Mental concluded.</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied Mental; "and I am determined to act deciſively upon it.—Where is Emery's houſe?—I'll ſee this Middleton to-day."</p>
               <p>"I will conduct you, if you pleaſe," ſaid Barnwell. "But, before we go, if you could beſtow an hour's attention upon a circumſtance, that involves in its conſequences my future deſtiny—."</p>
               <p>"That Milwood, you allude to.—I have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, amidſt my own concerns, your danger, youth! Nor, believe me, am I indifferent to your welfare. If you will unburden your breaſt of its anxieties, you ſhall experience from me all that a fond parent is deſirous of beſtowing on his ſon."</p>
               <p>Barnwell related every occurrence that had taken place ſince his connection with Milwood.</p>

               <p>WHEN Barnwell had concluded his ſtory, having concealed nothing from Mental, but the means by which he obtained the three hundred pounds, the latter fixed his eyes upon the former, and in an affectionate tone of voice—"Beware, youth, beware!" ſaid he. "I ſhall think on your ſtory: in the meantime, lead me to Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton."</p>
               <p>"Upon their arrival at Mr. Emery's, they were ſurpriſed to find the whole houſe in confuſion. Maria Freeman, whoſe health had been ſome time declining, was that morning ſo extremely indiſpoſed, as to be confined to her bed with ſymptoms of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirious fever. Upon their entering the parlour, Miſs Emery, and her mama, immediately began a moſt lamentable duet upon the <hi>monſtrous diſagreeableneſs</hi> of people's being ill—</p>
               <p>"It makes one," ſaid Miſs Emery, "ſo vapouriſh, to ſee the old doctors, and the apothecaries, and nurſes!—"</p>
               <p>"O! abſolutely," cried her mama, "its the moſt exceſſive dull thing in the world!—May be ſhe may die, too!—Really, Emma, I'll return to the Pavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion—I do hate any thing that reminds one of one's latter end. Where's Charlotte?—I hope ſhe is not ſo mad as to be in Miſs Freeman's chamber!"</p>
               <p>At that inſtant Charlotte entered—"So, Mr. Barnwell," ſaid ſhe—here's havoc you've made! Why, Sir, if Miſs Freeman dies, you'll be indicted for murder! She is ſcreaming after Mr. Barnwell, do you know, in ſuch a violent manner that all the old Quizzes are frightened out of their wits."</p>
               <p>"What's all this trifling?" cried Mental, ſtarting from his chair, and thumping his oaken ſtick on the floor. "Shew me to Captain Middleton, Sir—I did not come here to do penance, in liſtening to the
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:038596_0212_1012A05F9198BED8"/>
vapid effuſions of empty heads, and iron hearts—Shew me to Middleton!"</p>
               <p>The ladies were quite terrified—"Lord bleſs me, Mr. Barnwell," cried Mrs. Emery, "who have you brought here?"</p>
               <p>"This gentleman, Madam, has very particular buſineſs with Captain Middleton."</p>
               <p>"Do, pray, then, have the goodneſs to ſhew him into the library. Mr. Emery and the Captain are both there."</p>
               <p>At the door of the library Barnwell announced, that a gentleman deſired to ſee Captain Middleton; and Mr. Emery was politely retiring—</p>
               <p>"Let me requeſt your preſence, Sir," ſaid Mental: "the buſineſs I am about to enter on requires evidence."</p>
               <p>Mr. Emery returned. Captain Middleton bowed to Mental, and entreated him to ſit.—Barnwell, by deſire of the latter, alſo was ſeated. After a pauſe—</p>
               <p>"Gentlemen," ſaid Mental, "I am commiſſioned with the execution of a moſt unpleaſant buſineſs. A perſon, whom I ſincerely regard, has ſuſtained a moſt ſerious injury. He was unfortunately deprived, by death, of a moſt amiable wife, at a period when her maternal attentions began to be loudly called for by their daughter, a beautiful girl of three years old. His affairs, about the ſame time, compelled this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to leave England for ſome years: being unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take his daughter with him abroad; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no female relative or friend with whom he could depoſit his heart's ſole treaſure, he was compelled to place his child with the governeſs of a reſpectable boarding-ſchool. Here ſhe remained, and increaſed in beauty and accompliſhments as ſhe grew in years.</p>
               <p>Well, gentlemen, her father returned, after a long abſence, to his native home, and ſettled in affluent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, in a retired part of the country. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ſtill a widower, for that, and poſſibly for other reaſons, he did not immediately after his return ſend for his daughter from the ſeminary, where, he was convinced, ſhe was improving herſelf in the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments adapted to her ſex and fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="unknown:038596_0213_1012A06122638EF0"/>
"Thus ſhe continued at ſchool till ſhe was about ſeventeen years of age. You'll ſay, perhaps, her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was to blame to continue the care of her, at that thoughtleſs ſeaſon of her life, in the hands of a mere ſchool miſtreſs. Events have proved that it was wrong; but he, a ſort of a Recluſe, little imagined that there were beings baſe enough, among mankind, to plan the ſlow deſtruction of innocence and beauty. We, who are men of the world, know things better, Captain Middleton. <hi>We</hi> know, that girls at the age of ſeventeen, under no other controul than that of a negligent governeſs or a depraved teacher, are very <hi>comeatible</hi> articles—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>?"</p>
               <p>There was an expreſſive ſneer that accompanied this laſt ſentence, which made Middleton tremble.</p>
               <p>"Sir! Eh!" cried the latter; "I don't clearly underſtand your drift."</p>
               <p>"You will ſoon," ſaid Mental. "I meant mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to remark on the extreme ignorance of the old fool, who could truſt ſuch a <hi>charming temptation</hi> in the way of <hi>us red coats!</hi> (for I've ſerved, myſelf in the army) and then be ſurpriſed at its conſequences.</p>
               <p>"But, to proceed with my tale. In the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of this young lady's reſidence there was quartered a regiment of militia, which was graced by a Captain of moſt elegant exterior, and perfectly <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed;</hi> that is, he had run one man through the body, and wounded ſeveral; had figured in a <hi>crim. con.</hi> action, knew the uſe of loaded dice, and would ſee you a <hi>three-bottle</hi> man under the table.</p>
               <p>"For the accommodation of theſe <hi>daſhing</hi> gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, there are certain beings, who aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the name of women; and, under the character and appearance of gentlewomen, contrive an intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the young and inexperienced part of their ſex, with the infernal deſign of debauching their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and rendering them an eaſy prey to ſeduction. Unfortunately for my poor friend, a wretch of this deſcription found means to gain the confidence of his daughter, whoſe volatile diſpoſition, and full flow of
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:038596_0214_1012A06319D26D88"/>
careleſs ſpirits, expoſed a heart, unguarded by princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to the eaſy conqueſt of this harridan.</p>
               <p>"The Captain was introduced to the poor victim, as a friend of this creature's; and, to be brief, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he conſequences were, the ruin of the daughter, and the conſummation of many miſeries to the heart-broken father!"</p>
               <p>"Unhappy man!" ſaid Mr. Emery: "is he ſtill living?"</p>
               <p>"You ſhall hear," cried Mental.—"The arts of thoſe experienced practitioners in iniquity were ſo refined, that the deluded girl eloped from the houſe of her governeſs, and not one probable clue to a diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery was left.—You are a father, Sir; Captain Middleton, I believe, is not: but any man, who has the common feelings of his nature, may picture to himſelf the agony of her parent, when he heard the dread tidings of her fall, and was doomed to remain ignorant of her fate!"</p>
               <p>Captain Middleton, upon whom Mental all along kept his ſtern eyes fixed, began now to half-riſe from his chair, wiped his face with his handkerchief, twirled the chain of his watch round his fingers, and betrayed various other ſymptoms of uneaſineſs.—Mental continued—</p>
               <p>"But, gentlemen, there was an hour approaching replete with yet more piercing anguiſh for his ſoul. The unhappy parent lived to ſee that daughter—but, O, God! what a ſight—He beheld her, ſuffering the laſt agonies of death, on the bare floor of a mean hovel, ſurrounded by miſery and want! and whilſt the poiſon of proſtitution conſumed her frame, the horrors of reflection on a guilty courſe agoniſed her mind! He ſaw her die! <hi>!</hi>—If, then, the wretched parent, at that moment, had ſeen and known the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of this miſery, ſhould you, gentlemen, have been ſurpriſed to hear, that in the phrenzy of his deſpair, he had imbrued his hands in the villain's blood? But 'twas not ſo. Ere he became acquainted with the ſtory I have related to you, his agonies had mellowed into grief, his phenzy into ſettled melancholy.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="216" facs="unknown:038596_0215_1012A0688AA92FE0"/>
"Meanwhile the perpetrator of this deed was buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed in freſh purſuits of the ſame nature, aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the ſame infernal ſpirit, in the form of woman. Undaunted by any of the <hi>vulgar prejudices</hi> of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or feelings; unchecked by the incommodious principles of honor, or virtue, he plunged boldly on, to proſecute the ruin of more beauty; and further to extend the deſolations of domeſtic peace—a family, raiſed by his perfidious promiſes to the pinnacle of proſperous hopes, was hurled from thence to the abyſs of wretchedneſs, poverty, and the views of endleſs thraldom: this was the paſtime of the all-daring villain!"</p>
               <p>Captain Middleton's behaviour now expreſſed thoſe feelings he could no longer ſmother.—Starting from his chair—"You have fixed your eyes on me, Sir, in a manner I am unaccuſtomed to, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany your diſmal ſtories with ſuch ſignificant glances upon me—I can't miſtake their meaning: but, Sir, whoever this friend of your's may be, he is deceived, if he has inſinuated the moſt diſtant charge of this ſort upon a man of my reſpectability!"</p>
               <p>"Your reſpectability!" ha, ha! cried Mental, with a ſneer.</p>
               <p>"D—n me, Sir," cried Middleton, "I will not brook this conduct. Let me ſee this injured father, and I will confront him to his face!"</p>
               <p>"You <hi>will</hi>—then <hi>do</hi>" ſaid Mental. "Behold him, thou reptile! behold him here!!"</p>
               <p>As he ſpoke, he roſe with a majeſtic air, and fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his arms, ſtood oppoſite to Middleton, with a look expreſſive of the deepeſt indignation; whilſt the aſtoniſhed Captain ſtaggered back a full pace, and trembled; Mr. Emery, remaining in complete amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—A ſilence of ſome minutes enſued.</p>
               <p>"The names of Maſters, and Norris, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="217" facs="unknown:038596_0216_1012A06B650B5660"/>
this inſtant, I demand the paltry ſatisfaction of your life.</p>
               <p>Middleton remained dumb. Mr. Emery, extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly terrified, attempted to interpoſe.</p>
               <p>"Silence, man," cried Mental: "You don't <hi>know me.</hi> I am not one, who frames, deſtroys, and frames anew his reſolutions! I come not in the moment of paſſion, to wreak revenge, but calmly to inflict upon a villain the puniſhment of death!"</p>
               <p>"You come to murder, then?" cried Emery.</p>
               <p>"Sir!" ſaid Middleton, after a long ſtruggle of cowardice—"Sir—I—ſee—that—you are—deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, not to liſten to any thing I offer in my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and, therefore, name your place, and time, and take what ſatisfaction you pleaſe."</p>
               <p>"To-morrow, at break of day, which will be four o'clock—behind the mill, two fields from the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lane," ſaid Mental, in a firm tone.</p>
               <p>"I'll meet you there—" ſaid Middleton, who, on this occaſion, was indeed a coward; though, till this moment, he had always retained the credit of great courage. But there was an inexpreſſible ſomething in the countenance of the father, which the ſeducer of the daughter trembled to gaze upon, in ſpite of his inſenſibility to all virtuous emotions.</p>
               <p>"Shall we meet alone, or ſhall thoſe who are now preſent attend us there?" aſked Mental.</p>
               <p>"Is it <hi>impoſſible</hi> to prevent this meeting?" ſaid Emery. "Can no conceſſions—no recompence—."</p>
               <p>"Are you a father," interrupted Mental, "and <hi>you</hi> talk of recompenſe?—If, indeed, he has power to raiſe the dead, and make that pure and ſpotleſs, which his luſt has ſullied, there might be meaning in your ſpeech:—I know no other <hi>recompenſe</hi> that he can offer, or I can receive."</p>
               <p>At length the meeting was arranged. It was agreed, that Mr. Emery and Barnwell ſhould attend; and Mental retired.</p>

               <p>NO ſooner had Mental left the houſe, than Mrs. Emery and her daughters, attended by their <hi>ſhadows,</hi> Morley and Eaſtwood, ruſhed into the library, to learn the errand of ſo ſtrange a <hi>Quiz,</hi> as he was term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Lord Morley.</p>
               <p>It was in vain to attempt concealment, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, partly by Emery, partly by Middleton, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by Barnwell, the whole hiſtory was related of Barnwell's firſt acquaintance with him—of the loſs of his wife—the fate of his daughter—and the reſult of that morning's viſit.</p>
               <p>"A duel!" Screamed Mrs. Emery. "Captain Middleton it ſhall not take place—Run, my Lord—Run, Mr. Eaſtwood, to that fat, ugly fellow of a juſtice we ſaw yeſterday; and, for heaven's ſake, entreat him to get all the conſtables in the place rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to keep the peace."</p>
               <p>"I inſiſt upon it, my Lord, you do not obey ſuch orders—as you will anſwer to my honor. I muſt confeſs that I, as well as many others, have been guilty of improprieties in my younger days, of which I readily acknowledge this one of the worſt.

               <p>"Lor, Ma'!" ſaid Miſs Emery—"Do you think Captain Middleton can't level a piſtol better than old Mental? I have not the leaſt fear, but he'll kill the old brute."</p>
               <p>"And then, will he not be obliged to fly the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?"</p>
               <p>"O, only for a little time, till its blown over?"</p>
               <p>"Only look at Mr. Barnwell!" cried Charlotte, who had been watching his countenance ſome time: "really, now, by the exceſſive length of his viſage, one would imagine <hi>he</hi> were going to fight a duel."</p>
               <p>In fact, Barnwell's mind was abſorbed in very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent meditations. He was anxiouſly calculating the time that had elapſed ſince he had diſpatched the jewels to London; and reflecting on the horrible conſequences, ſhould the man prove diſhoneſt. Arouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by this remark of Charlotte, from his reverie, he unfortunately betrayed his abſence by a ſham laugh, and exclaiming—"A duel! What duel?"</p>
               <p>"There's a hard-hearted wretch, now!" ſaid Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte, "to laugh at ſuch a ſerious thing as a duel!"</p>
               <p>"Whatever the event of to-morrow may be,' ſaid Middleton, "this trifling upon the ſubject is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming. I have made up my mind, Madam:" [to Mrs. Emery] "I am bound in honour to give the meeting; and whoever attempts to prevent it, will throw a ſtain upon my character, that nothing but ſuicide will efface."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Emery ſhrieked and fainted; her daughters flew to her aſſiſtance, and the party ſeparated. Mr. Emery gave directions to Barnwell to diſcharge ſome debts of Captain Middleton's, and retiring with the Captain, to arrange ſome mutual concerns, he deſired Barnwell to let him have his accounts to examine in the evening.</p>

               <p>Some minutes had elapſed before Barnwell remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his eyes from the paper; and when he did, they were covered by a thick film, that obſcured every ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject around him. Cold ſweats ſucceeded; and he had nearly, very nearly, fainted.</p>
               <p>"O, Milwood!" exclaimed he—"Milwood, thou haſt deſtroyed me!"</p>
               <p>He ruſhed out of the houſe, and immediately ran to the little cottage. Breathleſs and pale, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached the ſiren, with the letter open in his hand, and gave it her to peruſe. With the moſt complete hypocriſy imaginable, ſhe ſhrieked—ſhe raved—and imprecated curſes on the man, though the ſham jewels had been made to her own orders. She pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted moſt ſolemnly and impiouſly called on heaven to witneſs her oaths, that they were her mother's jewels; and either the man, ſhe ſaid, muſt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed them, or ſome ſecret thief in her former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidences—</p>
               <p>"Can my Barnwell," ſaid ſhe, "for a moment harbour a thought ſo much beneath his liberal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to indulge, as to ſuppoſe me privy to a fraud? What is there, Barnwell, in my nature like ſuch mean diſhoneſty? Reflect, and anſwer, Sir, whether a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of my ſpirit, even were ſhe vicious, would ſtoop to the paltry pilfering tricks of a Ring-dropper?
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:038596_0220_1012A076EAEB1368"/>
Barnwell, it would have hurt me leſs, had you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed me of a murder!"</p>
               <p>"Nay, Milwood," ſaid the youth, "I have not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed you; but I am diſtracted by the event! What can be done? Mr. Emery has ordered me this eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, this very evening, to make up my accounts.—I am loſt for ever! Never more can I return to him—And whither, O, whither can I go!"</p>
               <p>In the utmoſt agony, he threw himſelf into a chair, and leaned his head upon the table. Milwood, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting the profoundeſt thought, walked about the room.—"The deficiency muſt not be known," cried ſhe. "We muſt prevent this diſcovery by any means."</p>
               <p>"I ſee no poſſible way," ſaid Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"I ſee but one," ſaid ſhe; "and that you will ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to adopt. 'Tis indeed, one that, upon a <hi>ſmall</hi> neceſſity, ought not to be reſorted to; but when, if adopted, it will, to a certainty, prevent diſgrace to yourſelf and family, the utter ruin of all your future proſpects, the horrors of a priſon, and the character of a thief—I think, ſelf-preſervation calls on us to adopt it."</p>
               <p>"Name it," ſaid Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"FORGERY."</p>
               <p>Starting from the chair, with all the wildneſs of deſpair expreſſed in his countenance—"Wretch!—Sorcereſs!—Away—Away! There is a dreadful ruin waits on thy accurſed beauty, and I now ſee it in all its horrors!"</p>
               <p>He would have left the room; but Milwood, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his arm, detained him.</p>
               <p>"Barnwell, were I that daemon your deſpair now exhibits to your mind, I ſhould at once relinquiſh you. What more could ſuch a ſpirit wiſh, than that, in this diſordered ſtate, you ſhould ſeek your maſter. Detection and diſgrace, chains and impriſonment, would follow; but, no, Barnwell!—too cloſely wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is my own deſtiny with thine to ſuffer this: too deeply impreſſed upon my heart, O, youth, are thy
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:038596_0221_1012A078802068E0"/>
endearments, thus to be relinquiſhed. And, by the power that ſees that heart, I ſwear, no fate ſhall ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate us. No, though thine obſtinate reſiſtance ſhould doom thee to the unwholeſome damps of a dark dungeon—ſhould load theſe manly limbs with fetters—I would follow thee, and ſhare in all thy wretchedneſs. I—innocently though it be—yet, I have been the cauſe of your calamities; and never, never will I yield my title to a ſhare of the bitter draught."</p>
               <p>With all the ſofteſt, tendereſt expreſſions, ſhe hung upon him; ſhe embraced him, and bedewed his cheeks with her tears. The ſoul of Barnwell was in an agony—He ſighed—he ſobbed aloud—He cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon his mother, his Eliza, and invoked the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſpirit of his father to direct him!</p>
               <p>"O, think upon the agonies of thy dear friends!" cried ſhe. "Can you reflect a moment on the phrenſy that will ſeize your venerable mother—the pangs that will rend your ſiſter's heart, when they hear a ſon, a brother—."</p>
               <p>"Hold, hold!" cried Barnwell. "They <hi>muſt not, ſhall not!</hi>—Tell me the means that can prevent diſcovery—Quick, quick, unfold them, that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the poſſibility of a retraction, I may pledge my ſoul's eternal welfare to their adoption!"</p>
               <p>"Suppoſe a bill of Exchange was drawn upon Mr. Emery; ſay for five hundred pounds at two months, could you not imitate his acceptance?—If ſo, I would myſelf undertake to negociate it; and long ere it became due we could provide means to prevent its being preſented for payment; and thus the whole tranſaction would remain a ſecret within our own breaſts—You heſitate!—"</p>
               <p>"O, Milwood, what a propoſal! Miſerable wretch, that I am, how am I fallen, that I can with patience liſten to it!"</p>
               <p>"Is this a time for abſtract reaſonings? Is this a moment to moralize, Barnwell? If you are not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſurrender every hope—if you are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:038596_0222_1012A07BAB425740"/>
to expoſe yourſelf, and all that are dear to you to infamy—you muſt act—"</p>
               <p>"I do not heſitate at the crime—for I am ſunk beneath thoſe ſcruples; but I tremble at the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful conſequences of its diſcovery."</p>
               <p>"Abſurd argument!" ſaid Milwood. "A <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,</hi> an almoſt <hi>inſtant</hi> diſcovery muſt take place, if we do not reſort to this, or ſome ſimilar preventive. Againſt the chance of <hi>future</hi> detection there are ten thouſand odds. Time, at leaſt, will be gained; in which we may guard ourſelves againſt the worſt conſequences. Ruin is at the door; and you are weakly arguing, if it be wiſe to fly from it, becauſe there is a poſſibility we may again encounter it."</p>
               <p>"But," ſaid Barnwell; "even if I were to adopt this dreadful alternative, how are you ſure that you could procure money for this bill?"</p>
               <p>"I will engage for three hundred of the five in leſs than ſix hours time."</p>
               <p>"But—But—I—cannot—it is impoſſible!"</p>
               <p>"Barnwell, this weakneſs is unworthy of your nature.—Determine—Are you prepared to tell Mr. Emery, that you have robbed him of three hundred pounds?—Are you prepared to meet the anger of your benefactor, the curſes of a parent, the madneſs of your ſiſter?—"</p>
               <p>"Hold—Hold—for heaven's ſake—or you will drive me to commit that, in deſperation, which, on reflection to have done, will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

               <p>"And rather, Barnwell, much rather, would I ſee you dead at my feet by your own hands, than behold you among felons at the bar of juſtice, a ſpectacle to a gaping multitude!"</p>
               <p>"O, God! that muſt not be!—He would not, he could not, ſurely, proceed to ſuch extremity!"</p>
               <p>"Will you, then, truſt to the hazard of <hi>his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> a matter of ſuch import?—Puerile folly!—Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, I will myſelf ſave you from the effects of your own cowardice."</p>

She produced a ſtamp from her pocket-book, and drew a bill of Exchange upon Mr. Emery, payable in two months, for five hundred pounds.</p>
               <p>"In vain Barnwell aſked her a ſtring of queſtions—How ſhe came by the ſtamp—for what purpoſe ſhe could have it—if ſhe had ever indulged ſuch a thought before—and many others.</p>
               <p>"When you receive the money to replace what you have taken, I will anſwer all theſe jealous queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; till then, I am dumb.—There," [having fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed it] "I have drawn it in the fictitious name of Emily D'Alembert, and dated it from Southampton: I ſhall paſs it as the ſignature of an emigrant friend. Now, in a word, will you put Mr. Emery's accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to it, or not?"</p>
               <p>"Oh, Milwood!—over what a dreadful precipice do we hover!"</p>
               <p>"And yet, inſenſible to the danger, you loiter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on its very brink.—Barnwell, if you have the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of a man; nay, if you merely poſſeſs the policy of a coward, heſitate no longer.

               <p>AFTER an abſence of two hours, Milwood return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the cottage, where Barnwell waited in a ſtate of mind beyond the powers of language to deſcribe—Guilt, terror, and remorſe, haunted his breaſt, and created there a hell torments!</p>

               <p>"Uncertain of the events of the next hour," ſaid he, "I have prepared either for death or flight. If I ſhould fall, let <hi>this</hi> packet be opened immediately after my remains are brought hither <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>The ſtate of Barnwell's mind was ill adapted to remonſtrate at that time, even could he have imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed remonſtrance of the leaſt avail with ſuch a man as Mental. Much, indeed, he wiſhed to relate to him how far he had himſelf deviated from the paths of rectitude; much he wiſhed to declare the horrors of remorſe, and fears of diſgrace, that tortured his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſoul; but the ſolemnity of the hour forbid him. He could not diſturb the tranquillity of Mental's bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom at a time, when, of all others, it became him, if poſſible, to increaſe it.</p>
               <p>As they were walking towards the field, Mental, gazing round upon the opening beauties of the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſcene, ſaid—</p>
               <p>"In a little time, probably, this vaſt and wond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Theatre of Nature will be for ever ſhut to me! and what ſhall ſucceed it?—Vain inquiry!

He heſitates, ere he can affix to any little ſpot on earth, the <hi>Divine</hi> Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Futurity; and riſing ſuperior to the little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſelf, inquires how he may reconcile the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of Omnipotence with ſo confined a notion.—Hence, he no longer broods o'er forms and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; he ceaſes to let down the energies of thought to ſilly ſcrutinies of trivial exteriors; but, unfettering his ſoul from chains of human workmanſhip, gives it bold flight, e'en to the ſtretch of Reaſon.

               <p>"One error generally accompanies this originality of mind, from which I have been far from free—"forgetfulneſs of the general ſtate of mankind"—which calls for the <hi>ſlow</hi> and <hi>gradual</hi> removal of the veil of prejudices, and on which too ſudden a glare of light muſt neceſſarily produce effects, the very op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to thoſe intended by the benevolence of true philoſophers.</p>
               <p>"A deep conſideration of this fact has made me lament having publiſhed ſome ſtrong truths, which have unſettled many minds from that foundation on which they had reſted, ere any new and more ſolid baſe was formed for their ſupport; and has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed me ſtrongly in the opinion, that REFORMA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION is much better adapted to the purpoſes of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy than the beſt planned REVOLUTION. I feel a relief to my mind, in making this free apology for my own conduct, and ſincere confeſſion of my ſentiments, at this time, moſt probably ſo near my <hi>exit</hi> from theſe ſcenes.

               <p>This ſermon (for ſuch the ſolemnity of Mental's manner made it appear) finiſhed, as they were within ſight of the mill.—They had not arrived three mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes before they were joined by Captain Middleton and Mr. Emery. The paces were meaſured, the piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols loaded, and the antagoniſts took the ground. The ſurpriſe which had made a coward of Middleton, had worn away, and he now reſumed that courage for which he was celebrated. They were to fire to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at a ſignal from Mr. Emery. The word was given—Mental's ball grazed the ſhoulder of Captain Middleton, who fired in the air.</p>
               <p>"How is this?" exclaimed Mental—"why did you fire in the air?"</p>
               <p>"Having received your fire, Sir," ſaid the Captain. "I preſume I may now, without the imputation of cowardice, ſolicit your attention for a few minutes to ſome obſervations I would offer. When you have heard me, it ſhall remain for your deciſion, whether this affair ſhall proceed. If it is your wiſh to fire again, I ſhall think myſelf juſtified in returning it, after the explanation I may offer, and the ſatisfaction I have already afforded by receiving your ball."</p>
               <p>"I cannot refuſe to hear you, Sir; but our ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion requires you ſhould be brief."</p>
               <p>"If I could prove, from the moſt certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences," ſaid the Captain, "that your daughter lives—."</p>
               <p>"My daughter lives!" exclaimed Mental, ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—Pſha, pſha, pſha!—I ſaw her die—I ſaw the earth receive her poor remains into its boſom! Why, then, this paltry evaſion?"</p>
               <p>"I am patient," ſaid the Captain, "I bear with the effuſions of your ſorrow—but, believe me, Sir,—if the unfortunate girl, whom the madneſs of deſire urged me to ſeduce, and whoſe name was Mental,

               <p>"Saw her laſt night!" echoed Mental, claſping his hands together—"I hope not—No, no—it cannot be—I ſaw her die."</p>
               <p>"You muſt have been deceived, Sir, by ſome ſtrong reſemblance of perſon, or ſome ſtriking coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidence of circumſtances—for, by Heaven, I repeat, Miſs Mental lives!"</p>
               <p>"Wonderful, wonderful!" ſaid Mental, in a voice barely audible, with his folded hands placed to his eyes.</p>
               <p>"After the ſtrong impreſſion of her death, which you have received," ſaid the Captain, "nothing will, perhaps, convince you of her exiſtence, unleſs you were to ſee her."</p>
               <p>"See her! ſee her!" exclaimed Mental, fearfully looking around him!—"Is ſhe near me?—I would rather embrace the ſevereſt tortures Cruelty ere fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed!—See her!—horrible!—horrible!"</p>
               <p>As he ceaſed, the teeth chattered in his head, and his whole frame was convulſed.</p>
               <p>"Your arm, my friend," continued he, to Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. "I am faint."</p>
               <p>He reclined his head on Barnwell's ſhoulder. Mr. Emery then advanced, and propoſed retiring to his houſe, that Captain Middleton might relate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of the preceding evening, from which Mr. Mental might draw his own concluſions. He ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and by a ſlow walk they arrived there. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal aſked for a glaſs of water, and, after taking it, requeſted Captain Middleton to proceed.</p>
               <p>"It is a very conſiderable time, Sir," ſaid the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, "<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>"Facts, facts, Sir, if you pleaſe, and ſpare your comments," ſaid Mental.</p>
               <p>"Since our ſeparation, I underſtand, ſhe viſited

Rome, Florence, and ſeveral of the Italian States, in company with a young nobleman, whom, at length, ſhe left, and ſunk into that way of living."</p>
               <p>"I underſtand, Sir—" interrupted Mental—"Pray, go on."</p>
               <p>"From that period, till laſt night, I have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ignorant of her entirely. In conſequence of the intended meeting of this morning, I had occaſion for my attorney. Fortunately, I learnt he was in Ramſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, and he waited on me. The cauſe of our meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of courſe, was mentioned; when to my aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he declared, your daughter was at that moment alive, and in Ramſgate! He cannot be deceived, for he knew her as early as myſelf, and has correſponded with her ever ſince."</p>
               <p>"In Ramſgate!" muttered Mental; "ſo near me, too!"</p>
               <p>"Yes," replied the Captain. "She reſides in a ſmall cottage near the ſea, and aſſumes the name of Milwood."</p>
               <p>Barnwell turned pale as the dead; his knees ſhook, and his head ſunk upon his breaſt. Mental, almoſt as much affected, had yet more preſence of mind; and ſaid, with particular emphaſis; <hi>We</hi> muſt inquire into this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and endeavour to <hi>conceal our emotions for the preſent."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Barnwell took the hint; and continuing to hold down his head, made every exertion in his power to ſcreen his aſtoniſhment from obſervation.</p>
               <p>"Where is this attorney, Sir," ſaid Mental.</p>
               <p>"In this houſe," replied the Captain. "Hoping to gain your attention, I requeſted he would be ready to corroborate, by his teſtimony, what I have aſſerted. I will ſtep for him."</p>
               <p>"Nay, Sir," ſaid Mental; "<hi>I</hi> will examine him in private. Lead me to him."</p>
               <p>This manoeuvre of Mental's, to prevent the meeting of Blackmore and Barnwell, was truly acceptable to the latter, who would, moſt probably, have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed by the preſence of Blackmore, into a prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture confeſſion of his connection.</p>

The time that Mental was out of the room, was occupied by the obſervations of Mr. Emery and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton on this diſcovery; whilſt Barnwell's mind was abſorbed in contemplating the conſequences it would produce.</p>
               <p>At length Mental returned, and, addreſſing himſelf to Captain Middleton—</p>
               <p>"I am convinced," ſaid he, "from the narrative of this man, that ſhe, over whoſe grave I have wept, was not my daughter. I doubt not but ſhe lives.—This diſcovery gives birth to many difficulties, which I muſt overcome; my life, therefore, is neceſſary; and I am thus obliged to relinquiſh, at leaſt for the preſent, any further claim which the laws of honor may allow me." He then beckoned Barnwell, and they left the room together.</p>

               <p>MENTAL and Barnwel paſſed the diſtance from Mr. Emery's houſe to the lodgings of the former, in the profoundeſt ſilence. When they entered the room, the ſight of the two packets affected Mental extremely.</p>
               <p>"I did not expect to ſee theſe papers again," ſaid he; "but who could have imagined the events of this hour! Who could have doubted ſuch appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances? The miſerable being whom I depoſited in the grave, Barnwell, was the friend and companion of

Elinor when ſhe reſided in Holborn; her name really Ellen. Thus whilſt I have imagined ſhe had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from our world, the guilty wretch has been ſaying ſnares to entangle you. O, my poor brain!"</p>
               <p>Overpowered by the ſtrength of his feelings, he ſunk into a chair, and reclined his head on the table. He wept.</p>
               <p>"Tears!" exclaimed he. "Well—well!—a few ſtruggles more, and nature muſt yield. But you, O, ill-fated youth, what muſt be your feelings! The dupe of ſuch conſummate artifice—how muſt your boſom burn with indignation againſt the—againſt my daughter!"</p>
               <p>"O, Sir!" exclaimed Barnwell, with a heart too full for further utterance.</p>
               <p>"Fly to her," cried Mental: "upbraid her! heap on her the curſes of a father!"</p>
               <p>"Hold—hold!" ſaid Barnwell. "It cannot be—it is impoſſible—that a countenance, which beſpeaks the calm, ſerene felicity of angels, can diſguiſe ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved a heart! There muſt be more Milwood's than one. She, whom I know, cannot be your Elinor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet ſuch myſterious ſecreſy—ſuch contradictory narrations—ſuch evidence, too!—O, God! if it ſhould be ſo!"</p>
               <p>"Poor youth!" cried Mental. "Fain would I comfort you; but when the recollection of the ſource whence flows your miſery darts through my brain—can I reflect upon a proſtituted child—can I contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the ruin of innocence I ought to have preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and be calm?"</p>
               <p>In agony the wretched father ſtamped his feet, and claſped his hands together, with a groan that pierced the heart of Barnwell. Then, with an effort, recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering himſelf—</p>
               <p>"But this is woman's weakneſs; this is diſgrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful impotence of mind, thus to be ſtartled at a phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom! for what more is it? I will ſtill ſuppoſe her dead—ſhe ſhall be as dead to me—ay, and to you, too, youth!" continued he, taking Barnwell by the

hand, ho had ſhaken his head ſignificantly: "Yes, we muſt each conſole the other, as though each had followed to the grave the object of his hopes and love. Let us upbraid each other's weakneſs, if a tear gliſten in the eye, or a ſigh eſcape its priſon of the heart! there, cloſe captives, let our ſorrows lie; and, though they ſtruggle with a giant's ſtrength to eſcape their bonds, not till the burſting of the heart, in death, be they our conquerors! How ſay you, boy, can you do this? Or will you crouch before the rod of Fate, ſmart under the diſcipline of fooliſh griefs, and whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per like an infant for a broken toy?—Come—let us ſwear, never to behold her more!"</p>
               <p>"O!—Impoſſible—impoſſible!" cried Barnwell. "The love I cheriſh has become the ſource of my exiſtence; it is woven with life itſelf;—and their duration is coeval, Nor can I—pardon me, Sir—approve your conduct. What if ſhe be fallen as low in infamy as we are told—what if her former life has been a ſcene of vice!—Might not a father's hand, extended, preſerve her from ſtill lower depths of ſin? Is it not poſſible your Elinor might yet become the ſolace of your latter days?"</p>
               <p>"What madneſs!" ſaid Mental.—"Wild in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuation! Do you not know that the loſt being has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a <hi>profeſſor</hi> of <hi>iniquity?</hi> 'Tis not a lapſe of human nature ſhould make me thus reſolve.—Had ſhe ſought theſe arms, when the accurſed ſeducer firſt abandoned her; had ſhe brought to me the heart that he ſpurned from him; think you a man, ſo much above the prejudices of the vulgar, would have diſclaimed her for the weakneſs of her nature? No! I would have nurſed her penitence in my pitying bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom—I would have healed her wounded heart with a father's beſt affections! But, now—when the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of her nature is exchanged for the ſordid purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of intereſt; when the affections of her heart are all evaporated, and in their channel flows a ſtream of putrid paſſions—pride, envy, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

overtures of reconciliation on my part, but inſolent denials? The delight that ſwells the boſoms of the parent and the child, is virtuous joy! The ſmiles of a father, is bliſs unſpeakable to a virtuous breaſt; but, to a corrupted heart, is as the ſight of heaven to the fallen angels!"</p>
               <p>Barnwell liſtened moſt attentively.</p>
               <p>"If, indeed, you are purſuaded," ſaid he, "that ſhe is ſo far abandoned, which I, who have ſo lately ſeen her, cannot allow, yet, even then, admitting ſhe ſpurned all overtures of a father's aid in a return to virtue, would not the thought, that <hi>you had offered it,</hi> afford ſome conſolation?"</p>
               <p>Mental ſtarted, and pauſed a conſiderable time.</p>
               <p>"No, no—it muſt not be," cried he. "Your ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion ſtruck me for the moment; but, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. I am convinced it would prove a fruitleſs offer, and only add to her deſpair."</p>
               <p>"Still you argue," ſaid Barnwell, "on the ground, that ſhe is irreparably loſt. If you could ſee her—if you but heard her ſentiments—."</p>
               <p>"Deception is her trade," cried Mental. "But, yet, I am half inclined to ſee her."</p>
               <p>"O, do!" cried Barnwell, with quickneſs.</p>
               <p>"If I were ſure ſhe would not know me—And ſo little reſemblance to the portrait do I now bear, that, I think, it is impoſſible ſhe could—I would ſee her."</p>
               <p>"Obey this impulſe, Sir—it is the voice of nature, and I will hope the happieſt effects. She muſt, ſhe ſhall, prove virtuous yet; for 'tis in vain to talk of tearing from your heart her lovely image!"</p>
               <p>"Softly youth," cried Mental. "Let not paſſion bear away remembrance. Grant that we ſucceeded to our utmoſt hopes; what would follow—but that ſhe ſhould forſake the throngs of ſociety, and in the ſolitude of retirement calm the tumultuous ſea of paſſions that rages in her boſom. You do not, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, for a moment, Barnwell, think of renewing a connection with a common proſtitute!"</p>
               <p>"Do I hear you, Sir!" cried Barnwell, his cheeks
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:038596_0236_1012A0A44169E0A0"/>
tinged with a roſy glow, his breaſt heaving with the impetuoſity of youthful paſſion—"Was it Mr. Mental that I heard? Impoſſible! 'Twas the croak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice of Prejudice, that blended the ſuppoſition of returning virtue and a hiding-place together. A MONK could not preach otherwiſe, indeed! But I diſdain the notion. O, were Milwood virtuous <hi>now,</hi> not all the ſcreams and howlings of a wondering world ſhould fright me from her arms!"</p>
               <p>"Youth," cried Mental, with an expreſſive gaze—"Youth, I admire and tremble—Hear my determination:—The attorney Blackmore is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely in my power—ſome practices, of which he was guilty in the affairs of Norris, would tranſport him. On his lips, therefore, I have a ſeal. My daughter is ignorant of the duel, and its cauſes; ſhe will remain ſo. Could it, then, be contrived to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, for a day or two, as a friend of your's, into her company—by which means I might judge of her for myſelf, and act accordingly?"</p>
               <p>"Nothing more eaſy," ſaid Barnwell. "You might, for a few days, occupy a room in the cottage. 'Tis an excellent thought; and I cheriſh the ſtrongeſt hope of its ſucceſs."</p>
               <p>After ſeveral obſtacles were removed, this plan was reſolved on, and Barnwell went to prepare for its execution.</p>
               <p>Milwood had ſcarcely riſen, when Barnwell enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cottage. Surpriſed at ſo early a viſit, the firſt thought that occurred to her was, that the forgery had been already detected, though Blackmore, in whoſe hands ſhe placed the note, had declared he would not negociate it for at leaſt a month; in which period ſhe propoſed the concluſion of her ſchemes on Barnwell. She was agreeably diſappointed, therefore, when he acquainted her with the nature of his errand; deſcribing Mental as an old gentleman from whom he had conſiderable expectations, who wiſhed to reſide ſome time at Ramſgate incog. It was ſettled, that a bed ſhould be prepared for him by
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:038596_0237_1012A0A5D1786598"/>
the evening. Influenced, as it was, by contending emotions, Barnwell's behaviour did not eſcape the penetration of Milwood.—</p>
               <p>"Are you unwell, Barnwell?" ſaid ſhe.</p>
               <p>"No," replied he.</p>
               <p>"Your mind is uneaſy, then?"</p>
               <p>"What ſhould make it ſo?—Do I not poſſeſs your love—your whole heart?—Milwood, you never loved another as you love me!"</p>
               <p>"Never. But why that queſtion?"</p>
               <p>"There are others of the name of Milwood in the world, I ſhould ſuppoſe; or elſe calumny has been buſy with your's!"</p>
               <p>"Who dare calumniate my character?" and ſhe bluſhed deeply.</p>
               <p>"Nay, I did not ſay 'twas yours. But my friend, whom you will ſee to-night, ſoon as I mentioned the name of Milwood, and expreſſed to him (for he is my ſecond ſelf) the nature of our connection, ſtarted, and then detailed ſome tales that he had heard of <hi>one</hi> Milwood. But they could not relate to you."—</p>
               <p>"'Twas not kind, Sir, to refuſe my poor requeſt of ſecreſy for a few more days; but to convince you how ſuperior I feel to any tale of calumny, I am glad your friend is coming. He will not ſcruple to repeat it, I ſhould hope."</p>
               <p>"I never knew him ſhrink from his own act."</p>
               <p>Enough had paſſed to convince Milwood ſhe was ſuſpected. When, therefore, Barnwell prepared to take leave, ſhe made no attempt to detain him; but immediately after his departure went in ſearch of Blackmore, and challenged him with treachery: he, from a dread of Mental, perſiſted to the contrary; and declared, that he had not uttered a ſyllable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning her. Deſtitute of any other good of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, ſhe now turned her thoughts again towards this ſtranger, and prepared herſelf for a detection. Summoning to her aid all the powers ſhe poſſeſſed, ſhe waited with conſiderable anxiety his arrival.</p>

Has ſuch been Milwood's!—Have I not offered her my hand?—Might ſhe not have been my wife, with half the efforts that it has coſt her to procure five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds? Beſides, has ſhe not ſhared the crime, and conſequent hazard of detection and death? Had ſhe, when ſhe obtained that ſum, fled from the reach of juſtice, I could at once decide upon her motives, But, no.—Jewels, which ſhe imagined worth more than that ſum, were in her poſſeſſion—theſe ſhe parted with:—for what?—To purchaſe a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe from her huſband!—Has ſhe, then, a huſband? If not, why pretend ſo? Then, her uncle! If ſhe is, indeed, Mental's daughter, ſhe, can have no uncle. Blackmore, too!—the creature of Middleton!—He, it ſeems, is the diſcoverer of this loſt daughter; and he finds her—in Milwood—whoſe huſband, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, was his client!—By heavens, 'tis a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy—a juggle!—But how to detect it? To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night's interview will probably throw ſome light on this myſterious buſineſs; but to me, it ſeems im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible ſhe can be Mental's daughter!"</p>

                  <pb n="240" facs="unknown:038596_0239_1012A0AD18DEBAD0"/>
To theſe reflections ſucceeded others, reſpecting that dreadful act to which the ſiren had urged him.—</p>
               <p>"Forgery!" exclaimed he to himſelf. "Who, I—I commit a forgery!—Spirit of my father, did you ſee the deed?—Where is the fatal paper?—Perhaps, ere this, detected, traced!—And <hi>who,</hi> cries an inquiring world, <hi>who</hi> was the villain?—Horrible, horrible!—Three hundred pounds may yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem it. I'll inſtantly aſk it of Mr. Emery. Why do I heſitate?—My embarraſſment will betray me.—Shall I, then, acknowledge to him, in time, what I have done? Coward, that I am, my heart ſinks at the idea! The diſtreſſes of Mental, at this moment, render it cruelty to obtrude another's miſeries up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.—My uncle!—my mother!—Gracious God! it would be parricide to let them know that I am ſuch a villain!"</p>
               <p>In the moſt diſtracted ſtate of mind he paſſed the remainder of the day; ſeeking every opportunity of ſolitude, dreading the glance of every eye, ſtarting at every footſtep; retracing, with an aching heart, the paſt, and contemplating the future, almoſt with deſpair!</p>
               <p>Evening arrived. He repaired to Mental, who awaited his call to accompany him to Milwood's cottage, having diſguiſed himſelf in the habit of an Hanoverian, in which he had formerly travelled.</p>
               <p>"Now for an effort, young friend," ſaid he. "But, methinks, you do not brave this warfare of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions with the fortitude that becomes you:—your brow is marked with grief; your eye lowers, and you ſigh! Come, come—be more yourſelf! One in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview, moſt probably, will announce the future deſtinies of us both. I tremble for myſelf; and yet I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> act the hero for your example. Should ſhe reſemble her mother!—But, come—the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning is advanced.</p>
               <p>Barnwell bowed in ſilence, and they ſet forward for the cottage.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Milwood had not been idle.
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:038596_0240_1012A0AFF0D8CA90"/>
Every channel of inquiry had been drained. Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more had been entreated, and threatened, in vain; he had diſcloſed nothing, and the reſult of all her induſtry was vague uncertainty, as to the expected ſtranger. She did not fail, however, to make ſuch preparations as might evince to Barnwell her deſire to pleaſe. The entertainment that ſhe provided for his friend was deficient in nothing that her ſituation permitted her to procure.</p>
               <p>Mental and Barnwell arrived. She ſaw them open a wicket gate, at the entrance of a gravel walk that led to the cottage door. She placed herſelf to receive them. Mental ſtarted at the threſhold, and retired a pace or two—It <hi>was</hi> his daughter that he beheld; and in <hi>her</hi> he ſaw her unfortunate mother! To ſcreen his confuſion, Barnwell attracted the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of Milwood, by ſaying—"This is Mr. Townley, whom I mentioned this morning. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances rendering a temporary concealment neceſſary, he has choſen this diſguiſe to inſure it." Milwood, having ſurveyed the ſtranger circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſaid—"As the friend of my Barnwell, Sir, you are welcome: acquaintance, I doubt not, will teach me to reſpect you on your own account."</p>
               <p>Mental bowed, and, in a faltering voice, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied—"I am a plain man, Madam, and too much out of humour with my own deſtiny to accommodate my muſcles to a ſmile of gallantry; but, I thank you, and, rough as my manners may appear to you, I ſhall not be <hi>an inſenſible obſerver of your actions.</hi> My young friend has, I preſume, acquainted you with my cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which to you may wear the ſemblance of capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious whims; but, 'twas upon the aſſurance of your compliance with them that I trouble you with my company for a day or two.</p>
               <p>"In the firſt place, I muſt entreat you to forbear all thoſe obtruſive attentions, called civility, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs. I can't bear teazing; my nerves are irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Thus if I chooſe to ſpend my day in my chamber, you will not be rapping at my door, with
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:038596_0241_1012A0B187757450"/>
ſilly importunities to ſee your garden, or to walk, or ride, thinking that I am too much alone; and ſuch frivolity. I hate it. Again, if ſometimes a ſtrange ejaculation paſs my lips, don't lift your hands and eyes to heaven with ſtupid admiration; nor cry—'Sir!—what did you ſay?' In ſhort, however I may demean myſelf, be this your rule—that as I have capacity and will, ſo let that will be free. Now, by your leave, I'll to my bed at once."</p>
               <p>"We muſt, in all reſpects comply with my friend's wiſhes; and cannot better ſhew our willingneſs to pleaſe, than by forbearance to expreſs as much," ſaid Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"'Tis an early hour to retire," ſaid Milwood; "but, knowing your inclination, I willingly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply."</p>
               <p>Barnwell conducted him to a ſmall chamber. Mental graſped his hand—"We muſt not talk," ſaid he, in a whiſper. "My pen ſhall do the office of my tongue. Stay not here to night. Suffice it, for the preſent <hi>That I have ſeen my daughter!</hi>—Go, or we ſhall awake ſuſpicion. In the morning be here, and I will contrive to ſlip into your hand, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed, my written obſervations. Farewell—Be reſolute." Upon his return to Milwood, ſhe over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed him with queſtions reſpecting the ſtranger: and Barnwell was compelled to preſevere in falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods. Among other queſtions which ſhe put to him—"Is he rich?" ſaid ſhe.</p>
               <p>"Very rich." ſaid Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"And who are his heirs?"</p>
               <p>"He has none; nor, at preſent, any friend but me."</p>
               <p>"Then you would, moſt probably, inherit all his wealth, were he to die."</p>
               <p>"Diſtant, far diſtant, be the day of his death!" cried Barnwell; "though ten times his wealth ſhould be mine at that period."</p>
               <p>Milwood pondered a moment; and her expreſſive eyes proclaimed ſome mighty purpoſe was juſt then
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:038596_0242_1012A0B5B91D4EB0"/>
generated in her brain. Barnwell obſerved it not. She made no effort to detain him, when he tool his leave, but ſuffered him to depart, with the promiſe of an early viſit in the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The inſtant he was gone, ſhe diſmiſſed her maid for the evening; and, ſhutting herſelf in her chamber, committed the offspring of her mind to paper, in the form of a letter to the Chevalier Zelotti, an Italian, whom ſhe met at Bologna. It is neceſſary to obſerve, that this Italian was the wretch who had put the finiſhing touches to the character of Milwood, whoſe real hiſtory this is the proper period for diſcloſing.</p>
               <p>It is unneceſſary to retrace the ſubject father back than her elopement, from Mrs. Orme's academy, with Captain Middleton. At that epoch ſhe poſſeſſed all the levity of youth, uncontrouled by principles of any ſolidity. Eſtranged from her parents, ſhe felt for them, or their memory, no regard. Her heart wanted an attachment, and Captain Middleton, aided by the infamous Maſters, accompliſhed her ruin with eaſe.</p>
               <p>Her reſidence, whilſt ſhe continued with Middleton, was principally at Tunbridge Wells; where, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatiated with his object, Middleton deſerted her. She flew to Mrs. Maſters, and, having made her election for her future courſe of life, that woman inſtructed her in many of the arts neceſſary for the profeſſion ſhe had choſen.</p>
               <p>'Twas at this period ſhe formed an acquaintance with the ſon of the Earl of—, and accompanied him, through the connivance of his tutor, in a tour to ſeveral of the courts of Europe. During the period of this connection, ſhe had ample opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of obſerving the amazing diſparity of doctrines and practice among the clergy of the church of Rome; a circumſtance that unhappily rivetted that diſguſt ſhe had cheriſhed for religion in general.</p>
               <p>At Bologna, the young nobleman, her patron, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a conſiderable time, in conſequence of numerous recommendations to the nobility there, ſeveral of
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:038596_0243_1012A0B9DE0C1F98"/>
whom were allied to the maternal branches of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily. Here it was that the Chevalier Zelotti firſt preſented himſelf to Milwood. She conceived a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent attachment to his perſon, almoſt at firſt ſight, and a ſhort acquaintance gave birth to a reciprocation of paſſion.</p>
               <p>Intrigue, in Italy, is one of the buſineſſes of life; and the ſimilarity of unſhackled ſentiment ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved every obſtacle to the gratification of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. The ſame contempt for the laws which govern ſociety, the ſame ridicule of ſcruples under the name of prejudices, the ſame unlimited gratification of their own wills, actuated Zelotti and Milwood. The mind of Milwood was ſtrong and maſculine; but Zelotti, in addition to natural ſtrength of intellect, poſſeſſed the advantage of experience; having received a Monkiſh education; having paſſed ſome years in the army; and having been employed as private ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to a nobleman, who was ſome time ambaſſador at Venice.</p>
               <p>When Milwood was obliged either to accompany the young dupe of her charms to England, or diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er her infidelity, and remain with Zelotti, it was agreed in conſultation to prefer the former, under an engagement from Zelotti to viſit her in England, as ſoon as his finances enabled him. They ſeparated, but their correſpondence had ever ſince remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broken.</p>
               <p>The Earl of—died ſoon after the return of his ſon from the Continent, who, ſucceeding to the title and eſtate, diſmiſſed his former connections, and ſhortly after married.</p>
               <p>At this period Milwood became diſtreſſed, and was compelled, for a time, to accept the friendly offers of the unhappy Ellen, whoſe acquaintance ſhe had acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally acquired; and being ſeized with a lingering illneſs, was almoſt reduced to want. Then it was that the portrait of her father was diſpoſed of by her friend, which circumſtance led Mental to the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of her death.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="245" facs="unknown:038596_0244_1012A0BB7016D638"/>
In the mean time, Zelotti had ſo well played his game in Italy, that he married the dowager of a Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentine merchant, of immenſe property, with whom he reſided a ſhort period; and then, by the aid of poiſon, diſencumbered the poſſeſſions ſhe brought him from their unwelcome clogg. He had, however, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed his paſſion for Milwood for a new face, which preſented itſelf in the perſon of a native of Florence, of mean extraction, who willingly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied a man of his wealth to England.</p>
               <p>Their letters mutually acquainted them with each other's ſituation, and the utmoſt freedom was uſed by both. Milwood did not diſdain to accept the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary aſſiſtance ſhe wanted, and the liberality of Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotti raiſed her from diſtreſs. Her indiſpoſition was of the moſt lingering nature; and ſhe paſſed many months without the hope of recovery.</p>
               <p>During the whole of this period ſhe reſided at Southampton, with Zelotti and his miſtreſs; and, if the word is not diſhonored by the uſe, they lived in habits of unbounded friendſhip, without the return of paſſion. As the health of Milwood returned, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, her charms once more appeared, and thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires revived ſtrongly in her boſom, which ſhe had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver aimed to controul.</p>
               <p>In this criſis of her hiſtory ſhe learnt from Zelotti the character of Mr. Emery, who was then at South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton, and had actually reſolved upon a conqueſt there; when, from the ſame ſource, ſhe gathered the intelligence of Barnwell's innocence and inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and without a moment's heſitation changed her intention. The ſucceſs of her attempts are thus far known. The letter to Zelotti runs thus:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <p>He is this inſtant gone.—The ſtranger, I mentioned in my laſt letter, ſleeps at this moment in the room above that in which I now write. He appears an original. If his hiſtory is to be obtained, you know me too well to doubt my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. He is rich, Zelotti—very rich; and Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, to a certainty, his inheritor.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="246" facs="unknown:038596_0245_1012A0BEA3F57990"/>
What idea aſſociates itſelf with this information in <hi>your</hi> brain? When we firſt ſketched the outlines of our plan, at Southampton, Sir James Barnwell's death, you recollect, was decided. Would not old Townley's wealth buy the ſame pleaſures as old Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's? The one is in our power: a ſimple infuſion in his drink would ſend him quietly away, and yield us all we wiſh.</p>
                     <p>To accompliſh our original deſign I begin to think it a work of greater labor than we imagined. The expence and plans we have already encountered have not been trifling. Blackmore's charges for the buſineſs at Brompton are enormous; and hitherto we have received in return, nothing. The forged acceptance for five hundred has coſt us three, and can only be uſed as an incentive to that act, from which the fruits of all our labours are to reſult.—Should the young ſinner diſappoint us there, a <hi>very fruitful</hi> enterprize it will prove!</p>
                     <p>Zelotti, I have ever held thee a maſter in thine art; but, really, the arrangements in this affair add nothing to thy fame!—the jewel ſcheme excepted (for which I thank you:)—the other branches of your plan I have been ſo frequently compelled to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that, intoxicated with paſſion as Barnwell is, I wonder at the blindneſs, which has not, more than once, detected contradictions abſolutely glaring.—Here is an opportunity of retrieving your eminence, in my opinion. Exert it, man.</p>
                     <p>There is a ſort of lethargy, I have obſerved of late, from your epiſtles, has ſeized thee, my Zelotti. Arouſe thoſe drowſy faculties the hand of nature ſo profuſely has beſtowed. Look round thee, man, and mark the eagar zeal with which the plodding dupes of laws and ſyſtems run in their limited purſuits; their courſe hedged in on either hand by rules and cuſtoms, and bounded by a cowardice of conſcience. Yet how many of this deſcription are there, who amaſs wealth, gain honor, and are borne upon the ſhoulders of the crowd! What, then, ſhould be their
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:038596_0246_1012A0C31D1E9700"/>
lofty daring, who own no law but prudence, and laugh at the Nonentity, called Conſcience, which ſcares the multitude?</p>
                     <p>Think on this, Zelotti; and ſay, if this old Townley muſt muſt not be diſmiſſed from the ſcenes of men?—Deviſe ſome ſafe and certain means of doing this, and of enſuring to ourſelves the advantage of his death.</p>
                     <p>Good night—I ſeek my pillow;—and in my dreams I ſhall doubtleſs view bones, that are <hi>'marrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,'</hi> ſtalk round my chamber; eyes glare at me, in which there is 'no luſtre;' and bloody hands, that draw the curtain of my bed!—But, I ſhall wake, and know <hi>''tis but a dream.'</hi>—Good night, once more, Zelotti, ſays your</p>

               <p>AT the reſidence of Mr. Emery a general joy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played itſelf for the ſafety of the Captain; and Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well was tormented with queſtions concerning the old Quiz, as Mental was denominated by the young ladies. Mrs. Emery herſelf ſummoned him to her dreſſing-room, and tortured him with an hour's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation on that ſubject; and on another which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned him much pain.</p>
               <p>"And ſo," ſaid ſhe, "the brute won't ſee his <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of a daughter, though he made ſuch a <hi>fuſs</hi> about her, and abſolutely frightened one to death with his challenge!—Well—let's hear no more of the wretch!—But, my dear Barnwell," continued ſhe, "I have another and much more important affair to mention to you—an affair of the heart! I ſhall be as candid as poſſibly one can on a ſubject of ſuch exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive

delicacy; and I am amazingly much deceived, if I do not meet in a mind like your's, <hi>ſuſceptible of tender impreſſions,</hi> and alive to <hi>thoſe delicate ſenſations,</hi> as I may ſay—that is—I mean <hi>ſenſibility!—ſoftneſs of ſoul!</hi>—and <hi>all that!</hi>—You underſtand me."</p>
               <p>"Madam!" ſaid Barnwell, bluſhing deeply.</p>
               <p>The lady reclining her head, and playing with her fan, continued, "I ſay—that is—it is unneceſſary to ſay—but in the preſent ſtate of ſociety, when marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges are entered into without a conſultation of that <hi>congeniality</hi> of <hi>ſentiments;</hi> and people are thrown toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as it were, like blanks and prizes in a lottery: Why, it cannot be wondered at, that affection ſhould not always follow, where parents or guardians—Heigho! Its exceſſively warm," (fanning herſelf)—"Do, pray, throw that door open."</p>
               <p>It was her chamber-door. Barnwell obeyed, and was retiring.</p>
               <p>"Stay, Sir—I—I—Pray, Mr. Barnwell, can you conceive what can poſſibly engage Mr. Emery ſo perpetually from home?"</p>
               <p>"No, Madam. I—"</p>
               <p>"Not that I deem it a misfortune; he is ſo moroſe in his manners of late—that, though I never did, to be ſure, love the man, yet one would contrive to keep up appearances. But really, of late, he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo indifferent, that one's lot is deplorable;—and—."</p>
               <p>This lady of faſhion now began to develope her intentions ſo openly, that Barnwell, whoſe ſoul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted with diſguſt at the diſcovery, would certainly have betrayed that diſguſt, but for a melancholy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, which diſcloſed a paſſion of a purer na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The love-ſick Maria had been permitted to ſit up that afternoon, as the violence of her fever was abated, though ſucceeded by a melancholy of the moſt painfully intereſting nature.</p>
               <p>She had expreſſed a wiſh to ſee Mrs. Emery, and her attendant accompanied her to the dreſſing-room. Her eyes were fixed on the floor, as ſhe entered,
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:038596_0248_1012A0C78CC9A6B0"/>
leaning on the arm of her attendant. She did not perceive Barnwell—</p>
               <p>"If you know he is very wicked, my dear Mrs. Emery," ſaid ſhe, "you ought to tell me; for how ſhould I have gueſſed at ſuch a thing—when his countenance was ſo full of goodneſs?—What a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver he muſt be! But don't you think he will grow tired of ſuch bad ways?—Poor young man!—well, well—all is for the beſt!"</p>
               <p>Mrs. Emery, burſting with anger and vexation at the interruption, was yet compelled to diſſemble.</p>
               <p>Barnwell, heſitating whether to go or ſtay, was pierced to the heart at the ſight of the lovely mourner. At the intimation of her nurſe, he concealed himſelf behind the door, as ſhe muſt have ſeen him had he retired.</p>
               <p>"My good girl," ſaid Mrs. Emery, "why do you leave your room?"</p>
               <p>"C," replied ſhe, "was ſo uneaſy, you can't think; for I can't help loving him:—and then, you know, theſe wicked women have ſuch arts to enſnare poor youth! And if any harm were to happen to him—why, then—Mrs. Emery, my poor head aches ſo very much, it makes me forget all that I was going to ſay. But, ſuppoſe I was to talk to him—only for his own good!—He would liſten to me.—I am very faint—and very ill—But he is well—that's a great happineſs to know he is well! I had ſomething to aſk you, but my poor head grows quite forgetful—So let us go, Nurſe—and we will pray for him—come, we will pray for him!"</p>
               <p>"Unfortunate girl!" exclaimed Mrs. Emery, when Maria had retired.</p>
               <p>"I am loſt in amazement!" interrupted Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. "To what can the dear ſufferer allude?"</p>
               <p>At that moment the trampling of horſes in the court yard announced the arrival of Mr. Freeman, who was expected, in conſequence of the ill ſtate of Miſs Freeman's health.</p>
               <p>Diſguſted at the conduct of Mrs. Emery, and at

the ſame moment filled with compaſſion for the amiable Maria, Barnwell met the reſpectable and worthy Mr. Freeman.</p>
               <p>"This, then is the end of my parting with her! Why did I truſt the ſtaff of my old age from my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ight? Shew me to my child!"</p>
               <p>In vain Mrs. Emery and her daughters urged the impropriety, and even danger, of the interview. The fond, afflicted father was deaf to reaſon, and would ſuffer no arguments to prevent him from embracing the object of all his love. Maria ſhrieked at the ſight of him—ran to his arms, and buried her face in his boſom. A fainting fit ſucceeded, in which, except for ſhort intervals, ſhe remained the whole night. The venerable old man would not quit the bed-ſide, but perſonally adminiſtered her medicines, and watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her countenance with unwearied attention.</p>
               <p>Another event, of the ſame evening, occaſioned Barnwell freſh food for conjecture, and ſome uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He had retired at the uſual our, and upon entering the breakfaſt room, the next morning, was ſurpriſed to find it empty. In a few minutes his ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe was increaſed, by the entrance of Mr. Rigby, in a pair of red ſlippers, his hair undreſſed, and his whole appearance indicating that he had ſlept in the houſe—</p>
               <p>—"There, my boy, as good as a prophet!" cried he, before Barnwell had recovered himſelf—"Knew it was upon the totter!—Saw it going—going—and now its <hi>gone!"</hi>
               </p>
               <p>"Sir!" ſaid Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"Tell you all about it. I was at Margate—charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſembly—fine girls—ſix belles to a beau—gives one conſequence—didn't chuſe to dance—an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ogling me—kept up my dignity—ſtrutted about the rooms—lounged among the card folks—flattered the old dowagers, and made them throw away their aces."</p>
               <p>"But what is all this?" ſaid Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"Coming to the point.—As I ſtood leaning, in a

pick tooth attitude, upon old Lady Snow-drop's chair, very attentive to a trick in diamonds, we were all frightened out of our wits by a ſudden exclamation of "D—n!!—as loud as the echo of Aſhley's double drums! I knew the voice—'Twas Emery's; every body was up, the cards were mixed, candles thrown down, and the whole room in complete con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation!—The tremendous word, that occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſuch an effect, was but the overture to the piece that ſucceeded; in which Emery, Middleton, a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the Guards, and the <hi>dear darling</hi> of an eminent diſtiller, were performers, both vocal and inſtrument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, their vociferations of abuſe being accompanied by the jarring of pokers, candleſticks, and chairs!"</p>
               <p>"Proceed, Sir," cried Barnwell: "if under all this embelliſhment there is any matter of fact—."</p>
               <p>"O, <hi>excuſez moi,</hi> my dear fellow—<hi>truth,</hi> to a word, on my honor, the antagoniſts were at laſt parted; the cauſe of diſpute was <hi>blown—foul play</hi>—The diſtiller's ſon had detected Middleton, at a time when ſome thouſands were againſt the former. Emery was charged as an accomplice. Swords and piſtols followed of courſe, and an immediate meeting was agreed on. Emery ſaw me, and entreated me to break the affair at home; and thus ends the firſt part of the chapter of accidents.</p>
               <p>"Are you in earneſt, Mr. Rigby?" ſaid Barnwell: "really in earneſt; <hi>ſerious</hi> I don't expect <hi>you</hi> to be."</p>
               <p>"<hi>Real right earneſt,</hi> upon my honor."</p>
               <p>"And where is Mr. Emery? Is he ſafe?"</p>
               <p>"<hi>Excuſez moi</hi>—can't ſay—Drove to town like furies—Juſtices had took the alarm, and would ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no meeting at Margate—'Twas quite a blaze—the whole town in an uproar."</p>
               <p>"The event is uncertain, then?" cried Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"Quite ſo. A <hi>bit</hi> or a <hi>miſs,</hi> that's the hazard."</p>
               <p>"And Mrs. Emery and the ladies—"</p>
               <p>"Have cried and fainted, and gone to ſleep."</p>
               <p>"Good God! what indifference about the life of a fellow-creature!" ſaid Barnwell; and, burſting

in anger from Rigby, learned from the ſervants that the moſt material part of his narrative was too true.—The ladies, in anxious expectation of tidings, remained in their room—whilſt Lord Morley and Mr. Eaſtwood had gone poſt to London.</p>
               <p>The moſt ſcrupulous care was taken to prevent a breath of this intelligence reaching the ears of Mr. Freeman, who ſtill kept watch by the bed-ſide of his daughter. All Ramſgate, however, rung with the ſtory, coloured and improved by every retailer. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>lew thick and faſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The houſe was beſet with inquirers; and Barnwell, fully occupied with at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Mrs. Emery and her daughters, and anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>politely</hi> curious inquiſitors, found it would be impoſſible to ſee Mental or Milwood that day, and therefore diſpatched a note, announcing the event.</p>
               <p>From the anſwer of Mental, he learned, that he had entered into a converſation with his daughter that morning, in which, as Mental expreſſed it, "he had diſcovered ſhe poſſeſſed a vigorous mind, a quick fancy, and ſome acquired knowledge; but when I gazed on her countenance," continued he, "my memory roſe in war againſt me; the image of her murdered mother ſtood before me, and I was compelled to fly the viſion. I have ſhut myſelf up in my chamber; I have reaſoned with the inward chid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of my ſoul; I have ſtruggled to obtain acquittal of myſelf, and found that ſtruggle hard. When late I ſtood upon the grave's brink, I was leſs ſhaken. I felt no pangs for an irretrievable act of homicide;—but the reſemblance grew upon me, faſtened on my mind, and conjured up the thouſand vain regrets I thought for ever buried. Thoſe gloomy thoughts, which I oft indulged at the ſtill midnight hour in the old Abbey's aiſle, now beſet me, and attract the mind from more uſeful occupations.

               <p>"From the window of my chamber, I ſee her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend a perſon, in a travelling dreſs, along the gravel walk to the wicket. Who is the Zelotti?—Come to me as ſoon as poſſible—Our ſituation becomes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting. MENTAL."</p>
               <p>Such was the concluſion of the letter Barnwell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Cottage.</p>
               <p>Many hours of anxiety were endured by Barnwell ere any certain intelligence was received concerning Mr. Emery. About ten at night Lord Morley and Mr. Eaſtwood returned.</p>
               <p>Mr. Emery had received a very ſevere wound in the head, and the ball was not extracted, at their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Portland Place. Captain Middleton had dangerouſly wounded his antagoniſt, and had ſet off immediately for Hamburgh.</p>
               <p>To conceal the danger of Mr. Emery's ſituation from his family, it was ſettled that they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for the preſent at Ramſgate, and be merely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that a meeting had taken place, and Mr. Emery ſlightly wounded, but forbid to travel for a day or two, when he would return to then.</p>
               <p>About noon the following day a poſt-chaiſe and ſour drove into the court-yard, and Mr. Drudge, the acting partner in the concern of Freeman, Emery, and Co. was in a few ſeconds in the hall. Barnwell received him.—</p>
               <p>—"Mr. Freeman!—Mr. Freeman!—Where's Mr. Freeman?—Let me ſee Mr. Freeman," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Mr. Drudge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="254" facs="unknown:038596_0253_1012A0D5E308F2C8"/>
The rattling of the chaiſe, the loud talking of Mr. Drudge, and the buſtle of the ſervants, alarmed the whole family, who, with Mr. Freeman himſelf, were immediately aſſembled, to inquire the occaſion of ſuch a noiſe. Soon as Mr. Drudge ſaw Mr. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he ran to him, and graſping his hand—</p>
               <p>"O, Sir!—prepare yourſelf—prepare yourſelf.—ſuch tidings!—ſuch diſcoveries!—Good God!"</p>
               <p>Mr. Freeman trembled—Mrs. Emery and the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies almoſt fainted—whilſt Lord Morley and Mr. Eaſtwood ſtood motionleſs, with a ſtupid ſtare of vacancy.</p>
               <p>"Is Mr. Emery dead?" exclaimed Barnwell.</p>
               <p>"O, worſe, worſe than death—He is a—ruined man!—and much I fear his ruin will extend to more than him. O, my dear Sir, when I think what <hi>you</hi> muſt feel!"—ſtill graſping Mr. Freeman's hand—.</p>
               <p>"Ruin!—ruin!" exclaimed the worthy Mr. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and, placing his hand to his forehead, cried—"Strengthen me, good heaven!"</p>
               <p>Lord Morley and Mr. Eaſtwood gaped at each other, and the reſt of the company; and the latter, at length, propoſed taking the ladies into another room, whilſt Mr. Drudge explained to Mr. Freeman. Barnwell remained.</p>
               <p>"Where is Mr. Emery?" cried Mr. Freeman.</p>
               <p>It now became neceſſary to acquaint him with the affair at Margate; and Mr. Drudge added—</p>
               <p>—"The report of ſuch conduct ſoon buzzed about London, and no leſs than ten arreſts were that morning iſſued againſt him; and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poor man is abſolutely delirious, from his wound, he has been removed to a ſpunging-houſe. In the houſe at Portland Place there are already four executions; as many in Broad Street, and at the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilion. Demands upon demands, to ſuch amounts that aſtoniſh me, flock ſo faſt one after another, that to procure bail is impoſſible; and reparation ſeems beyond the reach of human hands."</p>

                  <pb n="255" facs="unknown:038596_0254_1012A0D8089E2958"/>
Such was Mr. Drudge's unvarniſhed tale; and its effect upon the mind of Mr. Freeman may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but cannot be expreſſed.</p>
               <p>"For <hi>this</hi> have I nouriſhed thee—thou Ingrate!" exclaimed Mr. Freeman,—"Villain!—hypocrite!—ſmiling, ſyſtematic villain!!—What muſt be done? You, too honeſt man, the ſweat of whoſe brows have furniſhed this monſter with luxuries—you, too, muſt be involved in his ruin!"</p>
               <p>"To be ſure I muſt ſuffer—my wife and children muſt ſuffer!" ſaid Mr. Drudge. "But, O, Sir, <hi>I</hi> am a young man yet; but <hi>you,</hi> you Sir—who have grown old in the reſpect of the world, and have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a right to the comforts of age—<hi>you,</hi> Sir, muſt be a ſufferer, indeed!—Your amiable daughter too—."</p>
               <p>"Hold, hold, hold!" cried Freeman: <hi>"there</hi> you touch my ſoul! But how can he ſo long have deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us both?"</p>
               <p>"Alas! Sir, <hi>I</hi> have long ſuſpected when balance after balance has been againſt us; but he was ſo ready with ſpecious excuſes. At one time he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended money was locked up in the hands of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; at another, ſpeculations of the boldeſt nature in the funds; and as they had all your ſanction—."</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>"My</hi> ſanction!—I never dreamt of ſuch proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Month after month he remitted to me ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the concerns, that ſhewed an <hi>increaſing,</hi> very increaſing balance in our favor."</p>
               <p>"Good God, what villainy!—Sir, he has repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, again and again, aſſured me you knew the facts, and approved them; while, at the ſame moment, he muſt have been remitting for your inſpection, ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his own fabrication."</p>
               <p>"Can human nature be ſo baſe!" ſaid Mr. Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. "But what can be done? How are we to learn the amount of debts againſt us?"</p>
               <p>"A meeting muſt be inſtantly called," ſaid Mr. Drudge.</p>
               <p>"O, juſt Heaven, help me to ſupport it!—At

my time of life, muſt I, after having ſo many years enjoyed the good opinion of my brother merchants, muſt I now be reduced to ſtand down-caſt before my creditors, and own myſelf connected with a ſwindler? How ſhall I bear it?—[Tears actually rolled down his cheeks."]—"Had he buried a dagger in my heart, it had been mercy, to a deed like this!"</p>
               <p>Barnwell, who trembled for the effects of this <hi>ſtoppage</hi> upon his own crime, was ſcarcely able to ſpeak; yet the tears of ſuch a man as Mr. Freeman rouſed him to attempt ſomething like conſolation.</p>
               <p>"Not on you, Sir," ſaid he, "not on you will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace fall, whoſe actions—"</p>
               <p>"The world, in theſe caſes, ſeldom diſcriminates, young man. What will my tenants, my neighbours ſay, when my houſe, my lands, my very furniture, is lotted out for ſale, to pay my creditors, perhaps a fourth, an eighth, of their juſt debts?—And you, too my Maria—poor dear girl!"—[He dropped on his knees] "Take her—take her, gracious God, to thine own kingdom! Let her not riſe from the bed of ſickneſs to a beggar's lot!"</p>
               <p>A conſiderable time paſſed before this injured merchant could, with any compoſure, diſcuſs what ſteps ſhould be adopted. At length it was agreed to ſummon a meeting of their creditors. When this was arranged—</p>

                  <hi>"Mrs. Emery."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus fled theſe <hi>ſummer friends,</hi> at the firſt blaſt of wintery adverſity. How different the conduct of the worthy Sir James Barnwell! Soon as he had peruſed Mr. Eaſtwood's note, he repaired to the houſe of mourning; nor did the heart-felt ſorrow which ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him on his nephew's account, prevent him from tendering every conſolation in his power to the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Emery's.</p>
               <p>Theſe ladies felt the change of circumſtances ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely indeed. Mother and daughters ſo reſembled each other in their feelings, that one deſcription ſerves each and all. Uneducated in any true principles of religion or morality, they had borne proſperity too ill to ſuſtain adverſity with fortitude. When they were ſurrounded by the luxuries and dainties of life, and ſeemed placed on an eminence above the reach of want, or woe, they had never been taught to reflect upon the means, by which they were thus exalted, whilſt millions of their fellow-creatures <hi>ſtruggled</hi> to endure exiſtence: they never reflected, it was that chance "in the affairs of men" which gave <hi>them</hi> wealth, and <hi>others</hi> want; but vainly arrogating to themſelves a viſionary ſuperiority in the ſcale of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings, called not the poor their brethren. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead,
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:038596_0260_10122DE60B00F0B8"/>
therefore, of alleviating the conſequences of that inequality in ſociety (which experience ſeems to pronounce inevitable) the occupation of their lives was to increaſe that ſplendor, which dazzled—but never cheered the poor! The feelings of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, the impulſe of charity, the glow of ſenſibility, are words they may have heard, but emotions they had never felt. How pitiable, then, their preſent ſituation. In an inſtant that pinnacle, on which they were exalted, ſinks; and from affluence to poverty is but the journey of an hour. The ſentiments they had imbibed continue; and, judging from their own feelings, they conſider themſelves, of courſe, objects of contempt to the rich; whilſt, at the ſame time, fallen pride is naturally the ridicule of the poor.</p>
               <p>The benevolent Knight in vain offered conſolation to minds the victims of childiſh fretfulneſs:—ſobs, tears, and fits ſucceeding fits, prevented the voice of reaſon from approaching their ears. Turning, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, from ſo vain an effort, he rendered them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to themſelves, a moſt eſſential ſervice.</p>
               <p>The proprietor of the ready furniſhed houſe they occupied, had expreſſed, in his hearing, his wiſh they ſhould quit his premiſes, as he ſaw no chance of ever being paid. Sir James became reſponſible, and the landlord became quiet.—Meanwhile, he had not neglected any ſteps immediately neceſſary for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of his nephew. Hand-bills were printed, and brought home, deſcribing his perſon and dreſs, and were about to be circulated, when a fiſherman brought a letter, 'which,' he ſaid, 'a ſtrange young gentleman wrote, at a public houſe in Sandwich, where he was, and gave him a crown to bring it to this houſe.' It bore this direction—'Let any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, except the ſervants, open it.—G. B.'</p>
               <p>Sir James broke the ſeal, and read as follows:—</p>

enough to hint it to either, muſt anſwer for the moſt dreadful conſequences.—A day—only a day, of two at moſt, he begs, upon his knees, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment of this act.—If he returns not by to-morrow night—diſcovery <hi>muſt</hi> take place—for he will return ere then—or never!—Any attempts to diſcover him, now, will be fatal.

               <p>Whilſt Sir James held this note in his hand, and juſt as he wiped a tear from his eyes, entered Mr. Sandall. He had heard the ſtate of Mr. Emery's af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and accordingly followed his patron to enjoy the whole, true, and full account, as a moſt ample meal of ſcandal, upon which poiſonous food he loved to gormandize.</p>
               <p>Obſequiouſly cringing, as he held the door in his hand—"I fear, Sir James, I intrude—I—."</p>
               <p>"O, Mr. Sandall," cried the knight, "my poor nephew—Read—read!"</p>
               <p>"Alas, alas!" ſaid Sandall, when he had peruſed it. "Ay, this is always the end of ſuch fiery, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable youths. I was afraid what would be his conduct, ever ſince he ſo obſtinately reſiſted our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments upon apparitions;—there was too much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring, doubting, hereſy, about that youth; and then, his connecting himſelf with that impious, athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical Illuminati, Mental; for I have proofs that he is one; or elſe what could be the meaning of his myſtic coffin lid, and his ſkull, and his nightly orgies in the abbey?"</p>
               <p>"Silence—ſilence," cried Sir James. "You judge too quickly to judge impartially. May it not prove that ſome youthful indiſcretions have brought on embarraſſments, of which he is aſhamed?—But what can he mean by a day or two's concealment? So <hi>ſuddenly</hi> to leave the houſe, too—It is all extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary!"</p>
               <p>"It <hi>is</hi> extraordinary," ſaid Sandall, who never dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered many moments from his patron's opinion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="263" facs="unknown:038596_0262_10122E1F68FB7C50"/>
"To acquaint his mother with the affair at preſent, would be cruel."</p>

               <p>"And would anſwer no end," ſaid Sir James.</p>
               <p>"No end at all," rejoined Sandall.</p>
               <p>The reſult of their deliberations was, to continue their ſearch and inquiries after the poor fugitive, and at leaſt, for a day or two, to keep his mother and ſiſter ignorant of the event.</p>

                     <p>Haſten, haſten on the wings of mighty Miſchief!—Events are rapidly ſucceeding each other, of high and intereſting import. There are materials now ready to our hands, Zelotti, of which thy matchleſs talents might frame fabrics of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licity for thy Milwood, that will exiſt with her exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. In plain terms, there is wealth ready to be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, that ſhall furniſh all the goods of exiſtence, all the pleaſures, enjoyments, and voluptuouſneſs of living, as long as I ſhall live.</p>
                     <p>This will meet you, I hope, near my preſent humble cottage. I intend it merely as a plan of the camp you are entering. The ſtranger is rich, I am convinced beyond all doubt. There lie in a chair, by his bed-ſide, two packets, ſealed; only part of their
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:038596_0263_10122E4F9F5DB960"/>
contents were, therefore, viſible to the prying eye. I could diſcover enough, however, to know that Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well is the ſole poſſeſſor of his wealth after his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe; and the words "eſtates in Hertfordſhire, jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, caſh, &amp;c." I could catch half glimpſes of. On the ſame chair is a caſket, doubtleſs the repoſitory of theſe jewels. My hand is eager for the blow, Zelotti!</p>
                     <p>From old Townly, let me lead you to another character.—Emery has thrown his die, and loſt!—We ever, you know, concluded that would be the caſe. Half villains and half wits never thrive in this planet of the ſyſtem.—Perhaps they may do better, ſhould they hereafter tenant the <hi>moon!</hi> Middleton too, rejoice with me, my friend, Middleton, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to fly the kingdom, whilſt Emery, whom he has long made his ſtaff of life, is reduced to beggary. This is all well—this is a moſt delicious draught for the thirſt of proud revenge! But it ſhall not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicate the ſober Milwood. No, Zelotti;—'twere but a puny gratification for a mind like mine, did it end here; but mark the conſequences:—The forged acceptance of five hundred pounds, on which our tool Blackmore advanced me three, you recollect he was to reſerve in his own poſſeſſion till nearly due; but the needy rogue broke his promiſe, and diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to ſome Jew, or, in other words, ſold it for three hundred and eighty.—This bill naturally enough, was ſuſpected, and Blackmore was acquainted of the circumſtance. This diſcovery, and the dread of ſome others, gave wings to the man of law, and by this time he is on his voyage to America. The boy Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, terrified beyond all meaſure at this diſcovery, fled from his friends, like a lunatic, the moment he heard it; and having rambled the whole of this day without food, by ſecret paths, and under cover of the night, arrived here about an hour ago. Of all the compoſitions of human nature, that I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſtudied, he is by far the neareſt to that ſtandard, which is called good in ſociety: of courſe the beſt
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:038596_0264_10122EF76BB06320"/>
adapted to our purpoſe; for, do we not know, Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotti, that the wicked are wary? Had Barnwell brought with him, to Berners Street, polluted paſſions, would he ſo eaſily have fallen our victim?—Had Barnwell been in the habit of diſſembling, would he have ſcrupled to have told ſome varniſhed tale to Emery, as an excuſe for borrowing three hundred pounds? Or, had his heart been caſed in adamant, as Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's, as our's, as half mankind's are, would he have committed himſelf to the riſk of death to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved another's life? O, never!—But, no matter by what means we have enſnared him; he is now as completely in my power as my heart can wiſh. I am not altogether ſorry you are not here, till I have diſpoſed of him. He is concealed in the chamber which muſt be your's.—Moſt fortunately for us, he refuſes to ſee old Townley, and begs earneſtly that he may not be acquainted with his arrival.</p>
                     <p>Nor is this all:—as if chance itſelf had eſpouſed our cauſe, it has directed, juſt at this momentous criſis, Barnwell's uncle to Ramſgate, who has taken up his reſidence at the houſe where Emery reſided. This event has filled me with ambitious, bold deſires!</p>
                     <p>What think you, Zelotti; is it not poſſible to combine our ſchemes, and by a <hi>double</hi> blow accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the diſmiſſal of Townley and old Barnwell both? 'Twould be a glorious atchievement, and its reſult would be a conſonant reward.—Huſh! * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 'Twas Barnwell ſtealing from his chamber; he tapped at my door, and I had juſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient time to conceal my letter, when he entered, more like a ſpectre than a man—his hair diſhevelled, his eyes red with weeping, his cheeks and lips pale as Conſumption. Speechleſs, he tottered towards my chair, and ſeated himſelf on the floor at my feet, reclining his head on my lap.</p>
                     <p>As old Townley ſleeps in the room above, I dared not ſuffer him to ſpeak—I forced him to ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low a cordial, and have prevailed on him to throw himſelf upon the bed. He ſlumbers; but his mind,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:038596_0265_10122F43FA54C128"/>
even in ſleep, is haunted. At intervals he pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces "Milwood' ſo loudly, that if old Townley 'wakes, he muſt ſurely hear it. At other times he calls upon his mother, his Eliza, and has this moment uttered, in a voice of agony, "Father, father!—ſave me, ſave me!"—</p>
                     <p>If theſe powerful effects follow the dread of a detection of forgery, a common reaſoner would ſay, there is but poor hope that we ſhall compel him to murder. That very dread, however, is the baſis of my hope—I'll keep him the whole of to-morrow in my own room, ſo that the chamber is ready for your reception.—The light of to-morrow's ſun will ſhew me my Zelotti. Remember your part, and I will devote the whole of this night to the ſtudy of mine.</p>

               <p>In the meanwhile Mental paſſed his hours moſt unpleaſantly. His ſituation became torture. He was placed under the ſame roof with his own, his only child; but every opportunity of converſe which he ſnatched, all the obſervations he could form, tended to confirm him more and more in the opinion, that this child was loſt to virtue for ever! Deſpairing, therefore, for the ſucceſs of any attempts towards her reformation, he that morning reſolved to remove from the cottage, without making himſelf known.</p>
               <p>Ignorant of thoſe important events which had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken place at Mr. Emery's, he began to murmur at the abſence of Barnwell, and hinted his intention of inquiring for him at Mr. Emery's, if he did not call in the courſe of that morning. This ſtep Milwood
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:038596_0266_10122F45986B82B8"/>
determined to prevent.—About noon Zelotti arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Mental was in the parlour when he entered, and Milwood introduced them to each other.</p>
               <p>The perſon and manners of this Italian were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely prepoſſeſſing, and in a very few minutes he found means to entangle Mental in a converſation, in ſpite of the general taciturnity of the latter. Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal was, perhaps, in ſome degree, induced to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation by the curioſity he felt concerning Zelotti; but the Italian was too wary to allow the leaſt poſſible clue to his real character to eſcape him. Mental perceived, however, that Zelotti was no common man.</p>
               <p>The firſt employment of Zelotti, after a conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation with Milwood, was to aſſume the diſguiſe of a fiſherman, and <hi>reconnoitre</hi> Mr. Emery's late reſidence. He was admitted to the preſence of the almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted uncle of Barnwell. His olive complexion helped his diſguiſe, and he ſpoke Engliſh very well.</p>
               <p>"I believe I am right," ſaid the impoſtor; "you are the maſter, as I take it, of one George Barnwell.'</p>
               <p>"No, no," cried Sir James, "I am his uncle: Where is he?—Where is my nephew?'</p>
               <p>"That is more than I muſt tell."</p>
               <p>"But you ſhall be compelled to tell."</p>
               <p>"No, Sir; I am poor, and roughly finiſhed; but I have never yet, nor I never will, betray my truſt."</p>
               <p>"But 'tis for his intereſt, 'tis for his happineſs alone, I wiſh to know. Take me, then, to the poor diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted youth, and he himſelf will bleſs you for it to the lateſt hour of his life."</p>
               <p>"It muſt not be—I have ſworn an oath, your honour, a ſacred, ſolemn oath, that I would not utter a word that might lead to his diſcovery."</p>
               <p>"What is the purpoſe of your errand, then?"</p>
               <p>"This, your honour—to ſay, that he will either come home to night, or elſe that he will write a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but being much afraid his abſence might be blazed abroad, he wanted much to be aſſured that his mother nor his uncle were apprized of it."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="268" facs="unknown:038596_0267_10122DDFF2262E38"/>
"His mother and ſiſter are yet ignorant of it; and if he would return immediately, they might never know it. I have letters to deliver from them; but being ignorant of their contents, I know not how they might affect him."</p>
               <p>"I'll anſwer for it, they will be the means of haſtening his return; beſides, your honour, if you were to ſend them, and ſome kind meſſage from yourſelf, I'd back it to the beſt of my power. Whilſt he is at my hut no harm ſhall come to him; and either I, or Margery, my dame, have always our eyes upon him. When he leaves us I'll ſee, too, that he goes no where but to this houſe."</p>
               <p>"Will you promiſe to do this—will you, on your oath, promiſe to do this?" ſaid the knight.—"And do you really think he will come to-night?"</p>
               <p>"I do, I do," cried Zelotti.</p>
               <p>"Then, here, honeſt fellow, take him th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Tell him, that if he will return to me this night, all that has paſt ſhall be kept ſecret for ever—tell him, in ſhort, good man, whatever you think can induce his return; and, depend on it, your reward ſhall not be ſmall" [Sir James was untying his purſe.]</p>
               <p>"Put up your purſe, your honour," cried Zelotti; "the pleaſure of carrying ſuch a kind meſſage to heal his poor broken heart, is reward enough to Ned Martin."</p>
               <p>He retired.—Sir James's heart was lightened conſiderably by the hope which this impoſtor occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, and he wrote to his ſiſter-in-law, and his niece, to appriſe them of the change in his old friend Mr. Freeman's affairs, and ſlightly mentioned that his nephew was well; but much employed in conſequence of the unfortunate alteration in the circumſtances of his friends.</p>

               <p>UPON the return of Zelotti, conference was held betwixt that ſubtle Italian and Milwood, the reſult of which was the following conduct:—</p>
               <p>Barnwell had made her chamber his priſon. It was nearly dark when Milwood, confuſion and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>may pictured in her countenance, ruſhed into the apartment, and locked the door.</p>
               <p>"Barnwell!" exclaimed ſhe, "Barnwell! arouſe yourſelf, or we are loſt for ever!"</p>
               <p>The unhappy Barnwell, almoſt ſtupified with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, ſat on a chair, his legs placed on a window-ſeat, reclining his head on his hand, like one inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.—He noticed nothing that ſhe ſaid. She ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached him, took his hand in her's, and gazed full in his face.—</p>
               <p>"O, Milwood! that face—thoſe eyes—were they deſigned by nature to accompliſh ſuch wide ruin? Poor Eliza! poor mother!"</p>
               <p>There was ſuch a ſettled wildneſs in his eyes, that Milwood doubted, for a moment, whether he was ſenſible. After ſome time, a deep ſigh was followed by a flood of tears, which ſeemed greatly to relieve him.</p>
               <p>"Come, come; for ſhame," ſaid ſhe," conquer theſe unmanly vapours; ſummon the energy of your mind; it is now, Barnwell, you need it. This weak, puerile dejection, is ruinous and diſgraceful. Arouſe, Barnwell, arouſe!—think what you owe to the law of nature—your own defence—think what you owe the dignity of your nature, and ſcorn to crawl thus, on captive knees, beneath the iron ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre of imperious fate. Such baſe yielding ill becomes
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:038596_0269_10122F4A0C616F00"/>
the man of mind, of ſovereignty of ſoul—it ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes my Barnwell. Arm yourſelf, then, with the intrepidity of manhood, and ſtruggle to the laſt gaſp with fate, till death or triumph end the ſtrife."</p>
               <p>"Alas! what is there more to be atchieved? Do not the ſwift feet of Juſtice hunt me? Does not her outſtretched arm hold over my devoted head the ſword of death? What have I, then, to do, but to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit?"</p>
               <p>"Cowardly, grovelling notion! Why, a poor rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile outcaſt of ſociety, a being riſing ſcarcely any thing in intellect above the worm we tread on, a petty common thief, trembling beneath the ſhadow of his gibbet, could not concede a meaner, more humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting confeſſion. And ſhall Barnwell ſneak thus like a reptile to his hole, and die? O, whither are thy feelings fled? Where are the powers of thy memory? What, tamely yield yourſelf to a felon's fate—chains, public infamy, and public death? Look at the effects of ſuch conduct on others—Behold the pale, death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like form that gave you life—gaze on her agonies—ſee how ſhe rends her grey hairs—how ſhe mangles thoſe breaſts that have nurtured thee! See, too, a beauteous ſiſter falling, in the bloom of life, a victim to thy diſgraceful fate!—while I—"</p>
               <p>"Hold, Milwood, as you value my exiſtence!—If thus you paint the horrors that await me, no ſtrength of reaſon, no ſuggeſtions of moral duty, will prevent me from inſtant ſuicide. Surely I was born for the accurſed purpoſe of inflicting tortures on thoſe I love!—But ſpare me the painful picture. In my heart, in my brain, the impreſſion of all theſe horrors is fixed with unutterable anguiſh!"—</p>
               <p>"You feel all theſe horrors, you ſay; yet who can believe it? You make no ſingle effort to avert them—Inſenſible to the dangers that threaten us, tamely you indulge a fruitleſs ſorrow."</p>
               <p>"Is it not <hi>impoſſible</hi> to eſcape thoſe dangers?"</p>
               <p>"It is poſſible not to endure them."</p>

               <p>"Milwood, you dare not meditate ſuch miſchief!" ſaid Barnwell, ſeizing her hand. "O, here, in this breaſt, rather plunge the weapon! Why ſhould you bleed for my crimes—why—O, my brain burns—I am giddy with madneſs of thought!"</p>
               <p>"Of what does Barnwell think <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Surely he muſt think fear of death is an ingredient in her compoſition, if he ſuppoſes ſhe can undergo, with coward patience, the ſolemn mockeries of funereal preparations, aſcend a ſcaffold, face a multitude, and bear the tortures of ſuperſtitious rites and ceremonies, merely for a <hi>little</hi> longer life. No, ſince we muſt die, let us, like Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, meet the blow, rather than wait the lingering ſtroke of <hi>ſyſtematic</hi> murder."</p>

               <p>"And is it not ſo? Do you imagine that, in our preſent condition, there is a poſſibility of our eſcape? Have I—have you—ten pounds in our poſſeſſion?

Barnwell ſhuddered with horror; his whole maſs of blood ſeemed, in a moment, congealed; the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of death ſeized his limbs, and the features of his face were worked up to phrenſy.</p>
               <p>"Thou a woman?" exclaimed he, "a woman! No—no—no—thou art ſome ſpirit of the grand ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of mankind, permitted to aſſume this lovely form, to blaſt the peace of families, to ſever the hearts of mother, ſiſter, ſon and brother, from each other; to drain the human heart of its own natural affections, and in their place implant a poiſonous luſt, that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates a chilling apathy to all but thine accurſed ſelf: that wars with all that is good and amiable in ſociety, that ſtirs rebellion againſt God himſelf, prompts the deſpairing ſoul to the laſt damning act of ſin, and bears it, with a horrid yell of triumph, to ſcenes of endleſs torture and deſpair!"</p>
               <p>In the extreme of agony, the loſt youth tore his hair, threw himſelf upon the floor, and abandoned himſelf to the violence of his deſpair!</p>
               <p>Milwood, with the malice and art of a daemon, ſilently contemplated the progreſs of her operations. She ſuffered him to exhauſt the violence of his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and ſat covering her face with her handkerchief. After ſome time, Barnwell, raiſing his eyes from the floor, beheld her in tears.</p>
               <p>What is that potent, moſt myſterious influence, to which is given the name of Love? Say, ye, who aim at defining all the influences and operations of our nature, who preſume to have diſcovered cauſes for all the actions of men—how is it, that a being, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with more than the common powers of reaſon, whoſe heart has been fenced with the leſſons of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſhould, by the influence of this moſt powerful paſſion, be impelled to the commiſſion of deeds, at which, when that influence ceaſes to operate, his heart recoils with horror, and his reaſon ſurveys with aſtoniſhment?</p>
               <p>Barnwell ſaw her tears; they were like burning drops upon his own heart—he aroſe—he flew to the diſſembler.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="unknown:038596_0272_10122F50F8BC3350"/>
"Milwood, Milwood! you weep—you are wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—and I have made you ſo!"</p>
               <p>"You have, indeed," ſaid ſhe. O, unkind—O, cruel! But I deſerve it—yes, I deſerve it, Barnwell; but could I have imagined <hi>you,</hi> of all men, would thus heap reproaches upon the poor heart o'er which you have triumphed! O, no—the taunts of ſociety, the ſcorn of my own ſex, the deriſion of yours—theſe I expected, Barnwell; but that <hi>you</hi> ſhould revile me—that <hi>you</hi> ſhould—O! 'tis this overcomes me!"</p>
               <p>She wept, and her whole ſoul ſeemed melted into woe. Barnwell, irreſolute and wavering in his mind, was at a loſs in what language to addreſs her. She continued—</p>
               <p>"If our fates have proved calamitous; if evil, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing on the heels of evil, purſues us, how am I to blame? Did <hi>I</hi> requeſt that ſecond fatal interview, the ſource of all our woes? Was I not prepared to leave forever the iſle which you inhabited? Have I received an intereſt or a pleaſure ſeparate from yours, ſince that ill-fated hour? And yet I am arraigned as guilty of intentional crimes. O, youth! lovely, yet unfortunate, be juſt, even amid your ſufferings. Why have I offered the antidote of death to the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries that threaten?—becauſe I knew you timid, ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly heſitating; when the only means of eſcaping them are bold, enterpriſing, and uncommon; ſuch as, indeed, are above the uſe of beings educated in the prejudices and errors of ſyſtems; ſuch as I know you could never be brought to uſe; and, therefore, we muſt die!"</p>
               <p>"Die!" exclaimed Barnwell; "you—you muſt die? O, God, forbid!—Let us fly—let us fly this inſtant, Milwood! I begin to ſee your horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition" (putting his hand to his forehead.) "Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Heaven!—Milwood, why did <hi>you</hi> concern your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the accurſed forgery?—O, forgive my mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when I accuſed you. Where is—where is my friend—where is Townley? I muſt ſee him, or it will be too late—perhaps it is already too late to eſcape

our purſuers.—He will give me any ſum of money we may want—Let me go to him."</p>
               <p>"Alas! my Barnwell," cried Milwood, prepared for this propoſal, "hope nothing there. He left the cottage this morning early, as he ſaid, on urgent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and will not return till to-morrow: by that period our fate will be decided."</p>
               <p>"<hi>Our</hi> fate, Milwood! No, no, <hi>you</hi> muſt not ſuffer. On me—on me, juſt Heaven, pour thy vengeance! But has not my friend left his caſket?—I know its value—I know your right to it."</p>
               <p>"You talk wildly, my Barnwell! But even had we the right you ſpeak of, we have not the power; the caſket is not here.'</p>
               <p>"Did he not ſay whither he was gone?"</p>
               <p>"No."</p>
               <p>"Did he ever converſe with you on any ſubjects beſides common ones? Did he ever make any diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, or throw out any hints?"</p>
               <p>"No—no—none—but let us not waſte time now inwords, when every moment that eſcapes us brings the criſis of our ſate ſtill nearer."</p>
               <p>"You are calm, Milwood!—Ah! then, I know your reſolution—Give me that dagger."</p>
               <p>"No, Barnwell; 'tis the laſt wreck of hope that's left to cling to."</p>
               <p>The diſtracted youth now raved again—all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments of the ſiren, all the high-wrought pictur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of memory, burſt at once on his imagination. She was every thing to him, in this moment of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation from himſelf. All other exiſtence was to him as though it exiſted not; and to contemplate the deſtruction of this idol of his ſoul, or rather the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of this eſſence of his own exiſtence, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the efforts of his reaſon. He ſunk ſenſeleſs on her boſom.—</p>
               <p>"O, were there any means, however deſperate, however dangerous, by which I might ſave you, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood!" ſaid he, after ſome time.</p>
               <p>"There is a way, Barnwell; but it is a track un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:038596_0274_10122F56579E91E0"/>
by vulgar footſteps: the great of ſoul alone walk in this path—the votaries of ambition, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and all the higher, nobler propenſities of our nature. Men of low and grovelling impulſes tremble at its entrance, and turn aſide, ſeeking each little pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty avenue of cowardly eſcape, while thoſe of higher daring, boldly tread the paths of blood!"</p>
               <p>"Go on," cried Barnwell: "I underſtand you."</p>
               <p>"If he—who holds the fatal paper, which is to witneſs againſt us to our death—if he and you, Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, were in ſome retired ſpot, far from the prying y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Milwood, there is a deſperate meaning in your words—<hi>Know</hi> you <hi>who</hi> holds the bill?"</p>
               <p>"I do."</p>
               <p>"Is he ſome villain—ſome uſurious ſhark, that has long preyed upon the diſtreſſes of his fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?—Say, is he a father, or a huſband? Would his death—O, whither am I wandering?"</p>
               <p>In the road to ſafety—to future years of peace and joy—had you but the courage of a man. You have diſcovered, Barnwell, the <hi>only</hi> avenue of eſcape from death. Think on't, man: Does not the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture loudly call on you to act? If, in the highway, another meet you with ſome deadly weapon, and threaten your deſtruction, what is the impulſe nature gives? Here is but trifling difference—An inſtrument of death—no matter what—is in the hands of one who threatens you, and in you, all who love you, with deſtruction! If, then, by a blow that nature prompts, you can diſarm your foe—Barnwell, do you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me?"</p>
               <p>He had fixed his eyes, which had a death-like glaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy appearance, firmly on Milwood—his hands were clenched tightly together, and reſted on his knees.</p>
               <p>"Milwood," ſaid he, continuing in the ſame poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, "Milwood, I have taken a deſperate reſolve!—Who had dared have told me, a few months ago, that I ſhould prove a murderer! But I ſhall—ay, you ſhall live, Milwood, in mirth and jollity: After theſe hands

               <p>This was not the preciſe diſpoſition to which ſhe had aimed to bring him. There was a wildneſs in his manner, bordering ſo nearly on inſanity, that ſhe trembled with the apprehenſion, that he might betray their purpoſe.</p>
               <p>"This is the rant of madneſs," cried ſhe; "not the deciſion of courage."</p>
               <p>"By Heaven, I'll do it! I have diſmiſſed that trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome gueſt that has hitherto daunted my courage—it is fled—fled for ever. I have now no conſcience, but thy voice, my love. Come, let us to action—Where does the old villain dwell?"</p>
               <p>"Be more yourſelf, Barnwell—you rave."</p>
               <p>"No, by my ſoul, I am calm! Come, give me my victim—ſee the moon riſes, and the hour of foul deeds draws nigh."</p>
               <p>Milwood pauſed—ſhe meditated—ſhe ſaw his ſoul wound up to deſperation, and ripe for the deed ſhe wiſhed concluded; but, ever wary in her deſigns, ſhe looked beyond the deed, and ſaw his ſtate of mind ill calculated for its concealment, when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. She pauſed again—ſhe recollected, that there is a criſis in mental operations, and knew, that if ſhe ſuffered this criſis of deſperation to arrive, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out accompliſhing her end, it never would return. She well knew the ſtate of languor that would ſucceed it, and, with a boldneſs of determination, reſolved upon the riſk. When ſhe had reſolved, ſhe took his hands, ſhe kiſſed them, bathed them with tears, and called him by the deareſt title of Saviour.</p>
               <p>"Every hour of my future exiſtence will be a gift of thine,' ſaid ſhe; "to thee, my ſaviour, ſhall I owe all the years of life I may enjoy. But, are you firm, my hero?"</p>
               <p>"I am reſolved."</p>
               <p>"But when you ſhall hear <hi>who</hi> is the victim, the neceſſary victim, for whom Fate calls—O, then, all my hopes of life will vaniſh! You will prefer his life to mine, to a mother's, a ſiſter's, to your own!"</p>

                  <pb n="277" facs="unknown:038596_0276_10122F5B0BDC6080"/>
"No—no—no," cried he; "were my father liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and in the way 'twixt life and you, I <hi>think</hi>—yes, I <hi>think,</hi> I ſhould, Milwood—!"</p>
               <p>"But you have a near relation, who yet lives, Barnwell—you have an—"(ſhe held his hand graſp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tightly in her own) "an—an—Uncle!"</p>
               <p>"Is it my poor uncle, then?—O!"</p>
               <p>He ſtruck his head violently.—She ſuffered him to remain ſilent a few minutes, and then, in a moſt tender voice—</p>
               <p>"Barnwell, ſpeak to me—tell me—am I to die?"</p>
               <p>He threw himſelf into her arms.</p>
               <p>"Live, Milwood, live!—though perdition, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting perdition, be the price of your exiſtence!"</p>
               <p>From this moment he was loſt. The ſituation of his uncle at Mr. Emery's was made known to him; ſhe purſuaded him that the forged bill had paſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his poſſeſſion; that, ignorant who had forged it, he ſtill held it; and, if he lived, muſt, in ſpite of every wiſh to the contrary, be compelled to appear againſt them.</p>

               <p>SIR James Barnwell had juſt finiſhed a ſolitary ſupper, when Barnwell, attended by Zelotti, rung the bell at the gate of the court yard. The pride of Mrs. Emery and her daughter, confined them to their chambers; the poor Maria was entruſted to the care of a nurſe; and Mr. Sandall was gone to viſit a friend at Margate.</p>
               <p>The pretended fiſherman introduced Barnwell to his rejoicing uncle, who fell on his neck, and embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him. Barnwell, pale and trembling, ſeated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſilently on a chair, and ſupported his head by lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:038596_0277_10122F5D3215A7C0"/>
his elbow on the table. Zelotti, in a whiſper to Sir James, obſerved, that the leſs notice was taken of him, and the earlier they retired, the better, and then departed. The anguiſh of the old man, as he looked upon his nephew, was keen indeed.</p>
               <p>"You look ill, my nephew; you are fatigued. We will not enter on the cauſe of your uneaſineſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; but if your happineſs can be reſtored by any means in my power, aſſure yourſelf of my beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors."</p>
               <p>"You are very good—yes, you are <hi>truly</hi> good—and that's one comfortable reflection," ſaid Barnwell.</p>
               <p>Sir James little ſuſpected the drift of his diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>"Have you ſupped, George?"</p>
               <p>"I have not eat, a long while, Sir; my appetite is gone, quite gone—but I can drink—what have you there, wine?"</p>
               <p>The wine was on the table; he drank a bumper greedily.</p>
               <p>"You don't inquire after your mother, or your ſiſter, George."</p>
               <p>"O, true! you're right—my mother—ah, my mother—and Eliza—poor girl!—Come, Sir, won't you take ſome wine?"</p>
               <p>Sir James was alarmed at his wild manner. Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well poured out another bumper, and ſwallowed it.</p>
               <p>"How much does it want to one o'clock?" ſaid he.</p>
               <p>"'Tis not twelve," ſaid Sir James.</p>
               <p>At that inſtant Mr. Sandall entered the room. Sir James intimated ſilence to him. Barnwell look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at him, but did not notice him.</p>
               <p>"What an altered houſe is this!" ſaid Barnwell. "No more merriment!—Well, I muſt to bed—and you, Mr. Sandall, being a divine, will pray for us all—Uncle, do you pray every night?"</p>
               <p>Sir James, who conceived his brain injured, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured him, and anſwered him—"Always, George."</p>
               <p>"I am glad of that," ſaid he; "you are a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man, and your prayers are heard."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="279" facs="unknown:038596_0278_10122F5F584DD8F8"/>
He rung for the ſervant. At the door he turned round and ſtood with his eyes fixed ſome time on his uncle, then retired, ſaying, as he left the room, "God bleſs you, Sir—good night."</p>
               <p>When the man had attended him to his chamber door, which was one, among ſeveral, in a long gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery—"There poor Miſs Freeman ſleeps—does ſhe not, Sam?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir."</p>
               <p>"And in that room, I ſuppoſe, my uncle ſleeps."</p>
               <p>"No, Sir, the other gentleman has that room—Sir James lies in this <hi>here,</hi> next to your's."</p>
               <p>"Does that clock, that ſtands at the end of the gallery, ſtrike the hours, Sam?"</p>
               <p>"Yes, Sir."</p>
               <p>"Do the lamps at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>"Yes, Sir, till near day light."</p>
               <p>"Good night, Sam."</p>
               <p>He retired to his chamber. The clock ſtruck twelve.—"One hour more!" exclaimed he. He paced about the chamber in agony of thought.—"Huſh!" murmured he to himſelf, "I hear his aged footſteps—he paſſes my door—he enters his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Will he lock the door?—no—he dreads the danger of fire, and rather truſts to man's mercy than a ſenſeleſs element! Hark! he prays—Good God! he prays for me—even me! Liſten!—'Reſtore his peace of mind.'—O, poor martyr! that's a vain petition—Alas, Milwood! what have I ſworn to do?—But you cannot both live? Why, O, why was I permitted to ſee this hour!—Hark! the bed creaks—he lays his aged limbs to reſt—never, never more to riſe!"</p>
               <p>All was now perfect ſilence in the houſe, ſo that the daſhing of the ocean's waves were heard diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the windows of that range of chambers overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſea. When he parted from Milwood ſhe had furniſhed him with a dagger, and gave him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſmall packet, with an injunction not to open<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it till
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:038596_0279_10122DDD4A1F0C98"/>
the bell tolled one. This dagger he now drew from his boſom, and placed it, with the packet on the table.</p>
               <p>His reflections now grew more and more tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; his reſolution was an hundred times ſhaken, and raiſed again by the memory of Milwood. When the idea of her public death ruſhed acroſs his brain, madneſs nerved his arm, and he often graſped the dagger in a ſtate of phrenſy.</p>
               <p>In this horrible conflict the hour paſſed away; the clock in the gallery ſtruck one. A chilly ſweat dewed his whole frame—his blood ſhot like a bolt of ice to his heart. With a trembling hand he opened the packet; it contained a moſt animating likeneſs of Milwood, in miniature, and fully anſwered the purpoſe ſhe intended. A ſmall ſcroll of paper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, in her own hand writing, theſe words:—"If another hour elapſes, and the deed is not performed, you may gaze on the reſemblance of Milwood, but will never behold the original alive." He gazed on the portrait; he read the ſcroll again; again he contemplated the miniature—he kiſſed it with fervour—his brain grew inflamed—imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation riotted—He kiſſed the miniature again—he placed it in his boſom, graſped the dagger, and, throwing off his ſlippers, opened his chamber door. Not a breath moved along the gallery—he ſtood trembling for a few moments, fearfully gazing around him—his ſhadow on the floor ſtartled him—he ſhuddered. Once more he drew the portrait from his boſom, and looked on it by the light reflected from the lamp. Summoning a deſperate effort, he made two or three ſtrides, and found himſelf in his uncle's chamber. He cloſed the door after him, and approached the bed-ſide. A chamber lamp burned in the fire place: by this light, as he leaned againſt the feet of the bed, he perceived his uncle ſlept. At that moment he fancied, that he heard a footſtep in the gallery—he liſtened, and was confirmed it was ſo. He fixed his eyes upon the door in horrid dread

of a detectio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, and half concealed the dagger in his boſom, ſtill holding the candle. No one entered—all was again ſilent. Once more he ſlowly drew the dagger forth, and once more turned his eyes upon his ſleeping uncle. The dim, faint light, emitted from the lamp, juſt ſerved to diſcover his tranquil features. His lips were cloſed in a ſmile, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated peaceful ſlumbers. As he contemplated this ſcene, a deep groan pierced the ears of Barnwell: frozen with horror he dared not to turn his head towards the gallery, whence it ſeemed to iſſue, but remained fixed as a ſtatue. In another moment a voice, ſoftly, but diſtinctly, uttered—"I'll ſit all night on his cold, cold grave!" He fancied it was the voice of his ſiſter. The dagger fell from his ſenſeleſs hand, and he clung to the pillars of the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead for ſupport. Waked by the noiſe and motion, his uncle ſtarted up. Barnwell, inſtigated by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den impulſe, in which fear was an ingredient, ſnatched up the dagger, ſprung upon the breaſt of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable old man, and plunged its fatal point deep in his heart! One groan only preceded his diſſolution!</p>
               <p>The moment the fatal blow was ſtruck, remorſe was kindled, with all its horrors, in the breaſt of Barnwell; a remorſe too powerful for words or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it was a conſuming fire kindled in the centre of his heart. In a few moments the ſame voice he had heard before, exclaimed—"In heaven he will be mine, for Milwood cannot come to heaven." Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to madneſs, he ruſhed like lightning to the door, opened it without regard to the noiſe he made, and beheld, ſitting in her night gown at his own room door, Maria Freeman. This amiable and afflicted girl, ſtill the victim of concealed affection, grew hourly worſe. Her mind conſtantly fixed on the object of her love, was now impreſſed with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his death, and her attendant having fallen aſleep, the lovely maniac had left her bed under the impreſſion of viſiting his tomb. The noiſe and his appearance cauſed her to utter the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

ſhrieks, which brought Mr. Sandall and the ſervants to be witneſſes to a ſcene of the utmoſt horror! Barnwell, taking the advantage of their confuſion, burſt through them all, and fled, with incredible ſpeed towards the cottage.</p>
               <p>Urged on by an inſtinctive ſenſe of danger, ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knowing the route he took, and, without beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a thought on the certain conſequences of his ſudden flight, he purſued his way. Each ſtep he took, he trembled; even the falling leaf that floated in the air, alarmed him. As he approached the ſea, the roaring of the water appalled his guilty ſoul with terror. If, for a minute, he raiſed his eyes from the ground, the moſt horrid images floated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. His uncle's mangled, bleeding corpſe, his father's angry ghoſt, the very torments of the damned racked his imagination! The gloomy aſpect of the heavens aided the force of theſe guilt-born terrors, and rendered his ſituation horrible beyond expreſſion!</p>
               <p>With difficulty he at length found the wicket gate of the cottage—it was locked, nor could all the noiſe he was capable of making gain him admiſſion. Dreading to remain unhouſed, he endeavoured to explore an entrance at the back of the garden, by climbing up to the arbour from the ſands. The tide was flowing rapidly in, and he found he had no time to loſe. By perſeverance, ſpurred on by the deſperation of his mind, he gained, at length a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a part of the cliff, that overhung the ſea, and was within a few paces of the arbour.</p>
               <p>Exhauſted with fatigue, and overpowered by the conflicting exerciſes of his mind, he threw himſelf down on the rock, with a groan of agony. The fever of the ſoul bacame exchanged for a moſt awful lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor—he dared not to think. The roaring of the waters underneath, at length, arouſed him, and the horrors of his ſituation flaſhed once more acroſs his imagination.</p>
               <p>At that moment, riſing from the ground, he felt
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:038596_0282_10122F69745EB918"/>
ſtrongly impelled to plunge from the precipice on which he ſtood into the gulph of waters; but almoſt at the ſame inſtant, the murmuring of approaching whiſpers ſtartled him, and arreſted his attention. It was too dark to diſcern their faces; but he could diſtinguiſh a man and woman plainly, as the former carried a lantern in his hand. They approached the edge of the cliff, and appeared to make towards the ſpot where he ſtood. A little to the right there was a ſpot, where the chalk had fallen away ſome feet in depth, and left a hollow ſpace. Here he crept and concealed himſelf. In a few moments they were cloſe to the place of his concealment—A voice, which he too well knew, now ſtruck his car—'twas Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood's.</p>
               <p>"Well," ſaid ſhe, "how is the tide?"</p>
               <p>"Coming in," ſaid the man, who was Zelotti; "but it won't do this tide; it will be break of day ere there be ſufficient depth of water."</p>
               <p>"Curſed delay!" cried Milwood; "what muſt be done with the body, then?"</p>
               <p>"Let it remain in the ſack, under the ſeat in the arbour, till another night."</p>
               <p>"That might do, if we were certain of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here; but I dread the morning, Zelotti. Fool that I was, to truſt a work of ſuch a nature to his hands. If Barnwell ſhould be detected in the act, or by his weakneſs diſcover it when done, we muſt fly inſtantly, and then old Townley's corpſe would be diſcovered, and his murder clearly traced to me."—[How poor Barnwell ſhuddered!]</p>
               <p>"That's true," replied Zelotti. "Let me conſider, as there are no marks of violence upon his perſon, ſuppoſe we ſtrip him; the effects of the poiſon, in ſwelling the body, may paſs well enough for the ſame effects produced by drowning; ſo that if it floats, and is diſcovered in the morning, there would be no ground of ſuſpicion."</p>
               <p>"Quick then, about it!" cried Milwood; there has been too much delay.—O, Zelotti! if Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well's
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:038596_0283_10122F6BD1091D50"/>
heart were but moulded like our own, what a glorious harveſt ſhould we reap!—But, my ſoul miſgives me—I fear his tenderneſs, his fooliſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe.—Would this night were well over!"</p>
               <p>They had now retired out of the hearing of Barnwell. He had, however, heard enough to petrify his ſoul with horror!—It was plain that Milwood had poiſoned her father!—Language is not equal to the taſk of deſcribing what now paſſed in his agonized boſom! Dreading to meet them, he was compelled to keep his ſituation. Sooner than he imagined, they return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and in a few moments the awful ſound ſmote his ear of the fall of poor Mental's corpſe into it's grave of billows!—He could not check a deep groan at that inſtant.</p>
               <p>"Did you hear any thing?" ſaid Zelotti.</p>
               <p>"No," ſaid Milwood; "<hi>you</hi> are not ſurely turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperſtitious?"</p>
               <p>"I am ſure I heard a groan," ſaid Zelotti.</p>
               <p>"Fancy—fancy—man," cried ſhe:—"Come, we have work to do—Peace to old Townley—now for his treaſures."</p>
               <p>They bent their way towards the arbour. Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well followed them with his eye. In their hurry they forgot the ladder by which they deſcended from the window of the arbour. He noticed this neglect, and, waiting a conſiderable time, his firſt impulſe was to aſcend the ladder; but he checked it, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued wandering near the ſpot till break of day.</p>
               <p>The tortures inflicted by his conſcience became al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt inſupportable, and he once again reſolved to die.</p>
               <p>At the very moment, however, of acting upon this dreadful reſolution, an indeſcribable terror ſeized him, and turned him from his purpoſe. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of a future ſtate was ſo deeply impreſſed upon his mind, that, though ſurrounded by miſery, he dared not to plunge, uncalled, into eternity. Again, when the horrible conſequences of his crime ruſhed in force upon his imagination, he felt almoſt irriſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:038596_0284_10122F6DA017D200"/>
impelled to eſcape them by the only means left—the guilt of ſuicide!</p>
               <p>Thus wretchedly paſſed the hours of darkneſs: now the torments of his ſituation drove him almoſt to ſelf murder; and now the dread of what another world might prove, deterred him from the crime. Nor was the recent ſcene he had witneſſed the leaſt part of his preſent wretchedneſs—Sorrow for the fate of Mental, at any common period, would have pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully afflicted him; put when the incontrovertible evidence of his own ſight and hearing proved to him the real character of Milwood, ſurpriſe, agony, and deſpair took poſſeſſion of his ſoul!</p>
               <p>Such was the ſtate of mind in which, early in the morning, Milwood and Zelotti diſcovered the poor loſt Barnwell. Anxiety reſpecting the body of the murdered Mental brought them to obſerve if the tide had thrown it on the ſhore. When Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood firſt ſaw Barnwell, he was kneeling, his hands claſped, and his eyes were fixed on the riſing ſun.</p>
               <p>"Amazement!" exclaimed ſhe. "Barnwell! Barnwell!—Tell me, do my ſenſes deceive me?"</p>
               <p>Barnwell ſurveyed me with a wild inquiring gaze, but ſpoke not.</p>
               <p>"Anſwer me," ſaid ſhe; "does he live?"</p>
               <p>"In heaven!" ſaid Barnwell, ſhaking his head, and ſhewing ſome blood upon his hands.</p>
               <p>"Why then, are you here?" ſaid ſhe; "you ſhould have remained in your chamber, as I directed you, to avoid ſuſpicion.—Where is the dagger—where is the miniature?"</p>
               <p>"By his bleeding corpſe!" ſaid Barnwell, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly.</p>
               <p>"Fool!—madman!—Did you <hi>intend</hi> detection?—My portrait left in the room!—perhaps my letter too.—Zelotti, we muſt fly—this inſtant we muſt fly!—Away—away!—and leave this whimpering boy to the fate his folly merits."</p>
               <p>She caſt a look of contemptuous rage on him, and walked ſwiftly towards the arbour, followed by Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotti.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="286" facs="unknown:038596_0285_101230FB7908BD10"/>
Barnwell, rouſed from his ſtupor of miſery, by this conduct, purſued them, exclaiming, as he went—"Milwood—Milwood—hear me!" At the foot of the ladder he ſeized her hand eagerly—"Loſt—loſt woman!—Why am I ſtill anxious concerning you?—Why, even after you have driven me to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, do I ſtill love you?—Why is it, that, though I know you a murderer, I cannot—cannot deteſt you?—O, then, liſten to me, Milwood; and, inſtead of attempting, to eſcape the juſt puniſhment of our crimes, let us ſurrender ourſelves to death, as the only atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in our power, and devote the few hours we may live in preparing for eternity!"</p>
               <p>"Canting babe—preaching infant!" cried Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, ſcornfully. "Know, fool, that ſhe, to whom you preach, is of a nature above indulging ſuch dreams, as haunt children of prejudice, and dupes of prieſt-craft, like yourſelf. She ſcoffs your counſel, and deſpiſes you for offering it. To you, and ſuch as you, ſhe leaves it to bend the neck ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively to laws and ordinances. Her life is her all; ſhe dreams of no future worlds, nor dreads ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts hereafter. On ſuch, the puny fears of others, ſhe builds her towering projects, and would not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if ſhe had the power, to hurl yon blazing orb of light from its fixed centre to deſtroy whole ſyſtems, that oppoſed her purpoſe."</p>
               <p>"Can human nature fall ſo low?" cried Barnwell, "can that, which we are taught to believe emanates from Deity itſelf, become infernal?"</p>
               <p>"Who is this Deity you ſpeak of?—Where is his power?—If he exiſts, why did he ſuffer you, a villain, maddened by luſt, to murder ſleeping inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence?—Fool!—fool!—fool!—Away, Zelotti."</p>
               <p>"Yet, one moment, hold," cried Barnwell. "Where is my friend—where is Townley? O, what muſt be your agony, Milwood, when you hear, that Townley, he whoſe murdered corpſe, laſt night, you yielded to the deep, was—your father!"</p>
               <p>"Already is the mighty ſecret known!" ſaid ſhe.
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:038596_0286_101230FE45C43DF8"/>
"I know he was my father—I own, too, that theſe hands mixed and adminiſtered the doſe that poiſoned him!—Where was the Deity you talk of, <hi>then?</hi>—Why did not his power, if he poſſeſſes it, prevent ſo foul a deed? I knew not, <hi>at the moment,</hi> that he was my father: the contents of his caſket, and his papers told me, that he had played a character that he was not in reality, and he has fallen in conſequence.—'Tis poſſible he might have lived, but for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception."</p>
               <p>Barnwell was petrified with horror and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment!</p>
               <p>"In a few hours," continued Milwood, as ſhe aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the ladder, "ſome dungeon may immerſe us, if we remain, Zelotti.—Come, then, nor let us waſte the preſent opportunity."</p>
               <p>As ſhe uttered the laſt words, ſhe entered the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by the window. In the ſame inſtant ſhe ſhriek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed violently, and three men ruſhed down the ladder, from the window, and ſecured Barnwell and Zelotti. The ravings of Milwood were too horrible to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe. During their abſence from the cottage, Mr. Sandall, attended by ſeveral of the domeſtics, and conducted by the information found in Barnwell's papers, had arrived there, and forced the outer gates. As the garden door was open, they had juſt entered the arbour, when the voice of Barnwell arreſted their attention; and concluding, from the replies of Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, that ſhe was returning, they ſtationed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch a manner as to ſecure her when ſhe entered. The criminals were immediately conveyed before a magiſtrate, and committed to priſon. Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood continued to rave. Zelotti loaded her with reproaches; but Barnwell ſilently hung down his head, and endeavoured to conceal the tears, that bedewed his pallid cheeks.</p>

               <p>NIGHT approached—Milwood, who, during the whole day, had ſought, in vain, an opportunity of ſelf-deſtruction; at length, overcome by the violent exertions of deſpair, ſunk on her pillow, and ſlept. Two women, who were appointed to watch in her apartment, ſoon after midnight, were arouſed by the violent ſhrieks which ſhe uttered in her ſleep. Pierced to the heart by her exclamations, which ſeemed to indicate the moſt excruciating tortures of her mind, they were yet too ſuperſtitious to awake her. Several inhabitants of the priſon, alarmed by her dreadful cries, entered the apartment, and ſtood trembling round the bed of the deſpairing Milwood. Big drops of ſweat rolled down her cheeks, her eyes were half open, her teeth gnaſhed horribly, and her whole frame was ſtrongly convulſed.</p>
               <p>At length ſtarting up in the bed, ſhe ſeized the hand of a by-ſtander, exclaiming, in a voice of horror—"Am I in hell?—O, torment me not, my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!—do not <hi>you</hi> inflict the tortures!—Barnwell—Barnwell—end my miſeries!—O, they have torn my fleſh with burning pincers!—Now they are ſhooting ſparks of fire in my eyes—ſcorpions faſten on my breaſts—and ſee, my murdered father fixes his ghaſtly eyes on me!—Barnwell I own the deed:—thy uncle's bleeding ghoſt approaches!—Save me—ſave me!—See, they bring more brands of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ire—ſhowers of fire deſcend!—O, my heart burns—it burns—and yet I do not die!"</p>
               <p>A ſhivering fit now ſeized her, and ſhe awoke. Caſting her eyes wildly round her, by degrees ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected her ſituation. Among the priſoners, who ſtood near her, was a clergyman confined for debt.
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:038596_0288_10123101A15395F0"/>
Viewing the horrors of her mind, he was prompted to offer her ſome conſolation.</p>
               <p>"Unhappy woman!" ſaid he, "ſee the ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of guilt!—As yet thy terrors are only ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary; may they prove ſalutary, and lead you to ſeek, by heart-felt penitence, that chriſtian hope of mercy, which alone can calm your mind!—Are you willing I ſhould pray with you?"</p>
               <p>She fixed her eyes upon him—"Mercy!" cried ſhe. "Penitence!—Pray for me!—To whom?"</p>
               <p>"To your Almighty Judge!"</p>
               <p>"There is not an Almighty Judge—'Tis falſe, old man. There is not—cannot—no—no—there cannot be another world—or if there is, why am I tortured with the thought of it—when, if there is—I—I—O! no—no—do not ſay there is another world!"</p>
               <p>"Surely, moſt ſurely, there is," ſaid the good old man, with a vehemence that made her tremble.</p>
               <p>She ſtruck her hand violently againſt her head.—"If, indeed, there ſhould," exclaimed ſhe, "horrible thought!—I dare not think!—O, if you have any pity for my wretched lot, give me ſome potent draught, ſome cordial, that will drown all ſenſe of what is paſt—all dread of what may come!"</p>
               <p>The worthy miniſter, who truly merited the title of a chriſtian prieſt, exerted every effort to ſooth the workings of deſpair. He diſmiſſed the idle gazers from the room, and was in the act of kneeling to offer up a prayer, when the poor object of his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſhrieked violently, and implored him to deſiſt.</p>
               <p>"'Tis torture—torture—torture!" cried ſhe; "I am accurſed, and I hate all good!"</p>
               <p>Finding his attentions increaſed her deſpair in her preſent frame of mind, he deſiſted, in the hope of a more tranquil moment. By his advice, they permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her to take ſome wine, and ſhe, once more, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſleep. But a few minutes, however, had elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ere ſhe awoke again, under the ſame impreſſions of horror!</p>

                  <pb n="290" facs="unknown:038596_0289_101231049A5706D8"/>
Mr. Elderton, the clergyman, had not left the room, but had employed himſelf in ſilent prayer. Her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair now roſe to fury; her expreſſions were horribly blaſphemous, and aſſiſtance was neceſſary to keep her in her bed. Her exertions were fatal. In the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm of her deſpair ſhe burſt a blood veſſel; the blood guſhed rapidly from her mouth, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding every poſſible aſſiſtance was inſtantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, before the ſun aroſe, deſpairing ſhe expired!</p>
               <p>At break of day, upon viſiting Zelotti's apartment, the keeper of the priſon diſcovered he had taken poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the preceding night. He had not undreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and his corpſe lay a dreadful ſpectacle, ſtretched upon the floor. A ſcrap of paper lay near him, on which were ſcrawled with a pencil theſe words, bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly legible, ſuppoſed to have been written after he had drunk the poiſon:—"Milwood—<hi>there is a God!</hi> defy him not!—Zelotti."</p>

form. At the entrance of Mr. Elderton he ſtarted; but ſtill kept his eyes on the floor.</p>
               <p>"I have intruded," ſaid Mr. Elderton, "upon hours which, I hope, are devoted to penitence, to announce to you the melancholy end of—."</p>
               <p>"O, God!" cried Barnwell, claſping his hands together, "my mother—I have ſlain my mother!"</p>
               <p>"No—no—no," ſaid Mr. Elderton, eager to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive him, "I ſpeak of the unhappy partners of your guilt, who are now no more. The wretched woman died by the burſting of a blood veſſel in a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm of deſpair, and the man has poiſoned him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf!"</p>
               <p>"God forgive them!" cried Barnwell, "God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give them!—Poor Milwood!"</p>
               <p>Even in his preſent awful ſituation, a pang ſhot through his heart, when he heard ſhe was gone for ever!</p>
               <p>"You mentioned a mother, Sir," ſaid Mr. Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; "have you a mother?</p>
               <p>"O, ſpare me, I beſeech you, whoever you are, ſpare my poor burſting heart the anguiſh of that thought!"</p>
               <p>At that moment the door was thrown open, and Mrs. Barnwell, Eliza, and Mr. Sandall, were in the room. The rumour of Barnwell's abſconding, by ſome means had reached them, and they immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly followed Sir James to Ramſgate. Soon as the wretched mother ſaw the object, which guilt had rendered her ſon; when attempting to meet her, his fetters grated on her ears, overcome by the horrid vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſhe ſunk ſenſeleſs on the floor. Eliza fainted on the boſom of her brother, and the priſon rung with the imprecations of Barnwell on his own guilty head!</p>
               <p>By the direction of Mr. Sandall, whoſe folly had permitted the interview, they were torn aſunder, and conveyed home to the houſe that had been Mr. Emery's. The ſhock which Mrs. Barnwell had received was ſevere, and its effects, even when her ſenſes return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:038596_0291_1012310A9D8ADDC0"/>
confined her to her bed, and rendered the attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a phyſician neceſſary. Eliza, who loved her brother almoſt to adoration, ſuffered an inconceivable pain of heart; but her youth enabled her to ſuſtain the blow with leſs injury to her health, than their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy parent: an alarming attack of the aſthma, to which ſhe was ſubject, occaſioned ſerious apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of her life. Though the dutiful and affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Eliza would not quit her bed ſide, ſhe yet divided her painfully anxious thoughts between the ſick couch of her parent, and the ſad deſtiny of her brother.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Barnwell ſtruggled to meet his fate with reſignation; and if, at times, the horrors that ſurrounded him opened an avenue for thoughts of ſuicide, the truly pious. Elderton was conſtantly, at hand to adminiſter the conſolations of hope to his deſpair.</p>
               <p>Some days paſſed, during which the remains of Sir James Barnwell were conveyed to his late ſeat, and interred. Mrs. Barnwell remained confined to the bed of ſickneſs, and very ſlender hope was entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of her recovery.</p>
               <p>The unfortunate victim of unlimited confidence, Mr. Freeman, had received from the numerous and injured creditors of his houſe, that diſcriminating ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity, for which the merchants of London are celebrated in every part of the globe. He received an immediate and full diſcharge, upon aſſigning over all his eſtates, from which an annuity of ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, for his own life and that of his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, were liberally ſettled upon them-by the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous voice of the creditors, in oppoſition only to his own ſincere wiſhes to the contrary. Mr. Drudge likewiſe experienced their liberality; but the exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the majority of the creditors was fully diſplayed in their conduct to Emery, who, abandoned by his titled friends, was left literally deſtitute, and being unable to procure his certificate, the vengeance of ſeveral purſued him ſo far as to terminate the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſpects of his exiſtence with the gloomy evils of confinement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="unknown:038596_0292_1012310D58D18BD0"/>
Such was the ſituation of his affairs when Mr. Freeman returned to Ramſgate, after the funeral of his old friend Sir James, who had left him his exec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utor. The greateſt part of his eſtates were bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to his wretched nephew, and, in failure of iſſue, to his ſiſter and her deſcendants. Very handſome proviſion was made for Mrs. Barnwell and Eliza, and, excepting a few complimentary legacies, no part of his property was bequeathed out of the family of his brother. The horrid deed of Barnwell received a ſtill deeper tint of horror, by the benevolent intentions thus diſplayed.</p>
               <p>Not the combined wealth of worlds, is able to era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate the cankering ſpeck of guilt, or prevent that courſe of conſequences which nature has decreed. Never, perhaps, was the inſufficiency of wealth to make the heart happy, more powerfully proved than in the miſerable Barnwell's.</p>
               <p>As the awful day of public trial drew near, the channels of grief flowed in more painful violence through the hearts of this moſt wretched family. The good and tender-hearted Freeman ſympathiſed deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the mourners, and ſtole occaſionally a thought from the melancholy image of his beloved daughter, bereft of reaſon, to mingle ſorrows with them.</p>
               <p>Barnwell had particularly requeſted to be alone, and peremptorily refuſed the viſits of all but the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Elderton. By theſe means he gradually prepared his mind for thoſe awful scenes which he was ſhortly to encounter. Eliza, whoſe mind was conſiderably above the common level, calling the energies of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and the hopes of religion to her aid, thus temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſenſibility of her heart to ſuſtain the miſeries that preſſed heavily upon her. The following letter will exhibit the ſtate of her mind.</p>

                           <p>I am condemned to die—I know the very hour of my diſſolution—on Monday morning at eight o'clock I ſhall—Why do I ſtill feel this weight of ſhame? Why is the <hi>ignominy</hi> of death, even yet more painful to me than any apprehenſions of its tortures? A ſpectacle! a public puniſhment!—a warning exhibition to the wicked of ſociety!—O, my poor, expiring mother, was it for this you ſuffered the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of my birth!—was it for this, with anxious, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

for this, that <hi>you,</hi> with the ſame tender vigilance, ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed on the opening intellect, nurtured each growing virtue, and rooted out the early weeds of vice!</p>
                           <p>O, hear me, on my knees, thou ſacred ſhade, and fend ſome miniſtering angel to calm the ſoul of thy afflicted, loſt, and guilty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Tell me, then, ſome holy ſage, O, tell me, how ſhall ever peace again be wooed within this boſom?</p>
                           <p>How could I do it!—can it be poſſible!—was it this very heart, this ſame mind that now ſhudders at the memory of the act, that could deviſe a miſchief, which, were it to do again, I think no power on earth, nor fiend of hell, could, by all its tortures, force me to commit!—Murder!—O, God! have I not piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſacrifice of a lamb to man's neceſſities? Have I not often ſaved a captive fly from the torturing paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of my ſchool-fellows?

                           <p>O, Milwood! dare I, in ſuch a ſolemn moment, ſo near, ſo very near the dreadful entrance of eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty—dare I call back the ſpirit that has flitted o'er the gulph before me, bid it appear in that form of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that kindled the flame of luſt in my boſom? Dare I inquire how, or from whence, thoſe tumults ſprung, that hurried on the ſoul to its deſtruction!—O, vaſt reſearch! chaos of inquiry!—'Till thy form at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted me, 'till thy touch intoxicated me—O, fatal beauty! I could not have allowed even a thought of injury to a fellow-creature, admiſſion to my heart! What, then, wert thou, O, wond'rous power, what was the nature of that potent influence, which thy charms ſhed o'er my ſoul, that it could change the ſoft and gentle influences of compaſſion, that ever

               <p>As Barnwell wrote the laſt ſentence, the pious Mr. Elderton entered the cell, and caſting his eye over his paper, caught the queſtion.—"Yes, my young friend," ſaid he, "'twas paſſion; but aſk thyſelf, if, in the compoſition of our natures, paſſion has no anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote? Where was the voice of reaſon, when firſt the ſubtle tempter wooed thee to thy ruin?"</p>
               <p>"Stifled,' ſaid Barnwell, "by the ſtronger cries of paſſion."</p>
               <p>"Granted," ſaid Mr. Elderton; "but paſſion's boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous breath became at length, exhauſted, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <hi>then</hi> was heard!—Ah, poor friend!" conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued he, taking him affectionately by the hand, "had you but liſtened <hi>then,</hi> though you had ſinned, yet how far ſhort would you have ſtopped of your preſent depth of guilt! But I wonder not, when I contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the uncommon talents of the ſeducer, the frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of nature, and the inexperience of your heart. Had you but revealed your ſituation, the ſtrong foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of all Milwood's plans muſt have vaniſhed, and you would have been ſaved. Fatal reverſe!—O, may the dread example operate with every heſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting youth, who, bending beneath the weight of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret ſhame, longs, yet dreads, to confide his ſorrows and his errors in ſome pitying breaſt.—And may each individual, honored with the name of parent, or of guardian, who hears thy woful ſtory, aim, with increaſing zeal, to WIN THE CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FUL HEARTS! May they reflect of what warring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds human hearts are framed, reflect how much at variance with the inſtitutions of ſociety are many of our paſſions!—And God forgive the man, who, by a COLD <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fortunately for Barnwell, Mr. Elderton was no
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:038596_0297_101231199DF4E260"/>
bigot: he labored not to bend his penitent to the feigned belief of controverted doctrines; he labored not to <hi>exchange</hi> the principles of reaſon for Chriſtian faith, but aimed to ſtrengthen the hopes of the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by the aſſurances of the latter. He ſucceeded, and the laſt thoughts of Barnwell were thus expreſſed, with a tranquillity that conſoles the heart, which pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties his ſad end, and bows the ſpirit that would queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the JUSTICE of that OMNIPOTENCE, that permitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his fall.</p>

                           <p>"A few more ſleeting hours!—How awful rolls the echo of the midnight bell along theſe dark and diſmal vaults!—Solemn, ſilent hour!—How many ſons of care now ſleep, lightened of their anxious loads!—I, too, ſhall ſhortly ſleep—but <hi>they</hi> ſhall wake again to care—again become the ſport of hopes and fears!—Shall <hi>I,</hi> too, wake?—Say, can the narrow limits of an earthly life bound the exiſtence of the aſpiring ſoul? O, trembling inmate of this frail form, prepare! thy preſent tenement in a few hours falls, for ever falls!—Prepare to wing thy flight, ſee brighter realms appear, and kindred ſpirits wait to waft thee to their bleſt abode! I'll think no more of earth then! Mother—ſiſter—friends—and if I have a foe—all, all farewell! Seek not to know why Heaven permitted murder, or how my arm has done a deed, at which my heart recoils!

               <p>Theſe were the laſt words he wrote. The hour of ſuffering, of ſhame, of death arrived, and Barnwell having penitently yielded to the conſequences of his crimes, his liberated ſpirit winged its trembling flight to the bright throne of mercy!</p>
               <p>The pangs a mother felt at this ſad cataſtophe, who can deſcribe? Happily they were ſhort—ſoon the welcome herald, Death, arrived, and changed thoſe temporal ſcenes, a ſon's crimes had rendered painful, for views of bliſs no clouds can ever darken! Maria, too, fell, like a blighted bloſſom, to the earth, and with her laſt ſigh mingled the name of Barnwell.</p>
               <p>The worthy Mr. Freeman met the event with calm, yet heart-felt ſorrow. The painful viciſſitudes of fortune, reſerved for this, the evening of his life, had bowed his mind; and having ſtripped him of this his laſt hold on earthly bliſs, he endured, with reſignation, an exiſtence of tranquillity, almoſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a hope, or an anxiety!</p>
               <p>Eliza, the ſiſter of Barnwell, became his charge, and if ever a temporal concern floated in his mind, it was on her account. By the recent ſad events ſhe acquired the very large property of her late uncle, and retired with her guardian to his reſidence. Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row oft viſited her in this retirement, when memory muſed on melancholy ſcenes gone by. Yet Eliza ſtruggled with regret: ſhe had imbibed ſome early leſſons of ſound and pure philoſophy, the advantages of which now ſhone conſpicuous. She contemplated, with earneſtneſs, her ſituation, and the ſtrongeſt feeling of her heart was a dread, that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he ſhould miſapply the loan of wealth, which Heaven had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to her care.</p>
               <p>Her next concern was, to render Mr. Freeman as happy as her ſoci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty and means could make him, and ſhe aimed with zealous diligence to amuſe his reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the paſt. The ſit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ation of the Miſs Eme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's and their mother, attracted her attention, and
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:038596_0299_101231202E20BF10"/>
indulged her with an opportunity of exerciſing that benevolence, which was the chief trait in her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. With the conſent of Mr. Freeman, ſhe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded them an aſylum in her houſe, and ſtudied to make their dependence as little felt as poſſible. She frequently enabled the daughters, by her generoſity, to remit thoſe comforts to their father, which ameli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orated the horrors of confinement; and ſhe looked forward to the termination of her minority for the pleaſing ability of placing them beyond the fear of dependence, by the ſettlement of an annuity, that would enſure them, with frugality, the decencies, though not the luxuries, of life.</p>
               <p>In ſuch delightful employ, we leave Eliza, whoſe diſcriminating generoſity afforded her many heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt pleaſures, and the exerciſe of which was her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant reſource, whenever memory pointed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of CONCEALED ERRORS in the melancholy fate of her brother.</p>
