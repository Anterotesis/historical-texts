            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I AM very ſenſible that in communicating my ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents on the policy of the United States, I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe myſelf to the cenſure of many; particularly thoſe who are appointed by the people to ſuperintend the political intereſt of the nation. This idea forcibly ſtrikes my mind. I ſee the impropriety of wandering out of the road which Providence hath aſſigned me, and ſtepping into that allotted to more conſpicuous characters. I feel myſelf alſo inadequate to the taſk of writing judiciouſly on the ſubject, and I already an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate the mortification of finding my views and performance reprobated.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding theſe forbidding circumſtances, I have determined to communicate my reflections on this ſubject, and that for the following reaſons: 1ſt, Becauſe the welfare of the United States ever hath been and now is an object of my warmeſt wiſhes and deſires, which has produced an irreſiſtable inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to contribute every thing in my power to promote ſo great and important an end. 2d, Becauſe, altho' all men are not warranted in taking upon themſelves the office of dictators, or powers of legiſlation; yet,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021774_0003_0FB59D750FB6B868"/>they are encouraged by the general conſent of the people, and by the moſt liberal and judicious maxims, to contribute to the general welfare of the nation, by an unreſtrained communication of ſentiments and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations. Such an encouragement, which in ſome reſpects is peculiar to this country, I look upon as eſſential to its political intereſt and happineſs; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſupports a general ſpirit of enquiry and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation among the people, by which means they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſuch a degree of political knowledge, as to be able to diſtinguiſh between proper and improper meaſures of government—to diſcover errors and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe remedies—to be ſeaſonably alarmed on juſt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and to be ſatisfied under a wiſe and good adminiſtration. 3d, Becauſe the intereſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the citizens of the United States will be influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and immediately affected by the ſyſtem of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and commerce which the national legiſlature may form and eſtabliſh; and, as I apprehend, the ſubject when brought into conſideration will be found involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in many difficulties; ſo, I flatter myſelf, that the communication of ſuch remarks and obſervations on the ſubject as are founded in truth and reaſon, and written with decency and modeſty, will be noticed according to their merit. If thoſe gentlemen who have made the political intereſt of the United States a ſubject of reflection and obſervation, would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate their reſult, it appears to me that much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage might be derived therefrom. It would tend, I conceive, to the forming a ſyſtem of revenue and commerce in a greater degree of perfection; for, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is to be preſumed that the general Congreſs will be compoſed of the moſt enlightened men in the ſtates, and I truſt, I may add, the moſt patriotic, yet, it is not to be ſuppoſed that infinite knowledge or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible meaſures will diſtinguiſh that from all other public bodies of men. Even this body, I conceive, may draw information from a variety of quarters, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:021774_0004_0FB59D77FB8CCFE0"/>knowledge from many ſources. 4th, Becauſe, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding I entertain no vain idea of my own ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city or abilities, yet, as light may ſpring up out of darkneſs, and a ſpark be ſtruck from a very unpoliſhed material; ſo I am encouraged to proceed from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the poſſibility of my ſuggeſting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which, in the hands of wiſe and judicious men, may be improved to advantage. And 5th, I am the more encouraged to this communication from a further conſideration, that in addreſſing you in particular, I have nothing to fear, being confident that the beſt and moſt proper uſe will be made of it. From the ſhort time in which I have had the honor, as well as the pleaſure of being known to you, I am convinced your ſentiments and wiſhes reſpecting the welfare and proſperity of the United States, are congenial with my own: You will therefore, I doubt not, put a libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtruction on my views, and treat the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with candor. If you find nothing here worthy of notice, you will not improve it to my diſadvantage; if any thing capable of improvement, you will make the beſt uſe of it.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the compoſition, I could aſſign ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reaſons as an apology for the numberleſs defects which you will diſcover, but ſhall omit them: You are probably acquainted with ſome of them, and will for that reaſon, I hope, treat the imperfections of the piece with the tenderneſs of a friend.</p>
            <p>Without further explanation or apology, therefore, I will proceed to give you the reſult of my reflections on the political intereſt of the United States, and ſome of the meaſures which to me appear neceſſary to promote and ſecure their welfare; in doing of which I aim at proceeding on original principles, without entangling my mind with the ſyſtems and maxims of other nations.</p>
            <p>As it is with individuals, ſo it is with nations in their connections and tranſactions with one another;
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021774_0005_0FB59D7D26C3F728"/>the acquiſition of property or accumulation of wealth is a grand and principal object; for on the wealth of a nation does its ſecurity and the temporal felicity of the people in a great meaſure depend; and the ſame meaſures which an individual doth or ought to take for the accumulation of wealth ſhould be purſued by a nation. In both caſes, a dependence on their own reſources, and the beſt improvement of the natural advantages which they may poſſeſs, is that alone by which either can hope or expect to ſucceed.</p>
            <p>Deſpots who have held nations in vaſſalage, altho' their avarice has been inſatiable, have very often over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked that which would the neareſt have come up to their views. They have drained their ſubjects of their money by oppreſſion; have reduced them to poverty and diſtreſs, and at the ſame time neglected the moſt proper and neceſſary meaſures to have put them into and kept them in a flouriſhing condition. By this means they have, at times, filled a treaſury; but at the expence of thoſe reſources and advantages where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a treaſury might be repleniſhed from time to time, as occaſions required.</p>
            <p>This I conceive always hath been, and always will be the caſe, more or leſs, where the views and intereſt of the government, and thoſe of the people at large, are conſidered in any degree or reſpect different and independent of one another. But in free governments, where the views of the legiſlature and of adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the intereſt of the public, and the intereſt and views of individuals are conſidered the ſame, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of government do, or ought to aim at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the wealth of the people, rather than at the drawing their property into the public treaſury; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, by increaſing the riches of the people, or by laying a ſuitable foundation for a conſtant accumula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of wealth, an inexhauſtible ſource is provided for national purpoſes, which can always be applied to as occaſions may require, without rendering public demands oppreſſive and diſtreſſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:021774_0006_0FB59D8039CBDE30"/>
The firſt object therefore to be had in view by government in its ſyſtem of policy, as it particularly reſpects property, is, I conceive, the increaſe of the wealth of the people.</p>
            <p>This being premiſed, I would obſerve.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> That there are certain reſources and natural advantages which all nations are in the poſſeſſion of, and certain ways and means by which they may increaſe their wealth, and in proportion to thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources and advantages may their wealth be increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but the actual increaſe of wealth depends on the manner of improvement. A nation, poſſeſſing every advantage which it is in the power of nature to endow it with, may nevertheleſs be embarraſſed, poor and dependent; and a nation poſſeſſing but few natural advantages, may, by wiſe and prudent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, joined with induſtry and enterpriſe, become independent and even opulent. Exemplary inſtances in proof hereof might be adduced. It is therefore, by a judicious improvement of the reſources and natural advantages which the United States poſſeſs, that they can expect to become opulent or truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second.</hi> By agriculture, manufactures and commerce, the reſources and advantages of a country are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and applied in the firſt place, to the furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people with the means of ſubſiſtence and conveniencies of life; and in the next, to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of property or accumulation of wealth. But as theſe in their operation and influence may counteract one another and deſtroy their ultimate intention, it remains with the government or legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative authority of the nation, on whom its welfare depends, to confine theſe general and common inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts, in their operation, in ſuch a manner, as that they may co-operate to anſwer the end for which they are deſigned, viz. To promote the general welfare of the nation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:021774_0007_0FB59D81071D6558"/>
               <hi>Third.</hi> If the riches of a nation may be increaſed inproportion to its natural advantages and reſources, which cannot be diſputed, then it may be ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally concluded, that the United States may become more opulent than any other nation; becauſe the reſources and advantages which they poſſeſs, are greater and more various than any other nation enjoys. The diverſity of climate and ſoil within the limits of the United States, are adapted to the greateſt variety of vegetable and animal production of any nation whatever. The earth abounds with the moſt neceſſary minerals, and the ſea furniſhes a great variety and plenty of fiſh. They have the advantage of an extenſive ſea coaſt, and no nation can boaſt of ſuch inland ſeas and water communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the United States.</p>
            <p>This country has all the means within itſelf of furniſhing every neceſſary, convenience and luxury of life, and of carrying on an extenſive foreign and domeſtic commerce; conſequently it hath every thing which nature can beſtow, to render it opulent and powerful, and the people eaſy and happy in their circumſtances. All that is wanting to produce theſe effects is to improve the advantages of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the beſt manner and to the moſt valuable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; to encourage induſtry and the uſeful arts, and by a judicious ſyſtem of commerce, ſo to encourage, protect and regulate the agricultural, manufacturing and commercial intereſts in their various branches and departments, as to render them mutually ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the general weal.</p>
            <p>In the proſecution of my deſign, I ſhall confine my obſervations generally to agriculture, manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and commerce, and attempt to ſhew ſome of the moſt eſſential advantages which are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived therefrom; the influence which they recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally have on each other; the embarraſſments they are now under; the meaſures neceſſary to remove
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021774_0008_0FB59D828AA59600"/>the impediments in the way of their advancement and proſperity; and in ſhort, a brief ſketch of that general plan of regulations which appear to me ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and proper to advance the wealth and power of the United States, by rendering their agriculture, manufactures and commerce mutually ſubſervient thereunto. And as it will be impoſſible to conſider theſe as fully as will be neceſſary, without embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the idea a national revenue, ſo far as it is founded on, and derived from commerce, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them in connection with each other. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I enter on theſe, I would introduce two or three prefatory obſervations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> It is a matter which ought to be impreſſed on the mind of every one, that in any general regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which may be adopted by the national legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture relative to the general intereſts of the people, it is impoſſible equally to regard the intereſt of every individual; and indeed in ſome inſtances it would be improper; becauſe the private intereſt of individuals, is very often directly oppoſed to the general intereſt of the nation.</p>
            <p>The intereſt of the public, or that which is the beſt calculated to promote the common intereſt of the nation, is undoubtedly to be regarded in prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the partial intereſt of any of its parts, or the private intereſt of any individual, and that for this reaſon; becauſe it is impoſſible to increaſe the wealth of a nation, let it come in by what door or through whoſe hands it will; or let it in the firſt inſtance benefit whom, or whatever particular parts of the nation it may, without its having a proper influence and effect on every individual, either di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly or in a more indirect manner. And ſo on the other hand, the wealth of a nation cannot be diminiſhed, let it be through whoſe hands it will, without its affecting every individual in the nation. The detached parts of the United States, as well as
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021774_0009_0FB59D8442CC56D0"/>individuals, ought therefore, and undoubtedly they will be convinced, that the ſyſtem of revenue and commerce, which the national government may form and eſtabliſh, having for its object the general intereſt and welfare of the ſtates, ſhould meet with the approbation and ſupport of the people, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding ſome may be more directly and immediately benefited than others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second.</hi> But, notwithſtanding this, as the United States are in ſome particulars differently circumſtanced with reſpect to their intereſts, from the people of any other nation, a ſpirit of accommodation, I conceive, ought to run through the general regulations of trade. But ſuch accommodations ought not to be without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. They ought not to be ſo calculated as to keep the intereſts of the ſeveral ſtates different, and forever ſeparate and diſtinct; but rather, by ſome eaſy and eligible mode in the change of their commercial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and connections, eventually conſolidate, and render them the ſame.</p>
            <p>At preſent, the ſame regulations of trade which would be moſt advantageous to the northern ſtates, might injure the intereſts of the ſouthern ſtates; for inſtance, it would be to the advantage of the northern ſtates, if the freighting buſineſs ſhould be wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the veſſels of the United States, becauſe they have veſſels and ſeamen ſufficient to freight the whole of their productions to market; but this is not the caſe with the ſouthern ſtates; they have neither veſſels nor ſeamen ſufficient for that purpoſe, and this deficiency the northern ſtates are not at this time able fully to ſupply. Had the northern ſtates veſſels and ſeamen ſufficient to ſerve the intereſt of the ſouthern ſtates in their freighting buſineſs, they ought by a general regulation to have a preference: But as they have not at preſent, as they might at this time be much more improved than they are, and as in a ſhort time they might increaſe their navigation in ſuch
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021774_0010_0FB59D8D08324C10"/>a manner as to freight the produce of the ſouthern ſtates, ſhould the ſouthern ſtates neglect to increaſe their navigation, and ſtill depend on foreign veſſels, I apprehend that the regulations of trade reſpecting the admiſſion of foreign veſſels in the commerce of the United States, ought to be adapted to the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the ſouthern ſtates; but in ſuch a manner, that a preference of ſome kind be eventually ſecured to the veſſels of the United States, either by an impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of duties on foreign veſſels, or by cutting off the original cauſes of the preference which has been given to them in the commerce of the States. Again,</p>
            <p>The northern ſtates are able to furniſh their veſſels with a full complement of ſeamen; the ſouthern ſtates are not, and probably the northern ſtates are not able to ſupply this deficiency, for which reaſon I conceive, that the laws of navigation in this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, ſhould be adapted to the circumſtances of the ſouthern ſtates, and admit of a greater proportion of foreign ſeamen in the navigation of American veſſels, than would be proper, were all the ſtates able to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh a full proportion. The northern ſtates would employ American ſeamen none the leſs, on account of ſuch an indulgence; and as the proportion which may probably be fixed, will oblige the ſouthern ſtates to give greater encouragement and ſupport to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſeamen than they have heretofore done, it will be the means of producing at laſt a ſufficient number of American ſeamen, to give a full comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment throughout the ſtates to their navigation. Again,</p>
            <p>It would be to the intereſt of the northern ſtates, totally to prohibit the importation of many articles of produce and manufacture; becauſe they do, or might furniſh them ſufficiently for their own uſe; and becauſe they do produce and manufacture many articles in ſufficient quantities for the uſe of all the ſtates. In the regulations of trade therefore reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021774_0011_0FB59D909326F440"/>importations, I conceive many articles of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce and manufacture ſhould be prohibited from foreign nations <hi>throughout</hi> the ſtates, and others pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in the northern ſtates, which may be found neceſſary to be admitted in the ſouthern ſtates, for perhaps a limited time. But at the ſame time ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſuch a duty as would give ſupport and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to American manufactures, throughout all the ſtates.</p>
            <p>Some accommodations of the nature of thoſe here ſuggeſted, I apprehend, might take place in the general regulations, much to the preſent advantage of particular ſtates, without creating any new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages to the general intereſt, as the ſtates are now circumſtanced.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third.</hi> As the ſyſtem of revenue and commerce will have a direct and immediate influence on the property and intereſts of the people, it ſhould have certain objects in view, beſides the drawing of money into the national treaſury. I always had an objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in my own mind, to the five per cent impoſt on this account. It appeared to have nothing further in view than a revenue; whereas, as I apprehend, a ſyſtem of revenue and commerce in its conſtruction, ought to aim, 1ſt. At accommodating the intereſts of agriculture, manufactures and commerce in ſuch a manner, as to render them reciprocally a ſupport to each other, and mutually beneficial to the intereſt of the nation. 2d. It ſhould aim at ſecuring to the people the advantages and emoluments of every occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, buſineſs and employment, in which they are ſeverally engaged, not repugnant to the general wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, by preventing rivalries. 3d. It ſhould aim at preventing a too general and profuſe a uſe of luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and frivolous articles of merchandize, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the taſte of the people becomes vitiated, their morals corrupted, and the valuable property of the country drawn out of it for things of no real worth.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021774_0012_0FB59D9190A30C68"/>4th. It ſhould aim at drawing money from the rich and opulent, for public ſervices in ſuch ways and by ſuch methods, as their own choice and approbation may concur therein; and in this way, 5th. To eaſe the burdens of the lower claſſes of the people; and 6th. If there is not circulating money in the ſtates to anſwer the purpoſes of the public, as well as of individuals, one great object to be aimed at in a ſyſtem of commerce, is the increaſe of money.</p>
            <p>In the further treatment of the ſubject, I ſhall not aim at ſyſtem, but communicate my ideas in deſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory obſervations, under the general diviſions of AGRICULTURE, MANUFACTURES and COMMERCE.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>AGRICULTURE.</head>
               <p>AGRICULTURE is the original ſource, from whence the people derive their ſubſiſtence, comforts and conveniencies, and the foundation of the commerce and wealth of a nation. By cultivating and improving the face of a country, its real value is augmented; by the productions of the field, the people ſubſiſt and enjoy life; by furniſhing the manufacturer and arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan with materials for fabrication, proviſion is made for the ſupport of an increaſed number of inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and the people thereby ſupplied with their conveniencies; and on agriculture does commerce de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, as its original ſupport. Agriculture ſhould therefore be conſidered as the firſt and moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant intereſt of a nation, and the moſt uſeful and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable of all profeſſions. And for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſupport of the agricultural intereſt of the United States, I would ſuggeſt the following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars. 1ſt. Every article which is produced in the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021774_0013_0FB59D94678245E8"/>United States ſhould be prohibited from other nations. Beef, butter, cheeſe, indigo and iron, are the natural productions of this country, and produced in ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent quantities for the uſe of the people throughout the ſtates, and for that reaſon ought to be prohibited. Nevertheleſs, beef and butter are imported from Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, cheeſe from England, iron frequently from Sweden, and indigo from the Weſt-Indies, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly prejudicial to the agricultural intereſt of the ſtates.</p>
               <p>In juſtification of the practice of importing theſe articles from abroad, it is ſaid that they are of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior quality. To this I would obſerve, that altho' ſome preference on this account might be given to thoſe articles of foreign production, yet, ſuch of them as are articles of conſumption, and produced in this country, are of a quality ſufficiently good to ſatisfy any reaſonable taſte. The others are of a quality of ſufficient goodneſs to anſwer all the neceſſary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes required of them; but even if they were not, they might be improved to any degree of perfection. All the productions of the United States might be ſo improved as to render them equally good with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of other countries, and no doubt would be, were ſuitable encouragement given.</p>
               <p>It is, I conceive, by the encouragement of having a certain market ſecured, and a price adequate to the goodneſs of commodities, that people are induced to make improvements. It tends to excite a ſpirit of emulation among them, and whenever that is properly excited, it will render the productions of America in the higheſt degree excellent in quality; for there is no natural or other inſuperable obſtacle in the way of it.</p>
               <p>A prohibition therefore on the importation of theſe articles from abroad, I conceive, would be proper, and a means of encouraging and ſupporting the agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultural intereſt of the United States.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:021774_0014_0FB59D9547C10BE0"/>
2d. Such articles as are not, but that <hi>might be</hi> produced in ſufficient quantities for the uſe and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of the people, ſhould be encouraged by duties laid on the like articles imported from abroad; or by bounties, or both, as circumſtances may require and render moſt adviſeable.</p>
               <p>There are three articles which come within this deſcription, and which I have ever thought to be of important conſideration. Theſe are ſilk, hemp and wine; all of which I conceive might be produced in this country to any requiſite quantity.</p>
               <p>By the experiments which have been made, it is found that ſilk may be cultivated in all, even the northern ſtates, and that to the <hi>greateſt advantage;</hi> particularly in theſe reſpects: 1ſt. It doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the intereſt or common buſineſs of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry. Mulberry trees may be planted in ſuch lands, and in ſuch a manner, as not to interfere with or preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice any other production; and children who are not capable of working in the field, may take care of the worms in every ſtage of their exiſtence. 2d. The time required to attend to the feeding of the worms is but trifling, compared with any other kind of agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural buſineſs. Six weeks is ſufficient to bring the production to maturity, and the neceſſary employment of that time, children will always conſider not a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtful ſervice, but an agreeable amuſement. And 3d. It is the moſt productive. Five or ſix children, with the advantage of a mulberry orchard, might produce ſilk ſufficient to clothe a family, with more eaſe than a family, with its common advantages, could produce wool and flax enough for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Without diminiſhing any of the uſual productions of the field, the culture of ſilk might very ſoon be increaſed to ſuch a degree in the United States, as to enable them to export manufactured ſilk in quantities equal to their preſent importations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:021774_0015_0FB59D9BDC44B1C0"/>
                  <hi>All</hi> the ſtates have more or leſs lands ſuitable for the cultivation of hemp; but the middle and ſouthern ſtates have abundance which might be improved in this culture to better advantage than in any other; and when we conſider the annual large importations of hemp, cordage and ſail-cloth, together with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing demand of theſe articles, by an increaſing navigation, and a ſtill farther increaſe in the demand, in conſequence of the eſtabliſhment of a navy, which will probably take place in ſome ſhort time, the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the culture of hemp muſt forcibly ſtrike the attention of every man.</p>
               <p>And with reſpect to the production of wine, it may be obſerved, that there is no country whoſe cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and ſoil are better adapted to the cultivation of grapes, than the ſouthern ſtates, and none under better advantages to carry it to a great extent.</p>
               <p>It is very poſſible that the population of this part of the country, and the conſequent productions of their preſent ſtaple commodities, will, in ſome ſhort time, outrun a profitable demand for them. In ſuch a caſe, to what could they turn their attention with more ſure proſpects of advantage to the public, and profit to themſelves, than making of wine? This is an article which cannot well be overdone; for the demand for wine is daily increaſing in this country, and many other countries are dependent, and always will be, for the wines which they conſume: So that the ſouthern ſtates would have no reaſon to apprehend a failure and diſappointment, let their exertions be ever ſo great in the cultivation of grapes, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of wines.</p>
               <p>The advantages which this country would derive from the cultivation of theſe articles, are many and important—of ſuch magnitude as to demand the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of every well-wiſher to the intereſt of the country, and the particular conſideration of the Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Legiſlature; and, as the culture of theſe lies out of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021774_0016_0FB59D9D17DC5660"/>the common road of huſbandry in this country, and the beſt methods of management, are perhaps not well underſtood, I apprehend, to charge a duty on the like articles imported from foreign nations, with a view of giving a preference in market to our own productions, would not be ſufficient to introduce and eſtabliſh them. It therefore appears to me, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miums might be propoſed with propriety, and a good proſpect of ſucceſs and public advantage.</p>
               <p>The particular mode of offering premiums, which I apprehend would be the moſt likely to produce a proper effect, and at the ſame time the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the circumſtances of the United States, is as follows, viz. For the greateſt quantity and beſt quality of hemp, produced by any one perſon or company, in either of the United States, in any one year, within twenty years, one thouſand pounds, for the ſecond greateſt quantity and beſt quality, five hundred pounds, for the third, &amp;c. two hundred pounds, and for the fourth, one hundred pounds; and the ſame for ſilk and for wine, made from foreign grapes cultivated in the States.</p>
               <p>Premiums of this amount would excite a ſpirit of emulation and rivalry among the people, the length of time would be ſufficient to make every neceſſary experiment and improvement, and not too long for that purpoſe, and by that time the public will proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be able to pay ſuch premiums. In the mean time alſo, the public would be doubly advantaged by the quantities, by that time already produced, and ſtill more ſo by the quantities which would ſucceed, for the cultivation of theſe being once eſtabliſhed, would never be ſuſpended.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. For the further encouragement and ſupport of the agricultural intereſt, good and ſafe markets for the productions of the country ſhould be ſecured by treaties of commerce, and by the moſt effectual meaſures in the power of the States to promote and protect their trade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:021774_0017_0FB59D9FD66AD0B8"/>
Congreſs hitherto has not been unmindful of this, and probably all that could be done under the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical embarraſſments of the States, hath been done; but it is hoped and expected, the preſent national government can do ſomething more for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of commerce.</p>
               <p>Agreeably however to the beſt political maxims, a market at home for the productions of the field, ought to be ſought in preference to one abroad, which are undoubtedly founded in reaſon and good policy; becauſe it preſuppoſes that in doing this a nation muſt neceſſarily increaſe its artiſans and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers, from whence are derived many additional public advantages.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>MANUFACTURES.</head>
               <p>THE public advantages derived from the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of manufactures, are greater in ſome reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects than can be derived from agriculture or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, particularly as manufactures are more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately and directly productive of wealth. The va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious articles of manufacture made uſe of by a people, amount to a much greater ſum than thoſe of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, including every luxury; conſequently were a nation ſo circumſtanced as to be obliged to make a choice, it would be found more advantageous to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to its manufactures, and depend on other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for its means of ſubſiſtence, than to ſupply it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with theſe and depend on other nations for its manufactures.</p>
               <p>An agricultural nation which exports its raw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and imports its manufactures, never can be opulent, becauſe every profitable advantage which can be derived from its productions is given into the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021774_0018_0FB59DA250FC3C70"/>hands of the manufacturing nation.—The amount of the profitable advantages thus given away, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not perhaps be preciſely aſcertained; but if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the uſual prices of the raw materials and the price of the general run of manufactures, we ſhall find that there is at leaſt a difference of three hundred per cent. The benefit therefore, of three hundred pounds on every one hundred pound, is given away by, and loſt to that nation which exports its natural productions and imports its manufactures.</p>
               <p>Neither can an agricultural nation become power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and that for this one plain reaſon, (without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending to a minute conſideration) the means of ſupport is, by importing its manufactures drawn out of the nation. This benefit of three hundred pounds on one hundred pounds, goes to the ſupport of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the manufacturing nation, and by that an importing nation deprives itſelf of the advantage of increaſing its inhabitants, in a proportion equal to the means of ſupport thus drawn away.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Connecticut</hi> is perhaps the beſt populated State in the Union, but it has arrived at its <hi>ne plus ultra.</hi> On its preſent ſyſtem, it will never be capable of ſupporting a greater number of inhabitants than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath done for many years back.—At the ſame time, if that State ſhould add manufactures to its agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,—ſupport a commerce on its improvements,— make returns in productive commodities, and on the whole, apply its natural reſources in the moſt judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious manner to the ſupport of its inhabitants, it might as eaſily ſupport eight hundred thouſand, as it doth now about two hundred thouſand inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Some countries are ſo circumſtanced as not to he capable of manufacturing;—they have neither the materials or conveniencies;—to ſome of whom na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has been ſo bountiful as to ſupply theſe defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies with rich ſtaple productions; yet even ſuch countries can never be independent, opulent or
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021774_0019_0FB59DA7AD732990"/>powerful.—The preſent ſtate of the Weſt-India iſlands is aproof of this; their lands are fertile and their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions valuable, yet they are dependent on other countries for their neceſſary ſupplies, the balance of their trade is againſt them, and they are incapable without foreign aid and ſupport, to make a reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble defence. And the ſouthern States whoſe climate and ſoil are much in their favor, and whoſe produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are the moſt valuable of any of the States, are nevertheleſs dependent, embarraſſed, and by no means populous. The northern States, in all theſe reſpects have a preference, notwithſtanding the unfavourable difference in their climate and foil.</p>
               <p>That which will render a nation in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree opulent, is, its ſupplying and furniſhing itſelf, from its own reſources, and by its own labor and arts, all its neceſſaries, and a ſurplus for the ſupport of commerce. The amount of this ſurplus deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines the degree of wealth to which a nation may arrive.—A nation therefore like the United States, which does produce every neceſſary article of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence in a great abundance, which might produce and furniſh all of the eſſential materials for fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and manufacture, and which might introduce and ſupport every neceſſary art, ſhould undoubtedly have in view as its firſt object, the ſupplying itſelf with all its neceſſaries.—By this and by the ſurplus productions which the United States will always have for the ſupport of commerce, they may become per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the moſt independent, opulent and powerful nation that ever was known; for their reſources are equal to it, but by neglecting the uſeful arts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in the habit of importing their manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the States will remain dependent, impoveriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and embarraſſed, let their reſources and agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural productions be what they will.</p>
               <p>A nation in fact may produce all its neceſſary ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of ſubſiſtence,—it may increaſe its real value by
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021774_0020_0FB59DAC91278E48"/>cultivation and improvement,—it may carry on an extenſive trade, and it may be remarkable for induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; yet if it, at the ſame time depends on other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for its manufactures, it will never increaſe its circulating property, and conſequently will ſuffer all the inconveniences and diſtreſſes, which reſult from ſtraitened circumſtances.—The experience of this country ſufficiently proves and illuſtrate this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, without entering into a train of reaſoning and remark.</p>
               <p>As by a combination and mutual co-operation of the general intereſts of agriculture, manufactures and commerce, the wealth and power of a nation is promoted; ſo by the concurrence of a variety of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous circumſtances, contained in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſt of manufactures, the wealth and power of a nation receives more eſſential and important ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from this, than from either or both of the other general intereſts, they being detached therefrom:— As 1ſt, by manufactures the natural ſtrength of the nation is augmented. This I have juſt mentioned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but I would beg leave to bring it into view again. A moment's reflection will convince us of the importance of manufactures, conſidering it in this point of light.—How many perſons do the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of the United States ſupport in foreign na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who poſſibly may take up arms one day or another againſt them? The number cannot be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained with any degree of exactneſs, but it is ſo great as to merit conſideration; for whether the arms of theſe will ever in fact be employed againſt the States or not, it would undoubtedly be more prudent to ſupport ſo many citizens who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the national ſafety and defence, than to ſupport ſo many foreigners, whoſe ſervices could on no occaſion be claimed.—2d. By manufactures the circulating property is not only increaſed but retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is as neceſſary to the commercial life and
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021774_0021_0FB59DAFB1665CC0"/>vigour of a nation, as the blood is to the life and vigour of animals. A ſufficient quantity (to purſue the ſimile) will force its way to the ſmalleſt and moſt extenſive veſſel, giving it life and activity; while a deficiency in quantity will not only throw the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior parts but the whole body into a languiſhing condition. 3d. By manufactures, the productions of the field, thoſe eſpecially which are ſuitable for manufacturing, are rendered in the higheſt poſſible degree valuable. Manufacturing adds three fourths of the value of manufactured articles; conſequently muſt be conſidered a moſt important improvement on the productions of the country, and a ſure and moſt eligible means of augmenting the riches of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 4th. By manufactures, a more profitable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce can be ſupported, than by the natural produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the country. A cargo of manufactured mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize is immenſely more valuable, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence will make more advantageous returns than any cargoes the States can now export, except only the article of Indigo. 5th. By the ſupport of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures in the United States, returns in trade would be made, not as uſually have been made, not in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous and unprofitable merchandize, nor in arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles incapable of improvement, but in ſomething really valuable,—ſomething capable of improvement, —ſomething productive and accumulating,—ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in ſhort which will increaſe the wealth of the nation.</p>
               <p>The manufacturing intereſt therefore, of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States, is I conceive of ſuch importance, as to merit particular attention, and to excite the utmoſt exertions of every true friend to the country.</p>
               <p>The enemies to the real intereſt of the United States, or at leaſt thoſe who regard their own private intereſt in preference to every other conſideration, have ever ſuggeſted a number of objections to the eſtabliſhment of manufactures; as</p>

1ſt. That we can always purchaſe goods cheaper than can be manufactured in the country. This as relates to individuals may in part be true, but as it relates to the public, is by no means a fact. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual may purchaſe foreign manufactured goods, probably for leſs money than this country could at at this time afford to manufacture, many articles particularly, but this ſimple fact does by no means determine the matter in queſtion. The queſtion to be determined is not, <hi>which</hi> coſt moſt money, the manufactures of Europe or the manufactures of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica; but whether the money thus laid out in the purchaſe of foreign goods, coſt the country more than would have coſt by manufacturing the goods them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or not? To determine the queſtion juſtly, there is no other rule but a calculation of the labour beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>towed on the foreign goods bought, and the labour expended on the produce of the country, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured the money that purchaſed the goods; for the value of all productions muſt be traced up to this original ſtandard. If the queſtion be decided by this rule, which I think muſt be admitted as the only juſt one, then I conceive by two circumſtances it can be proved, that the United States pay much more for their neceſſary manufactures by importing them, than they would do by manufacturing themſelves; that is, they expend more labour on their produce for market, than would be neceſſary to expend on the manufactures which their produce purchaſes. The one is the balance of trade is greatly againſt them.—It is an induſtrious country and very produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, yet after exporting all the avails of its labour annually, a balance remains againſt it; this I know is occaſioned in part, by importing too many luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſuperfluous articles, nevertheleſs no country as induſtrious and productive as the United States, but would ſupply itſelf with all its neceſſaries, and all the luxuries made uſe of by the people, beſides
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021774_0023_0FB59DB282D82640"/>leaving a conſiderable ſurplus, if its labour was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in a direct manner to the ſupplying itſelf, or did it receive an adequate return.</p>
               <p>There is not more labour performed in Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, according to the number of inhabitants, than in the United States, probably not as much; and as a large or larger ſum in the ſame proportion is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended there for luxuries and ſuperfluities, yet, the balance of the trade of that nation is greatly in its favour, while that of the United States is greatly againſt them; for which I can aſſign no other reaſon but that which I juſt now mentioned, the labour performed in Great-Britain is well applied and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an adequate return; in the United States it is, and doth not.</p>
               <p>The other circumſtance in proof of the point in queſtion is, that from obſervation and the beſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, we know of no article of American pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſold in Europe, that neats twenty ſhillings, which did not coſt more labour than the ſame amount of manufactures received there in return.—How much more cannot be preciſely ſtated, but if we were to ſay double, it would not perhaps exceed the truth.</p>
               <p>Theſe circumſtances ſhew the reaſon why this country with all its fertility and induſtry, is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs embarraſſed and diſtreſſed; and proves at the ſame time, that were the labour which is performed in the United States, applied to the production of the neceſſary materials for manufacturing, and to manufacturing itſelf, it would be more publicly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous, than to apply it to the production of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain articles for foreign market, for the purpoſe of procuring their neceſſary manufactures.</p>
               <p>This objection however, let it have what weight it may, might be ſoon removed, by ſuitable encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſupport given to manufactures, by being eſtabliſhed on good and ſufficient capitals, by being
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021774_0024_0FB59DBF10925328"/>put under good regulations, by the increaſe of manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, by habit and uſe in the manufacturing arts, and by the increaſe of the materials for manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the price of manufactures would ſoon be reduced to a reaſonable ſtandard, many articles cheaper than can be imported.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. It hath frequently been mentioned by way of objection, that land being ſo cheap and eaſy to be obtained, people dependent on their labour for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, would ſo generally go into huſbandry as to render the ſupport of manufactories in the United States impracticable; but I conceive this objection is not well founded.</p>
               <p>Since the government is eſtabliſhing, and probably will finally be eſtabliſhed on a good and ſafe footing, and manufactures patronized, many manufacturers will migrate into this country; theſe people will never go into huſbandry; they underſtand nothing of it; their ſole object in coming into this country will be to enter into thoſe kinds of employment in which they have been educated and brought up, on a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of receiving better encouragement and ſupport here, than in their own country. Many have already come and as faſt as encouragement may be offered, or proſpect of ſucceſs appear, ſo faſt will the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories of the United States be ſupported by foreign workmen; beſides this, there are thouſands of youths in the States, ſuffering for ſuch kinds of employment as the different branches of manufacture would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford them.</p>
               <p>The creator and benefactor of men, hath in great wiſdom and goodneſs, ſo diverſified the natural abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, genius and diſpoſition of mankind, that they have a natural propenſity and turn of mind to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent occupations and employments, whereby their neceſſities and conveniencies are mutually provided for, and ſupplied. Huſbandry therefore is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by every one as an agreeable employment, nor
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021774_0025_0FB59DC0C3BF80D0"/>entered into by thoſe who have a natural propenſity to ſome other occupation, if ſuch could be found and entered into with proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>To this we may add another conſideration; the manufacturing buſineſs is not ſo laborious as field huſbandry, and productive of more advantage to a labourer, ſo that thoſe who have no lands of their own and nothing to depend on for a ſupport but their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, will undoubtedly, and in fact, ſuch always did prefer ſome kind of handicraft buſineſs to huſban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. It hath alſo been ſuggeſted by way of objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that manufactures would prejudice the agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and commercial intereſts of the United States. That it would leſſen the occaſion of trade, the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of importations being diminiſhed, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence would leſſen the demand for the uſual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the country—To this I would obſerve—</p>
               <p>That in proportion to the extent of manufactures, would be the increaſe of inhabitants, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the conſumption of the fruits of the earth, and in the ſame proportion would be the demand for the materials for manufacturing, which would be an advantageous ſubſtitute for many of the unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table productions of the country; for many of them are the reſult of neceſſity, and had much better be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended.—The increaſe in the home conſumption of the agricultural productions of the country, by the eſtabliſhment of manufactures, would I conceive be more than a counterbalance to a diminution in their demand in foreign markets in conſequence thereof; beſides ſuch of the productions of the United States as now find a profitable market abroad, will probably continue the ſame, let returns be made in what they will.</p>
               <p>The Weſt-India iſlands will always receive many ſupplies from the States, for they are dependent on this country for them. The European nations alſo
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021774_0026_0FB59DC25B836D30"/>will receive many articles of produce from the States, becauſe they can ſupply themſelves from hence on better terms than from any other country. In addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to theſe the trade juſt began in Aſia, together with that which might be eſtabliſhed on the coaſt of Africa, and that which may probably be opened up the Mediterranean, will altogether be fully ſufficient to take the ſurplus productions of the United States.</p>
               <p>But ſo far from commerce being injured by the eſtabliſhment of manufactures, it would derive eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential ſupports therefrom. Manufactures I conceive might ſoon be ſo increaſed in this country, as to ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it to export many articles of manufacture, which in every reſpect is preferable and far more profitable than the exportation of unimproved produce.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. Notwithſtanding the objections which have been and are ſtill made, by many to the eſtabliſhment of manufactures in the United States, yet I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive there are no obſtacles in the way but may be ſurmounted.</p>
               <p>Great-Britain was once under much greater diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, with reſpect to the introduction and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of manufactures, than the United States now are, yet by the judicious meaſures and ſpirited exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the government of that nation, it has over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come every difficulty; carried manufactures to an aſtoniſhing length and degree of perfection; and by that has become the moſt opulent and powerful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Europe.</p>
               <p>The United States are under better natural ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to manufacture than Great-Britain ever was, or ever will be; they have a greater variety of raw materials, which if not now, might very ſoon be increaſed to any requiſite quantity; they produce in a great abundance all the neceſſary articles of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, which is not always the caſe in Great-Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; there is not a manufacturing art in Europe but might readily be obtained, and with reſpect to work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:021774_0027_0FB59DC3F6771998"/>I apprehend as faſt as manufactures are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, workmen will be found and on reaſonable terms.</p>
               <p>There is therefore, I conceive no natural or inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perable obſtacle in the way of the eſtabliſhment, and ſucceſsful progreſs of manufactures in the United States; and the advantages of manufacturing are of of ſuch importance both to the nation as ſuch, and to individuals, that it certainly ought to be made an object of particular attention, and excite the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people in general, and of the national legiſlature. The patriotiſm of the people might do much, but without the aid of government, manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the United States will never be carried to any great extent, or arrive at a great degree of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Many meaſures I conceive might be taken both by individuals and by the government, for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſupport of the intereſt of manufactures in the ſtates.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. The eſtabliſhment of manufactures on good and ſufficient capitals is eſſential to their proſperity. Every branch of manufacture would be greatly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by this; but there are ſome could not be put into operation without great pecuniary aſſiſtance. A fear of failure has I apprehend hitherto deterred peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of property from attempting ſuch manufactures; but if the national government ſhould give ſuitable protection to manufactures which cannot be doubted, they will, it is to be hoped and expected, receive the aid of men of wealth. By ſupports of this kind the linen, woollen and cotton manufactures in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try might ſoon rival the European manufactures in their cheapneſs and quality, if not in their quantity; and I cannot but be of opinion from many facts which have fallen within the obſervation of every one, that thoſe gentlemen who have looſe property and have improved their money in trade becauſe they
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:021774_0028_0FB59DCCC01485E8"/>could not find a more profitable uſe to put it to, would have profited themſelves and benefited the public much more had they have turned their attention, and applied their money to the eſtabliſhment of manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.</p>
               <p>At the cloſe of the late war the trading part of the people and thoſe who entered into trade about that time, were poſſeſſed of money ſufficient to have eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed every neceſſary manufactory in the country, even at the high prices labour and materials then were, beſides furniſhing the people with their neceſſaries. Had this money been improved in this way it would have been retained and ſecured, at the ſame time a property as permanent and productive as the lands, which are eſteemed the moſt ſo. But it has been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported out of the country, and brought in return lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious, ſuperfluous and frivolous merchandize, moſt or all of which are now conſumed and periſhed, leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but a diſagreeable reflection of the miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of a property of great magnitude.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. Another ſupport which manufactures might receive from individuals, is the cultivation and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the neceſſary raw materials; this ſupport depends on the planters and huſbandmen, and two motives ought, I conceive, to ſtimulate them to exertions herein: the one is the public, and the other the private advantages which are to be derived from manufactures; ſetting aſide conſiderations of public advantage, it would undoubtedly be more to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate intereſt of individuals to exchange their raw pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions for home manufactures on terms of equality, than to throw away a great deal of labour in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of certain articles for foreign markets for the purpoſe of procuring foreign manufactures, which has always been done on terms of inequality.</p>
               <p>It is true, one of the moſt powerful incentives a planter or huſbandman could have to exertions in the cultivation of the neceſſary materials for manufactu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021774_0029_0FB59DCFD5DBF668"/>is a ſure and profitable market. Such a market depends on the ſupport and encouragement which the government may give to manufactures, and as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very poſſible encouragement and ſupport will undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly be given by the legiſlature, the planter and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman may begin with a good degree of aſſurance, to make the cultivation and production of the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing materials an object of attention.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. The particular meaſures which government might take and which I conceive are eſſential to the encouragement and ſupport of the manufacturing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the United States are—1ſt. To prohibit the importation of ſuch articles of manufacture as are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready furniſhed in ſufficient quantities for the uſe of the people—2d. To prohibit the importation of ſuch articles as might ſpecially be furniſhed, and which by a temporary deficiency the people would not be laid under any ſpecial inconvenience—3d. Such articles as might be ſoon furniſhed, and which would diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode the people, were they prohibited before ſupplies could be obtained from our own manufactories, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend ſhould be charged with ſuch a duty on their importation as would give a ſmall preference in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket to the productions of the United States—and 4th. Whenever any branch of manufacture arrives to ſuch a degree of perfection as to anſwer the purpoſes of the people, protect it by a total prohibition on the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the like foreign articles; even let it be in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of ever ſo trifling a conſideration, for many ſmall things in the courſe of time will amount to ſomething of importance.</p>
               <p>Under the two firſt deſcription of articles I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the following, viz—Anchors, axes, plantation hoes, ſcythes, caſt iron of all kinds, ſcale beams, ſteel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards, ſtoves, Engliſh ſteel, mounted ſwords, hangers and cutlaſſes, ſheer iron, bells of all deſcriptions, ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, bridles, ſhoes, boots, boot legs and foal leather; every other kind of leather manufactures, coaches and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:021774_0030_0FB59DD1B1D47C28"/>all kinds of carriages, fire engines, cabinet, joiners and turners work, walking ſticks and whips, billiard tables, backgammon tables, umbrellas clocks, jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellery, gold and ſilver plate, gauging rods, ſea com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſes, quadrants, cordage, burr mill-ſtones manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured, cyder, porter, ale, cordial waters, ſoap, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, lintſeed oil, paints ground in oil, refined ſugar, ſnuff, and all kinds of manufactured tobacco, ſtarch, muſtard, cloaths and millenery ready made up, bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, caſtor and felt hats, playing cards, paper hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, buckles of every kind, ſleeve-buttons, toys, bruſhes of every ſort, wool and cotton cards, tin ware, horn combs, muſical inſtruments, ſalt petre, probably ſeveral other articles which have eſcaped my recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; alſo, ſpelling-books, primers, pſalters, teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, perhaps bibles, together with a number of fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous articles, as bird cages, mouſe traps and the like; alſo, joiners tools in ſtocks.</p>
               <p>To this enumeration I would add a few remarks.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. I have frequently heard objections made to the laying prohibitions, becauſe as it is ſaid the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers in this country will take advantage of it and raiſe the price of their productions. To which I would obſerve, 1ſt. That if the United States ever intend to make manufactures an object, they muſt at one time or another lay prohibitions, for without, the manufactures of this country will not be ſufficiently encouraged; and whenever prohibitions do take place, this conſequence may poſſibly follow; but it will not be of long duration. By the encouragement of good prices, numbers will be influenced to enter into the manufacturing buſineſs; by numbers entering into the buſineſs their productions will be increaſed beyond an immediate demand, and as ſoon as this is the caſe the price of manufactures will be reduced to a reaſonable ſtandard—2d. Such an inconvenience to individuals will be of no prejudice to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the public; ſo much property will be in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:021774_0031_0FB59DD40F69C148"/>let it be in whoſe hands it will—3d. The advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to the public of acquiring property by the arts and induſtry of the people, which eventually benefits every individual, are by a great difference more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant than the diſadvantages of giving a ſmall ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in the price of their neceſſary manufactures. The objection therefore does dot appear to me to have a weight ſufficient to prevent ſuch prohibitions being laid as may be found neceſſary to encourage and ſupport the manufactures of the United States.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. It is probable it will be found neceſſary to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the importation of ſome of theſe articles into ſome of the ſtates while they are prohibited in others for reaſons already aſſigned; but on ſuch terms I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive as will encourage and ſupport home manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in all the ſtates.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. As it is of importance to mankind that the ſcriptures be preſerved and handed down to poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a ſtate of the greateſt purity, ſo I conceive it to be of conſequence that their publication in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try ſhould be under proper regulations. The editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons publiſhed in the ſtates, which I have ſeen, are faulty. Faulty and incorrect editions may and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed they tend to the introduction of eſſential errors. To prevent which, I would ſuggeſt as a queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it would not be proper that the publication of the ſcriptures or any parts of them ſhould not be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed and patented, and the preſs under the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a committee?</p>
               <p>Under the third deſcription of articles, I conſider ſail cloth and all kinds of hempen cloth, cotton cloths, woollen, linen and cotton hoſiery, iron ſhovels and ſpades, frying pans, braſs, copper and pewter manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures; fire arms, gunpowder, hand bellows, and paper, types, and probably ſome other articles which not at this time occur to me.</p>
               <p>Moſt or all our woollen and linen manufactures might very ſoon be performed in this country, with
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:021774_0032_0FB59DD69CE435B0"/>exertions, ſo alſo might our ironmongery and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery; but as they are neceſſary for the uſe and ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the people, and but few of theſe manufactures began; I conceive to charge them with a heavy duty at this time, would lay the people under a real hardſhip, without the proſpect of immediate advantage, as in the caſe of thoſe articles which I have enumerated; however when theſe, in any of their branches ſhall be ſo far advanced, as to afford a proſpect of their arriving at a point of importance, they ſhould receive the ſupport of government.</p>
               <p>Beſides the prohibitions and duties on articles of importation, I conceive there are ſome other public meaſures, which if adopted would tend eſſentially to the ſupport of the manufactures of the United States. Among ſeveral which might be ſuggeſted, I would mention the following:</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. A prohibition on the exportation of ſuch ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, as might be wholly manufactured in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; of ſuch I think of but one at preſent, and that is fur. All the fur collected in the country might, I apprehend be manufactured in it, if ſo, an advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of three or four hundred per cent, on the fur which is now exported, would be acquired and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. A free importation of ſuch articles as are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the ſupport and ſucceſsful progreſs of manufactures in the States, which are not produced in them, or not produced in ſufficient quantities, or of a quality ſufficiently good of ſuch articles, I reckon cotton. The culture of this article is increaſing faſt in the ſouthern States, and bids fair to render a prohibition on the importation of foreign cotton re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in a ſhort time, unleſs it ſhould be found of advantage to mix foreign cotton with it, but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent an importation may be neceſſary. To this may be added fine wool, until at leaſt the breed of ſheep is improved in this country,—alſo hemp, until the
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:021774_0033_0FB59DDD64198BF0"/>cultivation of this article becomes more extenſive in the States, together with allum, copperas, ſulphur, tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates, pewter, lead, braſs, copper, paints not ground, except lampblack, burr ſtones, dying woods and all kind of dyes, except indigo, mahogany, lignumvitae, ebony, box wood, elephants teeth, perhaps hides,— alſo machines, new conſtructed inſtruments, &amp;c. for the improvement of agriculture and manufactures, and for the benefit of the arts and ſciences.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. Some ſpecial encouragements for the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch manufacturing arts as are not generally known; ſuch offers I conceive might be made, as would introduce into the States, every manufacturing ſecret in Europe.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. Some exemptions with reſpect to taxes, gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to manufactories and to manufacturers; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of this nature have a great influence on the minds of artificers and labourers, much more than on their property. The very idea of patronage gives life and vigor to induſtry and the arts. It ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulates the people to exertions, and throws a chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ray on the toilſome labour of their hands; and I know of no demonſtration of a public and general patronage of manufactures, more expreſſive than an exemption from taxes thoſe who are employed in the manufacturing buſineſs.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>COMMERCE.</head>
               <p>COMMERCE in its connections and influences is undoubtedly capable of producing a variety of important advantages to a nation, particularly in theſe reſpects: It provides a market for the ſurplus produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a country, which otherwiſe would be render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed uſeleſs and of no value: It furniſhes the people
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:021774_0034_0FB59DDEC501A978"/>with ſuch neceſſaries, comforts and conveniences, as their own country doth not furniſh and produce, and it gives employment and ſupport to a great number of people of various profeſſions and occupations: It is alſo the medium by which a nation accumulates wealth —Commerce therefore merits the encouragement and ſupport of government.</p>
               <p>But, although commerce is adapted to the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of public intereſt, and productive of many pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate benefits and advantages; yet, it may produce ruinous conſequences to a nation: for which reaſon, it is incumbent on the legiſlative authority, to reſtrain the licentious operations of commerce, to which it naturally tends, and ſo to regulate it as to render it ſubſervient to the general intereſt of the nation.</p>
               <p>If a free and open trade was admitted by all nations, it would, perhaps, promote the greateſt intereſt and happineſs of mankind, at leaſt, it is the opinion of many writers on the ſubject; but ſince moſt, or all nations keep their mercantile intereſt ſeparate—ſince they aim at engroſſing an unequal ſhare of commercial advantages—at ſecuring in a particular manner the advantages which reſult from their own ſituation and circumſtances, and of rivalling other nations; the idea of a free and unlimited trade is highly impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic and abſurd: The chain of a free and univerſal commercial intercourſe being once broken, by any one nation, every other nation included in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of correſpondence, is laid under an obligation thereby to ſecure their own intereſts, and retain their juſt ſhare of advantages.</p>
               <p>The nations of Europe, with whom the United States maintain a commercial intercourſe, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered their mercantile intereſt as wholly ſeparate from the intereſt of all other nations, and taken the moſt effectual meaſures to prevent others from parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating in the advantages which their ſituation and circumſtances afford. The United States therefore
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:021774_0035_0FB59DE05B9BC790"/>ought to adopt and eſtabliſh the ſame principles, and regulate their trade in ſuch a manner as to ſecure themſelves the commercial advantages which are to be derived from their circumſtances, and prevent other nations from taking ſuch prejudicial liberties as a licentious commerce unavoidably expoſes them to.</p>
               <p>There are certain objects, therefore, to which the commerce of the United States ought to be directed, and to which it ſhould be confined; as 1ſt. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a profitable and advantageous market for the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus productions of the country: 2d. To ſupply the people with ſuch neceſſaries as the country doth not furniſh: 3d. To give employment and ſupport to the merchant, mariner and mechanic: 4th. To increaſe the circulating property; and 5th. To become a baſis on which to eſtabliſh a national revenue.</p>
               <p>Theſe are objects which I conceive ſhould be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly attended to, and had in view in forming a ſyſtem of commercial regulations; and that I may communicate my ideas on this ſubject in the cleareſt and beſt manner, I would arrange them under the ſeveral particulars which I have here ſtated.</p>
               <p n="1">I. To procure an advantageous foreign market for the ſurplus productions of the country, is one benefit of commerce, and an object to be had in view in the commercial regulations.</p>
               <p>The firſt and moſt ſtriking idea which ariſes in our minds here, is, the obtaining the greateſt price for the productions of the country. The ſpirit of ſpeculation ſo prevalent among merchants, will always direct to a proper choice in this particular; and were it not for circumſtances connected therewith, the interference of government with reſpect to markets would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary. But when trade is under no legal reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the productions of the country at liberty to be exported to ſuch markets and in ſuch methods as are moſt agreeable to the intereſt, convenience and private views of individuals, notwithſtanding the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:021774_0036_0FB59DE877BA9DE8"/>greateſt prices are obtained, yet it will moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be attended with two conſequences extremely pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the intereſt of the nation; the one is with reſpect to the returns which are frequently ſuch as tend to interfere with and ſuppreſs the agricultural and manufacturing intereſts, and which are luxuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, frivolous and unprofitable; and the other is, it may and in fact often does contribute to the ſupport of rival intereſts in foreign nations; for which reaſons it appears to me that there is a neceſſity that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould not only preſcribe the mode of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, but direct the foreign markets to which the productions of the country may be exported.</p>
               <p>The particular meaſures which I conceive govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment might take to procure and promote a beneficial market for the productions of the country in foreign nations and countries are theſe, viz. 1ſt. To form treaties of friendſhip and commerce with ſuch nations, wherein there is a profitable demand for the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ſtates, and with whom a trade may be eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed on the principles of mutual advantage—2d. To remove the impediments out of the way of ſuch profitable markets as may be obſtructed—3d. To aid and aſſiſt the merchants in the eſtabliſhment of any new trade which may be found, and which may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire public ſupport—and 4th, To form ſuch regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations as would tend to ſupport the value of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of the United States in foreign markets. To theſe I would obſerve,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. That altho' the ſtates have entered into trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of friendſhip and trade with ſome of the Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an nations, in which a good market for many of their productions are found; yet with Great Britain where a great part of the produce of the ſtates go to for a market, and from whom the greater part of their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of manufactures are received, no treaty hath or could be entered into; the reaſon of which I conceive to be that Great Britain entertaining an opinion that
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:021774_0037_0FB59DEB98F92870"/>in conſequence of the broken ſtate of the American government, the difference in their local intereſts, the ſpirit of rivalry and jealouſy ſubſiſting between them, and the obligations the merchants of the ſtates were under to the merchants of that nation, no general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations ſuch as would render the commerce of the two countries reciprocally beneficial, would ever be adopted by the ſtates. Great Britain therefore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded on this idea, and preſcribed the terms and mode of trade between that nation and this, which are founded on the principles of a monopoly. All the proſits, all the advantages which are to be derived from the trade are ſecured to Great Britain; all the diſadvantages devolve on the ſtates. The advantages which Great Britain derives from the commerce of the United States in the mode in which it is now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on are many and important; and ſo long as they can be held, no propoſals for a treaty of commerce will I conceive be attended to by that nation; and I am humbly of opinion that nothing but the ſpirited and decided meaſures of the legiſlature of the United States will ever produce a treaty of commerce with Great Britain, or ſecure to the ſtates an equal ſhare of advantages in the commerce of the two countries.</p>
               <p>In general I would obſerve, that a trade carried on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two nations on ſufferance, is always precarious, liable to many impoſitions, and never reciprocally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous; for no two nations were ever ſo circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced as to maintain an equilibrium in the benefits of commerce, without ſtipulating the terms on which it ſhould be proſecuted: One will derive unequal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; the other in conſequence thereof will be ſubjected to proportional diſadvantages; for which reaſon I conceive a treaty of commerce ſhould in the firſt inſtance be formed and entered into by the United States, with thoſe nations in which an advantageous market for their productions may be found.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="39" facs="unknown:021774_0038_0FB59DED06BC0790"/>
2d. A profitable trade I apprehend might be carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by the United States up the Mediterranean, could a ſettlement, and a treaty of amity with the Dey of Algiers be effected; but as the depredations com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted on the navigation of the United States by the Algerines, were begun and are now ſupported by the intrigues, and through the influence of the Britiſh court, it will be a work of no ſmall difficulty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the peace and friendſhip of that piratical ſtate. The legiſlature of the United States however will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly continue attempts for the accompliſhment of ſo important an end, whereby the freedom and property of the citizens of the States may be ſecured, and a trade opened up the Mediterranean.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. An advantageous trade I conceive might be eſtabliſhed on the coaſt of Africa, particularly that part called the Gold Coaſt, where a profitable mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket might be found for the productions of the States; this country diſtilled rum particularly; and where alſo ſeveral valuable articles by way of return are to be had. But whether an extenſive and ſafe trade could be carried on there without eſtabliſhing factories, and they ſupported by the power of the States, I will not pretend to determine; neither will I pretend to ſay whether the States have it conveniently in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to ſupport factories on that coaſt, ſhould national ſupport be neceſſary. If however, it ſhould appear that an extenſive trade could be opened and carried on there, I ſhould imagine the government would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it an object worthy of attention, and as far as was in its power, give the trade every aid and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; for every new market which can be found for, and every new conſumer of the productions of the States, not only advances the intereſt of commerce in particular, but eventually promotes every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar intereſt of the nation, except in thoſe inſtances where a rival intereſt is ſupported thereby. Beſides, I know of no nation or country with whom the States
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:021774_0039_0FB59DEE81502E80"/>carry on a trade, where commodities in return are to be found more valuable.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. A profitable market for ſeveral of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the States, might be found in the Spaniſh American dominions, were it poſſible to obtain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for that purpoſe from the court of Spain. This however, can ſcarcely be hoped for, conſidering the policy of the Spaniſh nation with reſpect to its trade. It may nevertheleſs be worth while to attempt it, for there are certain times when nations, as well as indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, feel more liberally diſpoſed than is uſually the caſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. The trade juſt began to Aſia, might, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, be productive of many benefits to the States, were it proſecuted upon a judicious and well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed plan; but if my informations are to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended upon, and my ideas of the trade as it is now circumſtanced, juſt, I cannot think it beneficial to the States, or as lucrative to adventurers as ſuch a trade ought to be.</p>
               <p>There are among others, two objects to be kept in view as eſſential to the intereſt of this trade;—the one is the ſupport of the value of the produce of the States in the markets of Aſia, and the other is the quality of the merchandize received there in return.</p>
               <p>If the value of American produce exported, could be ſupported in ſuch a manner as to make profitable returns to the merchants, it would render the trade beneficial to the public; becauſe it would be the moſt direct and advantageous method by which the States could import the productions of Aſia; but if the produce of the States, fall in their price in ſuch a manner as to render the exportation of conſiderable ſums of money neceſſary, in order to make the voyages profitable, I apprehend no advantage accrues to the public by the trade: for in the firſt place I conceive the States cannot at this time export large ſums of money without diſtreſſing other intereſts, of
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:021774_0040_0FB59DF86DBDEA48"/>more conſequence than any, or all the luxuries of the Eaſt. Were there ſuch an influx of money into the States, that there was a danger of its depreciating in value, the exportation of money would be adviſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and neceſſary,—this however is not the caſe at preſent; or were the importations from Aſia neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, or applied to the ſupport and promotion of ſome other national intereſt, the exportation of money for the ſupport of the trade, might not be diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous; but this is not the caſe. The importations from that country are all of the luxurious kind; are incapable of improvement, and are not applied to the promotion of any other intereſt, or did the Aſiatic trade bring into the ſtates as much money as it carried out, no inconvenience to the public intereſt would ariſe by the exportation of money; but this alſo is not the caſe—The States have no foreign market for their importations from Aſia; the trade originates and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates within themſelves. In the ſecond place, as no freight can be made on money, the profits on the importation or returns muſt be augmented, in order to ſupport the merchant in the trade. This addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional profit muſt neceſſarily be drawn from the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the States, ſince no foreign market is opened for India goods through this channel.</p>
               <p>A ſupply of any kind of merchandize, more than ſufficient for the immediate uſe and conſumption of the people, will always be the occaſion of reducing their price in any market. This is a circumſtance com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all, for which reaſon ſuitable meaſures ought to be adopted to prevent, as far as poſſible, ſuch an inconvenience in voyages, as lengthy, expenſive and important as thoſe are from the United States to Aſia.</p>
               <p>The voyages from this country to that are wholly unconnected with one another; and conſequently the buſineſs of negociation is in the hands of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cargoes of each ſhip. The intereſt of each particular voyage is the object of the reſpective ſupercargoes;
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:021774_0041_0FB59DF9C10206B0"/>and of courſe a competition of intereſts naturally takes place between them. Diſpatch is with them a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of equal, or greater moment, than the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the value of the produce of this country, and a temporary private advantage of greater account than a permanent and durable public profit and intereſt. Theſe circumſtances, I conceive, have been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of American produce being ſold at a reduced price from time to time in the markets of Aſia, until, as I have been informed, it will not pay a freight in any meaſure equal to the length and expence of the voyage: And as there are no eſtabliſhed American factories in the ſea ports of Aſia—no well eſtabliſhed correſpondents in the country, and American cargoes ſold on the ſpot, on the beſt terms that can be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and cargoes received in return in ſuch articles as are at hand, and that can be the eaſieſt procured, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merchantable</hi> goods, ſuch as are refuſed at the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean factories, are in conſequence of theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances palmed upon the American merchants, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely prejudicial to the trade.</p>
               <p>I am by no means poſitive in my opinion reſpecting the Aſiatic trade, for it is founded on but tranſient information, and my own reflections on the ſubject; but until I am convinced by ſuperior evidence, I muſt think that if the trade from the United States to Aſia was a company concern, and the buſineſs in that country negociated by one ſet of merchants; or in any method which would unite the American mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile intereſt in Aſia, and render it the ſame, it would be a means of ſupporting the value of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can produce in thoſe markets, and of procuring in return merchandize of the beſt qualities; and theſe I conceive are objects of important conſideration in the trade. Nevertheleſs, admitting theſe remarks to be juſt, and that it would be poſſible to put the trade upon a more advantageous footing, I know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the government could conſtitutionally, or with
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:021774_0042_0FB59DFB4ADA7140"/>propriety interfere, or take any meaſures reſpecting it. If however it ſhould be found that any regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which government might form, would tend to keep an important branch of commerce from dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling into nothing—to reſtore it to its expected con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and to render it of public benefit, I ſhould imagine ſuch national meaſures as would anſwer theſe purpoſes, might with reaſon and propriety be taken.</p>
               <p n="2">II. To ſupply the people with ſuch <hi>neceſſary</hi> articles of produce and manufactures as their own country doth <hi>not</hi> furniſh, is one principal end and deſign of commerce.</p>
               <p>No man ever was or ever will be ſo independent as not to need aſſiſtance from his fellow creatures, or to render a commercial intercourſe unneceſſary; and the ſame mutual dependence which ſubſiſts between indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals in the ſame country, ſubſiſts between countries themſelves. No nation or country furniſhes every thing neceſſary to the comfort and convenience of its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, in ſuch a manner that the happineſs of the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of the reſpective countries could not be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by an exchange of their productions. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce therefore is eſſential to the intereſt and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mankind on this account. Beſides, it is the beſt calculated mean of promoting the intereſt of ſociety; but as this is foreign from my deſign, ſhall wave it.</p>
               <p>By an exchange of commodities, giving ſuch as an individual or a country produces in ſurplus quantities, and receiving by way of return ſuch as are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, and which are neceſſary to ſubſiſtence, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort and convenience, the happineſs of mankind is reciprocally promoted, and the original end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of commerce fully anſwered: And ſo long as the commerce of two nations or countries is carried on with this view, and confined within the limits of this rule, it anſwers its original and eſſential purpoſes. But whenever it breaks over this natural boundary— when no reſtrictions are laid on the importations into
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:021774_0043_0FB59DFD10B76F28"/>a country, and the emolument of individuals becomes the only object of trade, without regard to national welfare, it will neceſſarily and unavoidably produce prejudicial conſequences; and in proportion to the prejudices which one nation ſuffers by ſuch an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted commerce, will be the extraordinary advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages received by the other nation.</p>
               <p>We often overlook the influence and effect of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious trade on the intereſt of a nation, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we do not like to inveſtigate a ſubject of ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and complicated a nature, in which we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we have no immediate concern; or becauſe they are diffuſive, and not confined to any particular object. But, ſhould a wealthy planter in any part of the country, permit his children or ſervants to import from another part of the country, ſuch articles of produce as he produced himſelf, and ſupply his uſual cuſtomers and purchaſers therewith, the effect it would have on his intereſt would be ſtriking and obvious to every one: The effect and the cauſe would be clearly ſeen and underſtood by every man, and it would be a concluſion univerſally agreed in, that ſuch a man, continuing to permit ſuch a conduct, muſt in the end be inevitably ruined. This concluſion applies with equal force and juſtice to a nation that permits a licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious trade—that permits the importation of ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of produce and manufacture as it produces and manufactures itſelf. All the difference between a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and an individual conſiſts in this; in the one caſe, the prejudice is pointed and inſupportable; in the other, it is diffuſive, and by being borne by a nation, is ſupportable. And,</p>
               <p>If it be repugnant to the intereſt of a nation to import into it ſuch articles of produce and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as it actually <hi>doth</hi> furniſh, it muſt alſo in ſome degree be prejudicial to import freely ſuch articles as it <hi>might</hi> produce and manufacture; becauſe this would be cutting off a ſource of national wealth at the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:021774_0044_0FB59E06D8726470"/>head; it would be deſtroying a ſeed in the earth, which one day might have become a flouriſhing plant.</p>
               <p>But my idea in ſtating this rule or maxim, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends further, and aims at laying a reſtraint on the importation of foreign luxuries, and frivolous arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of merchandize, notwithſtanding the country may not furniſh them; becauſe they are <hi>not neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The free importation and unreſtrained uſe of ſuch articles, injures the intereſt of the country in a varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of reſpects. It tends to vitiate the taſte, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt the morals of the people; to enervate the ſinews of induſtry; to deſtroy that ſpirit of oeconomy which ought to be preſerved in the body of the people; to inſpire them with a ſpirit of vanity, and to excite an illaudable ambition of being diſtinguiſhed by pagean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and ſhew; to draw them inſenſibly into habits of diſſipation and profuſe expences; and it directly draws their hard earned and valuable property away for that which is of no real uſe to them.</p>
               <p>Were articles of luxury and ſuperfluity the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the country which conſumes them, one ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ill conſequence, as it reſpects the intereſt of the public, would not follow; which is, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding individuals might be ruined by a too free uſe of unneceſſary articles, ſtill the property would remain in the nation: But by freely importing from foreign nations, and making uſe of ſuch articles, the folly and loſs becomes national.</p>
               <p>In applying theſe general remarks to the commerce of the United States, ſince the revolution, it is to be obſerved, that the welfare of the nation, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience and happineſs of the people, have not been the objects aimed at by their trade, but the private advantage and profit of individuals: And as no le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal reſtrictions, have been laid on importations, not only neceſſary, but luxurious, trifling and uſeleſs ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles have been imported, and freely made uſe of; and the conſequence has been, poverty and diſtreſs among the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="46" facs="unknown:021774_0045_0FB59E08C31F35A8"/>
From among a great variety of luxurious and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary articles imported into the United States, I will ſelect one for particular conſideration; that is ardent ſpirits. The trifling duty laid on theſe by the different States, have laid no reſtraint on their uſe. They are within the reach of every one, and are as freely made uſe of as of the cheapeſt and moſt innocent drinks; and what are the conſequences? Perhaps half a milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of pounds in money and other property has annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally been drawn out of the States for rum, brandy and geneva. Many who might have been uſeful members of ſociety, have become by the intoxicating draught, perfect brutes—loſt to ſociety—loſt to their friends and connections, and loſt to themſelves. We fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſerve idleneſs and diſſipation—families re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to infamy and diſtreſs—riots, quarrels and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders—a good conſtitution deſtroyed early in life, and perſons ſent prematurely to the grave, in conſequence of the free importation and unreſtrained uſe of ardent ſpirits.</p>
               <p>The United States is a young nation, and requires a great deal of induſtry and good oeconomy to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it independent and opulent: No nation therefore can be more eſſentially injured by a luxurious, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated habit of living; yet none expends ſo great a quantity of ſpirituous liquors, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of inhabitants, as the United States, and with leſs occaſion; for all the neceſſary drinks might be furniſhed within themſelves, in a great plenty and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient variety.</p>
               <p>Great-Britain is an old nation, and has become opulent; yet, were ſhe to admit of as free a uſe of ardent ſpirits as the United States, it would go nigh to ruining the agricultural and manufacturing inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of that nation. So ſenſible is Great-Britain of the ruinous conſequences of an unreſtrained uſe of ſpirituous liquors, that <hi>rum,</hi> the produce of their own iſlands, is charged with ſuch a duty, as to put it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of people in general.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="unknown:021774_0046_0FB59E0A4DF50B38"/>
As ſpirituous liquors are no ways neceſſary to the exiſtence, comfort or convenience of the people, but productive of ruinous conſequences to individuals, and prejudicial effects on the intereſts of the nation, ſuch a reſtraint, I conceive, ought to be put on their uſe, as would be ſufficient to leſſen it, and to turn the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the people to thoſe means and advantages which the country hath put into the hands of every man.</p>
               <p>A duty therefore ſo high as would produce this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſhould be laid on rum, brandy and geneva im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into the United States. For my own part I believe a duty of five or ſix ſhillings a gallon, would not be too much to anſwer the purpoſes intended thereby. Their prices would be raiſed in conſequence of ſuch a duty about two hundred per cent. and if the quantity made uſe of was to be leſſened in that proportion, it would be fully ſufficient to anſwer the people every neceſſary purpoſe. The man the moſt attached to ſpirituous liquors, muſt admit in his ſober moments, that one third of the rum, &amp;c. uſed by the people, is enough, and more than enough for their benefit. But, as the habits of the people will overpower reaſon, and as their virtue is too weak to produce a general reformation, the exertions of the powers of government becomes neceſſary to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are concerned in the rum trade, and import ſpirituous liquors, might ſuppoſe themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured ſhould ſuch a duty be laid; but two conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are worthy of notice here; the one is, that no good and ſufficient reaſon can be given, why a general and public evil ſhould be continued, merely becauſe ſome individuals are benefited by it; and the other is, the importer would not be ſo much injured as might at firſt be imagined: The ſmall duties now laid on rum, &amp;c. are in general a tax on the importer, not on the conſumer. Rum is ſold at about the ſame
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:021774_0047_0FB59E0BCBA78928"/>price it would have been, were there no duties laid on it; but if it was charged with a heavy duty, the importer would never think of giving it away: He would conſider it a part of the prime coſt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly compute his profits; and the duty in this caſe would fall where duties always ought to fall, viz. on the conſumer. Beſides this, if the importation of rum, &amp;c. ſhould be leſſened in conſequence of ſuch a duty, the demand would be greater than uſual; for, let the price be what it may, there will be thoſe who will purchaſe and make uſe of ſpirits; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the importation might be rendered as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable as by importing larger quantities.</p>
               <p>The importer might make another objection—That the rum, &amp;c. would not produce money ſufficient to pay ſuch a duty. In this caſe, if he had no other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of procuring money for that purpoſe, he would import money with the rum, &amp;c. and, as I juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, conſider it a part of the prime coſt. By this the importer would ſuffer no inconvenience, and the public derive an additional advantage.</p>
               <p>Another objection might alſo be made—That leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the importation of theſe articles, would leſſen the demand for the produce of the country. This I will admit, ſo far as to the ſtaves and hoops which would be neceſſary to make caſks for the rum imported. But to this I would obſerve, that if the lands and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of the people produces nothing in return more valuable and publicly beneficial than ſpirituous liquors, it would be much more to the benefit of the people to lay aſide ſuch productions, and turn their attention to ſomething more profitable and advantageous.</p>
               <p>Ever ſince I can remember, and long before, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> has puſhed a trade with the Weſt-Indies, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting horſes, and importing rum as a principal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of return. In this trade, I apprehend, a large ſum hath annually been ſunk. For, in the firſt place, the horſe, at the time it is ſold for exportation, hath

I reckon every horſe exported and returned in rum, as ſo much property loſt to the general intereſt; and who the individual is that makes any advantage by raiſing and exporting horſes, I know not; it is evidently not the farmer, and as certainly not the merchant; not one in ten ever made any thing by it, and at leaſt five out of that number have been ruined by purſuing the trade.</p>
               <p>Were the people to turn their attention to raiſing of ſheep and the cultivation of the neceſſary materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for manufacturing, and give manufactures the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſupport, inſtead of raiſing horſes for exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the production of other commodities for the purchaſe of rum, they would ſoon find themſelves in the event eſſentially beneficial; beſides the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of reflecting on the advantages which the general intereſts of the nation would derive from their patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otic exertions.</p>
               <p>The importation of wines I do not conſider as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſuch prejudicial conſequences as of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſpirits; wines are not ſo intoxicating—are not ſo deſtructive to the conſtitution, and coming at a higher price are not ſo generally made uſe of. For theſe reaſons—I do not think ſo high a duty ſhould be laid on them as on rum, brandy and geneva.</p>
               <p>Beſides ſpirituous liquors, there are a variety of lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious and frivolous articles of merchandize imported into the ſtates, in the higheſt degree unneceſſary. Theſe being the produce and manufacture of foreign nations, the people are extremely unwiſe in making a general and liberal uſe of them. In doing this they give a great deal of valuable and hard earned proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty away for things of no real value; and while they thus impoveriſh themſelves they contribute largely to the emolument of other nations, who poſſibly one day or another may ſcourge the ſtates with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:021774_0049_0FB59E1577B1ACD8"/>which they now profuſely give them for conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of little worth. Motives of patriotiſm and of policy ought to induce the people to oeconomiſe bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. However, as conſiderations of public utility and benefit have little or no influence on the minds of thoſe whoſe views centre in themſelves, and whoſe objects are the gratification of their vanity and their apperites; and as the people have been long habitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the uſe of many ſuperſluous and frivolous ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of foreign produce and manufacture, it will probably be thought not adviſable to lay a prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their importation; but I conceive a higher duty ſhould be laid on them than on neceſſary arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; and that for two reaſons—the one of which is, it would tend to leſſen their uſe and importation; and the other is, they are a proper medium, by which to apply to the pockets of the rich and opulent for mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the ſervices of the public.</p>
               <p>Such hath been the perplexed ſituation of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the United States, that no ſyſtem or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form rule reſpecting their importations could be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and eſtabliſhed by legiſlative authority; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' it is a maxim with many that trade will regulate itſelf, yet the experience of this country teaches us that views of private advantage with the merchants, often-times carry them beyond the intereſt of the public, and in many inſtances puſhes them beyond their own; ſo that no rule ſuch as would beſt promote the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic welfare, can ever be expected will be adopted by the merchants or take place in the common courſe of mercantile buſineſs; and indeed the experience of all commercial nations proves that the intereſt and views of individuals are ſo diſcordant among themſelves, and in many inſtances and many reſpects ſo oppoſed to the intereſt of the whole with reſpect to importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a particular manner, that to ſuffer the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of a nation to be proſecuted under the idea of its regulating itſelf, it would be the means of ruining
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:021774_0050_0FB59E18CABACF98"/>the merchants and of injuring in a ſpecial manner the national intereſt and welfare; trade never regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated itſelf except with reſpect to the prices of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize in market.</p>
               <p>The natural ſources of the wealth of the United States, and the general intereſts of the people therefore require the aid of the powers of government for their encouragement, ſupport and protection; by confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning importations from foreign nations to ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary articles of produce and manufacture as the ſtates do not furniſh. By laying a reſtraint on the too free importation of ſuch articles of produce, but eſpecially manufactures, as the ſtates are capable of producing and manufacturing, that they may have an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being brought forward; and on the too free importation and uſe of foreign luxuries and frivoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p n="3">III. To give employment and ſupport to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, mariner, mechanic, &amp;c. is another end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of commerce, and an object to be had in view in forming the general regulations of trade.</p>
               <p>The private emoluments of trade are of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, and as they are of a diffuſive nature and go to the ſupport of a conſiderable proportion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, who as ſeamen, mechanics and labourers depend on the merchants for employment; and as the acquiſitions of commerce are drawn out of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of the people, it is a matter of eſſential differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence whether the profits of trade are acquired by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners, drawn out of the country and applied to the ſupport of the ſubjects of foreign nations, or whether they are acquired by the ſubjects or citizens of the ſtates, and by that means retained, added to the ſtock of national wealth, and applied to the ſupport of thoſe citizens who are dependent on commerce for employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>This is an object which it appears to me the ſtates have hitherto entirely overlooked; for they have
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:021774_0051_0FB59E1B8912EBF8"/>ſeemed to vie with each other in granting encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to foreign merchants to reſide and eſtabliſh mercantile houſes in them. Some few circumſcribed and unimportant benefits reſult to a mercantile town by crouding it with merchants; but no general and national advantages are derived from an unneceſſary number of merchants, even if they are ſubjects or ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens. But the advantages of increaſing foreign merchants in a country or a town, are by no means equal to the diſadvantages which ſmally take place. They circulate a little money it is true among the people in the courſe of buſineſs; but this is no more than the merchants of the ſtates would do. They ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire property by trade out of the induſtry of the people, and draw it out of the country into other nations. This the merchants of the ſtates would <hi>not</hi> do; whatever property they acquired would be retained, which in its revolutions would revert back to the benefit of thoſe who produced the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by their labour. Wherein then conſiſts the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of employing foreigners in the commercial buſineſs of the United States? For my own part, I muſt confeſs whether it proceeds from ignorance or prejudice, or not, I cannot ſee any advantage in it; but on the other hand I ſee, or at leaſt imagine I ſee, numberleſs important diſadvantages and prejudicial conſequences flowing therefrom. Neither can I ſee any <hi>neceſſity</hi> for it. The ſtates require nothing more of their merchants than to exchange their ſurplus productions for ſuch articles of foreign production as they need on the beſt and moſt advantageous terms; and ſurely there are men enough in the ſtates of ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient property and competent knowledge and ſkill in mercantile matters, to tranſact all the neceſſary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial buſineſs of the ſtates; men who are natives of the country—who have no attachments to any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—who would retain all the emoluments of trade, and apply them to the benefit of the citizens; then
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:021774_0052_0FB59E1D0794FE88"/>certainly there can be no neceſſity or ſpecial reaſon for calling in the aid and aſſiſtance of foreign mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants.</p>
               <p>Were the foreign mercantile houſes eſtabliſhed in the United States, but few in number, it would ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly demand a ſerious conſideration; but this is not the caſe; moſt of the ſtates have foreign merchants reſiding in them, and in the ſouthern ſtates the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er part of their mercantile buſineſs is engroſſed by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners; conſequently moſt of the acquiſitions of property by the commerce of theſe ſtates is drawn out of the country into foreign nations. What the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual amount of this is cannot be aſcertained; but when we conſider the quantity of goods ſold by fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign merchants, the advance price generally put on them together with the amount of freights, which in this courſe of trade is naturally ſecured to foreign ſhips, we muſt be convinced that it is of magnitude and worthy of attention.</p>
               <p>Great Britain by the meaſures which it has taken through the indulgence of the ſtates, and I believe I may juſtly add their ill policy, has engroſſed and ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red every profitable advantage which is to be derived from the commerce of the ſtates. From the avails of the labour of our huſbandmen does Great Britain derive ſupport for her merchants, manufacturers and ſeamen. They are literally hewers of wood and drawers of water to that nation, and in conſequence of this ſervile and humiliating ſtate of trade, the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States are left deſtitute of the means of ſupport; many of their merchants have been crouded out of buſineſs and bankrupted; many of their ſeaman have either been forced from home or reduced to the neceſſity of begging the moſt ſervile offices on ſhore; and thouſands of mechanics have been driven abroad to ſolicit that ſupport from foreign nations which their own country could not afford them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="unknown:021774_0053_0FB59E1EA8E11E50"/>
Such indulgencies and ſuch a preference ought not to be granted by the United States to any nation whatever. To Great Britain the laſt. Every man of common underſtanding throughout the ſtates muſt know that Great Britain as a nation is an enemy to this country, and is making uſe of every means in its power to ruin the intereſts of the United States, and to bring about an opportunity of re-eſtabliſhing a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over them. The apparent friendly diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which may have been ſhewn by the nation, are but the ſmiles of a falſe friend; ſo long as the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges which are now derived from the commerce of the United States ſhall be continued to Great Britain, ſo long may its ſpirit of enmity be reſtrained within bounds; but no longer after ſuch monopolizing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages ceaſe, than until a favorable opportunity of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of employing its power againſt the ſtates with a good proſpect of ſucceſs. And I believe it would not be doing violence to truth were I to add, that the ſame ſpirit of prejudice and enmity which prevails in the Britiſh nation, predominates in the breaſt of moſt if not every Britiſh merchant reſiding in the ſtates; the number of whom is ſo great, that ſhould the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try be again involved in a war, it would find a formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable enemy where it ought to look for friends and ſupports.</p>
               <p>I would not be underſtood to mean by this that every Britiſh merchant reſiding in the ſtates is ſuch an enemy as to be anxious for an opportunity of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſword on their citizens. Mercantile connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons will for a time, ſo long as private intereſt can be promoted thereby, ſheath the ſword of the bittereſt enemy. But it cannot be ſuppoſed that theſe people have the intereſt and welfare of the United States in view as an object. Their view primarily is to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance their own private intereſt; and ſecondarily is to promote the intereſt of the nation to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. Their friendſhip therefore, I was going to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:021774_0054_0FB59E2180A6E2A8"/>would be co-exiſtent and co-equal with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits they derive from the country, but the events of the late war prove the contrary.</p>
               <p>It muſt I apprehend, be deemed by every man who duly conſiders the ſubject, extremely unwiſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic for the United States to throw ſuch pecuniary advantages as they have done into the hands of Great Britain, who is a known and avowed enemy to their intereſts and political exiſtence, and the continuance of whoſe peaceable diſpoſition depending on contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies, cannot be relied upon.</p>
               <p>I entertain moreover an opinion that giving ſo much of the mercantile intereſt of the ſtates as is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en into the hands of the Britiſh merchants, has had, and will continue to have, an ill influence on the poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the nation.</p>
               <p>In republican governments public meaſures are much under the influence of popular clamour, which is often excited and carried to a great height by men of intrigue. Merchants by their knowledge of men and things—by the weight which property gives them, and by an influence over the minds of the people in conſequence of mercantile connections, dependencies, obligations, acquaintance, &amp;c. are better qualified for, and in fact often do influence the people, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite popular clamour than any other claſs of men. To give therefore ſuch a weight and importance to foreigners in the mercantile intereſt of the nation as would enable them by intrigue to injure it in its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical views and intereſts, is in my humble opinion putting the intereſt, tranquility and ſafety of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States at too great a hazard.</p>
               <p>If my ideas on this point are juſt, and I have fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repreſented it, the queſtion which naturally ariſes thereupon is, how this ſtate of the trade of the United States is to be altered and the inconveniencies reſulting therefrom to be remedied? In anſwer to which I would obſerve that I would not pretend to determine how
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:021774_0055_0FB59E2A0209D1F0"/>the meaſures which I ſhould ſuggeſt would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the treaties of commerce now ſubſiſting between the United States and ſeveral nations, but as there is no treaty of commerce between the ſtates and Great Britain, there can be no legal impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the way of it with reſpect to that nation. The meaſure I would ſuggeſt in this caſe is that no fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner be permitted to eſtabliſh a mercantile houſe in the United States or tranſact any mercantile buſineſs in the ſtates, except as a ſupercargo or tranſient merchant, until he ſhall have firſt become a citizen agreeable to the laws of naturalization; and that no merchant of the United States be permitted to be connected with any foreign merchant or mercantile houſe, either as a partner, agent or factor.</p>
               <p>The ill effects of ſuch reſtrictions on account of which objections might be made, I conceive would be that in ſome of the ſtates the preſent courſe of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs would be interrupted and the people laid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome inconveniencies in the ſale of their produce, and poſſibly in the procuring their neceſſary ſupplies; but I apprehend theſe inconveniencies would be but temporary; trade would ſoon ſettle in a regular channel. In thoſe ſtates where there is a deficiency in their native merchants, there are nevertheleſs men of integrity and knowledge ſufficient to tranſact all their neceſſary mercantile buſineſs, and if ſuch ſhould need pecuniary aſſiſtance there are men of property enough in all the ſtates to ſupport their commercial it tereſts by affording the neceſſary aids to their own merchants ſhould ſuch be requiſite.</p>
               <p>The ſalutary and beneficial effects of ſuch meaſures would be that the profits acquired by merchandize would be retained in the country; the improvement of American ſhips in the freighting buſineſs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and the American merchant, ſeaman and tradeſman find employment and ſupport.</p>

IV. To increaſe the circulating property of a nation, is another intention of commerce, and an object in the general regulations of trade.</p>
               <p>As the balance of the trade of the United States hath ever, on the whole, been againſt them, this max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im or rule, in its application to the commerce of the States, has in view as its firſt object, the turning the balance of trade in their favour.</p>
               <p>The balance of trade being againſt the United States, diſtreſſing conſequences have followed. The circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting property having annually been drawn out of the country, has left it deſtitute of the means of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying the national treaſury; has put it out of the power of the debtor to pay his debts; has diſtreſſed and embarraſſed the merchant in the proſecution of his buſineſs; has reduced real property to trifling conſiderations in money, and been the occaſion of throwing a great deal of real property into the hands of foreigners, from whence has aroſe an additional prejudicial conſequence, which is, that a large ſum of money is annually drawn out of the States for rents. To turn the balance of trade therefore in favour of the United States, and relieve them from the embarraſſments and diſtreſſes which have taken place in conſequence of the balance of trade being againſt them, is an object of intereſting importance to their welfare, and demands particular attention, and the moſt ſtrenuous exertions.</p>
               <p>From the firſt ſettlement of the country, down to the revolution, there was ſome kind of neceſſity for a credit in Great Britain; becauſe but very few ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were manufactured, and at various periods, the produce of the country was not ſufficient to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the people with their neceſſaries, without ſuch an anticipation, and as the States were then a part of the Britiſh empire, no public injury reſulted there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from. But ſince the independency of the States, and the ſeparation of their intereſts from the intereſts
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:021774_0057_0FB59E2CD247CF40"/>of every other nation, they can depend on no other reſources, but what they find within themſelves, to counterbalance the injury which they ſuſtain by ſuch a ſtate of their trade.</p>
               <p>A queſtion therefore very naturally riſes in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of this point, neceſſary to be determined before we proceed far, and that is, whether the ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of the trade of the United States being againſt them at this period, is the effect of neceſſity? For, if it be the conſequence of an unavoidable neceſſity, nothing further need be ſaid about it; it is an evil which muſt be ſubmitted to, and borne.</p>
               <p>This queſtion is to be determined by the deciſion of another, which, though the ſame in ſubſtance, is a little different with reſpect to order; and that is, whether the produce of the United States exported to foreign markets, is ſufficient to purchaſe thoſe articles of foreign produce and manufacture, which are neceſſary for the uſe and conſumption of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? It is not in my power at preſent, to make thoſe accurate calculations, which would be neceſſary to determine the queſtion with preciſion, but from general appearances, and common obſervations, I think, we cannot miſtake in the concluſion.</p>
               <p>When we come to detach from the uſual importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the States, articles of luxury and ſuperfluity in no reſpect neceſſary. Articles which are, and might be produced and manufactured, and thoſe which have for years been lying unfold, on which an intereſt probably hath annually been paid. And when, in addition to theſe we conſider the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing ſpirit of late excited in the country, we ſhall find ſufficient reaſon to conclude, that whatever neceſſity the country may formerly have been under to anticipate their productions, at this time, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce which is exported, is ſufficient to procure in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, every article of foreign produce and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, neceſſarily wanted by the people, and to leave
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:021774_0058_0FB59E2E4B8C38F8"/>a balance of conſiderable conſequence. If ſo, there is no real neceſſity for the balance of the trade of the United States being againſt them, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly no prejudice could ariſe to the States, as a nation, or to any individual (except ſpeculators) were their importations, confined within the bounds of their exportations. But even if this was not the caſe, if the exportations of the States were not fully ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to procure every article which may be ſuppoſed neceſſary, the prejudice done to the common inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the nation by incurring an annual debt, is far greater than any inconvenience the people would be laid under, by any ſmall deficiencies which might happen in their neceſſary ſupplies.</p>
               <p>Another queſtion ariſes, which may be neceſſary to conſider; What are the principal original cauſes of the balance of the trade of the United States be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them? The cauſes, I conceive to be the monopolizing ſpirit of the Britiſh, and the mercen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary views of the American merchants.</p>
               <p>The Britiſh merchants, well aware of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the commerce of the United States, to the commercial intereſt of Great Britain, as ſoon as peace was reſtored to the two countries, in order to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand of the merchants of other nations, and to engroſs the trade, immediately eſtabliſhed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantile houſes in every part of the States, where an eſtabliſhment could be made to any advantage, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering at the ſame time, extenſive credit to the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican merchants. The merchants of the States avail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves of theſe offers, and imported, not only over ſupplies in neceſſary articles, but immenſe ſums in coſtly, ſuperfluous, and frivolous articles of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize; ſo that the country was at once, between them both, over-ſtocked with neceſſary, and unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary goods.</p>
               <p>The inconveniencies, and general injuries attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt exceſſive importations after the peace,
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:021774_0059_0FB59E352C180278"/>might have been ſurmounted, in a great meaſure, before this day, could importers of goods have ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed where they where, but they could not. Their aſſortment of goods ſoon became broken; a large amount lay unfold; and they were deeply in debt. In order therefore, to preſerve their cuſtom, to vend their unſaleable goods, and ſupport their buſineſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til events ſhould enable them to diſcharge their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, they have found themſelves under a neceſſity of continuing their importations. In conſequence of which, the balance of trade hath continued to be againſt the States.</p>
               <p>The importation of goods on credit, I conceive to be extremely prejudicial to the intereſt of the United States in a variety of particular reſpects.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. The view of the merchant in his importations, having ſuch an indulgence, is to get what property he can into his hands, in order to enlarge his buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he therefore, never conſults the intereſt and neceſſity of the people, but their humour and vanity, and accordingly, imports ſuch articles as he imagines will pleaſe their fancy, and ſell to a profit. Hence it is, that very large amounts in ſuperfluous and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous merchandize are annually imported, much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the neceſſity and abilities of the people. I know it is often ſaid, by way of palliation, that the people are under no obligation to purchaſe ſuperfluous and trifling goods, and thereby embarraſs their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, let there be ever ſo many in the country. This is true, and it is equally true that Eve was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no obligation to have received the fruit when offered her. The experience of all countries, and all ages, prove the irreſiſtable power of every kind of temptations. When the merchants therefore, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers the people ſuch kind of goods, as ſerve to grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy a ſpirit of vanity and oſtentation, offers them at low prices and on credit, which he is obliged to do, in order to get them off his hands, it becomes a
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:021774_0060_0FB59E39EDB5A900"/>temptation too mighty to be reſiſted; people will accept of the offers, and by that means, contribute to the public embarraſſments, by diſtreſſing their own intereſts in ſuch a manner (in many inſtances) that, as the final conſequences prove to be, it would have been much better for themſelves, and the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, had ſuch goods never have been ſeen. 2d. Goods imported on credit, come at an advanced price. The merchants in Europe always in fixing a price on the goods which they fell on credit, conſider the failures that may happen, as well as the difference between credit and prompt payment. This on the quantity of goods imported annually into the United States, amounts to a ſum of importance. And 3d. As there are but few inſtances of punctuality in the diſcharge of debts due from the merchants of the States, to the merchants in Europe, <hi>intereſt</hi> takes place—com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound intereſt ſucceeds, and in many inſtances, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſo long, that by the time an account is clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and the debt diſcharged, twice as much property is exported out, as was imported into the country.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding theſe obviouſly prejudicial cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which attend the importation of goods on credit, it is ſtrenuouſly inſiſted on by many that credit is of advantage, as it facilitates commerce.</p>
               <p>There are circumſtances, I will admit, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der credit not only <hi>not</hi> prejudicial, but advantageous. Domeſtic credit for inſtance, is no way detrimental to the intereſt of the public, becauſe the property ſtill remains in the nation, and it is very often of benefit to the intereſt of individuals. Foreign cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit alſo is of no diſadvantage, and often of public benefit, provided the property obtained on credit can be, and is improved in the advancement of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt at home, whereby the debt can be diſcharged, and a profit ſaved; or in the proſecution of ſome other foreign buſineſs, productive of advantages ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to counterbalance the diſadvantages attending
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:021774_0061_0FB59E3D17F77B98"/>the credit. The balance of the trade of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with ſome nations, is againſt her; but, as the property obtained on credit is made uſe of, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the advancement of ſome profitable intereſts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> which a profit is ſecured, it is ſo far from being an injury, that it contributes to national emolument. But to argue from hence, that the United States de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive an advantage from being credited with European manufactures, which are articles of uſe and conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are incapable of improvement, and which are not applied to the advancement of any other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable intereſt; and this credit to a greater amount than the productions of the country for exportation, to me, appears the heighth of abſurdity and falſe reaſoning.</p>
               <p>From theſe brief and deſultory remarks, I think we may rationally draw the following concluſions, viz. 1ſt. That the balance of trade being againſt the United States, they are (as a natural conſequence thereof) greatly embarraſſed and diſtreſſed, both in their public and private intereſts, and therefore, to alter this ſtate of trade, and turn the balance in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the States, the moſt effectual meaſures of government ſhould be adopted, together with the patriotic exertions of the people. 2d. The balance of trade againſt the ſtates is not the effect of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Their productions for foreign market being fully ſufficient to procure every neceſſary article or foreign produce and manufacture. 3d. The balance of trade againſt the States, originates in the private, mercenary views of the merchants, and is ſupported by the vanity of the people. 4th. So long as the Britiſh merchants are permitted to introduce whatever kind and quantity of goods they pleaſe into the States, and the merchants of the States to import goods on credit, without reſtraint, ſo long will the balance of trade remain againſt them. For the monopoliſing ſpirit of the Britiſh, and the ſpeculating ſpirit of the
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:021774_0062_0FB59E3E17B95D40"/>American merchants, would forever overrun the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources and productions of the country, let them be what they will. And 5th. On the whole we may draw this further concluſion, that as there are ſo many powerful, private intereſts and motives oppoſed to the true intereſts of the United States, in their trade, ſome decided meaſures become neceſſary to confine their imports within the bounds of their exports, and to turn the balance of trade in their favour.</p>
               <p>Several meaſures which might be taken would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to this end, and be attended with great and good effects; ſuch, as the encouragement and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of induſtry, oeconomy and the uſeful arts; a diſcouragement on the uſe of foreign luxuries and ſuperfluities, and a prohibition on the eſtabliſhment of foreign mercantile houſes. But after all this, one great cauſe of this national evil would ſtill remain. Suppoſe then (I propoſe it as a matter of queſtion) the national legiſlature ſhould paſs an act of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, viz. that from and after the term of five years, no debt contracted in Europe, for any kind of manufactures, ſhould be recoverable by law in the United States? What would be the probable effects of ſuch a law? Would it not ſtimulate the people to exertions in the manufacturing buſineſs? Would it not excite thoſe who are concerned in the European trade, to make ſuch preparations and arrangements, as to admit of the operation of the law without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience? And would not the idea of ſuch a law taking place at a fixed time, produce ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and preparations, as to render the execution of it unneceſſary? I ſhould ſuppoſe ſuch would be the effects, and I ſhould imagine alſo, that no preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of either a public, or private nature would take place in conſequence of it. For I think every man who conſiders the ſubject with any degree of atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, muſt be convinced that the productions of the country are ſufficient, and more than ſufficient to
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:021774_0063_0FB59E429270CB70"/>procure the people every neceſſary of foreign manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture, and that all that is neceſſary to reduce the importations of the States, within the circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of their exportations is, to alter the preſent courſe of the mercantile buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Whether ſuch a law in fact, would be the moſt elegible and proper to anſwer the neceſſary purpoſes, I will not take upon myſelf to determine; but I would obſerve, that a deſperate political evil, like a natural diſorder, requires a deſperate remedy, and on that ground, if no other, juſtifiable. To turn the balance of trade in favour of the United States, is a matter of the utmoſt conſequence to the future welfare of the nation; and could this point be once fixed, importations reſtrained within the compaſs of exportations, it would lay a foundation for the rapid increaſe of national wealth: For, if the States could once get rid of the expence of advance prices on their goods imported, of an intereſt which is annual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added, and of the inconveniencies which they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer on account of the ſums of money which are an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually drawn out for the rent of real property. If, in conſequence of ſuch reſtraints, the exertions and oeconomy of the people ſhould render a foreign credit unneceſſary; and the merchants were to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range their buſineſs in ſuch a manner as to export the produce of the States to the moſt advantageous markets; to purchaſe returns of the neceſſary kinds, at the loweſt prices, and with the feweſt incidental expences, the advantages would not ſtop at any one point, but be continually progreſſive.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, there are other meaſures which would tend to increaſe the wealth of the nation. One of which is, to ſecure the benefit of the freighting buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as far as it can be done conſiſtent with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting treaties of commerce, and the circumſtances of the ſeveral ſtates.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:021774_0064_0FB59E455369BA00"/>
A nation derives many benefits from commerce, but all the real profit which accrues by its trade, conſiſts in the freights made by its veſſels; the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage which a merchant makes in the ſale of the produce of the country in foreign markets, is ſeldom more than ſufficient to pay the freight and incidental charges; and the profits which he makes on returns are drawn from the people and not from any other nation. It adds nothing to the common ſtock; but freights outward, admitting a cargo, ſells for ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent profit to pay the freight, which is always to be ſuppoſed are drawn from the conſuming nation and becomes an accumulation of wealth to the nation the veſſel freighted belongs to; and freights home, if by the veſſels belonging to the importing nation altho' they are ultimately drawn from the people, yet the amount is retained; whereas if freights home are performed by foreign veſſels, the amount is drawn out and goes to the emolument of a foreign nation. The freighting buſineſs therefore is an object of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the United States and merits particular conſideration.</p>
               <p>From a falſe idea of freedom in trade, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it as the foundation of national wealth, the ſtates have thrown the doors of their commerce open to all nations without limitation or reſtriction, the conſequence of which hath been the loſs of freights to their veſſels, together with all the eſſential advantages of commerce. The United States have given greater indulgencies to foreigners in their trade than (I believe) are granted by any other nation. They permit a foreign ſhip to freight into their ports cargoes not only of the growth, produce and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of the nation or country to which they belong but of any other nation whatever. They permit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo foreign ſhips to freight out not only to the nation to which ſuch ſhips belong and their dependencies, but to any other nation or country, whereby the trade
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:021774_0065_0FB59E46A0FFEFE0"/>to divers free ports opened for the reception of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican produce and the benefit of the United States, hath fallen into the hands of foreign, particularly Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh merchants, in a conſiderable degree, and become a new acquiſition to the commerce of Great Britain. Beſides theſe, the ſtates have indulged the Britiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo far in its illiberal and monopolizing humour as to permit it an unlimited, undefined and excluſive right to the enjoyment of all the advantages and emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luments of the trade between the United States and the Britiſh Weſt-India iſlands.</p>
               <p>Upon a conjectural calculation the freights between the United States and the Britiſh dominions in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, amount to more than 100,000<abbr>l.</abbr> annually, and from the ſouthern ports three quarters of the freights between this country and Europe is performed by Britiſh veſſels, together with a large proportion out of the northern ſtates. One third of the value of the produce thus freighted probably goes to the emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument of Great Britain under the denomination of freight, inſurance and incidental charges.</p>
               <p>To retain the advantages of the freighting buſineſs and to render it one means of increaſing the wealth of the nation in ſuch ways and methods as in the beſt and moſt eligible manner would accommodate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts and circumſtances of the different ſtates, will I conceive, be attended with no ſmall difficulty, for which reaſon I feel a diffidence in ſaying any thing on the ſubject; but as I have begun, I will proceed and give you my thoughts thereon; and in order to come at the moſt rational concluſions on this point, I would ſtate two or three facts.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. The United States have not ſhips at preſent ſufficient to freight the whole of their productions to market: but with what ſhips they already have they might freight much more than they do; and in three years time they might increaſe the number of their ſhips to ſuch a degree as to be able to freight the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:021774_0066_0FB59E4930C8A9A8"/>whole of their produce ſhould ſufficient encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſupport be given.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. There are American ſhips already built ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to freight into the United States every article of foreign produce and manufacture neceſſary for the people; and this ſervice they would perform were it ſecured to them, at leaſt as far as treaties of commerce would admit of.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. The Britiſh Weſt-India iſlands, Bermuda, &amp;c. are dependent on the United States for many of their neceſſary ſupplies. This dependence is founded in nature, and will exiſt as long as the countries exiſt.</p>
               <p>From this brief ſtatement of a few facts I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, 1ſt. That as there are not at this time Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſhips ſufficient to freight the whole of the produce of the United States to the European markets, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it would not be to the general intereſt to prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit the freighting of foreign ſhips, and I am much at a loſs to determine in my own mind, what judicious meaſure could be adopted, to give a proper prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to American ſhips in the freighting buſineſs. If any extraordinary impoſitions ſhould be laid on Britiſh veſſels, it would only produce retaliating meaſures, and if a tax was laid on the freighter of a Britiſh ſhip, it would be a real hardſhip in all ſuch caſes, where American ſhips could not be obtained; ſo that it appears to me, no poſitive preference by law can with propriety, or to public advantage be given. It muſt, I think, be left to the patriotiſm, and at the option of the people. But I conceive, ſuch regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as tend to deſtroy thoſe connections which blend the commercial intereſts of Great Britain, with thoſe of the United States, and to give the mercantile buſineſs into the hands of the merchants of the States, would at the ſame time, deſtroy the original cauſe of the great preference and employment which has been given to Britiſh ſhips, in the trade between the two nations. American merchants, having no
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:021774_0067_0FB59E50E3FA28C8"/>connections of intereſt with the merchants of Great Britain, would naturally give a preference to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſhips. An impoſition of duties on Britiſh ſhips I conceive, ought to be regulated by the laws of Great Britain; for extraordinary impoſitions and their conſequent retaliations, have neither end nor bounds.</p>
               <p>One meaſure which appears neceſſary to be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is, that Britiſh ſhips from Great Britain, or Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſhould be permitted to freight out of the United States to thoſe kingdoms only, and to no where elſe; becauſe, if they are permitted to freight even to their own American dominions, it would deſtroy the effect of ſuch regulations, as I apprehend, will be found neceſſary, reſpecting the trade between the States and the Britiſh dominions in America; and becauſe by circumſcribing the freights of Britiſh veſſels in ſuch a manner, other freights, which are now taken up by thoſe veſſels, will be reſerved for the veſſels of the United States.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. As the United States have now, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly always will have veſſels ſufficient to freight into them every neceſſary foreign production, the freights of foreign veſſels into the United States, ſhould be confined to the produce and manufactures of thoſe nations, to which they reſpectively belong. This would give ſome advantage to the navigation and trade of the States; for hitherto, foreign, particularly Britiſh veſſels, have freighted quantities of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize from various ports of other nations, whereby the freighting buſineſs of the States is greatly injured and not only the freighting intereſt in particular, but the mercantile intereſt in general; for, by this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, ſuch quantities of many kinds of merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize are at times introduced, as to reduce their price and render them unſaleable, whereby the merchants ſuffer great inconveniencies, and heavy damages.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:021774_0068_0FB59E53D2C15C70"/>
It is thought by many, I am ſenſible, that a great influx of goods into a country, and their conſequent low prices, is of public benefit. For my own part I think otherwiſe. The diminution of the prices of goods, is the occaſion of a proportional larger conſumption, very often to the extreme of licenciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo that it ſeldom happens, that the amount of the general expenditures of a nation, is much leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by goods being ſold at a reduced price. Beſides, the merchant muſt be eſſentially injured thereby, which I conceive is as prejudicial to the intereſt of a nation to do, as to injure the agricultural, or manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing intereſt. With equal propriety, might the merchant and mechanic affirm, that the intereſt of the nation was promoted by the value of the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the field being reduced in ſuch a manner, that the huſbandman could not ſupport and keep his intereſt good, as that the huſbandman ſhould aſſert the nation was growing rich, becauſe imported goods were ſo reduced in price, that in conſequence of it the merchant could not ſupport this buſineſs. The mercantile intereſt is of importance to a nation, and equally a ſupport to agriculture and manufactures, as they are to commerce. Thoſe foreign ſources there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of our ſupplies, whereby the freighting buſineſs of the veſſels of the United States is interfered with, and the merchants injured in the ſale and price of their merchandize, I conceive ought to be cut off by prohibiting the importation of the produce and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of any foreign nation or country, by a foreign veſſel, except thoſe that belong to the nation where ſuch commodities are produced and manufactured.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. As the Britiſh iſlands in America are depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on the United States for a variety of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſupplies, and as this dependence is founded in the nature of things, the States undoubtedly, have it in their power to preſcribe the mode in which they ſhall obtain ſupplies from hence. If Great Britain
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:021774_0069_0FB59E554288B650"/>ſhould continue to refuſe a treaty of commerce, and the admiſſion of American veſſels into thoſe ports, the States would have a right, as well as good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to take ſuch meaſures as eventually to produce a treaty, or ſecure to themſelves equal advantages in the trade.</p>
               <p>Should the United States prohibit the exportation of thoſe articles of produce, which are ſuitable for the Britiſh Weſt-India markets, in Britiſh bottoms, I apprehend they would be under the neceſſity of procuring their ſupplies from thoſe ports, where American produce in American veſſels are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. This was their mode of obtaining ſupplies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt prohibitory orders of the Britiſh miniſtry were iſſued, and had it not been for the imbecility of the American government, they never would have been given; or if given, would not have taken effect. And I conceive it to be a matter of very little or no conſequence to the commerce of the States, whether they freight their produce to, and deliver it in St. Euſtatius, or St. Chriſtophers, a freight is equally ſecured, which is the great object.</p>
               <p>But, as the ſouthern States make a great depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on Britiſh merchants and veſſels, to purchaſe and carry off their produce, and as a total prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this caſe might lay them under ſome tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary inconveniencies, I would ſuggeſt, whether to lay Britiſh veſſels from the Weſt-Indies, &amp;c. under the ſame reſtrictions that are laid on American veſſels going to Turk's-Iſland for ſalt, could not be proper, and as well adapted to the intereſt and circumſtances of the States, as any meaſure that would be propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. An American veſſel is admitted at Turk's-Iſland in ballaſt only, paying a tonnage of two ſhillings and ſix-pence ſterling.</p>
               <p>I apprehend, if ſuch a reſolution ſhould be laid, ſome veſſels would import money for the purchaſe of their cargoes; at the ſame time, it would diminiſh
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:021774_0070_0FB59E57836FBAF0"/>the number of Britiſh veſſels in the American trade, and open a door for the introduction of American veſſels into the buſineſs, without producing any imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate conſequences, which might be the caſe, ſhould the preſent courſe of buſineſs be violently, or ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly interrupted.</p>
               <p>It is, that the full effects of ſuch a reſtriction might be produced, that I conceive Britiſh veſſels from Great Britain and Ireland, ſhould not be permitted to freight out of the States to the Weſt-Indies, &amp;c.— Again,</p>
               <p>It appears to me to be extremely impolitic, and much againſt the intereſt of the United States, to contribute to the ſupport of rival intereſts, which, in ſome inſtances, they have hitherto done.</p>
               <p>Nova-Scotia is ſo ſituated and circumſtanced, that it is capable of rivaling the United States, in their ſhip-building and whale-fiſhery, with the ſupports which it derives from them; but without ſuch ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, I conceive, thoſe intereſts would never flouriſh in that province.</p>
               <p>Ship-building in the United States, both for their own ſervice, and foreign markets, is an object of importance, and an intereſt, which merits ſupport and protection: They cannot therefore, with any reaſon, or regard to their own intereſt, ſupply the deficiencies of other nations or States, in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as to enable them to prejudice this intereſt. Nova-Scotia has ſome advantages, and natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, well adapted to the intereſt of ſhip-building, yet, it is dependent for iron, carpenters and proviſions, particularly flour, for the ſupport of this, as well as other intereſts. Some carpenters, and ſome provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion may be had from Great-Britian and Ireland; but iron, and a full ſupply of carpenters, as well as proviſions, are drawn from the States.</p>
               <p>The States it is true derive ſome preſent advantages from ſupplying Nova-Scotia with proviſions and iron;
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:021774_0071_0FB59E58FA0C8CC8"/>and it may be a matter of queſtion, whether the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages or diſadvantages are the greater? To this I would obſerve, 1ſt. That Nova-Scotia is a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring rival power, and its inimical diſpoſition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the States avowed, and univerſally known. To contribute therefore to the increaſe of this power, and render it the more able to aſſiſt in diſturbing the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility, and endangering the ſafety of the States, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to me to be impolitic, and of ſufficient weight to ſupercede conſiderations of a trifling pecuniary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. 2d. If ſhip building in Nova-Scotia does not exceed its own ſervice and employment, no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice will reſult to the States therefrom: But if by the ſupplies of carpenters and proviſion received from the States, the price of labour ſhould be ſo reduced as to enable that province to build cheaper, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a preference on that account in the ſale of ſhips, the States would be prejudiced, and for that reaſon ſhould prohibit ſuch ſupports. This however, on the whole, conſidered independent of and detached from other intereſts, might admit of a doubt in the minds of ſome; but when we add to this the whale fiſhery, which flouriſhes in Nova-Scotia, by the ſupports in men and proviſion received from the States, I think it muſt manifeſtly appear that the intereſts of the United States are injured by the ſupplies afforded to that province.</p>
               <p>The whale fiſhery is an intereſt of importance to the States: It employs a great number of people; produces a conſiderable annual ſum out of the ſea, and always hath brought into the country large ſums in money. The little iſland of Nantucket, unimpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in itſelf, contributes as largely to the wealth of the nation as any ſpot of ground of its bigneſs in the United States, perhaps more ſo. It hath formerly employed about two hundred fail of veſſels; ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from four to five thouſand inhabitants, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced at a moderate computation, about forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:021774_0072_0FB59E62BAE93510"/>pounds ſterling annually, wholly by this buſineſs. At preſent the buſineſs is not ſo great, but is increaſing; and might with ſuitable encouragements and ſupports arrive at and exceed its former importance.</p>
               <p>Great-Britain before the revolution was the beſt, and indeed the only market this country had for its oil. But in order to ſuppreſs the intereſt of the States, and to ſupport Nova-Scotia in its rivalry, Great-Britain, ſince the peace, has charged oil imported from the States with ſuch a heavy duty, as to render the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket unprofitable. The continuation of this impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and other diſcouragements on the conſumption of oil imported from the States into Great-Britain, I apprehend, depends principally on one circumſtance, which is this; If the whaling buſineſs in Nova-Scotia ſhould bid fair to arrive at ſomething of conſequence, theſe diſcouragements will be continued; but if it ſhould dwindle into inſignificance, they will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved; for Great-Britain, if I am not miſtaken, is under a neceſſity of completing its ſupply of oil from America; at leaſt I know of no other foreign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources. And whether the whale fiſhery in Nova-Scotia flouriſhes or not, I apprehend depends on the views and meaſures of the States. Should they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit the exportation of proviſion, and the emigration of whalemen to Nova-Scotia, I conceive it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce it to a ſtate of unimportance.</p>
               <p>Some proviſion it produces, and ſome it may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port from Europe; but theſe ſupplies are precarious and inadequate to the ſupport of a great number of ſeamen and mechanics. Flour in a particular manner in Nova-Scotia is dependent on the States for. And,</p>
               <p>The knowledge neceſſary to proſecute the whale fiſhery to advantage, is on this ſide the Atlantic, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the people of the United States. Without a ſupport in whalemen from the States, Nova-Scotia would fail in this buſineſs. It is now carried on by the people from the States, and for its future ſupport
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:021774_0073_0FB59E65C8632010"/>and increaſe every artifice is made uſe of to draw whalemen away to that province.</p>
               <p>Whether it would be to the intereſt and advantage of the States to ſtop theſe ſupplies, may be fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, I conceive, by one conſideration only.</p>
               <p>The only advantage the States derive from ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the whale fiſhery in Nova-Scotia, conſiſts in the ſale of a little proviſion. Let us ſee what this amounts to. If that buſineſs ſhould fail in Nova-Scotia, a great part of the whalemen now employed there would probably return again to the States. The conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of proviſion would therefore be ſtill the ſame. Beſides, a whaleman's annual induſtry may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to amount, on an average, at thirty pounds ſterling; his conſumption of proviſion at not more than ten pounds. The States therefore would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire twenty pounds benefit by every whaleman ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in them, which they deprive themſelves of by ſupporting them in Nova-Scotia. From this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration it is evident that the United States injure themſelves much, in contributing to the ſupport of the whaling buſineſs in Nova-Scotia. And on the whole, when we conſider the amount of the benefits that the States derive from the ſupplies which they afford to Nova-Scotia, in mechanics, whalemen, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, &amp;c. and on the other hand, the prejudices reſulting therefrom to the intereſts of the States, by their rivalry in the whale fiſhery, and in ſhip build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and in conſequence thereof, the increaſe of a neighbouring inimical power, we ſhall find the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to bear no proportion to the diſadvantages.</p>
               <p>The United States, it is true, have no right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the advantages which Nova-Scotia de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives from its government, ſituation and natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources; but they undoubtedly have a good right to withhold ſuch ſupports as would enable Nova-Scotia to injure them.</p>
               <p>

Beſides theſe, Nova-Scotia derives other ſupports from the United States, which I conceive is prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to their intereſts. Fiſh of all kinds have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into the United States from that province: This is manifeſtly wrong, becauſe it deprives the cod fiſhery of the United States (which is an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant intereſt) of ſo much ſupport that ought to be given it, and contributes to the ſupport of a foreign intereſt, for which no good reaſon can be aſſigned. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of fiſh therefore of every kind from any fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign nation or country into the United States, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſhould be prohibited.</p>
               <p>The Weſt-India trade alſo, of Nova-Scotia, is greatly ſupported by the United States, particularly by the ſupplies of lumber which it receives from them. This is impolitic, becauſe every cargo of lumber furniſhed Nova-Scotia, deprives the States of a freight. But this will probably be conſidered in the regulations of trade between the United States and the Britiſh Weſt-India iſlands. If it ſhould be found proper to admit Britiſh veſſels from the Weſt-Indies, Bermuda, &amp;c. in ballaſt only, for the purpoſe of taking cargoes out of the States for thoſe iſlands, the ſame reaſons for this permiſſion I do not think will hold good with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the ſupplying Nova-Scotia with cargoes for the ſupport of its navigation, becauſe it interferes with the navigation of the United States. In ſhort, as the United States want nothing from Nova-Scotia, and Nova-Scotia wants nothing from them, but what in point of intereſt or policy is injurious to ſupply them with, I can ſee no reaſon for continuing any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intercourſe with that province.</p>
               <p>Furthermore—The States have a rival in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, where from the natural ſtate of things, it could not have been expected.</p>
               <p>Formerly the States were carriers for the Weſt-India Iſlands; but the table is now turned, and the Weſt-Indies have become carriers for the States; and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:021774_0075_0FB59E68DCEA5FD0"/>from the ſupport which the Britiſh merchants receive by the ſole enjoyment and benefit of the trade be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two countries, they are enabled not only to purchaſe and improve, but to build veſſels. Many have already been built, and many more are on hand.</p>
               <p>This is an object worthy of attention; for it would be much againſt the true intereſt of the States, and contrary to the natural order of things, for them to contribute to the ſupport of ſhip building, and the intereſt of navigation in the Weſt Indies.</p>
               <p n="5">V. A baſis on which to eſtabliſh a national reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, is one public advantage of commerce; and a material object in the general regulations of trade.</p>
               <p>Much money is required by all governments for national ſervices. The ſafety and welfare of the nation, and a due adminiſtration of juſtice, cannot be provided for and ſupported without. And although individuals may, and often do grudge the money they pay to the public, and conſider it a kind of oppreſſion, and ſo much money thrown away; yet, they ſhould conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the ſecurity and ſupport of private intereſt, depends on the ſupport and protection of the general intereſts of the nation; and therefore, whatever mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is required for and applied to theſe purpoſes, is but a contribution to the private intereſt of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals.</p>
               <p>Did the people rightly conſider this; did they thoroughly underſtand the intimate connection and mutual dependence ſubſiſting between the general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the nation, and the private intereſt of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, it would reconcile them to the neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations of commerce, and to any judicious ſyſtem of revenue which was calculated to draw money from them for public ſervices, upon principles of juſtice and equality, and in eligible rational modes.</p>
               <p>But it is neceſſary that the demands of government be proportionate to the abilities of the people, and the quantity of money in the nation. If a nation poſſeſſes
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:021774_0076_0FB59E70E59D9F98"/>no money, it is certain none can be collected—if there are but five millions of dollars among the peoples, it would be in vain to require ten millions. If the rich only have money, the rich only are to be applied to. Government in ſhort, muſt require money from thoſe who have it, and that in proportion to the quantity which the people may be in the poſſeſſion of. And it is neceſſary alſo that government ſhould raiſe money from the people in ſuch modes, and by ſuch methods as are equitable, eligible, and not oppreſſive.</p>
               <p>This country in moſt of its parts has been accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to raiſe public money by a direct tax on real property, which, when the expences of government were ſmall, and the taxes but trifling, the oppreſſive nature of this mode was ſcarcely felt by any; but ſince the expences of the United States have aroſe to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable magnitude, it has operated with great ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, and in many inſtances, extremely oppreſſive and diſtreſſing.</p>
               <p>That the people ſhould pay in proportion to the real and viſible property which they reſpectively poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, appears to be a fundamental and governing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple in the doctrine of taxation, without conſidering whether it is competent, or more than competent to the original deſign of property, which is the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſubſiſtence and ſupport of the proprietor and his family. Every man is entitled to this benefit from his property, in preference to every other conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If this be juſt, it will follow as a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that to lay a heavy tax on the property of thoſe who derive no other benefit from it than a bare ſubſiſtence, and that perhaps not a comfortable one, is oppreſſive and diſtreſſing on ſuch individuals. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be juſt or unovoidable is a matter of further conſideration.</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of moſt countries, are, with reſpect to property, divided into three claſſes: The rich, the middling, and the poor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:021774_0077_0FB59E7408DE89D0"/>
The rich are enabled to live in eaſe, and add no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the wealth of a nation by their own labour; and in proportion to the value of their property, are able to add an annual ſum to their original ſtock, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſupporting themſelves and families in affluence. The rich however, are not a uſeleſs unimportant claſs of citizens. They are able to eſtabliſh and carry on many kinds of buſineſs of public advantage and utility, which thoſe in middling or low circumſtances could not do. But at the ſame time, the immediate advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages and profits of ſuch kinds of buſineſs go to the emolument of the rich man. The rich alſo are of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the public, as they are enabled to give em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment and ſupport to the poor—thoſe who have nothing to depend on for a livelihood but their labour. But then, the property of the rich derives as great or greater advantage from the labours of the poor, as the poor acquire to themſelves.</p>
               <p>The middling claſs of people, thoſe who have ſome ſmall property, by their induſtry and frugality pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a ſupport for themſelves and families—ſome but a ſcanty—ſome a comfortable ſupport, and ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may add a ſmall ſum to their property annually. This claſs of the people are the moſt numerous, and promote the wealth and ſtrength of a nation, by cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and improving the face of the country, and by po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulating it with a hardy race of induſtrious citizens, while in general, the only benefit they derive from their property and labour, is a bare ſubſiſtence and ſupport.</p>
               <p>The poor, as they are wholly dependent on the rich for employment, ſo the rich have it always in their power to fix the price of the labour of the poor; and if we conſider the condition of the rich, and take the trouble of looking into the houſes of the poor; obſerve their ſubſiſtence, their clothing and general mode of living, we ſhall find convincing evidence, that the profitable parts of the labour of the poor are accumulated by the rich.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="79" facs="unknown:021774_0078_0FB59E7588428080"/>
If this be a juſt repreſentation; if the middling claſs of the people accumulate little or no wealth by their property and labour, and if the profits of the labour of the poor are accumulated in one way, and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other by the rich, then I think it may be rationally concluded, that on the principles of juſtice, the rich are to be applied to by government for money, for the ſervices of the public, to the relief, if not to the exoneration of the other claſſes of the people.</p>
               <p>There are many within the compaſs of my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge who have a ſmall property, which to be taxed in proportion to the property of many rich people, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the common rules of apportionment, would produce a conſiderable ſum, equal in ſome inſtances to what is received from many other people worth ten times as much. This is unavoidable in the common modes of taxation; for no general rule can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed, to apply to the various kinds and different va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of property with equality; and ſome kinds of property in ſome circumſtances cannot be touched. Such modes therefore which operate with inequality, and are productive of diſtreſs on particular claſſes of the people, muſt be conſidered as erroneous in their principles; and ſuch I conceive are the modes of tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation generally eſtabliſhed in the States.</p>
               <p>To more fully explain and illuſtrate my ideas on this point, I will propoſe a caſe which I believe is much more than a ſuppoſeable one.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> has a property in lands and ſtock of the value of five hundred pounds, on which a tax is laid of ten pounds. This property with his own labour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces a comfortable ſupport for himſelf and family, and nothing more, which we will ſuppoſe amounts to one hundred pounds. <hi>B.</hi> has a property of the ſame kind, worth five thouſand pounds, on which a tax is laid in the ſame proportion of one hundred pounds. This property, with an equal proportion of labour, will produce one thouſand pounds, which is nine
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:021774_0079_0FB59E77013FAFD8"/>hundred pounds more than ſufficient to ſupport his family, in the manner <hi>A.</hi> ſupports his. The addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional expence of labour, neceſſary to be performed on the larger eſtate, we will compute at four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds, which leaves a nett profit of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds. From this ſtate of the caſe, which I believe is juſt, it appears that <hi>B.</hi> could pay five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten pounds into the public treaſury, with as little prejudice to his intereſt, as <hi>A.</hi> could ten pounds. But, by the common rules of aſſeſſment, he pays only one hundred pounds, by which <hi>A.</hi> ſinks ten pounds of his property annually, and <hi>B.</hi> adds four hundred pounds to his. This is the general operation of the common modes of taxation, and methods of raiſing money for public ſervices, adopted by moſt or all the States, which on account of their inequality and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive conſequences in their application, ought to be condemned.</p>
               <p>There is an inſtance which occurs that further il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrates this point, and in my mind places it in a ſtriking point of light. This was the ſinkage of the continental money.</p>
               <p>I think it muſt appear evident to every one, that had that money been ſunk by a tax on real property, in the common modes of taxation, the property of ſeven-eights of the people, or at at leaſt a very great proportion, would have fallen into the hands of the other eighth: But by its ſinking as it did, thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who had acquired it by exorbitant profits, without affecting their real property, paid it without being diſtreſſed. Some inſtances it is true there were of injuſtice and oppreſſion taking place, in conſequence of the depreciation and final ſinkage of that money; but theſe were ſo few in compariſon with what would have happened by its being ſunk by a tax on property, that on the whole it muſt be conſidered as the moſt juſt and eligible mode that could have been deviſed to pay that debt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="unknown:021774_0080_0FB59E80D61F6808"/>
Becauſe therefore, no general rule of aſſeſſment can be ſo calculated as to apply with propriety and equali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the property of the people, without producing numberleſs inſtances of oppreſſion and diſtreſs; the neceſſity of reſorting to other methods of raiſing pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic monies, appears obvious; and among other pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ways and means, a tax on articles of importation is evidently one. By this, application is made di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to the pockets of the rich; the amount of the money paid to the public is optional and voluntary; the effect is not ſenſibly felt; and it is alſo the moſt ſummary, eligible and ſure method of collecting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for the ſervices of the nation.</p>
               <p>A tax of this kind, and to be conſidered by go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as its principal reſource would, in my humble opinion, go farther towards the peaceable and firm eſtabliſhment of the new form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than all the reviſions and amendments, which could render the conſtitution more perfectly agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ideas of the opponents; for I know of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more really feared by the moſt numerous part of the people, than heavy taxes on their property, and for this reaſon with others, I conceive the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will conſider an impoſt, with the addition of an exciſe, its principal, if not only reſource, and never attempt a land tax, except in caſes of ſpecial emergency.</p>
               <p>But, as an impoſt on foreign articles imported into the United States, may, and I conceive, ought to be ſo calculated, as to anſwer a variety of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial purpoſes beſides ſupplying the national treaſury, which I at firſt took notice of; I would beg leave to explain and illuſtrate my ideas thereon, by enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating a number of imported articles, annexing thereunto a proportion of duties, upon the principle. I have all along proceeded upon.</p>

               <p>In this enumeration and arrangement, I have not aimed at preciſion, or a great degree of certainty and regularity. What I had principally in view, was to explain my own ideas, reſpecting the purpoſes a duty on articles of importation may be calculated to anſwer, which are 1ſt. To draw money from the rich and opulent for public uſes. 2d. To leſſen the two general uſe of luxurious, unneceſſary and trifling articles of foreign production. And 3d. to encourage and ſupport the manufacturing intereſt of the United States.</p>
               <p>Neither have I aimed at a full and complete enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration, nor am I poſitive with reſpect to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the arrangment, for I do not think my information, relative to the preſent ſtate of the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures, is competent to determine with certainty the rate, or amount of duties which would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be laid on ſeveral articles in order to give the neceſſary ſupport, and at the ſame time, the beſt adapted to the circumſtances of the people. But I conceive, a duty on articles of importation, formed and eſtabliſhed on the principles here held forth, would be productive of eſſential advantages to the intereſt of the nation.</p>
               <p>The adoption of the ideas here ſuggeſted, in form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſyſtem of revenue and commerce, may proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, with ſufficient reaſon be found, on examination to be improper. They may prove to be abſurd; or if not abſolutely abſurd, yet objectionable, on many
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:021774_0083_0FB59E8565371D68"/>accounts, particularly as they may appear to have a tendency to circumſcribe commerce within too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row limits. For my own part, I have no idea of circumſcribing trade (properly directed) with regard to its extent, but of confining it to proper channels, and directing it to proper objects; and if I have miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the moſt ſuitable meaſures to anſwer theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, I have miſſed my intention. But I muſt as yet, continue to think it a miſtaken idea which many entertain, that trade is the foundation of national wealth, and that to extend it to extreme lengths, and carry it on in every poſſible way in which it may be proſecuted, promotes the intereſt of the nation, or finally will promote the intereſt of individuals.</p>
               <p>Agriculture and manufactures, I conſider as the ſources and foundation of national wealth. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce the handmaid, or medium, by which the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus productions of agriculture and manufactures are turned to the beſt account, and rendered in the higheſt degree advantageous and profitable. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce therefore, cannot exceed the bounds which agriculture and manufactures may affix, without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring the general intereſt of the nation, and without prejudicing the intereſt of the merchants.</p>
               <p>The United States, ſince the revolution, have fully experienced the licentiouſneſs of trade, and can witneſs the ruinous and diſtreſſing conſequences of it. They, as a nation, have ſuffered a great diminution of property; and if we conſider the number of bankruptcies, the languiſhing ſtate of trade, and the great complaints of the merchants throughout the States, we ſhall find ſufficient reaſon to conclude, that but very few have made trade as beneficial to themſelves as their hopes flattered them it would.</p>
               <p>Such a regulation of trade therefore as will tend to reſtrain its licentious operations, as will tend to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the mercantile, agricultural and manufacturing intereſts of the United States and render it ſubſervient
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:021774_0084_0FB59E8B9D5AE868"/>on the whole to the general welfare of the nation, muſt neceſſarily promote the particular intereſt of thoſe who are concerned in trade.</p>
               <p>Foreign merchants and ſpeculators may be fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in their views thereby, but I conceive that to be a conſideration not of ſufficient conſequence to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the United States, to ſuperſede conſiderations and meaſures of national utility and advantage.</p>
               <p>Speculators belonging to the ſtates, and thoſe who are inclined to quit a buſineſs in which they have been educated in order to commence merchants and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders may alſo be diſappointed in their wiſhes and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations; but this is not an object of public atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>If my ideas are juſt on this point, an increaſe of merchants and traders in a nation beyond what is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to tranſact its mercantile buſineſs and what can obtain a ſupport by it, is on the one hand of no benefit to the nation, as the ſtock of national wealth receives no augmentation therefrom; and on the other is eſſentially prejudicial to the commercial intereſt.</p>
               <p>Regularity and a good degree of permanency in the mode of buſineſs and the prices of merchandize, together with honorable dealing and punctuality, are eſſential to the ſupport of the intereſt of commerce, to a national reputation and general confidence, and on the whole to the proſperity and advancement of the commerce of a nation; and I know of nothing which tends to deſtroy ſuch a proper order of things in trade and to introduce confuſion, perplexity and embarraſſment into the mercantile intereſt than ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numeraries in the buſineſs; for which reaſon I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that altho' it is not conſiſtent with the principles and ſpirit of a free government, to lay prohibitions on perſons entering into any lawful buſineſs for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of obtaining a livelihood; yet that the commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial regulations ſhould not be ſo calculated as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:021774_0085_0FB59E9099145960"/>more people to enter into trade than is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to perform the buſineſs of merchandize to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the public, and to the benefit of thoſe who are occupied therein.</p>
               <p>Thus, ſir, have I communicated in as brief a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I could, my ideas and ſentiments on the agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, manufactures, and commerce of the United States, as they are connected with a national revenue; together with ſome of thoſe meaſures, which appear to me neceſſary to render them reciprocally beneficial to each other, and mutually ſubſervient to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the nation. In all which I have no pretenſions to infallibility. They are the reſult of my own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the ſubject, and I give them as a contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution to the general ſtock of ſpeculation.</p>

It will ſtop the mouths of gainſayers to the conſtitution, and contribute moſt eſſentially to the peaceable and firm eſtabliſhment of the national government. But if it ſhould be with reaſon objectionable, either in its principles, or effects, it may create a general un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, and give the opponents a great opportunity to diſturb the public peace, by exciting jealouſies, and inſtigating popular clamour.

               <p>With theſe views, and to this end, I have prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on myſelf to communicate my ſentiments and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations; and, if they ſhould be found worthy of notice—if any thing capable of improvement, my moſt flattering hopes will be fully anſwered.

               <head>AN EXCISE.</head>
               <p>I HAVE before obſerved, that to lay a heavy tax on real property, and to make it the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reſource of government, ought, if, poſſible, to be avoided. Many, I am ſenſible, are of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that an impoſt will be inadequate to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of government; yet, I muſt think, that moſt of the money which could be drawn from the people with convenience, might be drawn in this way; but at the ſame time, as one general princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which I have all along aimed at ſupporting, would not have its weight and full effect without an exciſe, I apprehend it ought to be included in the ſyſtem of revenue. The principle I allude to is, that the luxuries, ſuperfluities, &amp;c. made uſe of by the people, ſhould be conſidered and taxed as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per medium of revenue.</p>
               <p>It is an opinion which I have long entertained, that there are vices, follies, extravagancies and vanity
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:021774_0087_0FB59E93DB77CCA0"/>enough in all nations, to ſupport their neceſſary expences, were they properly applied to, without taxing induſtry and other national virtues. And as many of the ſuperfluities, &amp;c. made uſe of by the people, are of the manufacture of the United States, and many other proper objects of taxation, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the limits of an impoſt, a ſyſtem of revenue would be imperfect were theſe not to be taxed by way of exciſe, or be charged with a tax of ſome denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>And I am of opinion alſo, that an exciſe ſhould not be laid on any imported article; becauſe, all the tax which ought to be laid on theſe, might as well be collected at their entry, as to be at further expences in collecting an additional duty.</p>
               <p>I would therefore, ſuggeſt the following particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, as proper objects of taxation by way of exciſe. This country diſtilled rum, brandy, geneva, whiſkey, cordial waters, &amp;c. ſnuff, tobacco, loaf ſugar, gold and ſilver plate, jewellry, playing cards, hair powder, &amp;c. The amount of a tax on theſe, to be in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion with the impoſt on the like claſſes of foreign articles, ſo as to put them on an equal footing.</p>
               <p>And I would ſuggeſt alſo, by way of quere, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a tax on licences granted to attorneys at law, to practice in the national courts, would not be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and conſiſtent with the principles here held forth.</p>
               <p>I would furthermore propoſe livery ſervants, carriages, race-horſes and packs of hounds, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per objects of taxation.</p>
               <p>As the exportation of the manufactures of the United States ſhould be encouraged, ſo ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe may have been paid paid on, and afterwards ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, ſhould be entitled to the benefit of a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; and the ſame benefit alſo, ought to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to articles imported, on which a duty hath been paid, and which may be afterwards exported out of the States.</p>

               <head>THE NAVIGATION OF THE UNITED STATES.</head>
               <p>THE importance of navigation to a nation, is too great to eſcape general notice; and as there is no nation which has the reſources and natural advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to ſupport an extenſive navigation, and at laſt, to obtain the empire of the ſea, that the United States have, I conceive, a foundation ought to be laid as early as poſſible for the ſupport and increaſe of their navigation.</p>
               <p>The reſources of the States, and the enterpriſing ſpirit of their citizens are known by moſt of the maritime powers of Europe. They know the States can build, equip and navigate, and conſequently can freight cheaper than any nation in Europe. And they are ſenſible, that by an encouragement of the navigation of the States, a foundation would be laid for ſuch a maritime force, as to endanger their Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican dominions. It is, I conceive, for theſe reaſons among others, that Great Britain in particular, is taking the moſt decided meaſures in its power, to ſuppreſs the navigation of the States. And it is for this reaſon alſo, that the States, ought to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and take the moſt effectual meaſures in their power, for the ſupport of their navigation, and of their right with other nations to the occupancy of the ſeas.</p>
               <p>No veſſel therefore, ſhould be imployed in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of the United States, but thoſe which are built in them; and navigated by the maſter and greater part of the crew who are citizens, or Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſubjects. And for the prevention of fraud, and uncertainties, with reſpect to the build, owners and crew; the regiſter ſhould particularly ſtate and ſet forth the place where, the time when, and carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by whom the veſſel was built. Her rig, general form and model. Her length from her ſtem to her
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:021774_0089_0FB59E9F0E6EDAD0"/>tranſom, on the main deck. Her extreme width, and her depth at the forepart of her hatchway; alſo her true tonage, according to carpenters meaſurement. The owner, or owners, if more than one the part each may own, and their reſpective places of reſidence; ſhould likewiſe be ſtated and ſet forth in the regiſter. Certificates alſo, I conceive, ſhould accompany every clearance, deſcriptive of the maſter and crew, the place of their nativity and their preſent allegiance.</p>
               <p>In caſe of any alteration in the rig, form and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of the veſſel, or in the owners, the regiſter ſhould be returned and canceled, and a new one taken out.</p>
               <p>Theſe meaſures, I conceive, are neceſſary to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the navigation of the United States, and the increaſe of their ſeamen.</p>

               <head>AMERICAN NAVY.</head>
               <p>THE diſpoſition of the people of the United States, is now pacific. They think of nothing at preſent but cultivating the arts of peace, and apprehend no danger of invaſion; neither do their views extend to the enlargement of territory. But this will, probably, not always be the caſe. The ambition of the people of this country, like that of all other nations, will be excited by, and increaſe with their increaſing power.</p>
               <p>The firſt objects of their ambition lie open be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, are now obvious to every attentive ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver. The natural boundaries of the United States, are the river St. Lawrence on the north, and the Miſſiſſippi on the ſouth, to which, one day or another the dominion of the States will probably be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the Weſt-India iſlands, are the natural ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendages of this continent. Beyond theſe, I think the United States can never have a juſtifiable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ambition,</p>

                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:021774_0090_0FB59EA04AB662C8"/>
The increaſe of the power of the States will, I am of opinion, be more rapid than the people in general are aware of, and of conſequence, bring theſe things into contemplation ſooner, than may be generally imagined. By the great migrations into this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, in conſequence of the eſtabliſhment of a good and ſafe government, together with its natural po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation, the number of inhabitants will, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, in fifty years, amount to about twenty millions. Such an increaſe of the power of the States, together with their natural reſources, will excite the jealouſy, and arouſe the fears of thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions who have poſſeſſions on this ſide the Atlantic. Some of whom may ſecure the friendſhip of the States, others may not, particularly Great Britain, who ſo long as ſhe retains her preſent ideas of omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, will never ſolicit the friendſhip of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States; but inſtead thereof, will make uſe of every method to ſuppreſs their riſing power, and when that is found impracticable, will attempt to form a confederacy againſt them. This, although it be a matter of conjecture, is, I think, founded on ſuch circumſtances, as to render it warrantable, and notwithſtanding events of this nature are reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a future period of time, yet I conceive, they are objects which always ought to be kept in view, and provided for as ſoon, and as faſt as it may be in the power of the States ſo to do. And to this end,</p>
               <p>Beſides the meaſures neceſſary to be taken to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the wealth of the nation, and to keep the militia in a ſtate of good military order and diſcipline, a naval force, I conceive, ſhould be collected, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed as faſt as it can conveniently be done.</p>
               <p>Many I know, are of opinion, that a naval force will never be requiſite; but I muſt differ from ſuch in opinion; conſidering thoſe circumſtances which I have now taken notice of; conſidering that the navigation and commerce of the United States, will
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:021774_0091_0FB59EA1E8210688"/>more and more tend to the rivalry of the commerce of ſeveral of the maritime powers of Europe, and in conſequence thereof, the policy of thoſe nations will be oppoſed to the policy of the United States, and conſidering alſo, that the only ſure dependence the States can have in any event, will be on their own ſtrength and reſources, I cannot but think, they will have a great and neceſſary occaſion for a naval force. If ſo, the eſtabliſhment of a navy ſhould be begun as ſoon as poſſible, for it will require a length of time to render it formidable.</p>
               <p>A naval force muſt neceſſarily be but ſmall at the firſt, but however ſmall it may be, it would anſwer ſeveral good and neceſſary purpoſes. As 1ſt. It would be a means of preventing a ſmuggling buſineſs on the coaſt, which is very practicable to be done, by ſure-concerted meaſures. 2d. It wouldbe a means of preventing acts of piracy, which have frequently been committed on the coaſt, and even in our har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. And 3d. That which I eſteem a matter of the greateſt conſequence is, the teaching the order and diſcipline of a navy. Such a ſchool is wanted, for thoſe young men, who might be diſpoſed to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove themſelves in naval and nautical knowledge; for which reaſon, if a naval force ſhould be collected, let it be ever ſo ſmall, a ſtrict diſcipline ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be maintained, and conſidered a principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject—Should a naval armament at any future time, be neceſſary for the defence of the nation, or other national purpoſes, it would lay the States under great diſadvantages, had they no citizens capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding.</p>
               <p>Ruſſia has become a conſiderable maritime power, yet ſhe has introduced Engliſhmen into her navy as officers; and that to ſuch a degree, that were they to quit her ſervice, her navy would be prejudiced, if not ruined—And ſhould a rupture happen between Ruſſia and Great-Britain, which is by no means im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, what dependence would Ruſſia make on her navy, commanded by Engliſhmen.</p>

                  <hi>The</hi> SECURITY <hi>and</hi> COLLECTION <hi>of the</hi> IMPOST.</head>
               <p>A JUST and punctual payment of the impoſt, is not only of importance to the revenue, but to the intereſt of the fair trader; for which reaſon, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the intereſt and duty of the public and of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals, particularly the merchants, to make uſe of the beſt and moſt effectual meaſures in their power, for the ſecurity and collection of the duties which may be impoſed on articles of importation.</p>
               <p>The coaſt of the United States is ſo extenſive, with ſo many harbours, inlets, &amp;c. that a ſmuggling buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs might eaſily be carried on, and that withoutmuch fear of detection. And even in the ports ſmuggling might eaſily and ſafely be done, unleſs a great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of officers ſhould be added to the cuſtom houſes.</p>
               <p>As the States have patterned after the Britiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in many things, ſo, among others, they have adopted the Britiſh methods of ſecuring the impoſt, which conſiſts in oaths and a multiplicity of cuſtom-houſe officers. But I conceive, a much better mode could be deviſed; for a multiplicity of officers is but a burden on the revenue, and ſo far as my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation extends, I cannot but think a national re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue is in general, more defrauded by the cuſtom-houſe officers, than by ſmugglers.</p>
               <p>The United States would undoubtedly prefer the moſt eligible and effectual, and at the ſame time, the leaſt burthenſome methods of ſecuring and col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the revenue. And among a variety of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods that might he propoſed, I would take the liberty to propoſe one, which, conſidering every circumſtance, appears to me, the moſt eligible. I will not pretend to ſay it is, in fact, worthy of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation; but it may nevertheleſs, be a means of producing ſomething better.</p>
               <p>The mode I would propoſe is this To appoint a collector general, who will keep his office at the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:021774_0093_0FB59EAD0D91FFC0"/>ſeat of government. Appoint a collector in each port, where a cuſtom-houſe may be neceſſary; and weighers, guagers and meaſurers in the ports, where a cuſtom-houſe is eſtabliſhed, in number, according to the buſineſs to be performed in the reſpective ports; the ſame alſo, in ſuch out ports as veſſels may belong to, and diſcharge at. Theſe, I conceive, are all the officers neceſſary to be appointed.</p>
               <p>The duty of the weighers, &amp;c. to aſcertain the contents of ſuch cargoes as require weighing, guaging and meaſuring, and to return certificates thereof (they being under oath, and penal obligations) to the cuſtom-houſe. The duty of the collectors to be, beſides what is uſual and common to the office, the making of weekly, or monthly returns, in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal papers of the entry of each veſſel, to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector General's office. The duty of the Collector General to re-enter in his books every veſſel and cargo originally entered in the reſpective ports, and and to keep a regular account with each cuſtom-houſe. Beſides, it will probably be found neceſſary to inveſt this office with certain powers, and to require certain duties of it, which circumſtances may ſuggeſt and particularize.</p>
               <p>Some material advantages, I apprehend, would be derived from ſuch an inſtitution and arrangement, and render it preferable to the common and uſual methods made uſe of in Great Britain, and in this country. It would render the office, duty and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of ſearchers, tide-waters, &amp;c. unneceſſary: It would give the revenue every ſecurity againſt the mal-practices of cuſtom-houſe officers, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be provided againſt, by a plurality of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the cuſtom-houſes of Great Britain; and, what I conceive would be a matter of weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, is, that government could at all times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive official information of the ſtate of the revenue, without delay, trouble or expence.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:021774_0094_0FB59EAE85002AA8"/>
The maſter of a veſſel to be required to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of his arrival at the cuſtom-houſe, within twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four hours after, if he arrives at a port where a cuſtom-houſe is eſtabliſhed; if at an out port, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in forty-eight hours. He ſhall deliver into the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-houſe a manifeſt of his cargo, which ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a particular account thereof, ſo far as to the kind and quality, as far as he may know, and alſo, of the caſks, bales and others packages, together with their marks and numbers, and their general contents, as far as he may have the knowledge of.</p>
               <p>If the cargo conſiſts of ſuch articles as require weighing, guaging and meaſuring before the quantity can be aſcertained, the manifeſt to be left blank until certificates are returned into the office, and to this end, the collector to iſſue an order to a weighter, &amp;c. directing him to attend to the diſcharge of the veſſel—take account of the contents of the cargo, and make returns.</p>
               <p>If the cargo conſiſts of dry goods, &amp;c. of which the invoices contain a juſt account, the merchant, to whom the goods belong, or are conſigned, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver a copy of the invoice or invoices into the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-houſe under oath; in which copy the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar articles ſhall be arranged under the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination or rates of duty.</p>
               <p>On the maſter's giving in his manifeſt, and before permiſſion be granted for the diſcharge of the veſſel, he ſhall execute a bond, with one ſufficient ſecurity, in a penal ſum ſufficient for the purpoſe; the condition of which to be, that he, the maſter, hath made a full and juſt report of his cargo; that he hath not landed out of his veſſel, or ſuffered to be landed, or put, or ſuffered to be put on board of any veſſel or boat, for the purpoſe of being landed in any part of the United States, any part of his cargo, at any time ſince his departure from his port of clearance, until that time, with intent to defraud the revenue, And this bond
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:021774_0095_0FB59EB0319D2818"/>to remain in force for the term of five years. If no information is made within that time, accompanied with ſubſtantial proof of a falſe entry, &amp;c. the bond then to become void. But, if within that time it ſhall appear, by ſufficient teſtimony, that any part was ſmuggled, the penalty to be forfeited, and the bond proſecuted.</p>
               <p>By the requiſition of ſuch a bond, to remain in force for ſo great a length of time, it appears to me, the duties would be more effectually ſecured, than by any other method; for, I think, no maſter of a veſſel would dare to run the riſque of a ſhort entry, when ſo much time was reſerved for detection; and no man would be willing to join in ſuch a bond, until he was ſure of being ſafe. The propriety of the meaſure I will ſubmit, but I am humbly of opininion, that without ſome methods of this nature, the duties in the United States will never be fully ſecured, being ſituated and circumſtanced as they are.</p>
               <p>I am aware of ſome inconveniencies which may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from this mode, but I know of none wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable. It may be objectionable on account of its litigiouſneſs. This would ariſe principally from the various rates of duties impoſed on a great variety of particular articles; but no method occurs to me in which this inconvenience could be fully remedied, unleſs the idea of encouraging and ſupporting the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing intereſt of the ſtates ſhould be given up, wich I preſume will not be the caſe. However, I conceive that the forms of entry may be ſo ſimplified and methodized, as to remedy moſt of the inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences which may ariſe from this cauſe. It may be found exceptionable on another account. Veſſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to, and diſcharging at an out port, would lay the maſter and his ſecurities under the neceſſity of making two journies to the cuſtom-houſe, before the duties could be ſettled. This is an inconvenience for which I know of no remedy, for I conceive no delay
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:021774_0096_0FB59EB850C6DC60"/>ſhould be made in the ſettlement of the duties. Forty-eight hours after the contents of the cargo is aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is time ſufficient for that purpoſe, if at an out port; and twenty-four hours, if at the port where a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom-houſe is eſtabliſhed. To delay the ſettlement of the duties until it may be convenient for the maſter to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend at the cuſtom-houſe, or, until he ſhould have oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to clear his veſſel out, in order to ſave the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of an extra journey, would be ſo out of rule, and ſo dangerous to the revenue, that ſuch an indulgence could not with any propriety be granted. Another objection may be made. It frequently happens, that veſſels belonging to one port of the States, having car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes on board conſigned to the maſter or ſupercargo, enter in other ports of the States, out of which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goes on extra commiſſion could not, without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, be given as an inducement to a merchant to become a ſecurity in the requiſite bonds. In order therefore to remedy this, and to accommodate the intereſt of the merchants of the United States, in all ſuch caſes, the maſters executing the bonds, might be declared by law to be ſufficient to bind the owner, or owners, let them reſide in whatever part of the States they may. This is one reaſon among others, why, I conceive, that regiſters ſhould be particular and explicit in the ſtatement of the owners of veſſels. On the whole therefore, I cannot ſee any reaſon why the impoſt may not be ſecured and collected, in the moſt effectual manner, and with as few inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, in ſome methods of the nature here ſuggeſted, as in any which can be propoſed.</p>
               <p>To what I have here obſerved, I would beg leave to add a few remarks relative to this ſubject.</p>
               <p>I have had frequent opportunities of obſerving the conduct of revenue officers in a variety of ſituations and circumſtances, and the proceedings of maritime courts in caſes of ſeizure for a breach of the laws of trade; and I have remarked a number of abuſes to
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:021774_0097_0FB59EBB861E3920"/>the revenue and many hardſhips and grievances ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered by people who have unfortunately fell into the hands of the officers of the cuſtoms.</p>
               <p>In moſt or all nations, a proſecution in the caſe of a breach of the laws of trade is confined to the officers of the cuſtoms, by which means they have it in their power to defraud the revenue for the ſake of a bribe; in a manner ſafe to themſelves as well as the perſon indulged. Inſtances of this nature are frequent in many ports. To prevent ſuch practices I conceive a liberal reward ſhould be propoſed to an informer and proſecutor, and that any perſon whatever be authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to proſecute on giving ſufficient bonds as well as a cuſtom houſe officer; beſides, a cuſtom houſe officer ſhould be ſubjected to heavy penalties and high for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feitures in caſes of mal-practice. On the other hand, a perſon who maliciouſly or wantonly informs againſt or proſecutes any perſon for a breach of the laws of trade, ſhould be liable to a ſevere puniſhment beſides making good all damages. An informer ought not to be given up except in this caſe, neither ſhould he be admitted as an evidence.</p>
               <p>In caſes of ſeizure I have obſerved under the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government very unfair and ungenerous methods made uſe of in the preparatory examinations. Thoſe people who are ſuppoſed to be knowing to the fact are ſeparately examined and croſs examined, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied often with threats or promiſes, until ſomething is in this manner drawn out ſufficient to ſerve the end in view; and without admitting the perſon or perſons concerned to be preſent. By this means many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent people have ſuffered extremely.</p>
               <p>No examinations of this nature I conceive ought to be admitted but in the preſence of the parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
               <p>I have known an eſtabliſhed cuſtomary compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the judge of a court of admiralty in all caſes of condemnation. This is ſo barefaced a piece of bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:021774_0098_0FB59EBCC654D598"/>that no government would avow and ſupport it: But in ſeaſons of popular zeal, as was lately the caſe among the Engliſh, for the ſuppreſſion of the naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the United States, it may be winked at. Such abuſes however of the judicial powers, ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be guarded againſt.</p>
               <p>I have known alſo, ruin and diſtreſs brought on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons by a rigorous execution of the laws, who have expoſed themſelves to a proſecution, ignorantly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertently. As the intention and deſign conſtitutes the criminality of actions, ſo the laws in all caſes ought to diſcriminate between intentional and wilful offenders, and thoſe who have been guilty of a breach of law, ignorantly and undeſignedly. The courts of admiralty therefore, I conceive, ſhould be inveſted with a diſeretionary power to mitigate penalties and forfeitures, in ſuch caſes wherein there may be ſufficient reaſon to determine they were incurred through ignorance or inadvertence. There are, I apprehend, but few caſes brought into any court in which it cannot be determined how ſar a delinquent was intentionally criminal.</p>
               <p>I have but one matter of obſervation more, and that is reſpecting the</p>

               <head>TITLES OF THE PRESIDENT AND VICE-PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.</head>
               <p>MANY of the cuſtoms and uſages of this country are copied from the practices of Great-Britain; ſome of which are ſuitable and proper, and ſome are not; among which, the uſage of conferring the title of <hi>Excellency</hi> on the governors of the ſtates, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſince the revolution, for no other reaſon but becauſe that the governors of provinces under the Britiſh government had ſuch a title conferred on them. The propriety or impropriety of this uſage depends on the original intention of it, applying it to preſent circumſtances.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:021774_0099_0FB59AF9035495B8"/>
The title of Excellency is conferred by the Britiſh government, (where it originated) on perſons of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed rank; yet, they are always conſidered as inferior. It is given to perſons at the head of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments, but at the ſame time, ſuch as are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſubordinate to the ſupreme executive authority of the nation. To render the application of the title proper therefore, and conſiſtent with the original idea on which it was founded, it ought not to have been conferred on the firſt and higheſt executive au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the States, before their late union; becauſe the office and rank was ſupreme and unſubordinate. But as the ſtates have united in a general government, and by that have rendered the government of the ſtates in ſome reſpects ſubordinate to the national go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the title of Excellency becomes again pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the governors of the reſpective ſtates; at the ſame time however, it renders it improper for the Preſident and Vice-Preſident of the United States.</p>
               <p>If titles mean and intend any thing, it is undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to diſtinguiſh perſons in the various ranks they hold, either in the civil, military, or eccleſiaſtical departments. To apply a title therefore, founded on the idea of inferiority to the firſt offices of the nation, and higheſt ranks in life, or to confer a title indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minately on ſupreme, and ſubordinate ranks, appears to me to be the confounding of ideas, and making uſe of titles without meaning.</p>
               <p>The preſidency of the United States is as high an office, and of as much dignity and importance as can be conſtituted and eſtabliſhed by any nation on earth; and although I ſhould object in my own mind to the Preſident's being ornamented with unmeaning and oſtentatious titles; yet, ſuch a title, in my humble opinion, ought to be conferred, as would in a rational and decent manner, diſtinguiſh the rank, and be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of the reſpect due from the people to that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, who, by their own ſuffrages, they advance to a ſtation of the higheſt national dignity and honor.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:021774_0100_0FB59AFA8200A648"/>
In primitive times, when titles were made uſe of for no other purpoſes but that of diſtinguiſhing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the various ranks and offices which they filled, the ſimple title of king was given to the head of the nation, which was ſufficient; for to that could be affixed every idea of diſtinction, honor and reſpect, that ought to be connected therewith, as well as by adding a multiplicity of diſtinguiſhing appellations. But ſince then, as people have refined and improved in the arts of pride and vanity, and as the kings of the earth have, at times, maintained an abſolute do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the minds and perſons of their ſubjects, they have aſſumed titles which are repugnant to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, religion and propriety. In fact, many of them approach nigh on the borders of idolatry. They are not properly titles, but attributive appellations, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing certain qualifications and properties, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or admitted to be inherent in kings; the evident deſign and reaſon of which is to gratify a ſpirit of pride and vanity, the firſt and moſt predominating quality of a royal mind; to excite a ſpirit of ſervility and awe in the minds of the people, and to eraſe out of the mind the mortifying idea of humanity.</p>
               <p>The Britiſh nation, as enlightened as it is, has gone as far into this ſpirit of pride and oſtentation, and ſpecies of idolatry, as any nation in Europe, which is called in Great-Britain, the dignity of government. But I cannot but hope and expect the United States will never conſider the dignity of their government to conſiſt in titles, or in an awful diſtance placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the officers of ſtate, and the people at large; but in ſomething more eſſential to real national dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and honor.</p>
               <p>The citizens of the United States, in all their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic proceedings, have exhibited an unprecedented ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, of a people ſpread over an extenſive territory, remote from one another; whoſe intereſts, cuſtoms and manners are different, yet, uniting in national
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:021774_0101_0FB59B0276A7A360"/>meaſures, and without a dictator, or any coercive power, governing themſelves by reaſon and principle; and the ſame good ſenſe which on all occaſions has dictated the moſt proper meaſures, will, I doubt not, ſuggeſt ſome proper titles for the Preſident and Vice-Preſident; ſuch as will be free from European arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance and impiety, and conſiſtent with common ſenſe, republican principles, and the genius of the people; ſuch as will diſtinguiſh ranks and offices of the firſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional dignity and importance, and be expreſſive of that degree of honor and reſpect which is reaſonably and preceptively enjoined on the people.</p>
               <p>I will take the liberty to mention what has ſtruck my mind on this ſubject, but as it is a late and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient thought, I do it with diffidence.</p>
               <p>That which has appeared to me as proper and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with my own ideas, is this: For the Preſident, <hi>The High and Moſt Honorable,</hi> the Preſident, &amp;c. And for the Vice-Preſident, <hi>The High and Honorable,</hi> the Vice-Preſident, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The only objection which at preſent occurs to me, that could be made to ſuch titles, by the moſt rigid commonwealths-men, would be with reſpect to their perſonal application. <hi>Your Highneſs,</hi> and <hi>His Highneſs</hi> might in ſome ears ſound unpleaſant, and too much like royalty. But I apprehend it would be found on examination, to contain nothing but what is quite pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and reaſonable, and perfectly conſiſtent with the Conſtitution, and the ſpirit and principles of a free government. I ſuggeſt it however as a matter of ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation.</p>
