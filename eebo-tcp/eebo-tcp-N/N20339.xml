            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IN making ſelections for the following work, a preference has been given to the productions of American ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius. The Compiler, however, has not been wholly confined to America; but has extracted from approved writers of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ages and countries. Convinced of the impropriety of inſtilling falſe notions into the minds of children, he has not given place to romantic fiction. Although moral eſſays have not been neglected; yet pleaſing and intereſting ſtories, exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plifying moral virtues, were judged beſt calculated to engage the attention and improve the heart. Tales of love have not gained admiſſion.</p>
            <p>The Compiler pledges himſelf, that, while this book contains nothing offenſive to the moſt rigid moraliſt, neither a <hi>word</hi> nor <hi>ſentiment</hi> ſhall be ſound, which would "raiſe a bluſh on the cheek of modeſty."</p>
            <p>In the arrangement of pieces, the uſual order has not been obſerved. But, with deſign to render it more pleaſing to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, dialogues, orations, hiſtorical anecdotes, &amp;c. with the different kinds of reading in proſe and verſe, are variouſly interſperſed through the whole work.</p>
            <p>For the conveniency of large claſſes, the ſeveral pieces are divided into paragraphs of a moderate length; the utility of which, thoſe converſant in the inſtruction of youth will readily diſcover. Inſtructors are aſſured, that the inconveniency ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the frequent alterations in the different editions of ſchool-books will never be experienced in this.</p>
            <p>The Compiler is far from wiſhing to eſtabliſh the merits of this, by making objections to other performances. Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been his object. How far he has ſucceeded, a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did public will decide.</p>

            <head>GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR READING AND SPEAKING. EXTRACTED FROM BLAIR'S LECTURES.</head>
            <p>THE firſt object of a reader or ſpeaker, is, to be clearly underſtood by his hearers. In order for this, it is neceſſary that he ſhould pronounce his words diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and deliberately; that he ſhould carefully avoid the two extremes of uttering either too faſt, or too ſlow; and that his tone of voice ſhould be perfectly natural.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A reader or ſpeaker ſhould endeavor to acquire a perfect command of his voice; ſo as neither to ſtun his hearers by pitching it upon too high a key; nor tire their patience by obliging them to liſten to ſounds which are ſcarcely audible. It is not the loudeſt ſpeaker, who is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the beſt underſtood; but he who pronounces upon that key which fills the ſpace occupied by the audience. That pitch of voice, which is uſed in ordinary converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is uſually the beſt for a public ſpeaker.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Early attention ought to be paid to the pauſes; but the rules for theſe are ſo indefinite and arbitrary, and ſo difficult to be comprehended, that long experience is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in order to acquire a perfect knowledge of their uſe. With regard to the length of the ſeveral pauſes, no preciſe rules can be given. This, together with the variety of tones which accompany them, depends much upon the nature of the ſubject.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Perhaps nothing is of more importance to a reader or ſpeaker, than a proper attention to accent, emphaſis, and cadence. Every word in our language, of more than one ſyllable, has, at leaſt, one accented ſyllable. This ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable ought to be rightly known, and the word ſhould be pronounced by the reader or ſpeaker in the ſame manner as he would pronounce it in ordinary converſation.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:026674_0006_0FD1555501DBFB90"/>5. By emphaſis we diſtinguiſh thoſe words in a ſentence which we eſteem the moſt important, by laying a greater ſtreſs of voice upon them than we do upon the others. And it is ſurpriſing to obſerve how the ſenſe of a phraſe may be altered by varying the emphaſis. The following example will ſerve as an illuſtration.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This ſhort queſtion, "Will you ride to town to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>' may be underſtood in four different ways, and, conſequently, may receive four different anſwers, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the placing of the emphaſis.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If it be pronounced thus; Will <hi>you</hi> ride to town to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day? the anſwer may properly be, no; I ſhall ſend my ſon. If thus; Will you <hi>ride</hi> to town to-day? Anſwer, no; I intend to walk. Will you ride to <hi>town</hi> to-day? No; I ſhall ride into the country. Will you ride to town <hi>to-day?</hi> No; but I ſhall to-morrow.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This ſhows how neceſſary it is that a reader or ſpeaker ſhould know where to place his emphaſis. And the only rule for this is, that he ſtudy to attain a juſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the force and ſpirit of the ſentiments which he delivers. There is as great a difference between one who lays his emphaſis properly, and one who pays no regard to it, or places it wrong, as there is between one who plays on an inſtrument with a maſterly hand, and the moſt bungling performer.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Cadence is the reverſe of emphaſis. It is a depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or lowering of the voice; and commonly falls upon the laſt ſyllable in a ſentence. It is varied, however, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſenſe. When a queſtion is aſked, it ſeldom falls upon the laſt word; and many ſentences require no cadence at all.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In addition to what has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en ſaid, it is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to attend particularly to tones and geſtures. To almoſt every ſentiment we utter, more eſpecially, to every ſtrong emotion, nature has adapted ſome peculiar tone of voice. And we may obſerve, that every man, when he is much in earneſt in common diſcourſe, when he is ſpeaking on ſome ſubject which intereſts him nearly, has an eloquent or perſuaſive tone and manner.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If one were to tell another that he was very angry, or very much grieved, in a tone which did not ſuit ſuch emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026674_0007_0FD155565F289000"/>
inſtead of being believed, he would be laughed at. The beſt direction which can be given, is, to copy the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er tones for expreſſing every ſentiment from thoſe which nature dictates to us in converſation with others.</p>
            <p n="12">12. With reſpect to geſture, the few following hints may be of ſome ſervice. When ſpeaking in public, one ſhould endeavor to preſerve as much dignity as poſſible in the whole attitude of the body. An erect poſture is generally to be choſen; ſtanding firm ſo as to have the fulleſt command of all his motions. Any inclination which is uſed, ſhould be forwards towards the hearers, which is a natural expreſſion of earneſtneſs.</p>
            <p n="13">13. As for the countenance, the chief rule is, that it ſhould correſpond with the nature of the diſcourſe; and when no particular emotion is expreſſed, a ſerious and manly look is always the beſt. The eyes ſhould never be fixed cloſe on any one object, but move eaſily round upon the whole audience.</p>
            <p n="14">14. In the motions made with the hands, conſiſts the chief part of geſture in ſpeaking. The right hand ſhould be uſed more frequently than the left. Warm emotions demand the motion of both hands correſponding together. All the geſtures ſhould be free and eaſy. Perpendicular movements with the hands, that is, in a ſtraight line up and down, are ſeldom good. Oblique motions are, in general, the moſt graceful.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Motions made with the hands ſhould proceed rather from the ſhoulders than from the elbows; for they appear much more eaſy. Too ſudden and nimble motions ſhould be avoided. Earneſtneſs can be fully expreſſed without them. Above all things, a ſpeaker ſhould guard againſt affectation, which is always diſguſtful.</p>
         </div>
         <div type="part">
            <head>SELECT SENTENCES.</head>
            <p>TIME is more valuable to young people than to any others. They ſhould not loſe an hour in forming their taſte, their manners, and their minds; for whatever they are, to a certain degree, at eighteen, they will be more or leſs ſo all the reſt of their lives.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:026674_0008_0FD155580F7E2408"/>2. Nothing can be of greater ſervice to a young man who has any degree of underſtanding, than an intimate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation with one of riper years, who is not only able to adviſe, but who knows the manner of adviſing. By this mean, youth can enjoy the benefit of the experience of age; and that, at a time of life when ſuch experience will be of more ſervice to a man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than when he has lived long enough to acquire it of himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The kindneſſes which moſt men receive from others, are like traces drawn in the ſand. The breath of every paſſion ſweeps them away, and they are remembered no more. But injuries are like inſcriptions on monuments of braſs or pillars of marble, which endure, unimpaired, the revolutions of time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. View the groves in autumn, and obſerve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſucceſſion of falling leaves; in like manner the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of men ſilently drop from the ſtage of life, and are blended with the duſt from whence they ſprang.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Perfect happineſs is not the growth of a terreſtrial ſoil; it buds in the gardens of the virtuous on earth, but blooms with unfading verdure only in the celeſtial regions.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He who would paſs the latter part of his life with honor and decency muſt, when he is young, conſider that he ſhall one day be old; and remember, when he is old, that he has once been young.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He who governs his paſſions does more than he who commands armies. Socrates, being one day offended with his ſervant, ſaid, "I would beat you, if I were not angry."</p>
            <p n="8">8. We too often judge of men by the ſplendor, and not by the merit of their actions. Alexander demanded of a pirate whom he had taken, by what right he infeſted the ſeas? By the ſame right, replied he boldly, that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the world. I am called a robber, becauſe I have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one ſmall veſſel; but you are ſtyled a conqueror, becauſe you command great fleets and armies.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Beauty, as the flowery bloſſom, ſoon fades; but the divine excellencies of the mind, like the medicinal virtues of the plant, remain in it when all thoſe charms are withered.</p>
            <p n="10">10. There are two conſiderations which always em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter the heart of an avaricious man; the one is a perpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual thirſt after more riches; the other, the proſpect of leaving what he hath already acquired.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:026674_0009_0FD15559817EA120"/>11. There cannot be a more glorious object in creation, than a human being replete with benevolence, meditating in what manner he may render himſelf moſt acceptable to his Creator, by doing moſt good to his creatures.</p>
            <p n="12">12. A man ſhould never be aſhamed to own he has been in the wrong; which is but ſaying, in other words, that he is wiſer to-day than he was yeſterday.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Knowledge will not be acquired without pains and application. It is troubleſome digging for deep, pure wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but when once you come to the ſpring, they riſe up and meet you.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The moſt unhappy effect of faſhionable politeneſs is, that it teaches us the art of diſpenſing with virtues which it imitates. Let us be educated to cheriſh the principles of benevolence and humanity, and we ſhall have politeneſs enough, or ſhall ſtand in no need of it.</p>
            <p n="15">15. If we ſhould not have that which is accompanied by the graces, we ſhould have that which beſpeaks the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt man, and the good citizen. We ſhould ſtand in no need of having recourſe to the falſehood of appearances.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Man is the only being endowed with the power of laughter, and perhaps he is the only one who deſerves to be laughed at.</p>
            <p n="17">17. It is the great privilege of poverty to be happy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>envied, to be healthful without phyſic, and ſecure without a guard: to obtain from the bounty of nature what the great and wealthy are compelled to procure by the help of artiſts, and the attendance of flatterers and ſpies.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Prudence is a duty which we owe ourſelves, and if we will be ſo much our own enemies as to neglect it, we are not to wonder if the world is deficient in diſcharging their duty to us; for when a man lays the foundation of his own ruin, others too often are apt to build upon it.</p>
            <p n="19">19. There are no principles but thoſe of religion to be depended on in caſes of real diſtreſs; and theſe are able to encounter the worſt emergencies, and to bear us up under all the changes and chances to which our lives are ſubject.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Riches without charity are worth nothing. They are a bleſſing only to him who makes them a bleſſing to others.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The tongue of a viper is leſs hurtful than that of a ſlanderer; and the gilded ſcales of a rattleſnake leſs dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful than the purſe of the oppreſior.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:026674_0010_0FD1555B5DCC6EE8"/>22. As benevolence is the moſt ſociable of all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, ſo it is of the largeſt extent; for there is not any man either ſo great or ſo little, but he is yet capable of giving and of receiving benefits.</p>
            <p n="23">23. When thou doſt good, do it becauſe it is good; not becauſe men eſteem it ſo. When thou avoideſt evil, flee from it becauſe it is evil; not becauſe men ſpeak againſt it. Be honeſt for the love of honeſty, and thou ſhalt be uniformly ſo. He, who doth it without principle, is wavering.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Wiſh rather to be reproved by the wiſe, than to be applauded by him who hath no underſtanding. When they tell thee of a fault, they ſuppoſe thou canſt improve; the other, when he praiſeth thee, thinketh thee like unto himſelf.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Set not thy judgment above that of all the earth; neither condemn, as falſehood, what agreeth not with thine own apprehenſion. Who gave thee the power of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining for others? or who took from the world the right of choice?</p>
            <p n="26">26. How many things have been rejected, which now are received as truth; how many, now received as truths, will in their turn be deſpiſed? Of what then can man be certain?</p>
            <p n="27">27. An immoderate deſire of riches is a poiſon lodged in the ſoul. It contaminates and deſtroys every thing which was good in it. It is no ſooner rooted there, than all virtue, all honeſty, all natural affection, fly before the face of it.</p>
            <p n="28">28. Drunkenneſs is but voluntary madneſs; it embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens men to do all ſorts of miſchiefs; it both irritates wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs and diſcovers it; it does not merely make men vicious, but it ſhows them to be ſo.</p>
            <p n="29">29. Every man ſhould mind his own buſineſs; for he who torments himſelf with other people's good or ill for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, will never be at reſt.</p>
            <p n="30">30. To ſet about acquiring the habit of meditation and ſtudy late in life, is like getting into a go-cart with a grey beard, and learning to walk when we have loſt the uſe of our legs. In general, the foundation of a happy old age muſt be laid in youth; and he, who has not cultivated his reaſon young, will be utterly unable to improve it when old.</p>
            <p n="31">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:026674_0011_0FD1555B63A1C3E0"/>31. Endeavor to be firſt in your profeſſion, and let no one go before you in doing well. Nevertheleſs, do not envy the merits of another; but improve your own talents.</p>
            <p n="32">32. Never reveal your ſecrets to any, except it be as much their intereſt to keep them, as it is yours they ſhould be kept. Entruſt only thyſelf, and thou canſt not be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.</p>
            <p n="33">33. Glory, like a ſhadow, flieth him who purſueth it; but it followeth at the heels of him who would fly from it. If thou court it without merit, thou ſhalt never attain unto it; if thou deſerve it, though thou hide thyſelf, it will never forſake thee.</p>
            <p n="34">34. Purſue that which is honorable, do that which is right; and the applauſe of thine own conſcience will be more joy to thee, than the ſhouts of millions who know not that thou deſerveſt them.</p>
            <p n="35">35. Love labor. If you do not want it for food, you may for phyſic. The idle man is more perplexed to know what to do, than the induſtrious, in doing what he ought. There are few who know how to be idle, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent. By doing nothing, we learn to do ill.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Honor thy father with thy whole heart, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not the ſorrows of thy mother. How canſt thou rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ompenſe them the things which they have done for thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p n="37">37. It is a mark of a depraved mind, to ſneer at de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepid old age, or to ridicule any one who is deformed in his perſon, or lacketh underſtanding. Who maketh one to differ from another?</p>
            <p n="38">38. The merciful man is merciful to his beaſt; and he, who takes pleaſure in tormenting any of God's creatures, although ever ſo inferior, ought to be baniſhed from human ſociety, and ranked among the brutes.</p>
            <p n="39">39. Admoniſh thy friend; it may be he hath not done it; and if he hath, that he do it no more. Admoniſh thy friend; it may be he hath not ſaid it; or if he hath, that he ſpeak it not again. Admoniſh a friend; for many times it is a ſlander; and believe not every tale.</p>
            <p n="40">40. Be not forward in leading the converſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion. This belongs to the oldeſt perſons in company. Diſplay your learning only on particular occaſions. Never oppoſe the opinion of another, but with great modeſty.</p>
            <p n="41">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:026674_0012_0FD1555CEA9E1C48"/>41. On all occaſions, avoid ſpeaking of yourſelf, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Nothing that we can ſay ourſelves will varniſh our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, or add luſtre to our virtues; on the contrary, it will often make the former more viſible, and the latter obſcure.</p>
            <p n="42">42. Without a friend, the world is but a wilderneſs. A man may have a thouſand intimate acquaintances, and not a friend among them all. If you have one friend, think yourſelf happy.</p>
            <p n="43">43. There is but one way of fortifying the ſoul againſt all gloomy preſages and terrors of the mind; and that is, by ſecuring to ourſelves the friendſhip and protection of that Being who diſpoſes of events, and governs futurity.</p>

            <head>A HINT TO PARENTS.</head>
            <p>IT is to be wiſhed that parents would conſider what a variety of circumſtances tend to render the evil reports of their children, reſpecting their teachers, falſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggerated.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They judge haſtily, partially, imperfectly, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly, from the natural defects and weakneſs of their age. They, likewiſe, too often <hi>intentionally</hi> miſrepreſent things. They hate thoſe who reſtrain them; they feel reſentment for correction; they love change; they love idleneſs, and the indulgencies of their home.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Like all human creatures, they are apt not to know when they are well, and to complain. Let parents then conſider theſe things impartially, and be cautious of aſperſing the character, and diſturbing the happineſs of thoſe who may probably deſerve thanks rather than ill uſage; whoſe office is at beſt full of care and anxiety; and, when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by the injudicious interference or complaints of the parents, becomes intolerably burdenſome.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If a father ſuſpect his confidence to have been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, it is beſt to withdraw it immediately, without alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and without reproaches. It would alſo be an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent method of conſulting their own peace, and the welfare of their other ſcholars, if maſters made a rule to exclude from their ſchools the children of thoſe parents who are unjuſtly diſcontented.</p>
            <p n="5">

            <head>THE HISTORY OF JOSEPH ABRIDGED.</head>
            <p>ISRAEL loved Joſeph more than all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, becauſe he was the ſon of his old age; and he gave him a coat of many colours. But when his brethren ſaw their father's partiality to him, they hated him, and would not ſpeak peaceably unto him. And Joſeph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brethren.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Behold, he ſaid, we were binding ſheaves in the field; and lo! my ſheaf aroſe and ſtood upright; and your ſheaves ſtood round about, and made obeiſance to my ſheaf. And his brethren ſaid unto him, Shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? and they hated him the more for his dreams, and for his words.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It happened that his brethren went to feed their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's flock at Dothan. And Joſeph went after his breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren; but, when they ſaw him afar off, they conſpired againſt him to ſlay him; and they ſaid one to another, We will tell our father that ſome evil beaſt hath devoured him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But Reuben wiſhed to deliver him out of their hands: and he ſaid, Let us not kill him, but caſt him into this pit, that is in the wilderneſs. And they followed his counſel, and caſt him into the pit, which then contained no water.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A company of Iſhmaelites from Gilead paſſed by, at this time, with their camels, bearing ſpicery, balm, and myrrh, which they were carrying into Egypt. And Judah ſaid unto his brethren, Let us ſell Joſeph to the Iſhmaelites, and let not our hands be upon him, for he is our brother and our fleſh. And Joſeph was ſold for twenty pieces of ſilver.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And his brethren killed a kid, and dipped his coat in the blood thereof. And they brought it unto their father,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026674_0015_0FD155616F974DC8"/>
and ſaid, This have we found. And Jacob knew it; and believing that Joſeph was devoured by an evil beaſt, he rent his clothes, and put ſackcloth on his loins, and refuſed all comfort, ſaying, I will go down into the grave to my ſon, mourning.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thus wept his father for him. But Joſeph was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into Egypt, and ſold to Potiphar, the captain of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh's guard. And the Lord was with him, and proſpered him; and he found favor in the ſight of his maſter. But by the wickedneſs of Potiphar's wife, he was caſt into the priſon, where the king's priſoners were bound.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Here alſo the Lord continued to ſhow him mercy, and gave him favor in the ſight of the keeper of the priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And all the priſoners were committed to his care; amongſt whom were two of Pharaoh's officers, the chief of the butlers, and the chief of the bakers.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And Joſeph interpreted the dreams of the king's ſer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vants; and his interpretation being true, the chief butler recommended him to Pharaoh, who had dreamed a dream, which Joſeph thus ſhowed unto him. Behold there ſhall come ſeven years of great plenty, throughout all the land of Egypt. And there ſhall ariſe after them ſeven years of famine; and all the plenty ſhall be forgotten in the land of Egypt, and the famine ſhall conſume the land.</p>
            <p n="10">10. And the king ſaid unto Joſeph, Foraſmuch as God hath ſhown you all this, thou ſhalt be over mine houſe; and according to thy word ſhall all my people be ruled. And Joſeph gathered up all the food of the ſeven years, and laid up the food in ſtore houſes. Then the ſeven years of dearth began to come, as Joſeph had foretold.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But in all the land of Egypt there was bread; and people from all countries came unto Joſeph to buy corn, becauſe the famine was ſore in all the lands. Now, amongſt thoſe who came, were the ten ſons of Jacob, from the land of Canaan.</p>
            <p n="12">12. And Joſeph ſaw his brethren, and he knew them, but made himſelf ſtrange unto them, and ſpake roughly to them, ſaying, Ye are ſpies. And they ſaid, Thy ſervants are twelve brethren, the ſons of one man in the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan; and behold the youngeſt is this day with our father, and one is not.</p>
            <p n="13">
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:026674_0016_0FD155636CFDF990"/>13. But Joſeph ſaid unto them, Ye ſhall not go forth hence, except your youngeſt brother come hither. Let one of your brethren be bound in priſon, and go ye to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry corn for the famine of your houſes, and bring your young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt brother unto me.</p>
            <p n="14">14. And their conſciences reproached them; and they ſaid one to another, We are verily guilty concerning our brother, in that we ſaw the anguiſh of his ſoul, when he beſought us, and we would not hear. Therefore is this diſtreſs come upon us.</p>
            <p n="15">15. And they knew not that Joſeph underſtood them, for he ſpake unto them by an interpreter. And he turned himſelf about from them, and wept; and returned to them again, and commoned with them; and took from them Simeon, and bound him before their eyes. And they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto Jacob, their father, in the land of Canaan, and told him all that had befallen them.</p>
            <p n="16">16. And Jacob, their father, ſaid unto them, Me ye have bereaved of my children. Joſeph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will take Benjamin away alſo. But my ſon ſhall not go down with you; for his brother is dead, and he is left alone. If miſchief befal him in the way in which ye go, then ſhall ye bring down my grey hairs with ſorrow to the grave.</p>
            <p n="17">17. But the famine continued ſore in the land; and when they had eaten up the corn, which they had brought out of Egypt, Jacob ſaid unto them, Go again and buy us food. And if it muſt be ſo, now take alſo your brother Benjamin, and ariſe, and go unto the man. And they brought preſents unto Joſeph, and bowed themſelves to him to the earth.</p>
            <p n="18">18. And he aſked them of their welfare; and ſaid, Is your father well? Is he alive? And he lifted up his eyes and ſaw Benjamin his brother; and he was moved with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion; and he ſought where to weep, and he entered his chamber and wept there. And he waſhed his face, and went out, and refrained himſelf.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Then he commanded the ſteward of his houſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Fill the men's ſacks with food, as much as they can car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and put my cup, the ſilver cup, into the ſack of Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min the youngeſt. And the ſteward did according to the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026674_0017_0FD15564E88E9950"/>
word that Joſeph had ſpoken. As ſoon as the morning was light, the men were ſent away, they and their aſſes.</p>
            <p n="20">20. But Joſeph commanded his ſteward to follow them, and to ſearch their ſacks, and to bring them back. And when Judah and his brethren were returned into the city, Joſeph ſaid unto them, What deed is this ye have done? the man, in whoſe hands the cup is found, ſhall be my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and as for you, get you in peace unto your father.</p>
            <p n="21">21. But they ſaid, Our father will ſurely die, if he ſeeth that the lad is not with us; and we ſhall bring down the grey hairs of thy ſervant, our father, with ſorrow to the grave. Then Joſeph could not refrain himſelf before all them that ſtood by him; and he cried, Cauſe every man to go out from me; and there ſtood no man with him, whilſt Joſeph made himſelf known unto his brethren.</p>
            <p n="22">22. And he wept aloud, and ſaid unto his brethren, I am Joſeph; doth my father yet live? and his brethren could not anſwer him, for they were troubled at his preſence. And Joſeph ſaid to his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you; and they came near. And he ſaid, I am Joſeph your brother, whom ye ſold into Egypt.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that ye ſold me hither; for God did ſend me before you, to ſave your lives by a great deliverance. Haſte you, and go up to my father; and ſay unto him, thus ſaith thy ſon Joſeph, God hath made me lord over all Egypt. Come down unto me; tarry not.</p>
            <p n="24">24 And thou ſhalt dwell in the land of Goſhen; and thou ſhalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou haſt. And there will I nouriſh thee; for yet there are five years of famine; leſt thou and thy houſehold, and all that thou haſt come to poverty.</p>
            <p n="25">25. And behold your eyes ſee, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth which ſpeaketh unto you. And you ſhall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and all which you have ſeen; and ye ſhall haſte, and bring down my father hither.</p>
            <p n="26">26. And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck. Moreover, he kiſſed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and after that,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026674_0018_0FD15566FAD34BB0"/>
his brethren talked with him. And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's houſe; and it pleaſed Pharaoh well, and his ſervants.</p>
            <p n="27">27. And Pharaoh ſaid unto Joſeph, Invite hither thy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and his houſehold; and I will give them the good of the land of Egypt; and they ſhall eat the fat of the land.</p>
            <p n="28">28. And the ſpirit of Jacob was revived when he heard theſe tidings; and he ſaid, My ſon is yet alive; I will go and ſee him before I die. And he took his journey, with all that he had. And Joſeph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Iſrael, his father, to Goſhen; and preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf before him, he fell on his neck, and wept for ſome time.</p>
            <p n="29">29. And Joſeph placed his father, and his brethren, and gave them poſſeſſions in the land of Egypt, in the beſt of the land, as Pharaoh had commanded.</p>
            <p n="30">30. This intereſting ſtory contains a variety of affecting incidents; is related with the moſt beautiful ſimplicity; and furniſhes many important leſſons for inſtruction.</p>

            <head>A SHORT SYSTEM OF VIRTUE AND HAP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PINESS.</head>
            <p>I WILL ſuppoſe a virtuous young man form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his mind the principles of his future conduct, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the reſult of his reflections in the following ſoliloquy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. At the age when I am approaching to maturity of reaſon, I perceive myſelf placed in a world abounding with external objects; and I alſo perceive within me powers and paſſions formed to be powerfully excited and affected by them. I am naturally tempted to interrogate myſelf, What am I? whence came I? and whither am I going?</p>
            <p n="3">3. With a view to ſatisfy my own inquiries, I conſider others who appear to be juſt like myſelf; I liſten to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026674_0019_0FD15569C1257CD0"/>
of thoſe who have obtained a reputation for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: and I examine, with ſerious attention, the volumes in which are written the words of the wiſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The reſult of the whole inquiry is a ſincere conviction, that I am placed here to perform many duties; that I origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate from a ſupreme Creator; and that I am going on in the journey of life, to accompliſh ſome of his gracious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes at the cloſe of it, as well as in its progreſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I divide my duty into three parts, according to the ſuggeſtions of my own reaſon, and the inſtruction of books. They conſiſt of the obligations which I owe to myſelf, to others, and to Him, in whoſe hands are both they and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the great Lord of the univerſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. With reſpect to myſelf, as I conſiſt of two parts, a body and a mind, my duty to myſelf again ſeparates itſelf into two correſpondent ſubdiviſions. My body is a machine curiouſly organized, and eaſily deranged by exceſs and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When diſturbed in its economy, it ſubjects me to pain, and diſables me from all neceſſary and pleaſant exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I owe it therefore to myſelf, to taſte the cup, and partake the banquet, and gratify all my ſenſes, no further than thoſe limits which are obviouſly preſcribed by reaſon and experience.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I further learn from the religion of my country, that my body is the temple of the holy Spirit. To pollute it with preſumptuous tranſgreſſion cannot but be blaſphemy; to devote myſelf to gluttony, drunkenneſs, and debauchery, is at once to deaden the growing energies of ſpiritual life, and to weaken and deſtroy the ſubordinate, yet neceſſary parts of me, my animal and material fabric; it is to ſhorten life, and to diſable me from performing its duties while it continues.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But I have alſo a mind capable of riſing to high im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements by culture, and of ſinking to a brutal ſtupidity by neglect. I will make uſe of all the advantages of education. I will devote my hours of leiſure to reading and reflection.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Elegant letters, as well as uſeful ſciences, ſhall claim my attention; for all which tends to poliſh the mind, tends alſo to ſweeten the temper, and to mitigate the remains of natural ferocity.</p>
            <p n="11">
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:026674_0020_0FD1556BB0037930"/>11. My mind, as well as my body, is greatly concerned in avoiding intemperance. Eating to exceſs clouds its brightneſs, blunts its edge, and drags it down to all the groſſneſs of materiality. Intemperate drinking not only reduces it, at the time of its immediate influence, to a ſtar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of brutality, but gradually deſtroys all its vigor.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The ſenſual indulgencies in general, when they are inordinate and exceſſive, debaſe, corrupt, and brutalize. Their delights are tranſient, their pains ſevere and of long duration.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Inſtead then of running into the danger of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, during the ardor of youth, I will fly from the conflict, in which my own paſſions are ſure to fight againſt me, and will probably betray me to the enemy.</p>
            <p n="14">14. I ſee, indeed, thouſands purſuing pleaſure, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to have found it in perfection in the haunts of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery. But I ſee them but for a little while. Like the ſilly inſect which flutters with delight around the taper, they ſoon receive ſome fatal injury in their minds, their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or their fortunes, and drop into irrecoverable ruin.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Alas! I am too much inclined to vice, from the depravity of my nature, and the violence of my paſſions. I will not add fuel to the fire, nor increaſe the violence of that natural tempeſt within me, which of itſelf is ſufficient to accompliſh my deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="16">16. But, at the ſame time, I will not be a cynic. The world abounds with innocent enjoyments. The kind God of nature intended that I ſhould taſte them. But modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is eſſential to true pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="17">17. My own experience, and the experience of mankind from their origin, has declared, that whenever pleaſure ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nds of moderation, it is not only highly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, but diſguſtful. In order to enjoy pleaſure, I ſee the neceſſity of purſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ng ſome buſineſs with attention.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The viciſſitude is neceſſary to excite an appetite and give a reliſh. Nay, the very performance of buſineſs with ſkill and ſucceſs, is attended with a delightful ſatisfaction, which few of the moſt boaſted pleaſures are able to confer.</p>
            <p n="19">19. While I take care of myſelf, of my health, of my improvement in morals and underſtanding, I will not harbor pride, or look down with ſuperciliouſneſs or ill nature on
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026674_0021_0FD1556C991FEE38"/>
thoſe who live, as it were, at random, and who acknowledge no other guide of their conduct, but the ſudden impulſe of a temporary inclination.</p>
            <p n="20">20. With all my improvements and endeavors, I ſhall ſtill feel imperfections enough to humble me. Candor and humility are ſome of the leaſt fallible marks of ſound ſenſe and ſincere virtue. I ſhall have ſufficient employment in correcting myſelf; nor ſhall I preſume to cenſure others, unleſs my profeſſion or relative ſituation render it my duty.</p>
            <p n="21">21. My duty to myſelf is, indeed, intimately connected with my duty to oth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s. By preſerving the faculties of my mind and body, and by improving them to the utmoſt, I am enabled to exert them with effect in the ſervice of ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. I am connected with others by the ties of conſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinity and friendſhip, and by the common bond of parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the ſame humanity.</p>
            <p n="22">22. As a ſon, I ſhall be tender and dutiful; as a brother, uniformly affectionate; as a huſband, faithful and friendly; as a father, kind and provident; as a man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent to men in whatever circumſtances, and however ſeparated from me by country, religion, or government.</p>
            <p n="23">23. But univerſal benevolence muſt not be an inactive principle. If it proceed not to real beneficence, I fear it will have more in it of oſtentation than of ſincerity. I will then prove its ſincerity by doing good, and removing evil of every kind, as far as my abilities allow me, and my influence extends.</p>
            <p n="24">24. But before I pretend to generoſity, I will be ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt. Truth ſhall regulate my words, and equity my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. If I am engaged in a profeſſion, I will do the duties of it; if in merchandize, I will take no advantage of the ignorant, nor debaſe my character, nor wound my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, for the ſake of gain.</p>
            <p n="25">25. In all my intercourſe with ſociety, I will recollect that heavenly precept of doing to others as I wiſh they ſhould do to me; and will endeavor to obey it. I may, I certainly ſhall offend from the violence of my paſſions, the weakneſs of my judgment, the perverſeneſs of my will, and from miſtake and miſapprehenſion.</p>
            <p n="26">26. But while I keep the evangelical rule in view, and ſincerely labor to conform to it, I ſhall ſeldom commit ſuch
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026674_0022_0FD1556E4070D6B8"/>
offences againſt others, as will be either permanently or deeply injurious.</p>
            <p n="27">27. With reſpect to my duty to my Creator, I derive an argument in favor of religion, from the feelings of my own boſom, ſuperior to the moſt elaborate ſubtilties of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ingenuity. In the hour of diſtreſs, my heart as natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally flies for ſuccor to the Deity, as when hungry and thirſty, I ſeek food and water; or when weary, repoſe.</p>
            <p n="28">28. In religion I look for comfort, and in religion I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways find it. Devotion ſupplies me with a pure and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted pleaſure. It elevates my ſoul, and teaches me to look down with proper contempt upon many objects which are eagerly ſought, but which end in miſery.</p>

            <p n="30">30. I find it to have been the religion of Chriſt. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine it with reverence. I encounter many difficulties; but, at the ſame time, I feel within me an internal evidence, which, uniting its force with the external, forbids me to diſbelieve.</p>
            <p n="31">31.

            <p n="32">32. I will learn humility of the humble Jeſus, and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully accept the beneficial doctrines and glorious offers, which his benign religion reaches out to all who ſincerely ſeek him by prayer and penitence.</p>

            <p n="34">34. Human life abounds with evil. I will ſeek balſams for the wounds of the heart in the ſweets of innocence, and in the conſolations of religion. Virtue, I am convinced, is the nobleſt ornament of humanity, and the ſource of the

ſublimeſt, and the ſweeteſt pleaſure; and piety leads to that peace, which the world, and all it poſſeſſes, cannot beſtow.</p>
            <p n="35">35.

            <p n="36">36. But I repreſs my triumphs. After all my improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and all my pantings for perfection, I ſhall ſtill be greatly defective. Therefore, to whatever degree of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence I advance, let me never forget to ſhow to others that indulgence, which my infirmities, my errors, and my voluntary miſconduct, will require both from them, and from mine and their Almighty and moſt merciful Father.</p>

The Jews had a proverb, "That whoever was not bred to a trade, was bred for the gallows." Every muſſulman is commanded by the Koran to learn ſome handicraft or other; and to this precept, even the family of the grand Signior ſo far conform, as to learn as much about the mechaniſm of a watch, as to be able to take it in pieces, and to put it together again.</p>

            <head>CHARACTER OF FIDELIA.</head>
            <p>BEFORE I enter upon the particular parts of Fidelia's character, it is neceſſary to preface, that ſhe is the only child of a decrepid father, whoſe life is bound up in hers. This gentleman has uſed Fidelia from her infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with all the tenderneſs imaginable; and has viewed her growing perfections with the partiality of a parent, who ſoon thought her accompliſhed above the children of all other men; but never thought ſhe was come to the higheſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of which ſhe herſelf was capable.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:026674_0026_0FD155770E8B4058"/>2. This fondneſs has had very pleaſing effects upon his own happineſs; for ſhe reads, ſhe dances, ſhe ſings, uſes her ſpinet and guitar to the utmoſt perfection. And the young lady's uſe of all theſe excellencies, is to divert the old man in his eaſy chair, when he is out of the pangs of a chronical diſtemper.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Fidelia is now in the twenty-third year of her age; but the application of many admirers, her quick ſenſe of all that is truly elegant and noble in the enjoyment of a plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fortune, are not able to draw her from the ſide of her good old father. Certain it is, that there is no kind of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſo pure and angelic, as that of a father to a daughter.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fidelia on her part, as I was going to ſay, as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed as ſhe is, with all her beauty, wit, air and mien, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys her whole time in care and attendance upon her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How have I been charmed to ſee one of the moſt beauteous women the age has produced, kneeling to help on an old man's ſlipper! Her filial regard to him is what ſhe makes her diverſion, her buſineſs, and her glory.</p>
            <p n="5">5. When ſhe was aſked by a friend of her deceaſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to admit of the courtſhip of her ſon, ſhe anſwered, that ſhe had a great reſpect and gratitude to her for the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in behalf of one ſo near to her, but that during her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's life, ſhe would admit into her heart no value for any thing which ſhould interfere with her endeavors to make his remains of life as happy and eaſy as could be expected in his circumſtances.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The happy father has her declaration, that ſhe will not marry during his life, and the pleaſure of ſeeing that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution not uneaſy to her. Were one to paint filial affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in its utmoſt beauty, he could not have a more lively idea of it than in beholding Fidelia ſerving her father at his hours of riſing, meals, and reſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When the general croud of female youth are conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their glaſſes, preparing for balls, aſſemblies, or plays; for a young lady, who could be rega<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:026674_0027_0FD155781BFAE338"/>8. Fidelia performs the duty of a nurſe with all the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of a bride; nor does ſhe neglect her perſon, becauſe of her attendance upon him, when he is too ill to receive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, to whom ſhe may make an appearance.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Fidelia, who gives him up her youth, does not think it any great ſacrifice to add to it the ſpoiling of her dreſs. Her care and exactneſs in her habit convince her father of the alacrity of her mind; and ſhe has of all women the beſt foundation for affecting the praiſe of a ſeeming negligence.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Thoſe who think themſelves the pattern of good breeding, and refinement, would be aſtoniſhed to hear, that, in thoſe intervals, when the old gentleman is at eaſe, and can bear company, there are at his houſe in the moſt regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar order, aſſemblies of people of the higheſt merit; where there is converſation without mention of the abſent, and the higheſt ſubjects of morality treated of as natural and accidental diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="11">11. All of which is owing to the genius of Fidelia, who at once makes her father's way to another world eaſy, and herſelf capable of being an honor to his name in <hi>this.</hi>

            <head>HISTORY OF JERUSALEM.</head>
            <p>ACCORDING to Manetho, an Egyptian hiſtorian, Jeruſalem was founded by the ſhepherds who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded Egypt in an unknown period of antiquity. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Joſephus, it was the capital of Melchizedeck's king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and built in honor of that prince, by twelve neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We know nothing of it with certainty, however, till the time of king David, who took it from the Jebuſites, and made it the capital of his kingdom. It was firſt taken in the days of Jehoaſh, by Hazael, king of Aſſyria, who ſlew all the nobility, but did not deſtroy their city.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It was afterwards taken by Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, who deſtroyed it, and carried away the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants. Seventy years after, permiſſion was granted by Cyrus king of Perſia to the Jews to rebuild their city, which was done; and it continued the capital of Judea till the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026674_0028_0FD1557A0DE2E6B0"/>
time of Veſpaſian, emperor of Rome, by whoſe ſon Titus it was totally deſtroyed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was, however, rebuilt by Adrian, and ſeemed likely to recover its former grandeur; but it flouriſhed for a ſhort time only. When the empreſs Helena, mother of Conſtantine the great, came to viſit it, ſhe found it in a moſt forlorn and ruinous ſituation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Having formed a deſign of reſtoring it to its ancient <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="6">6. In doing this, they found the croſs on which he died, as well as thoſe of the two malefactors who ſuffered with him. She then cauſed a magnificent church to be built, which encloſed as many ſcenes of our Saviour's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings as could conveniently be done.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This church, which ſtands on mount Calvary, is ſtill in good repair, being ſupported by the donations of pilgrims who are conſtantly reſorting to it. Here is to be ſeen our Saviour's ſepulchre, hewn out of a ſolid rock; and the very hole in the rock in which it is ſaid the foot of the croſs was fixed, with many other curioſities.</p>
            <p n="8">8. On mount Moriah ſtood the celebrated temple of Solomon, which was ſeven years in building, and employed no leſs than 163,300 men. The height of this building on one ſide was at leaſt 960 feet; and the ſtones employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about the ramparts, were, according to Joſephus, 40 cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits long, 12 thick, and 8 high, all of poliſhed marble, and ſo well joined as to appear like one ſolid rock.</p>
            <p n="9">9. After the deſtruction of this temple, it is ſaid that the emperor Julian attempted to rebuild it, in order to give the lie to our Saviour's prophecy, namely, that it ſhould be totally deſtroyed without one ſtone's being left upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. In this, however, he was defeated by earthquakes, fiery eruptions, &amp;c. which deſtroyed his materials, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led many of his workmen.</p>

            <head>THE FAITHFUL AMERICAN DOG.</head>
            <p>AN officer in the late American army, on his ſtation at the weſtward, went out in the morning with his dog and gun, in queſt of game. Venturing too far from the garriſon, he was fired upon by an Indian, who was lurk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the buſhes, and inſtantly fell to the ground.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Indian running to him, ſtruck him on the head with his tomahawk in order to diſpatch him; but the but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton of his hat fortunately warding off the edge, he was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtunned by the blow. With ſavage brutality he applied the ſcalping knife, and haſtened away with this trophy of his horrid cruelty, leaving the officer for dead, and none to relieve or conſole him, but his faithful dog.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The afflicted creature gave every expreſſion of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment, fidelity, and affection. He licked the wounds with inexpreſſible tenderneſs, and mourned the fate of his beloved maſter. Having performed every office which ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy dictated, or ſagacity could invent, without being able to remove his maſter from the fatal ſpot, or procure from him any ſigns of life, or his wonted expreſſions of affection to him, he ran off in queſt of help.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Bending his courſe towards the river, where two men were fiſhing, he urged them by all the powers of native rhet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oric to accompany him to the woods. The men were ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of a decoy to an ambuſcade, and dared not venture to follow the dog; who, finding all his careſſes fail, return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the care of his maſter; and, licking his wounds a ſecond time, renewed all his tenderneſſes; but with no better ſucceſs than before.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Again he returned to the men; once more to try his ſkill in alluring them to his aſſiſtance. In this attempt he was more ſucceſsful than in the other. The men ſeeing his ſolicitude, began to think the dog might have diſcovered ſome valuable game, and determined to hazard the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of following him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Tranſported with his ſucceſs, the affectionate crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hurried them along by every expreſſion of ardor. Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently they arrive at the ſpot, where behold—an officer

wounded, ſcalped, weltering in his own gore, and faint with the loſs of blood.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Suffice it to ſay, he was yet alive. They carried him to the fort, where the firſt dreſſings were performed. A ſuppuration immediately took place, and he was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the hoſpital at Albany, where in a few weeks, he entirely recovered, and was able to return to his duty.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This worthy officer owed his life, probably, to the fidelity of this ſagacious dog. His tongue, which the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman afterwards declared gave him the moſt exquiſite pleaſure, clarified the wound in the moſt effectual manner, and his perſeverance brought that aſſiſtance, without which he muſt ſoon have periſhed.</p>

            <p>THE Stork is generally eſteemed an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of filial love; inſomuch, that it has ever acquired the name of <hi>pious,</hi> from the juſt regard it is ſaid to pay to acts of filial piety and duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Storks live to a very advanced age; the conſequence of which is, that their limbs grow feeble, their feathers fall off, and they are no ways capable of providing for their own food or ſafety. Being birds of paſſage, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another inconvenience alſo, which is, that they are not able to remove themſelves from one country to another at the uſual ſeaſon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In all theſe circumſtances it is reported that their young ones aſſiſt them, covering them with their wings, and nouriſhing them with the warmth of their bodies; even bringing them proviſions in their beaks, and carrying them from place to place on their backs, or ſupporting them with their wings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In this manner they return, as much as lies in their power, the care which was beſtowed on them when they
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026674_0031_0FD1557DE0B9F1E8"/>

            <p n="5">5. "Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee," was an expreſs commandment, and the only one to which a promiſe was annexed. Among the Iſraelites, the ſlighteſt offence againſt a parent was puniſhed in the moſt exemplary manner.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Certainly nothing can be more juſt or reaſonable, than that we ſhould love, honor, and ſuccor thoſe who are the very authors of our being, and to whoſe tender care (under Heaven) we owe the continuance of it, during the helpleſs ſtate of our infancy.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Love, charity, and an intercourſe of good offices, are what we undoubtedly owe to all mankind; and he who omits them is guilty of ſuch a crime as generally carries its puniſhment with it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But to our parents, more, much more than all this, is due; and, when we are ſerving them, we ought to reflect, that whatever difficulties we go through for their ſakes, we cannot do more for them than they have done for us; and that there is no danger of our over-paying the vaſt debt of gratitude they have laid us under.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In fine, we ſhould conſider that it is a duty moſt pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly inſiſted on by Heaven itſelf; and, if we obey the command, there is no doubt but we ſhall alſo receive the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward annexed to it.</p>

Then the Bees retire to their hive, which is formed like a little ſtate, and governed by a Queen, who diſpenſes juſtice to her ſubjects. It is ſaid they bury their dead, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh criminals, and drive the drones from their hive. They keep a regular order, whether in war or peace; and, as ſoon as their Queen dies, appoint another to ſucceed her, and rule their little ſtate, which may ſerve as a pattern for a well ordered community.</p>

            <p n="2">2. During this queen's reign, perſecution for religion was carried to the moſt terrible height. The mild counſels of cardinal Pole, who was inclined to toleration, was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by Gardner and Bonner; and multitudes of all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, ages, and ſexes, were committed to the flames.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The perſecutors began with Rogers, prebendary of St. Paul's; a man equally diſtinguiſhed by his p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="8">8. Latimer, when tied to the ſtake, called to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, "Be of good cheer, my brother; we ſhall this day kindle ſuch a flame in England, as I truſt in God will never be extinguiſhed."</p>
            <p n="9">9. Sanders, a reſpectable clergyman, was committed to the flames at Coventry. A pardon was offered him, if he would recant; but he rejected it with diſdain, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the ſtake, ſaying, "Welcome, croſs of Chriſt! welcome, everlaſting life!"</p>
            <p n="10">10. Cranmer had leſs courage at firſt. Terrified by the proſpect of thoſe tortures which awaited him, or overcome by the fond love of life, and by the flattery of artful men, who pompouſly repreſented the dignities to which his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter ſtill entitled him, if he would merit them by a recanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he agreed, in an unguarded hour, to ſubſcribe to the doctrines of the papal ſupremacy, and the real preſence.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But the court, no leſs perfidious than cruel, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that this recantation ſhould avail him nothing; that he ſhould acknowledge his errors in the church before the people, and afterwards be led to execution.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Whether Cranmer received ſecret intelligence of their deſign, or repented of his weakneſs, or both, is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; but he ſurpriſed the audience by a declaration, very different from what was expected.</p>
            <p n="13">13. After explaining his ſenſe of what he owed to God and his ſovereign, "There is one miſcarriage in my life, ſaid he, of which, above all others, I ſeverely repent; and that is, the inſincere declaration of faith, to which I had the weakneſs to ſubſcribe.</p>
            <p n="14">14. "But I take this opportunity of atoning for my error, by a ſincere and open recantation; and am willing to ſeal with my blood that doctrine, which I firmly believe to be communicated from heaven."</p>

He accordingly ſtretched it out, as ſoon as he came to the ſtake; and without diſcovering, either by his looks or motions, the leaſt ſign of weakneſs, or even feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he held it in the flames till it was entirely conſumed.</p>
            <p n="16">16. His thoughts, to uſe the words of an elegant and learned hiſtorian, appeared to be totally occupied in reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his former fault; and he called aloud ſeveral times, "This hand has offended!

            <p n="17">17. When it dropped off, he diſcovered a ſerenity in his countenance, as if ſatisfied with ſacrificing to divine juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice the inſtrument of his crime.

            <head>STORY OF LOGAN, A MINGO CHIEF.</head>
            <p>IN the ſpring of the year 1774, a robbery and murder were committed on an inhabitant of the frontiers of Virginia by two Indians, of the Shawaneſe tribe. The neighboring whites, according to their cuſtom, undertook to puniſh this outrage in a ſummary way. Colonel Creſap, a man infamous for the many murders he had committed on thoſe much injured people, collected a party, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded down the Kanhaway in queſt of vengeance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Unfortunately, a canoe of women and children, with one man only, was ſeen coming from the oppoſite ſhore, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, and unſuſpecting any hoſtile attack from the whites. Creſap and his party concealed themſelves on the bank of the river; and the moment the canoe reached the ſhore, ſingled out their objects, and, at one fire, killed every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This happened to be the family of Logan, who had long been diſtinguiſhed as the friend of the whites. This unworthy return provoked his vengeance. He accordingly ſignalized himſelf in the war which enſued.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:026674_0036_0FD15587B2DB8BE8"/>4. In the autumn of the ſame year, a deciſive battle was fought at the mouth of the Great Kanhaway, between the collected forces of the Shawaneſe, Mingoes, and Delawares, and a detachment of the Virginia militia. The Indians were defeated, and ſued for peace.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Logan, however, diſdained to be ſeen among the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliants; but, leſt the ſincerity of a treaty ſhould be diſtruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from which ſo diſtinguiſhed a chief abſented himſelf, he ſent by a meſſenger, the following ſpeech, to be delivered to Lord Dunmore.</p>
            <p n="6">6. "I appeal to any white man to ſay if ever he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him no meat; if ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he came cold and naked, and he clothed him not. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt long and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin, an advocate for peace."</p>
            <p n="7">7. "Such was my love for the whites, that my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen pointed as they paſſed by, and ſaid, <hi>Logan is the friend of white men.</hi> I had even thought to have lived with you, had it not been for the injuries of one man. Colonel Creſap, the laſt ſpring, in cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the relations of Logan, not even ſparing my women and children."</p>
            <p n="8">8. "There runs not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature. This called on me for revenge. I have ſought it; I have killed many; I have fully glutted my vengeance. For my country, I rejoice at the beams of peace; but do not harbor a thought that mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not turn on his heel to ſave his life. Who is there to mourn for Logan? Not one."</p>

            <head>THE AGED PRISONER, RELEASED FROM THE BASTILE.</head>
            <p>NOWHERE elſe on earth, perhaps, has hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man miſery, by human means, been rendered ſo laſting, ſo complete, or ſo remedileſs as in that deſpotic priſon, the Baſtile. This the following caſe may ſuffice to evince; the particulars of which are tranſlated from that elegant and energetic writer Mr. Mercier.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:026674_0037_0FD15587BAB17788"/>2. The heinous offence which merited an impriſonment ſurpaſſing torture, and rendering death a bleſſing, was no more than ſome unguarded expreſſions, implying diſreſpect towards the late Gallic monarch, Louis fifteenth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Upon the acceſſion of Louis ſixteenth to the throne, the miniſters then in office, moved by humanity, began their adminiſtration with an act of clemency and juſtice. They inſpected the regiſters of the Baſtile, and ſet many priſoners at liberty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Among thoſe, there was an old man who had groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in confinement for forty ſeven years, between four thick and cold ſtone-walls. Hardened by adverſity, which ſtrengthens both the mind and conſtitution, when they are not overpowered by it, he had reſiſted the horrors of his long impriſonment with an invincible and manly ſpirit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His locks, white, thin, and ſcattered, had almoſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired the rigidity of iron; whilſt his body, environed for ſo long a time by a coffin of ſtone, had borrowed from it a firm and compact habit. The narrow door of his tomb, turning upon its grating hinges, opened not as uſual by halves, and an unknown voice announced his liberty, and bade him depart.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Believing this to be a dream, he heſitated; but at length roſe up and walked forth with trembling ſteps, ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed at the ſpace he traverſed. The ſtairs of the priſon, the halls, the court ſeemed to him vaſt, immenſe, and almoſt without bounds.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He ſtopped from time to time, and gazed around like a bewildered traveller. His viſion was with difficulty reconciled to the clear light of day. He contemplated the heavens as a new object. His eyes remained fixed, and he could not even weep.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Stupified with the newly acquired power of changing his poſition, his limbs, like his tongue, refuſed in ſpite of his efforts, to perform their office. At length he got through the formidable gate.</p>
            <p n="9">9. When he felt the motion of the carriage, which was prepared to tranſport him to his former habitation, he ſcreamed out, and uttered ſome inarticulate ſounds; and as he could not bear this new movement, he was obliged to deſcend. Supported by a benevolent arm, he ſought out
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026674_0038_0FD15589EA4716F0"/>
the ſtreet where he had formerly reſided; he found it, but no trace of his houſe remained; one of the public edifices occupied the ſpot where it had ſtood.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He now ſaw nothing which brought to his recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, either that particular quarter, the city itſelf, or the objects with which he was formerly acquainted. The houſes of his neareſt neighbors, which were freſh in his memory, had aſſumed a new appearance.</p>
            <p n="11">11. In vain were his looks directed to all the objects around him; he could diſcover nothing of which he had the ſmalleſt remembrance. Terrified, he ſtopped and fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a deep ſigh. To him what did it import, that the city was peopled with living creatures? None of them were alive to him; he was unknown to all the world, and he knew nobody; and whilſt he wept, he regretted his dungeon.</p>
            <p n="12">12. At the name of the Baſtile, which he often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and even claimed as an aſylum, and the ſight of his clothes which marked his former age, the croud gathered around him; curioſity, blended with pity, excited their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention. The moſt aged aſked him many queſtions, but had no remembrance of the circumſtances which he recap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itulated.</p>
            <p n="13">13. At length accident brought to his way an ancient domeſtic, now a ſuperannuated porter, who, confined to his lodge for fifteen years, had barely ſufficient ſtrength to open the gate. Even <hi>he</hi> did not know the maſter he had ſerved; but informed him that grief and misfortune had brought his wife to the grave thirty years before; that his children were gone abroad to diſtant climes, and that of all his relations and friends, none now remained.</p>
            <p n="14">14. This recital was made with the indifference which people diſcover for events long paſſed and almoſt forgotten. The miſerable man groaned, and groaned alone. The croud around, offering only unknown features to his view, made him feel the exceſs of his calamities even more than he would have done in the dreadful ſolitude which he had left.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Overcome with ſorrow, he preſented himſelf before the miniſter, to whoſe humanity he owed that liberty which was now a burden to him. Bowing down, he ſaid, "Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore me again to that priſon from which you have taken me. I cannot ſurvive the loſs of my neareſt relations; of my
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:026674_0039_0FD1558B602A6000"/>
friends; and in one word, of a whole generation. Is it poſſible in the ſame moment to be informed of this univerſal deſtruction, and not to wiſh for death?</p>
            <p n="16">16. "This general mortality, which to others comes ſlowly and by degrees, has to me been inſtantaneous, the operation of a moment. Whilſt ſecluded from ſociety, I lived with myſelf only; but here I can neither live with myſelf, nor with this new race, to whom my anguiſh and deſpair appear only as a dream."</p>
            <p n="17">17. The miniſter was melted; he cauſed the old domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic to attend this unfortunate perſon, as only <hi>he</hi> could talk to him of his family.</p>
            <p n="18">18. This diſcourſe was the ſingle conſolation which he received; for he ſhunned intercourſe with the new race, born ſince he had been exiled from the world; and he paſſed his time in the midſt of Paris in the ſame ſolitude as he had done whilſt confined in a dungeon for almoſt half a century.</p>
            <p n="19">19. But the chagrin and mortification of meeting no perſon who could ſay to him, "We were fomerly known to each other," ſoon put an end to his exiſtence.</p>

            <head>ACCOUNT OF COLUMBUS.</head>
            <p>TO Chriſtopher Columbus, a native of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noa, is deſervedly aſcribed the firſt diſcovery of America: an event, which opened to mankind a new region of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, commerce, and enterprize; and ſtamped with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality the name of its projector.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He was born in the year 1447. He early ſhowed a capacity and inclination for a ſea-faring life, and received an education which qualified him to purſue it. At the age of fourteen, he went to ſea, and began his career on that element, where he was to perform exploits, which ſhould aſtoniſh mankind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He made a variety of voyages to almoſt every part of the globe, with which any intercourſe was then carried on by ſea; and became one of the moſt ſkilful navigators in Europe. But his active and enterprizing genius would
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026674_0040_0FD1558CE517C9E0"/>
not ſuffer him to reſt in the deciſions, and tamely follow the track of his predeceſſors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was the great object in view at this time in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, to find out a paſſage by ſea to the Eaſt Indies. The Portugueſe, among whom he now reſided, ſought a new route to theſe deſirable regions, by ſailing round the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern extremity of Africa.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They had conſumed half a century in making vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attempts, and had advanced no farther on the weſtern ſhore of Africa than juſt to croſs the equator, when Colum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus conceived his great deſign of finding India in the weſt. The ſpherical figure of the earth, which he underſtood, made it evident to him, that Europe, Aſia and Africa formed but a ſmall proportion of the globe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It was an impeachment of the wiſdom and benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the Author of nature, to ſuppoſe that the vaſt ſpace, yet unexplored, was a waſte, unprofitable ocean; and it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared neceſſary that there ſhould be anoth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> continent in the weſt to counterpoiſe the immenſe quantity of land, which was known to be in the eaſt.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the ſea, near the weſtern iſlands, pieces of carv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wood, and large joints of cane had been diſcovered; and branches of pine trees and the bodies of two men with features different from the Europeans, had been found on the ſhores of thoſe iſlands after a courſe of weſterly winds.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Theſe reaſonings and facts, with ſome others, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced Columbus that it was poſſible to find the deſired land by ſailing in a weſterly direction. He had a genius of that kind, which makes uſe of reaſoning only as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement to action. No ſooner was he ſatisfied of the truth of his ſyſtem than he was anxious to bring it to the teſt of experiment; and ſet out on a voyage of diſcovery.</p>
            <p n="9">9. His firſt ſtep was to ſecure the patronage of ſome of the conſiderable powers of Europe, capable of undertaking ſuch an enterprize. Excited by the love of his country, he laid his ſcheme before the Senate of Genoa, offering to ſail under their banners. But they, ignorant of the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on which it was formed, rejected it as the dream of a viſionary projector.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He next applied to John II. king of Portugal. But he, being deeply engaged in proſecuting diſcoveries along the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026674_0041_0FD1558E8A82C7D8"/>
coaſt of Africa, was not inclined to encourage the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking of Columbus; yet he meanly ſought to rob him of the glory and advantages of his ſcheme, by privately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patching a ſhip to make a diſcovery in the weſt.</p>
            <p n="11">11. When Columbus was acquainted with this perfid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious tranſaction, he quitted the kingdom with indignation, and landed in Spain in 1484. Here, after ſeven years pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſolicitation at court, and ſurmounting every obſtacle, which ignorance, timidity, jealouſy and avarice could lay before him, he obtained his requeſt; and Ferdinand and Iſabella, who then reigned together, agreed to be patrons of his enterprize.</p>
            <p n="12">12. It was ſtipulated between him and them, that he ſhould be admiral in all thoſe iſlands and continents he ſhould diſcover, and have the office hereditary in his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; that he ſhould be viceroy of the ſame for life, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy a tenth of all the merchandize which ſhould be found.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Three ſmall veſſels were fitted out and victualled for twelve months, furniſhed with ninety men, and placed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his command. With this little fleet he ſet ſail from Palos on Friday the 3d of Auguſt, 1492; and taking a weſterly courſe, boldly ventured into the unknown ocean.</p>
            <p n="14">14. He ſoon found that he had unforeſeen hardſhips and difficulties to encounter from the inexperience and fears of his men. To go directly from home into a boundleſs ocean, far from any hope of relief, if any accident ſhould befal them, and where no friendly port nor human being were known to exiſt, filled the boldeſt ſeamen with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion.</p>
            <p n="15">15. What greatly added to their terror, was a new and extraordinary phenomenon, which occurred on the 14th of September. The magnetic needle varied from the pole, and as they advanced, the variation increaſed. Nature ſeemed to be changed; and their only guide through the trackleſs waters, to prove unfaithful.</p>
            <p n="16">16. After twenty days, the impatient ſailors began to talk of throwing their commander into the ſea, and of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning home. Their murmurs reached his ears; but his fertile mind ſuggeſted an expedient in every extremity. By ſoothing, flattery, and artifice; by inventing reaſons for
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:026674_0042_0FD1558FD95FD980"/>
every uncommon appearance, and deceiving them in the ſhip's reckoning, he kept them on ſixteen days longer.</p>
            <p n="17">17. On the night of the 11th of October, he himſelf diſcovered a light, which appeared to move, and the next morning gave them the joyful ſight of land. It proved to be the iſland Guanahana, one of the cluſter, called Baha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas. Thus, in the ſpace of thirty ſix days, and the forty fifth year of his age, Columbus completed a voyage, which he had ſpent twenty years in projecting; which opened to the Europeans a new world, and made the name of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumbus immortal.</p>
            <p n="18">18. With tears of joy and tranſports of congratulation, the crews of the ſhips ſang a hymn of thankſgiving to God. After touching at ſeveral iſlands, and leaving a ſmall colony, he returned to Spain. On his return he was overtaken by a ſtorm, which became ſo furious that his deſtruction ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inevitable. The crews abandoned themſelves to deſpair, and expected every moment to be ſwallowed up in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aves.</p>
            <p n="19">19. In this extremity, he gave an admirable proof of his calmneſs and foreſight. He wrote a ſhort account of his voyage on parchment, incloſed it in a cake of wax, which he put into a tight caſk, and threw into the ſea, in hopes that ſome fortunate accident would preſerve a depoſit of ſo much importance to the world. The ſtorm however ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, and he arrived at Palos in Spain on the 15th of March, 1493.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The populace received him with acclamations, and the King and Queen, no leſs aſtoniſhed than delighted with his ſucceſs, had him conducted to court with a pomp ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the event, which added ſuch diſtinguiſhed luſtre to their reign. His family was ennobled; and his former privileges and offices confirmed to him.</p>
            <p n="21">21. He ſoon ſailed on a ſecond expedition to the new world, with a fleet of ſeventeen ſhips, having on board 1500 people, and all things neceſſary for eſtabliſhing plantations. After diſcovering many iſlands of the Weſt Indies, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to every labor and vexation in attempting to ſettle his colony, he returned to Spain in 1498, to counteract the intrigues and efforts of his enemies in the Spaniſh court.</p>
            <p n="22">22. He made two more voyages, in which he touched at moſt parts of the Weſt Indies, diſcovered the continent,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026674_0043_0FD155942EF75C78"/>
and coaſted on its ſhores for 400 leagues. But the laſt part of his life was made wretched by the perſecutions of his enemies.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Their pride and jealouſy could not endure that a foreigner ſhould attain ſo high a rank as to be viceroy for life, and have the office of admiral hereditary in his family, to the excluſion of the Spaniſh nobles. They were, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, indefatigable in their endeavors to depreciate his merits, and ruin his fortune.</p>
            <p n="24">24. He was once carried home in irons; and in viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gratitude, humanity, and juſtice, baſely deprived of all the offices and poſſeſſions in the new world, to which he had a right by the ſolemn ſtipulations of Ferdinand. When he returned from his laſt voyage in 1505, Queen Iſabella, his only friend and patroneſs in the court of Spain, was dead.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Worn out with ſickneſs and fatigue, diſguſted with the inſincerity of his Sovereign and the haughtineſs of his courtiers, he lingered out a year in fruitleſs ſolicitations for his violated rights, till death relieved him from his ſorrows. He ended his uſeful and active life at Valladolid on the 10th of May, 1506, in the 59th year of his age.</p>
            <p n="26">26. In the life of this remarkable man, there was no deficiency of any quality, which can conſtitute a great char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter. He was grave, though courteous in his deportment, circumſpect in his words and actions, irreproachable in his morals, and exemplary in all the duties of religion.</p>
            <p n="27">27. The court of Spain were ſo juſt to his memory, that, notwithſtanding their ingratitude towards him during his life, they buried him magnificently in the Cathedral of Seville, and erected a tomb over him with this inſcription,

            <head>DESCRIPTION OF BABYLON.</head>
            <p>THE firſt foundation of Babylon, is, by ſome authors, aſcribed to Semiramis, and by others to Belus. Who the founder was, is not ſo material; but it is certain that Nebuchadnezzar was the perſon who raiſed it to ſuch a pinnacle of glory, as that it became one of the principal wonders of the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The walls of this city were 60 miles in circumfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 350 feet high, and 87 feet thick. The city was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly ſquare, meaſuring 15 miles upon every ſide. The walls were built with large bricks, cemented together with a kind of glutinous ſlime, ſuperior to any lime, and which grows harder than the bricks themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They were encompaſſed by a vaſt ditch lined with bricks, cemented with the ſame kind of bitumen, and filled with water. The earth which was dug from the ditch ſerved to make the bricks for the walls: it muſt, therefore, have been of great depth and width.</p>
            <p n="4">4. On every ſide of the city were 25 brazen gates, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to each other. Between every two of theſe gates were three towers, and four more at the angles, and three between each of the angles and the next gate on every ſide.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The towers were all ten feet higher than the walls. Streets interſected each other at right angles from all the gates on every ſide, being 15 miles in length, and 50 in number. Thus was the city cut into 676 ſquares.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The hanging gardens were a great curioſity. They contained a ſquare of 400 feet, and were carried to the height of the wall of the city by ſeveral large terraces. This vaſt pile was ſuſtained by arches built upon arches, and ſtrengthened by a wall 22 feet thick on every ſide.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Theſe gardens contained all kinds of flowers and plants, and even large trees. On the upper terrace was an aqueduct, which ſerved to water the whole.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:026674_0046_0FD15599E0982590"/>8. The Tigris, a branch of the river Euphrates, ran through the city from north to ſouth. After Cyrus had beſieged the city two years, he found means to turn the courſe of this river, and marched his army under the walls through its channel. This was done on the night in which Belſhazzar and his nobles were revelling at the banquet; who were all ſlain, and the city taken.</p>

            <head>THE SAILOR AND THE MONKIES.</head>
            <p>PERHAPS no animal, below the human ſpecies, reſembles man more in the imitative faculty than the monkey. It is ſaid that a ſailor, having a number of red woollen caps to diſpoſe of, went on ſhore in South America to trade with the natives.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In his way to a ſettlement, lying through a wood very thickly inhabited by monkies, it being in the heat of the day, he put a cap on his head, and laying the others by his ſide, determined to take a little repoſe under the ſhade of a large tree.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To his utter aſtoniſhment, when he awoke, from the ſpecimen he had given his imitative obſervers of the uſe of his caps, he beheld a number of them upon the heads of the monkies in the trees round about him; while the wearers were chattering in the moſt unuſual manner.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Finding every attempt to regain his caps fruitleſs, he at length in a fit of rage and diſappointment, and under the ſuppoſition that the one he retained on his head was not worth taking away, pulled it off, and throwing it upon the ground, exclaimed, "Here, you little thieving rogues, if you will keep the reſt, you are welcome to this alſo."</p>
            <p n="5">5. He had no ſooner done this, than, to his great ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, the little obſerving animals very readily imitated him. They all threw down their caps upon the ground; by which means the ſailor regained his property, and marched off in triumph. Happy would it be for mankind, if they reſembled monkies only in imitating the <hi>virtues</hi> of thoſe whom they conſider their ſuperiors, while they avoided their <hi>vices.</hi>

            <head>THE BRAVE SOLDIER'S REVENGE.</head>
            <p>WHEN the great Conde commanded the Spaniſh army, and laid ſiege to one of the French towns in Flanders, a ſoldier being ill treated by a general officer, and ſtruck ſeveral times with a cane, for ſome diſreſpectful words he had let fall, anſwered very coolly, that he ſhould ſoon make him repent of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fifteen days afterwards, the ſame general officer ordered the colonel of the trenches to find a bold and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepid fellow, to execute an important enterpriſe, for which he promiſed a reward of a hundred piſtoles.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſoldier we are ſpeaking of, who paſſed for the braveſt in the regiment, offered his ſervice, and going with thirty of his comrades, which he had the liberty to make choice of, he diſcharged a very hazardous commiſſion with incredible courage and good fortune. Upon his return, the general officer highly commended him, and gave him the hundred piſtoles which he had promiſed.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſoldier preſently diſtributed them among his comrades, ſaying, he did not ſerve for <hi>pay;</hi> and demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only, that, if his late action deſerved any recompenſe, they would make him an officer. And now, ſir, adds he to the general, who did not know him, I am the ſoldier whom you ſo much abuſed fifteen days ago, and I then told you, I would make you repent of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The general, in great admiration, and melting into tears, threw his arms around his neck, begged his pardon, and gave him a commiſſion that very day.</p>

            <head>AN ORATION UPON FEMALE EDUCATION, PRONOUNCED BY A MEMBER OF ONE OF THE PUB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIC SCHOOLS IN BOSTON,
<date>SEPTEMBER, 1791.</date>
            </head>
            <p>WHILE the great and the rich are contrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uting from their abundance, to the ſtock which ſupports our youth in knowledge, we come, ambitious to contribute <hi>our</hi> mite.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:026674_0048_0FD1559CB6FECBE0"/>2. The education of youth has ever been conſidered by all civilized nations as an object of the higheſt conſequence. But, while they have paid flattering attention to the <hi>ſtrength,</hi> they have doubtleſs too much neglected the <hi>beauty</hi> and <hi>or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament</hi> of creation.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Too long has the pride of man ſuffered <hi>female</hi> genius, like the unpoliſhed diamond, to lie buried in its native rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſh. A few, of every age, have broken over all reſtraint, and ſhone, as it were, with their own native light, evincive of the genius of their ſex.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The illuſtrious women, both of ancient and of mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern days, will ever fill a diſtinguiſhed page in hiſtory. The names of MACAULAY, ROWE, MOORE, CHAPONE, and others, will live as long as time ſhall laſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And how pleaſing is the thought, that here on this weſtern ſhore, we can juſtly boaſt of a WARREN, a MOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TON, an ADAMS, with many others; whoſe talents and virtues ornament their ſex, and excite emulation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Happy for the fair daughters of America, the thick miſts of ſuperſtition and bigotry are vaniſhing away; and the ſun of ſcience begins to beam upon our land, and to ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiate the <hi>female</hi> mind.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Let infant choirs, compoſed of male and female voices, join in praiſe of our political fathers, and all patrons of ſcience. They have, doubtleſs, reflected on the vaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of <hi>female</hi> education to a riſing country.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They have conſidered how much the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of every age, are indebted to their <hi>mothers</hi> for the ſeeds of virtue and knowledge; that ſchools and colleges can but cultivate and mature the plants, which owe their origin to the ſeeds ſown in infancy; that from <hi>maternal</hi> lips, our firſt accents are formed; and, that from <hi>them,</hi> our words, our actions, nay, our every thought proceeds.</p>
            <p n="9">9. What an argument this, that <hi>they</hi> ſhould well be taught, from whom our virtues <hi>are,</hi> and from whom our vices <hi>may</hi> be derived! And may we not indulge an honeſt pride, that this metropolis has been one of the foremoſt in exertions to promote female improvement?</p>
            <p n="10">10. While the <hi>ſons</hi> of our citizens are cultivating their minds, and preparing them for the arduous, important, and manly employments, which America offers to the induſtrious,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:026674_0049_0FD1559ECCC69D58"/>
their <hi>daughters</hi> are gaining that knowledge, which will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able them to become amiable ſiſters, virtuous children; and, in the event, to aſſume characters, more intereſting to the public, and more endearing to themſelves than both.</p>
            <p n="11">11. How tranſporting are the proſpects of America! With what juſtice can it challenge the reality of that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic eulogy? "Bleſſed is that nation, whoſe ſons and daughters are trained to virtue, honor, and uſefulneſs; whoſe ſchools are as broad rivers and ſtreams. Yea, bleſſed is that people, whoſe daughters wear the robes of innocence, and whoſe young <hi>Eliſhas</hi> riſe up in ſucceſſion, and wear with dignity the mantles of their departed <hi>Elijahs.</hi>"</p>
            <p n="12">12. If parents wiſh to guard their children againſt an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due attention to external ornaments, againſt extravagance in dreſs and gaudy equipage, what better expedient will they find, than to repleniſh their minds with ſuch a fund of uſeful knowledge, as ſhall enable them ſuitably to contemn all worthleſs things; to diſcern where real merit lies, and what conſtitutes the dignity of their ſex?</p>
            <p n="13">13. Then they will not eaſily be captivated with glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trappings, trifling toys, and taſteleſs amuſements; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their views to more noble objects. What greater bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier againſt vice of every kind than uſeful knowledge?</p>
            <p n="14">14. Is it not a melancholy truth, that <hi>man</hi> too often proſtitutes his boaſted faculties to the deſtruction of female happineſs? How neceſſary then, to fortify their minds againſt the attacks of ſuch vile ſeducers? Blemiſhes in fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male characters ſeldom are effaced. Not ſo with man. He tarniſhes his name, and brightens it again.</p>
            <p n="15">15. But if woman chance to ſwerve from the ſtricteſt rules of virtue,

            <p n="18">18. Every natural, civil, and religious right is ours, by the legacy of Heaven. Here ſcience has opened her treaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures; and here liberty has erected her ſtandard, and bids defiance to deſpotiſm.</p>

               <p>Friend, I pretend to no glory; far be it from me to glory. But this I ſay, that I was inſtrumental in execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a more glorious work than that performed by thee; incomparably more glorious.</p>

That I made him my priſoner in his own capital; and, after he had been depoſed and ſlain by his ſubjects, vanquiſhed and took Guatemozin, his ſucceſſor, and accompliſhed my conqueſt of the whole Mexican empire, which I loyally annexed to the Spaniſh crown? Doſt thou not know, that, in doing theſe wonderful acts, I ſhowed as much courage as Alexander the great, and as much prudence as Caeſar?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Penn.</speaker>
               <p>I know very well that thou waſt as fierce as a lion, and as ſubtle as a ſerpent. The prince of darkneſs may, perhaps, place thee as high upon his black liſt of heroes as Alexander or Caeſar. It is not my buſineſs to interfere with him in ſettling thy rank.

               <speaker>Penn.</speaker>
               <p>An honeſt right of fair purchaſe. We gave the native Indians a variety of articles which they wanted; and they, in return, gave us lands which they did not want. All was amicably agreed on; and not a drop of blood ſhed to ſtain our acquiſition.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cort.</speaker>
               <p>I am afraid there was a little fraud in the purchaſe. Thy followers, William Penn, are ſaid to think that cheat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in a quiet and ſober way, is no moral ſin.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Penn.</speaker>
               <p>The righteous are always calumniated by the wicked. But it was a ſight which an angel might contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate with delight, to behold the colony which I ſettled! To ſee us living with the Indians like innocent lambs, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the ferocity of their manners by the gentleneſs of ours! To ſee the whole country, which before was an uncultivated wilderneſs, rendered as fair and as fertile as the garden of Eden! O Fernando Cortez! Fernando Cortez! didſt thou leave the great Mexican empire in that ſtate? No, thou didſt turn thoſe delightful and populous regions into a deſert, a deſert flooded with blood. Doſt thou not remember that moſt infernal ſcene, when the noble emperor Guatemozin was ſtretched out by thy ſoldiers upon hot burning coals, to make him diſcover into what part of the lake of Mexico he had thrown the royal treaſures? Are not his groans ever ſounding in the ears of thy conſcience? Do they not rend thy hard heart, and ſtrike thee with more horror than the yells of the furies?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Cort.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Penn.</speaker>
               <p>Thou waſt the captain of that band of robbers, who did this horrid deed. The advantage they had drawn from thy counſels and conduct enabled them to commit it; and thy ſkill ſaved them afterwards from the vengeance which was due to ſo enormous a crime. The enraged Mexicans would have properly puniſhed them for It, if they had not had thee for their general, thou hard-hearted, blood-thirſty wretch.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cort.</speaker>
               <p>The <hi>righteous</hi> I find can <hi>rail,</hi> William Penn. But how do you hope to preſerve this admirable colony you have ſettled? Your people, you tell me, live like innocent lambs.
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:026674_0054_0FD155A8A02BE6A0"/>
Are there no wolves in America to devour thoſe lambs? Do you expect the natives will always continue in peace with your ſucceſſors? Or, if they ſhould make war, do you expect to oppoſe them by prayers and preſents? If this be your policy, your devoted colony will ſoon become an eaſy prey to the ſavages of the wilderneſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Penn.</speaker>
               <p>We leave that to the wiſe Diſpoſer of events, who governs all nations at his will. If we conduct with ſtrict juſtice towards the Indians, He will doubtleſs defend us againſt all their invaſions.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cort.</speaker>
               <p>Is this the wiſdom of a great legiſlator! I have heard ſome of your countrymen compare you to Solon! Did Solon, think you, give laws to a people, and leave thoſe laws and that people to the mercy of every invader? The firſt buſineſs of a legiſlature is to provide a military ſtrength which may defend the whole ſyſtem. The world, William Penn, is a land of robbers. Any ſtate or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth erected therein muſt be well fenced and ſecured by good military inſtitutions; or, the happier it is in all oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reſpects, the greater will be its danger, the more ſpeedy its deſtruction. Your plan of government muſt be changed; theſe Indian nations muſt be extirpated, or your colony will be loſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Penn.</speaker>
               <p>Theſe are ſuggeſtions of human wiſdom. The doctrines I held were inſpired. They came from above.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Cort.</speaker>
               <p>It is blaſphemy to ſay that any folly could come from the fountain of wiſdom. Whatever is inconſiſtent with the great laws of nature cannot be the effect of inſpiration. Self-defence is as neceſſary to nations as to men. And ſhall individuals have a right which nations have not? True religion, William Penn, is never inconſiſtent with reaſon and the great laws of nature.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Penn.</speaker>
               <p>Though what thou ſayeſt ſhould be true, it does not come well from thy mouth. A <hi>tyrant</hi> talk of reaſon! Go to the inquiſition, and tell them of reaſon, and the great laws of nature. They will broil thee, as thy ſoldiers broiled the unhappy Guatemozin.—Why doſt thou turn pale? Is it the name of the inquiſition, or the name of Guatemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zin, which troubles and affrights thee? O wretched man! I wonder not that thou doſt tremble and ſhake, when thou thinkeſt of the many murders thou haſt committed, the many

thouſands of thoſe innocent Indians thou haſt butchered, without an accuſation of a crime! Remember there is a day coming when thou muſt anſwer for all thy barbarities! What wouldſt thou give to part with the renown of thy conqueſts, and to have a conſcience as pure and undiſturbed as mine?</p>

            <head>THE WHISTLE.</head>
            <p>WHEN I was a child, at ſeven years old, ſays Dr. Franklin, my friends on a holiday filled my little pockets with coppers. I went directly to a ſhop where they ſold toys for children; and being charmed with the ſound of a Whiſtle, which I met by the way, in the hands of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other boy, I voluntarily offered, and gave all my money for one.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I then came home, and went whiſtling all over the houſe, much pleaſed with my Whiſtle; but diſturbing all the family. My brothers and ſiſters, and couſins, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the bargain I had made, told me, I had given four times as much for it, as it was worth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This put me in mind of what good things I might have bought with the reſt of the money. And they laughed at me ſo much for my folly, that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the Whiſtle gave me pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This, however, was afterwards of uſe to me; the impreſſion continuing on my mind, ſo that often when I was tempted to buy ſome unneceſſary thing, I ſaid to myſelf, <hi>Don't give too much for the Whiſtle.</hi> And ſo I ſaved my money.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As I grew up and came into the world, and obſerved the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, <hi>who gave too much for the Whiſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. When I ſaw one too ambitious of court favors, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing his time in attendance at levees, his repoſe, his lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty,

his virtue, and perhaps his friends, to attain it, I have ſaid to myſelf, <hi>This man gives too much for his Whiſtle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. When I ſaw another fond of popularity, conſtantly employing himſelf in political buſtles, neglecting his own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and ruining them by that neglect, <hi>He pays indeed,</hi> ſaid I, <hi>too much for his Whiſtle.</hi>
            </p>

            </p>
            <p n="9">9. When I meet with a man of pleaſure, ſacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind, or of his fortune, to mere corporal ſenſations, and ruining his health in the purſuit; Miſtaken man, ſay I, you are providing pain for yourſelf inſtead of pleaſure; <hi>you give too much for your Whiſtle.</hi>

            <head>TRUE PATRIOTISM, DISPLAYED AT THE SIEGE OF CALAIS.</head>
            <p>IN 1347, the town of Calais in France was beſieged by Edward III. of England, and reduced to the laſt extremity by famine and the fatigue of the inhabitants. John of Vienna, the governor, foreſeeing the neceſſity of ſurrendering his fortreſs, appeared upon the walls and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired a parley.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Sir Walter Manny was ſent to him by Edward, whom the governor addreſſed in the following words. "I have been entruſted by my ſovereign with the command of this town. It is almoſt a year ſince you beſieged me; and I have endeavored, as well as thoſe under me, to do my
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:026674_0057_0FD155AD4BF6C650"/>
duty. But you are acquainted with our preſent condition. We are periſhing with hunger, and have no hopes of relief. I am willing, therefore, to ſurrender; and deſire, as the ſole condition, that you would enſure the lives and liberties of theſe brave men, who have ſo long ſhared with me every danger and fatigue."</p>
            <p n="3">3. Manny replied, that the king was ſo incenſed againſt the townſmen of Calais for their obſtinate reſiſtance, he was determined to take exemplary vengeance on them; and would receive no terms which ſhould reſtrain him in the puniſhment of the offenders.</p>
            <p n="4">4. "Conſider," replied the governor, "that this is not the treatment to which brave men are entitled. If any Engliſh knight had been in my ſituation, your king would have expected the ſame conduct from him. The inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Calais have done for their ſovereign what merits the eſteem of every prince; much more, of ſo gallant a prince as Edward.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But I inform you, that, if we muſt periſh, we ſhall not periſh unrevenged; and that we are not yet ſo reduced, but we can ſell our lives at a high price to the victors. It is the intereſt of both ſides to prevent theſe deſperate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; and I expect that you yourſelf, brave knight, will interpoſe your good offices with your prince in our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half."</p>
            <p n="6">6. Manny was ſtruck with the juſtneſs of the ſentiment, and repreſented to the king the danger of repriſals, if he ſhould offer ſuch treatment to the inhabitants. Edward was at laſt perſuaded to mitigate the rigor of the conditions demanded.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He only inſiſted that ſix of the moſt reſpectable cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens ſhould be ſent to him, to be diſpoſed of as he thought proper. They were to come to his camp, carrying the keys of the city in their hands, ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>eaded and barefooted, with ropes about their necks. And on theſe conditions, he promiſed to ſpare the lives of all the remainder.</p>
            <p n="8">8. When this intelligence was conveyed to Calais, it ſtruck the inhabitants with new conſternation. To ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſix of their fellow-citizens to certain deſtruction for ſignalizing their valor in a common cauſe, appeared to them even more ſevere than that general puniſhment with which

they were before threatened; and they found themſelves incapable of coming to any reſolution in ſo cruel and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſsful a ſituation.</p>
            <p n="9">9. At laſt one of the principal inhabitants, called Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtace de St. Pierre, whoſe name deſerves to be recorded, ſtepped forth, and declared himſelf willing to encounter death for the ſafety of his friends and companions.

            <head>ANECDOTE OF MONTESQUIEU.</head>
            <p>A GENTLEMAN, being at Marſeilles, hired a boat, with an intention of ſailing for pleaſure. He entered into converſation with the two young men who owned the veſſel, and learned, that they were not water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men by trade, but ſilver-ſmiths; and that when they could be ſpared from their uſual buſineſs, they employed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in that way to increaſe their earnings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On expreſſing his ſurpriſe at their conduct, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting it to an avaricious diſpoſition; Oh! ſir, ſaid the young men, if you knew our reaſons, you would aſcribe it to a better motive.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our father, anxious to aſſiſt his family, ſcraped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all he was worth; purchaſed a veſſel for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of trading to the coaſt of Barbary; but was unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately taken by a pirate, carried to Tripoli, and ſold for a ſlave.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He writes word, that he is luckily fallen into the hands of a maſter who treats him with great humanity; but that the ſum which is demanded for his ranſom is ſo exorbitant that it will be impoſſible for him ever to raiſe it. He adds that we muſt, therefore, relinquiſh all hope of ever ſeeing him again, and be contented that he has as many comforts as his ſituation will admit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. With the hopes of reſtoring to his family a beloved father, we are ſtriving, by every honeſt mean in our power,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:026674_0061_0FD155B3D99BB5B8"/>
to collect the ſum neceſſary for his ranſom; and we are not aſhamed to employ ourſelves in the occupation of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termen. The gentleman was ſtruck with this account, and on his departure, made them a handſome preſent.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Some months afterwards, the young men being at work in their ſhop, were greatly ſurpriſed at the ſudden ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of their father, who threw himſelf into their arms; exclaiming, at the ſame time, that he was fearful they had taken ſome unjuſt method to raiſe the money for his ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, for it was too great a ſum for them to have gained by their ordinary occupation.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They profeſſed their ignorance of the whole affair, and could only ſuſpect they owed their father's releaſe to that ſtranger, to whoſe generoſity they had been before ſo much obliged. After Monteſquieu's death, an account of this affair was found among his papers, and the ſum actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally remitted to Tripoli for the old man's ranſom.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is a pleaſure to hear of ſuch an act of benevolence performed even by a perſon totally unknown to us; but the pleaſure is greatly increaſed, when it proves the union of virtue and talents in an author ſo renowned as Monteſquieu.</p>

            <head>THE BENEVOLENT PAIR.</head>
            <p>A POOR man and his wife at Vienna, who had ſix ſmall children, finding themſelves unable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port them all, were reduced to the neceſſity of turning the youngeſt upon the public. The huſband carried it reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly to the foundling hoſpital, depoſited it in the baſket which was placed near the gate for the reception of the foundlings, and anxiouſly waited till the arrival of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector, that he might take a farewel view of his child.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When the inſpector came at the uſual time to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the baſket, he perceived <hi>two</hi> children therein; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the laborer who ſtood at a ſmall diſtance, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he had brought them both; and compelled the poor man, notwithſtanding all his proteſtations to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to return with two children inſtead of one, which was already more than he knew how to maintain.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:026674_0062_0FD155B859DDCBB0"/>3. His wife, as well as himſelf, was exceedingly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected at this increaſe of their expenſes; but, unwilling to expoſe the little ſtranger in the ſtreet, they determined to uſe all their endeavors to ſupport themſelves and the ſeven children, and they hoped Providence would aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. On undreſſing the child, the woman found a paper ſowed to its clothes, containing an order upon a banker for five crowns a month, to be paid to the perſon who took care of it. The good people were not a little rejoiced at their happy fortune.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But the ſtory being circulated, and coming to the knowledge of the managers of the hoſpital, they claimed the child as their property. The laborer refuſed to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh it, and was aſſiſted by ſome perſons of diſtinction.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The cauſe being tried in a court of juſtice, it was decreed, that, as the foundling hoſpital had at firſt declined receiving the child, it of right belonged to the poor man who had ſhown ſuch humanity in keeping it, when he was ſo ill able to afford any additional expenſe.</p>

            <head>THE UNFORTUNATE PHILANTHROPIST.</head>
            <p>IN the year 1775, a ſhip lying at anchor in Table-Bay at the Cape of Good Hope, was driven on ſhore in a violent ſtorm, and the crew reduced to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt diſtreſs and danger. Their cries for aſſiſtance were diſtinctly heard by the inhabitants; but at firſt there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no proſpect of relief from any quarter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſwell of the ſea, which broke over the ſhip with the greateſt violence, made it impoſſible for them to ſave themſelves in boats, and highly dangerous to attempt it by ſwimming. Some of thoſe, who ventured to ſwim to the ſhore, were thrown againſt the rocks and daſhed to pieces; others, as ſoon as they had arrived at the ſhore, were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried back by another wave and drowned.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Dutchman by the name of VOLTEMAD, who happened to be a ſpectator of this diſtreſſing ſcene, was touched with compaſſion of ſo noble a kind, and at the ſame time ſo operative, that, mounting a high ſpirited horſe,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:026674_0063_0FD155BA4D39D570"/>
he ſwam him over to the ſhip; encouraged ſome of the crew to lay hold of the end of a rope, which he threw out to them for that purpoſe, and others to faſten themſelves to the horſe's tail; then turned about, and carried them ſafe on ſhore.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This animal's natural aptneſs for ſwimming, the great ſize of his body, the firmneſs and ſtrength of his limbs, prevented him from being eaſily overpowered by the ſwell of the ſea. But, unfortunately, this generous and active veteran himſelf became a victim to death.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fourteen young perſons he had actually ſaved; and while endeavoring to preſerve more than it was poſſible for him to do in ſo ſhort a time, he and his horſe were both drowned. The occaſion of this was as follows.</p>
            <p n="6">6. After the ſeventh turn, having ſtaid a little longer than uſual to reſt himſelf, the poor wretches on board were afraid that he did not intend to return; for this reaſon, being impatient, they redoubled their prayers and cries for aſſiſtance; upon which, his tendereſt feelings being wrought upon, he again haſtened to their relief ere his horſe was ſufficiently reſted.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The poor animal, almoſt ſpent, now ſunk the ſooner under his burden, inaſmuch as too many ſought to be ſaved at one time; and one of them, as it was thought, happened unluckily to catch hold of the horſe's bridle, and by that mean drew his head under water.</p>
            <p n="8">8. This bold and enterprizing philanthropiſt commands our eſteem and admiration the more, as he had put himſelf into this danger for the relief of others, without himſelf being able to ſwim. The Dutch Eaſt India company cauſed a monument to be erected to the memory of this unfortunate philanthropiſt.</p>

            <head>ST. PAUL'S SPEECH BEFORE KING AGRIPPA.</head>
            <p>I THINK myſelf happy, king Agrippa, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſhall anſwer for myſelf this day before thee, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the things whereof I am accuſed of the Jews;
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:026674_0064_0FD155BC1D996480"/>
eſpecially, as I know thee to be expert in all cuſtoms and queſtions which are among the Jews. Wherefore I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to hear me patiently.</p>
            <p n="2">2. My manner of life from my youth, which was at the firſt among my own nation at Jeruſalem, know all the Jews; who knew me from the beginning, if they would teſtify, that, after the ſtraiteſt ſect of our religion, I lived a Phariſee.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And now I ſtand and am judged for the hope of the promiſe made of God unto our fathers. Unto which prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe, our twelve tribes, inſtantly ſerving God day and night, hope to come; for which hope's ſake, king Agrippa, I am accuſed of the Jews.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Why ſhould it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God ſhould raiſe the dead? I verily thought with myſelf, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jeſus of Nazareth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Which thing I alſo did in Jeruſalem; and many of the ſaints did I ſhut up in priſon, having received authority from the chief prieſts. And when they were put to death, I gave my voice againſt them. And I puniſhed them oft in every ſynagogue, and compelled them to blaſpheme. And being exceedingly mad againſt them, I perſecuted them even unto ſtrange cities.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whereupon, as I went to Damaſcus with authority and commiſſion from the chief prieſts, at mid day, O king, I ſaw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightneſs of the ſun, ſhining round about me, and them who journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with me.</p>
            <p n="7">7. And, when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice ſpeaking unto me, and ſaying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me? It is hard for thee to kick againſt the pricks. And I ſaid, Who art thou Lord? And he ſaid, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But riſe, and ſtand upon thy feet; for I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a miniſter and a witneſs, both of theſe things which thou haſt ſeen, and of thoſe things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom I now ſend thee, to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of ſatan
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026674_0065_0FD155BC2479B138"/>
unto God; that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among them who are ſanctified by faith which is in me.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not diſobedient unto the heavenly viſion; but ſhowed firſt unto them of Damaſcus, and at Jeruſalem, and throughout all the coaſts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance. For theſe cauſes, the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Having, therefore, obtained help from God, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unto this day, witneſſing both to ſmall and great; ſaying no other things than thoſe which Moſes and the prophets did ſay ſhould come; that Chriſt ſhould ſuffer, and that he ſhould be the firſt who ſhould riſe from the dead, and ſhould ſhow light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.</p>

            <head>CRUELTY TO ANIMALS.</head>
            <p>MONTAIGNE thinks it ſome reflection upon human nature itſelf, that few people take delight in ſeeing beaſts careſs or play together; but almoſt every one is pleaſed to ſee them lacerate and worry one another.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am ſorry this temper is become almoſt a diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing character of our own nation, from the obſervation which is made by foreigners of our beloved paſtimes, bear-baiting, cock-fighting, and the like.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We ſhould find it hard to vindicate the deſtroying of any thing that has life, merely out of wantonneſs; yet in this principle our children are bred up; and one of the firſt pleaſures we allow them, is the licenſe of inflicting pain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on poor animals.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Almoſt as ſoon as we are ſenſible what life is our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we make it our ſport to take it from other creatures. I cannot but believe a very good uſe might be made of the fancy which children have for birds and inſects.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Mr. Locke takes notice of a mother who often procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red theſe animals for her children, but rewarded or puniſhed
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026674_0066_0FD155BE5DC01E90"/>
them as they treated them well or ill. This was no other than entering them betimes into a daily exerciſe of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, and improving their very diverſion to a virtue.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The laws of ſelf-defence undoubtedly juſtify us in deſtroying thoſe animals which would deſtroy us, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure our properties, or annoy our perſons; but not even theſe, whenever their ſituation incapacitates them from hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I know of no right which we have to ſhoot a bear on an inacceſſible iſland of ice; or an eagle on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's top; whoſe lives cannot injure, nor deaths procure us any benefit. We are unable to give life, and therefore ought not wantonly to take it away from the meaneſt inſect, without ſufficient reaſon. They all receive it from the ſame benevolent hand as ourſelves, and have therefore an equal right to enjoy it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. God has been pleaſed to create numberleſs animals intended for our ſuſtenance; and that they are ſo intended, the agreeable flavor of their fleſh to our palates, and the wholeſome nutriment which it adminiſters to our ſtomachs, are ſufficient proofs.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Theſe, as they are formed for our uſe, propagated by our culture, and fed by our care, we have certainly a right to deprive of life, becauſe it is given and preſerved to them on that condition.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But this ſhould always be performed with all the tenderneſs and compaſſion which ſo diſagreeable an office will permit; and no circumſtances ought to be omitted, which can render their executions as quick and eaſy as poſſible.</p>

            <head>SPEECH OF NICOLAUS.</head>
            <p>THE Athenians, having made war upon the Syracuſians, the army of the former, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Nicias and Demoſthenes, was totally defeated; and the generals obliged to ſurrender at diſcretion. The victors, having entered their capital in triumph, the next day a council was held to deliberate what was to be done with the priſoners.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="67" facs="unknown:026674_0067_0FD155BFDAF3CF90"/>2. Diocles, one of the leaders of the greateſt authority among the people, propoſed, that all the Athenians who were born of free parents, and all ſuch Sicilians as had join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, ſhould be impriſoned, and be maintained on bread and water only; that the ſlaves, and all the Atticks, ſhould be publickly ſold; and that the two Athenian gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erals ſhould be firſt ſcourged with rods, and then put to death.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This laſt article exceedingly diſguſted all wiſe and compaſſionate Syracuſians. Hermocrates, who was very famous for his probity and juſtice, attempted to make ſome remonſtrances to the people; but they would not hear him; and the ſhouts which echoed from all ſides prevented him from continuing his ſpeech.</p>
            <p n="4">4. At that inſtant, Nicolaus, a man venerable for his great age and gravity, who in this war had loſt two ſons, the only heirs to his name and eſtate, made his ſervants carry him to the tribunal for harangues; and the inſtant he appeared, a profound ſilence enſued, when he addreſſed them in the following manner.</p>
            <p n="5">5. "You here behold an unfortunate father, who has felt more than any other Syracuſian the fatal effects of this war, by the death of two ſons, who formed all the conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and were the only ſupports of my old age.</p>
            <p n="6">6. "I cannot, indeed, forbear admiring their patriotiſm in ſacrificing to their country's welfare a life which they would one day have been deprived of by the common courſe of nature; but then, I cannot but be ſenſibly affected with the cruel wound which their death hath made in my heart; nor forbear deteſting the Athenians, the authors of this unhappy war, as the murderers of my children.</p>
            <p n="7">7. "But, however, there is one circumſtance which I cannot conceal, that I am leſs ſenſible for my private afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than for the honor of my country, which I ſee expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to eternal infamy, by the barbarous advice which is now given you. The Athenians, I own, for declaring war ſo unjuſtly againſt us, merit the ſevereſt treatment which could be inflicted on them; but have not the Gods, the juſt aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of wrongs, ſufficiently puniſhed them and avenged us?</p>
            <p n="8">8. "When their generals laid down their arms and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered, did not they do this in hopes of having their lives
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026674_0068_0FD155C21F08A420"/>
ſpared? And will it be poſſible for us, if we put them to death, to avoid the juſt reproach of having violated the law of nations, and diſhonored our victory by unheard of cruelty!</p>
            <p n="9">9. "What, will you ſuffer your glory to be thus ſullied in the face of the whole world? And will you hear it ſaid that a nation, who firſt dedicated a temple to clemency, had found none in Syracuſe? Surely, victories and tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs do not give immortal glory to a city; but the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſing of mercy towards a vanquiſhed enemy, moderation in the greateſt proſperity, and the fearing to offend the Gods by a haughty and inſolent pride, are glories far more permanent than the moſt ſplendid conqueſts.</p>
            <p n="10">10. "You doubtleſs have not forgotten, that this Nicias, whoſe fate you are going to pronounce, was the very man who pleaded your cauſe in the aſſembly of the Athenians, and who employed all his credit, and the whole power of his eloquence, to diſſuade his country from embarking in this war.</p>
            <p n="11">11. "Should you therefore pronounce ſentence of death on this worthy general, would it be a juſt reward for the zeal he ſhowed for your intereſt?

Eat this, ſaid the Moor, giving him half a peach; you now know that you may confide in my protection.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He then locked him up in his garden apartments, telling him as ſoon as it was night, he would provide for his
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:026674_0069_0FD155C3171F1910"/>
eſcape to a place of greater ſafety. The Moor then went into his houſe, where he had but juſt ſeated himſelf, when a great crowd, with loud lamentations, came to his gate, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the corpſe of his ſon, who had juſt been killed by a Spaniard.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the firſt ſhock of ſurpriſe was a little over, he learned from the deſcription given, that the fatal deed was done by the very perſon then in his power. He mentioned this to no one; but, as ſoon as it was dark, retired to his garden, as if to grieve alone, giving orders that none ſhould follow him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Then accoſting the Spaniard, he ſaid, Chriſtian, the perſon you have killed is my ſon; his body is now in my houſe. You ought to ſuffer; but you have eaten with me, and I have given you my faith, which muſt not be broken.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He then led the aſtoniſhed Spaniard to his ſtables, and mounted him on one of his fleeteſt horſes, and ſaid, Fly far, while the night can cover you; you will be ſafe in the morning. You are indeed guilty of my ſon's blood; but God is juſt and good, and I thank Him I am innocent of yours, and that my faith given is preſerved.</p>
            <p n="7">7. This point of honor is moſt religiouſly obſerved by the Arabs and Saracens, from whom it was adopted by the Moors of Africa, and by them was brought into Spain; the effects of which remain to this day; ſo that when there is any fear of a war's breaking out between England and Spain, an Engliſh merchant there, who apprehends the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcation of his goods as thoſe of an enemy, thinks them ſafe if he can get a Spaniard to take charge of them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The Spaniard ſecures them as his own, and faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly re-delivers them, or pays the value, whenever the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhman demands them. One inſtance of Spaniſh honor cannot but ſtill be freſh in the memory of many now liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and deſerves to be handed down to the lateſt poſterity.</p>
            <p n="9">9. In the year 1746, when the Engliſh were at open war with Spain, the Elizabeth of London, captain William Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, coming through the gulph from Jamaica, richly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, met with a moſt violent ſtorm, in which the ſhip ſprung a leak, that obliged them, for the ſaving of their lives, to run into the Havannah, a Spaniſh port.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:026674_0070_0FD155C65B2A73D8"/>10. The captain went on ſhore, and directly waited on the governor, told the occaſion of his putting in, and that he ſurrendered the ſhip as a prize, and himſelf and his men as priſoners of war, only requeſting good quarter.</p>
            <p n="11">11. No, Sir, replied the Spaniſh governor, if we had taken you in fair war at ſea, or approaching our coaſt with hoſtile intentions, your ſhip would then have been a prize, and your people priſoners; but when, diſtreſſed by a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt, you come into our ports for the ſafety of your lives, we the enemies, being men, are bound as ſuch by the laws of humanity to afford relief to diſtreſſed men who aſk it of us.</p>
            <p n="12">12. We cannot, even againſt our enemies, take advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of an act of God. You have leave therefore to unload your ſhip, if that be neceſſary to ſtop the leak; you may refit her here, and traffic ſo far as ſhall be neceſſary to pay the charges; you may then depart, and I will give you a paſs to be in force till you are beyond Bermuda.</p>
            <p n="13">13. If after that you are taken, you will then be a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prize; but now you are only a ſtranger, and have a ſtranger's right to ſafety and protection. The ſhip accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly departed, and arrived ſafe in London.</p>

            <head>ADVICE TO A YOUNG TRADESMAN.</head>
            <p>REMEMBER that time is money. He who can earn ten ſhillings a day by his labor, and goes abroad, or ſits idle one half of that day, though he ſpend but ſixpence during his diverſion or idleneſs, ought not to reckon <hi>that</hi> the only expenſe; he has really ſpent, or rather thrown away, five ſhillings beſides.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Remember that credit is money. If a man lets his money lie in my hands after it is due, he gives me the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or ſo much as I can make of it during that time. This amounts to a conſiderable ſum where a man has good and large credit, and makes good uſe of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Remember that money is of a prolific, generating nature. Money can beget money, and its offspring can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get more, and ſo on. Five ſhillings turned is ſix; turned again, it is ſeven and three-pence; and ſo on till it becomes a hundred pounds. The more there is of it, the more it produces every turning, ſo that the profits riſe quicker and quicker.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Remember that ſix pounds a year is but a groat a day. For this little ſum (which may be daily waſted ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in time or expenſe, unperceived) a man of credit may, on his own ſecurity, have the conſtant poſſeſſion and uſe of a hundred pounds. So much in ſtock, briſkly turned by an induſtrious man, produces great advantage.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Remember this ſaying, "The good paymaſter is lord of another man's purſe." He who is known to pay punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually and exactly at the time he promiſes, may at any time, and on any occaſion, raiſe all the money his friends can ſpare. This is ſometimes of great uſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. After induſtry and frugality, nothing contributes more to the raiſing of a young man in the world, than punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality and juſtice in all his dealings; therefore never keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time you promiſed, leſt a diſappointment ſhut up your friend's purſe forever.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The moſt trifling actions which affect a man's credit are to be regarded. The ſound of your hammer at five in the morning, or nine at night, heard by a creditor, makes him eaſy ſix months longer.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:026674_0073_0FD155CE78B380C0"/>8. But if he ſees you at a billiard table, or hears your voice at a tavern, when you ſhould be at work, he ſends for his money the n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t day; demands it before he can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in a lump.</p>
            <p n="9">9. It ſhows, beſides, that you are mindful of what you owe; it makes you appear a careful, as well as an honeſt man, and that ſtill increaſes your credit.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Beware of thinking all your own that you poſſeſs, and of living accordingly. It is a miſtake that many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who have credit fall into. To prevent this, keep an exact account, for ſome time, both of your expenſes and your income.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If you take the pains at firſt to mention particulars, it will have this good effect; you will diſcover how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, ſmall, trifling expenſes mount up to large ſums, and will diſcern what might have been, and may for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture be ſaved, without occaſioning any great inconvenience.</p>
            <p n="12">12. In ſhort, the way to wealth, if you deſire it, is as plain as the way to market. It depends chiefly on two words, <hi>induſtry</hi> and <hi>frugality;</hi> that is, waſte neither time nor money, but make the beſt uſe of both. Without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and frugality, nothing will do, and with them, every thing will do.</p>
            <p n="13">13. He, who gets all he can honeſtly, and ſaves all he gets (neceſſary expenſes excepted) will certainly become <hi>rich</hi>; if that Being, who governs the world, to whom all ſhould look for a bleſſing on their honeſt endeavors, doth not, in his wiſe providence, otherwiſe determine.</p>

            <head>PARENTAL AFFECTION. STORY OF THE BEAR.</head>
            <p>THE white bear of Greenland and Spitſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bergen is conſiderably larger than the brown bear of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, or the black bear of America. This bear is often ſeen on floats of ice, ſeveral leagues at ſea. The follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is copied from the journal of a voyage, for making diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries towards the North Pole.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="74" facs="unknown:026674_0074_0FD155CF9EF27470"/>2. Early in the morning, the man at the maſt-head, gave notice that three bears were making their way very faſt over the ice, and directing their courſe towards the ſhip. They had probably been invited by the blubber of a ſea horſe, which the men had ſet on fire, and which was burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ice at the time of their approach.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They proved to be a ſhe bear and her two cubs; but the cubs were nearly as large as the dam. They ran eagerly to the fire, and drew out from the flames part of the fleſh of the ſea horſe, which remained unconſumed, and ate it voraciouſly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The crew from the ſhip threw great pieces of the fleſh, which they had ſtill left, upon the ice, which the old bear carried away ſingly, laid every piece before her cubs; and, dividing them, gave each a ſhare, reſerving but a ſmall portion to herſelf. As ſhe was carrying away the laſt piece, they levelled their muſkets at the cubs, and ſhot them both dead; and in her retreat, they wounded the dam, but not mortally.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It would have drawn tears of pity from any but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling minds, to have marked the affectionate concern man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſted by this poor beaſt, in the moments of her expiring young. Though ſhe was ſorely wounded, and could but juſt crawl to the place where they lay, ſhe carried the lump of fleſh ſhe had fetched away, as ſhe had done the others before, tore it in pieces, and laid it down before them; and when ſhe ſaw they refuſed to eat, ſhe laid her paws firſt upon one, and then upon the other, and endeavored to raiſe them up.</p>
            <p n="6">6. All this while it was piteous to hear her moan. When ſhe found ſhe could not ſtir them, ſhe went off; and when at ſome diſtance, looked back and moaned; and that not availing to entice them away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe returned, and ſmelling around them, began to lick their wounds.</p>
            <p n="7">7. She went off a ſecond time, as before; and having crawled a few paces, looked again behind her, and for ſome time ſtood moaning. But ſtill her cubs not riſing to follow her, ſhe returned to them again, and with ſigns of inexpreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible fondneſs, went round one, and round the other, paw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and moaning.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Finding at laſt that they were cold and lifeleſs, ſhe raiſed her head towards the ſhip, and growled her reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:026674_0075_0FD155D1342A7248"/>
at the murderers; which they returned with a volley of muſket balls. She fell between her cubs, and died lick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their wounds.</p>
            <p n="9">9. What child can read this intereſting ſtory, and not feel in his heart the warmeſt emotions of gratitude, for the ſtronger and more permanent tenderneſs he has experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced from his parents; while, at the ſame time, he feels his diſpleaſure ariſing towards thoſe who treat with wanton barbarity any of the brute creation?</p>

            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Chactaws,</hi> the moſt numerous and the moſt war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like tribe on the continent, immediately flew to arms. They ſent deputies to New-Orleans to demand from the French governor the head of the ſavage who had fled to him for protection.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The governor offered preſents as an atonement, but they were rejected with diſdain; and they threatened to exterminate the whole tribe of the <hi>Collapiſſas.</hi> To pacify this fierce nation, and prevent the effuſion of blood, it was at length found neceſſary to deliver up the unhappy Indian.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Sieur Ferrand, commander of the German poſts, on the right of the Miſſiſippi, was charged with this mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy commiſſion. A rendezvous was, in conſequence, appointed between the ſettlement of the <hi>Collapiſſas</hi> and the German poſts, where the mournful ceremony was conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the following manner.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:026674_0076_0FD155D2DCDF0590"/>6. The Indian victim, whoſe name was <hi>Mingo,</hi> was produced. He roſe up, and, agreeably to the cuſtom of the people, harangued the aſſembly to the following purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. "I am a true man; that is to ſay, I fear not death; but I lament the fate of my wife and four infant children, whom I leave behind in a very tender age. I lament too my father and my mother, whom I have long maintained by hunting. Them, however, I recommend to the French, ſince, on their account, I now fall a ſacrifice."</p>
            <p n="8">8. Scarce had he finiſhed this ſhort and pathetic ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, when the old father, ſtruck with the filial affection of his ſon, aroſe, and thus addreſſed himſelf to his audience.</p>
            <p n="9">9. "My ſon is doomed to death; but he is young and vigorous, and more capable than I, to ſupport his mother, his wife, and four infant children. It is neceſſary, then, that he remain upon the earth to protect and provide for them. As for me who draw towards the end of my career, I have lived long enough. May my ſon attain to my age, that he may bring up my tender infants. I am no longer good for any thing; a few years more or leſs are to me of ſmall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. I have lived as a man. I will die as a man. I therefore take the place of my ſon."</p>
            <p n="10">10. At theſe words, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He embraced them for the laſt time, exhorted them to be ever faithful to the French, and to die rather than betray them by any mean treachery, unworthy of his blood. "My death," concluded he, "I conſider neceſſary for the ſafety of the nation, and I glory in the ſacrifice."</p>
            <p n="11">11. Having thus delivered himſelf, he preſented his head to the kinſman of the deceaſed <hi>Chactaw;</hi> and they accepted it. He then extended himſelf over the trunk of a tree, when, with a hatchet, they ſevered his head from his body.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The French, who aſſiſted at this tragedy, could not contain their tears, whilſt they admired the heroic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of this venerable old man; whoſe reſolution bore a reſemblance to that of the celebrated Roman orator, who, in the time of the triumvirate, was concealed by his ſon.</p>

            <p n="14">14. The ſon conjured them to take <hi>his</hi> life, and ſpare the age of his father; but the ſoldiers, more barbarous than the ſavages, butchered them both on the ſpot.</p>

            <head>THE ART OF PLEASING.</head>
            <p>I HAVE often lamented, that they, who have taken the moſt pains to recommend an attention to the art of pleaſing, have urged it only on the mean mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of ſelf-intereſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In order to attain the power of pleaſing, they have recommended flattery and deceit; and though they have required in their pupils the appearances of many good qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, they have not inſiſted on any ſubſtantial or conſiſtent virtue.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is my wiſh to exalt this amiable talent of pleaſing to the rank of a virtue founded on principle, and on the beſt diſpoſitions of human nature. I would ſeparate it from thoſe varniſhed qualities, which, like whited ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chres, are but a diſguiſe for internal deformity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A ſtudent of the art of pleaſing, as it is taught in the ſchool of faſhion, is all ſoftneſs and plauſibility, all benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and generoſity, all attention and aſſiduity, all graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and gentility. Such is the external appearance; but compare it with his private life, with thoſe actions which paſs unſeen, and you will find it by no means correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
            <p n="5">5. You will uſually find a hard heart, meanneſs, ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, avarice, and a total want of thoſe principles from which alone true benevolence, ſincere friendſhip, and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs of diſpoſition can originate. You will, indeed, find even the appearances of friendſhip and benevolence propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the ſuppoſed riches and rank of him whoſe favor and patronage are cultivated.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="78" facs="unknown:026674_0078_0FD155D5994A3E40"/>6. It is a favorite maxim with thoſe who teach the art of pleaſing, that if you deſire to pleaſe, you can ſcarcely fail to pleaſe. But what motive, according to their doctrine, is to excite this deſire? A wiſh to render all with whom you converſe ſubſervient to your intereſted purpoſes of ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice or ambition.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is a mean and deſpicable motive, when made the ſole and conſtant principle of converſation and behavior. If this life is the whole of our exiſtence; if riches and civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il honors, are the chief good; if truth, honor, and generoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, are but names to adorn declamation; then, indeed, they who practiſe the art of pleaſing, according to the vulgar idea of it, are, after all, the truly, and the only wiſe.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But let us not think ſo meanly of the world and its Creator; and if our favorable opinion of things be an error, it is not only pardonable but glorious; and a generous man will ſay, like the noble ancient, he had rather err with a Socrates and a Plato, than be right with a Machiavel.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But, indeed, the virtues and the graces are much nearer allied, than they who are ſtrangers to the virtues are willing to acknowledge. There is ſomething extremely beautiful in all the moral virtues, clearly underſtood and properly reduced to practice.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Religion is alſo declared to be full of pleaſantneſs, in that volume in which its nature is deſcribed with the greateſt authenticity. It muſt indeed be allowed, that he who is actuated in his deſire of pleaſing by morality and religion, may very properly add all the embelliſhments of external gracefulneſs; and he may reſt aſſured, that the ſincerity of his principles, and the goodneſs of his character, will inſure a degree of ſucceſs in his attempts to pleaſe, which a falſe pretender, with all his duplicity, can never obtain.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If true politeneſs conſiſts in yielding ſome of our own pretenſions to the ſelf-love of others, in repreſſing our pride and arrogance, and in a gentleneſs of ſentiment and conduct, ſurely nothing can be more conducive to it than a religion which every where recommends brotherly love, meekneſs, and humility.</p>
            <p n="12">12. I know not how paradoxical my opinion might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to the faſhionable clubs at St. James', or to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:026674_0079_0FD155DAF0D04EB0"/>
men of the world, or to the proficient in what I call the <hi>inſincere</hi> art of pleaſing; but I cannot help thinking, that a true Chriſtian, one who thinks and acts, as far as the infirmity of his nature will permit, conſiſtently with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his religion, poſſeſſes qualities more capable of pleaſing, than any of thoſe which are ſaid ſo eminently to have diſtinguiſhed a Marlborough and a Bollingbroke.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The pious and amiable Mr. N— ſeems to me to have deſerved the epithet of all-accompliſhed, much better than he to whom it has been ſo often applied; and if we may judge of his writings, and the accounts given of his life, as on the one hand, there never was a better Chriſtian, ſo, on the other, there never appeared a more polite gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman.</p>
            <p n="14">14. It is evident he derived his art of pleaſing, not from a ſtudy of the world, or practiſing the tricks of the littl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> worldling, but from the lovely qualities recommended in the goſpel, and from an imitation of the humble Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="15">15. They who ſtudy the art of pleaſing would perhaps ſmile, were an inſtructor to refer them, for the beſt rules which have ever been given, to the ſermon on the mount.</p>
            <p n="16">16. It is however certain, that the art of pleaſing, which is founded on ſincere principles, derived from reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and morality, is as far ſuperior to that falſe art, which conſiſts only in ſimulation and diſſimulation, as the fine bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liancy of the real diamond excels the luſtre of French paſte; or as the roſeate hue on the cheek of Hebe, the painted viſage of a haggard courte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>an.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The inſincere art of pleaſing reſembles the inferior ſpecies of timber in a building, which, in order to pleaſe the eye, requires the aſſiſtance of paint: but the art which is founded on ſincerity, is more like that which diſplays far greater beauty in the variety and richneſs of its own native veins and color.</p>
            <p n="18">18. A ſhort time, or a ſlight touch, deſtroys the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial beauty of the one; while the other acquires new graces from the hand of time.</p>
            <p n="19">19. The rules and doctrines of religion and morality tend to correct all the malignant qualities of the heart; ſuch as envy, malice, pride, and reſentment. In doing this, they cut off the very ſource of diſagreeable behavior.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb n="80" facs="unknown:026674_0080_0FD155DCDB577360"/>20. Morality and religion inculcate whatever is juſt, mild, moderate, candid, and benevolent. In doing this, they effectually promote a ſyſtem of manners, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſiniſter deſign in the perſon who poſſeſſes them, cannot fail of being agreeable.</p>
            <p n="21">21. If to theſe ſubſtantial powers of pleaſing are added the laſt poliſh of a graceful deportment, the habits acquired in good company, an acquaintance with men and manners, a taſte for polite arts and polite books, no other requiſites will be wanting to perfect the art, and form an all-accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed character.</p>
            <p n="22">22. A man will not be under the neceſſity of hurting his conſcience and reputation in cultivating, I know not what, of a deceitful and affected behavior. He may be at once pleaſing and reſpectable, and grow in favor with men, without offending God.</p>

            <p>AMONG the ſeveral virtues of Ariſtides, that for which he was moſt renowned was juſtice; becauſe this virtue is of moſt general uſe, its benefits extending to a greater number of perſons, as it is the foundation, and in a manner the ſoul, of every public office and employment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Themiſtocles having conceived the deſign of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planting the Lacedemonians, and of taking the government of Greece out of their hands, in order to put it into thoſe of the Athenians, kept his eye and his thoughts continually fixed upon that great project; and as he was not very nice or ſcrupulous in the choice of his meaſures, whatever tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards accompliſhing the end he had in view, he look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as juſt and lawful.</p>
            <p n="3">3. On a certain day he declared in a full aſſembly of the people, that he had a very important deſign to propoſe; but that he could not communicate it to the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe its ſucceſs required it ſhould be carried on with the greateſt ſecreſy; he therefore deſired they would appoint a perſon to whom he might explain himſelf upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in queſtion.</p>

               <pb n="81" facs="unknown:026674_0081_0FD155DE1DCE7670"/>4. Ariſtides was unanimouſly fixed upon by the whole aſſembly, who referred themſelves entirely to his opinion of the affair; ſo great a confidence had they both in his prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and prudence.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Themiſtocles, therefore, having taken him aſide, told him the deſign which he had conceived was to burn the fleet belonging to the reſt of the Grecian ſtates, which then lay in a neighboring port; and by this mean Athens would certainly become miſtreſs of all Greece.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Ariſtides hereupon returned to the aſſembly, and only declared to them, that indeed nothing could be more advantageous to the commonwealth than Themiſtocles' project; but at the ſame time, nothing in the world could be more unjuſt. All the people unanimouſly ordained that Themiſtocles ſhould entirely deſiſt from his project.</p>

            <head>SPEECH OF MR. PITT IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT, ON THE SUBJECT OF THE SLAVE TRADE.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WHILE I regret the ill ſucceſs which has hitherto attended my efforts on this ſubject, I am conſoled with the thought that the houſe has now come to a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion declarative of the infamy of the ſlave trade.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The only queſtion now is, on the continuance of this traffic, a traffic of which the very thought is beyond all human endurance; a traffic which even its friends think ſo intolerable that it ought to be cruſhed. Yet the abolition of it is to be reſolved into a queſtion of expediency.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Its advocates, in order to continue it, have deſerted even the principles of commerce; ſo that, it ſeems, a traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic in the liberty, the blood, the life of human beings, is not to have the advantages of the common rules of arithmetic, which govern all other commercial dealings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The point now in diſpute is the continuance for one year. As to thoſe who are concerned in this trade, a year will not be of any conſequence; but will it be of none to the unhappy ſlaves? It is true, that in the courſe of commer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial concerns in general, it is ſaid ſometimes to be beneath the magnanimity of a man of honor to inſiſt on a ſcrupulous exactneſs, in his own favor, upon a diſputed item in accounts.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But does it make any part of our magnanimity to be exact in our own favor in the traffic of human blood? If I could feel that any calculation upon the ſubject were to be made in this way, the ſide on which I ſhould determine, would be in favor of the unhappy ſufferers; not of thoſe who oppreſſed them.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:026674_0085_0FD155E5F1357D08"/>6. But this one year is only to ſhow the planters that Parliament is willing to be liberal to them! Sir, I do not underſtand complimenting away the lives of ſo many hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings. I do not comprehend the principle on which a few individuals are to be complimented, and their minds ſet at reſt, at the expenſe and total ſacrifice of the intereſt, the ſecurity, the happineſs of a whole quarter of this world, which, from our foul practices, has, for a vaſt length of time, been a ſcene of miſery and horror.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I ſay, becauſe I feel, that in continuing this trade, you are guilty of an offence beyond your power to a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>one for; and by your indulgence to the planters, thouſands of human beings are to be conſigned to miſery.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Every year in which you continue this trade, you add thouſands to the catalogue of miſery, which, if you could behold in a ſingle inſtance, you would revolt with horror from the ſcene; but the ſize of the miſery prevents you from beholding it. Five hundred out of one thouſand who are obtained in this traffic periſh in this ſcene of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; and are brought miſerable victims to their graves.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The remaining part of this wretched group are taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in body and mind, covered with diſeaſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, carrying with them the ſeeds of peſtilence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection to your iſlands.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Let me then aſk the houſe, whether they can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive any advantage from theſe doubtful effects of a calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation on the continuance of the traffic: and whether two years will not be better than three for its continuance?</p>
            <p n="11">11. For my part, I feel the infamy of the trade ſo heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily, the impolicy of it ſo clearly, that I am aſhamed not to have been able to have convinced the houſe to abandon it altogether at an inſtant; to pronounce with one voice the immediate and total abolition. There is no excuſe for us. It is the very death of juſtice to utter a ſyllable in ſupport of it.</p>
            <p n="12">12. I know, Sir, I ſtate this ſubject with warmth. I feel it is impoſſible for me not to do ſo; or if it were, I ſhould deteſt myſelf for the exerciſe of moderation. I cannot, without ſuffering every feeling and every paſſion that ought to riſe in the cauſe of humanity to ſleep within me, ſpeak coolly upon ſuch a ſubject.

            <p n="13">13. In ſhort, unleſs I have miſunderſtood the ſubject, and unleſs ſome reaſons ſhould be offered, much ſuperior to any I have yet heard, I ſhall think it the moſt ſingular act that ever was done by a deliberative aſſembly, to refuſe to aſſent to the propoſed amendment. It has been by a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution declared to be the firſt object of their deſire, the firſt object of their duty, and the firſt object of their inclination.</p>

            <head>THE HUMANE INDIAN.</head>
            <p>AN Indian, who had not met with his uſual ſucceſs in hunting, wandered down to a plantation among the back ſettlements in Virginia; and ſeeing a plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at his door, aſked for a morſel of bread, for he was very hungry. The planter bid him begone, for he would give him none.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Will you give me a cup of your beer? ſaid the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian. No, you ſhall have none here, replied the planter. But I am very faint, ſaid the ſavage. Will you give me only a draught of cold water? Get you gone, you Indian dog; you ſhall have nothing here, ſaid the planter.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It happened ſome months after, that the planter went on a ſhooting party up into the woods, where, intent upon his game, he miſſed his company, and loſt his way; and night coming on, he wandered through the foreſt, till he eſpied an Indian wigwam.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He approached the ſavage's habitation, and aſked him to ſhow him the way to a plantation on that ſide the country. It is too late for you to go there this evening, Sir, ſaid the Indian; but if you will accept of my homely fare, you are welcome.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He then offered him ſome veniſon, and ſuch other refreſhment as his ſtore afforded, and having laid ſome bearſkins for his bed, he deſired that he would repoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:026674_0089_0FD155F1678E6F30"/>
for the night, and he would awake him early in the morning, and conduct him on his way.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Accordingly in the morning they ſet off, and the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian led him out of the foreſt, and put him into the road which he was to purſue; but juſt as they were taking leave, he ſtepped before the planter, and turning round, ſtaring full in his face, aſked him, whether he recollected his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The planter was now ſtruck with ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, when he recogniſed in his kind protector, the Indian whom he had ſo harſhly treated.</p>
            <p n="7">7. He confeſſed that he knew him, and was full of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes for his brutal behavior; to which the Indian only replied; When you ſee poor Indians fainting for a cup of cold water, don't ſay again, "Get you gone, you Indian dog." The Indian then wiſhed him well on his journey, and left him. It is not difficult to ſay which of theſe two had the beſt claim to the name of Chriſtian.</p>

            <head>THE MAMMOTH.</head>
            <p>OF all the quadrupeds which have hitherto been deſcribed, the Mammoth is undoubtedly much the largeſt. This animal is not known to have an exiſtence any where at preſent. We judge of it only from its bones and ſkeletons, which are of an unparalleled ſize, and are found in Siberia, Ruſſia, Germany, and North-America.</p>
            <p n="2">2. On the Ohio, and in many places farther north, tuſks, grinders, and ſkeletons, which admit of no compariſon with any other animal at preſent known, are found in vaſt numbers; ſome lying on the ſurface of the earth, and ſome a little below it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A Mr. Stanley, taken priſoner by the Indians near the mouth of the Teneſee, relates, that, after being tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from one tribe to another, he was at length carried over the mountains weſt of the Miſſouri to a river which runs weſtwardly; that theſe bones abounded there; and that the natives ſaid the animal was ſtill exiſting in the northern parts of their country.</p>

A delegation of warriors from the Delaware tribe having viſited the governor of Virginia, during the late revolution, on matters of buſineſs; after theſe had been diſcuſſed and ſettled in council, the governor aſked them ſome queſtions relative to their country, and, among others, what they knew or had heard of the animal whoſe bones were found at the ſaltlicks on the Ohio.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The chief ſpeaker immediately put himſelf into an attitude of oratory, and with a pomp ſuited to what he conceived the elevation of his ſubject, informed him, that it was a tradition handed down from their fathers, "That in ancient times, a herd of theſe tremendous animals came to the Big-bonelicks, and began a univerſal deſtruction of the bears, deer, elks, buffaloes, and other animals, which had been created for the uſe of the Indians."</p>
            <p n="6">6. "That the Great Man above, looking down and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, was ſo enraged that he ſeized his lightning, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to the earth, ſeated himſelf on a neighboring mountain, on a rock, on which his ſeat and the print of his feet are ſtill to be ſeen, and hurled his bolts among them, till the whole were ſlaughtered, except the big bull, who, preſenting his forehead to the ſhafts, ſhook them off as they fell; but miſſing one at length, it wounded him in the ſide; whereon, ſpringing round, he bounded over the Wabaſh, the Illinois, and finally over the great lakes, where he is living at this day."</p>

               <p>Pray what are the mighty advantages of educating children in what you ſtyle a uſeful manner? I never yet ſaw them.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Fr.</speaker>
               <p>Then you are no very ſtrict obſerver. (I beg your pardon for ſpeaking thus freely.) But ſurely each day brings inſtances of its advantages; and each day ſhows the miſchief of a contrary mode. The kind of education I mention is that which tends to give females well regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated minds and agreeable manners; and render them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, eſteemed, and admired. For it is by no means neceſſary in order to this, that a young lady ſhould be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of all polite accompliſhments. They often belong to ſome of the moſt diſguſting and inſignificant of the ſex. No, let parents form the growing mind to virtue, religion, and the calm pleaſures of domeſtic life, at the ſame time

endeavoring that cheerfulneſs play round the heart, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent gaiety enliven the behavior. Let the habit of ſelf-government be early produced; for all the world conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring cannot make a woman happy who does not govern her paſſions. Let the firſt appearance of ſtubbornneſs in them be checked and reſiſted; and let them be taught cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to deny themſelves every object of deſire, inconſiſtent with <hi>reaſon, prudence,</hi> or <hi>virtue.</hi> Thus cultured, their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers will be ſweet and placid, and their manners gentle and engaging. If they be put under the care of tutors abroad; they will not be unteachable and refractory; and the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of their parents will not be neceſſary to make them behave with diſcretion and propriety.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Care.</speaker>
               <p>Well, after their minds are thus taken care of, how would you have them further accompliſhed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Fr.</speaker>
               <p>They ſhould be well verſed in reading, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, arithmetic, and Engliſh grammar. If their natural genius ſtrongly led them to poetry, painting, or muſic, and eaſy fortune admitted, it ſhould be indulged and cultivated; but by no means to ſuch a degree as to interrupt or ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſede domeſtic employments. For theſe require attention in a greater or leſs degree from every woman; and unleſs ſhe underſtand and diſcharge them according to her circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, ſhe is contemptible and uſeleſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Care.</speaker>
               <p>Fine accompliſhments, truly! a perfect ſkill in handling the broom and duſter! Mrs. Friendly, if you educate your children in this way, they will be ruined; they will be ſtrangers to the charms of dancing, dreſs and company. The graces will never condeſcend to adorn thoſe who are accuſtomed to the kitchen.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Fr.</speaker>
               <p>My friend, I have no objection to dancing, dreſs and company, when they form not the chief object of ſolicitude and attention, and are cultivated merely as the recreation and ornaments of life, and not as the buſineſs and end of it. Be aſſured, a well furniſhed mind, a well gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned temper, love of domeſtic pleaſures, and an inclination and capacity to purſue domeſtic employments, are the firſt requiſites in a woman, and the foundation of her reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and enjoyment. Without theſe, though her graceful mien and dancing charm every eye, and her muſic be ſweeter than the harp of Gabriel, ſhe muſt be unhappy in
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:026674_0093_0FD155FC18E87ED0"/>
herſelf, and a vexation and torment to her friends. Let us view a perſon educated in the ſchool of diſſipation, and furniſhed with merely polite accompliſhments. Engroſſed by the deſire of leading a life of amuſement before ſhe can even ſpell a ſentence, and unfurniſhed with juſt ſentiments and induſtrious habits, ſhe is ſent to the dancing academy that her manners may become graceful. Here ſhe ſees gayer dreſſes than her own, which inflame with vanity and envy her giddy, unoccupied mind. She is determined to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> outdone by none in elegance. She diſputes with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma about faſhion and fine clothes; and if her extravagant deſires are not indulged, murmurs and repines at her cruel fate; becomes confirmed in the deteſtable habit of fretting; and knows not content but by the name. A fondneſs for thoſe phantoms, which lure to ruin, called pleaſures, and a paſſion for ſhow and parade, which perhaps through life ſhe can never indulge, gain entire poſſeſſion of her heart. All her joys are in gay parties and aſſemblies, where, like the butterfly of ſummer, ſhe pleaſes by the brilliance of her colors only; which, however, is no ſooner familiar to the eye, than it is beheld with indifference; yet alas! this is all the attraction which this child of vanity can boaſt. Maturer years ſteal on; her mind is ſo uncultivated that ſhe is incapable of the rational pleaſures of thinking and converſation; her love of diſſipation and amuſement grows with her growth; ſhe ſighs for new pleaſures; but alas! ſhe has ſo often travelled the circle, that their novelty is deſtroyed. With all her apparent gaiety, ſhe is probably more wretched than the miſcreant, who begs the morſel that ſuſtains his being. If ſhe be ever placed at the head of a family, ſhe diſguſts her huſband, neglects her children, and order, peace and induſtry are ſtrangers in her houſe. Her company is ever unintereſting or diſagreeable, her name is ſynonimous with folly, and her memory is loſt with her life.</p>

It ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures her honor and happineſs through life, whatever be her ſtation; and it leads her to the exerciſe of thoſe noble and virtuous diſpoſitions which are an indiſpenſable prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the enjoyments of the future ſtate.</p>

            <head>SINGULAR ADVENTURE OF GENERAL PUTNAM.</head>
            <p>WHEN General Putnam firſt moved to Pomfret, in Connecticut, in the year 1739, the country was new and much infeſted with wolves. Great havoc was made among the ſheep by a ſhe-wolf, which, with her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual whelps, had for ſeveral years continued in that vicinity. The young ones were commonly deſtroyed by the vigilance of the hunters; but the old one was too ſagacious to be enſnared by them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This wolf, at length, became ſuch an intolerable nuiſance, that Mr. Putnam entered into a combination with five of his neighbors to hunt alternately until they could deſtroy her. Two, by rotation, were to be conſtantly in purſuit. It was known, that, having loſt the toes from one foot, by a ſteel trap, ſhe made one track ſhorter than the other.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By this veſtige, the purſuers recognized, in a light ſnow, the route of this pernicious animal. Having follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to Connecticut river, and found ſhe had turned back in a direct courſe towards Pomfret, they immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and by ten o'clock the next morning the blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hounds had driven her into a den, about three miles diſtant from the houſe of Mr. Putnam.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The people ſoon collected with dogs, guns, ſtraw, fire and ſulphur, to attack the common enemy. With this apparatus, ſeveral unſucceſsful efforts were made to force her from the den. The hounds came back badly wounded, and refuſed to return. The ſmoke of blazing ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>w had no effect. Nor did the fumes of burnt brimſtone, with which the cavern was filled, compel her to quit the retirement.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:026674_0095_0FD15600320CC650"/>5. Wearied with ſuch fruitleſs attempts (which had brought the time to ten o'clock at night) Mr. Putnam tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed once more to make his dog enter, but in vain; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to his negro man to go down into the cavern and ſhoot the wolf. The negro declined the hazardous ſervice.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Then it was that their maſter, angry at the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and declaring that he was aſhamed of having a coward in his family, reſolved himſelf to deſtroy the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious beaſt, leſt ſhe ſhould eſcape through ſome unknown fiſſure of the rock.</p>
            <p n="7">7. His neighbors ſtrongly remonſtrated againſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilous enterprize; but he, knowing that wild animals were intimidated by fire, and having provided ſeveral ſtrips of birch bark, the only combuſtible material which he could obtain, which would afford light in this deep and darkſome cave, prepared for his deſcent.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Having, accordingly, diveſted himſelf of his coat and waiſtcoat, and having a long rope faſtened round his l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, by which he might be pulled back, at a concerted ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, he entered, head foremoſt, with the blazing torch in his hand.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Having groped his paſſage till he came to a hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal part of the den, the moſt terrifying darkneſs appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in front of the dim circle of light afforded by his torch. It was ſilent as the houſe of death. None but monſters of the deſart had ever before explored this ſolitary manſion of horror.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He cautiouſly proceeding onward, came to an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; which he ſlowly mounted on his hands and knees until he diſcovered the glaring eyeballs of the wolf, who was ſitting at the extremity of the cavern. Startled at the ſight of fire, ſhe gnaſhed her teeth and gave a ſullen growl.</p>
            <p n="11">11. As ſoon as he had made the neceſſary diſcovery, he kicked the rope as a ſignal for pulling him out. The people, at the mouth of the den, who had liſtened with painful anxiety, hearing the growling of the wolf, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing their friend to be in the moſt imminent danger, drew him forth with ſuch celerity that he was ſtripped of his clothes, and ſeverely bruiſed.</p>
            <p n="12">12. After he had adjuſted his clothes, and loaded his gun with nine buck ſhot, holding a torch in one hand and
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:026674_0096_0FD156026C4D8D80"/>
the muſket in the other, he deſcended a ſecond time. When he drew nearer than before, the wolf aſſuming a ſtill more fierce and terrible appearance, howling, rolling her eyes, ſnapping her teeth, and dropping her head between her legs, was evidently in the attitude and on the point of ſpringing at him.</p>
            <p n="13">13. At this critical inſtant, he levelled and fired at her head. Stunned with the ſhock, and ſuffocated with the ſmoke, he immediately found himſelf drawn out of the cave. But having refreſhed himſelf and permitted the ſmoke to diſſipate, he went down the third time.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Once more he came within ſight of the wolf, who appearing very paſſive, he applied the torch to her noſe; and perceiving her dead, he took hold of her ears, and then kicking the rope (ſtill tied round his legs) the people above, with no ſmall exultation, dragged them both out together.</p>

In vain, we met the frowns of tyrants; in vain, we croſſed the boiſterous ocean, found a new world, and prepared it for the happy reſidence of Liberty; in vain we toiled; in vain we fought; we bled in vain, if you our offspring want valor to repel the aſſaults of her invaders!</p>

Timothy, Timothy. Here's neighbor Derby, who wants the loan of the grey mare to ride to town to day. You know the ſkin was rubbed off her back laſt week a hand's breadth or more.
<stage>[He gives Tim. a wink.]</stage>
However, I believe ſhe is well enough by this time. You know, Tim, how ready I am to oblige my neighbors. And, indeed, we ought to do all the good we can in this world. We muſt certainly let neighbor Derby have her, if ſhe will poſſibly anſwer his purpoſe. Yes, yes; I ſee plainly by Tim's countenance, neighbor Derby, that he's diſpoſed to oblige you. I would not have refuſed you the mare for the worth of her. If I had, I ſhould have expected you would have refuſed me in your turn. None of my neighbors can accuſe me of being back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in doing them a kindneſs. Come, Timothy, what do you ſay?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Tim.</speaker>
               <p>What do I ſay, father! Why I ſay, Sir, that I am no leſs ready than you are to do a neighborly kindneſs. But the mare is by no means capable of performing the journey. About a hand's breadth did you ſay, Sir! Why the ſkin is torn from the poor creature's back, of the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your great brimm'd hat. And, beſides, I have promiſed her, as ſoon as ſhe is able to travel, to Ned Saun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to carry a load of apples to the market.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scrape.</speaker>
               <p>Do you hear that, neighbor? I am very ſorry matters turn out thus. I would not have diſobliged you for the price of two ſuch mares. Believe me, neighbor Derby, I am really ſorry for your ſake, that matters turn out thus.</p>

               <speaker>Der.</speaker>
               <p>And I as much for yours, neighbor Scrapewell; for to tell you the truth, I received a letter this morning from Mr. Griffin, who tells me if I will be in town this day, he will give me the refuſal of all that lot of timber which he is about cutting down upon the back of cobble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill; and I intended you ſhould have ſhared half of it, which would have been not leſs than fifty dollars in your pocket.

            <sp>
               <speaker>Der.</speaker>
               <p>Ay, truly did I; but as your mare is out of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, I'll go and ſee if I can get old Roan the blackſmith's horſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scrape.</speaker>
               <p>Old Roan! My mare is at your ſervice, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. Here, Tim, tell Ned Saunders he can't have the mare. Neighbor Derby wants her; and I won't refuſe ſo good a friend any thing he aſks for.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Der.</speaker>
               <p>But what are you to do for meal?</p>

            <sp>

               <p>My wife can do without it this fortnight, if you want the mare ſo long.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Der.</speaker>
               <p>But then your ſaddle is all in pieces.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Scrape.</speaker>
               <p>I meant the old one. I have bought a new one ſince; and you ſhall have the firſt uſe of it.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>No, no, I had forgotten to tell you, that I let neighbor Dobſon ſhoe her laſt week by way of trial; and to do him juſtice, I muſt own he ſhoes extremely well.</p>

               <p>She did, indeed, refuſe hay this morning; but the only reaſon was that ſhe was cramm'd full of oats. You have nothing to fear, neighbor; the mare is in perfect trim; and ſhe will ſkim you over the ground like a bird. I wiſh you a good journey and a profitable job.</p>

            <head>ON PROFANE SWEARING.</head>
            <p>FEW evil habits are of more pernicious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, or overcome with more difficulty, than that very odious one of profane curſing and ſwearing. It cannot be expected that the force of moral principles ſhould be very ſtrong upon any one who is accuſtomed, upon every trivial occaſion, and frequently without any occaſion at all, to ſlight the precepts and the character of the Supreme Being.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we have loſt any degree of reſpect for the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of our exiſtence, and the concerns of futurity, and can bring the moſt awful appellations into our ſlighteſt conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, merely by way of embelliſhing our fooliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps fallacious narratives, or to give a greater force to our little reſentments, conſcience will ſoon loſe its influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our minds.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nothing but the fear of diſgrace, or a dread of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man laws, will reſtrain any perſon, addicted to common ſweating, from the moſt deteſtable perjury.</p>
            <p n="4">4. For if a man can be brought to trifle with the moſt ſacred things in his common diſcourſe, he cannot ſurely conſider them of more conſequence when his intereſt leads him to ſwear falſely for his own defence or emolument.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is really aſtoniſhing how imperceptibly this vice creeps upon a perſon, and how rootedly he afterwards ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to it. People generally begin with uſing only ſlight exclamations, and which ſeem hardly to carry the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of any thing criminal; and ſo proceed on to others, till the moſt ſhocking oaths become familiar.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And when once the habit is confirmed, it is rarely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> eradicated. The ſwearer loſes the ideas which are attached to the words he makes uſe of, and therefore exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates his friend when he means to bleſs him; and calls God to witneſs his intention of doing things, which he knows he has no thoughts of performing in reality.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A young gentleman with whom I am intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted, and who poſſeſſes many excellent qualifications, but unhappily in a declining ſtate of health, and evidently tending rapidly to the chambers of death, has been from his
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:026674_0102_0FD12B11412A2050"/>
childhood ſo addicted to the practice of ſwearing in his common converſation, that even now I am frequently ſhocked by his profaning the name of that ſacred Being before whom he, moſt probably, will ſoon be obliged to appear.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It muſt ſurely be exceedingly painful to a ſenſible heart, feeling for the beſt intereſts of a valuable friend, and otherwiſe, excellent acquaintance, to obſerve the perſon he ſo highly regards confirmed in ſuch a ſhocking habit, even while ſtanding in the moſt awful ſituation in which it is poſſible for a human creature to be placed.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Almoſt every other vice affords its votaries ſome pretences of excuſe, from its being productive of preſent pleaſure, or affording a proſpect of future advantage; but the profane ſwearer cannot even ſay that he feels any ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction, or that he hopes to meet with any benefit, from this fooliſh habit.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Let thoſe then, who are addicted to this vice, ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider how aggravated a guilt it is to offend the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity continually, without having the leaſt ſhadow of an excuſe for ſo doing; and determine at once to regulate their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation and conduct in ſuch a manner as to aſſure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the permanent ſatisfaction which will reſult, at the cloſe of life, from the reflection that they have erred no farther from the rules of eternal juſtice, than the common condition of humanity in its preſent ſtate renders unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; and that they have endeavored, to the utmoſt of their power, to correct every error in their conduct, when they have felt it condemned by the dictates of conſcience.</p>

            <head>THE TRIUMPH OF VIRTUE.</head>
            <p>A MERCHANT of Provence, in France, of a moſt amiable character, but of narrow circumſtances, met with ſome conſiderable loſſes in trade, and became a bankrupt. Being reduced to penury and want, he went to Paris to ſeek ſome aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He waited on all his old cuſtomers in trade, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to them his misfortunes, which he had taken every
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:026674_0103_0FD12B96F77693F0"/>
method to avoid, and begged them to enable him to purſue his buſineſs, aſſuring thoſe to whom he was indebted, that his only wiſh was to be in a condition to pay them, and that he ſhould die contentedly, could he but accompliſh that wiſh.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Every one he had applied to felt for his misfortunes, and promiſed to aſſiſt him, excepting one, to whom he ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thouſand crowns, and who, inſtead of pitying his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, threw him into priſon.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The unfortunate merchant's ſon, who was about twenty-two years of age, being informed of the ſorrowful ſituation of his father, haſtened to Paris, threw himſelf at the feet of the unrelenting creditor, and, drowned in tears, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him in the moſt affecting expreſſions, to condeſcend to reſtore him his father, proteſting to him, that, if he would not throw obſtacles in the way to his father's re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his affairs, of the poſſibility of which they had great reaſon to hope, he ſhould be the firſt man paid.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He implored him to have pity on his youth, and to have ſome feelings for the misfortunes of an aged mother, encumbered with eight children, reduced to want, and near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the point of periſhing. Laſtly, that if theſe conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations were not capable of moving him to pity, he entreated him, at leaſt, to permit him to be confined in priſon inſtead of his father, in order that he might be reſtored to his family.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The youth uttered theſe expreſſions in ſo affecting a manner, that the creditor, ſtruck with ſo much virtue and generoſity, at once ſoftened into tears, and raiſing the youth from his humble poſture, Ah! my ſon, ſaid he, your father ſhall be releaſed. So much love and reſpect, which you have ſhown for him, makes me aſhamed of myſelf. I have carried this matter too far; but I will endeavor forever to efface the remembrance of it from your mind.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I have an only daughter, who is worthy of you; ſhe would do as much for me, as you have done for your father. I will give her to you, and with her, all my fortune.

            <head>FEMALE INDUSTRY.</head>
            <p>WHAT a happy ſimplicity prevailed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, when it was the cuſtom for ladies, though of the greateſt diſtinction, to employ themſelves in uſeful, and ſometimes laborious works! Every one knows what is told us in ſcripture to this purpoſe concerning Rebecca, Rachel, and ſeveral others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We read in Homer of princeſſes drawing themſelves water from ſprings, and waſhing with their own hands the fineſt of the linen of their reſpective families. The ſiſters of Alexander the Great, who were the daughters of a powerful prince, employed themſelves in making clothes for their brothers. The celebrated Lucretia uſed to ſpin in the midſt of her female attendants.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Auguſtus, who was ſovereign of the world, wore for ſeveral years together, no other clothes but what his wife and ſiſter made him. It was a cuſtom in the northern parts of the world, not many years ago, for the princeſſes, who then ſat upon the throne, to prepare ſeveral of the diſhes at every meal.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In a word, needle work, the care of domeſtic af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and a ſerious and retired life, is the proper function of women, and for this they were deſigned by Providence. The depravity of the age has indeed affixed to theſe cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, which are very near as old as the creation, an idea of meanneſs and contempt; but then, what has it ſubſtituted in the room of them? A ſoft indolence, a ſtupid idleneſs, frivolous converſation, vain amuſements, and a ſtrong paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for public ſhows.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let us compare theſe two characters, and pronounce which of them may juſtly boaſt its being founded on good ſenſe, ſolid judgment, and a taſte for truth and nature.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It muſt, nevertheleſs, be confeſſed, in honor of the fair ſex, and of the American ladies in particular, that many among them, and thoſe of the higheſt ſtations in life, have made it not only a duty, but a pleaſure, to employ themſelves in needle work, not of a trifling, but of the moſt ſerviceable kind; and to make part of their furniture with

               <p>Upon my word, Nancy, you have mended the matter mightily! Your aunt is aſhamed to be ſeen walking with a child in her arms; but is not aſhamed to be ſeen carrying a paltry puppy through the ſtreets! Pray how much more valuable is a puppy than a child?</p>

               <p>Why, as to the real value, Eliza, I don't know but a child ſhould be prized the higheſt. Though my aunt ſays ſhe had rather part with both her twins than loſe her dear little <hi>Trip.</hi> But, you know, ſhe would be taken for one of the <hi>lower ſort</hi> of women, if ſhe were to lug a child about with her; whereas nothing makes her appear more like a <hi>lady</hi> than to be ſeen gallanting her little dog. And <hi>Trip</hi> is none of your <hi>common curs,</hi> I aſſure you. His mother was imported from Europe; and it is ſaid ſhe once belonged to a lady of nobility.

               <p>O no, indeed! She would run crazy, if ſhe were to loſe him but for one day. And no wonder; for he is the moſt engaging little animal you ever ſaw. You would be diverted to ſee him drink tea out of the ladies' cups. And he kiſſes his miſtreſs delightfully! My aunt ſays ſhe would not ſleep a night without him for his weight in gold.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Eli.</speaker>
               <p>It is very noble in your aunt to pay ſuch attention to an object of ſo much conſequence. He is certainly more valuable than <hi>half a dozen</hi> children. Does your aunt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to learn him to talk?</p>

               <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
               <p>Talk! why he talks already. She ſays ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly underſtands his language. When he is hungry, he can aſk for ſweet meats. When he is dry, he can aſk for drink. When he is tired of running on foot, he can aſk to ride; and my aunt is never more happy than when ſhe has him in her arms!</p>

            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Nan.</speaker>
               <p>Why, that would be very <hi>vulgar;</hi> and all her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance would laugh at her. Children, you know, are always crying; and no ladies of faſhion will ever admit them into their company.</p>

               <p>Oh, the barking of <hi>Trip</hi> is <hi>muſic</hi> to all who hear him! Mr. Fribble, who often viſits my aunt, ſays he can raiſe and fall the eight notes to perfection; and he prefers the ſound of his voice to that of the harpſichord. It was he who brought his mother from London; and he ſays there was not a greater favorite among all the dogs, in poſſeſſion of the fine ladies of court. And, more than all that, he ſays <hi>Trip</hi> greatly reſembles a ſpaniel which belongs to one of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al family.

               <p>After hearing ſo many rare qualifications of the little quadruped, I do not wonder at your aunt's choice of a companion. I am not ſurprized ſhe ſhould ſet her affections upon a creature ſo deſerving of all her care. It is to be

<date>JULY 4, 1787.</date>
            </head>
            <p>THAT Education is one of the deepeſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of independence, need not be labored in this aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. In arbitrary governments, where the people neither make the law nor chuſe thoſe who legiſlate, the more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance the more peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But in a government where the people fill all the branches of the ſovereignty, <hi>intelligence</hi> is the life of liberty. An American would reſent his being denied the uſe of his muſket; but he would deprive himſelf of a ſtronger ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, if he ſhould want that <hi>learning</hi> which is neceſſary to a knowledge of his conſtitution.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is eaſy to ſee that our agrarian law and the law of education were calculated to make republicans; to make <hi>men.</hi> Servitude could never long conſiſt with the habits of ſuch citizens. Enlightened minds and virtuous manners lead to the gates of glory. The ſentiment of independence muſt have been <hi>connatural</hi> in the boſoms of Americans; and, ſooner or later, muſt have blazed out into public action.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Independence fits the ſoul of her reſidence for every noble enterprize of humanity and greatneſs. Her radiant ſmile lights up celeſtial ardor in poets and orators, who ſound her praiſes through all ages; in legiſlators and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, who fabricate wiſe and happy governments as dedications to her fame; in patriots and heroes, who ſhed their lives in ſacrifice to her divinity.</p>
            <p n="5">5. At this idea, do not our minds ſwell with the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of thoſe whoſe godlike virtues have founded her moſt
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:026674_0108_0FD15612C4F491E8"/>
magnificent temple in America? It is eaſy for us to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her doctrines, at this late day, when there is but <hi>one</hi> party on the ſubject, an immenſe people. But what trib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ute ſhall we beſtow, what ſacred paean ſhall we raiſe over the tombs of thoſe who dared, in the face of unrivalled power, and within the reach of majeſty, to blow the blaſt of freedom throughout a ſubject continent?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Nor did thoſe brave countrymen of ours only <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> the emotions of glory: the nature of their principles inſpired them with the power of <hi>practice;</hi> and they offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their boſoms to the ſhafts of battle. Bunker's awful mount is the capacious urn of their aſhes; but the flaming bounds of the univerſe could not limit the flight of their minds.</p>
            <p n="7">7. They fled to the union of kindred ſouls; and thoſe who fell at the ſtreights of Thermopylae, and thoſe who bled on the heights of Charleſtown, now reap congenial joys in the fields of the bleſſed.</p>

            <head>GENERAL WASHINGTON'S RESIGNATION.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MR. PRESIDENT,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE great events on which my reſignation depended having at length taken place, I have now the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of offering my ſincere congratulations to Congreſs, and of preſenting myſelf before them to ſurrender into their hands the truſt committed to me, and to claim the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of retiring from the ſervice of my country.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Happy in the confirmation of our independence and ſovereignty, and pleaſed with the opportunity afforded the United States of becoming a reſpectable nation, I reſign, with ſatisfaction, the appointment I accepted with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; a diffidence in my abilities to accompliſh ſo ardu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a taſk, which, however was ſuperſeded by a confidence in the rectitude of our cauſe, the ſupport of the ſupreme power of the Union, and the patronage of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſucceſsful termination of the war has verified the moſt ſanguine expectations; and my gratitude for the interpoſition of Providence, and the aſſiſtance I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:026674_0109_0FD1561498582998"/>
from my countrymen, increaſes with every review of the momentous conteſt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. While I repeat my obligations to the army in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, I ſhould do injuſtice to my own feelings not to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, in this place, the peculiar ſervices and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed merits of the gentlemen who have been attached to my perſon during the war.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It was impoſſible the choice of confidential officers to compoſe my family ſhould have been more fortunate. Permit me, Sir, to recommend in particular thoſe who have continued in the ſervice to the preſent moment, as worthy of the favorable notice and patronage of Congreſs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I conſider it as an indiſpenſable duty to cloſe this laſt ſolemn act of my official life, by commending the intereſts of our deareſt country to the protection of Almighty God, and thoſe who have the ſuperintendence of them, to his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly keeping.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Having now finiſhed the work aſſigned me, I retire from the great theatre of action; and bidding an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate farewell to this auguſt body, under whoſe orders I have ſo long acted, I here offer my commiſſion, and take my leave of all the employments of public life.</p>

            <head>SPEECH OF A SCYTHIAN AMBASSADOR TO ALEXANDER.</head>
            <p>WHEN the Scythian ambaſſadors waited on Alexander the Great, they gazed on him a long time without ſpeaking a word, being very probably ſurpriſed, as they formed a judgment of men from their air and ſtature, to find that his did not anſwer the high idea they entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him from his fame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. At laſt the oldeſt of the ambaſſadors addreſſed him thus. "Had the gods given thee a body proportionable to thy ambition, the whole univerſe would have been too little for thee. With one hand thou wouldſt touch the Eaſt, and with the other the Weſt; and, not ſatisfied with this,
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:026674_0110_0FD156149C49C2A0"/>
thou wouldſt follow the ſun, and know where he hides himſelf.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But what have we to do with thee? We never ſet foot in thy country. May not thoſe who inhabit woods be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to live, without knowing who thou art, and whence thou comeſt? We will neither command over, or ſubmit to any man.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And that thou mayeſt be ſenſible what kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Scythians are, know, that we received from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, as a rich preſent, a yoke of oxen, a plowſhare, a dart, a javelin, and a cup. Theſe we make uſe of, both with our friends and againſt our enemies.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To our friends we give corn, which we procure by the labor of our oxen; with them we offer wine to the gods in our cup; and with regard to our enemies, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat them at a diſtance with our arrows, and near at hand with our javelins.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But thou, who boaſteſt thy coming to extirpate rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, art thyſelf the greateſt robber upon earth. Thou haſt plundered all nations thou overcameſt; thou haſt poſſeſſed thyſelf of Lybia, invaded Syria, Perſia, and Bactriana; thou art forming a deſign to march as far as India, and now thou comeſt hither to ſeize upon our herds of cattle.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The great poſſeſſions thou haſt, only make thee covet the more eagerly what thou haſt not. If thou art a god, thou oughteſt to do good to mortals, and not deprive them of their poſſeſſions.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If thou art a mere man, reflect always on what thou art. They whom thou ſhalt not moleſt will be thy true friends; the ſtrongeſt friendſhips being contracted between equals; and they are eſteemed equals who have not tried their ſtrengh againſt each other. But do not ſuppoſe that thoſe whom thou conquereſt can love thee."</p>

            <head>THE REVENGE OF A GREAT SOUL.</head>
            <p>DEMETRIUS Poliorcetes, who had done ſingular ſervices for the people of the city of Athens, on ſetting out for a war in which he was engaged, leſt his wife
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:026674_0111_0FD156149FA0B5D0"/>
and children to their protection. He loſt the battle, and was obliged to ſeek ſecurity for his perſon in flight.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He doubted not, at firſt, but that he ſhould find a ſafe aſylum among his good friends the Athenians; but thoſe ungrateful people refuſed to receive him, and even ſent back to him his wife and children, under pretence, that they probably might not be ſafe in Athens, where the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my might come and take them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This conduct pierced the heart of Demetrius; for nothing is ſo affecting to an honeſt mind, as the ingratitude of thoſe we love, and to whom we have done ſingular ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. Some time afterwards, this prince recoverd his affairs, and came with a large army to lay ſiege to Athens.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Athenians, perſuaded that they had no pardon to expect from Demetrius, determined to die ſword in hand, and paſſed a decree, which condemned to death thoſe who ſhould firſt propoſe to ſurrender to that prince; but they did not recollect, that there was but little corn in the city, and that they would in a ſhort time be in want of bread.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Want ſoon made them ſenſible of their error: and, after having ſuffered hunger for a long time, the moſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable among them ſaid, "It would be better that Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius ſhould kill us at once, than for us to die by the linger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing death of famine. Perhaps he will have pity on our wives and children." They then opened to him the gates of the city.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Demetrius, having taken poſſeſſion of the city, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that all the married men ſhould aſſemble in a ſpacious place appointed for the purpoſe, and that the ſoldiery, ſword in hand, ſhould ſurround them. Cries and lamentations were then heard from every quarter of the city; women embracing their huſbands, children their parents, and all taking an eternal farewell of each other.</p>
            <p n="7">7. When the married men were all thus collected, Demetrius, for whom an elevated ſituation was provided, reproached them for their ingratitude in the moſt feeling manner, inſomuch that he himſelf could not help ſhedding tears. Demetrius for ſome time remained ſilent, while the Athenians expected, that the next words he uttered would be to order his ſoldiers to maſſacre them all.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="112" facs="unknown:026674_0112_0FD15616F81E93C0"/>8. It is hardly poſſible to ſay what muſt have been their ſurprize, when they heard that good prince ſay, "I wiſh to convince you how ungenerouſly you have treated me; for it was not to an enemy you have refuſed aſſiſtance, but to a prince who loved you, who ſtill loves you, and who wiſhes to revenge himſelf only by granting your pardon, and by being ſtill your friend. Return to your own homes: while you have been here, my ſoldiers have been filling your houſes with proviſions."</p>

            <head>CUDJOE, THE FAITHFUL AFRICAN.</head>
            <p>A NEW-ENGLAND ſloop, trading on the coaſt of Guinea, in 1752, left a ſecond mate, William Murray. ſick on ſhore, and ſailed without him. Murray was at the houſe of a black man named Cudjoe, with whom he had contracted an acquaintance during their trade.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He recovered; and the ſloop being gone, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with his black friend till ſome other opportunity ſhould offer of his getting home. In the mean time a Dutch ſhip came into the road, and ſome of the blacks coming on board her, were treacherouſly ſeized and carried off as their ſlaves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The relations and friends, tranſported with ſudden rage, ran to the houſe of Cudjoe, to take revenge by killing Murray. Cudjoe ſtopped them at the door, and demanded what they wanted. The white men, ſaid they, have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away our brothers and ſons, and we will kill all white men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Give us the white man you have in your houſe, for we will kill him. Nay, ſaid Cudjoe, the white men who carried away your relations are bad men; kill them when you can take them; but this white man is a good man, and you muſt not kill him. But he is a white man, they cried; and the white men are all bad men; we muſt kill them all. Nay, ſays he, you muſt not kill a man who has done no harm, only for being white.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This man is my friend, my houſe is his poſt, I am his ſoldier, and muſt fight for him; you muſt kill me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:026674_0113_0FD1561879FA4900"/>
you can kill him. What good man will ever come again under my roof, if I let my floor be ſtained with a good man's blood?</p>
            <p n="6">6. The negroes ſeeing his reſolution, and being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by his diſcourſe that they were wrong, went away aſhamed. In a few days Murray ventured abroad again with his friend Cudjoe, when ſeveral of them took him by the hand, and told him, they were glad they had not killed him; for as he was a good meaning, innocent man, their god would have been very angry, and would have ſpoiled their fiſhing.</p>

               <p>I did not mean to inſiſt on any engagements with my huſband and children. I never thought myſelf engaged to them. I had no engagements but ſuch as were common to women in high life. Look at my memoran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, and you will ſee I was engaged to the play on Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, balls on Tueſdays, routs on Saturdays, and to card aſſemblies the reſt of the week for two months to come; and it would be the rudeſt thing in the world not to keep my appointments. If you will ſtay for me till the ſummer ſeaſon, I will wait on you with all my heart. Perhaps the elyſian fields may be leſs deteſtable than the country in our world. Pray have you a fine theatre, pleaſant gardens, and elegant aſſemblies there? I think I ſhould not diſlike drinking the Lethe waters when you have a full ſeaſon.</p>

               <p>O Sir, excuſe me; it is one of the privileges of the <hi>bon ton</hi> never to define or be defined. It is the child and parent of jargon. It is—I can never tell you what it is; but I will try to tell you what it is not. In converſation it is not wit; in manners it is not politeneſs; in behavior it is not addreſs; but it is a little like them all. It can only belong to people of a certain rank, who live in a certain manner, with certain perſons, and who have not certain virtues, and who have certain vices, and who inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it a certain part of the town.

            <p>THAT you may not be unapprized, ſoldiers, of what ſort of enemies you are about to encounter, or what is to be feared from them, I tell you they are the very ſame, whom, in a former war, you vanquiſhed both by land and ſea; the ſame from whom you took Sicily and Sardinia; and who have been th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. But you have heard, perhaps, that, though they are few in number, they are men of ſtout hearts and robuſt bod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies; heroes of ſuch ſtrength and vigor as nothing is able to reſiſt. Mere effigies! nay, ſhadows of men! wretches, emaciated with hunger and benumbed with cold! bruiſed

and battered to pieces among the rocks and craggy cliffs! their weapons broken, and their horſes weak and foundered!</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such are the cavalry, and ſuch the infantry, with which you are going to contend; not enemies, bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of enemies. There is nothing which I more appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, than that it will be thought Hannibal was vanquiſhed by the Alps before we had any conflict with him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I need not be in any fear that you ſhould ſuſpect me of ſaying theſe things merely to encourage you, while inwardly I have different ſentiments. Have I ever ſhown any inclination to avoid a conteſt with this tremendous Hannibal? and have I now met with him only by acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and unawares? or am I come on purpoſe to challenge him to the combat?</p>
            <p n="6">6. I would gladly try, whether the earth, within theſe twenty years, has brought forth a new kind of Carthageni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; or whether they be the ſame ſort of men who fought at the Aegates, and whom at Eryx you ſuffered to redeem themſelves at eighteen denarii per head. Whether this Hannibal, for labors and journies, be as he would be thought, the rival of Hercules; or whether he be what his father left him, a tributary, a vaſſal, a ſlave to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man people.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Did not the conſciouſneſs of his wicked deed at Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guntum torment him and make him deſperate, he would have ſome regard, if not to his conquered country, yet ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to his own family, to his father's memory, to the treaty written with Amilcar's own hand. We might have ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in Eryx; we might have paſſed into Africa with our victorious fleet, and in a few days have deſtroyed Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage.</p>
            <p n="8">8. At their humble ſupplication, we pardoned them. We releaſed them when they were cloſely ſhut up without a poſſibility of eſcaping. We made peace with them when they were conquered. When they were diſtreſſed by the African war, we conſidered them, and treated them as a people under our protection.</p>
            <p n="9">9. And what is the return they make us for all theſe favors! Under the conduct of a hair-brained young man, they come hither to overturn our ſtate, and lay waſte our country.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="119" facs="unknown:026674_0119_0FD15626D7C92C20"/>10. I could wiſh, indeed, that it were not ſo; and that the war we are now engaged in concerned our glory only, and not our preſervation. But the conteſt at preſent is not for the poſſeſſion of Sicily and Sardinia, but of Italy itſelf. Nor is there behind us another army, which, if we ſhould not prove the conquerors, may make head againſt our vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious enemies.</p>
            <p n="11">11. There are no more Alps for them to paſs, which might give us leiſure to raiſe new forces. No, ſoldiers; here you muſt take your ſtand, as if you were juſt now before the walls of Rome. Let every one reflect, that he is now to defend, not his own perſon only, but his wife, his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, his helpleſs infants.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Yet, let not private conſiderations alone poſſeſs our minds. Let us remember that the eyes of the ſenate and people of Rome are upon us; and that, as our force and courage ſhall now prove, ſuch will be the fortune of that city, and of the Roman empire.</p>

            <p>ON what ſide ſoever I turn my eyes, I behold all full of courage and ſtrength. A veteran infantry; a moſt gallant cavalry; you, my allies, moſt faithful and val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iant; you, Carthagenians, whom, not only your country's cauſe, but the juſteſt anger, impels to battle. The hope, the courage of aſſailants, is always greater than that of thoſe who act upon the defenſive.</p>
            <p n="2">2. With hoſtile banners diſplayed, you are come down upon Italy. You bring the war. Grief, injuries, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, fire your minds, and ſpur you forward to revenge. Firſt, they demanded me; that I, your general, ſhould be delivered up to them; next, all of you who had fought at the ſiege of Saguntum; and we were to be put to death by excruciating tortures.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Proud and cruel nation! Every thing muſt be yours, and at your diſpoſal! You are to preſcribe to us with whom

we are to make war, with whom to make peace! You are to ſet us bounds; to ſhut us up between hills and rivers; but you are not to obſerve the limits which yourſelves have fixed!</p>
            <p n="4">4. "Paſs not the Iberus." What next? "Touch not the Saguntines; Saguntum is upon the Iberus; move not a ſtep towards that city." Is it a ſmall matter, then, that you have deprived us of our ancient poſſeſſions, Sicily and Sardinia? You would have Spain too!</p>
            <p n="5">5. Well, we ſhall yield Spain, and then—you will paſs into Africa. <hi>Will</hi> paſs, did I ſay? This very year, they ordered one of their conſuls into Africa, the other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Spain. No, ſoldiers, there is nothing left for us but what we can vindicate with our ſwords.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Come on, then. Be men. The Romans may, with more ſafety, be cowards. They have their own country behind them; have places of refuge to flee to; and are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from danger in the roads thither. But for <hi>you,</hi> there is no middle fortune between death and victory. Let this be but well fixed in your minds; and, once again, I ſay you are <hi>conquerors.</hi>

            <opener>
               <salute>CITIZENS OF NEW-HAMPSHIRE,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>HAVING ſpent above twenty years of my life with you, and paſſed through various ſcenes of peace and war within that time; being perſonally acquainted with many of you, both in your public and private characters; and having an earneſt deſire to promote your true intereſt, I truſt you will not think me altogether unqualified to give you a few hints by way of advice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You are certainly a riſing State; your numbers are rapidly increaſing; and your importance in the political ſcale will be augmented, in proportion to your improving
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:026674_0121_0FD1562951DC8A50"/>
the natural advantages which your ſituation affords you, and to your cultivating the intellectual and moral powers of yourſelves and your children.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The firſt article on which I would open my mind to you is that of <hi>education.</hi> Nature has been as bountiful to you as to any other people, in giving your children ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and capacity; it is then your duty and your intereſt to cultivate their capacities, and render them ſerviceable to themſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es and the community.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It was the ſaying of a great orator and ſtateſman of antiquity, that "The loſs which the Commonwealth ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, by a want of education, is like the loſs which the year would ſuffer by the deſtruction of the ſpring."</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the bud be blaſted, the tree will yield no fruit. If the ſpringing corn be cut down, there will be no harveſt. So if the youth be ruined through a fault in their education, the community ſuſtains a loſs which cannot be repaired; "for it is too late to correct them when they are ſpoiled."</p>
            <p n="6">6. Notwithſtanding the care of your legiſlators in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting laws, and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>cing them by ſevere penalties; not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the wiſe and liberal proviſion which is made by ſome towns, and ſome private gentlemen in the State; yet there is ſtill, in many places, "A great and criminal neglect of education."</p>
            <p n="7">7. You are indeed a very conſiderable degree better, in this reſpect, than in the time of the late war; but yet much remains to be done. Great care ought to be taken, not only to provide a ſupport for inſtructors of children and youth; but to be attentive in the choice of inſtructors; to ſee that they be men of good underſtanding, learning and morals; that they teach by their example as well as by their precepts; that they govern themſelves, and teach their pupils the art of ſelf-government.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Another ſource of improvement which I beg leave to recommend, is the eſtabliſhment of ſocial libraries. This is the eaſieſt, the cheapeſt and moſt effectual mode of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing knowledge among the people. For the ſum of ſix or eight dollars at once, and a ſmall annual payment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, a man may be ſupplied with the means of literary im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, during his life, and his children may inherit the bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="122" facs="unknown:026674_0122_0FD156295953F2A0"/>9. A few neighbors, joined together in ſetting up a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, and placing it under the care of ſome ſuitable perſon, with a very few regulations, to prevent careleſsneſs and waſte, may render the moſt eſſential ſervice to themſelves and to the community.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Books may be much better preſerved in this way, than if they belonged to individuals; and there is an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the ſocial intercourſe of perſons who have read the ſame books, by their converſing on the ſubjects which have occurred in their reading, and communicating their obſervations one to another.</p>
            <p n="11">11. From this mutual intercourſe another advantage may ariſe; for the perſons who are thus aſſociated may not only acquire but <hi>originate</hi> knowledge. By ſtudying nature and the ſciences; by practiſing arts, agriculture and manufactures, at the ſame time that they improve their minds in reading, they may be led to diſcoveries and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements, original and beneficial; and being already formed into ſociety, they may diffuſe their knowledge, ripen their plans, correct their miſtakes, and promote the cauſe of ſcience and humanity in a very conſiderable degree.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The book of nature is always open to our view, and we may ſtudy it at our leiſure. "'Tis elder ſcripture; writ by God's own hand." The earth, the air, the ſea, the rivers, the mountains, the rocks, the caverns, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal and vegetable tribes are fraught with inſtruction. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not half explored; and in what is partly known there are many myſteries, which time, obſervation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience muſt unfold.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Every ſocial library, among other books, ſhould be furniſhed with thoſe of natural philoſophy, botany, zoolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, chymiſtry, huſbandry, geopraphy and aſtronomy; that inquiring minds may be directed in their inquiries; that they may ſee what is known and what ſtill remains to be diſcovered; and that they may employ their leiſure and their various opportunities in endeavoring to add to the ſtock of ſcience, and thus enrich the world with their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations and improvements.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Suffer me to add a few words on the uſe of <hi>ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquor,</hi> that bane of ſociety, that deſtroye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of health, morals and property. Nature indeed has furniſhed her
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:026674_0123_0FD1562AE6A1D4E0"/>
vegetable productions with <hi>ſpirit;</hi> but ſhe has ſo combined it with other ſubſtances, that unleſs her work be tortured by fire, the ſpirit is not ſeparated, and cannot prove perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. Why ſhould this force be put on nature, to make her yield a noxious draught, when all her original prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſalutary?</p>
            <p n="15">15. The juice of the apple, the fermentation of barley, and the decoction of ſpruce are amply ſufficient for the refreſhment of man, let his labor be ever ſo ſevere, and his perſpiration ever ſo expenſive. Our forefathers, for many years after the ſettlement of the country, knew not the uſe of diſtilled ſpirits.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Malt was imported from England, and wine from the Weſtern or Canary Iſlands, with which they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed, before their own fields and orchards yielded them a ſupply. An expedition was once undertaken againſt a nation of Indians, when there was but <hi>one pint</hi> of ſtrong water (as it was then called) in the whole army, and that was reſerved for the ſick; yet no complaint was made for want of refreſhment.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Could we but return to the primitive manners of our anceſtors, in this reſpect, we ſhould be free from many of the diſorders, both of body and mind, which are now experienced. The diſuſe of ardent ſpirits would alſo tend to aboliſh the infamous traffic in ſlaves, by whoſe labor this baneful material is procured.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Divine Providence ſeems to be preparing the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y for the deſtruction of that deteſtable commerce. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrections of the blacks in the Weſt-Indies have already ſpread deſolation over the moſt fertile plantations, and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed the price of thoſe commodities which we have been uſed to import from thence.</p>
            <p n="19">19. If we could check the conſumption of diſtilled ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its, and enter with vigor into the manufacture of maple ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, of which our foreſts would afford an ample ſupply, the demand for Weſt-India-productions might be diminiſhed; the plantations in the iſlands would not need freſh recruits from Africa; the planters would treat with humanity their remaining blacks; the market for ſlaves would become leſs inviting; and the navigation which is now employed in

               <speaker>Cic.</speaker>
               <p>True; your condeſcenſion was great indeed. You were the pander of your ſon. You not only taught him the mean arts of diſſimulation, the petty tricks which degrade nobility; but you corrupted his principles, fomented his paſſions, and even pointed out objects for their gratification. You might have left the taſk of teaching him faſhionable vice, to a vicious world. Example, and the corrupt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of human nature, will ever be capable of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing this unnatural purpoſe. But a parent, the guardian appointed by nature for an uninſtructed offspring introduced into a dangerous world, who himſelf takes upon him the office of ſeduction, is a monſter indeed. I alſo had a ſon. I was tenderly ſolicitous for the right conduct of his education. I entruſted him indeed to Cratippus at Athens; but, like you, I could not help tranſmitting inſtructions dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by paternal love. Thoſe inſtructions are contained in my book of Offices, a book which has ever been cited by the world as a proof, to what a height the morality of the heathens was advanced without the light of revelation. I own, I feel a conſcious pride in it; not on account of the ability which it may diſplay, but for the principles it teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and the good, I flatter myſelf, it has diffuſed. You did not indeed intend your inſtructions for the world; but as you gave them to a ſon you loved, it may be concluded that you thought them true wiſdom, and withheld them on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they were contrary to the profeſſions of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enlightened. They have been generally read; and their uniform tendency has been to introduce vice and immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality.</p>

            <head>OF THE ELEPHANT.</head>
            <p>THE Elephant is not only the moſt tractable, but the moſt intelligent of animals; ſenſible of benefits, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentful of injuries, and endued even with a ſenſe of glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In India, they were once employed in the launching of ſhips. One was directed to force a very large ſhip into the water; the work proved ſuperior to his ſtrength; his maſter, with a ſarcaſtic tone, bid the keeper take away this lazy beaſt and bring another; the poor animal inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated his efforts, fractured his ſkull, and died on the ſpot.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Delhi, an elephant paſſing along the ſtreets put his trunk into a taylor's ſhop, where ſeveral people were at work; one of them pricked the end of it with a needle; the beaſt paſſed on; but, in the next dirty puddle, filled his trunk with water, returned to the ſhop, and ſpurting ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery drop among the people who had offended him, ſpoiled their work.</p>
            <p n="4">4. An elephant in Adſmeer, which often paſſed through the market, as he went by a certain herb woman, always received from her a mouthful of greens. At length he was ſeized with one of his periodical fits of rage, broke his fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and running through the market, put the crowd to flight; among others, this woman, who, in her haſte, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got a little child ſhe had brought with her.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The animal recollecting the ſpot where his benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs was wont to ſit, took up the infant gently in his trunk, and placed it in ſafety on a ſtall before a neighboring houſe. Another, in his madneſs, killed his governor; the wife ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the misfortune, took her two children and flung them before the elephant, ſaying, "Now you have deſtroyed their father, you may as well put an end to their lives and mine."</p>
            <p n="6">6. He inſtantly ſtopped, relented, took the greateſt of the children, placed it on his neck, adopted it for his <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac</hi>
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:026674_0129_0FD156354C1552A0"/>
or governor, and never afterwards would permit any body elſe to mount him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. A ſoldier at Pondicherry, who was accuſtomed, whenever he received the portion that came to his ſhare, to carry a certain quantity of it to one of theſe animals, having one day drank rather too freely, and finding himſelf pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the guards, who were going to take him to priſon, took refuge under the elephant's body, and fell aſleep.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In vain did the guard try to force him from this aſylum, as the elephant protected him with his trunk. The next morning the ſoldier recovering from his drunken fit, ſhuddered with horror to find himſelf ſtretched under the belly of this huge animal.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The elephant, which without doubt perceived the man's embarraſſment, careſſed him with his trunk, in order to inſpire him with courage, and make him underſtand that he might now depart in ſafety.</p>
            <p n="10">10. A painter was deſirous of drawing the elephant which was kept in the menagerie at Verſailles in an uncommon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which was that of holding his trunk raiſed up in the air with his mouth open. The painter's boy, in order to keep the animal in this poſture, threw fruit into his mouth.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But, as the lad frequently deceived him, and made an offer only of throwing him the fruit, he grew angry; and, as if he had known that the painter's intention of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him was the cauſe of the affront that was offered him, inſtead of revenging himſelf on the lad, he turned his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment on the maſter, and taking up a quantity of water in his trunk, threw it on the paper on which the painter was drawing, and ſpoiled it.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Nor, Sir, do I now anſwer him for any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than to remind him how little the clamors of rage, and petulancy of invective, contribute to the purpoſes for which this aſſembly is called together; how little the diſcovery of truth is promoted, and the ſecurity of the nation eſtabliſhed by pompous diction and theatrical emotions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Formidable ſounds and furious declamations, confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent aſſertions, and lofty periods, may affect the young and unexperienced; and perhaps the gentleman may have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted his habits of oratory by converſing more with thoſe of his own age than with ſuch as have had more opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of acquiring knowledge, and more ſucceſsful methods of communicating their ſentiments.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If the heat of his temper, Sir, would ſuffer him to attend to thoſe whoſe age and long acquaintance with bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs give them an indiſputable right to deference and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, he would learn, in time, to reaſon rather than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim, and to prefer juſtneſs of argument, and an accurate knowledge of facts, to ſounding epithets and ſplendid ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latives, which may diſturb the imagination for a moment, but leave no laſting impreſſion on the mind.</p>
            <p n="6">6. He will learn, Sir, that to accuſe and prove are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different, and that reproaches, unſupported by evidence, affect only the character of him who utters them. Excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of fancy and flights of oratory are indeed pardonable in young men, but in no other; and it would ſurely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute more, even to the purpoſe for which ſome gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men appear to ſpeak; that of depreciating the conduct of the adminiſtration, to prove the inconveniences and injuſtice of this bill, than barely to aſſert them, with whatever mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence of language or appearance of zeal, honeſty, or compaſſion.</p>

            <head>Mr. PITT'S ANSWER TO THE FORE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GOING.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE atrocious crime of being a young man, which the honorable gentleman has, with ſuch ſpirit and decency, charged upon me, I ſhall neither attempt to palliate nor deny; but content myſelf with wiſhing, that I may be one of thoſe whoſe follies may ceaſe with their youth, and not of that number who are ignorant in ſpite of experience.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whether youth can be imputed to any man as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, I will not, Sir, aſſume the province of determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but ſurely age may become juſtly contemptible, if the opportunities which it brings have paſſed away without im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, and vice appears to prevail, when the paſſions have ſubſided.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The wretch, who, after having ſeen the conſequences of a thouſand errors, continues ſtill to blunder, and whoſe age has only added obſtinacy to ſtupidity, is ſurely the object of either abhorrence or contempt, and deſerves not that his grey head ſhould ſecure him from inſults.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Much more, Sir, is he to be abhorred, who, as he has advanced in age, has receded from virtue, and becomes more wicked with leſs temptation; who proſtitutes himſelf for money which he cannot enjoy, and ſpends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But youth, Sir, is not my only crime; I have been accuſed of acting a theatrical part. A theatrical part may either imply ſome peculiarities of geſture, or a diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my real ſentiments, and an adoption of the opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions and language of another man.</p>
            <p n="6">6. In the firſt ſenſe, Sir, the charge is too trifling to be confuted, and deſerves only to be mentioned that it may be deſpiſed. I am at liberty, like every other man, to uſe my own language; and though I may perhaps have ſome am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition to pleaſe this gentleman, I ſhall not lay myſelf under any reſtraint, not very ſolicitouſly copy his diction or his mien, however matured by age, or modelled by experience.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="132" facs="unknown:026674_0132_0FD1563BB102D830"/>7. If any man ſhall, by charging me with theatrical be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior, imply, that I utter any ſentiments but my own, I ſhall treat him as a calumniator and a villain; nor ſhall any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection ſhelter him from the treatment which he deſerves.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I ſhall, on ſuch an occaſion, without ſcruple, trample upon all thoſe forms with which wealth and dignity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench themſelves; nor ſhall any thing but age reſtrain my reſentment. Age, which always brings one privilege, that of being inſolent and ſupercilious without puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="9">9. But with regard, Sir, to thoſe whom I have offended, I am of opinion, that if I had acted a borrowed part, I ſhould have avoided their cenſure. The heat which offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them is the ardor of conviction, and that zeal for the ſervice of my country, which neither hope nor fear ſhall influence me to ſuppreſs.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I will not ſit unconcerned while my liberty is inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, nor look in ſilence upon public robbery. I will exert my endeavors, at whatever hazard, to repel the aggreſſor and drag the thief to juſtice, whoever may protect them in their villany, and whoever may partake of their plunder.</p>

            <head>STORY OF A SECOND JOSEPH.</head>
            <p>THE following relation proves, that incidents ſomewhat ſimilar to thoſe in the times of Jacob are ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in Egypt. In 1776, the plains of Syria were rav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged by clouds of locuſts, which devoured the corn to the very root.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A famine followed, and a farmer near Damaſcus felt the effects of the general diſtreſs. To ſupply the wants of a numerous family, he ſold his cattle; which reſource being ſoon exhauſted, the unhappy father, wretched at preſent, but foreſeeing greater wretchedneſs to come, preſſed by hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſold his inſtruments of huſbandry at Damaſcus.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Led by the inviſible hand of Providence, as formerly Tobias was by the angel, while he bargained for corn, lately arrived from Damietta, he heard ſpeak of the ſucceſs of Mourad Bey, who had entered Grand Cairo victorious, and in triumph.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:026674_0133_0FD1563D1E672C30"/>4. The ſhape, character, and origin of the warrior were deſcribed, and how he had riſen from ſlavery to power ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme. The aſtoniſhed farmer found the deſcription ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded with a ſon, who had been ſtolen from him at twelve years old; hope palpitated in his heart, he haſtened home with his proviſions, told his family what he had heard, and determined immediately to depart for Egypt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. His weeping wife and ſons offered up prayers for his ſafe return. Going to the port of Alexandretta, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked there, and came to Damietta. One continued fear tormented him; his ſon, forſaking the religion of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, had embraced Mahometaniſm; and now, ſurrounded as he was by ſplendor, would be acknowledge his parents?</p>
            <p n="6">6. The thought lay heavy on his heart; yet, the wiſh to ſnatch his family from all the horrors of famine; the hope of finding a long lamented ſon, gave him fortitude. He continued his journey, came to the capital, repaired to the palace of Mourad, applied to the officers of the prince, and moſt ardently ſolicited admiſſion.</p>
            <p n="7">7. His dreſs and appearance beſpoke poverty and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, and were poor recommendations; but his great age, ſo reſpectable in the Eaſt, pleaded in his behalf. One of the attendants went to the B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y, and told him an aged man, apparently miſerable, requeſted an audience.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Let him enter, replied Mourad; and the farmer proceeded, with trembling ſteps, over the rich carpet which beſpread the hall of the Divan, and approached the Bey, who reclined on a ſofa, embroidered with ſilk and gold. Crouding ſenſations deprived him of the uſe of ſpeech.</p>
            <p n="9">9. At laſt, after attentively looking, the voice of nature vanquiſhing fear, he fell, and embracing his knees, exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>You are my ſon!</hi> The Bey raiſed him, endeavored to recollect, and, after explanation, finding him to be his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, made him ſit down by his ſide, and careſſed him moſt affectionately.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The firſt guſh of nature over, the ſire deſcribed in what a deplorable ſtate he had left his mother, and breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and the prince propoſed to ſend for, and with them divide his riches and power, if they would embrace Iſlamiſm.</p>
            <p n="11">11. This the generous Chriſtian had foreſeen, and fearing youth might be dazzled, took not one of his ſons
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:026674_0134_0FD1563F899AADE0"/>
with him. He, therefore, firmly rejected Mourad's offer, and even remonſtrated with him on his own change of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The Bey, finding his father determined, and that his family's diſtreſs demanded immediate ſuccor, ſent him back to Syria, with a large ſum of money, and a veſſel load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with corn. The happy huſbandman immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to the plains of Damaſcus, where his arrival baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed miſery and tears from his homely roof, and brought joy, eaſe, and felicity.</p>

            <head>THE TEST OF GOODNESS.</head>
            <p>REAL goodneſs conſiſts in doing good to our enemies. Of this truth the following apologue may ſerve for an illuſtration. A certain father of a family, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years, being deſirous of ſettling his worldly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, divided his property between his three ſons.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nothing now remains, ſaid he to them, but a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond of great value; this I have determined to appropriate to whichever of you ſhall, within three months, perform the beſt actions.</p>
            <p n="3">3. His three ſons accordingly departed different ways, and returned by the limited time. On preſenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves before their judge, the eldeſt thus began.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Father, ſaid he, during my abſence, I found a ſtranger ſo circumſtanced, that he was under a neceſſity of entruſting me with the whole of his fortune.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He had no written ſecurity from me, nor could he poſſibly bring any proof, any evidence whatever of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſit. Yet I faithfully returned to him every ſhilling. Was there not ſomething commendable in this action?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thou haſt done what was incumbent upon thee to do, my ſon, replied the old man. The man who could have acted otherways were unworthy to live; for honeſty is a duty; thy action is an action of juſtice, not of goodneſs.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="138" facs="unknown:026674_0138_0FD15648F430F258"/>7. On this, the ſecond ſon advanced. In the courſe of my travels, ſaid he, I came to a lake in which I beheld a child ſtruggling with death; I plunged into it and ſaved his life in the preſence of a number of the neighboring villagers, all of whom can atteſt the truth of what I aſſert.</p>
            <p n="8">8. It was well done (interrupted the old man); you have only obeyed the dictates of humanity. At length the youngeſt of the three came forward.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I happened, ſaid he, to meet my mortal enemy, who having bewildered himſelf in the dead of night, had imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly fallen aſleep upon the brink of a frightful precipice. The leaſt motion would infallibly have plunged him head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long into the abyſs; and though his life was in my hands, yet with every neceſſary precaution, I awaked him, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him from his danger.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Ah, my ſon! exclaimed the venerable good man with tranſport, while he preſſed him to his heart; to thee belongs the diamond; well haſt thou deſerved it.</p>

            <head>DESCRIPTION OF MOUNT AETNA.</head>
            <p>THERE is no point on the ſurface of this globe, which unites ſo many awful and ſublime objects, as the ſummit of mount Aetna. The immenſe elevation from the ſurface of the earth, drawn as it were to a ſingle point, without any neighboring mountain for the ſenſes and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to reſt upon, and recover from their aſtoniſhment in their way down to the world:</p>
            <p n="2">2. This point or pinnacle, raiſed on the brink of a bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs gulph, as old as the world, often diſcharging rivers of fire, and throwing out burning rocks, with a noiſe which ſhakes the whole iſland:</p>
            <p n="3">3. Add to this, the unbounded extent of the proſpect, comprehending the greateſt diverſity, and the moſt beautiful ſcenery in nature; with the riſing ſun, advancing in the Eaſt, to illuminate the wondrous ſcene.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The whole atmoſphere by degrees kindled up, and ſhowed dimly and faintly the boundleſs proſpect around. Both ſea and land looked dark and confuſed, as if only
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:026674_0139_0FD1564AE5336448"/>
emerging from their original chaos; and light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeemed ſtill undivided; till the morning, by degrees advancing, completed the ſeparation.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſtars are extinguiſhed, and the ſhades diſappear. The foreſts, which but now ſeemed black and bottomleſs gulphs, from whence no ray was reflected to ſhow their form or colors, appear a new creation riſing to the ſight, catching life and beauty from every increaſing beam.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The ſcene ſtill enlarges, and the horizon ſeems to widen and expand itſelf on all ſides; till the ſun, like the great Creator, appears in the Eaſt, and with his plaſtic ray completes the mighty ſcene.</p>
            <p n="7">7. All appears enchantment; and it is with difficulty we can believe we are ſtill on earth. The ſenſes, unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to the ſublimity of ſuch a ſcene, are bewildered and confounded; and it is not till after ſome time, that they are capable of ſeparating and judging of the objects which compoſe it.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The body of the ſun is ſeen riſing from the ocean, immenſe tracts both of ſea and land intervening; the iſlands of Lipari, Panari, Alicudi, Strombolo, and Volca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, with their ſmoking ſummits, appear under your feet; and you look down on the whole of Sicily as on a map; and can trace every river through all its windings, from its ſource to its mouth.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The view is abſolutely boundleſs on every ſide; nor is there any one object within the circle of viſion, to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt it; ſo that the ſight is every where loſt in the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The circumference of the viſible horizon on the top of Aetna cannot be leſs than 2000 miles. At Malta, which is nearly 200 miles diſtant, they perceive all the ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions from the ſecond region; and that iſland is often diſcovered from about one half of the elevation of the mountain; ſo that at the whole elevation, the horizon muſt extend to nearly double that diſtance.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But this is by much too vaſt for our ſenſes, not intended to graſp ſo boundleſs a ſcene. I find by ſome of the Sicilian authors, that the African coaſt, as well as that of Nap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es, with many of its iſlands, has been diſcovered from the top of Aetna. Of this, however, we cannot boaſt, though we can very well believe it.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="140" facs="unknown:026674_0140_0FD1564C2FF7A5D8"/>12. But the moſt beautiful part of the ſcene is certainly the mountain itſelf, the iſland of Sicily, and the numerous iſlands lying round it. All theſe, by a kind of magic in viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, ſeem as if they were brought cloſe round the ſkirts of Aetna; the diſtances appearing reduced to nothing.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The preſent crater of the volcano is a circle of about three miles and a half in circumference. It goes ſhelving down on each ſide, and forms a regular hollow, like a vaſt amphitheatre.</p>
            <p n="14">14. From many places of this ſpace, iſſue volumes of ſmoke, which, being much heavier than the circumambient air, inſtead of riſing in it, as ſmoke generally does, rolls down the ſide of the mountain like a torrent, till coming to that part of the atmoſphere of the ſame ſpecific gravity with itſelf, it ſhoots off horizontally, and forms a large tract in the air, according to the direction of the wind.</p>
            <p n="15">15. The crater is ſo hot, that it is very dangerous, if not impoſſible to go down into it. Beſides, the ſmoke is very incommodious; and, in many places, the ſurface is ſo ſoft, that there have been inſtances of people's ſinking down into it, and paying for their temerity with their lives.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Near the centre of the crater is the great mouth of the volcano. And when we reflect on the immenſity of its depth, the vaſt caverns whence ſo many lavas have iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the force of its internal fire, ſufficient to raiſe up thoſe lavas to ſo great a height; the boiling of the matter, the ſhaking of the mountain, the exploſions of flaming rocks, &amp;c. we muſt allow, that the moſt enthuſiaſtic imagination, in the midſt of all its terrors, can hardly form an idea more dreadful.</p>

A large proportion of the audience, whoſe benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is at this moment liſtening to the ſpeaker of the day, like him were at that period too little advanced beyond the threſhold of life to partake of the divine enthuſiaſm which inſpired the American boſom; which prompted her voice to proclaim defiance to the thunders of Britain; which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated the banners of her armies; and finally erected the holy temple of American Liberty, over the tomb of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted tyranny.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is from thoſe who have already paſſed the meridian of life; it is from you, ye venerable aſſertors of the rights of mankind, that we are to be informed, what were the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which ſwayed within your breaſts, and impelled you to action; when, like the ſtripling of Iſrael, with ſcarce a weapon to attack, and without a ſhield for your defence, you met, and, undiſmayed, engaged with the gigantic great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Britiſh power.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Untutored in the diſgraceful ſcience of human butch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery; deſtitute of the fatal materials which the ingenuity of man has combined, to ſharpen the ſcythe of death; unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the arm of any friendly alliance, and unfortified againſt the powerful aſſaults of an unrelenting enemy, you did not heſitate at that moment, when your coaſts were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted by a formidable fleet, when your territories were invaded by a numerous and veteran army, to pronounce the ſentence of eternal ſeparation from Britain, and to throw the gauntlet at a power, the terror of whoſe recent triumphs was almoſt co-extenſive with the earth.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The intereſted and ſelfiſh propenſities, which, in times of proſperous tranquillity have ſuch powerful dominion over the heart, were all expelled, and in their ſtead, the public virtues, the ſpirit of perſonal devotion to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe, a contempt of every danger in compariſon with the ſubſerviency of the country, had aſſumed an unlimited control.</p>

of refulgence the twinkling ſplendor of every inferior plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et. Thoſe of you, my countrymen, who were actors in thoſe intereſting ſcenes, will beſt know, how feeble and impotent is the language of this deſcription to expreſs the impaſſioned emotions of the ſoul, with which you were then agitated.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Yet it were injuſtice to conclude from thence, or from the greater prevalence of private and perſonal motives in theſe days of calm ſerenity, that your ſons have degen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated from the virtues of their fathers.

            <head>ON KNOWING THE WORLD AT AN EARLY AGE.</head>
            <p>THE knowledge of the world, in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive ſenſe, is a knowledge greatly to be deſired. To underſtand the human heart, to know human manners, laws, languages, and inſtitutions of every kind, and in various na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to be able to reflect on all theſe with moral and political improvement, is an attainment worthy of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtateſman and the wiſeſt philoſopher.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="146" facs="unknown:026674_0146_0FD12B0D7A164510"/>2. But there is a knowledge of the world of a very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior kind, but which many parents value at a high price. Greek and Latin are always mentioned with contempt, on a compariſon with this. In compliance with cuſtom, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and to get him out of the way, the boy is placed at ſchool; but the knowledge to be gained there is little eſteemed by the empty votaries of faſhion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Men and things, not words, are magiſterially pointed out as the proper objects of ſtudy, by thoſe who know little of men, things, or words. It is not the knowledge of books, (ſay they) which he is to purſue, but the knowledge of the world; ignorant that the knowledge of books is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to gain a valuable knowledge of the world.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The parents, who give ſuch directions to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, are themſelves merely people of the world, as it is called; perſons for the moſt part of very moderate under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, who have never made any ſolid improvements in learning, and, conſequently, never felt its pleaſures, or its advantages.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They have perhaps raiſed themſelves by dint of worldly policy, by the little arts of ſimulation and diſſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation; and, having ſeen the effects of dreſs, addreſs, and an attention to exterior accompliſhments, but at the ſame time being totally unacquainted with real and ſolid attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they are naturally led to wiſh to give their children the moſt uſeful education, which, according to their ideas, is a knowledge of the world.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But what is this knowledge of the world? A knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of its follies and vices; a knowledge of them at a time of life, when they will not appear in their true light, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in themſelves, and the ſources of miſery; but flattering and pleaſurable. To ſee theſe at a boyiſh age, before the mind is properly prepared, will not cauſe an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence, but an imitation of them.</p>
            <p n="7">7. To introduce boys to ſcenes of immoral and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent behavior is to educate them in vice, and to give the young mind a foul ſtain, which it will never loſe. And yet I have known parents in the metropolis ſuffer boys of fourteen or fifteen to roam whereſoever they pleaſed; to frequent theatres, and other places of public diverſions, by themſelves; to return home late at night; and all this with
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:026674_0147_0FD1565DD5221860"/>
plenty of money, and without giving any account of the manner of conſuming that or their time.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The parents were pleaſed with their ſon's proficiency in the knowledge of the world; the ſon was pleaſed with liberty. All for a ſhort time, went on to their mutual ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction. But after a few years, a ſad reverſe uſually ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. The boy became a ſpendthrift and a debauchee; alienated his father's affections by incurring debt, and ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his conſtitution by every ſpecies of exceſs.</p>
            <p n="9">9. What remained after his money and his health were diſſipated? No learning, no reliſh for the works of literary taſte. The ſpring of life, when the ſeeds of theſe ſhould have been ſown, was employed in another manner. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing remained but a wretched and a painful old age, devoted to cards, dice, and illiberal conviviality.</p>
            <p n="10">10. He, who is attending to his books, and collecting ideas which will one day render him a bleſſing and an hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to all with whom he is connected, will appear dull, awk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and unengaging to many, in compariſon with the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="2">2. She was but twelve years old, when Captain Smith, the braveſt, the moſt intelligent, and the moſt humane of the firſt coloniſts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll into the hands of the ſavages. He already underſtood their language, had traded with them ſeveral times, and often appeaſed the quarrels between the Europeans and them. Often had he been obliged alſo to fight them, and to puniſh their perfidy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. At length, however, under the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of commerce, he was drawn into an ambuſh, and the only two compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions who accompanied him, fell before his eyes; but though alone, by his dexterity he extricated himſelf from the troop which ſurrounded him; until, unfortunately, ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining he could ſave himſelf by croſſing a moraſs, he ſtuck faſt, ſo that the ſavages, againſt whom he had no means of defending himſelf, at laſt took and bound him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to Powhatan.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The king was ſo proud of having Captain Smith in his power, that he ſent him in triumph to all the tributary princes, and ordered that he ſhould be ſplendidly treated, till he returned to ſuffer that death which was prepared for him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fatal moment at laſt arrived. Captain Smith was laid upon the hearth of the ſavage king, and his head placed upon a large ſtone to receive the ſtroke of death; when Pocahontas, the youngeſt and darling daughter of
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:026674_0149_0FD156609ED07D20"/>
Powhatan, threw herſelf upon his body, claſped him in her arms, and declared, that if the cruel ſentence was execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the firſt blow ſhould fall on her.</p>
            <p n="6">6. All ſavages (abſolute ſovereigns and tyrants not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted) are invariably more affected by the tears of infancy, than the voice of humanity. Powhatan could not reſiſt the tears and prayers of his daughter.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Captain Smith obtained his life, on condition of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his ranſom a certain quantity of muſkets, powder, and iron utenſils; but how were they to be obtained? They would neither permit him to return to James-Town, nor let the Engliſh know where he was, leſt they ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand him ſword in hand.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Captain Smith, who was as ſenſible as courageous, ſaid, that if Powhatan would permit one of his ſubjects to carry to James Town a leaf which he took from his pocket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, he ſhould find under a tree, at the day and hour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, all the articles demanded for his ranſom.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Powhatan conſented; but without having much faith in his pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>miſes, believing it to be only an artifice of the Captain to prolong his life. But he had written on the leaf a few lines, ſufficient to give an account of his ſituation. The meſſenger returned. The king ſent to the place fixed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and was greatly aſtoniſhed to find every thing which had been demanded.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Powhatan could not conceive this mode of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting thoughts; and Captain Smith was henceforth look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as a great magician, to whom they could not ſhow too much reſpect. He left the ſavages in this opinion, and haſtened to return home.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Two or three years after, ſome freſh differences ariſing amidſt them and the Engliſh, Powhatan, who no longer though<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="12">12. The night of this intended conſpiracy, Pocahontas took advantage of the obſcurity; and in a terrible ſtorm which kept the ſavages in their tents, eſcaped from her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe, adviſed the Engliſh to be on their guard, but conjured them to ſpare her family; to appear ignorant of

the intelligence ſhe had given, and terminate all their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences by a new treaty.</p>
            <p n="13">13. It would be tedious to relate all the ſervices which this angel of peace rendered to both nations. I ſhall only add, that the Engliſh, I know not from what motives, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nd the only conſolation ſhe had was Captain Smith, in whom ſhe found a ſecond father.</p>
            <p n="14">14. She was treated with great reſpect, and married to a planter by the name of Rolfe, who ſoon after took her to England. This was in the reign of James the Firſt; and it is ſaid, that this monarch, pedantic and ridiculous in every point, was ſo infatuated with the prerogatives of royalty, that he expreſſed his diſpleaſure, that one of his ſubjects ſhould dare to marry the daughter even of a ſavage king.</p>
            <p n="15">15. It will not perhaps be difficult to decide on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, whether it was the ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>lf to a level with the chief of the ſavages.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Be that as it will, Captain Smith, who had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to London before the arrival of Pocahontas, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely happy to ſee her again; but dared not treat her with the ſame familiarity as at James-Town. As ſoon as ſhe ſaw him, ſhe threw herſelf into his arms, calling him her father; but finding that he neither returned her careſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es with equal warmth, nor the endearing title of daughter, ſhe turned aſide her head and wept bitterly; and it was a long time before they could obtain a ſingle word from her.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Captain Smith inquired ſeveral times what could be the cauſe of her affliction. "What! ſaid ſhe, did I not ſave thy life in America? When I was torn from the arms of my father, and conducted amongſt thy friends, didſt thou not promiſe to be a father to me? Did<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="18">18. It was not difficult for the Captain to make his peace with this charming creature, whom he tenderly loved.
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:026674_0151_0FD156682EC82E58"/>
He preſented her to ſeveral people of the firſt quality; but never dared to take her to court, from which, however, ſhe received ſeveral favors.</p>

After a reſidence of ſeveral years in England, an example of virtue and piety, and attachment to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhe died, as ſhe was on the point of embarking for America.

            <head>FRATERNAL AFFECTION.</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of the ſixteenth century, the Portugueſe carracks failed from Liſbon to Goa, a very great, rich, and flouriſhing colony of that nation in the Eaſt-Indies. There were no leſs than twelve hundred ſouls, mariners, paſſengers, prieſts, and friars, on board one of theſe veſſels.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The beginning of their voyage was proſperous; they had doubled the ſouthern extremity of the great continent of Africa, called the Cape of Good Hope, and were ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their courſe Northeaſt, to the great continent of India, when ſome gentlemen on board, who, having ſtudied geog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphy and navigation, found in the latitude in which they were then ſailing, a large ridge of rocks laid down in their ſea-charts.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="154" facs="unknown:026674_0154_0FD1566D493DD840"/>3. They no ſooner made this diſcovery, than they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted the captain of the ſhip with the affair, deſiring him to communicate the ſame to the pilot; which requeſt he immediately granted, recommended him to lie by in the night, and ſlacken ſail by day, until they ſhould be paſt the danger.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a cuſtom always among the Portugueſe abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely to commit the ſailing part, or the navigation of the veſſel to the pilot, who is anſwerable with his head for the ſafe conduct or carriage of the king's ſhips, or thoſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to private traders; and he is under no manner of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the captain, who commands in every other reſpect.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The pilot being one of thoſe ſelf-ſufficient men, who think every hint given them from others in the way of their profeſſion derogatory from their underſtandings, took as an affront to be taught his art, and inſtead of complying with the captain's requeſt, actually crowded more ſail than the veſſel had carried before.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They had not ſailed many hours, when, juſt about the dawn of day, a terrible diſaſter befel them, which would have been prevented if they had lain by. The ſhip ſtruck upon a rock. I leave to the reader's imagination, what a ſcene of horror this dreadful accident muſt occaſion among twelve hundred perſons, all in the ſame inevitable danger; beholding, with fearful aſtoniſhment, that inſtantaneous death which now ſtared them in the face.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In this diſtreſs, the captain ordered the pinnace to be launched, into which, having toſſed a ſmall quantity of biſcuit, and ſome boxes of marmalade, he jumped in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, with nineteen others, who, with their ſwords, prevented the coming in of any more, leſt the boat ſhould ſink.</p>
            <p n="8">8. In this condition they put off into the great Indian ocean, without a compaſs to ſteer by, or any freſh water but what might fall f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> they had rowed four days in this miſerable condition, the captain, who had been for ſome time very ſick and weak, died.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This added, if poſſible, to their miſery; for as they now fell into confuſion, every one would govern, and none would obey. This obliged them to elect one of their own
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:026674_0155_0FD1566EA0429350"/>
company to command them, whoſe orders they implicitly agreed to follow. This perſon propoſed to the company to draw lots, and to caſt every fourth man overboard; as their ſmall ſtock of proviſions was ſo far ſpent, as not to be able at a very ſhort allowance to ſuſtain life above three days longer.</p>
            <p n="10">10. They were now nineteen perſons in all; in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were a friar and a carpenter, both of whom they would exempt, as the one was uſeful to abſolve and comfort them in their laſt extremity, and the other to repair the pinnace in caſe of a leak or other accident.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The ſame compliment they paid to their new cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he being the odd man, and his life of much conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. He refuſed their indulgence a great while; but at laſt they obliged him to acquieſce; ſo that there were four to die out of the ſixteen remaining perſons.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The three firſt ſubmitted to their fate. The fourth was a Portugueſe gentleman who had a younger brother in the boat, who, ſeeing him about to be thrown overboard, moſt tenderly embraced him, and with tears in his eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to let him die in his room; enforcing his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments by telling him that he was a married man, and had a wife and children at Goa, beſides the care of three ſiſters, who abſolutely depended upon him; that, as for himſelf, he was ſingle, and his life of no great importance; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conjured him to ſuffer him to ſupply his place.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The elder brother, aſtoniſhed, and melting with this generoſity, replied, that, ſince the divine providence had appointed him to ſuffer, it would be wicked and unjuſt to permit any other to die for him, eſpecially a brother, to whom he was ſo infinitely obliged. The younger, perſiſting in his purpoſe, would take no denial; but throwing himſelf on his knees, held his brother ſo faſt, that the company could not diſengage them.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Thus they diſputed for a while, the elder brother bidding him to be a father to his children, and recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his wife to his protection; and as he would inherit his eſtate, to take care of their common ſiſters; but all he could ſay could not make the younger deſiſt. This was a ſcene of tenderneſs that muſt fill every breaſt, ſuſceptible of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous impreſſions, with pity. At laſt the conſtancy of the elder brother yielded to the piety of the other.</p>
            <p n="15">
               <pb n="156" facs="unknown:026674_0156_0FD1567174689C58"/>15. He acquieſced, and ſuffered the gallant youth to ſupply his place, who being caſt into the ſea, and a good ſwimmer, ſoon got to the ſtern of the pinnace, and laid hold of the rudder with his right hand, which being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by one of the ſailors, he cut off the hand with his ſword; then dropping into the ſea, he preſently caught hold again with his left, which received the ſame fate by a ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond blow.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Thus diſmembered of both hands, he made a ſhift, notwithſtanding, to keep himſelf above water with his feet and two ſtumps, which he held bleeding upwards.</p>
            <p n="17">17. This moving ſpectacle ſo raiſed the pity of the whole company, that they cried out, "He is but one man, let us endeavor to ſave his life;" and he was accordingly taken into the boat, where he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ad his hands bound up as well as the place and circumſtances could permit.</p>
            <p n="18">18. They rowed all that night; and the next morning, when the ſun aroſe, as if Heaven would reward the piety of this young man, they deſcried land, which proved to be the mountains of Mozambique, in Africa, not far from a Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe colony. Thither they all ſafely arrived, where they remained until the next ſhip from Liſbon paſſed by and carried them to Goa.</p>

            <head>ON THE IMPORTANCE OF STUDYING THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE GRAMMATICALLY.</head>
            <p>A RIGHT education of children has ever been eſteemed by the beſt philoſophers and wiſeſt legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, as the moſt certain ſource of happineſs, not only to families, but to ſtates and kingdoms; and is, on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="2">2. Of ſuch ineſtimable worth was right education held by the ancients, that when they were in all their glory, and long after, the tutorage of youth was accounted the moſt honorable employment; and many of noble birth and eaſy
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:026674_0157_0FD156742F831600"/>
fortunes became preceptors, and took youth under their tuition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is well known that the Romans, as well as Greeks, carefully applied themſelves to the ſtudy of their own lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and were early able to ſpeak and write it in the greateſt perfection. Maſters taught them, betimes, the principles, the difficulties, the ſubtilties and the depths of it. And to that it was chiefly owing, that they made more early advances in the moſt uſeful ſciences, than any youth have ſince done.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The French have been beforehand with us in this important particular. They have long imitated the Greeks and Romans, and have had the good policy to prefer their own language to every other; diſdaining the ſtudy of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign tongues, unleſs driven by neceſſity into other countries. And the political advantages they have derived from ſuch a conduct are viſible all over Europe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Policy then, were there nothing elſe, cries aloud for our exerting ourſelves in the cauſe of a too long neglected Engliſh education; and for wiping off that charge of bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity, with which not only we, but thoſe of England, have been, on that account, ſo long ſtigmatized by the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whom we ſo much venerate, and whoſe language we are ſo ridiculouſly fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d of, to the reproach and degradation of a better, even our own.</p>
            <p n="6">6. There is, perhaps, no language the grammatical knowledge of which can be learned with ſo much eaſe, or with leſs difficulty than ours. And as the freedom, the liberty, and the life of our country depend upon it, ſhall America deprive her ſons of this moſt valuable birthright, the right of nature?</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is to me the moſt unaccountable thing I ever heard, that maſters, and thoſe who ſuperintend public ſchools, ſhould neglect this important part of an education, and ſuffer youth to trifle away their time, when it might be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to ſo much advantage to themſelves and to future generations. And what is ſtill more ſo, is, that parents, who love their children, ſhould connive at this unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neglect.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Without a common ſchool education, which is the anchor of liberty, the ſupporter of our rights, we can be
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:026674_0158_0FD1567622F445D0"/>
compared to nothing but a ſhip at ſea, deprived of ſails, rudder, compaſs, and expoſed to the billows and hurricanes of the boiſterous deep.</p>
            <p n="9">9. With it, we have a moſt ſubſtantial foundation laid, on which we can erect a ſuperb building, for public and private utility: with it, we can conduct the ſhip of ſtate, and regale ourſelves under the tree of liberty; and unſhackle ourſelves from ignorance, which is the origin of feuds and animoſities in free ſtates.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Do not the arts and ſciences, in every kingdom, participate to a great degree the ſate of its language? riſe and flouriſh, or ſink into diſrepute, as the latter is cultivated or neglected? How dear then ought the honor of the Engliſh language to be to every American!</p>
            <p n="11">11. And, as grammar is the ſolid foundation on which all other ſcience reſts, and as all human inquiry is divided into ſcience and language; and further, as under the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, fall the ideas and ſubjects of the didactic ſtyle, oratory, poetry, painting, and ſculpture, judge ye, if it ought to be left to young gentlemen to form their ſtyle by chance, or to begin the ſtudy of their mother tongue, at a time of life which calls them forth to action.</p>
            <p n="12">12. You, who are entruſted with the education of our youth, and you, who ſuperintend our ſchools, have a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and joyful proſpect before you, a noble opportunity in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of doing much good to mankind; of conſtituting real merit, and ſecuring the warmeſt returns of gratitude, by perfecting the flower of our youth, in ſpeaking and writing that language, in which alone they muſt act the part of their fathers, ſerve their country, and become the mouths of the people.</p>
            <p n="13">13. You will not fail, my beloved countrymen, to afford your children this diſtinguiſhing, this neceſſary, this all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant education, by which you will, in a ſhort time, nurſe up a race of freemen, to the honor and never fading glory of our country.</p>
            <p n="14">14. America will then increaſe in wealth, in commerce, agriculture and manufactures; will as far ſurpaſs all other nations on the globe, in virtue, learning and abilities; and will as much diſtinguiſh herſelf for humanity, nobleneſs of ſentiment, attachment to government, and love of liberty,

Thence he naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that the lion only waited for the approach of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in order to make him a prey; and in the mean time, could not expect any other than to ſerve for this fierce an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imal's ſupper, inaſmuch as he had no other weapon of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence than a ſtick, and knew that he could not get home before it was dark.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But as he was well acquainted with the nature of the lion, and the manner of its ſeizing upon its prey; and at the ſame time had leiſure to ruminate on the ways and means in which it was moſt likely that his exiſtence would be terminated, he at length hit on a method of ſaving his life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. For this purpoſe, inſtead of making the beſt of his way home, he looked out for a precipice; and ſetting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down on the edge of it, found to his great joy, that the lion likewiſe made a halt, and kept at the ſame diſtance as before.</p>

            <head>NARRATIVE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY ADVENTURES OF FOUR SAILORS, WHO WERE CAST AWAY ON THE DESERT ISLAND OF SPITSBERGEN.</head>
            <p>THESE northern ſeas, owing to the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive cold of the climate, are frequently ſo full of ice as to render it exceedingly hazardous to ſhips, which are thereby expoſed to the danger of being cruſhed between two bodies of immenſe ice, or of being ſo completely ſurrounded, as to deprive them of every power of moving from the ſpot.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In this latter alarming ſituation were the crew of a Ruſſian ſhip. A council was immediately held, when the mate mentioned what he recollected to have heard, that a ſhip's crew from Meſen, ſome time before, had formed a reſolution of paſſing the winter upon this iſland, and for that purpoſe had carried timber proper for building a hut at a little diſtance from the ſhore.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This information led the whole company to form the reſolution of wintering there, ſhould the hut be fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately remaining. They were induced to adopt this meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure from the certainty of periſhing ſhould they remain in the ſhip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> They therefore deputized four of their crew to go in ſearch of the hut, and make what further diſcoveries they could.</p>
            <p n="4">4. As no human creature inhabited the ſhore on which they were to land, it was abſolutely neceſſary for them to carry ſome proviſions with them for their ſupport. They had to make their way, for nearly two miles, over looſe heaps of ice, which the water had raiſed, and the wind had driven againſt each other; and this made it equally difficult and dangerous.</p>
            <p n="5">5. From this conſideration, they avoided loading them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too much with proviſions, leſt their weight might ſink them between the pieces of ice, where they muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably periſh.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Having previouſly conſidered all theſe matters, they provided themſelves only with a muſket and powder-horn, containing twelve charges of powder and ball, an axe, a ſmall kettle, a bag with about twenty pounds of flour, a
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:026674_0164_0FD156834F2ED740"/>
knife, a tinder-box and tinder, a bladder filled with tobac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co, and every man his wooden pipe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Thus poorly equipped, theſe four ſailors reached the iſland, little thinking what they were to endure while they remained on it. After exploring ſome ſmall part of the country, they diſcovered the hut they were in purſuit of, at the diſtance of about an Engliſh mile and a half from the ſhore.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Its length was thirty-ſix feet, and its height and breadth eighteen. It conſiſted of a ſmall antichamber about twelve feet broad, having two doors, the one to exclude the outer air, and the other to form a communication with the inner room. This contributed not a little to keep the larger room warm, when it was once heated.</p>
            <p n="9">9. They found in the larger room an earthen ſtove, conſtructed in the Ruffian manner. They rejoiced exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly at this diſcovery, though they found the hut had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered very much from the ſeverity of the weather, it having been built a conſiderable time. However, they contrived to make it ſupportable for that night.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The next morning early they repaired to the ſhore; in order to acquaint their comrades with their ſucceſs, and alſo to get from the veſſel ſuch proviſions, ammunition, and other neceſſaries, as might in ſome meaſure enable them to ſtruggle with the approaching winter.</p>
            <p n="11">11. But what pen can properly deſcribe the terrible ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of their minds, when, coming to the place at which they landed, they diſcovered nothing but an open ſea, clear of all ice, though, but a day before, it had covered the ocean! During the night, a violent ſtorm had ariſen, which had been the cauſe of this change of appearance in the ocean.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Whether the ice, which had before ſurrounded the veſſel, being put in motion by the violence of the winds and waves, had cruſhed the ſhip to pieces, or whether ſhe had been carried by the current into the main ocean, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to determine.</p>
            <p n="13">13. However, they ſaw the ſhip no more; and as ſhe was never afterwards heard of, it is moſt likely that ſhe went to the bottom with every ſoul on board. This dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:026674_0165_0FD1568398EFF8E0"/>
event deprived the poor unhappy wretches of all hopes of ever again ſeeing their native country.</p>
            <p n="14">14. They returned to their hut, and there bewailed their deplorable lot, more perhaps to be pitied than thoſe who were buried in the boſom of the deep. Their thoughts were, in courſe, firſt directed to procure ſubſiſtence, and to repair their hut.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Their twelve charges of powder and ſhot ſoon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them as many rein-deer, of which there fortunately happened to be many on the iſland. They then ſet about repairing their hut, and filled up all the crevices, through which the air found its way, with the moſs that grew there in plenty.</p>
            <p n="16">16. As it was impoſſible to live in that climate without fire, and as no wood grew upon the iſland, they were much alarmed on that account. However, in their wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings over the beach, they met with plenty of wood, which had been driven on ſhore by the waves.</p>
            <p n="17">17. This principally conſiſted of the wrecks of ſhips; but ſometimes whole trees with their roots came on ſhore, the undoubted produce of ſome more hoſpitable clime, which were waſhed from their native ſoil by the overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of rivers, or ſome other accident.</p>
            <p n="18">18. As ſoon as their powder and ſhot were exhauſted, they began to be in dread of periſhing with hunger; but good fortune, and their own ingenuity, to which neceſſity always gives a ſpur, removed theſe dreadful apprehenſions. In the courſe of their traverſing the beach, they one day diſcovered ſome boards, in which were large hooks and nails in abundance.</p>
            <p n="19">19. By the aſſiſtance of theſe, they made ſpears and arrows<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, from a yew tree, which had been thrown on ſhore by the waves, they formed plenty of bows. With theſe weapons, during the time of their continuance on the iſland, they killed upwards of two hundred and fifty rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deer, bende a great number of blue and white foxes.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The fleſh of theſe animals ſerved them for food, and their ſkins were equally uſeful in ſupplying them with warm cloathing. The number of white bears they killed were only ten; for theſe animals being very ſtrong, defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with great vigor and fury, and even ventured
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:026674_0166_0FD156846139F758"/>
to make their appearance frequently at the door of their hut, from whence they were driven with ſome difficulty and danger.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Thus theſe three different ſorts of animals were the only food of theſe miſerable mariners, during their long and dreary abode on this iſland.</p>
            <p n="22">22. The intenſeneſs of the cold, and the want of prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conveniences, rendered it impoſſible for them to cook their victuals properly, ſo that they were obliged to eat their proviſions almoſt raw, and without bread or ſalt.</p>
            <p n="23">23. There was but one ſtove in the hut, and that being in the Ruſſian manner, was not proper for boiling. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to remedy this inconvenience as much as poſſible, they dried ſome of their proviſions, during the ſummer, in the open air, and then hung them up in the upper part of the hut, which being continually filled with ſmoke, they thus became thoroughly dried.</p>
            <p n="24">24. This they uſed inſtead of bread, which made them reliſh their half boiled meat the better. They pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured their water in ſummer from the rivulets that fell from the rocks; and in the winter, from ſnow and ice thawed. This was their only drink; and their ſmall ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle was the only convenience they had to make uſe of for this and many other purpoſes.</p>
            <p n="25">25. As it was neceſſary to keep up a continual fire, they were particularly cautious not to let the light be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed; for, though they had both ſteel and flints, yet they had no tinder; and it would have been a terrible thing to be without light in a climate where darkneſs reigns ſo many months during winter.</p>
            <p n="26">26. They therefore faſhioned a kind of lamp, which they filled with rein-deer fat, and ſtuck into it ſome twiſted linen, ſhaped in the form of a wick. After many trials, they at laſt brought their lamp to complete perfection, and kept it burning, without intermiſſion, from the day they firſt made it, till they embarked for their native country.</p>
            <p n="27">27. They alſo found themſelves in want of ſhoes, boots, and other neceſſary articles of dreſs, for all which they found wonderful reſources in that genius to which neceſſity gives birth.</p>
            <p n="28">
               <pb n="167" facs="unknown:026674_0167_0FD15687D3CB98B0"/>28. Having lived more than ſix years upon this dreary and inhoſpitable iſland, a ſhip happened to arrive there, which took three of them on board, and carried them back to their native country. The fourth man was ſeized with the ſcurvy, and being naturally indolent, and not uſing proper exerciſe, he died, after lingering for ſome time, when his companions buried him in the ſnow.</p>

            <head>SPEECH OF CANULEIUS, A ROMAN TRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BUNE, TO THE CONSULS, IN BEHALF OF THE PLEBEIANS.</head>
            <p>WHAT an inſult upon us is this! If we are not ſo rich as the patricians, are we not citizens of Rome as well as they? inhabitants of the ſame country? members of the ſame community? The nations bordering upon Rome, and even ſtrangers more remote, are admitted not only to marriages with us, but to what is of much greater importance, the freedom of the city.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are we, becauſe we are commoners, to be worſe treated than ſtrangers? And, when we demand that the people may be free to beſtow their offices and dignities on whom they pleaſe, do we aſk any thing unreaſonable or new? Do we claim more than their original inherent right? What occaſion, then, for all this uproar, as if the univerſe was falling to ruin? They were juſt going to lay violent hands upon me in the ſenate-houſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What! muſt this empire, then, be unavoidably over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned? Muſt Rome of neceſſity ſink at once, if a plebeian, worthy of the office, ſhould be raiſed to the conſulſhip? The patricians, I am perſuaded, if they could, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive you of the common light. It certainly offends them that you breathe, that you ſpeak, that you have the ſhapes of men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Nay, but to make a commoner a conſul, would be, ſay they, a moſt enormous thing. Numa Pompilius, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without being ſo much as a Roman citizen, was made king of Rome. The elder Tarquin, by birth not even Ital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian, was nevertheleſs placed upon the throne. Servius Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:026674_0168_0FD15689B6E26658"/>
the ſon of a captive woman, (nobody knows who his father was) has obtained the kingdom as the reward of his wiſdom and virtue.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In thoſe days, no man in whom virtue ſhone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous was rejected or deſpiſed on account of his race and deſcent. And did the ſtate proſper the leſs for that? Were not theſe ſtrangers the very beſt of all our kings? And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing now, that a plebeian ſhould have their talents and merit, muſt not he be ſuffered to govern us?</p>
            <p n="6">6. But, "we find that, upon the abolition of the regal power, no commoner was choſen to the conſulate." And what of that? Before Numa's time, there were no pontiffs in Rome. Before Servius Tullius' days, there was no cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, no diviſion of the people into claſſes and centuries. Who ever heard of conſuls before the expulſion of Tarquin the proud? Dictators, we all know, are of modern inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and ſo are the offices of tribunes, aedilles, quaeſtors.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Within theſe ten years we have made decemvirs, and we have unmade them. Is nothing to be done but what has been done before? That very law forbidding marriages of patricians with plebeians, is not that a new thing? Was there any ſuch law before the decemvirs enacted it? and a moſt ſhameful one it is in a free ſtate. Such marriages, it ſeems, would taint the pure blood of the nobility.</p>
            <p n="8">8. They talk to us of the confuſion there will be in families<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if this ſtatute ſhould be repealed. I wonder they do not mak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>DESCRIPTION OF THE FALLS OF NIAGARA.</head>
            <p>AMONG the many natural curioſities which this country affords, the cataract of Niagara is infinitely the greateſt. In order to have a tolerable idea of this ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendous fall of water, it will be neceſſary to conceive that part of the country in which Lake Erie is ſituated, to be el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evated above that which contains Lake Ontario, about three hundred feet.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſlope which ſeparates the upper and lower coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, is generally very ſteep, and in many places almoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular. It is formed by horizontal ſtrata of ſtone, great part of which is what we commonly call lime-ſtone. The ſlope may be traced from the north ſide of Lake Onta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio, near the bay of Taronto, round the weſt end of the lake; thence its direction is generally eaſt, between Lake Ontario and Lake Erie; it croſſes the ſtrait of Niagara, and the Cheneſeco river, after which it becomes loſt in the country towards the Seneca Lake.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="170" facs="unknown:026674_0170_0FD1568E69E5B158"/>3. It is to this ſlope that our country is indebted, both for the cataract of Niagara, and the great falls of the Chen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſeco. The cataract of Niagara was formerly down at the northern ſide of the ſlope, near to that place which is now known by the name of the Landing; but from the great length of time, added to the great quantity of water, and diſtance which it falls, the ſolid ſtone is worn away, for about ſeven miles, up towards Lake Erie, and a chaſm is formed which no perſon can approach without horror.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Down this chaſm the water ruſhes with a moſt aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing velocity, after it makes the great pitch. In going up the road near this chaſm, the fancy is conſtantly engaged in the contemplation of the moſt romantic and awful proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects imaginable, until, at length, the eye catches the falls; the imagination is inſtantly arreſted, and you admire in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence! The river is about one hundred and thirty-five poles wide, at the falls, and the perpendicular pitch one hundred and fifty feet.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The fall of this vaſt body of water produces a ſound, which is frequently heard at the diſtance of twenty miles, and a ſenſible tremulous motion in the earth for ſome poles round. A heavy fog, or cloud, is conſtantly aſcending from the falls, in which rainbows may always be ſeen, when the ſun ſhines.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This fog, or ſpray, in the winter ſeaſon, falls upon the neighboring trees, where it congeals, and produces a moſt beautiful chryſtalline appearance. This remark is equally applicable to the falls of the Cheneſeco.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The difficulty which would attend levelling the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids in the chaſm, prevented my attempting it; but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture the water muſt deſcend at leaſt ſixty-five feet. The perpendicular pitch at the cataract is one hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty feet; to theſe add fifty-eight feet, which the water falls in the laſt half mile, immediately above the falls, and we have two hundred and ſeventy-three feet, which the water falls, in a diſtance of about ſeven miles and a half.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If either ducks, or geeſe, inadvertently, alight in the rapids, above the great cataract, they are incapable of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the wing again, and are inſtantly hurried on to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. There is one appearance at this cataract, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſome attention, and which I do not remember to have ſeen noted by any writer.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="171" facs="unknown:026674_0171_0FD156944D20E2B8"/>9. Juſt below the great pitch, the water and foam may be ſeen puffed up in ſpherical figures, nearly as large as common cocks of hay; they burſt at the top, and project a column of ſpray to a prodigious height; they then ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, and are ſucceeded by others, which burſt in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. This appearance is moſt conſpicuous about half way between the iſland, that divides the falls, and the weſt ſide of the ſtrait, where the largeſt column of water deſcends.</p>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ENT AFFECTIONS.</head>
            <p>BENEVOLENCE, from its nature, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the mind, warms the heart, enlivens the whole frame, and brightens every feature of the countenance. It may juſtly be ſaid to be medicinal both to ſoul and body. We are bound to it by duty; we are invited to it by intereſt; and becauſe both theſe cords are often feeble, we have nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural kind affections to aid them in their operations, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their defects; and theſe affections are joined with a manly pleaſure in their exertion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are amiable even in brute animals. We love the meekneſs of the lamb, the gentleneſs of the dove, the affection of a dog to his maſter. We cannot, without pleaſure, obſerve the timid ewe, who never ſhowed the leaſt degree of courage in her own defence, become valiant and intrepid in defence of her lamb, and boldly aſſault thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, the very ſight of whom was wont to put her to flight.</p>
            <p n="3">3. How pleaſant is it to ſee the family economy of a pair of little birds, in rearing their tender offspring; the conjugal affection and fidelity of the parents; their cheerful toil and induſtry in providing food to their family; their ſagacity in concealing their habitation; the arts they uſe, often at the peril of their own lives, to decoy hawks and other enemies from their dwelling-place; and the afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they feel, when ſome unlucky boy has robbed them of the dear pledges of their affection, and fruſtrated all their hopes of their riſing family?</p>
            <p n="4">4. If kind affection be amiable in brutes, it is not leſs ſo in our own ſpecies. Even the external ſigns of it have
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:026674_0172_0FD1569620BB8828"/>
a powerful charm. Every one knows that a perſon of accompliſhed good breeding, charms every one he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſes with. And what is this good breeding? If we ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize it, we ſhall find it to be made up of looks, geſtures and ſpeeches, which are the natural ſigns of benevolence and good affection.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He who has the habit of uſing theſe ſigns with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and without meanneſs, is well bred and polite. What is that in the features of the face, which all men ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire? I believe it conſiſts chiefly in the features which indicate good affections.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Every indication of meekneſs, gentleneſs, and benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is a beauty. On the contrary, every feature that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates pride, paſſion, envy, and malignity, is a deformity. Kind affections, therefore, are amiable in brutes. Even the ſigns and ſhadows of them are highly attract<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e in our own ſpecies.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Indeed they are the joy and the comfort of human life, not to good men only, but even to the vicious and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute. Without ſociety, and the intercourſe of affection, man is a gloomy, melancholy, and joyleſs being.</p>
            <p n="8">8. His mind oppreſſed with cares and fears, he cannot enjoy the balm of ſound ſleep. In conſtant dread of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending danger, he ſtarts at the ruſtling of a leaf. His ears are continually upon the ſtretch, and every zephyr brings ſome ſound that alarms him.</p>
            <p n="9">9. When he enters into ſociety, and feels ſecurity in the good affection of friends and neighbors, it is then only that his fear vaniſhes, and his mind is at eaſe. His courage is raiſed, his underſtanding is enlightened, and his heart di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates with joy.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Human ſociety may be compared to a heap of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, which, when placed aſunder, can retain neither their light nor heat, amidſt the ſurrounding elements; but when brought together, they mutually give heat and light to each other; the flame breaks forth, and not only defends itſelf, but ſubdues every thing around it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The ſecurity, the happineſs, and the ſtrength of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſociety, ſpring ſolely from the reciprocal benevolent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of its members. The benevolent affections, though they be all honorable and lovely, are not all equally ſo.
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:026674_0173_0FD156986D8A5340"/>
There is a ſubordination among them; and the honor we pay to them generally correſponds to the extent of their object.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The good huſband, the good father, the good friend, the good neighbor, we honor as a good man, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of our love and affection. But the man in whom theſe more private affections are ſwallowed up in zeal for the good of his country, and of mankind, who goes about doing good, and ſeeks opportunities of being uſeful to his ſpecies, we revere as more than a good man; we eſteem him as a hero.</p>

            <head>NARRATIVE OF THE CAPTIVITY OF MRS. JEMIMA HOWE, TAKEN BY THE INDIANS AT HINS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DALE, NEW-HAMPSHIRE,
<date>JULY 27, 1755.</date>
            </head>
            <p>AS Meſſrs. Caleb Howe, Hilkiah Grou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and Benjamin Gaffield, who had been hoeing corn in the meadow, weſt of the river, were returning home a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſunſet, to a place called Bridgman's Fort, they were fired upon by twelve Indian<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, who had ambuſhed their path.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Howe was on horſeback, with two young lads, his children, behind him. A ball, which broke his thigh, brought him to the ground. His horſe ran a few rods and fell likewiſe, and both the lads were taken. The Indians in their ſavage manner, coming up to Howe, pierced his body with a ſpear, tore off his ſcalp, ſtuck a hatchet in his head, and left him in this forlorn condition.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He was found alive the morning after, by a party of men from Fort Hinſdale; and being aſked by one of the party whether he knew him, he anſwered, Yes, I know you all. Theſe were his laſt words, though he did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire until after his friends had arrived with him at Fort Hinſdale. Grout was ſo fortunate as to eſcape unhurt.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But Gaffield, in attempting to wade through the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, at a certain place which was indeed fordable at that time, was unfortunately drowned. Fluſhed with the ſucceſs they had met with here, the ſavages went directly to Bridgman's Fort. There was no man in it, and only three women and ſome children, Mrs. Jemima Howe, Mrs. Submit Grout, and Mrs. Eunice Gaffield.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Their huſbands I need not mention again, and their feelings at this juncture I will not attempt to deſcribe. They had heard the enemies' guns, but knew not what had happened to their friends.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Extremely anxious for their ſafety, they ſtood long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to embrace them, until at length, concluding from the noiſe they heard without that ſome of them were come, they unbarred the gate in a hurry to receive them; when lo! to their inexpreſſible diſappointment and ſurpriſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of their huſbands, in ruſhed a number of hideous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:026674_0177_0FD156A0F199E810"/>
to whom they and their tender offspring became an eaſy prey; and from whom they had nothing to expect, but either an immediate death, or a long and doleful captivity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The latter of theſe, by the favor of Providence, turned out to be the lot of theſe unhappy women, and their ſtill more unhappy, becauſe more helpleſs children. Mrs. Gaffield had but one, Mrs. Grout had three, and Mrs. Howe ſeven. The eldeſt of Mrs. Howe's was eleven years old, and the youngeſt but ſix months.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The two eldeſt were daughters, which ſhe had by her firſt huſband, Mr. William Phipps, who was alſo ſlain by the Indians, of which I doubt not but you have ſeen an account in Mr. Doolittle's hiſtory. It was from the mouth of this woman that I lately received the foregoing account. She alſo gave me, I doubt not, a true, though, to be ſure, a very brief and imperfect hiſtory of her captivity, which I here inſert for your peruſal.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Indians (ſhe ſays) having plundered and put fire to the fort, we marched, as near as I could judge, a mile and a half into the woods, where we encamped that night.</p>
            <p n="10">10. When the morning came, and we had advanced as much farther, ſix Indians were ſent back to the place of our late abode, who collected a little more plunder, and deſtroyed ſome other effects that had been left behind; but they did not return until the day was ſo far ſpent, that it was judged beſt to continue where we were through the night.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Early the next morning we ſet off for Canada, and continued our march eight days ſucceſſively, until we had reached the place where the Indians had left their canoes, about fifteen miles from Crown Point. This was a long and tedious march; but the captives, by divine aſſiſtance, were enabled to endure it with leſs trouble and difficulty than they had reaſon to expect.</p>
            <p n="12">12. From ſuch ſavage maſters, in ſuch indigent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, we could not rationally hope for kinder treatment than we received. Some of us, it is true, had a harder lot than others; and, among the children, I thought my ſon Squire had the hardeſt of any.</p>
            <p n="13">13. He was then only four years old, and when we ſtopped to reſt our weary limbs, and he ſat down on his
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:026674_0178_0FD156A25A42AFD0"/>
maſter's pack, the ſavage monſter would often knock him off; and ſometimes too with the handle of his hatchet. Several ugly marks, indented in his head by the cruel In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, at that tender age, are ſtill plainly to be ſeen.</p>
            <p n="14">14. At length we arrived at Crown Point, and took up our quarters there, for the ſpace of near a week. In the mean time, ſome of the Indians went to Montreal, and took ſeveral of the weary captives along with them, with a view of ſelling them to the French. They did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, however, in finding a market for any of them.</p>
            <p n="15">15. They gave my youngeſt daughter to the governor, de Vaudreuil, had a drunken frolic, and returned again to Crown Point, with the reſt of their priſoners. From hence we ſet off for St. John's, in four or five canoes, juſt as night was coming on, and were ſoon ſurrounded with darkneſs.</p>
            <p n="16">16. A heavy ſtorm hung over us. The ſound of the rolling thunder was very terrible upon the waters, which at every flaſh of expanſive lightning ſeemed to be all in a blaze. Yet to this we were indebted for all the light we enjoyed. No object could we diſcern any longer than the flaſhes laſted.</p>
            <p n="17">17. In this poſture we ſailed in our open tottering ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes, almoſt the whole of that dreary night. The morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed had not yet begun to dawn, when we all went aſhore; and having collected a heap of ſand and gravel for a pi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>low. I laid myſelf down, with my tender infant by my ſide, not knowing where any of my other children were, or what a miſerable condition they might be in.</p>
            <p n="18">18. The next day, however, under the wing of that ever-preſent and all-powerful Providence, which had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved us through the darkneſs and imminent dangers of the preceding night, we all arrived in ſafety at St. John's.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Our next movement was to St. Francois, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis, if I may ſo call it, to which the Indians, who led us captive, belonged. Soon after our arrival at that wretched capital, a council, conſiſting of the chief Sachem, and ſome principal warriors of the St. Francois tribe, was convened; and after the ceremonies uſual on ſuch occaſions were over, I was conducted and delivered to an old ſquaw, whom the Indians told me I muſt call my mother.</p>
            <p n="20">
               <pb n="179" facs="unknown:026674_0179_0FD156A65B950518"/>20. My infant ſtill continued to be the property of its original Indian owners. I was nevertheleſs permitted to keep it with me a while longer, for the ſake of ſaving them the trouble of looking after it. When the weather began to grow cold, ſhuddering at the proſpect of approaching winter, I acquainted my new mother, that I did not think it would be poſſible for me to endure it, if I muſt ſpend it with her, and fare as the Indians did.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Liſtening to my repeated and earneſt ſolicitations, that I might be diſpoſed of among ſome of the French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Canada, ſhe, at length, ſet off with me and my infant, attended by ſome male Indians, upon a journey to Montreal, in hopes of finding a market for me there. But the attempt proved unſucceſsful, and the journey tedious indeed.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Our proviſions were ſo ſcanty as well as inſipid and unſavory; the weather was ſo cold, and the travelling ſo very bad, that it often ſeemed as if I muſt have periſhed on the way.</p>
            <p n="23">23. While we were at Montreal, we went into the houſe of a certain French gentleman, whoſe lady, being ſent for, and coming into the room where I was, to examine me, ſeeing I had an infant, exclaimed with an oath, "I will not buy a woman who has a child to look after."</p>
            <p n="24">24. There was a ſwill-pail ſtanding near me, in which I obſerved ſome cruſts and crumbs of bread ſwimming on the ſurface of the greaſy liquor it contained. Sorely pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th hunger, I ſkimmed them off with my hands, and ate them; and this was all the refreſhment which the houſe afforded me.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Somewhere in the courſe of this viſit to Montreal, my Indian mother was ſo unfortunate as to catch the ſmall-pox, of which diſtemper ſhe died, ſoon after our return, which was by water, to St. Francois. And now came on the ſeaſon when the Indians began to prepare for a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's hunt.</p>
            <p n="26">26. I was ordered to return my poor child to thoſe of them who ſtill claimed it as their property. This was a ſevere trial. The babe clung to my boſom with all its might; but I was obliged to pluck it thence, and deliver it, ſhrieking and ſcreaming, enough to penetrate a heart of
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:026674_0180_0FD156A8634D0490"/>
ſtone, into the hands of thoſe unfeeling wretches, whoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies may be termed cruel.</p>
            <p n="27">27. It was ſoon carried off by a hunting party of thoſe Indians, to a place called Meſſiſkow, at the lower end of Lake Champlain, whither, in about a month after, it was my fortune to follow them. And here I found it, it is true, but in a condition that afforded me no great ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it being greatly emaciated, and almoſt ſtarved.</p>
            <p n="28">28. I took it in my arms, put its face to mine, and it inſtantly bit me with ſuch violence, that it ſeemed as if I muſt have parted with a piece of my cheek. I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to lodge with it that, and the two following nights; but every morning that intervened, the Indians, I ſuppoſe on purpoſe to torment me, ſent me away to another wig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wam, which ſtood at a little diſtance, though not ſo far from the one in which my diſtreſſed infant was confined, but that I could plainly hear its inceſſant cries, and heart-rending lamentations.</p>
            <p n="29">29. In this deplorable condition, I was obliged to take my leave of it, on the morning of the third day after my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at the place. We moved down the Lake ſeveral miles the ſame day; and the night following was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on account of the <hi>great earthquake</hi> which terribly ſhook that howling wilderneſs.</p>
            <p n="30">30. Among the iſlands hereabouts, we ſpent the winter ſeaſon, often ſhifting our quarters, and roving about from one place to another<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> our family conſiſting of three perſons only, beſides myſelf, viz. my late mother's daughter, whom therefore I called my ſiſter, her ſanhop, and a pap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pooſe.</p>
            <p n="31">31. They once left me alone two diſmal nights; and when they returned to me again, perceiving them ſmile at each other, I aſked what is the matter? They replied, that two of my children were no more. One of which, they ſaid, died a natural death, and the other was knocked on the head.</p>
            <p n="32">32. I did not utter many words, but my heart was ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pained within me, and my mind exceedingly troubled with ſtrange and awful ideas. I often imagined, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, that I plainly ſaw the naked carcaſſes of my deceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed children hanging upon the limbs of the trees, as the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:026674_0181_0FD156AA278E86A0"/>
are wont to hang the raw hides of thoſe beaſts which they take in hunting.</p>
            <p n="33">33. It was not long, however, before it was ſo ordered by kind Providence, that I ſhould be relieved in a good meaſure from thoſe horrid imaginations; for as I was walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day upon the ice, obſerving a ſmoak at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance upon the land, it muſt proceed, thought I, from the fire of ſome Indian hut; and who knows but ſome one of my poor children may be there.</p>
            <p n="34">34. My curioſity, thus excited, led me to the place, and there I found my ſon Caleb, a little boy between two and three years old, whom I had lately buried, in ſentiment a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> leaſt; or rather imagined to have been deprived of life, and perhaps alſo denied a decent grave.</p>
            <p n="35">35. I found him likewiſe in tolerable health and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, under the protection of a fond Indian mother; and moreover had the happineſs of lodging with him in my arms one joyful night. Again we ſhifted our quarters, and when we had travelled eight or ten miles upon the ſnow and ice, came to a place where the Indians manufactured ſugar which they extracted from the maple trees.</p>
            <p n="36">36. Here an Indian came to viſit us, whom I knew, and who could ſpeak Engliſh. He aſked me why I did not go to ſee my ſon Squire. I replied that I had lately been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that he was dead. He aſſured me that he was yet alive, and but two or three miles off, on the oppoſite ſide of the Lake.</p>
            <p n="37">37. At my requeſt, he gave me the beſt directions he could to the place of his abode. I reſolved to embrace the firſt opportunity that offered of endeavoring to ſearch it out. While I was buſy in contemplating this affair, the Indians obtained a little bread, of which they gave me a ſmall ſhare.</p>
            <p n="38">38. I did not taſte a morſel of it myſelf, but ſaved it all for my poor child, if I ſhould be ſo lucky as to find him. At length, having obtained of my keepers leave to be abſent for one day, I ſet off early in the morning, and ſteering, as well as I could, according to the directions which the friendly Indian had given me, I quickly found the place, which he had ſo accurately marked out.</p>
            <p n="39">39. I beheld, as I drew nigh, my little ſon without the camp; but he looked, thought I, like a ſtarved and mangy
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:026674_0182_0FD156AB5A8137A0"/>
puppy, that had been wallowing in the aſhes. I took him in my arms, and he ſpoke to me theſe words, in the Indian tongue; "Mother, are you come?"</p>
            <p n="40">40. I took him into the wigwam with me, and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a number of Indian children in it, I diſtributed all the bread which I had reſerved for my own child, among them all; otherwiſe I ſhould have given great offence.</p>
            <p n="41">41. My little boy appeared to be very fond of his new mother, kept as near me as poſſible while I ſtayed; and when I told him I muſt go, he fell as though he had been knocked down with a club.</p>
            <p n="42">42. But having recommended him to the care of Him who made him, when the day was far ſpent, and the time would permit me to ſtay no longer, I departed, you may well ſuppoſe, with a heavy load at my heart. The tidings I had received of the death of my youngeſt child had, a little before, been confirmed to me beyond a doubt; but I could not mourn ſo heartily for the deceaſed, as for the living child.</p>
            <p n="43">43. When the winter broke up, we removed to St. John's; and through the enſuing ſummer, our principal reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was at no great diſtance from the fort at that place. In the mean time, however, my ſiſter's huſband having been out with a ſcouting party to ſome of the Engliſh ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, had a drunken frolic at the fort, when he returned.</p>
            <p n="44">44. His wife, who never got drunk, but had often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the ill effects of her huſband's intemperance, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what the conſequence might prove, if he ſhould come home in a moroſe and turbulent humor, to avoid his inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, propoſed that we ſhould both retire, and keep out of the reach of it, until the ſtorm abated.</p>
            <p n="45">45. We abſconded accordingly; but ſo it happened, that I returned, and ventured into his preſence, before his wiſe had preſumed to come nigh him. I found him in his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ig <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>am, and in a ſurly mood; and not being able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge upon his wife, becauſe ſhe was not at home, he laid hold of me, and hurried me to the for<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; and, for a trifling conſideration, ſold me to a French gentleman, whoſe name was S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>cca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ee.</p>
            <p n="46">46. It is an ill wind certainly that blows nobody any good. I had been with the Indians a year lacking fourteen
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:026674_0183_0FD156AFEE1AB430"/>
days; and, if not for my ſiſter, yet for me, it was a lucky circumſtance indeed, which thus at laſt in an unexpected moment, ſnatched me out of their cruel hands, and placed me beyond the reach of their inſolent power.</p>
            <p n="47">47. After my Indian maſter had diſpoſed of me in the manner related above, and the moment of ſober reflection had arrived, perceiving that the man who bought me had taken the advantage of him in an unguarded hour, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment began to kindle, and his indignation roſe ſo high, that he threatened to kill me if he ſhould meet me alone; or if he could not revenge himſelf thus, that he would ſet fire to the fort.</p>
            <p n="48">48. I was therefore ſecreted in an upper chamber, and the fort carefully guarded, until his wrath had time to cool. My ſervice in the family to which I was advanced, was perfect freedom, in compariſon with what it had been among the barbarous Indians.</p>
            <p n="49">49. My new maſter and miſtreſs were both as kind and generous towards me as I could reaſonably expect. I ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom aſked a favor of either of them, but it was readily granted. In conſequence of which I had it in my power, in many inſtances, to adminiſter aid and refreſhment to the poor priſoners of my own nation, who were brought into St. John's during my abode in the family of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned benevolent and hoſpitable Saccapee.</p>
            <p n="50">50. Yet even in this family, ſuch trials awaited me as I had little reaſon to expect; but ſtood in need of a large ſtock of prudence, to enable me to encounter them. In this I was greatly aſſiſted by the governor, and Col. Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, who was then a priſoner.</p>
            <p n="51">51. I was moreover under unſpeakable obligations to the governor on another account. I had received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from my daughter Mary, the purport of which was, that there was a proſpect of her being ſhortly married to a young Indian of the tribe of St. Francois, with which tribe ſhe had continued from the beginning of her captivity. Theſe were heavy tidings, and added greatly to the poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of my other afflictions.</p>
            <p n="52">52. However, not long after I had heard this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly news, an opportunity preſented of acquainting that humane and generous gentleman, the commander in chief,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:026674_0184_0FD156B1FB5291B8"/>
and my illuſtrious benefactor, with this affair alſo, who in compaſſion for my ſufferings, and to mitigate my ſorrows, iſſued his orders in good time, and had my daughter taken away from the Indians, and conveyed to the ſame nunnery where her ſiſter was then lodged, with his expreſs injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that they ſhould both of them together be well looked after, and carefully educated, as his adopted children.</p>
            <p n="53">53. In this ſchool of ſuperſtition and bigotry, they continued while the war in thoſe days between France and Great-Britain laſted. At the concluſion of which war, the governor went home to France, took my oldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter along with him, and married her there to a French gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, whoſe name is Cron Lewis.</p>
            <p n="54">54. He was at Boſton with the fleet under Count de Eſtaing, (1778) and one of his clerks. My other daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſtill continuing in the nunnery, a conſiderable time had elapſed after my return from captivity, when I made a jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Canada, reſolving to uſe my beſt endeavors not to return without her.</p>
            <p n="55">55. I arrived juſt in time to prevent her being ſent to France. She was to have gone in the next veſſel that ſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for that place. And I found it extremely difficult to prevail with her to quit the nunnery and go home with me.</p>
            <p n="56">56. Yea, ſhe abſolutely refuſed; and all the perſuaſions and arguments I could uſe with her, w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re to no effect, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til after I had been to the governor, and obtained a letter from him to the ſuperintendent of the nuns, in which he threatened, if my daughter ſhould not be delivered imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately into my hands, or could not be prevailed with to ſubmit to my parental authority, that he would ſend a band of ſoldiers to aſſiſt me in bringing her away.</p>
            <p n="57">57. But ſo extremely bigotted was ſhe to the cuſtoms and religion of the place, that after all, ſhe left it with the greateſt reluctance, and the moſt bitter lamentations, which ſhe continued as we paſſed the ſtreets, and wholly refuſed to be comforted. My good friend, Major Small, whom we met with on the way, tried all he could to conſole her; and was ſo very kind and obliging as to bear us company, and carry my daughter behind him on horſeback.</p>
            <p n="58">58. But I have run on a little before my ſtory; for I have not yet informed you of the means and manner of my
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:026674_0185_0FD156B412BF06C8"/>
own redemption, to the accompliſhing of which, the recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of my daughter juſt mentioned, and the ranſoming of ſome of my other children, ſeveral gentlemen of note con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed not a little; to whoſe goodneſs, therefore, I am greatly indebted, and ſincerely hope I ſhall never be ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful as to forget it.</p>
            <p n="59">59. Col. Schuyler, in particular, was ſo very kind and generous as to advance 2700 livres to procure a ranſom for myſelf and three of my children. He accompanied and conducted us from Montreal to Albany, and entertained us in the moſt friendly and hoſpitable manner a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time, at his own houſe, and I believe entirely at his own expenſe.</p>

            <head>EXTRACT FROM THE SPEECH OF MR. PITT IN THE BRITISH PARLIAMENT,
<date>JAN. 20, 1775.</date>

               <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>

            <p>I RISE with aſtoniſhment to ſee theſe papers brought to your table at ſo late a period of this buſineſs; papers, to tell us what? Why, what all the world knew before; that the Americans, irritated by repeated injuries, and ſtripped of their inborn rights and deareſt privileges, have reſiſted, and entered into aſſociations for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their common liberties.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Had the early ſituation of the people of Boſton been attended to, things would not have come to this. But the infant complaints of Boſton were <hi>literally</hi> treated like the capricious <hi>ſqualls of a child,</hi> who, it was ſaid, did not know whether it was aggrieved or not.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But full well I knew, at that time, that this <hi>child,</hi> if not redreſſed, would ſoon aſſume the courage and voice of a <hi>man.</hi> Full well I knew, that the ſons of anceſtors, born under the ſame free conſtitution, and once breathing the ſame liberal air as Engliſhmen, would reſiſt upon the ſame principles, and on the ſame occaſions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. What has government done? They have ſent an armed force, conſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſting of ſeventeen thouſand men, to dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goon
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:026674_0186_0FD156B53047B5F0"/>
the Boſtonians into what is called their duty; and, ſo far from once turning their eyes to the policy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive conſequence of this ſcheme, are conſtantly ſending out more troops. And we are told, in the language of menace, that, if ſeventeen thouſand men won't do, fifty thouſand ſhall.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is true, my lords, with this force they may ravage the country; waſte and deſtroy as they march; but, in the progreſs of fifteen hundred miles, can they occupy the places they have paſſed? Will not a country, which can produce three millions of people, wronged and inſulted as they are, ſtart up like hydras in every corner, and gather freſh ſtrength from freſh oppoſition?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Nay, what dependence can you have upon the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, the unhappy engines of your wrath? They are En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen, who muſt feel for the privileges of Engliſhmen. Do you think that theſe men can turn their arms againſt their brethren? Surely no. A victory muſt be to them a defeat; and carnage, a ſacrifice.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But it is not merely three millions of people, the produce of America, we have to contend with in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſtruggle; many more are on their ſide, diſperſed over the face of this wide empire. Every whig in this country and in Ireland is with them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Who, then, let me demand, has given, and continues to give, this ſtrange and unconſtitutional advice? I do not mean to level at one man, or any particular ſet of men; but thus much I will venture to declare, that, if his Majeſty continues to hear ſuch counſellors, he will not only be bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſed, but <hi>undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. He may continue indeed to wear his crown; but it will not be worth his wearing. Robbed of ſo principal a jewel as America, it will loſe its luſtre, and no longer beam that effulgence which ſhould irradiate the brow of majeſty.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In this alarming criſis, I come with this paper in my hand to offer you the beſt of my experience and advice, which is, that a humble petition be preſented to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, beſeeching him, that, in order to open the way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a happy ſettlement of the dangerous troubles in America, it may graciouſly pleaſe him, that immediate or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:026674_0187_0FD156B6BACC9108"/>
be given to general Gage for removing his Majeſty's forces from the town of Boſton.</p>
            <p n="11">11. And this, my lords, upon the moſt mature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate grounds, is the beſt advice I can give you, at this juncture. Such conduct will convince America that you mean to try her cauſe in the ſpirit of <hi>freedom</hi> and <hi>inquiry,</hi> and not in <hi>letters of blood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="12">12. There is no time to be loſt. Every hour is big with danger. Perhaps, while I am now ſpeaking, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive blow is ſtruck, which may involve millions in the conſequence. And, believe me, the very firſt drop of blood which is ſhed, will cauſe a wound which may never be healed.</p>

            <head>THE LION.</head>
            <p>THIS animal is produced in Africa, and the hotteſt parts of Aſia. It is found in the greateſt numbers in the ſcorched and deſolate regions of the torrid zone, and in all the interior parts of the vaſt continent of Africa.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In theſe deſert regions, from whence mankind are driven by the rigorous heat of the climate, this animal reigns ſole maſter. Its diſpoſition ſeems to partake of the ardor of its native ſoil. Enflamed by the influence of a burning ſun, its rage is moſt tremendous, and its courage undaunted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Happily, indeed, the ſpecies is not numerous, and is ſaid to be greatly diminiſhed; for, if we may credit the teſtimony of thoſe who have traverſed thoſe vaſt deſerts, the number of lions is not nearly ſo great as formerly.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From numberleſs accounts, we are aſſured that, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and terrible as this animal is, its anger is noble, its courage magnanimous, and its temper ſuſceptible of grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful impreſſions. It has often been ſeen to deſpiſe weak and contemptible enemies, and even to pardon their inſults when it was in its power to puniſh them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It has been known to ſpare the life of an animal that was thrown to be devoured by it; to live in habits of perfect cordiality with it; to ſhare its ſubſiſtence, and even to give it a preference where its portion of food was ſcanty.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="188" facs="unknown:026674_0188_0FD156BB1A60EA18"/>6. The form of the lion is ſtrikingly bold and majeſtic. His large and ſhaggy mane, which he can erect at pleaſure, ſurrounding his awful front; his huge eye-brows; his round and fiery eye-balls, which upon the leaſt irritation ſeem to glow with peculiar luſtre; together with the formidable appearance of his teeth, exhibit a picture of terrific gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur which no words can deſcribe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. The length of the largeſt lion is between eight and nine feet; the tail about four; and its height about four feet and a half. The female is about one fourth part leſs, and without a mane.</p>
            <p n="8">8. As the lion advances in years its mane grows long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and thicker. The hair on the reſt of the body is ſhort and ſmooth, of a tawny color, but whitiſh on the belly. Its roaring is loud and dreadful. When heard in the night, it reſembles diſtant thunder. Its cry of anger is much louder and ſhorter.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The lion ſeldom attacks any animal openly, except when impelled by extreme hunger; in that caſe no danger deters him. But, as moſt animals endeavor to avoid him, he is obliged to have recourſe to artifice, and take his prey by ſurpriſe.</p>
            <p n="10">10. For this purpoſe, he crouches on his belly in ſome thicket, where he waits till his prey approaches; and then, with one prodigious ſpring, he leaps upon it at the diſtance of fifteen or twenty feet, and generally ſeizes it at the firſt bound.</p>
            <p n="11">11. If he miſs his object, he gives up the purſuit; and turning back towards the place of his ambuſh, he meaſures the ground ſtep by ſtep, and again lies in wait for another opportunity. The lurking places are generally choſen by him near a ſpring, or by the ſide or a river, where he has frequently an opportunity of catching ſuch animals as come to quench their thirſt.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The lion is a long-lived animal, although natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts differ greatly as to the preciſe period of its exiſtence. Of ſome that have been trained in the tower of London, one lived to the age of ſixty three years, and another ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſeventy.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The aſpect of the lion correſponds with the noble and generous qualities of his mind; his figure is reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble;
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:026674_0189_0FD156BC0DF63BE8"/>
his looks are determined; his gait is ſtately, and his voice tremendous. In a word, the body of the lion ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the beſt model of ſtrength joined to agility.</p>
            <p n="14">14. As a proof that he is capable of exerciſing a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous and friendly diſpoſition towards mankind, we have the following anecdote of one which was kept in the tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of London.</p>
            <p n="15">15. When this lion was confined in the den alone, an accident happened to the lower part of it, which ſo impair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the wood-work, that he could not be kept with ſafety; the carpenter was therefore called to repair it, who wiſely ſtood at a diſtance, and would not approach the den for fear of the lion.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Upon this, one of the keepers ſtepped into the den, and engaged to keep the lion at the upper part of his houſe, while the carpenter was at work beneath. It happened, however, that the keeper, after playing ſome time with the lion, fell faſt aſleep.</p>
            <p n="17">17. The carpenter continued his work, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger to which he was expoſed; and when he had finiſhed his work, called to the keeper to come down and faſten the door; but received no anſwer.</p>
            <p n="18">18. He then ran out of the den, and was greatly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to ſee, through the grate, both the keeper and the lion ſtretched upon the floor, and ſleeping together. He called to him again, but the keeper was too ſound aſleep to return any anſwer.</p>
            <p n="19">19. The lion however reared up his frightful head, and after looking ſome time at the carpenter, threw his huge paw over the keeper's breaſt, and laying his noſe upon his head, again compoſed himſelf to reſt.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The carpenter already terrified with his own ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was ſtill more alarmed when he ſaw the keeper thus encircled with the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of the lion, and ran into the houſe for aid.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Some of the people came out, and having bolted the den door, which the carpenter had neglected in his precipitate retreat, they rouſed the keeper from his ſleep, who, ſhaking the lion by the paw, took his leave; but the lion was too well-bred to ſuffer his friend to go without ſome little ceremony or marks of eſteem.</p>
            <p n="22">
               <pb n="190" facs="unknown:026674_0190_0FD156BE3AC6A950"/>22. He firſt rubbed his great noſe againſt the keeper's knees, then held him by the coat, as if he would have ſaid, "Do ſtay a little longer;" and when he found that no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties could prevail, he courteouſly waited on him to the door.</p>

            <head>STORY OF THE GRATEFUL TURK.</head>
            <p>IT is too much to be lamented, that different nations frequently make bloody wars with each other; and when they take any of their enemies priſoners, inſtead of uſing them well, and reſtoring them to liberty, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine them in priſons, or ſell them as ſlaves. The enmity that there has often been between many of the Italian ſtates, particularly the Venetians and the Turks, is ſufficiently known.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It once happened that a Venetian ſhip had taken many of the Turks priſoners, and, according to the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous cuſtom I have mentioned, theſe unhappy men had been ſold to different perſons in the city. By accident one of the ſlaves lived oppoſite to the houſe of a rich Venetian, who had an only ſon, of about the age of twelve years.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It happened that this little boy uſed frequently to ſtop as he paſſed near Hamet, for that was the name of the ſlave, and gaze at him very attentively. Hamet, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked in the face of the child the appearance of good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and compaſſion, uſed always to ſalute him with the greateſt courteſy, and teſtified the greateſt pleaſure in his company.</p>
            <p n="4">4. At length the little boy took ſuch a fancy to the ſlave, that he uſed to viſit him ſeveral times in the day, and brought him ſuch little preſents as he had it in his power to make, and which he thought would be of uſe to his friend.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But though Hamet ſeemed always to take the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt delight in the innocent careſſes of his little friend, yet the child could not help remarking that Hamet was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently extremely ſorrowful; and he often ſurpriſed him on a ſudden, when tears were trickling down his face, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he did his utmoſt to conceal them.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="191" facs="unknown:026674_0191_0FD156BFA15D36C8"/>6. The little boy was at length ſo much affected with the repetition of this ſight, that he ſpoke of it to his father, and begged him, if he had it in his power, to make poor Hamet happy. The father, who was extremely fond of his ſon, and beſides, had obſerved that he ſeldom requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any thing which was not generous and humane, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to ſee the Turk himſelf, and talk to him.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Accordingly he went to him the next day, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving him for ſome time in ſilence, was ſtruck with the extraordinary appearance of mildneſs and honeſty which his countenance diſcovered. At length he ſaid to him, Are you that Hamet of whom my ſon is ſo fond, and of whoſe gentleneſs and courteſy I have ſo often heard him talk?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Yes, ſaid the Turk, I am that unfortunate Hamet, who have now been for three years a captive: during that ſpace of time, your ſon, if you are his father, is the only human being that ſeems to have felt any compaſſion for my ſufferings; therefore, I muſt confeſs, he is the only object to which I am attached in this barbarous country; and night and morning I pray that Power, who is equally the God of Turks and Chriſtians, to grant him every bleſſing he deſerves, and to preſerve him from all the miſeries I ſuffer.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Indeed, Hamet, ſaid the merchant, he is much obliged to you, although from his preſent circumſtances, he does not appear much expoſed to danger. But tell me, for I wiſh to do you good, in what can I aſſiſt you? for my ſon informs me that you are the prey of continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret and ſorrow.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Is it wonderful, anſwered the Turk, with a glow of generous indignation that ſuddenly animated his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, is it wonderful that I ſhould pine in ſilence, and mourn my fate, who am bereft of the firſt and nobleſt preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of nature, my liberty? And yet, anſwered the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, how many thouſands of our nation do you retain in fetters?</p>
            <p n="11">11. I am not anſwerable, ſaid the Turk, for the cruelty of my countrymen, more than you are for the barbarity of yours. But as to myſelf, I have never practiſed the inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man cuſtom of enſlaving my fellow-creatures: I have never
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:026674_0192_0FD156C130A55E80"/>
ſpoiled Venetian merchants of their property to increaſe my riches; I have always reſpected the rights of nature, and therefore it is the more ſevere—</p>
            <p n="12">12. Here a tear ſtarted from his eye, and wetted his manly cheek: inſtantly, however, he recollected himſelf, and folding his arms upon his boſom, and gently bowing his head, he added, God is good, and man muſt ſubmit to his decrees. The Venetian was affected with this appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of manly fortitude, and ſaid, Hamet, I pity your ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and may perhaps be able to relieve them. What would you do to regain your liberty?</p>
            <p n="13">13. What would I do! anſwered Hamet; I would confront every pain and danger that can appal the heart of man. Nay, anſwered the merchant, you will not be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to ſuch a trial. The means of your deliverance are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, provided your courage does not belie your appearance.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Name them! name them! cried the impatient Hamet; place death before me in every horrid ſhape, and if I ſhrink—Patience, anſwered the merchant, we ſhall be obſerved. But hear me attentively. I have in this city an inveterate foe, who has heaped upon me every injury which can moſt bitterly ſting the heart of man.</p>
            <p n="15">15. This man is brave as he is haughty; and I muſt confeſs that the dread of his ſtrength and valor has hitherto deterred me from reſenting his inſults as they deſerve. Now, Hamet, your look, your form, your words, convince me that you are born for manly daring.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Take this dagger; and as ſoon as the ſhades of night involve the city, I will myſelf conduct you to the place, where you may at once revenge your friend, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain your freedom.</p>
            <p n="17">17. At this propoſal, ſcorn and ſhame flaſhed from the kindling eye of Hamet, and paſſion for a conſiderable time deprived him of the power of utterance; at length he lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his arms as high as his chains would permit, and cried with an indignant tone, Mighty Prophet! and are theſe the wretches to which you permit your faithful votaries to be enſlaved?</p>
            <p n="18">18. Go, baſe Chriſtian, and know that Hamet would not ſtoop to the vile trade of an aſſaſſin, for all the wealth of Venice! no, not to purchaſe the freedom of all his race!
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:026674_0193_0FD156C29D687140"/>
At theſe words, the merchan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, without ſeeming much abaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, told him he was ſorry he had offended him; but that he thought freedom had been dearer to him than he found it was.</p>
            <p n="19">19. However, added he, as he turned his back, you will reflect upon my propoſal, and perhaps by to-morrow you may change your mind. Hamet diſdained to anſwer, and the merchant went his way.</p>
            <p n="20">20. The next day, however, he returned in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with his ſon, and mildly accoſted Hamet thus; The abruptneſs of the propoſal I yeſterday made you might perhaps aſtoniſh you; but I am now come to diſcourſe the matter more calmly with you, and I doubt not, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>en you have heard my reaſons—</p>
            <p n="21">21. Chriſtian, interrupted Hamet, with a ſevere, but compoſed countenance, ceaſe at length to inſult the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable with propoſals more ſhocking than even theſe chains. If thy religion permit ſuch acts as thoſe, know that they are execrable and abominable to the ſoul of every Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etan: therefore, from this moment let us break off all far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther intercourſe, and be ſtrangers to each other.</p>
            <p n="22">22. No, anſwered the merchant, flinging himſelf into the arms of Hamet, let us from this moment be more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly linked than ever! Generous man, whoſe virtues may at once diſarm and enlighten thy enemies! fondneſs for my ſon firſt made me intereſted in thy fate; but from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that I ſaw thee yeſterday, I determined to ſet thee free. Therefore, pardon me this unneceſſary trial of thy virtue, which has only raiſed thee higher in my eſteem.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Franciſco has a ſoul which is as averſe to deeds of treachery and blood, as even Hamet himſelf. From this moment, generous man, thou art free; thy ranſom is already paid, with no other obligation than that of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering the affection of this thy young and faithful friend; and perhaps, hereafter, when thou ſeeſt an unhappy Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian groaning in Turkiſh fetters, thy generoſity may make thee think of Venice.</p>
            <p n="24">24. The feelings of Hamet at this unexpected deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance are not to be deſcribed. Franciſco put him on board a ſhip, which was bound to one of the Grecian iſlands, and, after taking leave of him in the tendereſt manner, forced him to accept of a purſe of gold to pay his expenſes.</p>
            <p n="25">
               <pb n="194" facs="unknown:026674_0194_0FD156C4E7F3F378"/>25. Affectionate was the parting of Hamet with his little friend, whom he embraced in an agony of tenderneſs, wept over him, and implored Heaven to grant him all the bleſſings of this life.</p>
            <p n="26">26. About ſix months afterwards, one morning, while the family were all in bed, Franciſco's houſe was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be on fire, and great part of the houſe was in flames before the family was alarmed. The terrified ſervants had but juſt time to awaken Franciſco, who was no ſooner got into the ſtreet, than the whole ſtaircaſe gave way, and fell into the flames.</p>

               </gap>f the merchant thought himſelf happy on having ſaved himſelf, it was only for a moment, as he ſoon recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that his beloved ſon was left behind to the mercy of the flames. He ſunk into the deepeſt deſpair, when up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on inquiry he found, that his ſon, who ſlept in an upper apartment, had been forgotten in the general confuſion.</p>
            <p n="28">28. He raved in agonies of grief, and offered half his fortune to any one, who would riſk his life to ſave his child. As he was known to be very rich, ſeveral ladders were inſtantly raiſed by thoſe who wiſhed to obtain the reward; but the violence of the flames drove every one down who attempted it.</p>
            <p n="29">29. The unfortunate youth then appeared on the top of the houſe, extending his arms, and calling out for aid. The unhappy father became motionleſs, and remained in a ſtate of inſenſibility. At this critical moment, a man ruſhed through the crowd, and aſcended the talleſt ladder, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly determined to reſcue the youth, or periſh in the attempt.</p>
            <p n="30">30. A ſudden guſt of flame burſting forth, led the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to ſuppoſe he was loſt; but he preſently appeared de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending the ladder with the child in his arms, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any material injury. A univerſal ſhout attended this noble action, and the father, to his inexpreſſible ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, on recovering from his ſwoon, found his child in his arms.</p>
            <p n="31">31. After giving vent to the firſt emotions of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he inquired after his generous deliverer, whoſe fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were ſo changed by the ſmoak, that they could not be diſtinguiſhed. Franciſco immediately preſented him

with a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ſe of gold, promiſing the next day to give him the re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rd he had offered.</p>
            <p n="32">32. The ſtranger replied, that he ſhould accept of no reward. Franciſco ſtarted, and thought he knew the voice; when his ſon flew to the arms of his deliverer, and cried out, "It is my dear Hamet! it is my dear Hamet!"</p>
            <p n="33">33. The aſtoniſhment and gratitude of the merchant were equally excited; and retiring from the crowd, he took Hamet with him to a friend's houſe. As ſoon as they were alone, Franciſco inquired by what means he had been a ſecond time enſlaved.</p>
            <p n="34">34. I will tell you in a few words, ſaid the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Turk. When I was taken by the Venetian gallies, my father ſhared in my captivity. It was his fate, and not my own, which ſo often made me ſhed thoſe tears, which firſt attracted the notice of your amiable ſon.</p>
            <p n="35">35. As ſoon as your bounty had ſet me free, I flew to the Chriſtian who had purchaſed my father. I told him, that as I was young and vigorous, and he aged and infirm, I would be his ſlave inſtead of my father.</p>
            <p n="36">36. I added too the gold which your bounty had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on me, and by theſe means I prevailed on the Chriſtian to ſend back my father in that ſhip you had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for me, without his knowing the cauſe of his freedom. Since that time I have ſtayed here a willing ſlave, and Heaven has been ſo gracious as to put it into my power to ſave the life of that youth, which I value a thouſand times more than my own.</p>
            <p n="37">37. The merchant was aſtoniſhed at ſuch an inſtance of gratitude and affection, and preſſed Hamet to accept of the half of his fortune, and to ſettle in Venice for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his days. Hamet, however, with a noble mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, refuſed the offer, ſaying, he had done no more than what every one ought to do in a ſimilar ſituation.</p>
            <p n="38">38. Though Hamet ſeemed to under-rate his paſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to the merchant, yet the latter could not ſuffer things to paſs in this manner. He again purchaſed his freedom, and fitted a ſhip out on purpoſe to take him back to his own country. At parting, they mutually embraced each other, and, as they thought, took an eternal farewell.</p>
            <p n="39">
               <pb n="196" facs="unknown:026674_0196_0FD156C855232DB8"/>39. After many years had elapſed, and young Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co was grown up to manhood, beloved and reſpected by every one, it ſo happened that ſome buſineſs made it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for him and his father to viſit a neighboring city on the coaſt; and as they ſuppoſed a paſſage by ſea would be more expeditious than by land, they embarked in a Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian veſſel, which was bound to that port, and ready to ſail.</p>
            <p n="40">40. A favorable gale ſoon wafted them out of ſight, and promiſed them a ſpeedy paſſage; but, unfortunately for them, before they had proceeded half their voyage, they were met by ſome Turkiſh veſſels, who, after an obſtinate reſiſtance from the Venetians, boarded them, loaded them with irons, and carried them priſoners to Tunis. There they were expoſed in the market-place in their chains, in order to be ſold as ſlaves.</p>
            <p n="41">41. At laſt, a Turk came to the market, who ſeemed to be a man of ſuperior rank, and after looking over the priſoners, with an expreſſion of compaſſion, he fixed his eyes upon young Franciſco, and aſked the captain what was the price of that young captive.</p>
            <p n="42">42. The captain replied, that he would not part with him for leſs than five hundred pieces of gold. The Turk conſidered that as a very extraordinary price, ſince he had ſeen him ſell others, that exceeded him in ſtrength and vigor, for leſs than a fifth part of that money.</p>
            <p n="43">43. That is true, (replied the captain) but he ſhall either fetch me a price that will repay me the damage he has occaſioned me, or he ſhall labor all the reſt of his life at the oar. The Turk aſked him, what damage he could have done him more than the reſt of the crew.</p>
            <p n="44">44. It was he (replied the captain) who animated the Chriſtians to make a deſperate reſiſtance, and thereby proved the deſtruction of many of my braveſt ſeamen: We three times boarded them with a fury that ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible, and each time did that youth attack us with a cool and determined oppoſition; ſo that we were obliged to give up the conteſt, till other ſhips came to our aſſiſtance. <hi>I</hi> will therefore have that price for him, or I will puniſh him for life.</p>
            <p n="45">
               <pb n="197" facs="unknown:026674_0197_0FD156C957C213B8"/>45. The Turk now ſurveyed young Franciſco more attentively than before; and the young man, who had hitherto fixed his eyes in ſullen ſilence on the ground, at length raiſed them up; but he had no ſooner beheld the perſon who was talking to the captain, than, in a loud voice, he uttered the name of Hamet. The Turk, ſtruck with aſtoniſhment, ſurveyed him for a moment, and then caught him in his arms.</p>
            <p n="46">46. After a moment's pauſe, the generous Hamet lifted up his hands to heaven, and thanked his God, who had put in his power to ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w his gratitude; but words cannot expreſs his feelings, when he found that both father and ſon were ſlaves. Suffice it to ſay, that he inſtantly bought their freedom, and conducted them to his magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent houſe in the city.</p>
            <p n="47">47. They had here full leiſure to diſcourſe on the ſtrange viciſſitudes of fortune, when Hamet told his Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian friends, that after their generoſity had procured him liberty, he became an officer in the Turkiſh army, and happening to be fortunate in all his enterpriſes, he had been gradually promoted, till he arrived at the dignity of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw of Tunis.</p>
            <p n="48">48. That in this ſituation, he found the greateſt conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in alleviating the misfortunes of the Chriſtian priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and always attended the ſales of thoſe unhappy ſlaves, to procure liberty to a certain number of them. And gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Allah (added he) has this day put it in my power in ſome meaſure to return the duties of gratitude.</p>
            <p n="49">49. They continued ſome days with Hamet, who did every thing in his power to amuſe and divert them; but as he found their deſire was to return to their own country, he told them that he would not detain them againſt their wiſhes; and that they ſhould embark the next day in a ſhip bound for Venice, which would be furniſhed with a paſſport to carry them ſafe there.</p>
            <p n="50">50. The next day, he diſmiſſed them with every mark of tenderneſs and affection, and ordered a party of his own guards to attend them to the veſſel. They had no ſooner got on board, than they found, to their inexpreſſible ſurpriſe and joy, that they were in the very ſhip in which they had been taken, and that, by the generoſity of Hamet,
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:026674_0198_0FD156CAD9576570"/>
not only the ſhip, but even the whole crew, were redeemed and reſtored to freedom.</p>
            <p n="51">51. Franciſco and his ſon, after a quick paſſage, arrived in their own country, where they lived beloved and reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and endeavored to convince every one they knew, how great were the viciſſitudes of fortune, and that God never ſuffers humanity and generoſity to go unrewarded, here or hereafter.</p>

            <head>SPEECH OF DEMOSTHENES TO THE ATHE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NIANS, CONCERNING THE REGULATION OF THE STATE.</head>
            <p>YOU aſk, Athenians, "What real advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage have we derived from the ſpeeches of Demoſthenes? He riſes when he thinks proper; he deafens us with his harangues; he declaims againſt the degeneracy of preſent
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:026674_0202_0FD12B175F6CB550"/>
times; he tells us of the virtues of our anceſtors; he tranſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ports us by his airy extravagance; he puffs up our vanity; and then ſits down."</p>
            <p n="2">2. But, could theſe my ſpeeches once gain an effectual influence upon your minds, ſo great would be the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages conferred upon my country, that, were I to attempt to ſpeak them, they would appear to many as viſionary. Yet ſtill I muſt aſſume the merit of doing ſome ſervice, by ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtoming you to hear ſalutary truths.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And if your counſellors be ſolicitous for any point of moment to their country, let them firſt cure your ears; for they are diſtempered; and this, from the inveterate habit of liſtening to falſehoods, to every thing, rather than your real intereſts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. There is no man who dares openly and boldly to declare, in what caſe our conſtitution is ſubverted. But I ſhall declare it. When you, Athenians, become a helpleſs rabble, without conduct, without property, without arms, without order, without unanimity; when neither your general, nor any other perſon, hath the leaſt reſpect for your decrees; when no man dares to inform you of this your condition, to urge the neceſſary reformation, much leſs to exert his effort to effect it; then is your conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſubverted. And this is now the caſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. But, O my fellow-citizens! a language of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nature hath poured in upon us; falſe, and highly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the State. Such is that aſſertion, that in your tribunals is your great ſecurity; that your right of ſuffrage is the real bulwark of the conſtitution. That theſe tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals are our common reſource in all private conteſts, I acknowledge.</p>
            <p n="6">6. But, it is by arms we are to ſubdue our enemies; by arms we are to defend our State. It is not by our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees that we can conquer. To thoſe, on the contrary, who ſight our battles with ſucceſs, to theſe we owe the power of decreeing, of tranſacting all our affairs, without control or danger. In arms, then, let us be terrible; in our judicial tranſactions, humane.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If it be obſerved, that theſe ſentiments are more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated than might be expected from my character; the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, I confeſs, is juſt. Whatever is ſaid about a ſtate
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:026674_0203_0FD156D2D00326D0"/>
of ſuch dignity, upon affairs of ſuch importance, ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear more elevated than any character. To your worth ſhould it correſpond, not to that of the ſpeaker.</p>
            <p n="8">8. And now I ſhall inform you why none of thoſe, who ſtand high in your eſteem, ſpeak in the ſame manner. The candidates for office and employment go about ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your voices, the ſlaves of popular favor. To gain the rank of general, is each man's great concern; not to fill this ſtation with true manlike intrepidity.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Courage, if he poſſeſs it, he deems unneceſſary; for, thus he reaſons; he has the honor, the renown of this city to ſupport him; he finds himſelf free from oppreſſion and control; he needs but to amuſe you with fair hopes; and, thus, he ſecures a kind of inheritance in your emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And he reaſons truly.</p>
            <p n="10">10. But, do you yourſelves once aſſume the conduct of your own affairs; and then, as you take an equal ſhare of duty, ſo ſhall you acquire an equal ſhare of glory. Now, your miniſters and public ſpeakers, without one thought of directing you faithfully to your true intereſt, reſign them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves entirely to theſe generals. Formerly you divided into claſſes, in order to raiſe the ſupplies; now the buſineſs of the claſſes is to gain the management of public affairs.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The orator is the leader; the general ſeconds his attempts; the Three Hundred are the aſſiſtants on each ſide; and all others take their parties, and ſerve to fill up the ſeveral factions. And you ſee the conſequences.</p>
            <p n="12">12. This man gains a ſtatue; this amaſſes a fortune; one or two command the State; while you ſit down uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, witneſſes of their ſucceſs; and, for an uninterrupted courſe of eaſe and indolence, give them up thoſe great and glorious advantages, which really belong to you.</p>

            <head>A FATHER'S ADVICE TO HIS CHILDREN.</head>
            <p>OBSERVE and mark as well as you may, what is the temper and diſpoſition of thoſe perſons, whoſe ſpeeches you hear, whether they be grave, ſerious, ſober, wiſe, diſcreet perſons. If they be ſuch, their ſpeeches
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:026674_0204_0FD156D4081D54E0"/>
commonly are like themſelves, and well deſerve your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and obſervation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But, if they be light, impertinent, vain, paſſionate perſons, their ſpeech is for the moſt part accordingly; and the beſt advantage that you will gain by their ſpeech, is but thereby to learn their diſpoſitions; to diſcern their failings, and to make yourſelves the more cautious both in your converſation with them, and in your own ſpeech and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment; for in the unſeemlineſs of their ſpeech you may better diſcern and avoid the like in yourſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If any perſon, that you do not very well know to be a perſon of truth, ſobriety, and weight, relate ſtrange ſtories, be not too ready or eaſy to believe them, nor report them after him. And yet, unleſs he be one of your familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, be not too forward to contradict him; or if the neceſſity of the occaſion require you to declare your opinion of what is ſo reported, let it be modeſtly and gently, not too bluntly or coarſely. By this mean, on the one ſide you will avoid being abuſed by your too much credulity; on the other ſide, you will avoid quarrels and diſtaſte.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If any man ſpeak any thing to the diſadvantage or reproach of one that is abſent, be not too ready to believe it; only obſerve and remember it, for it may be it is not true, or it is not all true, or ſome other circumſtances were min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with it, which might give the buſineſs reported a juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, or at leaſt an allay, an extenuation, or a reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excuſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If any perſon report unto you ſome injury done to you by another, either in words or deeds, do not be over haſty in believing it; nor ſuddenly angry with the perſon ſo accuſed; for it is poſſible it may be falſe or miſtaken; and how unſeemly a thing will it be, when your credulity and paſſion ſhall perchance carry you, upon a ſuppoſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, to do wrong to him that hath done you none.</p>
            <p n="6">6. When a perſon is accuſed or reported to have injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, before you give yourſelf leave to be angry, think with yourſelf, why ſhould I be angry before I am certain it is true; or if it be true, how can I tell how much I ſhould be angry, till I know the whole matter? Though it may be he hath done me wrong, yet poſſibly it is miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, or it was done by miſtake, or it may be he is ſorry for it.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="205" facs="unknown:026674_0205_0FD156D588F6A998"/>7. I will not be angry till I know there be cauſe, and if there be cauſe, yet I will not be angry till I know the whole cauſe; for till then, if I muſt be angry at all, yet I know not how much to be angry; it may be it is not worth my anger, or if it be, it may be it deſerves but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. This will keep your mind and carriage upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions in a due temper and order; and will diſappoint ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious or officious tale-bearers.</p>
            <p n="8">8. If a man, whoſe integrity you do not very well know, make you great and extraordinary profeſſions and promiſes, give him as kind thanks as may be, but give not much cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it to it. Caſt about with yourſelf what may be the reaſon of his wonderful kindneſs; it is twenty to one but you will find ſomething that he aims at, beſide kindneſs to you.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If a man flatter and commend you to your face, or to one that he thinks will tell you of it; it is a thouſand to one, either he hath deceived and abuſed you ſome way, or means to do ſo. Remember the fable of the fox commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſinging of the crow, when ſhe had ſomew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> in her mouth that the fox liked.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If a perſon be choleric, paſſionate, and give you ill language, remember, firſt, rather to pity him than to be moved into anger and paſſion with him; for moſt certainly that man is in a diſtemper, and diſordered. Obſerve him calmly, and you ſhall ſee in him ſo much perturbation and diſturbance, that you will eaſily believe he is not a pattern to be imitated by you, and therefore return not choler for anger; for you do but put yourſelf into a kind of frenzy becauſe you ſee him ſo.</p>
            <p n="11">11. Be ſure you return not railing, reproaching, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viling for reviling; for it doth but kindle more heat, and you will find ſilence, or at leaſt very gentle words, the moſt exquiſite revenge for reproaches that can be; for either it will cure the diſtemper in the other, and make him ſee and be ſorry for his paſſion, or it will torment him with more perturbation and diſturbance.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Some men are excellent in the knowledge of huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry, ſome of planting, ſome of gardening, ſome in the mathematics, ſome in one kind, ſome in another; in all your converſation, learn as near as you can wherein the ſkill and excellence of any perſon lies, and put him upon
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:026674_0206_0FD156D58FFE0268"/>
talk of that ſubject, and obſerve it, and keep it in memory or writing; by this mean you will glean up the worth and excellence of every perſon you meet with, and at an eaſy rate put together that which may be for your uſe upon all occaſions.</p>
            <p n="13">13. Converſe not with a liar or a ſwearer, or a man of obſcene or wanton language; for either he will corrupt you, or at leaſt it will hazard your reputation to be one of the like making. And if it doth neither, yet it will fill your memory with ſuch diſcourſes, that will be troubleſome to you in after-time, and the returns of the remembrance of the paſſages which you long ſince heard of this nature, will haunt you, when your thoughts ſhould be better employed.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Let your ſpeech be true; never ſpeak any thing for a truth which you know or believe to be falſe. It is a great ſin againſt God who gave you a tongue, to ſpeak your offence againſt humanity itſelf; for where there is no truth, there can be no ſafe ſociety between man and man.</p>
            <p n="15">15. As you muſt be careful not to lie, ſo you muſt avoid coming near to it; you muſt not equivocate, you muſt not ſpeak that abſolutely, which you have but by hear ſay or relation; you muſt not ſpeak that as upon knowledge which you have but by conjecture or opinion only.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Let your words be few, eſpecially when your bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or ſtrangers, or men of experience or underſtanding, are preſent; for you do yourſelf at once two great miſchiefs. Firſt, you betray and diſcover your own weakneſs and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Secondly, you rob yourſelf of that opportunity which you might otherwiſe have to gain knowledge, wiſdom, and experience, by hearing thoſe whom you ſilence by your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inent talking.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Be not over earneſt, loud, or violent in talking; for it is unſeen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly; and earneſt and loud talking make you over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoot and loſe your buſineſs. When you ſhould be conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering and pondering your thoughts, and how to expreſs them ſignificantly, and to the purpoſe, you are ſtriving to keep your tongue going, and to ſilence an opponent, not with reaſon but with noiſe.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Be careful not to interrupt another in his talk; hear him out; you will underſtand him the better, and be able to give him the better anſwer. It may be, if you will give
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:026674_0207_0FD156D7873A1CE8"/>
him leave, he will ſay ſomething more than you have yet heard, or well underſtood, or that which you did not expect.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Always before you ſpeak, eſpecially where the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is of moment, conſider beforehand, weigh the ſenſe of your mind, which you intend to utter; think upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions you intend to uſe, that they may be ſignificant, pertinent, and inoffenſive; and whereas it is the ordinary courſe of inconſiderate perſons to ſpeak their words, and then to think, or not to think till they ſpeak; think firſt and ſpeak after; if it be in any matter of moment or ſeriouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="20">20. Be ſure you give not an ill report to any that you are not ſure deſerves it. And in moſt caſes, though a man deſerve ill, yet you ſhould be ſparing to report him ſo. In ſome caſes indeed you are bound, in honeſty and juſtice, to give that account concerning the demerit or default of a perſon that he deſerves.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Avoid ſcoffing, and bitter and biting jeering, and jeſting, eſpecially at the condition, credit, deformity, or natural defects of any perſon; for theſe leave a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and are moſt apparent injuſtice; for, were you ſo uſed, you would take it amiſs; and many times ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury coſts a man dear, when he little thinks of it.</p>
            <p n="22">22. Be very careful that you give no reproachful, bitter, menacing, or ſpiteful words to any perſon, nay not to ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants or other perſons of an inferior condition. There is no perſon ſo mean but that you may ſtand in need of him in one kind, or at ſome time or another. Good words make friends, bad words make enemies; it is the beſt prudence in the world to make as many friends as honeſtly you can.</p>
            <p n="23">23. If there be occaſion for you to ſpeak in any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, always be careful, if you ſpeak at all, to ſpeak lateſt, eſpecially if ſtrangers are in company; for by this mean you will have the advantage of knowing the ſenſe, judgment, temper, and relations of others, which may be a great light and help to you in ordering your ſpeech; and you will bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter know the inclination of the company, and ſpeak with more advantage and acceptation, and with more ſecurity againſt giving offence.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Be careful that you commend not yourſelves; it is the moſt uſeleſs thing that can be. You ſhould avoid flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery from others, but eſpecially decline flattering yourſelves.
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:026674_0208_0FD156D8C717D390"/>
It is a ſign your reputation is ſmall and ſinking, if your own tongues muſt be your flatterers or commenders; and it is a fulſome and unpleaſing thing for others to hear it.</p>
            <p n="25">25. Abhor all foul, unclean and obſcene ſpeeches, it is a ſign that the heart is corrupt; and ſuch kind of ſpeeches will make it worſe; it will taint and corrupt yourſelves and thoſe who hear it, and bring diſreputation to thoſe who uſe it.</p>
            <p n="26">26. Never uſe any profane ſpeeches, nor make jeſts of ſcripture expreſſions. When you uſe the names of God or Chriſt, or any paſſages or words of the holy ſcripture, uſe them with reverence and ſeriouſneſs, and not lightly or ſcurrilouſly, for it is taking the name of God in vain.</p>
            <p n="27">27. If you hear any unſeemly expreſſions uſed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exerciſes, you muſt be careful to forget and not to publiſh them, or if you at all mention them, let it be with pity and ſorrow, not with deriſion or reproach.</p>

The formidable <hi>Heights of Abraham</hi> are now ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted; and the city of Quebec, the object of all our toils, now ſtands in full view before us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A perfidious enemy, who have dared to exaſperate you by their cruelties, but not to oppoſe you on equal ground, are now conſtrained to face you on the open plain, without ramparts or entrenchments to ſhelter them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You know too well the forces which compoſe their army to dread their ſuperior numbers. A few regular troops from Old France, weakened by hunger and ſickneſs, who when freſh were unable to withſtand Britiſh ſoldiers, are their General's chief dependence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Thoſe numerous companies of Canadians, inſolent, mutinous, unſteady and ill diſciplined, have exerciſed his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſkill to keep them together to this time; and as ſoon as their irregular ardor is damped by one firm fire, they will inſtantly turn their backs, and give you no further trouble but in the purſuit.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As for thoſe ſavage tribes of Indians, whoſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid yells in the foreſts have ſtruck many a bold heart with affright, terrible as they are with the tomahawk and ſcalp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-knife to a flying and proſtrate foe, you have experienced how little their ferocity is to be dreaded by reſolute men upon fair and open ground. You can now only conſider them as the juſt objects of a ſevere revenge for the unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fate of many ſlaughtered countrymen.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This day puts it into your power to te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <head>FOSCARI, THE UNFORTUNATE VE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NETIAN.</head>
            <p>THE moſt affecting inſtance of the odious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexibility of Venetian courts, appears in the caſe of Foſcari, ſon to the Doge of that name. This young man had, by ſome imprudences, given offence to the Senate, and was, by their orders, confined at Treviſo, when Almor Donato, one of the Council of Ten, was aſſaſſinated, on the 5th of November, 1450, as he entered his own houſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A reward, in ready money, with pardon for this or any other crime, and a penſion of two hundred ducats, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible to children, was promiſed to any perſon who would diſcover the planner or perpetrator of this crime. No ſuch diſcovery was made.</p>
            <p n="3">3. One of young Foſcari's footmen, named Olivier, had been obſerved loitering near Donato's houſe, on the evening of the murder; he fled from Venice next morning. Theſe, with other circumſtances of leſs importance, created a ſtrong ſuſpicion that Foſcari had engaged this man to commit the murder.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Olivier was taken, brought to Venice, put to the torture, and confeſſed nothing; yet the Council of Ten, being prepoſſeſſed with an opinion of their guilt, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that the maſter would have leſs reſolution, uſed him in the ſame cruel manner. The unhappy young man, in the midſt of his agony, continued to aſſert, that he knew nothing of the aſſaſſination.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This convinced the Court of his firmneſs, but not of his innocence; yet as there was no legal proof of his guilt, they could not ſentence him to death. He was condemned to paſs the reſt of his life in baniſhment, at Canea, in the iſland of Candia.</p>
            <p n="6">6. This unfortunate youth bore his exile with more impatience than he had done the rack; he often wrote to his relations and friends, praying them to intercede in his behalf, that the term of his baniſhment might be abridged, and that he might be permitted to return to his family be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he died. All his applications were fruitleſs; thoſe

to whom he addreſſed himſelf had never interfered in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> favor, for fear of giving offence to the obdurate Council<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or had interfered in vain.</p>
            <p n="7">7. After languiſhing five years in exile, having loſt all hope of return, through the interpoſition of his own family or countrymen, in a fit of deſpair he addreſſed the Duke of Milan, putting him in mind of ſervices which the Dog<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, his father, had rendered him, and begging that he would uſe his powerful influence with the State of Venice, that his ſentence might be recalled.</p>
            <p n="8">8. He entruſted his letter to a merchant, going from Canea to Venice, who promiſed to take the firſt opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſending it from thence to the Duke; inſtead of which, this wretch, as ſoon as he arrived at V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ice, deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered it to the chiefs of the Council of Ten.</p>
            <p n="9">9. This conduct of young Foſcari appeared criminal in the eyes of thoſe Judges; for by the laws of the republic, all its ſubjects are expreſsly forbidden claiming the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of foreign princes, in any thing which relates to the government of Venice.</p>
            <p n="10">10. Foſcari was therefore ordered to be brought from Candia, and ſhut up in the State priſon. There the chiefs of the Council of Ten ordered him once more to be put to the torture, to draw from him the motives which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined him to apply to the Duke of Milan. Such an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion of law is, indeed, the moſt flagrant injuſtice.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The miſerable youth declared to the Council, that he wrote the letter in the full perſuaſion that the merchant, whoſe character he knew, would betray him, and deliver it to them; the conſequence of which, he foreſaw, would be, his being ordered back a priſoner to Venice, the only means he had in his power of ſeeing his parents and friends; a pleaſure for which he had languiſhed, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable deſire, for ſome time, and which he was willing to purchaſe at the expenſe of any danger or pain.</p>
            <p n="12">12. The Judges, little affected with this generous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of filial piety, ordained, that the unhappy young man ſhould be carried back to Candia, and there be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for a year, and remain baniſhed to that iſland fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

applications to foreign powers, his impriſonment ſhould be perpetual. At the ſame time they gave permiſſion, that the Doge and his lady might viſit their unfortunate ſon.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Doge was, at this time, very old; he had been in poſſeſſion of the office above thirty years. Thoſe wretched parents had an interview with their ſon in one of the apartments of the palace; they embraced him with all the tenderneſs which his misfortunes and his filial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection deſerved.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The father exhorted him to bear his hard fate with firmneſs. The ſon proteſted, in the moſt moving terms, that this was not in his power; that however others could ſupport the diſmal lonelineſs of a priſon, he could not; that his heart was formed for friendſhip, and the reciprocal endearments of ſocial life; without which, his ſoul ſunk into dejection worſe than death, from which alone he ſhould look for relief, if he ſhould again be confined to the horrors of a priſon; and, melting into tears, he ſunk at his father's feet, imploring him to take compaſſion on a ſon who had ever loved him with the moſt dutiful affection, and who was perfectly innocent of the crime of which he was accuſed.</p>
            <p n="15">15. He conjured him, by every bond of nature and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, by the bowels of a father, and the mercy of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, to uſe his influence with the Council to mitigate their ſentence, that he might be ſaved from the moſt cruel of all deaths, that of expiring under the ſlow tortures of a broken heart, in a horrible baniſhment from every creature he loved. "My ſon," replied the Doge, "ſubmit to the laws of your country, and do not aſk of me what is not in my power to obtain."</p>
            <p n="16">16. Having made this effort, he retired to another apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and, unable to ſupport any longer the acuteneſs of his feelings, ſunk into a ſtate of inſenſibility, in which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he remained till ſome time after his ſon had failed on his return to Candia.</p>
            <p n="17">17. Nobody has preſumed to deſcribe the anguiſh of the wretched mother. Thoſe who are endowed with the moſt exquiſite ſenſibility, and who have experienced diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes in ſome degree ſimilar, will have the juſteſt idea of what it was.</p>
            <p n="18">
               <pb n="219" facs="unknown:026674_0219_0FD156EFF53AE460"/>18. The accumulated miſery of thoſe unhappy parents touched the hearts of ſome of the moſt powerful Senators, who applied with ſo much energy for a complete pardon for young Foſcari, that they were on the point of obtaining it; when a veſſel arrived from Candia, with tidings, that the miſerable youth had expired in priſon a ſhort time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his return.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Some years after this, Nicholas Erizzo, a noble Venetian, being on his death-bed, confeſſed that, bearing a violent reſentment againſt the Senator Donato, he had committed the aſſaſſination for which the unhappy family of Foſcari had ſuffered ſo much.</p>
            <p n="20">20. At this time the ſorrows of the Doge were at an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd; he had exiſted only a few months after the death of his ſon. His life had been prolonged, till he beheld his ſon perſecuted to death for an infamous crime; but not till he ſhould ſee this foul ſtain waſhed from his family, and the innocence of his beloved ſon made manifeſt to the world.</p>
            <p n="21">21. The ways of Heaven never appeared more dark and intricate, than in the incidents and cataſtrophe of this mournful ſtory. To reconcile the permiſſion of ſuch events to our ideas of infinite power and goodneſs, however diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, is a natural attempt in the human mind, and has exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the ingenuity of philoſophers in all ages, while, in the eye of Chriſtians, thoſe ſeeming perplexities afford an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional proof, that there will be a future ſtate in which the ways of God to man will be fully juſtified.</p>

            <p>I ASK now, Verres, what you have to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance againſt this charge? Will you pretend to deny it? Will you pretend that any thing falſe, that even any thing aggravated is alleged againſt you?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Had any prince, or any ſtate, committed the ſame outrage againſt the privilege of Roman citizens, ſhould we
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:026674_0220_0FD156F1DB47EAD0"/>
not think we had ſufficient reaſon for declaring immediate war againſt them?</p>
            <p n="3">3. What puniſhment, then, ought to be inflicted upon a tyrannical and wicked praetor, who dared, at no greater diſtance than Sicily, within ſight of the Italian coaſt, to put to the infamous death of crucifixion that unfortunate and innocent citizen, Publius Gavius Cofanus, only for his hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſerted his privilege of citizenſhip, and declared his intention of appealing to the juſtice of his country againſt a cruel oppreſſor, who had unjuſtly confined him in priſon at Syracuſe, whence he had juſt made his eſcape?</p>
            <p n="4">4. The unhappy man, arreſted as he was going to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark for his native country, is brought before the wicked praetor. With eyes darting fury, and a countenance diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>orted with cruelty, he orders the helpleſs victim of his rage to be ſtripped, and rods to be brought; accuſing him, but without the leaſt ſhadow of evidence, or even of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion, of having come to Sicily as a ſpy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It was in vain that the unhappy man cried out, "I am a Roman citizen; I have ſerved under Lucius Pretius, who is now at Panormus, and will atteſt my innocence." The blood-thirſty praetor, deaf to all he could urge in his own defence, ordered the infamous puniſhment to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Thus, fathers, was an innocent Roman citizen pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly mangled with ſcourging; whilſt the only words he uttered amidſt his cruel ſufferings were, "I am a Roman citizen!" With theſe he hoped to defend himſelf from vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence and infamy. But of ſo little ſervice was this privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege to him, that while he was aſſerting his citizenſhip, the order was given for his execution; for his execution upon the croſs!</p>
            <p n="7">7. O Liberty! O ſound, once delightful to every Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ear! O ſacred privilege of Roman citizenſhip! once ſacred! now trampled upon! But what then! Is it come to this? Shall an inferior magiſtrate, a governor, who holds his power of the Roman people, in a Roman province, within ſight of Italy, bind, ſcourge, torture with fire and red-hot plates of iron, and at laſt put to the infamous death of the croſs, a Roman citizen?</p>

               <pb n="221" facs="unknown:026674_0221_0FD156F3D59442F0"/>8.

            <p n="9">9. I conclude with expreſſing my hopes, that your wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and juſtice, fathers, will not, by ſuffering the atrocious and unexampled inſolence of Caius Verres to eſcape the due puniſhment, leave room to apprehend the danger of a total ſubverſion of authority, and introduction of general an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archy and confuſion.</p>

               <p>How can we poſſibly appear always happy, when we have ſo few happy days? There is ever ſome thorn an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the ſweeteſt roſe.

remedy for it? May not much be done by prudence and reſolution towards curing it? Ill humor may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to ſloth.

               <p>But we are not maſters of ourſelves; our feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings overpower our reaſon, and even make us neglect our intereſt. You may as well adviſe milk not to turn ſour by being expoſed to the ſun, or the ſenſitive plant not to ſhrink from the touch, as the mind of man to be unruffled by croſs accidents, and his appearance to be calm and cheerful, when he ſuffers inſults, injuries, or pain.</p>

Why not uſe more diligence and care to cure them? What quality is more deſirable than good humor? It adds charms to virtue, and even leſſens the hatefulneſs of vice. It is eſſential to ſocial happineſs; and when we chuſe a companion, whether for an hour or a year, for the journey of a day, or the journey of life, this is a principal requiſite.</p>

               <p>I acknowledge its excellency. It is valuable in brute animals; it pleaſes even in a domeſtic cat or dog; and good temper is one of the beſt qualities in a horſe, which no beauty of ſhape, color or eyes can ſupply. How much more amiable is it in a fellow-being? But what methods can you preſcribe for obtaining and preſerving it? Perhaps I <hi>may</hi> become a proficient, if not an adept in this art.</p>

            <head>A SHORT ADDRESS TO PARENTS.</head>
            <p>TO you, who are parents, nature itſelf hath given a tender concern for your children's welfare, as your own; and reminds you juſtly, that, as you have brought them into the dangers of life, your buſineſs is to provide that they get well through them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Now, the only proviſion commonly attended to, of wealth and honors, can never produce happineſs, unleſs the mind, on which all depends, be taught to enjoy them prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly.
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:026674_0224_0FD156FCD0C1BBE0"/>
Fortune, without this, will but lead them to more abandoned ſallies of extravagance, and expoſe them to more public cenſure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Education then is the great care with which you are entruſted; ſcarce more for their ſakes than your own. You may be negligent of your ſon's inſtruction, but it is on you as well as himſelf, that his ignorance and contemptible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will bring both reproach and inconvenience. You may be regardleſs of his moral<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>; but you may be the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who will at laſt moſt ſeverely feel the want of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You may be indifferent about his religion; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, dutifulneſs to you is one great principle of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and all the reſt promote ſuch habits as you may bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repent (when it is too late) your omiſſion to cultivate in him; and you may live and die miſerable on his account, whom timely care would have made your joy and comfort.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Therefore, in a caſe of ſuch moment, let no falſe ſhame nor favorite paſſion prevail over you, but "Give your hearts early to the Lord who made you." Lay the foundations of your lives here, on the firm ground of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian faith; and build upon it whatever is juſt and good, worthy and noble, till the ſtructure be complete in moral beauty.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The world, into which you are entering, lies in wait with variety of temptations. Unfavorable ſentiments of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion will ſoon be ſuggeſted to you, and all the ſnares of luxury, falſe honor, and intereſt, ſpread in your way, which, with moſt of your rank, are too ſucceſsful, and to many, fatal.</p>

            <p n="8">8. But happieſt of men is he, who, by an even courſe of right conduct, from the firſt, as far as human frailty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, hath at once avoided the miſeries of ſin, the ſorrows of repentance, and the difficulties of virtue; who not only can think of his preſent ſtate with compoſure, but reflect on his paſt behavior with thankful approbation; and look forward with unmixed joy to that important future hour, when he ſhall appear before God, and humbly offer to him a whole life ſpent in his ſervice.</p>

            <head>A SERIOUS ADDRESS FROM A PRECEPTOR TO HIS SCHOLARS.</head>
            <p>I AM truly ſenſible of the important truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in me, and cannot but feel a ſolicitude to diſcharge it with propriety. I will not ſay that the pecuniary emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ariſing from it is by any means indifferent to me. No man would ſacrifice his eaſe, and enter into an anxious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, without a deſire of thoſe rewards which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to induſtry.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And it is equitable that he, who is willing to ſtep forward and render himſelf extenſively uſeful to others, ſhould derive ſuch advantages from his exertions, as may render his old age eaſy and reſpected, or provide for the wants of a riſing family.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But I muſt declare, on the other hand, that the ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction ariſing from a conſciouſneſs of performing the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incumbent on me, and rendering a ſervice equivalent to the recompenſe, ſweetens every labor, and gives additional value to the pecuniary compenſation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You are placed here for two purpoſes; the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the underſtanding, and the formation of virtuous principles for the guidance of your moral conduct. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the underſtanding is apparently the firſt object in your entrance at ſchool; but it cannot be doubted but that improvement of the heart is really eſteemed by thoſe to whom you are moſt dear, at a higher price than the fineſt accompliſhment of the moſt cultivated intellect.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is your buſineſs to unite theſe eſtimable objects, and to ſuffer your hearts and underſtandings to vie with each other in the purſuit of excellence. The principal pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of my frequent addreſſes is to promote the knowledge and the practice of the Chriſtian religion; and in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of this purpoſe, I ſhall of neceſſity be led to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ommend the pureſt ſyſtem of morality. Ethics, improved and exalted by the Chriſtian religion, become the guides to real wiſdom and ſolid happineſs, to which they could nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er attain when taught only in the ſchools of heathen phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="226" facs="unknown:026674_0226_0FD15701A4F764E8"/>6. In the religious part of your education, it is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that you ſhould be engaged in the profound diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theology. The plain doctrines of the religion which you have been taught to profeſs muſt be explained to you; but the principal buſineſs is to open your hearts for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of thoſe ſentiments and precepts, which conduce to the direction of your actions in the employments and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements of your ſubſequent life.</p>
            <p n="7">7. In the firſt place, I muſt then remind you of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of reading the Scriptures; that is, of drinking the ſacred waters at the fountain. But to read the Scriptures to advantage, judgment is neceſſary; and as judgment at your age is not mature, you muſt ſeek and follow the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of your inſtructors.</p>
            <p n="8">8. At your age, the plaineſt and moſt perſpicuous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages will beſt deſerve and reward your attention. The hiſtorical parts of the Old Teſtament will entertain you, if you conſider them only in a claſſical view, as valuable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of ancient hiſtory; but I chiefly refer you to the books which more immediately conduce to moral inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If you read the Old Teſtament with a taſte for its beauties, you will accompliſh two important purpoſes at the ſame time. You will acquire a knowledge of the Holy Bible, which is your duty; and you will improve your taſte and judgment, which is your buſineſs as ſtudents in the courſe of a polite education.</p>
            <p n="10">10. The New Teſtament requires the peculiar attention of every one who profeſſes himſelf a Chriſtian. But here alſo judgment is neceſſary to direct the ſtudent in the mode of his ſtudy. To one who has not the requiſite ſhare of introductory knowledge, the Goſpel will appear to contain many difficulties.</p>
            <p n="11">11. As you cannot yet engage in theological ſtudies, I muſt recommend it to you to take up the Teſtament with that humility which becomes all human creatures, but more particularly perſons ſo young as you are, and ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of all that knowledge which can enable you to form a deciſive opinion in divinity.</p>
            <p n="12">12. You will do right to pay particular attention to the ſermon on the mount, and to that admirable epitome of all
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:026674_0227_0FD1570779771EE0"/>
moral philoſophy, the rule of doing to others as we wiſh them to do to us. If you pay due obedience to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, you will never heſitate in determining what part you ſhall act whenever difficulties occur.</p>
            <p n="13">13. It will however be proper that you ſhould at an early age familiarize to your mind the language of the Scriptures, in all their parts, though you ſhould not be able fully to comprehend them. You will thus treaſure up ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny uſeful paſſages in your memory, which, on many occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the courſe of your lives, may be uſeful.</p>
            <p n="14">14. A very early acquaintance with the words of the Old and New Teſtament, even before any adequate ideas of their meaning have been obtained, has been found uſeful in ſubſequent life to the profeſſed divine.</p>
            <p n="15">15. And here I cannot but animadvert on the prevalent neglect of the Holy Scriptures; a neglect which too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly indicates a faint belief in the doctrines which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and which ought to animate every parent and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor in the buſineſs of infuſing religious ſentiments and a rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erence for the Scriptures, while the mind is moſt ſuſceptible of deep impreſſions.</p>
            <p n="16">16. You, who conſtitute a part of the riſing generation, will exert yourſelves in removing an evil which menaces the ruin of the national morals and proſperity. They in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed who are capable of a ſentiment ſo enlarged as this, exhibit a manlineſs of mind, which is the more honorable to them as it is uncommon at their age.</p>
            <p n="17">17. In the religious part of your education, it would be a diſgraceful omiſſion to neglect the catechiſm. I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to you as a uſeful, though humble guide, and I wiſh to warn you againſt that pride of heart which induces ſome perſons to ſlight it, and from that ſpirit of cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which cauſes in others a diſlike of all that contradicts their own particular perſuaſion.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Make it a rule, never to be violated, to pray night and morning. It is indeed true that in this, and other ſchools, it is uſual to begin and end the exerciſes of the day with prayer; but I am ſorry to ſay, that this is often conſidered as a mere formality. You will pay attention to this duty, and you will alſo repeat other prayers at ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down on your pillow and riſing from it.</p>
            <p n="19">
               <pb n="228" facs="unknown:026674_0228_0FD157094C1206E0"/>19. You will in vain expect ſucceſs in your ſtudies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs you implore a bleſſing on them from Heaven; or if you ſhould be permitted by Providence to make a proficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in knowledge for the ſake of others, you will not derive from your acquiſition that degree of happineſs which you would otherwiſe enjoy. You muſt aſk the Giver of every good gift for that moſt valuable gift of literary improvement.</p>
            <p n="20">20. You are apt at your age to be thoughtleſs. You enjoy health and ſpirits. You are ſtrangers to the cares of the world. Cheerfulneſs indeed becomes you; but let me prevail with you, when I entreat you to conſider the value of time, and the importance of making a good uſe of it.</p>
            <p n="21">21. Conſider your parents. Form an idea of the anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety which they feel on your account. You muſt have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved how eagerly they wiſh for your improvement. They feel a laudable ambition, which prompts them to deſire that you may arrive at eminence in whatever profeſſion or em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment you may hereafter be engaged by Providence.</p>
            <p n="22">22. To them it would be a painful ſight to ſee you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible and unſucceſsful. But nothing can vindicate you from contempt, or enſure your ſucceſs ſo effectually as perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al merit, or the qualities of a good diſpoſition, adorned with a competent ſhare of human learning and accompliſhments.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Your parents do all in their power to promote your improvement; but after all, they cannot but know that it remains with yourſelves to give efficacy and final good ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to their endeavors. The mind is not like a veſſel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which may be poured any quantity of whatever the poſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſeſſor chuſes to infuſe. It is rather like a plant, which, by the operation of its own internal powers, imbibes the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment afforded by the earth.</p>
            <p n="24">24. But, not to dwell on ſimilies, it is certain that your inſtructors can ſerve you only in conjunction with your own efforts. Let me then entreat you to exert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, if you have any regard for your parents, whoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs ſo eſſentially depends on your conduct; if you have any regard for your own honor, ſucceſs, and comfort; if you hope to be uſeful and reſpected in ſociety, and happy in a future ſtate.</p>
