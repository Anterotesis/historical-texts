            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>IT is now about a year and an half, ſince I was deſired by the General Aſſociation of Miniſters in this State to publiſh the following ſermons. As the publication has been ſo long delayed, I look upon myſelf bound to render the reaſons of this delay to the public in general, to the aſſociation and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribers in particular.—At the time that the deſire of the aſſociation was made known to me, the ſtate of our currency was ſuch, that I could not immediately determine, in what manner it was beſt to ſet on foot the ſubſcription. This being at length determined, the papers could not be circulated, ſubſcriptions procured and returned in a ſhorter time than ſeveral months. After this a further delay was occaſioned by the difficulty of procuring paper. However this difficulty was alſo at laſt ſurmounted, and the printer had begun the work, when on the fifth of July laſt, the Britiſh troops made their deſcent on New-Haven. This event entirely broke up the work; and as we have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly expoſed to another viſit from the enemy, the printer did not judge it prudent to reſume it. Things being ſo circumſtanced, I was obliged to ſeek out for another printer; and thoſe at Hartford being moſt conveniently ſituated, I app<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ed to them. They were willing to undertake the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but having work already in hand which would neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily conſume ſeveral months, they could not begin this, till <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, the publication of theſe ſermons, hath been thus long deferred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to the ſermons themſelves, they were not tranſcribed with any view to a publication in this country. In the year</hi> 1773, <hi>I was deſired by a gentleman in Scotland, to tranſcribe a number of the author's ſermons on ſome of the moſt plain, practical and experimental ſubjects, that they might be printed there. The reader will hence ſee, that it was not the deſign to pick out the moſt curious and elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diſcourſes, but thoſe of a different ſtamp. Among the very numerous diſcourſes on practical and experimental ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, out of which I was to chooſe, it was no eaſy taſk, to determine which to publiſh, and which to omit. And dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons would no doubt, in this caſe, judge different<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Many ſermons equally worthy of the light as theſe, were omitted; and perhaps ſome that were more worthy: Yet it is hoped that the public will judge theſe not unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of their acceptance and attention; if ſo, that may lay a foundation for the publication of others in due time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>The reader cannot be inſenſible of the diſadvantages at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending all poſthumous works, eſpecially ſermons, which are generally prepared only for the next ſabbath, and for a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular congregation, and often in great haſte and amidſt many avocations. Yet if in theſe ſermons he ſhall find the moſt important truths exhibited, and preſſed home on the conſcience with that pungency which tends to awaken, convince, humble and edify; if he ſhall find that ſerious ſtrain of piety, which in ſpite of himſelf, forces upon him, a ſerious frame of mind; if in the peruſal he cannot but be aſhamed and alarmed at himſelf, and in ſome meaſure feel the reality and weight of eternal things; if at leaſt, he like Agrippa ſhall be almoſt perſuaded to be a chriſtian:—I preſume he will not grudge the expence of the purchaſe, nor the time requiſite to peruſe what is now offered him. Theſe if I miſtake not, are the great ends to be aimed at in

                  </gap> are ends which can never be accompliſhed by thoſe modern faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſcourſes which are delivered under the name of ſermons, but really are mere harangues on ſuch moral ſubjects, as have been much better handled by</hi> Cicero, Seneca, <hi>or the</hi> Spectator; <hi>and contain very little more of the goſpel, than is to be found in the heathen philoſophers.—That the important ends now mentioned may be indeed accompliſhed by this publication to every reader, is the ſincere deſire of the publick's humble ſervant,</hi>

To this obedience the apoſtle refers in the 11th ch. of H b. 7th v. By faith Noah being warned of GOD of things not ſeen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the ſaving of his houſe.</p>
            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <p>WE ſhould be willing to engage in, and go through with great undertakings, in order to our own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>THE building of the ark, which was enjoined up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Noah, that he and his family might be ſaved, was a great undertaking: The ark was a building of vaſt ſize; the length of it being three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits. A cubit, till of late, was by learned men reckoned to be equal to a foot and an half of our meaſure. But lately ſome learned men of our nation have travelled into Egypt, and other antient countries, and have meaſured ſome antient buildings there, which are of ſeveral thouſand years ſtanding, and of which antient hiſtories give us the dimenſions in cubits; particularly the pyramids of Egypt, which are ſtanding entire at this day. By meaſuring theſe, and by comparing the meaſure in feet, with the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent accounts of their meaſure in cubits, a cubit is found to be almoſt two and twenty inches. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore learned men more lately reckon a cubit much longer than they did formerly. So that the ark reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016767_0007_0F9E1EDE86AA6BC0"/>
ſo much longer every way, will appear to be almoſt of double the bulk, which was formerly aſcribed to it. According to this computation of the cubit, it was more than five hundred and fifty feet long, about ninety feet broad, and about fifty feet in height.</p>
               <p>To build ſuch a ſtructure, with all thoſe apartments and diviſions in it which were neceſſary, and in ſuch a manner as to be fit to float upon the water, for ſo long a time, was a great undertaking. It was a work of much time, taking Noah with all the workmen he employed an hundred and twenty years, or therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts, to build it. For ſo long it was, that the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of GOD ſtrove, and the long-ſuffering of GOD waited on the old world; as you may ſee in Gen. vi. 3. My ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man; yet his days ſhall be one hundred and twenty years. All this while the ark was a prepairing, as appears by I Pet. iii. 20. When once the long ſuffering of GOD waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring. It was a long time that Noah conſtantly employed himſelf in this buſineſs. Men would eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem that undertaking very great, which ſhould keep them conſtantly employed even for one half of that time.</p>
               <p>NOAH muſt have had a great and conſtant care upon his mind for theſe one hundred and twenty years, in ſuperintending this work, and ſeeing that all was done exactly according to the directions, which GOD had given him.</p>
               <p>NOT only was Noah himſelf continually employed, but it is judged by learned men from the computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they have made, that it required a great number of workmen to be conſtantly employed, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all that time, in procuring, and collecting, and fitting the materials, and in putting them together in
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016767_0008_0F9E1EDE99A94660"/>
due form. How great a thing was it for Noah to undertake ſuch a work, which kept him and ſo many others buſily employed for ſo long a time! For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the continual care and labour, it was a work of vaſt expence. It is not probable that any of that wicked generation would put to a finger to help for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſuch a work, which doubtleſs they believed was merely the fruit of Noah's folly, without full wages. Noah muſt needs have been very rich, to be able to bear the expence of ſuch a work, and to pay ſo many workmen for ſo long a time. It would have been a very great expence for a prince; and doubtleſs Noah was very rich, as Abraham and Job were afterwards. But it is probable that Noah ſpent all his worldly ſubſtance in this work, thus mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting his faith in the word of GOD, by ſelling all he had; as believing there would ſurely come a flood, which would deſtroy all; ſo that if he ſhould keep what he had, it would be of no ſervice to him. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he has ſet us an example, ſhewing us how we ought to ſell all for our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>NOAH'S undertaking was an undertaking of great difficulty, as it expoſed him to the continual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of all his neighbours, for that whole one hundred and twenty years. None of them believed what he told them of a flood which was about to drown the world, as this was a thing the like of which had never been from the begining of the world to that time. For a man to undertake ſuch a vaſt piece of work, under a notion that it ſhould be the means of ſaving him, when the world ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, it made him the continual laughing ſtock of the world. When he was about to hire workmen, doubtleſs all laughed at him, and we may ſuppoſe that though the workmen conſented to work for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016767_0009_0F9E1EE138BE17B0"/>
yet they laughed at the folly of him who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed them. When the ark was begun, we may ſuppoſe that every one that paſſed by and ſaw ſuch an huge hulk ſtand there, laughed at it, calling it <hi>Noah's folly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN theſe days men are with difficulty brought to do or ſubmit to that which makes them the objects of the reproach of all their neighbours. Indeed if while ſome reproach them, others ſtand by them and honour them, this will ſupport them. But it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for a man to go on in a way, wherein he makes himſelf the laughing ſtock of the whole world, and wherein he can find none who do not deſpiſe him. Where is the man that can ſtand the ſho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>k of ſuch a trial for twenty years? Much more may I aſk, where ſhall he be found, who will ſtand it for one hundred and twenty years?</p>
               <p>BUT in ſuch an undertaking as this Noah at the divine direction engaged, and went through it, that himſelf and his family might be ſaved from that common deſtruction, which was ſhortly about to come on the world He began, and alſo made an end<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> According to all that GOD commanded him, ſo did he. Length of time did not weary him: He did not grow weary of his vaſt expence. He ſtood the ſhock of the deriſion of all his neighbours, and of all the world, year after year: He did not grow weary of being their laughing ſtock, ſo as to give over his enterprize; but perſevered in it, till the ark was finiſhed. After this, he was at the trouble and charge of procuring ſtores for the maintenance of his family, and of all the various kinds of creatures for ſo long a time. Such an undertaking he engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in and went through in order to a <hi>temporal</hi> ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How great an undertaking then ſhould men
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016767_0010_0F9E1EE25C17D560"/>
be willing to engage in and go through in order to their <hi>eternal</hi> ſalvation! A ſalvation from an eternal deluge; from being overwhelmed with the billows of GOD'S wrath, of which Noah's flood was but a ſhadow.</p>
               <p>BUT I ſhall particularly handle this doctrine under the three following propoſitions.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. THERE is a work or buſineſs, which muſt be undertaken and accompliſhed by men, if they would be ſaved.</item>
                  <item>II. THIS buſineſs is a great undertaking.</item>
                  <item>III. MEN ſhould be willing to enter upon and go through this undertaking; though it be great, ſeeing it is for their own ſalvation.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I. PROP. There is a work or buſineſs, which men muſt enter upon and accompliſh, in order to their ſalvation.—Men have no reaſon to expect to be ſaved in idleneſs, or to go to heaven in a way of doing nothing. No; in order to it, there is a great work, which muſt not only be begun, but muſt be finiſhed.</p>
               <p>I SHALL ſpeak upon this propoſition, in anſwer to two enquiries.</p>
               <p>ENQ. I. What is this work o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> buſineſs, which muſt be undertaken and accompliſhed in order to the ſalvation of men?</p>
               <p>ANS. It is the work of ſeeking ſalvation in a way of a thorough and conſtant obſervance of all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to which GOD directs us in his word. If we would be ſaved, we muſt ſeek ſalvation. For al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though men do not obtain heaven of themſelves, yet they do not go thither accidentally, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:016767_0011_0F9E1EE322432610"/>
or endeavours of their own. GOD in his word hath directed men to ſeek their ſalvation as they would hope to obtain it. There is a race that is ſet before them, which they muſt run, and in that race come off victors, in order to their winning the prize.</p>
               <p>THE ſcriptures have told us what particular duties muſt be performed by us, in order to our ſalvation. It is not ſufficient that men ſeek their ſalvation only in the obſervance of ſome of thoſe duties; but they muſt be obſerved univerſally. The work we have to do, is not an obedience only to ſome, but to all the commands of GOD; a compliance with every inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of worſhip; a diligent uſe of all the appointed means of grace; a doing of all duty towards GOD and towards man.—It is not ſufficient that men have ſome reſpect to all the commands of GOD, and that they may be ſaid to ſeek their ſalvation in ſome ſort of obſervance of all the commands; but they muſt be <hi>devoted</hi> to it. They muſt not make this a buſineſs by the <hi>by,</hi> or a thing in which they are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and careleſs, or which they do with a ſlack hand; but it muſt be their great buſineſs, being at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to as their great concern. They muſt not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſeek, but ſtrive; they muſt do what their hand findeth to do with their might, as men thoroughly engaged in their minds, and influenced and ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward by great deſire and ſtrong reſolution. They muſt act as thoſe that ſee ſo much of the importance of the things of religion above all other things, that every thing elſe muſt be as an occaſional affair, and nothing muſt ſtand in competition with the duties of religion. This muſt be the one thing they do; Phil. iii. 13. This one thing I do.—It muſt be the buſineſs to which they are given up, which they follow daily as their great work, to which they make
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016767_0012_0F9E1EE3E8EF9188"/>
all other affairs give place, and to which they are ready to make other things a ſacrifice. They muſt be ready to part with pleaſures, and honor, and eſtate, and life, and to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ell all that they may ſucceſsfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this buſineſs.</p>
               <p>IT is required of every man, that he not only do ſomething in this buſineſs, but that he ſhould <hi>devote</hi> himſelf to it, which imples that he ſhould give up himſelf to it, give up all his affairs, and all his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral enjoyments. This is the import of taking up the croſs, of taking CHRIST'S yoke upon us, and of denying ourſelves to follow CHRIST. The rich young man, who came kneeling to CHRIST, to know what he ſhould do to be ſaved (Mark x. 17.) in ſome ſenſe ſought ſalvation, but did not obtain it. He in ſome ſenſe kept all the commands from his youth up; but he was not cordially devoted to this buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. He had not made a ſacrifice to it of all his enjoyments, as appeared when CHRIST came to try him; he would not part with his eſtate for him.</p>
               <p>IT is not only neceſſary that men ſhould ſeem to be very much engaged, and appear as if they were devoted to their duty for a little while; but there muſt be a <hi>conſtant</hi> devotedneſs; they muſt be devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this work in a perſevering way, as Noah was to the buſineſs of building the ark, going on with that great, difficult, and expenſive affair, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out through the one hundred and twenty years, till it was finiſhed, and till the flood came.—Men muſt not only be diligent in the uſe of the means of grace, and be anxiouſly engaged to eſcape eternal ruin, till they obtain hope and comfort; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they muſt perſevere in the duties of religion, till the flood come, the flood of death.—Not only muſt the faculties, ſtrength, and poſſeſſions of men
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016767_0013_0F9E1EE4DC16CBC0"/>
be devoted to this work; but alſo their time and their lives: They muſt give up their whole lives to it, even to the very day when GOD cauſes it to rain on the earth, and the ſtorms and floods come. This is the work or buſineſs, which men have to do, in order to their ſalvation.</p>
               <p>ENQ. 2. Why is it needful that men ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to go through ſuch a work in order to their ſalvation?</p>
               <p>ANS. I. Negatively; not to merit ſalvation, or to recommend them to the ſaving mercy of GOD. Men are not ſaved on the account of any work of theirs, and yet they are not ſaved without works. If we merely conſider what it is for which, or on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of which men are ſaved, no work at all in men is neceſſary to their ſalvation. In this reſpect they are ſaved wholly without any work of theirs. Tit. iii. 5. Not by works of righteouſneſs, which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us, by the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>IF we enquire what we muſt be ſaved on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of, the anſwer is on the account of works: but not our own works, not on the account of any works which we have done or can do; but on the account of the works which CHRIST hath done for us. Works are the fixed price of eternal life, fixed in the beginning when GOD made man. And GOD hath never altered that price: it is fixed by an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, unalterable rule of righteouſneſs. But ſince the fall there is no hope of our doing theſe works. As to us ſalvation is offered freely without money and without price. It is offered to be made ſure to us, upon the ſole condition of our acceptance of it. Whoſoever will, may come and take of the water of life freely.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="16" facs="unknown:016767_0014_0F9E1EE57261BC50"/>
2. AFFIRMATIVELY; this is the way to ſalvation which GOD hath appointed. Though it be not needful that we do any thing to merit ſalvation, which CHRIST hath fully merited for all who believe in him; or that we ſhould do any thing, for which, or on the account of the goodneſs of which we may be ſaved; yet GOD for wiſe and holy ends hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, that we ſhould come to ſalvation in no other way, but that of good works done by us.</p>
               <p>GOD did not ſave Noah on account of the labour and expence he was at in building the ark. Noah's ſalvation from the flood was an inſtance of the free and diſtinguiſhing mercy of GOD. Nor did GOD ſtand in need of Noah's care, or coſt, or labour to build an ark. The ſame power, which created the world, and which brought the flood o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> waters upon the earth, could have made the ark <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> an inſtant, without any care or coſt of Noah, or any of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of thoſe many workmen, who were employed for ſo long a time. Yet GOD was pleaſed to appoint, that Noah ſhould be ſaved in this way.—So GOD hath appointed that man ſhould not be ſaved, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> his undertaking and doing this work, of which I have been ſpeaking; and therefore we are command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>to work out our own ſalvation with fear and trembling,</hi> Philip. ii. 12.</p>
               <p>THERE are many wiſe ends to be anſwered by the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a work or buſineſs as pre-re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ſalvation.—The glory of GOD required it. For although GOD ſtands in no need of any thing that men do, to recommend them to his ſaving mercy; yet it would reflect much on the glory of GOD'S wiſdom and holineſs, to beſtow ſalvation on men in ſuch a way as tends to encourage them in ſloth and wickedneſs; or in any other way than that
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016767_0015_0F9E1EE6282538C0"/>
which tends to promote diligence and holineſs. Man was made capable of action, with many powers of both body and mind fitting him for it. He was made for buſineſs and not idleneſs: and the main buſineſs for which he was made, was the buſineſs of religion. Therefore it becometh the wiſdom of GOD to beſtow ſalvation and happineſs on men, in ſuch a way as tends moſt to promote his anſwering his end in this reſpect, and to ſtir him up to a diligent uſe of his faculties and talents.</p>
               <p>IT becometh the wiſdom of GOD ſo to order it, that things of great value and importance ſhould not be obtained without great labour and diligence. GOD hath wiſely ſo ordered in other things. So much as human learning and great moral accompliſhments are not to be obtained, without much care and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. It is wiſely ſo ordered to maintain in man a due ſenſe of the value of thoſe things which are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. If great things were in common eaſily to be obtained, it would have a tendency to cauſe men to ſlight and undervalue them. Men commonly deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe thoſe things, which are cheap, and which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without difficulty.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH the work which hath been ſpoken of, performed by men, be not neceſſary in order to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſalvation; yet it is neceſſary in order to their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prepared for it. This is one reaſon why GOD appointed it as abſolutely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> in order to it. Men cannot be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> hath been deſcribed. This is neceſſary in order that they have a proper ſenſe of their own neceſſities, and unworthineſs; and in order that they be prepared and diſpoſed to prize ſalvation, when beſtowed, and that they be properly thankful to GOD for it. The requiſition of ſo great a work in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016767_0016_0F9E1EE7526169F0"/>
order to our ſalvation is no way inconſiſtent with the freedom of the offer of ſalvation; as after all, it is both offered and beſtowed without any reſpect to our work, as the price or meritorious cauſe of our ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as I have already explained. Beſides, ſalvation beſtowed in this way is better for us, more for our advantage and happineſs, both in this and the future world, than if it were given without this requiſition.</p>
               <p>II. PROP. This work or buſineſs, which muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e done in order to the ſalvation of men, is a great undertaking. It often appears ſo to men upon whom it is urged. Utterly to break off from all their ſins, and to give up themſelves for ever to the buſineſs of religion, without making a reſerve of any one luſt, ſubmitting to and complying with every command of GOD, in all caſes, and perſevering therein; appears to many ſo great a thing, that they are in vain urged to undertake it. In ſo doing it ſeems to them, that they ſhould give up themſelves to a perpetual bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage and eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> throw themſelves away. The greater part of men therefore chooſe to put it off, and keep it at as great a diſtance as they can. They cannot bear to think of entering immediately on ſuch an hard ſervice, and rather than do it, they will run the riſk of eternal damnation, by putting it off to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain future opportunity.</p>
               <p>ALTHOUGH the buſineſs of religion is far from really being as it appears to ſuch men; for the devil will be ſure, if he can, to repreſent it in falſe colours to ſinners, and make it appear as black and terrible as he can; yet it is indeed a great buſineſs, a great undertaking; and it is fit that all, who are urged to it, ſhould count the coſt beforehand and be ſenſible of the difficulty attending it. For though the devil diſcourages many from this undertaking, by repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016767_0017_0F9E1EE7BB6D16C8"/>
it to be more difficult than it really is; yet with others he takes a contrary courſe, and flatters them it is a very eaſy thing, a trivial buſineſs, which may be done at any time, when they pleaſe; and ſo emboldens them to defer it from that conſideration. But let none imagine any other or conceive any other notion of that buſineſs of religion, which is abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to their ſalvation, than that it is a great undertaking. It is ſo in the following accounts.</p>
               <p n="1">1. IT is a buſineſs of great labour and care. There are many commands to be obeyed, many duties to be done, duties to GOD, duties to our neighbour, and duties to ourſelves. There is much oppoſition in the way of theſe duties from <hi>without.</hi> There is a ſubtil and powerful adverſary laying all manner of blocks in the way. There are innumerable temptations of ſatan to be reſiſted and repelled. There is great oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the world; innumerable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> laid on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide; many rocks and mountains to be paſſed over, many ſtreams to be paſſed through, and many flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and enticements from a vain world to be reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. There is great oppoſition from <hi>within;</hi> a dull and ſluggiſh heart, which is exceeding averſe from that activity in religion, which is neceſſary; a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> heart, which is averſe from religion and ſpiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, and continually drawing the contrary way; and a proud and a deceitful heart, in which corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will be exerting itſelf in all manner of ways. So that nothing can be done to any effect without a moſt ſtrict and careful watch, great labour and ſtrife.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT is a conſtant buſineſs.—In that buſineſs which requires great labour, men love now and then to have a ſpace of relaxation, that they may reſt from their extraordinary labour. But this is a buſineſs which muſt be followed every day. Luke ix. 23.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016767_0018_0F9E1EE8D0A61D90"/>
If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs <hi>daily,</hi> and follow me. We muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give ourſelves any relaxation from this buſineſs; it muſt be continually proſecuted day after day. If ſometimes we make a great ſtir and buſtle concerning religion, but then lay all aſide to take our caſe, and do ſo from time to time; it will be of no good effect: we had e'en as good do nothing at all. The buſineſs of religion ſo followed is never like to come to any good iſſue, nor is the work eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

               <p n="3">3. IT is a great undertaking, as it is an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, often at the expenſe of our ſubſtance, of our credit among men, the good will of our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, at the expenſe of all our earthly friends, and even at the expenſe of life itſelf.—Herein it is like Noah's undertaking to build the ark, which as hath been ſhown was a coſtly undertaking: it was expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to his reputation among men, expoſing him to be the continual laughing ſtock of all his neighbours and of the whole world: and it was expenſive to his eſtate, and probably coſt him all that he had.</p>
               <p n="4">4. SOMETIMES the fear, trouble and exerciſe of mind, which are undergone reſpecting this buſineſs, and the ſalvation of the ſoul, are great and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, before any comfort is obtained. Sometimes perſons in this ſituation labour long in the dark, and ſometimes, as it were, in the very fire, they having great diſtreſs of conſcience, great fears, and many perplexing temptations, before they obtain light and comfort to lighten their buſineſs, and make their care and labour more eaſy to them.

they ſeek it not in a right manner, nor in the right objects. GOD therefore hides his face. They cry, but GOD doth not anſwer their prayers. They ſtrive, but all ſeems in vain. They ſeem to themſelves not at all to get forward, or nearer to a deliverance from ſin; but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>MANY after they have obtained ſome ſaving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, are again involved in darkneſs and trouble. It is with them as it was with the chriſtian Hebrews, of whom we read Heb. x. 32. After ye were illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ye endured, a great fight of afflictions. Some through a melancholy habit and diſtemper of body, together with ſatan's temptations, ſpend a great part of their lives in diſtreſs and darkneſs, even after they have had ſome ſaving comfort.</p>
               <p n="5">5. IT is a buſineſs, which by reaſon of the many difficulties, ſnares and dangers that attend it, requires much inſtruction conſideration and counſel. There is no buſineſs wherein men ſtand in need of counſel more than in this. It is a difficult undertaking, an hard matter to proceed aright in it. There are ten thouſand wrong ways, which men may take; there are many labyrinths wherein many poor ſouls are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled and never find the way out; there are many rocks on which thouſands of ſouls have ſuffered ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck, for want of having ſteered a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ight.</p>
               <p>MEN of themſelves know not how to proceed in this buſineſs, any more than the children of Iſrael in the wilderneſs know where to go without the gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016767_0020_0F9E1EEA4FB5ED48"/>
of the pillar of cloud and fire. There is great need that they ſearch the ſcriptures and give diligent heed to the inſtructions and directions contained in them as to a light ſhining in a dark place; and that they aſk counſel of thoſe ſkilled in theſe matters. And there is no buſineſs in which men have ſo much need of ſeeking to GOD by prayer, for his counſel, and that he would lead them in the right way and ſhow them the ſtrait gate. For ſtrait is the gate and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it. Yea there are none that find it without direction from heaven.</p>
               <p>THE building of the ark was a work of great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty on this account, that Noah's wiſdom was not ſufficient to direct him, how to make ſuch a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſhould be a ſufficient ſecurity againſt ſuch a flood, and which ſhould be a convenient dwelling place for himſelf, his family and all the various kinds of beaſts and birds, and creeping things. Nor could he ever have known how to conſtruct this building, had not GOD directed him.</p>
               <p n="6">6. THIS buſineſs never ends till life ends. They that undertake this laborious, careful expenſive, ſelf denying buſineſs muſt not expect to reſt from their labours, till death ſhall have put an end to them. The long continuance of the work which Noah un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook was what eſpecially made it a great undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing This alſo was what made the travel of the children of Iſrael through the wilderneſs appear ſo great to them, that it was continued for ſo long a time. Their ſpirits failed they were diſcouraged, and had not an heart to go through with ſo great an undertaking.</p>
               <p>BUT ſuch is this buſineſs that it runs parallel with life, whether it be longer or ſhorter. Although we
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:016767_0021_0F9E1EEAB34D2DC0"/>
ſhould live to a great age, our race and warfare will not be finiſhed, till death ſhall come. We muſt not expect that an end will be put to our labour, and care, and ſtrife by any hope of a good eſtate, which we may obtain. Paſt attainments, and paſt ſucceſs will not excuſe us from what remains for the future, nor will they make future, conſtant labour and care not neceſſary to our ſalvation.</p>
               <p>III. MEN ſhould be willing to engage in and go through this buſineſs, however great and difficult it may ſeem to them, ſeeing it is for their own ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Becauſe,</p>
               <p n="1">1. A DELUGE of wrath will ſurely come. The inhabitants of the old world would not believe that there would come ſuch a flood of waters upon the earth, as that of which Noah told them, though he told them often; neither would they take any care to avoid the deſtruction. Yet ſuch a deluge did come; nothing of all thoſe things, of which Noah had fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned them, failed.</p>
               <p>So there will ſurely come a more dreadful deluge of divine wrath on this wicked world. We are often forewarned of it in the ſcriptures, and the world is as the world was then, it doth not believe any ſuch thing. Yet the threatening will as certainly be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, as the threatening denounced againſt the old world. A day of wrath is coming; it will come at its appointed ſeaſon; it will not tarry, it ſhall not be delayed one moment beyond its appointed time.</p>
               <p n="2">2. ALL ſuch as do not ſeaſonably undertake and go through that great work, which has been ſpoken of, will ſurely be ſwallowed up in this deluge. When the floods of wrath ſhall come, they will uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally overwhelm the wicked world: all ſuch as ſhall not have taken care to prepare an ark; will
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:016767_0022_0F9E1EEB847A4168"/>
ſurely be ſwallowed up in it: they will find no other way of eſcape. In vain ſhall ſalvation be expected from the hills and from the multitude of mountains. For the flood ſhall be above the tops of all the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. If they ſhall climb up the tops of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, thence ſhall they be brought down; for the waters will riſe above their heads. Or if they ſhall hide themſelves in the caves and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the mountains, there the waters of the flood will find them out, will come in upon them fill up thoſe caves, and there ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> miſerably periſh.</p>
               <p>As thoſe of the old world that were not in the ark periſhed, agreeably to Gen. vii. 21, 22, 23. So all who ſhall not have ſecured to themſelves a place in the ſpiritual ark of the goſpel, ſhall periſh much more miſerably than the old world.—Doubtleſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the old world had many contrivances to ſave themſelves. Some we may ſuppoſe aſcended to the tops of their houſes, being driven <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut of one ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to another, till at laſt they periſhed in the higheſt ſtory. Others climed to the tops of high towers; who yet were waſhed thence by the boiſterous waves of the riſing flood. Some climed to the tops of trees; others to the tops of mountains, and eſpecially of the higheſt mountains. But all was in vain; the flood ſooner or later ſwallowed them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>l up: only Noah and his family, who had taken care to prepare an ark, remained alive.</p>
               <p>So it will doubtleſs be at the end of the world, when CHRIST ſhall come to judge the world in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Some, when they ſhall look up and ſee him coming in the clouds of heaven, ſhall hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in cloſets, and ſecret places in their houſes. Others flying to the caves and dens of the earth, ſhall attempt to hide themſelves there. Others ſhall call upon the rocks and mountains to fall on them,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:016767_0023_0F9E1EEC36411960"/>
and cover them from the face of him that ſitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the lamb.—So it will be after the ſentence is pronounced and wicked men ſee that terrible fire a coming, which is to burn this world for ever, and which will be a deluge of fire, and will burn the earth even to the bottoms of the mountains, and to its very centre, agreeably to Deut xxxii 22. For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and ſhall burn unto the loweſt hell, and ſhall conſume the earth with her increaſe, and ſet on fire the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the mountains. I ſay, when the wicked ſhall, after the ſentence, ſee this great fire coming and beginning to kindle, and to take hold of this earth; there will be many contrivances deviſed by them to eſcape: ſome flying to caves and holes in the earth, ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iding themſelves in one place, and ſome in another. But let them hide themſelves where they will, or let them do what they will, it will be utterly in vain. Every cave ſhall burn as an oven, the rocks and mountains ſhall melt with fervent heat; and if they could creep down to the very centre of the earth, ſtill the heat would follow them, and rage with as much vehemence there, as on the very ſurface.</p>
               <p>So when wicked men, who neglect their great work in their lifetime, who are not willing to go through the difficulty and labour of this work, draw near to death, they ſometimes do many things to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape death, and put forth many endeavours to lengthen out their lives at leaſt a little longer. For this end they ſend for phyſicians, and perhaps many are conſulted, and their preſcriptions are punctually obſerved. Beſide theſe things, they alſo uſe many endeavours to ſave their ſouls from hell. They cry to GOD; they confeſs their paſt ſins; they promiſe future reformation; and, O, what would they not
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:016767_0024_0F9E1EED061910D0"/>
give for ſome ſmall addition to their lives, or ſome hope of future happineſs. But all proves in vain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> GOD hath numbered their days and finiſhed them; and as they have ſinned away the day of grace, they muſt even bear the conſequence, and for ever lie down in ſorrow.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE deſtruction, when it ſhall come, will be infinitely terrible. The deſtruction of the old world by the flood was terrible. But that eternal deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is coming on the wicked is infinitely more terrible. That flood of waters was but an image of this awful flood of divine vengeance. When the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters poured down out of heaven, more like ſpouts or cataracts, or the waters pouring down the falls of a great river, than like rain; it was very terrifying. When the windows of heaven were opened and the waters were poured down in torrents or cataracts, what an awful appearance was there of the wrath of GOD. This however is but an image of that terrible out pouring of the wrath of GOD, which ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, yea forever and ever, on wicked men. And when the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the waters burſt forth out of the ground, as though they had iſſued out of the womb, as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Job xxxviii. 8. This was an image of the mighty breakings forth of GOD'S wrath, which ſhall be, when the flood-gates of wrath ſhall be drawn up. How may we ſuppoſe that the wicked of the old world repented, that they had not hearkened to the warnings which Noah had given them, when they ſaw theſe dreadful things, and ſaw that they muſt periſh! How much more will you repent your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to hearken to the gracious warnings of the goſpel, when you ſhall ſee the fire of GOD'S wrath againſt you, pouring down from heaven and burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on all ſides out of the bowels of the earth!</p>

                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:016767_0025_0F9E1EEDA3B8DDF0"/>
4. THOUGH the work which is neceſſary in order to man's ſalvation be a great work, yet it is not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. What was required of Noah, doubtleſs appeared a very great and difficult undertaking. Yet he undertook it with reſolution, and he was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through it. So if we undertake this work with the ſame goodwill and reſolution, we ſhall undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly be ſucceſsful. However difficult it be, yet multitudes have gone through it, and have obtained ſalvation by the means. It is not a work beyond what we are capable of by the faculties of our nature, nor beyond the opportunities, which GOD giveth us. If men will but take warning and hearken to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, if they will but be ſincere and in good earneſt, be ſeaſonable in their work, take their opportunities, uſe their advantages, be ſteadfaſt and not wavering; they ſhall not fail.</p>

               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>THE uſe I would make of this doctrine is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort all to undertake and go through this great work, which they have to do in order to their ſalvation, and this, let the work ſeem ever ſo great and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult. If your nature be averſe to it, and there ſeems to be very frightful things in the way, ſo that your heart is ready to fail at the proſpect; yet ſeriouſly conſider what has been ſaid, and act a wiſe part. Seeing it is for yourſelves, for your own ſalvation; ſeeing it is for ſo great a ſalvation, for your deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from eternal deſtruction; and ſeeing it is of ſuch abſolute neceſſity in order to your ſalvation, that the deluge of divine wrath will come and there will b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

it with your might, and go through it, though this cannot be done without great labour, care, difficulty, and expenſe?</p>
               <p>I WOULD by no means flatter you concerning this work, or go about to make you believe, that you ſhall find an eaſy, light buſineſs of it: No, I would not have you expect any ſuch thing. I would have you ſit down and count the coſt; and if you cannot find it in your hearts, to engage in a great, hard, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious and expenſive undertaking, and to perſevere in it to the end of life; pretend not to be religious. Indulge yourſelves in your eaſe; follow your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; eat, drink and be merry; e'en conclude to go to hell in that way, and never make any more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of ſeeking your ſalvation. Here conſider ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things in particular.</p>
               <p n="1">1. HOW often you have been warned of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching flood of GOD'S wrath. How frequently have you been told of hell, have heard the threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the word of GOD ſet before you, and have been warned to flee from the wrath to come. It is with you, as it was with the inhabitants of the old world. Noah warned them abundantly of the approaching flood, and cou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>elled them to take care for their ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. 1 Pet. iii. 19. 20.—Noah warned them in words; and not only ſo, he preached to them and warned them in his actions. His building the ark, which took him ſo long a time, and in which he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed ſo many hands, was a ſtanding warning to them. All the blows of the hammer and ax, during the progreſs of that building, were ſo many calls and warnings to the old world, to take care for their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation from the approaching deſtruction. Every knock of the workmen was a knock of JESUS CHRIST at the door of their hearts. But they would not

hearken: all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ſe warnings, though repeated every day and continued for ſo long a time, availed nothing.</p>
               <p>NOW is it not much ſo with you, as it was with them? How often have you been warned? how have you heard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>he warning knocks of the goſpel, ſabbath after ſabbath for theſe many years? Yet how have ſome of you no more regarded them, than the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the old world regarded the noiſe of the workmen's tools in Noah's ark!</p>
               <p>OBJECTION. But here poſſibly it may be objected by ſome, that though it be true, they have often been told of hell, yet they never ſaw any thing of it, and therefore they cannot realize it, that there is any ſuch place. They have often heard of hell, and are told that wicked men, when they die, go to a moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place of torment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; that hereafter there will be a day of judgment, and that the world will be conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by fire. But how do they know that it is really ſo? How do they know what becomes of theſe wicked men that die? None of them come back to tell them. They have nothing to depend on, but the word which they hear. And how do they know that all is not a cunningly deviſed ſable.</p>
               <p>ANSW. The ſinners of the old world had the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame objection againſt what Noah told them of a flood about to drown the world. Yet the bare word of GOD proved to be ſufficient evidence that ſuch a thing was coming. What was the reaſon that none of the many millions then upon earth, believed what Noah ſaid, but this, that it was a ſtrange thing, that no ſuch thing had ever before been known? And what a ſtrange ſtory muſt that of Noah have appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, wherein he told them of a deluge of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters above the tops of the mountains! Therefore it is ſaid Heb. xi. 7. That Noah was warned of GOD of
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:016767_0028_0F9E1EEFD9816758"/>
things not ſeen as yet. It is probable, none could conceive how it could be that the whole world ſhould be drowned in a flood of waters; and all were ready to aſk, where there was water enough for it; and by what means it ſhould be brought upon the earth. Noah did not tell them how it ſhould be brought to paſs: he only told them that GOD had ſaid, that it ſhould be: and that proved to be enough. The event ſhewed their folly in not depending on the mere word of GOD, who was able, who kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w how to bring it to paſs, and who could not lie.</p>
               <p>IN like manner the word of GOD will prove true in threatning a flood of eternal wrath, to overwhelm all the wicked. You will believe it, when the event ſhall prove it, when it ſhall be too late to profit by the belief. The word of GOD will never fail; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is ſo ſure as that; heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but the word of GOD ſhall not paſs away. It is firmer than mountains of braſs. At the end the viſion will ſpeak and not lie. <q>The decree ſhall bring forth,</q> and all wicked men ſhall know that GOD is the LORD, that he is a GOD of truth, and that they are fools who will not depend on his word. The wicked of the old world counted Noah a fool for depending ſo much on the word of GOD, as to put himſelf to all the fatigue and expenſe of building the ark; but the event ſhowed that they themſelves were the fools, and that he was wiſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. CONSIDER that the ſpirit of GOD will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtrive with you; nor will his long ſuffering al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways wait upon you. SO GOD ſaid concerning the inhabitants of the old world; Gen. vi. 3. My ſpirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man, for that he alſo is fleſh; yet his days ſhall be one hundred and twenty years. All this while GOD was ſtriving with them.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:016767_0029_0F9E1EF305867590"/>
It was a day of grace with them, and GOD'S long ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, all this while, waited upon them; as appears by 1 Pet. iii. 20. Which ſome time were diſobedient, when once the long ſuffering of GOD waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing. All this while they had an opportunity to eſcape, if they would but hearken and believe GOD.</p>
               <p>EVEN after the ark was finiſhed, which ſeems to have been but little before the flood came, ſtill there was an opportunity; the door of the ark ſtood open for ſome time. After the ark was finiſhed there was ſometime, during which Noah was employed in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up ſtores in the ark Even then it was not too late; the door of the ark yet ſtood open.—About a week before the flood came, Noah was commanded to begin to gather in the beaſts and birds. During this laſt week ſtill the door of the ark ſtood open.—But on the very day that the flood began to come, while the rain was yet withheld, Noah and his wife, his three ſons and their wives, went into the ark, and we are told, Gen. vii. 16. That GOD ſhut him in. Then the day of GOD'S patience was paſt; the door of the ark was ſhut; GOD himſelf, who ſhuts and no man opens, ſhut the door. Then all hope of their eſcaping the flood was paſt. Then, after that, it was too late to repent that they had not hearkened to Noah's warnings, and had not entered into the ark, while the door ſtood open.</p>
               <p>AFTER Noah and his family had entered into the ark, and GOD had ſhut them in, after the windows of heaven were opened, and they ſaw how the waters were poured down out of heaven, we may ſuppoſe that then many of thoſe who were near, come running to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of the ark, knocking at the door, and crying moſt piteouſly for entrance. But it was too
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:016767_0030_0F9E1EF51CB87290"/>
late; GOD himſelf had ſhut the door, and Noah had no licence, and probably no power, to open it. We may ſuppoſe, they ſtood knocking and calling <hi>Open to us, Open to us; O let us in; we beg that we may be let in.</hi> And probably ſome of them pleaded old acquaintance with Noah; that they had always been his neighbours, and had even helped him to build the ark. But all was in vain. There they flood, till the waters of the flood came, without mercy ſwept them away from the door of the ark, and ſwallowed them up.</p>
               <p>So it will be with you, if you continue to refuſe to hearken to the warnings, which are given you. Now GOD is ſtriving with you. Now he is warning you of the approaching flood and calling upon you ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath after ſabbath. Now the door of the ark ſtands open. But GOD'S ſpirit will not always ſtrive with you: his long ſuffering will not always wait upon you. There is an appointed day of GOD'S patience, which is as certainly limited, as it was to the old world. GOD hath ſet your bounds which you cannot paſs.

               <p>IF you improve not your opportunity before that time, you will cry in vain, Lord, Lord, open to us. Mat. x. 11, 12. and Luke xiii. 25, &amp;c—While you ſhall ſtand at the door with your piteous cries, the flood of GOD'S wrath will come upon you, overwhelm you and you ſhall not eſcape. The tempeſt ſhall carry you away without mercy, and you ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſwallowed up and loſt.</p>

3. CONSIDER how mighty the billows of divine wrath will be, when they ſhall come. The waters of Noah's flood were very great. The deluge was vaſt; it was very deep; the billows reached as it were to the very heavens, being fifteen cubits above the higheſt mountains; and it was an ocean which had no ſhores; ſignifying the greatneſs of that wrath, which is coming on wicked men in another world, which will be like a mighty flood of waters, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming them, and riſing vaſtly high over their heads, with billows reaching to the very heavens. Thoſe billows will be bigger, and higher, and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier than mountains on their poor ſouls. The wrath of GOD will be an ocean without ſhores, as Noah's flood was: it will be miſery that will have no end.</p>
               <p>THE miſery of the damned in hell can be better repreſented by nothing, than by a deluge of miſery, a mighty deluge of wrath, which will be ten thouſand times worſe than a deluge of waters; for it will be a deluge of liquid fire, as in the ſcriptures it is called a lake of fire and brimſtone.</p>
               <p>AT the end of the world, all the wicked ſhall liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be ſwallowed up in a vaſt deluge of fire, which ſhall be as great and as mighty, as Noah's deluge of water. See 2 Pet. iii. 5. 6. 7.—After that the wicked will have mighty billows of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone eternally rolling over their poor ſouls, and their miſerable, tormented bodies. Thoſe billows will be bigger than the mountains, or they may be called vaſt liquid mountains of fire and brimſtone. And when one billow ſhall have gone over their heads, another ſhall follow, and ſo one ſhall follow another, without intermiſſion, giving them no reſt day nor night to all eternity.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THIS flood of wrath will probably come upon
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:016767_0032_0F9E1EF6A1185210"/>
you ſuddenly, when you ſhall think little of it, and it ſhall ſeem far from you. So the flood came upon the old world; ſee Mat. xxiv. 36. &amp;c.—Probably many of them were ſurprized in the night by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters buſting ſuddenly in at their doors, or under the foundations of their houſes, coming in upon them in their beds. For when the fountains of the great deep were broken up, the waters, as was obſerved before, burſt forth in mighty torrents, as if they had iſſued out of the womb. To ſuch a ſudden ſurprize of the wicked of the old world in the night, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly that alludes in Job xxvii. 20. <q>Terrours take hold on him as waters; a tempeſt ſtealeth him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the night.</q>
               </p>
               <p>So deſtruction is wont to come on wicked men, who hear many warnings of approaching deſtruction, and yet will not be influenced by them. For he that is often reproved, and hardeneth his neck, ſhall ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly be deſtroyed and that without remedy. Prov. xxix. 1. And when they ſhall ſay, peace and ſafety; then ſudden deſtruction cometh upon them, as travel upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape. 1. Thes. v. 3.</p>
               <p n="5">5. IF you will not hearken to the many warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which are given you of approaching deſtruction, you will be guilty of more than brutiſh madneſs: You will be more brutiſh than the brutes themſelves. The ox knoweth his owner and the aſs his maſter's crib. They know upon whom they are dependent, and whom they muſt obey, and act accordingly. But you ſo long as you neglect your own ſalvation, act as if you knew not GOD, your creator and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor, nor your dependence upon him.—The very beaſts, when they ſee ſigns of an approaching ſtorm, will betake themſelves to their dens for ſhelter. Yet
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:016767_0033_0F9E1EF7641FC1C8"/>
you, when abundantly warned of the approaching ſtorm of divine vengeance will not fly to <hi>the hiding-place from the ſtorm and the covert from the tempeſt.</hi> The ſparrow, the ſwallow and other birds, when they are forewarned of approaching winter, will betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to a ſafer climate. Yet you who have been often forewarned of the piercing blaſts of divine wrath, will not, in order to eſcape them, enter into the new Jeruſalem, of moſt mild and ſalubrious air, though the gate ſtands wide open to receive you. The very ants will be diligent in ſummer to lay up for winter. Yet you will do nothing to lay up in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time to come. Balaam's aſs would not run upon a drawn ſword, though his maſter, for the ſake of gain, would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf to the ſword of GOD'S wrath; and ſo GOD made the dumb aſs, both in his words and actions, to rebuke the madneſs of the prophet. 2. Pet. ii. 16. In like manner you, although you have been often warned that the ſword of GOD'S wrath is drawn againſt you, and will certainly be thruſt through you, if you proceed in your preſent courſe, ſtill proceed regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the conſequence.</p>
               <p>SO GOD made the very beaſts and birds of the old world to rebuke the madneſs of the men of that day. For they, even all ſorts of them, fled to the ark, while the door was yet open; which the men of that day refuſed to do; GOD hereby thus ſignifying, that their folly was greater, than that of the very brute creatures.</p>
               <p>SUCH folly and madneſs are you guilty of, who refuſe to hearken to the warnings that are given you of the approaching flood of the wrath of GOD.</p>
               <p>YOU have been once more warned to day, while the door of the ark yet ſtands open. You have as it
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:016767_0034_0F9E1EF829CC7C38"/>
were once again heard the knocks of the hammer and ax in the building of the ark; to put you in mind, that a flood is approaching. Take heed, therefore that you do not ſtill ſtop your ears, treat theſe warnings with a regardleſs heart, and ſtill ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect the great work which you have to do, leſt the flood of wrath ſuddenly come upon you, ſweep you away and there be no remedy.</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>1 KINGS, xviii. 21.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>And</hi> ELIJAH <hi>came unto all the people and ſaid, How long halt ye between two opinions? If the</hi> LORD <hi>be</hi> GOD, <hi>follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people anſwered him not a word.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is the manner of GOD, before he beſtows any ſignal or remarkable mercy on a people, firſt to prepare them for it; and before he removes any aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgments which he hath brought upon them for their ſins, firſt to cauſe them to forſake thoſe ſins which procured thoſe judgments. We have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this in the chapter wherein is the text.</p>
            <p>IT was a time of ſore famine in Iſrael. There had been neither rain nor dew, for the ſpace of three years and ſix months. This famine was brought upon the land for their idolatry. But GOD was now about to remove this judgment; and therefore to prepare them for it, ſends Elijah to convince them of the folly of idolatry, and to bring them to repentance of it.—In
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:016767_0036_0F9E1EF9C644C450"/>
order to this, Elijah by the command of the LORD goes and ſhows himſelf to Ahab, and directs him to ſend and gather all Iſrael to him at mount Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, and all the prophets of Baal four hundred and fifty, and the prophets of the groves, that eat at Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebel's table, four hundred; that they might deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the matter and bring the controverſy to an iſſue, whether Jehovah or Baal were GOD.—To this end, Elijah propoſes that each ſhould take a bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, that he ſhould take one, and the prophets of Baal another, that each ſhould cut his bullock in pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, lay it on the wood, and put no fire under; and that the GOD who ſhould anſwer by fire ſhould be concluded to be GOD.</p>
            <p>THE text contains an account of what Elijah ſaid to all the people at their firſt meeting and of their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence <q>;And Elijah came unto all the people and ſaid, how long halt ye between two opinions? If the LORD be GOD, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.</q> To which the people, it ſeems, made no reply. In theſe words, we may obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. HOW Elijah expoſtulates with the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their halting ſo long between two opinions; in which expoſtulation may be obſerved,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) WHAT the two opinions were, between which they halted, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Whether the LORD were GOD, or whether Baal were GOD. The caſe in Iſrael ſeems to have been this; there were ſome who were altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for Baal and wholly rejected the true GOD; of which number, to be ſure, were Jezebel and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of Baal. And there were ſome among them, who were altogether for the GOD of Iſrael and wholly rejected Baal; as GOD told Elijah that <q>he had yet left in Iſrael ſeven thouſand, that had not bowed the knee to Baal, and whoſe mouths had not kiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him;</q> 1 Kings xix. 18.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:016767_0037_0F9E1EFDD11B70B8"/>
BUT the reſt of the people halted between two opinions. They ſaw that ſome were for one, and ſome for the other, and they did not know which to chooſe; and as is commonly the caſe, when difference of opinions prevails, there were many who had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at all; they were not ſettled in any thing; the different opinions prevalent in Iſrael diſtracted and confounded them.—Many who profeſſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the true GOD, were yet very cold and indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, and many very wavering and unſettled. They ſaw that the king and queen were for Baal; and Baal's party was the prevailing party; but their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers had been for the LORD; and they knew not which were right. Thus they halted between two opinions.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) IN this expoſtulation is implied the unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of their thus halting between two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.—<q>How long halt ye between two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? If the LORD be GOD, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him</q>—Which implies that they ought to determine one way or the other.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE may obſerve their ſilence on this occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;—"And the people anſwered him not a word" as being convicted in their own conſciences of the unreaſonableneſs of their being for ſo long a time wavering and unreſolved: they had nothing to reply in excuſe for themſelves.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE. The unreſolvedneſs of many perſons in religion is very unreaſonable.</p>
            <p>I. PROP. Many perſons remain exceedingly unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined with reſpect to the things of religion. They are very much undetermined in themſelves whether to embrace religion or to reject it.—Many who are baptized and make a profeſſion of religion, and ſeem to be chriſtians; are yet in their own minds halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:016767_0038_0F9E1EFFEFB6D800"/>
between two opinions: they never yet came ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to a concluſion, whether to be chriſtians or not. They are tought the chriſtian religion in their child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and have the bible, the word preached, and the means of grace all their days; yet continue, and grow up, and many grow old, in an unreſolvedneſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to embrace chriſtianity or not; and many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue unreſolved as long as they live.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE are ſome perſons who have never come to a ſettled determination in their own minds, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no there be any truth in religion. They hear of the things of religion from their childhood all their days; but never come to a concluſion in their own minds, whether they be real or fabulous. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, ſome have never come to any determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their own minds, whether there be any ſuch thing as <hi>converſion.</hi> They hear much talk about it, and know that many pretend to be the ſubjects of it; but they are never reſolved whether all be not mere deſigned hypocriſy and impoſture, or the mere notions of whimſical perſons.</p>
            <p>SOME never come to any determination whether the ſcriptures be the word of GOD, or whether they be the invention of men; and whether the ſtory concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing JESUS CHRIST be any thing but a fable. They fear it is true, but ſometimes very much doubt of it. Sometimes when they hear arguments for it, they give an aſſent to it, that it is true; but upon every little objection or temptation ariſing, they call it in queſtion; and are always wavering and never ſettled about it.</p>
            <p>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it ſeems to have been with many of the Jews in CHRIST'S time; they were always at a loſs what to make of him, whether he were indeed the CHRIST, or whether he were Elias, or one of the old prophets,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:016767_0039_0F9E1F0122E5D298"/>
or a mere impoſtor. Joh. x. 24. 25. <q>Then came the Jews round about him, and ſaid unto him, how long doſt thou make us to doubt? If thou be the CHRIST, tell us plainly. JESUS anſwered them, I told you, and ye believed not.</q>—Some have never ſo much as come to a reſolution in their own minds, whether there be a GOD or not. They know not that there is, and oftentimes very much doubt of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THERE are ſome who never have come to any determination in their own minds, whether to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace religion in the practice of it. Religion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts not merely, or chiefly in theory or ſpeculation, but in practice. It is a practical thing; the end of it is to guide and influence us in our practice: and conſidered in this view, there are multitudes who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have come to a concluſion whether to embrace religion or not.—It is probably pretty general for men to deſign to be religious ſometime or other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they die: For none intend to go to hell. But they ſtill keep it at a diſtance; they put it off from time to time, and never come to any concluſion which determines them in their preſent practice. And ſome never ſo much as fix upon any time. They deſign to be religious ſometime before they die, but they know not when.</p>
            <p>THERE are many who have always hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued unreſolved about the neceſſity of ſtriving and being earneſtly engaged for ſalvation. They flatter themſelves that they may obtain ſalvation, though they be not ſo earneſtly engaged; though they mind the world and their worldly affairs more than their ſalvation. They are often told how neceſſary it is that they make haſte and not delay, that they do whatever their hand findeth to do with their might,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:016767_0040_0F9E1F01F01D5E18"/>
that they be violent, that a dull, ſlack way of ſeeking ſalvation is never like to be effectual. But of theſe things they are never thoroughly convinced. Some ſeem to reſolve to be in earneſt, and ſeem to ſet out with ſome engagedneſs of mind; but ſoon fail, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have never been fully convinced of the neceſſity of it.</p>
            <p>MANY have never come to a determination what to chooſe for their portion. There are but two things which GOD offers to mankind for their portion: One is this world, with the pleaſures and profits of ſin, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with eternal miſery enſuing: The other is heaven and eternal glory, with a life of ſelf-denial and reſpect to all the commands of GOD, preceeding. Many as long as they live come to no ſettled deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, which of theſe to chooſe. They muſt have one or the other, they cannot have both. But they always remain in ſuſpence, and never make their choice.</p>
            <p>THEY would fain have heaven and this world too; they would have ſalvation and the pleaſures and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of ſin too. But conſidering heaven and the world, as GOD offers them, they will have neither. GOD offers heaven only with the ſelf denial and difficulty which are in the way to it; and they are not willing to have heaven on theſe conditions. GOD offers the world, and the pleaſures of ſin to men, not alone, but with eternal miſery in connection with them; and ſo neither are they willing to have the world. They would fain divide heaven from the holineſs and ſelf-denial which are the way to it, and from the holineſs which reigns in it, and then they would be glad to have heaven. They would fain divide ſin from hell, and then they would fully determine, forever to cleave to ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:016767_0041_0F9E1F029C14B498"/>
BUT GOD will not make ſuch a diviſion for them. They muſt have one or the other of theſe for their portion, as GOD offers; and therefore they never make any choice at all.—Indeed they do practically and in effect chooſe ſin and hell. But they do not come to any reſolution in their <hi>own minds</hi> which they will have for their portion, whether heaven and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, or the world and hell: they are always waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and halting between two opinions. Sometimes they ſeem to determine for the one and ſometimes for the other. In times wherein they meet with no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty or temptation, and can as they ſay, do their duty without hurting themſelves or much croſſing their carnal inclinations, they ſeem to chooſe heaven and holineſs. At other times wherein they meet with difficulty in the way of duty, and great temptations of worldly profits or pleaſures, are laid before them, then they chooſe the world and let heaven and holineſs alone.—There are among us vaſt multitudes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom theſe two things have been ſet hundreds of times, who have never to this day come to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination which to have.</p>
            <p>So they have never yet determined which ſhall be their maſter, whether GOD or mammon. There are but few who have undertaken the ſervice of GOD, and are come to a reſolution and preparedneſs of mind to ſerve GOD and follow CHRIST, at all times, and to whatever difficulties it may expoſe them. Yet at the ſame time neither are they determined that they will continue to ſerve ſatan: they are afraid to draw up ſuch a concluſion.—Thus many ſpend away their lives without making their choice, putting that off, though they do in the mean time practically chooſe the ſervice of ſatan. Theſe are the perſons of whom the apoſtle James ſpeaks in chap. i. 8. <q>The dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleminded man is unſtable in all his ways.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:016767_0042_0F9E1F035BA3ED80"/>
II. To continue thus undetermined and unreſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the things of religion, is very unreaſonable, and that upon the following accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE things of religion are things wherein we are to the higheſt degree intereſted. The truth or falſehood of the doctrines of religion concerns us to the higheſt degree poſſible. It is no matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to us whether there be a GOD or not; or whether the ſcriptures be the word of GOD; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther CHRIST be the ſon of GOD; or whether there be any ſuch thing as converſion. It makes infinite odds to us, whether theſe things be ſo or not. Therefore we are under the greateſt obligation in point of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to reſolve in our minds whether they be true or falſe. They who are undetermined whether there be any truth in religion, and are contented to be ſo, not inquiring nor thoroughly uſeing the means to be determined; act very unreaſonably. They remain in doubt whether there be any ſuch thing as an heaven or hell; are quiet and eaſy to continue ignorant in this matter; are not engaged in their minds to come to a determination; do not ſearch and inquire what arguments there are to prove any ſuch things; nor diligently weigh and conſider the force of them; but buſy their minds about other things of infinitely leſs importance; and act as if they thought it did not much concern them, whether there be a future and eternal ſtate.</p>
            <p>IF they think that there is not, yet it is a matter of ſo great importance, that no wiſe man would reſt, until he had ſatisfied himſelf; becauſe if there be ſuch a future ſtate as the ſcriptures tell us of, then we muſt have our part in it, either in a ſtate of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rewards, or in a ſtate of eternal puniſhment.—So it is no matter of indifference to us what we
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:016767_0043_0F9E1F042A4B9748"/>
have for our portion, whether this world with hell, or a life of holineſs and ſelf-denial with heaven. Theſe oppoſite portions relate not merely to a few days in this world, but they relate to eternity. It is infinite madneſs therefore not to come to a determination.</p>
            <p>SO it is no matter of indifference what maſter we ſerve, whether GOD or mammon; or what intereſt we will purſue, whether our temporal or eternal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt; or which we prefer, the commands of GOD or our pleaſures, our eaſe, and convenience. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it will make a vaſt odds one way or the other. We ought therefore to come to ſome determination, which we will chooſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD hath made us reaſonable creatures and capable of rationally determining for ourſelves. GOD hath made us capable of a good acquaintance with thoſe things, which do eſpecially concern our inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Doubtleſs GOD hath made man capable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the truth in matters of religion, of coming to a good determination in theſe queſtions, whether the ſcriptures be the word of GOD, whether there be a future ſtate, and the like. The reſolution of theſe queſtions, which it ſo much concerns us to determine, is not above our capacities. GOD hath not ſet theſe things beyond the extent of our faculties.</p>
            <p>SO GOD hath made us capable of making a wiſe choice for ourſelves, as to the life which we ſhall chooſe to lead. He hath given man ſo much under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as to make him capable of determining which is beſt, to lead a life of ſelf-denial and enjoy eternal happineſs, or to take our ſwing in ſinful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments and burn in hell for ever. The queſtion is of no difficult determination.—It is ſo far from being a matter too hard for our reaſon, that the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a child is ſufficient to determine this matter.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:016767_0044_0F9E1F04DADCFFB8"/>
Therefore men in remaining undetermined in theſe matters, do not act as reaſonable creatures, but make themſelves like <q>the horſe and the mule, which have no underſtanding.</q> Pſal. xxxii. 9.</p>
            <p n="3">3. GOD puts into our hands an happy opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to determine for ourſelves. What better oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity can a man deſire to conſult his own intereſt, than to have liberty to chooſe his own portion? GOD ſetteth life and death before us. Deut. xxx. 19. <q>I call heaven and earth to record this day againſt you, that I have ſet before you life and death, bleſſing and curſing; therefore chooſe life, that thou and thy ſeed after thee may live.</q> See alſo Ezek. xviii. 31. 32. And chap. xxxiii. 11. What better opportunity can we deſire for ſecuring to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the greateſt good, than to have eternal life, and unchangeable happineſs ſet before us, and offered to our choice? Therefore thoſe who neglect coming to a reſolution, act unreaſonably, becauſe they ſtand ſo much in their own light and miſs ſo glorious an opportunity.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE things among which we are to make our choice are but few in number; there are but two portions ſet before us, one of which muſt be our por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; either life or death, either bleſſing or curſing; either a life of univerſal and perſevering obedience with eternal glory, or a worldly, carnal, wicked life, with eternal miſery. If there were many terms in the offer made us, many things of nearly an equal value, one of which we muſt chooſe, to remain long in ſuſpence and undetermined would be more excuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; there would be more reaſon for long deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on before we ſhould fix. But there are but two terms, there are but two ſtates in another world, in one or the other of which we muſt be fixed to all eternity.</p>

AND there are but two ſtates in this world, a ſtate of ſin, and a ſtate of holineſs, a natural ſtate and a converted ſtate. There is but one way in which we can come to life, which renders the determination of reaſon much the eaſier. There are but two maſters to one of which we muſt be reputed the ſervants, Baal and Jehovah, GOD and mammon: There are but two competitors for the poſſeſſion of us, CHRIST and the devil.—There are but two paths, in one of which you are to travel, either in the ſtrait and narrow way which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

            <p>THIS ſhows the unreaſonableneſs of thoſe who live under light, and have the offers of the goſpel made to them, and yet remain from year to year unfixed and undetermined, halting between two opinions.</p>
            <p n="5">5. GOD hath given us all needed helps to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine us. We have all needed helps to determine our underſtandings, as to the truth of the things of religion, as whether there be a GOD, whether the ſcriptures be the word of GOD, whether there be a future ſtate, &amp;c. We are not left in the dark as to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe things, as the poor heathen are, who are under great diſadvantages to come to the knowledge of the truth, though they be not under an impoſſibility, for <hi>they may haply feel after GOD and find him;</hi> Acts xvii. 27. But we have a clear ſunſhine to guide us, we have a particular deſcription of thoſe things which are ſet before us for truth, and have great opportunity to examine them. The ſcripture lies open before us, and all the doctrines of the goſpel are particularly ſet forth, with the reaſons on which their evidence is founded. We may ſearch and try their force and ſufficiency, as we will.</p>
            <p>WE have great helps to a wiſe and rational deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:016767_0046_0F9E1F0A1FC12E50"/>
in our choice; to determine whether it be beſt for us to chooſe a life of ſin or a life of holineſs, the ſervice of GOD or the ſervice of Baal. We have very plainly ſet before us the advantages of both ſides; the loſs and gain are particularly ſtated. CHRIST hath dealt by us faithfully, and hath told us what we ſhall get, and what we ſhall loſe, by bring his followers. He hath alſo told us what we ſhall get, and what we ſhall loſe by a life of ſin. He hath not dealt by us deceitfully. He hath not pretended greater advantages in godlineſs, than there really are, nor greater diſadvantages or dangers in ſin. Joh. xiv. 2. <q>In my fathers houſe are many manſions. If it were not ſo, I would have told you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>HE hath told us plainly that we muſt take up the croſs daily and follow him; that we muſt hate father and mother, and wife and children, and brethren and ſiſters, and our own life alſo, in order to become his diſciples; and that we muſt cut off our right hands, and pluck out our right eyes, in order to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into heaven. Thus we have a fair opportunity to count the coſt on both ſides, and are directed ſo to do. Luke xiv. 28.—How unreaſonable therefore is it, for men who have all theſe helps and advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to remain in ſuſpence, and to come<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> no conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whether they will be chriſtians or heathens, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they will be for GOD or the devil; though they have lived under the preaching of the word, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers of the goſpel, for many years.</p>
            <p n="6">6. WE have no reaſon to expect to be under bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantages to determine hereafter, than we are now. We never ſhall have a clearer revelation of goſpel truth; never ſhall have the advantages and diſadvantages of both ſides more plainly ſet before us, than they are already in the word of GOD; nor are
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:016767_0047_0F9E1F0B5226F900"/>
we ever like to be under better advantages to know what will be beſt for us, and moſt for our intereſt. Thoſe therefore who delay, gain nothing by their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, but give ſatan more opportunity to darken their minds, to deceive them, and lead them aſtray in their choice Therefore their delay of coming to a reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is unreaſonable.</p>
            <p n="7">7. IF they come not to a determination in this life, GOD will determine for them, and will appoint them their portion with the wicked. If ſinners, by refuſing to chooſe either life or death, either heaven or hell, could thereby avoid both, or if in this caſe the matter would remain undetermined, till they ſhould determine it; the folly and unreaſonableneſs of delaying a determination, would not be ſo great. But that is not the caſe; if they go on halting between two opinions, GOD will determine for them, and that quickly; he will determine where their portion ſhall be, <abbr>viz.</abbr> among the unbelievers, in the lake that bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth with fire and brimſtone forever. GOD will not wait upon them always, to ſee what they will chooſe; but he will put an iſſue to the matter by his unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſentence.—Therefore it becomes all, if they are afraid to have their lot aſſigned them in hell, to come ſoon to a determination.</p>
            <p n="8">8. DELAY in this caſe is unreaſonable, becauſe thoſe who delay, know not how ſoon the opportunity of chooſing for themſelves will be paſt. This oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity will laſt no longer than life; when once life is paſt, they will no more have the offer made them; the ſentence will be paſt; the matter will be iſſued.</p>
            <p>THOSE who delay their choice in this world, will be glad to chooſe afterwards; then they will not be at all at a loſs which to chooſe; they will be able ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily to determine. The judgments of ſinners, who
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:016767_0048_0F9E1F0B9EFE2C70"/>
are departed this life, are ſoon reſolved whether there be any truth in religion or not; they can ſoon deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine which is beſt and moſt eligible, a life of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and ſelf-denial, with heaven for a reward, or a life of irreligion and ſin, with hell for a puniſhment. Now they no longer halt between two opinions; but it is too late, their opportunity is paſt; they are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy too late. They would give all the world for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother opportunity to chooſe; they would then ſoon come to a determination. But it will not be granted them.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>I. LET this put every one upon <hi>examining</hi> himſelf, whether or no he have ever yet come to a full deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in the affair of religion.</p>
               <p>FIRST, inquire whether or no you have ever yet come to a full determination with reſpect to the <hi>truth</hi> of the things of religion. Have you ever been fully convinced? Is it a queſtion, which has been anſwered and determined with you, whether there be a future ſtate; or does it yet remain a queſtion with you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſolved? Are you not yet to ſeek whether there be any future ſtate, and whether or no the ſtory about JESUS CHRIST be any more than a fable? Here I deſire you to note two things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. IF the main reaſon why you aſſent to the truth of religion be that others believe ſo, and you have been ſo inſtructed from your childhood; you are of thoſe with whom the truth of religion yet remains undetermined. Tradition and education will never fix and ſettle the mind, in a ſatisfactory and effectual belief of the truth of religion. Though men, taking religion upon truſt, may ſeem to give a full aſſent to the truth of religion, and not to call it in queſtion; yet ſuch a faith will not ſtand a ſhock; a temptation
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:016767_0049_0F9E1F0C5F2E8B40"/>
eaſily overthrows it: The reaſon of man in time of trial will not reſt on ſo poor evidence as that.</p>
               <p>THERE are multitudes who ſeem to grant the truth of religion, with whom the main foundation of their faith is the tradition of their fathers, or the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their neighbours; and it is to be feared, it is ſo with many who count themſelves good chriſtians. But as to all ſuch perſons as never have ſeen any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evidence to ſatisfy them, either of the truth or falſehood of religion, they are they that halt between two opinions—The ſame may be ſaid of thoſe who are unſtable in their <hi>diſpoſition</hi> with regard to CHRIST or the things which he taught.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IF you are fully come to a determination con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the things of religion, that they are true, they will be of weight with you above all things in the world. If you be really convinced that theſe things are true, that they are no fable, but reality, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but that you be influenced by them above all things in the world; for theſe things are ſo great, and ſo infinitely exceed all temporal things, that it cannot be otherwiſe. He that really is convinced that there is a heaven and hell, and an eternal judgment; that the ſoul as ſoon as parted from the body, appears before the judgment ſeat of GOD; and that the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and miſery of a future ſtate is as great as the ſcripture repreſents it; or that GOD is as holy, juſt and jealous, as he hath declared concerning himſelf in his word; I ſay, he that is really convinced and hath ſettled it with himſelf, that theſe things are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true; will regard them and be influenced by them above all things in the world. He will be more concerned by far how he ſhall eſcape eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and have the favour of GOD and eternal life, than how he ſhall get the world, gratify the fleſh,
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:016767_0050_0F9E1F0D1A2F9148"/>
pleaſe his neighbours, get honour, or obtain any temporal advantage whatſoever. His main inquiry will not be what ſhall I eat, and what ſhall I drink, &amp;c but he will ſeek firſt the kingdom of GOD and his righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>EXAMINE yourſelves therefore by this: Are not your hearts chiefly ſet upon the world and the things of it? Is it not more your concern, care and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to further your outward intereſt, then to ſecure an intereſt in heaven? And is not this the very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that you have never ſeen the reality of eternal things.</p>
               <p>SECONDLY, inquire, whether you have eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> yet come to a determination about religion with reſpect to the practice of it; whether you have choſen hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with the way to it, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the way of obedience and ſelf denial, before this world and the ways of ſin; whether you have determined upon it as moſt eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to devote yourſelves to the ſervice of GOD.—Here I ſhall mention three or four things, which are ſigns that men halt between two opinions in this matter.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To put off duty till hereafter.—When per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons love to keep their duty at a diſtance, engage not in it for the preſent, but chooſe to keep at a little diſtance from it; when they think of engaging in religion in better earneſt in a little time, when they ſhall ſo and ſo be under better conveniences for it, but do it not now, do not make haſte without delay; when they are very good <hi>intenders</hi> concerning what they will do to morrow, but very poor <hi>performers</hi> to day; when they ſay, as Felix, <q>go thy way for this time, when I have a convenient ſeaſon I will call for thee;</q> when theſe things are ſo it is a ſign that they halt between two opinions, and have never <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:016767_0051_0F9E1F0E26A76E78"/>
yet come to a full determination with reſpect to the practice of religion. Thoſe that have once fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined that religion is neceſſary and eligible, will not deſire to put it off, but will make it their preſent and immediate buſineſs.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IT is a ſign of the ſame thing, when perſons are ſtrict and conſcientious in ſome things, but not in all, not univerſal in their obedience; do ſome du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but live in the omiſſion of others; avoid ſome ſins, but allow themſelves in others; are conſcientious with reſpect to the duties of worſhip public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, but not in their behaviour to their neighbours; are not juſt in their dealings; nor conſcientious in paying their debts; nor do to others, as they would that they ſhould do to them; but have crooked, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe ways in their dealings among mankind.</p>
               <p>THE ſame may be ſaid when they are juſt in their dealings and t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>de with men, but are not conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in other things; indulge ſenſual appetites, drink to exceſs, or allow themſelves in wanton practices: Or are honeſt and temperate, but licentious in uſing their tongues, backbiting and reproaching their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men. 2. Tim. iii. 6. 7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IT is a ſign that you halt between two opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, if you ſometimes are wont to be conſiderably engaged in religion, but at other times neglect it; ſometimes forming a reſolution to be in good earneſt, then dropping it again; ſometimes ſeeming to be really engaged in ſeeking ſalvation, and very earneſt in religious duties; at other times wholly taken up about the things of the world, while religion is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, and religious duties are omitted.</p>
               <p>THESE things ſhow that you are yet unſettled, have never yet come to a full determination concerning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but are halting between two opinions, and
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:016767_0052_0F9E1F11A0E5B120"/>
therefore are thus unſtable in all your ways, and pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thus by fits and ſtarts in religion, Jam. i. 6. 7. 8. <q>But let him aſk in faith, nothing wavering: for he that wavereth is like a wave of the ſea, driven with the wind and toſſed. For let not that man think that he ſhall receive any thing of the LORD. A double minded man is unſtable in all his ways.</q> If your determination were fixed in religion, you would be more ſteady in your practice.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IT is a ſign that you are halting between two opinions, if it be your manner, to balk your duty, whenever any notable difficulty comes in the way, conſiderably croſs to your intereſt, or very inconſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with your eaſe or convenience, or your temporal honour. Whatever zeal you may ſeem to have, whatever concern about the things of religion, and however ſtrict you be in ordinary; you have never, if this be your manner, come to a full determination; have never fully made choice of religion and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of it, for your only portion; and at beſt have got no further than king Agrippa, who was <hi>almoſt</hi> perſuaded to be a chriſtian. Acts, xxvi. 28.—You are in the ſtate of the ſtony ground hearers, you have no root in yourſelves, and like a tree without root, are eaſily blown down by every wind.</p>
               <p>II. I ſhall conclude with an earneſt EXHORTATION to all, no longer to halt between two opinions, but immediately to come to a determination whether to be chriſtians or not. Let me inſiſt upon it, that you now make a choice, whether you will have heaven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> with a life of univerſal and perſevereing obedience for your portion; or hell, with a life ſpent in the purſuit of this world.—Conſider thoſe things which have been ſaid, ſhewing the unreaſonableneſs
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:016767_0053_0F9E1F12B0E48678"/>
of continuing in ſuch irreſolution about an affair of infinite importance to you, and as to which you have ſo ſhort an opportunity to make your choice. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider two things in addition to what hath been already ſaid.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THOSE who live under the goſpel, and thus continue undermined about religion, are more abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to GOD than the heathen. GOD had rather that men ſhould either be chriſtians, or down-right heathens. He hates thoſe perſons who continue from year to year, under the calls, and warnings, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and intreaties of GOD'S word; who yet can be brought to nothing; who will come to no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination at all; will neither be chriſtians, nor heathens. Theſe are they who are ſpoken of in Rev. iii. 15. 16. <q>I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or hot. So then becauſe thou art luke-warm, and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpew the out of my mouth.</q>—And Ezek. xx. 39. <q>As for you, O houſe of Iſrael, thus faith the LORD GOD, Go ye, ſerve ye every one his idols, and hereafter alſo, if ye will not hearken unto me: but pollute ye my holy name no more with your gifts, and with your idols.</q>—Theſe are they ſpoken of in 2 Tim. iii. 7. <q>Ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. IF you ſtill refuſe to come to a determination whether to be chriſtians or not; how juſt will it be, if GOD ſhall give you no further opportunity! If you refuſe to make any choice at all; and after all that hath been done to bring you to it, in ſetting life and death ſo often before you, in calling and warning you, if you will not come to a determination, how juſt
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:016767_0054_0F9E1F1417B13750"/>
will it be, if GOD ſhall wait no longer upon you, if he ſhall, by his unalterable ſentence, determine the caſe himſelf; if he ſhall fix your ſtate with the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and teach you the truth and eligibleneſs of religion, by ſad and fatal experience, when it will be too late for you to chooſe your portion, and the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer will be no more made you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>IN the foregoing chapters we have an account of the outpouring of the Holy Ghoſt on the apoſtles at Pentecoſt, and of the extraordinary effects of it in their ſpeaking boldly in the name of JESUS, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many ſtrange languages, and ſo being made the inſtruments of the ſudden converſion of vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes.

<pb n="60" facs="unknown:016767_0058_0F9E1F172E4598A8"/>
their eſteem on the accouut of his ſtanding in ſo near and honourable a relation to GOD the father. He is not valued at all the more for his being a divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or one that is GOD. By his having the divine nature, he is infinitely exalted above all created beings. But he is not at all exalted by it in their eſteem. They ſet nothing by his infinite majeſty: his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous brightneſs and greatneſs excite not any true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect or reverence in them.</p>
               <p>CHRIST is the holy one of GOD: he is ſo holy that the heavens are not pure in his ſight. He is poſſeſſed of all that holineſs which is the infinite beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and lovelineſs of the divine nature. But an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer ſets nothing by the holineſs of CHRIST.—CHRIST is the wiſdom of GOD and the power of GOD, as he is called 1. Cor. i. 24. But an unbeliever ſets nothing by his power and wiſdom.—The LORD JESUS CHRIST is full of grace and mercy: the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and love of GOD appear no where elſe ſo brightly and gloriouſly, as they do in the face of JESUS CHRIST. But an unbeliever ſets no value at all upon the infinite grace of CHRIST.</p>
               <p>NEITHER do unbelievers ſet any thing by thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent virtues which appeared in CHRIST'S human nature, when he was upon earth. He was holy, harmleſs, undefiled and ſeparate from ſinners; he was meek and lowly of heart; he was patient under afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and injuries; when he was reviled, he reviled not again. But unbelievers ſet nothing by theſe things in JESUS CHRIST.—They very often hear how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and glorious a perſon CHRIST is: they are told of his holineſs, and grace, and condeſcenſion, and meekneſs; and have the excellencies of CHRIST plainly ſet forth to them; yet they ſet all at nought.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THEY ſet nothing by his excellency in his work and office. They are told how glorious and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:016767_0059_0F9E1F179D11DD30"/>
a mediator he is, how ſufficient to anſwer all our neceſſities, and to ſave ſinners to the uttermoſt; but they make light of it all; yea that make nothing of it—They hear of the wonderful wiſdom of GOD in contriving ſuch a way of ſalvation by CHRIST, they have the manifold wiſdom of GOD ſet forth to them; but they ſet nothing by this wiſdom, nor do they make any account of the excellency of this way of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>THE unbeliever hears what a wonderful thing it was, that he who was in the form of GOD and eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it no robbery to be equal with GOD, ſhould take upon him the human nature, and come and live in this world in a mean and low condition; but he makes nothing of this.—He hears much of the dying love of CHRIST to ſinners, how wonderful it was that ſo glorious a perſon, who is infinitely above the angels, ſhould ſo ſet his love on ſuch worms of the duſt, ſo much below him, on ſuch ſinful creatures, who were his enemies, as to come and be made a curſe for them, and die a cruel and ignominious death in their ſtead; but he ſets nothing by all this. This dying love of CHRIST is a thing of no account with him, thoſe great things that CHRIST hath done and ſuffered, are with him light matters, things of no weight at all.</p>
               <p>UNBELIEVERS not only ſet <hi>little</hi> by the glory and excellency of CHRIST, but they ſet <hi>nothing</hi> by theſe things. Notwithſtanding all the ſhows and pretences which many natural men make of reſpect to CHRIST, by ſpeaking honourably of CHRIST in their prayers, and in their common converſation, and by coming to ſacraments and attending other ordinances of CHRIST; yet indeed they do not ſet ſo much by all the glory and excellency of CHRIST, either the glory of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or the glory of his work as a Saviour, as they do by the ſmalleſt earthly enjoyment.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:016767_0060_0F9E1F18C757E9D0"/>
I PROCEED now to mention ſome EVIDENCES of the truth of this doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THEY never give CHRIST any honor on the account of this his glory and excellency. They may and often do pay CHRIST an external and ſeeming reſpect; but they do not honor CHRIST in their hearts. They have no exalting thoughts of CHRIST, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward reſpect or reverence towards him: they have indeed no honorable, reſpectful thoughts of CHRIST. All their outward worſhip is only feigned; none of it ariſes from any real honor or reſpect in their hearts towards Chriſt. It is either only for faſhions ſake, and in compliance with cuſtom, or elſe it is forceed, and is what they are driven to by fear, as we read Pſal. lxvi. 3. <q>Through the greatneſs of thy power, ſhall thine enemies ſubmit themſelves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee.</q> In the original it is, <hi>ſhall thine enemies lie unto thee,</hi> i. e. yield a feigned obedience. Through the greatneſs of Chriſt's power, and for fear of his wrath, his enemies who have no reſpect or honour for him in their hearts, will lie to him, and make a ſhow of reſpect when they have none.</p>
               <p>AN unbeliever is not ſenſible that Chriſt is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of any glory, and therefore does not at all ſeek the glory of Chriſt in any thing that he does; he does nothing that he does in religion, out of reſpect to Chriſt's glory, but wholly for other ends; which ſhows that he ſees not Chriſt to be worthy of any glory.—Chriſt is ſet laſt and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in the heart of an unbeliever. He has high thoughts of other things; he has high thoughts of creature objects and earthly enjoyments, but mean and low thoughts of Chriſt. He has more honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thoughts of that which is but mere dirt and dung, than he has of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>THE unbeliver ſhows the mean and contemptible
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:016767_0061_0F9E1F19E615CD38"/>
thoughts that he has of CHRIST, in refuſing to accept of him, and in ſhutting the door of his heart againſt him. CHRIST ſtands at the door and knocks, and ſometimes ſtands many years knocking at the door of his heart, and he refuſes to open to him. Now it certainly ſhows that men have a very mean thought of a perſon, when they ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut him out of their doors—Unbelievers ſhow the mean and diſhonourable thoughts they have of CHRIST in that they dare not truſt him. They believe not what he ſays to be true: they will not truſt the word of CHRIST, ſo far as the word of one of their honeſt neighbours, or of a ſervant whom they have found to be faithful.—It alſo appears that they have no real honour for CHRIST in their hearts, in that they refuſe to obey his commands. They do nothing that they do, from a ſpirit of obedience to him: and that external obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence which they render, is but a forced, feigned o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, and not from any reſpect to CHRIST'S au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or worthineſs to be obeyed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THEY have no love to him on the account of his glory and excellency. If they did ſet any thing by all the glory and excellency of CHRIST, or if they ſaw any excellency or glory in CHRIST; they would have ſome meaſure of love to CHRIST. But the truth is, they ſee no form or comlineſs in CHRIST, and hence they have no love at all to CHRIST: an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer never exerciſes one act of true love to CHRIST. All that he is told of the glory of CHRIST, of his divine perfections, of his holineſs, his meekneſs and grace, has no influence at all to draw forth any love. The diſplay of theſe things doth no more draw forth love out of the heart of an unbeliever, than it draws forth love from the ſtones and rocks.</p>
               <p>A NATURAL man hath no love of benevolence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards CHRIST. Notwithſtanding all that is declared
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:016767_0062_0F9E1F1A9941B2C0"/>
to him of the excellency of CHRIST, he has no good will towards CHRIST. He rejoices not in his glory and happineſs; he would not care what became of CHRIST, if he could but eſcape hell. If CHRIST ſhould be dethroned, or made miſerable, or ſhould ceaſe to be, he has not ſo much good will to CHRIST, as would make him concerned about it. And if the kingdom and intereſt of CHRIST in the world, ſhould go to ruin, it would be no wiſe grievous to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer, provided his own intereſt could be ſecure.</p>
               <p>SO alſo an unbeliever has no love of complacency in JESUS CHRIST for his excellency. He takes no delight in the view or conſideration of any of that glory and excellency of CHRIST, of which he is told. He is told that it is exceedingly beautiful and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; but he ſees nothing entertaining in it; he takes no pleaſure in the view of any thing that he can ſee in CHRIST: the thoughts of the glory of CHRIST are no wiſe entertaining to him: he has no delight in the thoughts of it, or in any contemplations upon it.—He takes delight in thinking of theſe and thoſe earthly objects; but when he comes to turn his mind upon JESUS CHRIST, if ever he ſo does, this is to him a dry and barren ſubject: he finds nothing there to feed and delight his ſoul; no beauty or love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs to pleaſe or gratify him.</p>
               <p n="3">3. UNBELIEVERS have no deſires after the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of CHRIST. If they did ſet any thing by the glory and excellency of CHRIST, they would have ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires after him on account of that excellency: eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when he is offered to them, and is from time to time ſet forth, as the proper object of their choice and deſires. That which men prize, they are wont to deſire, eſpecially if it be repreſented to them as attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and as fit and ſuitable for them. But unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers have no deſires after the enjoyment of CHRIST. They deſire to be delivered from hell, but they deſire</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="unknown:016767_0063_0F9E1F1CDA5E36B0"/>
THEY have no idea of any happineſs to be had in the enjoyment of CHRIST: they cannot conceive what happineſs there can be in beholding CHRIST and being with him, in ſeeing his holineſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating his wonderful grace and divine glory. They have no reliſh for any ſuch thing, nor appetite after it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THEY ſhow that they ſet nothing by the glory and excellency of CHRIST, in that they ſeek not at all a conformity to that glory and excellency. A na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man may ſeek to be holy, but it is not for ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſake, it is only that he may eſcape wrath. He has no deſires after holineſs, nor is it indeed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs that he ſeeks, becauſe he is all the while an enemy to holineſs. A natural man has no deſires to have his ſoul conformed to the glorious beauty and excellency of Chriſt, nor to have his image upon him.</p>
               <p>IF he in any degree prized or delighted in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of Chriſt, he would neceſſarily deſire to be like him ſo far as he could. This we ſee in ourſelves and in all men, when we ſee any qualifications in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that are pleaſing to us and that we ſet by, it is natural for us to endeavour to imitate them and to ſeek to be in thoſe things conformed to thoſe perſons. Hence men are apt to learn of thoſe, of whom they have a great eſteem: they naturally fall into an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their ways and manner of behaviour. But natural men feel within themſelves no diſpoſition or inclination to learn of Chriſt, or to imitate him. Their tempers and diſpoſitions remain quite contrary to Chriſt's, neither do they grow at all better or more conformed to Chriſt, but wax worſe and worſe. 2 Tim. iii. 13. <q>Evil men and ſeducers ſhall wax worſe and worſe.</q>

               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>I. THIS doctrine may teach us the heinouſneſs of the ſin of unbelief, as this ſin ſets all the glory and excellency of Chriſt at nought. It often appears ſtrange to natural men, that unbelief ſhould be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of as ſuch a heinous and crying ſin. They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee ſuch evil in it. There are other ſins which often trouble natural men's conſciences, when this ſin of unbelief troubles them not at all, though it be that which brings far greater guilt upon them, than thoſe ſins about which they are more troubled.</p>
               <p>THIS that has been now ſaid may ſhow why unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief is ſpoken of as ſuch a heinous ſin, as it is, Joh. iii. 18. and chap. xvi. 9. and 1. Joh. v. 10. For there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the glory and excellency of Chriſt is ſet at nought, though it be ſo great; though it be infinite; though it be the glory of the godhead itſelf, and though it has been ſo gloriouſly manifeſted in what Chriſt has done and ſuffered. Natural men in their unbelief caſt contempt on all this glory, and tread it under foot, as being nothing worth. Their unbelief treats the excellency of Chriſt, as being of leſs value than the meaneſt earthly enjoyments.</p>
               <p>II. THIS doctrine may convict natural men in four particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. HEREBY you may be convinced of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of your guilt. Conſider how great and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent that perſon is, whom you thus ſet at nought. Contempt of any perſon is heinous in proportion to the worthineſs and dignity of the perſon contemned. Though we are but men, and worms of the duſt, and very vile, ſinful creatures; yet we take it grievouſly, when we are deſpiſed. Conſider how you yourſelves are ready to reſent it, when any of your neighbours
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:016767_0065_0F9E1F1F35FCADC0"/>
ſeem to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>light you, and ſet light by what you ſay and do, and to make no account of it, but to treat you as if you were good for nothing, or not worth mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Do you take this well of your neighbours and equals, when you obſerve any thing of this nature? are you not ready to look upon it with reſentment, to think very ill of it, and to judge that you have great cauſe to be offended?</p>
               <p>BUT if it be ſuch a crime to deſpiſe you and ſet you at nought, what is it to ſet at nought the eternal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely glorious ſon of GOD, in compariſon with whom you and all nations are nothing and leſs than nothing and vanity? You diſlike it much to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned by your equals; but you would take it yet more greivouſly to be deſpiſed by your inferiors, by thoſe whom one every account you much excel.—What a crime is it then for a vile, ſinful worm, to ſet at nought him who is the brightneſs of the glory of the king of kings!</p>
               <p>IT would be a crime inexpreſſibly heinous to ſet <hi>little</hi> by the glory and excellency of ſuch a perſon; but it is more ſo, to ſet <hi>nothing at all</hi> by it, as you do. You have no value at all for it, as has been ſhown.—And this is the more aggravated, as Chriſt is a perſon whom you ſo much need, and as he came into the world out of infinite grace to ſinners, to lay down his life to deliver them from hell, and purchaſe for them eternal glory. How much has Chriſt done and ſuffered, that you might have opportunity to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! Yet you ſet nothing by it all; you ſet nothing by the blood of Chriſt, even by that blood that was ſhed for ſuch poor ſinners as you are, and that is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to you for your ſalvation. But you trample under foot the blood of the ſon of GOD.—If Chriſt had come into the world only <hi>to teach</hi> us, it would
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:016767_0066_0F9E1F1FE22C1F88"/>
have been a heinous thing, to trample under foot his word and inſtructions. But when he came <hi>to die</hi> for us, how much more heinous is it to trample under foot his <hi>blood!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MEN take it hardly to have any of their qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or actions deſpiſed, which they eſteem commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable. But eſpecially do they highly reſent it, when others ſlight their kindneſs. And above all when they have put themſelves out of their way, and have deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and ſuffered conſiderably to do others a kindneſs; then to have their kindneſs deſpiſed, and ſet at nought, is what men would above all things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. How heinous then is it, and how exceedingly provoking to GOD muſt it be, thus to ſet at nought ſo great kindneſs and love of CHRIST, when from love to ſinners he ſuffered ſo much?</p>
               <p>CONSIDER how highly the angels who are ſo much above you, do ſet by the glory and excellency of Chriſt, by which you ſet nothing. They admire and adore the glory of Chriſt, and ceaſe not day nor night to praiſe the ſame in the moſt exalted ſtrains. Rev. v. 11. 12. <q>And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne, and the beaſts, and the elders: and the number of them was ten thouſand times ten thouſand, and thouſands of thouſands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying with a loud voice, worthy is the lamb that was ſlain, to receive power, and riches, and wiſdom, and ſtrength, and honour, and glory, and bleſſing.</q> The ſaints admire the excellency of Chriſt, and the glorious angels admire it, and every creature in heaven and earth, but only you unbelieving children of men.</p>
               <p>CONSIDER not only how much the angels ſet by the glory of Chriſt, but how much GOD himſelf ſets by it: for he is the darling of heaven, he was eternally GOD'S delight; and becauſe of his glory GOD hath
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:016767_0067_0F9E1F20A9C14908"/>
thought him worthy to be appointed the heir of all things, and hath ſeen fit to ordain that all men <hi>ſhould honour the ſon even as they honour the father.</hi>—Is he thus worthy of the infinite eſteem and love of GOD himſelf? and is he worthy of no eſteem from you?</p>
               <p n="2">2. HEREBY you may be convinced of your dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. You muſt needs think, that ſuch guilt will bring great wrath: doubtleſs GOD is dreadfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by your thus deſpiſing Jeſus Chriſt. Dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful deſtruction is denounced in ſcripture againſt thoſe that deſpiſe only the diſciples of Chriſt; Mat. xviii. 6. What deſtruction then will come on them that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe all the glorious excellency of Chriſt himſelf!</p>
               <p>CONSIDER that you not only have no value for all the glory and excellency of Chriſt; but you are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to him on that very account. The very ground of that enmity and oppoſition which there is between your hearts and Jeſus Chriſt, is the glorious perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and excellencies that there are in Jeſus Chriſt. By being ſuch an holy and excellent Saviour, he is contrary to your luſts and corruptions: If there were a Saviour offered to you that was agreeable to your corrupt nature, ſuch a Saviour you would fall in with the offer of; ſuch a Saviour you would accept. But Chriſt being a Saviour of ſuch purity, holineſs, and divine perfection, this is the cauſe why you have no inclination to him, but are offended in him.</p>
               <p>INSTEAD of being a precious ſtone in your eyes, he is a ſtone of ſtumbling and a rock of offence to you. That he is a Saviour who hath manifeſted ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine perfections in what he hath done and ſuffered, is one principal reaſon why you ſet nothing by him.—Conſider how provoking this muſt needs be to GOD the Father, who has given his only begotten ſon for your ſalvation; and what wrath it merits from the ſon whom you thus treat. And conſider how you will hereafter bear this wrath.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:016767_0068_0F9E1F215D270EF8"/>
CONSIDER that however Chriſt be ſet at nought by you, yet he ſhall be the head of the corner, and that even with reſpect to you. Though you ſet him low, yet he ſhall be exalted with reſpect to you. It is but a vain thing for you to make light of Chriſt and treat him with contempt. How much ſoever you contemn him, you cannot break his bands aſunder, nor caſt his cords from you. You will ſtill be in his hands. While you deſpiſe Chriſt, GOD will deſpiſe you, and the Lord will have you in deriſion. GOD will ſet his king on his holy hill of Zion in ſpite of all his enemies: Pſal. ii. 1—6. Though you ſay we will not have this man to reign over us, yet Chriſt will rule over you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pſal. cx. 2. <q>Rule thou in the midſt of thine enemies.</q> If you will not ſumbit to the ſceptre of his grace, you ſhall be ſubject to the rod of his wrath, and he will rule you with a rod of iron: Pſal. ii. 9, 10, 11, 12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. You may hence be led to ſee how worthleſs many of thoſe things in yourſelves are, that you have been ready to make much of. Particularly, if it be ſo that you ſet nothing by all the glory of Chriſt, then what are thoſe deſires that you have after Chriſt, good for? and that willingneſs that you think you find, to come to Chriſt?—Sinners are often wont to excuſe themſelves in their unbelief with this, that they ſee not but that they are wiling to come to Chriſt, and would gladly come to him if they could, and have great deſires to come to him. And they make much of ſuch a willingneſs and ſuch deſires, as though GOD were unjuſt to puniſh them for not coming to Chriſt, when they would gladly come to Chriſt if they could. But this doctrine ſhows that your wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs and deſires to come to Chriſt, are not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be mentioned as any excuſe: for they are not
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:016767_0069_0F9E1F221C061E38"/>
from any reſpect to Chriſt, but are merely forced<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> you at the ſame time ſet Chriſt at nought; or ſet no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by all his excellency and glory.</p>
               <p>SO you may hence learn the worthleſſneſs of all your pains and endeavours after Chriſt. When ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners have taken a great deal of pains to get an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Chriſt, they are wont to make a righteouſneſs of it; little conſidering that at the very time they are taking ſo much pains to get an intereſt in Chriſt, they ſet nothing at all by Chriſt, for any glory or excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency that there is in him; but ſet him wholly at nought, and ſeek him out of reſpect to their own intereſt.</p>
               <p n="4">4. HENCE learn how juſtly GOD might for ever refuſe to give you an intereſt in Chriſt. For why ſhould GOD give you any part or intereſt in him whom you ſet at nought, all whoſe glory and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency you value not in the leaſt, but rather trample it under your feet, and prefer the dirt before it.</p>
               <p>WHY ſhould GOD ever give you any intereſt in him whom you ſo deſpiſe? ſeeing you deſpiſe him, how juſtly might you be obliged to go without any inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in him! How juſtly might you be refuſed any part in that precious ſtone, whoſe preciouſneſs you make no account of, and eſteem no more than that of the ſtones of the ſtreet!—Is GOD obliged to caſt ſuch a pearl before ſwine who will trample it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their feet? Is GOD obliged to make you poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of his infinitely glorious and dear ſon, when at the ſame time you count him not worth the having, for the ſake of any worth or excellency that there is in him; but merely becauſe you cannot eſcape hell without him?</p>

He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares his coming at thoſe times, to the coming of GOD in two remarkable judgments that were paſt; firſt to that in the time of the flood; <q>and as it was in the days of Noe, ſo ſhall it be alſo in the days of the ſon of man.</q> Nextly he compares it to the deſtruction of Sodom and Gomorrah: <q>likewiſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, as it was in the days of Lot—even <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſhall it be in the day when the ſon of man is revealed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THEN he immediately proceeds to direct his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple how they ſhould behave themſelves at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:016767_0071_0F9E1F2610EED2D8"/>
of the ſignal of the approach of that day, referring eſpecially to the deſtruction of Jeruſalem. <q>In that day, he which ſhall be upon the houſe top, and his ſtuff in the houſe, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewiſe not return back.</q> In which words Chriſt ſhows that they ſhould make the utmoſt haſte to flee and get out of the city to the mountains, as he commands Mat. xxiv. 15. &amp;c. <q>When ye there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall ſee the abomination of deſolation ſpoken of by Daniel the prophet ſtand in the holy place, then let them which be in Judea, flee to the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; let him which is in the houſe-top, not come down to take any thing out of the houſe; neither let him which is in the field, turn back to take his clothes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>JERUSALEM was like Sodom in that it was devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſtruction, by ſpecial divine wrath, as that was; and indeed to a more terrible deſtruction than Sodom was. Therefore the like direction is given concerning fleeing out of it with the utmoſt haſte, without looking behind, as the angel gave to Lot, when he bid him flee out of Sodom; Gen. xix. 17. <q>Eſcape for thy life; look not behind thee, neither ſtay thou in all the plain.</q>—And in the text Chriſt enforces his council by the inſtance of Lot's wife. He bids them remember her and take warning by her, who looked back as ſhe was fleeing out of Sodom, and became a pillar of ſalt.</p>
            <p>IF it be inquired why Chriſt gave this direction to his people to flee out of Jeruſalem, in ſuch exceeding haſte, at the firſt notice of the ſignal of her approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtruction; I anſwer, it ſeems to be becauſe flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Jeruſalem was a type of fleeing out of a ſtate of ſin. Eſcaping out of that unbelieving city
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:016767_0072_0F9E1F2820A26E60"/>
typified an eſcape out of a ſtate of unbelief. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were directed to flee without ſtaying to take any thing out of their houſes, to ſignify with what haſte and greatneſs of concern, we ſhould flee out of a natural condition, that no reſpect to any worldly enjoyment ſhould prevent or delay us one moment, and that we ſhould flee to Jeſus Chriſt the refuge of ſouls, our ſtrong rock, and the mount of our defence, ſo as in fleeing to him, to leave and forſake heartily all earthly things.</p>
            <p>THIS ſeems to be the chief reaſon alſo, why Lot was directed to make ſuch haſte, and not to look be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind; becauſe his fleeing out of Sodom was deſigned on purpoſe to be a type of our fleeing from that ſtate of ſin and miſery in which we naturally are.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE. We ought not to look back, when we are fleeing out of Sodom.—The following reaſons may be ſufficient to ſupport this doctrine;</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT Sodom is a city full of filthineſs and abominations. It is a filthy and abominable city; it is full of thoſe impurities that are worthy to be had in the utmoſt abhorrence and deteſtation by all. The inhabitants of it are a polluted company, they are all under the power and dominion of hateful luſts. All their faculties and affections are polluted with thoſe vile diſpoſitions that are unworthy of the human nature, that greatly debaſe it, that are exceedingly hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to GOD and dreadfully incenſe his anger. Every kind of ſpiritual abomination abounds in it: in So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom there is all filthineſs that can be thought of. There is nothing ſo hateful and abominable but that there it is to be found and there it abounds.</p>
            <p>SODOM is a city full of devils and all unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: there they have their rendezvous, and there they have their dominion. There they and thoſe that are
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:016767_0073_0F9E1F29FA3A5770"/>
like unto them, do ſport and wallow themſelves in fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs; as it is ſaid of myſtical Babylon, Rev. xviii. 2. Babylon—is become the habitation of devils, and the hold of every foul ſpirit, and the cage of every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean and hateful bird.—Who would be of ſuch a ſociety? who would not flee from ſuch a city with the utmoſt haſte, and never look back upon it, and never have the leaſt inclination of returning, or hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to do there any more?</p>
            <p>SOME in Sodom may ſeem to carry a fair face and make a fair outward ſhow; but if we could look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their hearts, they are every one altogether filthy and abominable. We ought to flee from ſuch a city, with the utmoſt abhorrence of the place and ſociety, with no deſires to dwell longer there, and never to diſcover the leaſt inclination to return to it; but ſhould be deſirous to get to the greateſt poſſible diſtance from it, that we might in no wiſe be partakers in her abominations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE ought not to look back, when fleeing out of Sodom, becauſe Sodom is a city appointed to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction. The cry of the city hath reached up to heaven. The earth cannot bear ſuch a burden as her inhabitants are; ſhe will therefore diſburden herſelf of them, and ſpue them out. GOD will not ſuffer ſuch a city to ſtand; he will conſume it. GOD is an holy GOD and his nature is infinitely oppoſite to all ſuch uncleanneſs as Sodom is full of; he will therefore be a conſuming fire to it. The holineſs of GOD will not ſuffer it to ſtand, and the majeſty and juſtice of GOD require that the inhabitants of that city, who thus of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and provoke him, be deſtroyed. And GOD will ſurely deſtroy them; it is the immutable and irrever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable decree of GOD. He hath ſaid it and he will do it. The decree is gone forth, and ſo ſure as there
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:016767_0074_0F9E1F2A6D2D4EC0"/>
is a GOD, and he is almighty and able to fulfil his decrees and threatenings, ſo ſurely will he deſtroy Sodom. Gen. xix. 12, 13. <q>Whatſoever thou haſt in this city bring them out of this place; for we will deſtroy this place, becauſe the cry of them is waxen great before the face of the Lord, and the Lord hath ſent us to deſtroy it.</q> And verſe. 14. <q>Up, get ye out of this place; for the Lord will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy this city.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THIS city is an accurſed city; it is deſtined to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. Therefore as we would not be partakers of her curſe, and would not be deſtroyed, we ſhould flee out of it and not look behind us. Rev. xviii. 4. <q>Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her ſins, and that ye receive not of her plagues.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. WE ought not to look back when fleeing out of Sodom, becauſe the deſtruction to which it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, is exceedingly dreadful: it is appointed to utter deſtruction, to be wholly and entirely conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—It is appointed to ſuffer the wrath of the great GOD, which is to be poured down from GOD upon it, like a dreadful ſtorm of fire and brimſtone. This city is to be filled full of the wrath of GOD. Every one that remains in it ſhall have the fire of GOD'S wrath come down on his head and into his ſoul: he ſhall be full of fire and full of the wrath of the Almighty.—He ſhall be encompaſſed with fire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and full of fire within: his head, his heart, his bowels and all his limbs ſhall be full of fire, and not a drop of water to cool him.</p>
            <p>NOR ſhall he have any place to flee to for relief. Go where he will, there is the fire of GOD'S wrath: his deſtruction and torment will be inevitable.—He ſhall be deſtroyed without any pity. He ſhall cry aloud, but there ſhall be none to help, there ſhall be none to
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:016767_0075_0F9E1F2B39904C30"/>
regard his lamentations, or to afford relief. The decree is gone forth, and the days come when Sodom ſhall burn as an oven, and all the inhabitants thereof ſhall be as ſtubble. As it was in the literal Sodom, the whole city was full of fire: in their houſes there was no ſafety, for they were all on fire; and if they fled out into the ſtreets, they alſo were full of fire. Fire continually came down out of heaven every where.—That was a diſmal time. What a cry was there then in that city, in every part of it! But there was none to help; they had no where to go, where they could hide their heads from fire: They had none to pity or relieve them. If they fled to their friends, they could not help them.</p>
            <p>Now with what haſte ſhould we flee from a city appointed to ſuch a deſtruction! and how ſhould we flee without looking behind us! how ſhould it be our whole intent, and what we with all our minds and might are engaged about, to get at the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from a city in ſuch circumſtances! how far ſhould we be from thinking at all of returning to a city which has ſuch wrath hanging over it!</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE deſtruction to which Sodom is appointed is an univerſal deſtruction. None that ſtay in it ſhall eſcape: none will have the good fortune, to be in any by-corner, where the fire will not ſearch them out. All ſorts, old and young, great and ſmall ſhall be deſtroyed. There ſhall be no exception of any age, or any ſex, or any condition, but all ſhall periſh together. Gen. xix. 24, 25. <q>Then the Lord rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimſtone and fire from the Lord out of heaven, and he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw thoſe cities and all the plain, and all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the ground.</q> We therefore muſt not longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:016767_0076_0F9E1F2BDCEC1550"/>
or look behind us; for there is no place of ſafety in Sodom, nor in all the plain on which Sodom is built. The mountain of ſafety is before us and not behind us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE deſtruction to which Sodom is appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is an everlaſting deſtruction. This is ſaid of the literal Sodom, that it ſuffered the vengeance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fire, Jude vii. <q>Even as Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities about them, in like manner giving themſelves over to fornication, and going after ſtrange fleſh, are ſet forth for an example, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vengeance of eternal fire.</q>—That deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that Sodom and Gomorrah ſuffered, was an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal deſtruction: thoſe cities were deſtroyed and have never been built ſince, and are not capable of being rebuilt; for the land on which they ſtood, at the time of their deſtruction ſunk and has been ever ſince co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with the lake of Sodom or the dead ſea, or as it is called in ſcripture, <hi>the ſalt ſea.</hi> This ſeems to have been thus ordered on purpoſe to be a type of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal deſtruction of ungodly men. So that fire by which they were deſtroyed, is called <hi>eternal fire,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was ſo typically, it was a type of the eternal deſtruction of ungodly men; which may be in part what is intended, when it is ſaid in that text in Jude, that they were ſet forth for an example, or for a type or repreſentation of the eternal fire in which all the ungodly are to be conſumed.</p>
            <p>SODOM has in all ages ſince been covered with a lake which was firſt brought on it by fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, to be a type of the lake of fire and brimſtone in which ungodly men ſhall have their part forever and ever, as we read Rev. xx. 15. and elſewhere.</p>
            <p>WE ought not therefore to look back when flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of Sodom, ſeeing that the deſtruction to
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:016767_0077_0F9E1F2C9E74DC18"/>
which it is appointed is an eternal, deſtruction; for this renders the deſtruction truly infinitely dreadful.</p>
            <p n="6">6. SODOM is a city appointed to ſwift and ſudden deſtruction. The deſtruction is not only certain and inevitable, and infinitely dreadful, but it will come ſpeedily. <q>Their judgment lingereth not, and their damnation ſlumbereth not;</q> 2. Pet. ii. 3. And ſo Deut. xxxii. 35. <q>The day of their calamity is at hand and the things that ſhall come upon them, make haſte.</q>—The ſtorm of wrath, the black clouds of divine vengeance even now every moment hang over them, juſt ready to break forth and come down in a dreadful manner upon them. GOD hath already whet his ſword and bent his bow, and made ready his arrow on the ſtring: Pſal. vii. 12.—Therefore we ſhould make haſte and not look behind us. For if we linger and ſtop to look back, and flee not for our lives, there is great danger that we ſhall be involved in the common ruin.</p>
            <p>THE deſtruction of SODOM is not only ſwift, but will come ſuddenly and unexpectedly.—It ſeems to have been a fair morning in Sodom, on the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it was deſtroyed. There is notice taken of the time when the ſun roſe that morning: Gen. xix. 23. It ſeems that there were no clouds to be ſeen, no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of any ſtorm at all, much leſs of a ſtorm of fire and brimſtone. The inhabitants of Sodom ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no ſuch thing: even when Lot told his ſons in law of it, they would not believe it; Gen. xix. 14.—They were making merry; their hearts were at eaſe, they thought nothing of ſuch a calamity at hand. But it came at once, as travail upon a woman with child, and there was no eſcape; as it is obſerved in the context v. 28, 29. <q>They did eat, they drank; they bought, they ſold; they planted, they build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:016767_0078_0F9E1F2D68CC4A48"/>
but the ſame day that Lot went out of Sodom, it rained fire and brimſtone from heaven and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them all.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So it is with wicked men; Pſal. lxxiii. 19. <q>How are they brought into deſolation in a moment: they are utterly conſumed with terrors.</q>—If therefore we linger and look back, we may be ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly overtaken and ſeized with deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THERE is nothing in Sodom that is worth looking back upon. All the enjoyments of Sodom will ſoon periſh in the common deſtruction. All will be burnt up. And ſurely it is not worth the while to look back on things that are periſhing and conſuming in the flames, as it is with all the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſin; they are all appointed to the fire. Therefore it is fooliſh for any who are fleeing out of Sodom, to hanker any more after them; for when they are burnt up, what good can they do? And is it worth the while for us to return back for the ſake of a moment's enjoyment of them, before they are burnt, and ſo expoſe ourſelves to be burnt up with them?</p>
            <p>LOT'S wife looked back becauſe ſhe remembered the pleaſant things that ſhe left in Sodom. She hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to leave them; ſhe hankered after them; ſhe could not but look back with a wiſhful eye upon the city, where ſhe had lived in ſuch eaſe and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.—Sodom was a place of great outward plenty; they ate the fat and drank the ſweet. The <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oil where Sodom was built was exceedingly fruitful; it is ſaid to be as <hi>the garden of God,</hi> Gen. xii. 10. And <hi>fullneſs of bread</hi> was one of the ſins of the place; Ezek. xvi. 49.</p>
            <p>HERE Lot and his wife lived plentifully, and it was a place where the inhabitants wallowed in carnal pleaſures and delights. But however much it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe things, what where they worth now,
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:016767_0079_0F9E1F2E190B2200"/>
when the city was burning? Lot's wife was very fooliſh in lingering in her eſcape, for the ſake of things which were all on fire.—So the enjoyments, the profits and pleaſures of ſin, have the wrath and curſe of GOD on them: brimſtone is ſcattered on them: hell-fire is ready to kindle on them. It is not therefore worth while for any perſon to look back after ſuch things.</p>
            <p n="8">8. WE are warned by meſſengers ſent to us from GOD to make haſte in our flight from Sodom, and not to look behind us. GOD ſends to us his miniſters, the angels of the churches, on this grand errand, as he ſent the angels to warn Lot and his wife to flee for their lives, and to ſay and do as we have account in Gen. xix. 15, 16.—If we delay or look back, now that we have had ſuch fair warning, we ſhall be exceedingly inexcuſable and monſtrouſly fooliſh.</p>

               <p>THE uſe that I would make of this doctrine is to <hi>warn</hi> thoſe who are in a natural condition to flee out of it, and by no means to look back. While you are out of Chriſt, you are in Sodom. The whole hiſtory of the deſtruction of Sodom with all its cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſeems to be inſerted in the ſcriptures for our warning and is ſet forth for an example, as the apoſtle Jude ſays.

The pſalmiſt when ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the appointed puniſhment of ungodly men ſeems evidently to refer to the deſtruction of Sodom in Pſal. xi. 6. <q>Upon the wicked GOD ſhall rain ſnares, fire and brimſtone, and an horrible tempeſt; this ſhall be the portion of their cup.</q>
               </p>

                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:016767_0080_0F9E1F3198CF3DF8"/>
CONSIDER therefore what the ſtate is, that you are to get out of, you that are ſeeking an intereſt in Chriſt: you are to flee out of Sodom. Sodom is the place of your nativity, and the place where you have ſpent your lives hitherto. You are citizens of that city, which is full of filthineſs and abomination before GOD, that polluted and accurſed city. You belong to that impure ſociety. You not only live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, but you are of them, you are ſome that have committed thoſe abominations, and have ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked GOD as you have heard. It is you that I have all this while been ſpeaking of under this doctrine; you are the inhabitants of Sodom. Perhaps you may look on your circumſtances, as not very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; but you dwell in Sodom.—Though you may be reformed and appear with a clean outſide and a ſmooth face to the world; yet as long as you are in a natural condition, you are impure inhabitants of Sodom.</p>
               <p>THE world of mankind is divided into two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, or as I may ſay, into two cities: there is the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Zion, the church of GOD, the holy and beloved city; and there is Sodom that polluted and accurſed city, which is appointed to deſtruction. You belong to the latter of theſe. How much ſoever you may look upon yourſelves better than ſome others, yet you are of the ſame city; the ſame company, with fornicators, and drunkards, and adulterers, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſwearers, and high-way-men, and pirates, and So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domites. How much ſoever you may think your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves diſtinguiſhed, as long as you are out of Chriſt, you belong to the very ſame ſociety; you are of the company, you join with them, and are no better than they, any otherwiſe than as you have greater reſtraints. You are conſidered in the ſight of GOD, as fit to be ranked with them. You and they are altogether the objects of the loathing and abhorrence of GOD, and
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:016767_0081_0F9E1F3318999F68"/>
have the wrath of GOD abiding on you; you will go with them and be deſtroyed with them, if you do not eſcape from your preſent ſtate. Yea you are of the ſame ſociety and the ſame company with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, for Sodom is not only the city of wicked men, but it is the hold of every foul ſpirit.</p>
               <p>YOU belong to that city that is appointed to an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, inevitable, univerſal, ſwift and ſudden deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a city that has a ſtorm of fire and wrath hanging over it. Many of you are convinced of the awful ſtate you are in, while in Sodom, and are making ſome attempts to eſcape from the wrath which hangs over it. Let ſuch be warned by what hath been ſaid to eſcape for their lives and not to look back. Look not back unleſs you chooſe to have a ſhare in the burning tempeſt that is coming down on that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.—Look not back in remembrance of the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which you have had in Sodom, as hankering after the pleaſant things which you have had there, after the eaſe, the ſecurity, and the pleaſure which you have there enjoyed.</p>

            <p>DOCTRINE. WE ought not to look back, when we are fleeing out of Sodom.</p>
            <p>HAVING confirmed this doctrine by ſeveral rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, we come to the application of it in an uſe of warning to ſinners in a natural ſtate, and eſpecially to thoſe who are awakened and convinced of the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate in which they are, and are deſirous of eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wrath which is to come. And further to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force this warning, let me entreat all you who are in this ſtate, to conſider theſe ſeveral things which I ſhall now mention;</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE deſtruction of which you are in danger is infinitely more dreadful than that deſtruction of the literal Sodom from which Lot fled. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Sodom and Gomorrah in a ſtorm of fire and brimſtone, was but a ſhadow of the deſtruction of ungodly men in hell, and is no more to it than a ſhadow or a picture is to a reality, or than painted fire is to real fire. The miſery of hell is ſet forth by va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious

ſhadows and images in ſcripture, as blackneſs of darkneſs, a never dying worm, a furnance of fire, a lake of fire and brimſtone, the torments of the valley of the ſon of Hinnom, a ſtorm of fire and brimſtone. The reaſon why ſo many ſimilitudes are made uſe of, is becauſe none of them are ſufficient. Any one does but partly and very imperfectly repreſent the truth, and therefore GOD makes uſe of many.</p>
            <p>YOU have therefore much more need to make haſte in your eſcape, and not to look behind you, than Lot and his wife had when they fled out of Sodom; for you are every day and every moment in danger of a thouſand times more dreadful ſtorm coming on your heads, than that which came on Sodom, when the Lord rained brimſtone and fire from the Lord out of heaven upon them; ſo that it will be vaſtly more ſottiſh in you to look back, than it was in Lot's wife.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE deſtruction you are in danger of, is not only greater than the temporal deſtruction of Sodom, but greater than the eternal deſtruction of the inhabitants of Sodom. For however well you may think you have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved yourſelves, you who have continued impenitent under the glorious goſpel, have ſinned more and provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed GOD far more, and have greater guilt upon you, than the inhabitants of Sodom; although you may ſeem to yourſelves, and perhaps to others, to be very harmleſs creatures. Mat. x. 15. Verily I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable for Sodom and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah in the day of judgment, than for that city.</p>
            <p n="3">3. MULTITUDES while they have been looking back, have been ſuddenly overtaken and ſeized by the ſtorm of wrath. The wrath of GOD hath not delayed, while they have delayed; it has not waited at all for them to repent, to turn about and flee; but has preſently ſeized them, and they have been paſt
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:016767_0084_0F9E1F359E597860"/>
hope.—When Lot's wife looked back ſhe was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately deſtroyed, GOD had exerciſed patience to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks her before. When ſhe lingered at the ſetting out, the angels preſſed her, her huſband and children, to make haſte. Not only ſo, but when they yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed, they laid hold on her hands, and brought her forth and ſet her without the city, the Lord being merciful to her. But now when notwithſtanding this mercy and the warnings which had been given her, ſhe looked back, GOD exerciſed no more pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence towards her, but proceeded in wrath immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to put her to death.</p>
            <p>NOW GOD has in like manner been merciful to you. You in time paſt have been lingering; you have been warned by the angel of your danger and preſſed to make haſte and flee; yet you have delayed. And now at length God hath as it were laid hold on you, by the convictions of his ſpirit, to draw you out of Sodom; Therefore <hi>remember Lot's wife.</hi> If now af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all you ſhould look back, when GOD hath been ſo merciful to you; you will have reaſon to fear, that GOD will ſuddenly deſtroy you and wait no longer on you. Multitudes when they have been looking back and putting off to another opportunity, they have never had another opportunity; they have been ſuddenly deſtroyed and that without remedy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IF you look back and live long after it, there will be great danger that you will never get any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The only way to ſeek ſalvation is to preſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with all your might, and ſtill to look and preſs forward, never to ſtand ſtill or ſlacken your pace.—When Lot's wife ſtopped in her flight, and ſtood ſtill in order that ſhe might look, her puniſhment was that there ſhe was to ſtand forever, ſhe never got any farther; ſhe never got beyond that place; but
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:016767_0085_0F9E1F365E071A70"/>
there ſhe ſtood as a pillar of ſalt, a durable pillar and monument of wrath, for her folly and wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>SO it very often is with backſliders, though they may live a conſiderable time after. When they look back, after they have been taking pains for their ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, they loſe all, they put themſelves under vaſt diſadvantages; by quenching the ſpirit of GOD, and loſing their convictions, they dreadfully harden their own hearts and ſtupify their ſouls, make way for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, dreadfully ſtrengthen and eſtabliſh the intereſt of ſin in their hearts, many ways give ſatan great advantages to ruin them, and provoke GOD of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes utterly to leave them to hardneſs of heart. When they come to look back, their ſouls preſently become dead and hard like Lot's wife's body: and if this be the caſe, though they live long after, they never get any further; it is worſe for them, than if they were immediately damned. When perſons in fleeing out of Sodom look back, their laſt caſe is far worſe than the firſt; Mat. xii. 43, 44, 45.—And experience confirms that none ordinarily are ſo hard to be brought to repentance as backſliders.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It may well ſtir you up to flee for your lives, and not to look behind you, when you conſider, how many have lately fled to the mountain, while you yet remain in Sodom. To what multitudes hath GOD given the wiſdom to flee to CHRIST the mountain of ſafety! They have fled to the little city Zoar, which GOD will ſpare and never deſtroy. How many have you ſeen of all ſorts reſorting out of Sodom thither, as believing the word of GOD by the angels, that God would ſurely deſtroy that place. They are in a ſafe condition; they are got out of the reach of the ſtorm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fire and brimſtone can do them no hurt there.</p>
            <p>BUT you yet remain in that curſed city among the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:016767_0086_0F9E1F37255A9B58"/>
accurſed company. You are yet in Sodom, which GOD is about ſo terribly to deſtroy, where you are in danger every minute of having ſnares, fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone come down on your head.—Though ſo many have obtained, yet you have not obtained deliverance. Good has come, but you have ſeen none of it. Others are happy, but no one knows what will become of you: you have no part nor lot in that glorious ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of ſouls, which has lately been among us.—The conſideration of this ſhould ſtir you up effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to eſcape, and in your eſcape to preſs forward, ſtill to preſs forward, and to reſolve to preſs forward for ever, let what will be in the way, to hearken to no temptation, and never to look back, or in any wiſe ſlacken or abate your endeavours as long as you live, but if poſſible to increaſe in them more and more</p>
            <p n="6">6. BACKSLIDING after ſuch a time as this,<note n="*" place="bottom">The time of the revival of religion at Northampton, A. D. 1735.</note> will have a vaſtly greater tendency to ſeal a man's damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, than at another time. The greater means men have, the louder calls and the greater advantages they are under, the more dangerous is backſliding, the more it has a tendency to enhance guilt, to provoke GOD and to harden the heart.</p>
            <p>WE in this land of light, have long enjoyed grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter advantages, than the moſt of the world. But the advantages which perſons are under now for their, ſalvation, are perhaps tenfold to what they have been at ſuch times as we have ordinarily lived in; and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding will be proportionably the greater ſin, and the more dangerous to the ſoul.—You have ſeen GOD'S glory and his wonders amongſt us, in a moſt marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous manner of late.

as GOD ſware concerning them that were for going back into Egypt, after they had ſeen the wonders which GOD wrought for Iſrael. Num. xiv. 22, 23, <q>Becauſe all th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7. WE know not but that great part of the wicked world, are at this day, in Sodom's circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, when Lot fled out of it; having ſome out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, temporal deſtruction hanging over it. It looks as if ſome great thing were coming; the ſtate of things in the world ſeems to be ripe for ſome great revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The world has got to ſuch a terrible degree of wickedneſs, that it is probable that the cry of it has by this time reached up to heaven; and it is hardly probable that GOD will ſuffer things to go on, as they now do, much longer. It is likely that GOD will ere long appear in awful majeſty to vindicate his own cauſe; and then none will be ſafe that are out of CHRIST. Now therefore every one ſhould flee for his life, and eſcape to the mountain, left he be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed.—We cannot certainly tell what GOD is about to do, but this we may know, that thoſe who are out of CHRIST, are in a moſt unſafe ſtate.</p>
            <p n="8">8. TO enforce this warning againſt looking back, let me beſeech you to conſider the exceeding prone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which there is in the heart to it. The heart of man is a backſliding heart. There is in the heart a
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:016767_0088_0F9E1F38E316B250"/>
great love and hankering deſire after the eaſe, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and enjoyments of Sodom, as there was in Lot's wife, by which perſons are continually liable to temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations to look back. The heart is ſo much towards Sodom, that it is a difficult thing to keep the eye from turning that way, and the feet from tending thither. When men under convictions are put upon fleeing, it is a mere force, it is becauſe GOD lays hold on their hands, as he did on Lot's and his wife's, and drags them ſo far. But the tendency of the heart is to go back to Sodom again.</p>
            <p>PERSONS are very prone to back-ſliding, alſo thro' diſcouragement. They are apt to be diſcouraged. The heart is unſteady, ſoon tired, ſoon gives out, is apt to liſten to diſcouraging temptations. A lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle difficulty and delay ſoon overcome it's feeble re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions. And diſcouragement tends to backſlid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: it weakens perſons hands, lies as a dead weight on their hearts, and makes them drag heavily; and if it continue long, it very often iſſues in ſecurity and ſenſeleſsneſs. Convictions are often ſhaken off that way: they begin firſt to go off with diſcouragement.</p>
            <p>BACKSLIDING is a diſeaſe that is exceeding ſecret in its way of working. It is a flattering diſtemper; it works like a conſumption, wherein perſons often flatter themſelves that they are not worſe, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, and in a hopeful way to recover, till a few days before they die. So backſliding commonly comes on gradually and ſteals on men inſenſibly, and they ſtill flatter themſelves that they are not back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlidden. They plead that they are ſeeking yet, and they hope they have not loſt their convictions. And by the time they find it out, and cannot pretend ſo any longer, they are commonly ſo far gone, that they care not much if they have loſt their convictions.
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:016767_0089_0F9E1F398FAC67C8"/>
And when it is come to that, it is commonly a gone caſe with perſons as to thoſe convictions.</p>
            <p>THUS they blind themſelves, and keep themſelves inſenſible of their own diſeaſe, and ſo are not terrified with it, nor awakened to uſe means for relief, till it is paſt cure.</p>
            <p>THUS it is that backſliding commonly comes upon perſons, that have for ſome time, been under any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable convictions, and afterwards loſe them. Let the conſideration of this your danger excite you to the greateſt care and diligence to keep your hearts, and to watchfulneſs and conſtant prayer againſt back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſliding.—And let it put you upon endeavours to ſtrengthen your reſolutions of perſevering and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt every thing that tends to the contrary, that you may indeed hold out to the end, for <hi>then ſhall you know, if you follow on to know the Lord.</hi>

            <p>WE here have an account how the rich man in hell, after he had in vain begged of Abraham to ſend Lazarus to his own relief, and ſaw that there was no relief for him; prays that Lazarus may be ſent to his brethren, to warn them, that they might take care for their ſalvation, and eſcape that place of torment.—By the way, it may be proper to remark, that we cannot from this conclude, that the damned will have any workings of natural affection to their near relations in this world, or any concern for their ſalvation. The deſign of CHRIST was only parabolically to repreſent what different thoughts worldly and wicked men will have of things, when
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:016767_0091_0F9E1F3DAB69BD30"/>
they ſhall be in hell, from what they have while up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth. The rich man, when he was upon earth, only minded his honour, eaſe and pleaſure, and did not think it worth while to take care of his ſoul, and to be at much pains to eſcape hell. But now he is of another mind, and is ſenſible that if his five brethren, who live in the ſame careleſs neglect of their ſouls as he did knew what hell is, they would take more care.</p>
            <p>BUT this ſeems to be put into the parable chiefly to introduce what follows, the reply which Abraham made to him, <hi>They have Moſes and the prophets, let them hear them.</hi> As much as to ſay, They have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready abundant warning and inſtruction, which GOD himſelf hath provided for them, let them make uſe of that.</p>
            <p>THE rich man replies, <hi>Nay, father Abraham, but if <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>he went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</hi> Then come in the words of the text, And he ſaid unto him, <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the prophets, neither will they be perſuaded, though one roſe from the dead.</hi> By Moſes and the prophets is meant the whole old teſtament, which was the whole canon of ſcripture, which they had in thoſe times. The hearing of them implies at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to what they ſay, believing them, and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>They would not be perſuaded,</hi> that is, they would not be perſuaded to take thorough care of their ſouls, to forſake their ſins and turn to GOD, ſo as to avoid this place of torments. <hi>Though one roſe from the dead;</hi> though one ſhould go from the inviſible world, either from heaven, where they ſee the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the damned, or from hell, where they feel them.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE. THE warnings of GOD'S word are more fitted to obtain the ends of awakening ſinners, and bringing them to repentance, than the riſing of one from the dead to warn them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="unknown:016767_0092_0F9E1F3ECE1364C0"/>
IN this paſſage Moſes and the prophets ſeem not only to be equalized to the warnings of one from the inviſible world; but to be preferred before them. They have Moſes and the prophets let them hear them: they have already thoſe means, which GOD in his infinite wiſdom hath ſeen to be fitteſt for them, and more ſuitable to their nature and circumſtances, than the riſing of one from the dead.—But whether there can be any more than an equality neceſſarily inferred, or not; yet if only the warnings of the old teſtament have an equal tendency to bring men to repentance, as the riſing of one from the dead; then ſurely theſe together with the much clearer revalation under the goſpel diſpenſation by CHRIST and his apoſtles, wherein we are abundantly more plainly told of another world, and wherein life and immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity are brought to light; muſt have a much greater tendency and fitneſs to obtain theſe ends.</p>
            <p>SINNERS are apt to find fault with the means of grace which they enjoy, and to ſay with themſelves, If I had ever ſeen hell, or had ever heard the cries of the damned, or had ever ſeen a perſon who had felt hell-torments, or had ſeen them at a diſtance; that would awaken me; then I would forſake all my ſins, and would do whatever I could to eſcape hell. But now I am only told of hell in the bible and by miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and there never was any in this world that ſaw or felt it. So that I am ready to think it is mere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion and fancy. How do I know that there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> hell? How do I know, but that when I die, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> will be an end of me?</p>
            <p>BUT it is the indiſpoſition of ſinners to this great work, to which they are directed, which makes them find fault with their means and advantages. The ſlothful and negligent, who hate to beſtir themſelves,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:016767_0093_0F9E1F3F60513950"/>
will be objecting. <q>The way of the ſlothful is as an hedge of thorns.</q>—Sinners know not what they would have. They are fixedly averſe to breaking off their ſins by righteouſneſs; and to make the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the more excuſable, they object againſt the ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of their means, and ſo they will not believe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they ſee hell, or ſee ſome perſon, who has ſeen it.</p>
            <p>BUT GOD who knows our nature and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, knows what is moſt adapted to them. He who made the faculties of our ſouls, knows what will have the greateſt tendency to move them and to work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. He who is ſtriving with us, to bring us to repentance and ſalvation, uſes the fitteſt and beſt means. In contriving and appointing the means of our ſalvation, he chooſes better for us than we ſhould for ourſelves.</p>
            <p>IF a perſon ſhould riſe from the dead to warn ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, coming from heaven, where they ſee the miſery of the damned, or from hell, where they feel it; and ſhould tell ſinners how diſmal thoſe torments are, ſhould ſet them out as well as he would be under ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to do, having ſeen or felt them, and ſhould confirm what he ſaid by telling that he had ſeen the ſmoke of their torments, had ſeen the raging of the flames, had ſeen the dreadful crew of devils and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſouls together, and had heard their diſmal cries and ſhreiks; or ſhould ſay that he had felt them, and ſhould expreſs by words and actions the doleful ſtate of the damned and the extremity of their torments; ſuch a thing as this would probably greatly fright and terrify many ſinners, who were not terrified by reading the bible, nor by hearing preaching about hell torments. But it would be very much becauſe of the unuſualneſs and ſtrangeneſs of the thing. Men are apt to be much affected with ſtrange things, and
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:016767_0094_0F9E1F4021C23A28"/>
to be much affrighted by ſpectres in the dark, becauſe they are unuſual. But if they were as common as preaching is, they would loſe their effect.</p>
            <p>IT might be that on ſuch an unuſual occaſion, as the riſing of one from the dead, for a while men would reform their lives, and poſſibly ſome might be ſo affected, as never to forget it. But we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, which would have the greateſt tendency to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken us, if both were alike new and unuſual, to be warned of the miſery of hell by the great GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, declaring as it were from heaven, how dreadful hell is, and abundantly warning us about it; or to be warned only by a man coming from the inviſible world, who had either ſeen or felt theſe miſeries. It is in this view that we ſhall conſider the matter; and we ſhall ſhow what advantages the former mode of warning has above the latter: or how the warnings of GOD'S word have a greater tendency to awaken ſinners and bring them to repentance, than the riſing of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

hell-torments were, by his own knowledge, and could deſcribe them to others, as having ſeen and felt them.</p>
            <p>BUT ſurely the all ſeeing GOD knows as well as any of the dead, what the preſent ſufferings of the damned are. He is every where preſent with his all ſeeing eye. He is in heaven and in-hell, and in and through every part of the creation. He is where every devil is, and where every damned ſould is; he is preſent by his knowledge and his eſſence. He not only knows as well as thoſe in heaven, who ſee at a diſtance; but he knows as perfectly as thoſe who feel the miſery. He ſeeth into the innermoſt receſſes of the hearts of thoſe miſerable ſpirits. He ſeeth all the ſorrow and anguiſh that are there, for he upholds them in being. They and all the powers of their ſpirits, whereby they are capable of either happineſs or miſery, are in his hands.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, it is his wrath that they endure: he mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures out to them their ſeveral portions of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he makes his wrath enter into them; he is a conſuming fire to them; his anger is that fire, in which they are tormented. He therefore is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs able to give us as clear and diſtinct, and as true an account of hell, as the damned themſelves, if they ſhould riſe from the dead.

GOD'S teſtimony, than we could have it from the teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of one riſing from the dead. If there ſhould one riſe from the dead and ſhould tell us of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of hell torments; how precarious a foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would that be to build upon, in a matter of ſuch importance, unleſs we conſider it as confirmed by divine teſtimony. We ſhould be uncertain, whether there were not ſome deluſion in the caſe. We know that it is impoſſible for GOD to lie; and we may know that the matter is juſt as he declares it to us. But if one ſhould come from the dead, we could not be ſo ſure, that we were no way impoſed upon. We could not be ſo ſure that he who teſtified was not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſubject to ſome deluſion. We could not be ſure that the matter was not ſtrained too high, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented greater than it really is.</p>
            <p>ONE coming from the dead could not, merely, by force of his own teſtimony, make us ſure that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> ſhould come to that place of torments, if we did not repent and reform. And if there ſhould come more witneſſes than one from the dead; if there ſhould be ever ſo many; yet there is no authority equal to that of GOD; there is no teſtimony of ſpirits from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible world, which would be ſo-indiſputable and unqueſtionable, as the divine teſtimony. How could we know, unleſs by ſome divine revelation, that they who ſhould come from the dead, had not come to deceive us?

<pb n="100" facs="unknown:016767_0097_0F9E17820618E1F0"/>
the advantage, by reaſon of the greatneſs and majeſty of him, who ſpeaks. The ſpeeches and declarations of thoſe, who are great, excellent and honourable, have a greater tendency to move the affections, than the declarations of others, who are leſs excellent. Things ſpoken by a king affect more than the ſame things ſpoken by a mean man.</p>
            <p>BUT GOD is infinitely greater than kings; he is univerſal king of heaven and earth, the abſolute ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of all things. Now what can have a greater tendency to ſtrike the mind and move the heart, than to be warned by this great and glorious being? ſhall we be unmoved when he ſpeaks, who made heaven and earth by the word of his power; he who keeps the ſun, moon and ſtars in their courſes? If his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſpeeches, declarations and warnings will not influence us, what will? Iſai. i. 2, <q>Hear, O hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, and give ear, O earth, for the LORD hath ſpoken.</q>—That is to the preſent purpoſe which we have in Mat. xxi. 37. <q>But laſt of all he ſent his ſon, ſaying, They will reverence my ſon.</q> He ſent his ſervants before, but they did not regard them. He therefore ſent his ſon, who was a much greater and more honourable meſſenger, and ſaid ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they will regard him.</p>
            <p>WHAT if GOD ſhould ſend meſſengers from the dead to warn us, and many in ſucceſſion, and men ſhould reject them; we ſhould juſtly argue that it would have a much greater tendency to make men regard and obey the counſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> if he would ſend his ſon or come himſelf. But GOD hath ſent his ſon, and therein he hath come himſelf. He came down from heaven and took upon him our nature, and dwelt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us teaching and warning us concerning hell and damnation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="unknown:016767_0098_0F9E175DED3F38B0"/>
IN the bible we not only have thoſe warnings, which were given by inſpiration of the prophets; but we have GOD'S own words, which he ſpake as it were by his own mouth. In the old teſtament is his voice out of the midſt of the fire and the darkneſs, from mount Sinai. And in the new teſtament we have GOD ſpeaking to us, as dwelling among us. He came down from heaven and inſtructed us in a familiar manner, for a long while; and we have his inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons recorded in our bibles.—Now which has the greateſt tendency to influence men, to have one of the departed ſpirits ſent back into its body, to warn them; or to have GOD himſelf aſſume a body, and come and warn them?</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT more evidently ſhows the importance of the affair, that GOD ſhould immediately concern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it, than the coming of one from the dead would do. Thoſe things about which kings moſt immediately concern themſelves, are commonly mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the greateſt importance, while they leave leſs concernments to be managed by their officers. And ſurely th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> muſt be a matter of very great moment, in which GOD ſhows himſelf ſo much concerned, as he does in our ſalvation. GOD in all ages of the world hath ſhowed himſelf very much concerned in this matter. How abundantly hath he warned us in his holy word? How earneſt hath he ſhown himſelf in it? How many arguments and expoſtulations hath he uſed, that we might avoid the way to hell?</p>
            <p>THIS evidently argues that what we are warned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout is a matter of the utmoſt concern, and proves it much more than it we were only warned by one riſing from the dead.</p>
            <p n="5">5. GOD'S warning of us of our danger of damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath a greater tendency to have influence upon
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:016767_0099_0F9E1765D0EDF430"/>
us, becauſe he is our judge. Damnation is a puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to which he condemns and which he inflicts. What he warns us of is his own wrath and vengeance. In his word we have his threatenings againſt ſin de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced by himſelf. He tells us that if we go on in ſin, he will deſtroy us, and caſt us out of his ſight, and pour out his wrath upon us, and hold us eternally under torment and miſery. He tells us ſo <hi>himſelf,</hi> and this hath a much greater tendency to influence us, than to be told ſo by another, who is not to be our judge, who hath not in his hands the power of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us miſerable.</p>
            <p>WHEN a king immediately threatens his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, it has a greater tendency to terrify men, than when another man threatens it, or warns them of the danger of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. GOD is infinitely wiſe and knows better how to ſpeak to us ſo as to perſuade us, than one riſing from the dead. He perfectly knows our nature and ſtate, and knows how to adapt his inſtructions and warnings to our frame and circumſtances in the world; and without doubt that method which GOD hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and taken in his word, is agreeable to his infinite, wiſdom and moſt adapted to our nature.</p>
            <p>IF one ſhould come from hell to warn ſinners, it may be he would tell them of hell in ſuch a manner, as would have more of a tendency to drive men into deſpair, and ſet them a blaſpheming as they do in hell, than to excite them to ſtrive for ſalvation, and diligently to uſe the means which GOD hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But GOD knoweth what revelation of hell we can bear, and what hath the moſt tendency to do us good, in this our infirm, dark and ſinful ſtate.—The declarations of one come from hell might more tend to drive us from GOD, than to bring us near to
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:016767_0100_0F9E176730E72E28"/>
him. It is beſt for us to be warned and inſtructed by GOD, who knows beſt how to do it.</p>
            <p>THESE are ſome of the reaſons why the warnings of GOD'S word have more of a tendency to bring us to repentance, than the warning of one riſing from the dead.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p>I. IT is a natural inference from this doctrine, that if theſe means which GOD hath appointed, do not anſwer to lead men to repentance and reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, no others would.—Although this be not an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary conſequence from the words of the doctrine; yet it ſeems to be CHRIST'S aim to teach us that if GOD'S means will not anſwer, none will. Our own means, thoſe which we can deviſe of our own heads, However they may ſeem more likely at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to be effectual; yet if they be brought to the trial, will not prove to be better. The rich man thought that if his brethren were warned by one ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the dead, they would ſurely repent. But Abraham tells him, he is miſtaken.</p>
               <p>IF one riſing from the dead would not anſwer the purpoſe, we may rationly conclude that no other kind of means, different from thoſe appointed by GOD, would. For what can we think of, which ſeems, to have more of a tendency to awaken men, and lead to repentance, than one coming from the dead to them; except thoſe means which we enjoy.—Indeed men can think of many means, which they may imagine, if they enjoyed them, would make them believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. But they deceive themſelves.</p>
               <p>IT may be they think, if they could ſee ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and ſee him work miracales, that this would
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:016767_0101_0F9E1767B186C5A0"/>
awaken them. But how was it in thoſe times in which there were prophets? There has rarely been a more degenerate time, than that in which lived Elijah and Eliſha, thoſe great prophets of Iſrael, who wrought ſo many miracles. The people did not regard their prophecies nor their miracles; but walked in their own ways, and ſerved their own gods, ſo that Elijah thought, that there was none left of the true worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers of GOD. And how did they treat the prophet Jeremiah, ſo ſolemnly warning them from GOD of their approaching deſtruction! And how often do the prophets complain that all their prophecies and warnings were neglected and deſpiſed!</p>
               <p>WOULD it be ſufficient, if you could hear GOD ſpeak from heaven, with your bodily ears? How was it, when there were ſuch things? How was it in Moſes's time, when they heard GOD ſpeak out of the midſt of the fire, and heard the voice of words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding loud and full of majeſty, ſo that they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly trembled? When they ſaw mount Sinai all covered with ſmoke, and ſhaking exceedingly? And when ſome of them ſaw GOD, ſaw the GOD of Iſrael and did eat and drink?—How did they be have themſelves? Did they all of them turn from their ſins, and after that walk in the ways of GOD?—It is true, they were very much affected at firſt, while it was a new and ſtrange thing to them; but how hard-hearted and rebellious were they ſoon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? They did not ſcruple to rebel againſt this ſame great and glorious GOD. Yea they made a golden calf, while Moſes was in the mount converſing with GOD, juſt after they had ſeen thoſe dreadful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of divine majeſty.</p>
               <p>THUS they did from time to time rebel againſt the LORD, although they had ſeen ſo many miracles and
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:016767_0102_0F9E17686CB7FF80"/>
wonders in Egypt, at the red ſea, and in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; although they continually ſaw the pillar of cloud and of fire going before them, were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally fed in a miraculous manner with manna; and in the ſame miraculous manner made to drink water out of the rock.</p>
               <p>MEN are apt to think, that if they had lived in CHRIST'S time, and had ſeen and heard him, and had ſeen his miracles; that they would have effectually convinced and turned them from ſin. But how was it in thoſe times? How few were there brought to repentance, by all his diſcourſes and miracles? How hard-hearted were they? Some were very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected for a little while; but how few conſtant, ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy followers had he! He was notwithſtanding his miracles, rejected, deſpiſed and even murdered by the people, among whom he dwelt. And they were men of the ſame natures, of the ſame ſort of hearts, as ſinners in theſe days.</p>
               <p>The ſcripture is full of inſtances, which are ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to convince us, that if the word of GOD will not awaken and convert ſinners, nothing will.—And we ſee enough in theſe days to convince us of it. Men ſometimes meet with thoſe things, by which we ſhould not imagine, if we did not ſee it, and were not uſed to it, but that they would be thoroughly awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kened and reformed. They ſometimes hear the warnings of dying men, men who are expecting to go to hell. One would think, this would be enough to awaken them; and it may be they are affected with it for the preſent: but it does but juſt touch them; vaniſhes away and is gone like a puff of wind.</p>
               <p>SOMETIMES ſinners themſelves are laid upon beds of ſickneſs, and their lives hang in doubt before them. They are brought to the ſides of the grave, and to
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:016767_0103_0F9E176940C82648"/>
the very mouth of hell, and their hearts are full of terror and amazement. Yet if they recover they ſoon forget it and return to the ways of folly and wickedneſs.—Sometimes this is repeated; they are taken ſick again, are again in extreme peril of death, their hearts are full of amazement, and they make ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promiſes and vows; yet being recovered they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain ſoon forget all and return to ſin and folly. Such things are enough to convince us, that if the word of GOD be not ſufficient to convince men, and make them break off their ſins, no external means would be ſufficient.</p>
               <p>PERHAPS ſome may yet be ready to think, that if ſinners ſhould ſee hell, and hear the cries of the damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that would be effectual, though nothing elſe would. But if we duly conſider the matter, we ſhall ſee reaſon to think, that that would not have ſo great a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to turn men from ſin to GOD, as the word of GOD. Such a thing would doubtleſs be effectual to terrify and affright men, and probably to affright them to death.—Such a mean is not at all ſuitable to our nature and ſtate in the world. If it ſhould not fright men to death, it would not have ſo great a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to make them diligently uſe means for their ſalvation, as the warnings of ſcripture. It would probably drive them to deſpair; it would ſo take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way all their ſpirits, that they would have no heart to ſeek GOD. Inſtead of driving them to GOD, it would probably make them hate GOD the more. It would make them more like devils; and ſet them a blaſpheming as the damned do. For while the hearts of men are filled with natural darkneſs, they cannot ſee the glory of the divine juſtice, appearing in ſuch extreme torments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="unknown:016767_0104_0F9E1769F02C0FD0"/>
THEREFORE GOD'S means, the means which he hath inſtituted for us, are doubtleſs the beſt, and moſt conducive to lead men to repentance and ſalvation. They are doubtleſs far better than any other, which we can deviſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. HENCE we learn the dreadful hardneſs of men's hearts, as the word of GOD hath no more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon them, and as they are no more moved and wrought upon by thoſe beſt means, which infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wiſdom hath provided. The warnings of the word of GOD are, as you have heard, better and more powerful means, than if one ſhould riſe from the dead to warn us, and tell us our danger, and the dreadfulneſs of the wrath of GOD. You have alſo heard that if theſe means will not anſwer the end of awakening and leading ſinners to repentance, no other will, neither the working of miracles, nor the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of GOD ſpeak with an audible voice from heaven, nor any thing elſe.—Yet how few are there, who are effectually wrought upon by the word of GOD! They are very thinly ſown; there is but here and there one.</p>
               <p>WHEN we read how the children of Iſrael con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted themſelves in the wilderneſs, how often they murmured and offended; we are ready to wonder at the hardneſs of their hearts. And when we read the hiſtory of CHRIST, and how the Jews halted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected him notwithſtanding his many miracles; we are ready to wonder how they could be ſo (doubt)hard-hearted. But we have as much reaſon to wonder at ourſelves; for we have naturally the ſame ſort of hearts that they had; and ſinners in theſe days mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> hardneſs of heart as much to be wondered at, in that they are not influenced by the word of GOD; for they who will not hear Moſes and the prophets,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:016767_0105_0F9E176B5AD5CBF8"/>
JESUS CHRIST and his apoſtles, neither would be perſuaded, if one ſhould riſe from the dead, or if an angel ſhould come from heaven.</p>
               <p>THE beſt means of awakening and converſion are exceeding plentifully enjoyed by us, much more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in ſeveral reſpects, than they were by thoſe who had only Moſes and the prophets. In the firſt place we have divine truth abundantly more fully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the bible, than they had then. Light now ſhines abundantly clear. Goſpel truth is revealed not in types and ſhadows, but plainly. Heaven and hell are much more clearly and expreſly made known. We are told that the glory of that revelation was no glory in compariſon with the glory of the revelation of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, we have a greater plenty of bibles, than they had under the diſpenſation of Moſes and the prophets. Then there was no ſuch thing as print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and bibles were ſcarce things. They ſeldom had any bibles, any where elſe but in their ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues. But now we have them in our houſes; we can look into them when we pleaſe.—Beſides, CHRIST hath appointed the goſpel miniſtry, by which we have the word of GOD explained and enforced every week.—Yet how little influence hath the word of GOD to bring men to repentance!</p>
               <p>LET this ſtrike conviction into thoſe, who never yet have found any ſuch effect by the word of GOD Though you are convinced of nothing elſe, yet you have abundant reaſon to be convinced, that your hearts are as hard as a ſtone, and that you are exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſtupid and ſottiſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3. HENCE we may learn how juſtly and fairly GOD deals with us. He gives us the beſt means of awakening and reclaiming us from our ſins; better
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:016767_0106_0F9E176B6E451BA8"/>
than if he had ſent one from the dead to warn us. He gives us thoſe means which are moſt ſuited to our nature and circumſtances. He gives ſinners abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant warning before he puniſhes them. What could he have done more, than he hath done? We can deviſe or imagine no ſort of warning, which would have been better, than what GOD hath given us.—How juſtly therefore are ungodly men puniſhed; how inexcuſable will they be.</p>
               <p n="4">4. LET all make uſe of the means, which GOD hath inſtituted. They are the beſt and only means by which we may expect to obtain ſalvation. We ſhall be moſt inexcuſable therefore, if we neglect them. Let us attend to the word of GOD, read and hear it carefully, conſider it thoroughly, and daily walk by it. Let us be diligent in this work. The word of GOD is a great price put into our hands to get wiſdom and eternal ſalvation; let us therefore improve it, while we have it, as we know not how ſoon we may be deprived of it; leſt CHRIST ſay to us, as in Luke xix 42.

            <p n="1">1. WHO it is that is here ſpoken of, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the hypocrite; as you may ſee, if you take the two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding verſes with the verſe of the text. <q>For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained; when GOD taketh away his ſoul? Will GOD hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him? Will he delight himſelf in the Almighty? Will he always call upon GOD?</q> Job's three friends in their ſpeeches to him inſiſted much upon it, that he was an hypocrite. But Job in this chapter aſſerts his ſincerity and integrity, and ſhows how different his own behaviour had been from that of hypocrites. Particularly he declares his ſtedfaſt and immovable reſolution of perſevering and holding out in the ways of religion and righteouſneſs to the end;
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:016767_0108_0F9E176DB135CF10"/>
as you may ſee in the ſix firſt verſes.—In the text he ſhows how contrary to this ſtedfaſtneſs and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, the character of the hypocrite is, who is not wont thus to hold out in religion.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE may obſerve what duty of religion it is, with reſpect to which the hypocrite is decyphered in the text, and that is the duty of <hi>prayer</hi> or calling up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on GOD.</p>

SOMETHING aſſerted, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that it is not the manner of hypocrites to continue <hi>always</hi> in this duty. <hi>Will be always call upon GOD?</hi> It is in the form of an interrogation; but the words have the force of a ſtrong negation, or of an aſſertion that however the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite may call upon GOD for a ſeaſon, yet he will not always continue in it.</p>

               </p>
               <p>I. I WOULD ſhow how hypocrites often continue for a ſeaſon in the duty of prayer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THEY do ſo for a while after they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:016767_0109_0F9E176E62B27A10"/>
common illuminations and affections. While they are under awakenings, they may through fear of hell call upon GOD, and attend very conſtantly upon the duty of ſecret prayer. And after they have had ſome melting affections, having their hearts much moved with the goodneſs of GOD, or with ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting encouragements, and falſe joy and comfort; while theſe impreſſions laſt, they continue to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on GOD in the duty of ſecret prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. AFTER they have obtained an hope, and have made profeſſion of their good eſtate, they often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for a while in the duty of ſecret prayer. For a while they are affected with their hope: they think that GOD hath delivered them out of a natural condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and given them an intereſt in CHRIST, thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing them into a ſtate of ſafety from that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery, which they lately feared. With this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed kindneſs of GOD to them, they are much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, and often find in themſelves, for a while, a kind of love to GOD, excited by his ſuppoſed love to them. Now while this affection towards GOD con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, the duties of religion ſeem pleaſant to them; it is even with ſome delight that they approach to GOD in their cloſets; and for the preſent, it may be, they think of no other than continuing to call upon GOD, as long as they live.</p>
               <p>YEA they may continue in the duty of ſecret pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for a while after the livelineſs of their affections is paſt; partly through the influence of their former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions: They intended to continue ſeeking GOD al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; and now ſuddenly to leave off, would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be too ſhocking to their own minds. And part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through the force of their own preconceived no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and what they have always believed, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that godly perſons do continue in religion, and that their goodneſs is not like the morning cloud. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:016767_0110_0F9E17722A7C3498"/>
though they have no love to the duty of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and begin to grow weary of it; yet as they love their own hope, they are ſome-what backward to take a courſe, which will prove it to be a falſe hope, and ſo deprive them of it.</p>
               <p>IF they ſhould at once carry themſelves ſo as they have always been taught is a ſign of a falſe hope, they would ſcare themſelves. Their hope is dear to them, and it would ſcare them to ſee any plain evidence that it is not true. Hence, for a conſiderable time after the force of their illuminations and affections is over, and after they hate the duty of prayer, and would be glad to have done with it, if they could, without ſhowing themſelves to be hypocrites; they hold up a kind of attendance upon the duty of ſecret prayer.—This may keep up the outſide of religion in them for a good while, and occaſion it to be ſome what ſlowly, that they are brought to neglect it. They muſt not leave off ſuddenly, becauſe that would be too great a ſhock to their falſe peace. But they muſt come gradually to it, as they find their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences can bear it, and as they can find out devices and ſalvo's to cover over the matter, and make their ſo doing conſiſtent, in their own opinion, with the truth of their hope. But</p>
               <p>II. IT is the manner of hypocrites after a while in a great meaſure to leave off the practice of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. We are often taught that the ſeeming goodneſs and piety of hypocrites is not of a laſting and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering nature. It is ſo with reſpect to their practice of the duty of prayer in particular, and eſpecially of ſecret prayer. They can omit this duty, and their omiſſion of it not be taken notice of by others, who know what profeſſion they have made. So that regard to their own reputation doth not oblige then ſtill to practiſe it. If others ſaw how they neglect it
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:016767_0111_0F9E1773440C54C8"/>
it would exceedingly ſhock their charity towards them. But their neglect doth not fall under their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; at leaſt not under the obſervation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. Therefore they may omit this duty, and ſtill have the credit of being converted perſons.</p>
               <p>MEN of this character can come to a neglect of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret prayer by degrees without very much ſhocking their peace. For though indeed for a converted per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to live in a great meaſure without ſecret prayer, is very wide of the notion they once had of a true convert; yet they find means by degrees to alter their notions, and to bring their principles to ſuit with their inclinations; and at length they come to that, in their notions of things, that a man may be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, and yet live very much in neglect of this duty. In time they can bring all things to ſuit well together, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n hope of heaven, and an indulgence of ſloth in gratifying carnal appetites, and living in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a prayerleſs life. They cannot indeed ſuddenly make theſe things agree; it muſt be a work of time; and length of time will effect it. By degrees they find out ways to guard and defend their conſciences againſt thoſe powerful enemies; ſo that thoſe ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and a quiet, ſecure conſcience, can at length dwell prety well together.</p>
               <p>WHEREAS it is aſſerted in the doctrine, that it is the manner of hypocrites, after a while, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to leave off this duty; I would obſerve to you,</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT it is not intended but that they may commonly continue to the end of life in yielding an external attendance on open prayer, or prayer with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="116" facs="unknown:016767_0112_0F9E177501479F18"/>
Many vicious perſons, who make no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to ſerious religion, commonly attend pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick prayers in the congregation, and alſo more pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayers in the families in which they live, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be when carnal deſigns interfere, or when their youthful pleaſures and diverſions, and their vain company call them: and then they make no conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of attending family-prayer. Otherwiſe they may continue to attend upon prayer as long as they live, and yet may truly be ſaid not to call upon GOD. For ſuch prayer in the manner of it, is not their own. They are preſent only for the ſake of their credit, or in compliance with others. They may be preſent at theſe prayers and yet have no proper prayer of their own. Many of thoſe concerning whom it may be ſaid, as in Job. xv. 4. That <hi>they caſt off fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain prayer before GOD,</hi> are yet frequently preſent at family and publick prayers.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BUT they in a great meaſure leave off the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of <hi>ſecret</hi> prayer. They come to this paſs, by degrees. At firſt they begin to be careleſs about it, under ſome particular temptations. Becauſe they have been out in young company, or have been taken up very much with worldly buſineſs, they omit it once: after that they more eaſily omit it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>again. Thus it preſently becomes a frequent thing with them to omit it; and after a while it comes to that paſs, that they ſeldom attend it. Perhaps they attend it on ſabbath days, and ſometimes on other days. But they have ceaſed to make it a conſtant practice, daily to retire to worſhip GOD alone, and to ſeek his face in ſecret places. They ſometimes do a little to quiet conſcience, and juſt to keep alive their old hope; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it would be ſhocking to them, even after all their ſubtil dealing with their conſciences, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

themſelves converts, and yet totally to live without prayer. Yet the practice of ſecret prayer they have in a great meaſure left off.—I come now</p>
               <p>III. TO the reaſons, why this is the manner of hypocrites.</p>
               <p n="1">1. HYPOCRITES never had the ſpirit of prayer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them. They may have been ſtirred up to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal performance of this duty, and that with a great deal of earneſtneſs and affection, and yet always have been deſtitute of the true ſpirit of prayer. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of prayer is an holy ſpirit, a gracious ſpirit. We read of the ſpirit of grace and ſupplication; Zech. xii. 10. I will pour out on the houſe of David and the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, the <hi>ſpirit of grace and ſupplications.</hi>—Wherever there is a true ſpirit of ſupplication, there is the ſpirit of grace. The true ſpirit of prayer is no other than GOD'S own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the hearts of the ſaints. And as this ſpirit comes from GOD, ſo doth it naturally tend to GOD in holy breathings and pantings. It naturally leads to GOD, to converſe with him by prayer. Therefore the ſpirit is ſaid to make interceſſion for the ſaints, with groanings which cannot be uttered. Rom. viii. 26.</p>
               <p>THE ſpirit of GOD makes interceſſion for them, as it is that ſpirit which in ſome reſpect indites their prayers, and leads them ſo and ſo to pour out their ſouls before GOD. Therefore the ſaints are ſaid to worſhip GOD in the <hi>ſpirit;</hi> Phil. iii. 3. We are the circumciſion who worſhip GOD in the ſpirit. And Joh. iv. 23. The true worſhippers worſhip the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſpirit and in truth. The truly godly have the ſpirit of adoption, the ſpirit of a child, to which it is natural to go to GOD and call upon him, crying to him as to a father.</p>
               <p>BUT hypocrites have nothing of this ſpirit of adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:016767_0114_0F9E1775E5436DC0"/>
They have not the ſpirit of children; for this is a gracious and holy ſpirit, only given in a real work of regeneration. Therefore it is often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as a part of the diſtinguiſhing character of the godly, that they call upon GOD. Pſal. cxlv. 18, 19. The LORD is nigh to them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. He will fulfil the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of them that fear him; he will alſo hear their cry; and will ſave them. Joel ii. 32. It ſhall come to paſs that whoſoever calleth on the name of the LORD ſhall be delivered.</p>
               <p>IT is natural to one who is truly born from above to pray to GOD, and to pour out his ſoul in holy ſupplications before his heavenly father. This is as natural to the new nature and life as breathing is to the nature and life of the body. But hypocrites have not this new nature. Thoſe illuminations and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they had, went away and left no change of nature. Therefore prayer naturally dies away in them, having no foundation for the keeping of it up, laid in the nature of the ſoul. It is maintained, while it is maintained, only by a certain force put upon na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture But force is not conſtant; and as that declines, nature will take place again.</p>
               <p>THE ſpirit of a true convert is a ſpirit of true love to GOD, and that naturally inclines the ſoul to thoſe duties wherein it is converſant with GOD, and makes it to delight in approaching to GOD. But an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite hath no ſuch ſpirit. He is left under the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of enmity againſt GOD, which naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines him to ſhun the preſence of GOD.</p>
               <p>THE ſpirit of a true convert is a ſpirit of faith and reliance on the power, wiſdom and mercy of GOD, and ſuch a ſpirit is naturally expreſſed in prayer. True prayer is nothing elſe but faith expreſſed. Hence
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:016767_0115_0F9E1776B4B92970"/>
we read of <hi>the prayer of faith;</hi> James v. 15. True Chriſtian prayer is the faith and reliance of the ſoul breathed forth in words. But an hypocrite is without the ſpirit of faith. He hath no true reliance or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on God, but is really ſelf-dependent.</p>
               <p>AS to thoſe common convictions and affections, which the hypocrite had, and which made him keep up the duty of prayer for a while; they not reaching the bottom of the heart, nor being accompanied with any change of nature, a little thing extinguiſhes them. The cares of the world commonly choke and ſuffocate them, and often the pleaſures and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of youth totally put an end to them, and with them ends their conſtant practice of the duty of prayer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. WHEN an hypocrite hath had his falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, his wants are in his ſenſe of things already ſupplied, his deſires are already anſwered; and ſo he finds no further buſineſs at the throne of grace. He never was ſenſible that he had any other needs, but a need of being ſafe from hell. And now that he is converted, as he thinks, that need is ſupplied. Why then ſhould he ſtill go on to reſort to the throne of grace with earneſt requeſts? He is out of danger: all that he was afraid of is removed: he hath got enough to carry him to heaven, and what more ſhould he deſire?—While he was under awakenings he had this to ſtir him up to go to GOD in prayer, that he was in continual fear of hell. This put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on crying to GOD for mercy. But ſince in his own opinion he is converted, he hath no further buſineſs about which to go to GOD. And although he may keep up the duty of prayer in the outward form a little while, for fear of ſpoiling his hope; yet he will find a dull buſineſs of continuing it without any need <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> neceſſity, and ſo by degrees he will let drop the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:016767_0116_0F9E1777638064E8"/>
practice. The work of the hypocrite is done, when he is converted; and therefore he ſtandeth in no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need of help.</p>
               <p>BUT it is far otherwiſe with the true convert. His work is not done; but he finds ſtill a great work to do, and great wants to be ſupplied. He ſees him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſtill to be a poor, empty helpleſs creature, and that he ſtill ſtands in great and continual need of GOD'S help. He is ſenſible that without GOD he can do nothing. A falſe converſion makes a man in his own eyes ſelf-ſufficient. He faith he is rich and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with goods and hath need of nothing; and knoweth not that he is wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked. But after a true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, the ſoul remains ſenſible of it's own impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and emptineſs, as it is in itſelf, and it's ſenſe of it is rather increaſed than diminiſhed. It is ſtill ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of it's univerſal dependence on GOD for every thing. A true convert is ſenſible that his grace is very imperfect; and he is very far from having all that he deſires. Inſtead of that, by converſion are begotten in him new deſires, which he never had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He now finds in him holy appetites, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering and thirſting after righteouſneſs, a longing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more acquaintance and communion with GOD, So that he hath buſineſs enough ſtill at the throne of grace; yea his buſineſs there, inſtead of being dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, is ſince his converſion rather increaſed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE hope which the hypocrite hath of his good eſtate, takes off the force that the command of GOD before had upon his conſcience; ſo that now he dares neglect ſo plain a duty. The command which requires the practice of the duty of prayer is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plain; Mat. xxvi. 41. Watch and p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>y, that ye enter not into temptation, Eph. vi. 18. Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:016767_0117_0F9E177847F3ACD0"/>
always with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit, and watching thereunto with <hi>all perſeverance,</hi> and ſupplication for all ſaints. Mat. vi. 6. When thou prayeſt enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut thy door, pray to thy father which is in ſecret. As long as the hypocrite was in his own apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in continual danger of hell, he durſt not diſobey theſe commands. But ſince he is, as he thinks, ſafe from hell, he is grown bold, he dares to live in the neglect of the plaineſt command in the bible.</p>
               <p n="4">4. IT is the manner of hypocrites after a while to return to ſinful practices, which will tend to keep them from praying. While they were under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions, they reformed their lives, and walked very exactly. This reformation continues for a little time perhaps, after their ſuppoſed converſion, while they are much affected with hope and falſe comfort. But as theſe things die away, their old luſts revive, and they by degrees return like the dog to his vomit, and the ſow that was waſhed to her wallowing in the mire. They return to their ſenſual practices, to their worldly practices, to their proud and contentious practices, as before. And no wonder this makes them forſake their cloſets. Sinning and praying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree not well together. If a man be conſtant in the duty of ſecret prayer, it will tend to reſtrain him from wilful ſinning. So on the other hand, if he allow himſelf in ſinful practices, it will reſtrain him from praying. It will give quite another turn to his mind, ſo that he will have no diſpoſition to the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſuch a duty: it will be contrary to him. A man who knows, that he lives in ſin againſt GOD, will not be inclined to come daily into the preſence of GOD; but will rather be inclined to fly from his preſence, as Adam, when he had eaten of the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:016767_0118_0F9E177C613DA0D8"/>
fruit, ran away from GOD, and hid himſelf among the trees of the garden.</p>
               <p>TO keep up the duty of prayer, after he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven looſe to his luſts, would tend very much to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet a man's conſcience. It would give advantage to his conſcience to teſtify aloud againſt him. If he ſhould come from his wickedneſs into the preſence of GOD, immediately to ſpeak to him, his conſcience would, as it were, fly in his face. Therefore hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites, as they by degrees admit their wicked practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, exclude payer.</p>
               <p n="5">5. HYPOCRITES never counted the coſt of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance in ſeeking GOD and of following him to the end of life. To continue inſtant in prayer with all perſeverance to the end of life, requires much care, watchfulneſs and labour. For much oppoſition is made to it, by the fleſh, the world and the devil; and <hi>chriſtians</hi> meet with many temptations to forſake this practice. He that would perſevere in this duty, muſt be laborious in religion in general. But hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites never count the coſt of ſuch labour; i. e. they never were prepared in the diſpoſition of their minds to give their lives to the ſervice of GOD, and to the duties of religion. It is therefore no great wonder they are weary and give out, after they have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a while, as their affections are gone, and they find that prayer to them grows irkſome and tedious.</p>
               <p n="6">6. HYPOCRITES have no intereſt in thoſe graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes, which GOD hath made to his people, of thoſe ſpiritual ſupplies, which are needful in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to uphold them in the way of their duty to the end. GOD hath promiſed to true ſaints, that they ſhall not forſake him. Jer. xxxii. 40. I will put my fear into their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me. He hath promiſed that he will keep them
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:016767_0119_0F9E177EF1D5D7D0"/>
in the way of their duty; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>I.

               <p>BUT if your caſe be ſuch as is ſpoken of in the doctrine, it is ſurely time for you to ſeek a better hope and another work of GOD'S ſpirit, than ever you have yet experienced; ſomething more thorough and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual. When you ſee and find by experience that the ſeed which was ſown in your hearts, though at firſt it ſprang up and ſeemed flouriſhing, yet is wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away, as by the heat of the ſun, or is choaked, as with thorns; this ſhows in what ſort of ground the ſeed was ſown, that it is either ſtony or thorny ground; and that therefore it is neceſſary you ſhould paſs through another change, whereby your heart may become good ground, which ſhall bring forth fruit with patience.</p>
               <p>INSIST not on that as a reaſon why you ſhould not throw away your hope, that you had the judgment of others that the change of which you were the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject was right. It is a ſmall matter to be judged of man's judgment, whether you be approved or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, and whether it be by miniſter or people, wiſe or unwiſe. I. Cor. iv. 3. <q>It is a very ſmall thing that I ſhould be judged of you or of man's judgment.</q> If your goodneſs have proved to be as the morning cloud and early dew; if you be one of thoſe, who have forſaken GOD and left off calling upon his name; you have the judgment of GOD, and the ſentence of GOD in the ſcriptures againſt you, which is a thouſand times more than to have the
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:016767_0121_0F9E178137C28940"/>
judgment of all the wiſe and godly men and miniſters in the world in your favour.</p>
               <p>OTHERS, from your account of things, may have been obliged to have charity for you, and to think that, provided you were not miſtaken, and in your account did not miſrepreſent things, or expreſs them by wrong terms, you were really converted. But what a miſerable foundation is this, upon which to build an hope as to your eternal ſtate!</p>
               <p>HERE I requeſt your attention to a few things in particular, which I have to ſay to you concerning your hope.</p>
               <p>I. WHY will you retain that hope, which by evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent experience you find poiſons you? Is it reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to think, that an holy hope, an hope that is from heaven, would have ſuch an influence? No ſurely, nothing of ſuch a malignent influence comes from that world of purity and glory. No poiſon groweth in the paradiſe of GOD. The ſame hope, which leads men to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n this world, will lead to hell hereafter. Why therefore will you retain ſuch an hope, of which your own experience ſhows you the ill tendency, in that it encourages you to lead a wicked life? For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly that life is a wicked life, wherein you live in the neglect of ſo well known a duty, as that of ſecret prayer, and in the diſobedience of ſo plain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of GOD, as that by which this duty is enjoined. And is not a way of diſobedience to GOD, a way to hell?</p>
               <p>IF your own experience of the nature and tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of your hope, will not convince you of the falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, what will? Are you reſolved to retain your hope, let it prove ever ſo unſound and hurtful? Will you hold it faſt, till you go to hell with it? Many men cling to a falſe hope and embrace it ſo cloſely
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:016767_0122_0F9E1782A6418888"/>
that they never let it go, till the flames of hell cauſe their arms to unclinch and let go their hold.—Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how you will anſwer it at the day of judgment, when GOD ſhall call you to an account for your folly in reſting in ſuch an hope. Will it be a ſufficient anſwer for you to ſay, that you had the charity of others, and that they thought your converſion was right?</p>
               <p>CERTAINLY it is fooliſh for men to imagine, that GOD had no more wiſdom, or could contrive no other way of beſtowing comfort and hope of eternal life, than one which ſhould encourage men to forſake him.</p>

            <epigraph>

            <p>HOWEVER hypocrites may continue for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the duty of prayer, yet it is their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner after a while, in a great meaſure to leave it off.</p>
            <p>THIS doctrine was our ſubject in the preceeding diſcourſe, in which, after having ſhown—how hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites often continue for a ſeaſon to call upon GOD—how it is their manner after a while, in a great meaſure, to leave it off—and having given the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why this is their manner; I came at length to make <hi>application,</hi> which I propoſed to do in an uſe of <hi>exhortation</hi> in two branches; and firſt to exhort thoſe who entertain an hope of their good eſtate and yet live in the neglect of ſecret prayer, to reject their hope. One particular conſideration I have already laid before men of this character, to the end juſt mentioned; and I now proceed to ſay to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="unknown:016767_0124_0F9E178427288558"/>
2. HOW is your doing, as you do, conſiſtent with loving GOD above all. If you have not a ſpirit to love GOD above your deareſt earthly friends, and your moſt pleaſant earthly enjoyments; the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are very plain and full in it, that you are not true chriſtians. But if you had indeed ſuch a ſpirit, would you thus grow weary of the practice of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to him, and become habitually ſo averſe to it, as in a great meaſure to caſt off ſo plain a duty, which is ſo much the life of a child of GOD? It is the nature of love to be averſe to abſence, and to love a near acceſs to thoſe whom we love. We love to be with them; we delight to come often to them, and to have much converſation with them. But when a perſon, who hath heretofore been wont to converſe freely with another, by degrees forſakes him, grows ſtrange, and converſes with him but little, and that although the other be importunate with him for the continuance of their former intimacy; this plainly ſhows the coldneſs of his heart towards him.</p>
            <p>THE neglect of the duty of prayer ſeems to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with ſupreme love to GOD alſo upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther account, and that is that it is againſt the will of GOD ſo plainly revealed. True love to GOD ſeeks to pleaſe GOD in every thing, and univerſally to conform to his will.</p>
            <p>3. YOUR thus reſtraining prayer before GOD is not only inconſiſtent with the love, but alſo with the fear of GOD. It is an argument that you caſt off fear, as is manifeſt by that text, Job. xv. 4. <hi>Yea thou caſteſt off fear and reſtraineſt prayer before God.</hi> While you thus live in the tranſgreſſion of ſo plain a command of GOD, you evidently ſhow, that there is no fear of GOD before your eyes.

4. CONSIDER how living in ſuch a neglect is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with leading an holy life. We are abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed in ſcripture, that true chriſtians do lead an holy life; that without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the LORD, Heb. xii. 14. And that every one that hath this hope in him, purifyeth himſelf, even as CHRIST is pure I Joh. iii. 3.—In Prov. xvi. 17. It is ſaid, The <hi>high way</hi> of the upright is to depart from evil; i. e. it is, as it were, the common beaten road, in which all the godly travel.—To the like purpoſe is Iſai. xxxv. 8. A <hi>high way</hi> ſhall be there, and a way, and it ſhall be called the <hi>way of holineſs;</hi> the unclean ſhall not paſs over it, but it ſhall be for <hi>thoſe;</hi> i. e. thoſe redeemed perſons ſpoken of in the foregoing verſes.—It is ſpoken of in Rom. Viii, 1. as the character of all believers, that they walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>BUT how is a life in a great meaſure prayerleſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with an holy life? To lead an holy life is to lead a life devoted to GOD; a life of worſhipping and ſerving GOD; a life conſecrated to the ſervice of GOD. But how doth he lead ſuch a life, who doth not ſo much as maintain the duty of prayer? How can ſuch a man be ſaid to walk by the ſpirit, and to be a ſervant of the moſt high GOD.—An holy life is a life of faith. The life that true Chriſtians live in the world, they live by the faith of the ſon of GOD. But who can believe that that man lives by faith, who lives without prayer which is the natural expreſſion of faith? Prayer is as natural an expreſſion of faith, as breathing is of life; and to ſay a man lives a life of faith, and yet lives a prayerleſs life, is every whit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> inconſiſtent and incredible, as to ſay that a man lives without breathing. A prayerleſs life is ſo far from being an holy life that it is a profane life: he
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:016767_0126_0F9E1785EC306890"/>
that lives ſo, lives like an heathen, who calleth not on GOD'S name: he that lives a prayerleſs life, lives without GOD in the world.</p>
            <p>5. IF you live in the neglect of ſecret prayer, you ſhow your goodwill to neglect all the worſhip of GOD. He that prays only when he prays with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, would not pray at all, were it not, that the eyes of others are upon him. He that will not pray where none but GOD ſeeth him, manifeſtly doth not pray at all out of reſpect to GOD, or regard to his all ſeeing eye, and therefore doth in effect caſt off all prayer. And he that caſts off prayer, in effect caſts off all the worſhip of GOD, of which prayer is the principal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Now what a miſerable ſaint is he, who is no worſhipper of GOD! He that caſts off the worſhip of GOD, in effect caſts off GOD himſelf: he refuſes to own him, or to be converſant with him as his God. For the way in which men own GOD and are conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with him as their GOD, is by worſhipping him.</p>
            <p>6. How can you expect to dwell with GOD fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver if you ſo neglect and forſake him here? This your practice ſhows, that you place not your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in GOD, in nearneſs to him, and communion with him. He who refuſes to come and viſit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with a friend, and who in a great meaſure forſake him, when he is abundantly invited and importuned to come; plainly ſhows that he places not his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the company and converſation of that friend. Now if this be the caſe with you reſpecting GOD, then how can you expect to have it for your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all eternity, to be with GOD, and to enjoy holy communion with him?</p>
            <p>LET thoſe perſons who hope they are converted, and yet have in a great meaſure left off the duty of ſecret prayer, and whoſe manner it is ordinarily to neglect it, for their own ſake ſeriouſly conſider theſe
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:016767_0127_0F9E178689924588"/>
things. For what will profit them to pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with <hi>that,</hi> while they live, which will fail them at laſt, and leave them in fearful and amazing diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment?</p>
            <p>IT is probable that ſome of you, who have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a good opinion of your ſtate, and have looked upon yourſelves as converts; but have of late in a great meaſure left off the duty of ſecret prayer; will this evening attend ſecret prayer; and ſo may conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to do, for a little while after your hearing this ſermon, to the end, that you may ſolve the difficulty and the objection which is made againſt the truth of your hope. But this will not hold. As it hath been in former inſtances of the like nature, ſo what you now hear, will have ſuch effect upon you, but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle while. When the buſineſs and cares of the world ſhall again begin to crowd a little upon you, or the next time you ſhall go out into young company, it is probable you will again neglect this duty. The next time a <hi>frolick</hi> ſhall be appointed, to which it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to you to go, it is highly probable you will neglect not only ſecret prayer, but alſo family-pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Or at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eaſt, after a while you will come to the ſame paſs again, as before, in caſting off fear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffraining prayer before GOD.</p>
            <p>IT is not very likely that you will ever <hi>be conſtant and perſevering in this duty, until you</hi> ſhall have obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a better principle in your hearts, until you ſhall have paſſed an otherguiſe change than ever you have yet paſſed. The ſtreams which have no ſprings to feed them, will dry up. The drought and heat conſume the ſnow-waters. Although they run plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully in the ſpring, yet when the ſun aſcends high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er with a burning heat, they are gone. The ſeed that is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>own in ſtony places, though it ſeem to flouriſh at
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:016767_0128_0F9E1787999ADEE0"/>
preſent, yet as the ſun ſhall riſe with a burning heat, will wither away. None will bring forth fruit with patience, but thoſe whoſe hearts are become good ground.</p>
            <p>WITHOUT any heavenly ſeed remaining in them, men may, whenever they fall in among the godly, continue all their lives to talk like ſaints. They may for their credit ſake tell of what they have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, but their <hi>deeds</hi> will not hold. They may continue to tell of their inward experiences, and yet live in the neglect of ſecret prayer and of other duties.</p>
            <p>II. I WOULD take occaſion from this doctrine to exhort all to perſevere in the duty of prayer. This exhortation is much inſiſted on in the word of GOD. It is inſiſted on in the old teſtament. 1 Chron. xvi. 11. <q>Seek the LORD and his ſtrength, ſeek his face <hi>continually.</hi>
               </q> Iſai. lxii. 7. <q>Ye that make menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the LORD, keep not ſilence;</q> i. e. be not ſilent as to the voice of prayer, as is manifeſt by the following words, <q>and give him no reſt, till he eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh and till he make Jeruſalem a praiſe in the earth.</q> Iſrael of old is reproved for growing wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the duty of prayer. Iſai. xliii. 22. <q>But thou haſt not called upon me, O Jacob, thou haſt been weary of me, O Iſrael.</q>
            </p>
            <p>PERSEVERANCE in the duty of prayer is very much inſiſted on in the new teſtament; as Luke xviii. at the beginning, <q>a man ought always to pray and not to faint;</q> i. e. not to be diſcouraged or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the duty; but ſhould always continue in it. Again Luke xxi. 36. Watch ye therefore and pray <hi>always.</hi> We have the example of Anna the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheteſs ſet before us Luke i. 36 &amp;c. Who though ſhe had lived to be more than an hundred years old,
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:016767_0129_0F9E1787E35092B8"/>
yet never was weary of this duty. It is ſaid, <q>She departed not from the temple, but ſerved GOD with faſtings and prayers night and day.</q> Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius alſo is commended for his conſtancy in this duty. It is ſaid that he prayed to GOD always; Acts x. 2. The apoſtle Paul in his epiſtles inſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ts very much on conſtancy in this duty. Rom. xii. 12. <q>Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inſtant in prayer.</q>—Eph. vi. 18, 19. <q>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit and watching thereunto with all perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</q> Col. iv. 2. <q>Continue in prayer and watch in the ſame.</q> 1 Theſs. v. 17. <q>Pray without ceaſing.</q> To the ſame effect the apoſtle Peter; 1 Pet. iv. 7. "Watch unto prayer."—Thus abundantly the ſcriptures inſiſt upon it, that we ſhould perſevere in the duty of prayer; which ſhows that it is of very great importance, that we ſhould perſevere. If the contrary be the manner of hypocrites, as hath been ſhown in the doctrine, then ſurely we ought to beware of this leaven.</p>
            <p>BUT here let the following things be particularly conſidered as motives to perſeverance in this duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT perſeverance in the way of duty is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation, and is abundantly declared ſo to be in the holy ſcriptures; as Iſai. lxiv. 5. <q>Thou meeteſt him that rejoiceth and worketh righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, thoſe that remember thee in thy ways: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, thou art wroth, for we have ſinned: in thoſe is <hi>continuance</hi> and we ſhall be ſaved.</q> Heb. x. 38 and 39. <q>Now the juſt ſhall live by faith: but if any man <hi>draw back,</hi> my ſoul hath no pleaſure in him. But we are not of them who <hi>draw back unto perdition;</hi> but of them that believe to the ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſoul.</q> Rom. xi 22. <q>Behold there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the goodneſs and ſeverity of GOD: on the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="134" facs="unknown:016767_0130_0F9E178B5746ADE0"/>
which fell, ſeverity; but towards thee, goodneſs, if thou <hi>continue</hi> in his goodneſs; <hi>otherwiſe</hi> thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhalt be cut off.</q> So in many other places.</p>
            <p>MANY, when they think they are converted, ſeem to imagine that their work is done, and that there is nothing elſe needful in order to their going to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.—Indeed perſeverance in holineſs of life is not neceſſary to ſalvation, as the righteouſneſs by which a right to ſalvation is obtained. Nor is actual perſeverance neceſſary in order to our becoming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in that righteouſneſs by which we are juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For as ſoon as ever a ſoul hath believed in CHRIST, or hath put forth one act of faith in him, it becomes intereſted in his righteouſneſs, and in all the promiſes purchaſed by it.</p>
            <p>BUT perſevering in the way of duty is neceſſary to ſalvation, as a concomitant and evidence of a title to ſalvation. There is never a title to ſalvation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, though it be not the righteouſneſs by which a title to ſalvation is obtained. It is neceſſary to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as it is the neceſſary conſequence of true faith. It is an evidence which univerſally attends upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the defect of it, is an infallible evidence of the want of uprightneſs. Pſal. cxxv. 4. 5. There ſuch as are good and upright in heart, are diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from ſuch as fall away, or turn aſide: <q>Do good, O LORD, to thoſe that are good, and to them that are upright in their hearts. As for ſuch as <hi>turn aſide to their crooked ways,</hi> the LORD ſhall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity. But peace ſhall be upon Iſrael.</q>—It is mentioned as an evidence that the hearts of the children of Iſrael were not right with God, that they did not perſevere in the ways of holineſs. Pſal. lxxviii. 8. <q>A ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that ſet not their hearts aright, and whoſe ſpirit was not <hi>ſtedfaſt</hi> with GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="135" facs="unknown:016767_0131_0F9E178C658BF428"/>
CHRIST gives this as a diſtinguiſhing character of thoſe that are his <hi>diſciples indeed,</hi> and of a true and ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith, that it is accompanied with perſeverance in the obedience of CHRIST'S word. Joh. viii. 31. <q>Then ſaid JESUS to thoſe Jews which believed on him, if ye <hi>continue</hi> in my word, then are ye my diſciples indeed.</q> This is mentioned as a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary evidence of an intereſt in CHRIST, Heb. iii. 14. <q>We are made partakers of CHRIST, if we hold the beginning of our confidence ſtedfaſt to the end.</q>
            </p>
            <p>PERSEVERANCE is not only a neceſſary concomitant and evidence of a title to ſalvation, but alſo a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary prerequiſite to the actual poſſeſſion of eternal life. It is the only way to heaven, the narrow way that leadeth to life. Hence CHRIST exhorts the church of Philadelphia to perſevere in holineſs from this conſideration, that it was neceſſary in order to her obtaining the crown. Rev. iii. 11. Hold faſt that which thou haſt, that no man take thy crown. It is neceſſary not only that perſons ſhould once have been walking in the way of duty; but that they ſhould be found ſo doing, when CHRIST cometh. Luke xii. 43. Bleſſed is that ſervant, whom is LORD, when he cometh, ſhall find ſo doing.—Holding out to the end is often made the condition of actual ſalvation. Mat. x. 22. <q>He that endureth to the end the ſame ſhall be ſaved:</q> and Rev. ii. 10. <q>Be thou faithful unto the death, and I will give thee a crown of life.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. IN order to your own perſeverance in the way of duty, your own care and watchfulneſs is neceſſary. For though it be promiſed that true ſaints ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, yet that is no argument that their care and watchfulneſs is not neceſſary in order to it; becauſe their care to keep the commands of GOD, is the thing promiſed. If the ſaints ſhould fail of care, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:016767_0132_0F9E178D9BAECAC0"/>
and diligence to perſevere in holineſs, that failure of their care and diligence would itſelf be a failure of holineſs. They who perſevere hot in watchfulneſs and diligence, perſevere not in holineſs of life, for holineſs of life very much conſiſts in watchfulneſs and diligence to keep the commands of GOD. It is one promiſe of the covenant of grace, that the ſaints ſhall keep GOD'S commandments. Ezek. xi. 19, 20.—Yet that is no argument that they have no need to take care to keep theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, or to do their duty. So the promiſe of GOD that the ſaints ſhall perſevere in holineſs is no argument that it is not neceſſary, that they ſhould take heed left they fall away.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE the ſcriptures abundantly warn men to watch over themſelves diligently, and to give earneſt heed leaſt they fall away. 1 Cor. xv. 13. Watch ye, ſtand faſt in the faith, quit you like men, be ſtrong. 1 Cor. x. 12. Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take heed leſt he fall. Heb. iii. 12, 13, 14. Take heed, brethren, leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living GOD; but exhort one another daily, while it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to day, leaſt any of you be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin. For we are made partakers of CHRIST, if we hold the begining of our confidence ſtedfaſt unto the end. Heb. iv. 1. Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore fear, leaſt a promiſe being left us of entering into his reſt, any of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it. 2. Pet. iii. 17. Ye therefore, beloved, ſeeing ye know theſe things before, beware leſt ye alſo being led away with the error of the wicked, fall from your own ſtedfaſtneſs. 2. Joh. v. 8. Look to yourſelves that we loſe not thoſe things, which we have wrought; but that we receive a full reward.</p>

               <pb n="137" facs="unknown:016767_0133_0F9E178DED19F5A0"/>
THUS you ſee how earneſtly the ſcriptures preſs on chriſtians exhortations to take diligent heed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that they fall not away. And certainly theſe cautions are not without reaſon.</p>
            <p>THE ſcriptures particularly in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>t upon watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in order to perſeverance in the duty of prayer. <hi>Watch and pray,</hi> ſaith CHRIST; which implies that we ſhould watch <hi>unto</hi> prayer, as the apoſtle Peter ſays 1. Pet. iv. 7. It implies that we ſhould watch againſt a neglect of prayer, as well as againſt other ſins. The apoſtle in places which have been already mentioned, directs us to pray with all prayer, <hi>watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> thereunto with all perſeverance, and to <hi>continue</hi> in prayer and <hi>watch</hi> in the ſame.—Nor is it any won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that the apoſtles ſo much inſiſted on watching in order to a continuance in prayer with all perſeverance; for there are many temptations to neglect this duty; firſt to be inconſtant in it, and from time to time to omit it; then in a great meaſure to neglect it. The devil watches by temptation to draw us away from GOD, and to hinder us from going to him in prayer. We are ſurrounded with one and another tempting object, buſineſs, and diverſion: particularly we meet with many things, which are great temptations to a neglect of this duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To move you to perſevere in the duty of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, conſider how much you always ſtand in need of the help of GOD. If perſons, who have formerly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this duty, leave it off, the language of it is, that now they ſtand in no further need of GOD'S help, that they have no further occaſion to go to GOD with requeſts and ſupplications: when indeed it is in GOD we live, and move and have our being. We cannot draw a breath without his help. You need his help every day for the ſupply of your outward wants; and
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:016767_0134_0F9E178EABDE4D08"/>
eſpecially you ſtand in continual need of him to help your ſouls. Without his protection they would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately fall into the hands of the devil, who always ſtands as a roaring lion, ready, whenever he is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, to fall upon the ſouls of men and devour them.—If GOD ſhould indeed preſerve your lives, but ſhould otherwiſe forſake and leave you to yourſelves, you would be moſt miſerable: your lives would be a curſe to you.</p>
            <p>THOSE that are converted, if GOD ſhould forſake them, would ſoon fall away totally from a ſtate of grace, into a ſtate far more miſerable than ever they were in before their converſion. They have no ſtrength of their own to reſiſt thoſe powerful enemies who ſurround them. Sin and ſatan would imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately carry them away, as a mighty flood, if GOD ſhould forſake them.—You ſtand in need of daily ſupplies from GOD. Without GOD you can receive no ſpiritual light nor comfort, can exerciſe no grace, can bring forth no fruit. Without GOD your ſouls will wither and pine away, and ſink into a moſt wretched ſtate. You continually need the inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and directions of GOD. What can a little child do in a vaſt, howling wilderneſs, without ſome one to guide it, and to lead it in the right way? Without GOD you will ſoon fall into ſnares, and pits, and many fatal calamities.</p>
            <p>SEEING therefore you ſtand in ſuch continual need of the help of GOD, how reaſonable is it that you ſhould continually ſeek it of him, and perſeveringly acknowledge your dependence upon him, by reſorting to him to ſpread your needs before him, and to off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> up your requeſts to him in prayer.—Let us conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how miſerable we ſhould be, if we ſhould leave off prayer, and GOD at the ſame time ſhould leave off
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:016767_0135_0F9E178F68621E98"/>
to take any care of us, or to afford us any more ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of his grace. By our conſtancy in prayer we cannot be profitable to GOD; and if we leave it off GOD will ſuſtain no damage: he doth not need our prayers. Job. xxxv. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 7.—But if GOD ceaſe to care for us and to help us, we immediately <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ink: we can do nothing: we can receive nothing without him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. CONSIDER the great benefit of a conſtant, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and perſevering attendance on this duty. It is one of the greateſt and moſt excellent means of nouriſhing the new nature, and of cauſing the ſoul to flouriſh and proſper. It is an excellent mean of keeping up an acquaintance with GOD, and of grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the knowledge of GOD. It is the way to a life of communion with GOD. It is an excellent mean of taking off the heart from the vanities of the world, and of cauſing the mind to be converſant in heaven. It is an excellent preſervative from ſin and the wiles of the devil, and a powerful antidote againſt the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the old ſerpent. It is a duty whereby ſtrength is derived from GOD againſt the luſts and corruptions of the heart, and the ſnares of the world.</p>
            <p>It hath a great tendency to keep the ſoul in a wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful frame, and to lead us to a ſtrict walk with GOD, and to a life that ſhall be fruitful in ſuch good works, as tend to adorn the doctrine of CHRIST, and to cauſe our light ſo to ſhine before others, that they ſeeing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ut good works ſhall glorify our father who is in heaven. And if the duty be conſtantly and diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended, it will be a very pleaſant duty. Slack and ſothful attendance upon it, and unſteadineſs in it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>re the cauſes which make it ſo great a burden as it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to ſome perſons: Their ſlothfulneſs in it hath na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally the effect to beget a diſlike of the duty and a
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:016767_0136_0F9E179071D00B70"/>
great indiſpoſition to it. But if it be conſtantly and diligently attended, it is one of the beſt means of lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not only a chriſtian and amiable, but alſo a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant life; a life of much ſweet fellowſhip with CHRIST, and of the abundant enjoyment of the light of his countenance.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, the great power which prayer, when duly attended, hath with GOD, is worthy of your notice. By it men become like Jacob, who as a prince had power with GOD and prevailed, when he wreſtled with GOD for the bleſſing. See the power of prayer repreſented in Jam. v. 16, 17, 18.—By theſe things you may be ſenſible how much you will loſe, if you ſhall be negligent of this great duty of calling upon GOD; and how ill you will conſult your own intereſt by ſuch a neglect.</p>
            <p>I CONCLUDE my diſcourſe with two directions in order to conſtancy and perſeverance in this duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WATCH againſt the beginnings of a neglect of this duty. Perſons who have for a time practiſed this duty, and afterwards neglect it, commonly leave it off by degrees. While their convictions and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious affections laſt, they are very conſtant in their cloſets, and no worldly buſineſs, or company, or diverſion hinders them. But as their convictions and affections begin to die away, they begin to find ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes to neglect it ſometimes. They are now ſo hurried; they have now ſuch and ſuch things to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to; or there are now ſuch inconveniencies in the way, that they perſuade themſelves, they may very excuſably omit it for this time. Afterwards it pretty frequently ſo happens, that they have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to hinder, ſomething which they call a juſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe. After a while a leſs thing becomes a ſufficient excuſe, than was allowed to be ſuch at firſt. Thus
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:016767_0137_0F9E1790E2FE0DB8"/>
the perſon by degrees contracts more and more of an habit of neglecting prayer, and becomes more and more indiſpoſed to it. And even when he doth perform it, it is in ſuch a poor, dull, heartleſs, miſerable manner, that he ſays to himſelf, he might as well not do it at all, as do it ſo. Thus he makes his own dulneſs and indiſpoſition an excuſe for wholly neglecting it, or at leaſt for living in a great meaſure in the neglect of it.—After this manner do ſatan and men's own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions inveigle them to their ruin.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE beware of the firſt beginnings of a neglect: Watch againſt temptations to it: Take heed how you begin to allow of excuſes. Be watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to keep up the duty in the height of it; let it not ſo much as begin to ſink. For when you give way, though it be but little, it is like giving way to an enemy in the field of battle; the firſt beginning of a retreat greatly encourages the enemy, and weakens the retreating ſoldiers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. LET me direct you to forſake all ſuch practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as you find by experience do indiſpoſe you to the duty of ſecret prayer. Examine the things in which you have allowed yourſelves, and inquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have had this effect. You are able to look over your paſt behaviour, and may doubtleſs, on an impartial conſideration, make a judgment of the practices and courſes in which you have allowed your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>PARTICULARLY let young people examine their manner of <hi>company keeping</hi> and the round of diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in which with their companions they have allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves. I only deſire that you would aſk at the mouth of your own conſciences, what has been the effect of theſe things with reſpect t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the duty of ſecret prayer. Have you not
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:016767_0138_0F9E17921C3F0C70"/>
found that ſuch practices have tended to the neglect of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s duty? Have you not found that after them you have been more indiſpoſed to it and leſs conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious and careful to attend it? Yea have they not from time to time, actually been the means of your neglecting it?</p>
            <p>IF you cannot deny that this is really the caſe, then if you ſeek the good of your ſouls, forſake theſe practices. Whatever you may plead for them, as that there is no hurt in them, or that there is a time for all things, and the like; yet if you find this hurt in the conſequence of them, it is time for you to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake them. And if you value heaven more than a little wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ly diverſion; if you ſet an higher price on eternal glory, than on a dance or a ſong, you will forſake them.</p>
            <p>IF th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe things be lawful in themſelves, yet if your experience ſhow, that they are attended with ſuch a conſequence as I have now mentioned, that is enough. It is lawful in itſelf fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But if by experience you find they cauſe you to offend; it is time for you to cut off the one, and pluck out the other, as you would ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther go to heaven without them, than go to hell with them, into that place of torment, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.</p>

            <p>IN the former part of this chapter we have a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful catalogue of the ſins of Jeruſalem; as you may ſee from the firſt to the thirteenth verſe. In the thirteenth which is the verſe preceeding the text, GOD manifeſts his great diſpleaſure, and fearful wrath againſt them for thoſe their iniquities. "Behold I have ſmitten mine hand at thy diſhoneſt gain which thou haſt made, and at thy blood which hath been in the midſt of thee" The expreſſion of GOD'S ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hand, ſignifies the greatneſs of his anger, and his preparing himſelf, as it were to execute wrath an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to their heinous crimes. It is an alluſion to what we ſometimes ſee in men when they are ſurpriz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſeeing or hearing of ſome horrid offence; or moſt
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:016767_0140_0F9E1794F89F8F48"/>
intolerable injury, which very much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> their ſpirits, and animates them with high reſentment; on ſuch an occaſion they will riſe up in wrath and ſmite their hands together, as an expreſſion of the heat of their indignation, and full reſolution to be avenged on thoſe who have committed the injury. As in chap. xxi. 17. <q>I will alſo ſmite mine hands together, and I will cauſe my fury to reſt: I the LORD have ſaid it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THEN in the text the puniſhment of that people is repreſented.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE nature of their puniſhment is more gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repreſented in that therein GOD will undertake to <hi>deal</hi> with them: GOD here threatens to deal with the ſinners in Jeruſalem. The prophets could do nothing with them. GOD had ſent them one after another; but thoſe ſinners were too ſtrong for them, and beat one and killed another. Therefore now GOD him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf undertakes to deal with them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THEIR puniſhment is more particularly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in three things, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the intolerableneſs, the remedileſſneſs, and the unavoidableneſs of it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1). THE intolerableneſs of it: <hi>can thine heart en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2). THE remedileſſneſs, or the impoſſibility of their doing any thing for their own relief: <hi>can thine hands be ſtrong?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">(3). THE unavoidableneſs of it: <hi>I the Lord have ſpoken it, and will do it.</hi>

            <div type="doctrine">
               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <p>SINCE GOD hath untertaken to deal with impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners, they ſhall neither ſhun the threatened miſery, nor deliver themſelves out of it, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:016767_0141_0F9E17960B2C7D28"/>
IN handling this doctrine, I ſhall 1. Show what is implied in GOD'S undertaking to deal with impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinners. 2. That therefore they cannot avoid puniſhment. 3. That they cannot in any meaſure deliver themſelves from it, or do any thing for their own relief under it. 4. That they cannot bear it. 5. I ſhall anſwer an inquiry; and then proceed to the uſe.</p>
               <p>I. I SHALL ſhow what is implied in GOD'S under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to deal with impenitent ſinners.—Others are not able to deal with them. They baffle all the means uſed with them by thoſe that are appointed to teach and to rule over them. They will not yield to parents; or to the counſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, warnings or reproofs of miniſters: they prove obſtinate and ſtiff-hearted. Therefore GOD undertakes to deal with them.—This implies the following things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THAT GOD will reckon with them, and take of them ſatisfaction to his juſtice. In this world GOD puts forth his authority to command them, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſubjection to him. In his commands he is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry poſitive, ſtrictly requiring of them the performance of ſuch and ſuch duties, and as poſitively forbidding ſuch and ſuch things which are contrary to their duty. But they have no regard to theſe commands. GOD continues commanding and they continue rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. They make nothing of GOD'S authority GOD threatens, but they deſpiſe his threatenings.—They make nothing of diſhonouring GOD: they care not how much their behaviour is to the diſhonour of GOD. He offers them mercy, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> they will repent and return: but they deſpiſe his mercy as well as his wrath. GOD calleth, but they refuſe—Thus they are continually plunging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves deeper and deeper in debt, and at the ſame time
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:016767_0142_0F9E179720063A18"/>
imagine they ſhall eſcape the payment of the debt, and deſign entirely to rob GOD of his due.</p>
               <p>BUT GOD hath undertaken to right himſelf. He will reckon with them; he hath undertaken to ſee that the debts due to him are paid. All their ſins are written in his book; not one of them is forgotten, and every one muſt be paid. If GOD be wiſe enough and ſtrong enough, he will have full ſatisfaction; he will exact the very uttermoſt farthing. He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes it as his part, as what belongs to him, to ſee himſelf righted, wherein he hath been wronged. Deut. xxxii. 35. "To me belongeth vengeance." ibid. vii. 10. <q>He will not be ſlack to him that hateth him; he will repay him to his face.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. HE hath undertaken to vindicate the honour of his majeſty. His majeſty they deſpiſe. They hear that he is a great GOD; but they deſpiſe his greatneſs; they look upon him worthy of contempt, and treat him accordingly. They hear of him by the name of a great king; but his authority they regard not and ſometimes trample upon it, for years together.</p>
               <p>BUT GOD hath not left the honour of his majeſty wholly to their care. Though they now trample it in the duſt, yet that is no ſign that it will finally be loſt. If GOD had left it wholly in their hands, it would indeed be loſt. But GOD doth not leave his honour and his glory with his enemies; it is too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in his eyes to be ſo neglected. He hath reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the care of it to himſelf: he will ſee to it that his own injured majeſty is vindicated. If the honour of GOD, upon which ſinners trample, finally lie in the duſt, then it will be becauſe he is not ſtrong enough to vindicate himſelf. He hath ſworn that great oath in Num. xiv. 21. <q>As truly as I live, all the earth ſhall be filled with the glory of the LORD.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="unknown:016767_0143_0F9E1797A4A8C7E8"/>
SINNERS deſpiſe his ſon and trample him under their feet. But he will ſee, if he cannot make the glory of his ſon appear, with reſpect to them; that all the earth may know how evil a thing it is to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe the Son of GOD.—GOD intends that all men and angels, all heaven and all earth ſhall ſee whether he be ſufficient to magnify himſelf upon ſinners, who now deſpiſe him. He intends that the iſſue of things, with reſpect to them, ſhall be open, that all men may ſee it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. HE hath undertaken to ſubdue impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Their hearts while in this world are very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubdued. They lift up their heads and conduct ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry proudly and contemptuouſly, and often ſin with an high hand. They ſet their mouths againſt the heavens, and their tongues walk through the earth. They practically ſay as Pharaoh did, <q>Who is the LORD? I know not the LORD, neither will I obey his voice.</q> Job. xxi. 41. <q>They ſay to GOD, depart from us, for we deſire not the knowledge of thy ways.</q>
               </p>
               <p>SOME, who cover their ſin with ſpecious ſhow; who put on a face of religion, and a demure counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and behaviour; yet have this ſpirit ſecretly reigning in their breaſts. Notwithſtanding all their fair ſhow, and good external carriage, they deſpiſe GOD in their hearts, and have the weapons of war about them; though they are ſecret enemies and carry their ſwords under their ſkirts. They have moſt proud, ſtubborn and rebellious hearts, which are ready to riſe in oppoſition, to contend with him, and to find fault with his diſpenſations. Their hearts are full of pride, enmity, ſtubbornneſs and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which work in them many ways, while they ſit under the preaching of the word, and while the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:016767_0144_0F9E179866C58598"/>
of GOD is ſtriving with them; and they always continue to oppoſe and reſiſt GOD, as long as they live in the world; they never lay down the weapons of their rebellion.</p>
               <p>BUT GOD hath undertaken to deal with them and to ſubdue them; and thoſe proud and ſtubborn hearts, which will not yield to the power of GOD'S word, ſhall be broken by the power of his hand.

He hath undertaken to make thoſe who are now regardleſs of GOD, regard him. They ſhall know that he is JEHOVAH. Now they will not own that he is the LORD; but they ſhall know it.

<pb n="149" facs="unknown:016767_0145_0F9E179925087BE8"/>
GOD tells them in his word. Miniſters take much pains to convince them, but all is in vain. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore GOD will undertake to convince them, and he will do it effectually.—Now they will not be convinced of the truth of divine things. They have indeed convincing arguments ſet before them; they hear and ſee enough to convince them; yet ſo prone are they to unbelief and atheiſm, that divine things never ſeem to them to be real. But GOD will hereafter make them ſeem real.</p>
               <p>Now they are always doubting of the truth of the ſcriptures, queſtioning whether they be the word of GOD, and whether the threatenings of ſcripture be true. But GOD hath undertaken to convince them that thoſe threatenings are true, and he will make them to know that they are true, ſo that they will never doubt any more for ever. They will be convinced by dear experience.—Now they are always queſtioning whether there be any ſuch place as hell. They hear much about it, but it always ſeems to them like a dream. But GOD will make it ſeem otherwiſe than a dream.—Now they are often told of the vanity of the world; but we may as well preach to the beaſts, to perſuade them of the vanity of earthly things. But GOD will undertake to convince them of this; he will hereafter give them a thorough conviction of it, ſo that they ſhall have a ſtrong ſenſe of the vanity of all theſe things.</p>
               <p>Now miniſters often tell ſinners of the great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of an intereſt in CHRIST, and that that is the one thing needful. They are alſo told the folly of delaying the care of their ſouls, and how much it concerns them to improve their opportunity. But the inſtructions of miniſters do not convince them, therefore GOD will undertake to convince them.</p>

IMPENITENT ſinners, while in this world, hear how dreadful hell is. But they will not believe that it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> dreadful, as miniſters repreſent. They cannot think that they ſhall to all eternity ſuffer ſuch exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and horrible torments. But they ſhall be taught and convinced to purpoſe, that the repreſentations miniſters give of thoſe torments agreeable to the word of GOD, are no bugbears; and that the wrath of GOD is indeed as dreadful as they declare.—Since GOD hath undertaken to deal with ſinners and to rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify their judgments in theſe matters, he will do it thoroughly; for his work is perfect; when he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to do things, he doth not do them by halves; therefore before he ſhall have done with ſinners, he will convince them effectually, ſo that they ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be in danger of relapſing into their former errors any more. He will convince them of their folly and ſtupidity in entertaining ſuch notions, as they now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain.</p>
               <p>THUS GOD hath undertaken to deal with obſtinate unbelievers.

There is no ſin, not ſo much as an idle word that they ſhall ſpeak, but they muſt give an account of it; Mat. xii. 36.—And their ſins muſt be fully balanced, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed, and ſatisfaction obtained.

I come now,</p>
               <p>II. To ſhow that therefore impenitent ſinners ſhall not avoid their due puniſhment.—GOD hath undertaken to inflict it; he hath engaged to do it; he takes it as his work, as what properly belongs to him, and we may expect it of him. If he hath ſworn by his life, that he will do it; and if he hath power ſufficient, if he is the living GOD, doubtleſs we ſhall ſee it done. And that GOD hath declared that he will puniſh impenitent ſinners, is manifeſt from many ſcriptures; as, Deut. xxxii. 41. <q>I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate me.</q> Deut. vii. 10. <q>He will not be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lack to him that hateth him: he will repay him to his face.</q> Exod. xxxiv. 7. <q>That will by no means clear the guilty.</q> Nahum i. 3. <q>The LORD is ſlow to anger, and great in power, and will not at all acquit the wicked.</q>
               </p>
               <p>GOD ſaith in the text, <q>I the LORD have ſpoken it, and will do it;</q> which leaves no room to doubt of the actual fulfilment of the threatening in its utmoſt extent.—Some wicked men have flattered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that although GOD hath threatened very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful things to wicked men for their ſins, yet in his heart he never intends to fulfil his threatenings, but only to terrify them, and make them afraid, while they live. But would the infinitely holy GOD, who is not a man that he ſhould lie, and who ſpeaketh no vain words, utter himſelf in this manner, <hi>I the Lord have ſpoken it, and will do it; I have not only threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened, but I will alſo fulfil my threatenings;</hi> when at the ſame time theſe words did not agree with his heart, but he ſecretly knew that though he had ſpoken, yet he intended not to do it? Who is he that dares to entertain ſuch horrid blaſphemy in his heart?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="unknown:016767_0148_0F9E179C227C5A98"/>
No; let no impenitent ſinner flatter himſelf ſo vainly and fooliſhly. If it were indeed only a man, a being of like impotency and mutability with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who had undertaken to deal with them; they might perhaps with ſome reaſon flatter themſelves, that they ſhould find ſome means to avoid the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened puniſhment. But ſince an omniſcient, omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, immutable GOD hath undertaken, vain are all ſuch hopes.</p>
               <p>THERE is no hope that poſſibly they may ſteal away to heaven, though they die unconverted. There is no hope that they can deceive GOD by any falſe ſhow of repentance and faith, and ſo be taken to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven through miſtake: for the eyes of GOD are as a flame of fire; they perfectly ſee through every man; the inmoſt cloſet of the heart is all open to him.</p>
               <p>THERE is no hope of eſcaping the threatened pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment by ſinking into nothing at death, like brute creatures. Indeed many wicked men upon their death-beds wiſh for this. If it were ſo, death would be nothing to them in compariſon with what it now is. But all ſuch wiſhes are vain.</p>
               <p>THERE is no hope of their eſcaping without no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, when they leave the body. There is no hope that GOD by reaſon of the multiplicity of affairs, which he hath to mind, will happen to overlook them, and not take notice of them, when they come to die; and ſo that their ſouls will ſlip away pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately, and hide themſelves in ſome ſecret corner, and ſo eſcape divine vengeance.</p>
               <p>THERE is no hope that they ſhall be miſſed in a crowd, at the day of judgment, and that they can have opportunity to hide themſelves in ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="153" facs="unknown:016767_0149_0F9E179FB40B5D40"/>
by reaſon of the many things, which will be the objects of attention on that day,—Neither is there any hope that they will be able to croud themſelves in among the multitude of the ſaints at the right hand of the judge, and ſo go to heaven undiſcovered.—Nor is there any hope that GOD will alter his mind, or that he will repent of what he hath ſaid; for he is not the ſon of man that he ſhould repent. Hath he ſaid, and ſhall he not do it? Hath he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and ſhall he not make it good? When did GOD ever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to do any thing and fail? I come now,</p>
               <p>III. To ſhow that as impenitent ſinners cannot ſhun the threatened puniſhment; ſo neither can they do any thing to deliver themſelves from it, or to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve themſelves under it. This is implied in thoſe words of the text, <hi>Can thine hands be ſtrong?</hi> It is with our hands that we make and accompliſh things for ourſelves. But the wicked in hell will have no ſtrength of hand to accompliſh any thing at all for themſelves, or to bring to paſs any deliverance, or any degree of relief.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THEY will not be able in that conflict to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their enemy, and ſo to deliver themſelves. GOD, who will then undertake to deal with them, and will gird himſelf with might to execute wrath, will be their enemy, and will act the part of an enemy with a witneſs; and they will have no ſtrength to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe, who live negligent of their ſoul under the light of the goſpel, act as if they ſuppoſed that they ſhould be able hereafter to make their part good with GOD. 1 Cor. x. 22. <q>Do we provoke the LORD to jealouſy? are we ſtronger than he?</q>—But they will have no power, no might to reſiſt that om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotence, which will be engaged againſt them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THEY will have no ſtrength in their hands to

do any thing to appeaſe GOD, or in the leaſt to abate the fierceneſs of his wrath. They will not be able to offer any ſatisfaction: they will not be able to procure GOD'S pity. Though they cry, GOD will not hear them. They will find no price to offer to GOD, in order to purchaſe any favour, or to pay any part of their debt.</p>

They will have no friend in <hi>bell:</hi> all there will be their enemies. They will have no friend in heaven: none of the ſaints or an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels will befriend them: or if they ſhould, it would be to no purpoſe. There will be no creature that will have any power to deliver them, nor will any ever pity them.</p>
               <p n="4">4. NOR will they ever be able to make their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape. They will find no means to break priſon and flee. In hell they will be reſerved in chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for ever and ever. Malefactors have often found means to break priſon, and eſcape the hand of civil juſtice. But none ever eſcaped out of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of hell, which is GOD'S priſon. It is a ſtrong priſon: it is beyond any finite power, or the united ſtrength of all wicked men and devils, to unlock, or break open the door of that priſon. CHRIST hath the key of hell; "he ſhuts and no man opens."</p>
               <p n="5">5. NOR will they ever be able to find any thing to relieve them in hell. They will never find any reſting place there; any place of reſpite; any ſecret corner, which will be cooler than the reſt, where they may have a little reſpite, a ſmall abatement of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of their torment.—They never will be able
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:016767_0151_0F9E17A170938FE8"/>
to find any cooling ſtream or fountain, in any part of that world of torment; no, nor ſo much as a drop of water to cool their tongues.—They will find no company to give them any comfort, or to do them the leaſt good. They will find no place, where they can remain, and reſt, and take breath for one minute: for they will be tormented with fire and brimſtone; and will have no reſt day nor night for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>THUS impenitent ſinners will be able neither to ſhun the puniſhment threatened, nor to deliver them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from it, nor to find any relief under it.</p>

            <p>HAVING ſhown that impenitent ſinners will here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be able neither to avoid the puniſhment threatened, nor to deliver themſelves from it, nor to find any relief under it; I come now,</p>
            <p>IV. To ſhow, that neither will they be able to bear it. Neither will their hands be ſtrong to deliver themſelves from it, nor will their hearts be able to endure it. It is common with men, when they meet with calamities in this world, in the firſt place to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſhun them. But if they find, that they cannot ſhun them; then after they are come, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to deliver themſelves from them, as ſoon as they can; or at leaſt to order things ſo, as to deliver themſelves in ſome degree. But if they find that they can by no means deliver themſelves, and ſee that the caſe is ſo that they muſt bear them; then they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="157" facs="unknown:016767_0153_0F9E17A2E71D7938"/>
themſelves to bear them: they fortify their ſpirits, and take up a reſolution, that they will ſupport themſelves under them, as well as they can. They clothe themſelves with all the reſolution and courage they are maſters of, to keep their ſpirits from ſinking under their calamities.</p>
            <p>BUT it will be utterly in vain for impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, to think to do thus, with reſpect to the torments of hell. They will not be able to endure them, or at all to ſupport themſelves under them: the torment will be immenſely beyond their ſtrength. What will it ſignify for a worm, which is about to be preſſed under the weight of ſome great rock, to be let fall with its whole weight upon it, to collect its ſtrength, to ſet itſelf to bear up the weight of the rock, and to preſerve itſelf from being cruſhed by it?—Much more in vain will it be for a poor damned ſoul, to endeavour to ſupport itſelf, under the weight of the wrath of Almighty GOD. What is the ſtrength of man, who is b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t a worm, to ſupport himſelf againſt the power of Jehovah, and againſt the fierceneſs of his wrath? What is man's ſtrength, when ſet to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>WHEN ſinners hear of hell-torments, they ſometimes think with themſelves; Well, if it ſhall come to that, that I muſt go to hell, I will bear it as well as I can: as if by cloathing themſelves with reſolution and firmneſs of mind, they would be able to ſupport themſelves in ſome meaſure: when alas! they will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ave no reſolution, no courage at all. However they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> all have prepared themſelves, and collected their ſtrength; yet as ſoon as they ſhall begin to feel that
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:016767_0154_0F9E17A3C36AF830"/>
wrath, their hearts will melt and be as water. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever before they may ſeem to harden their hearts, in order to prepare themſelves to bear, yet the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they feel it, their hearts will become like wax before the furnace. Their courage and reſolution will be all gone in an inſtant; it will vaniſh away like a ſhadow in the twinkling of an eye. The ſtout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and moſt ſturdy will have no more courage than the feebleſt infant: let a man be an infant, or a giant, it will be all one. They will not be able to keep alive any courage, any ſtrength, any comfort, any hope at all.—I come now as was propoſed,</p>
            <p>V. To anſwer an enquiry which may naturally be raiſed concerning theſe things.</p>
            <p>ENQ. SOME may be ready to ſay, if this be the caſe, if impenitent ſinners can neither ſhun future puniſhment, nor deliver themſelves from it, nor bear it; then what will become of them?</p>
            <p>ANSW. THEY will wholly ſink down into eternal death. There will be that ſinking of heart, of which we now cannot conceive. We ſee how it is with the body, when in extreme pain. The nature of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy will ſupport itſelf for a conſiderable time, under very great pain, ſo as to keep from wholly ſinking. There will be great ſtruggles, lamentable groans and panting, and it may be convulſions. Theſe are the ſtrugglings of nature to ſupport itſelf under the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the pain. There is, as it were, a great loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in nature to yield to it; it cannot bear wholly to ſink.</p>
            <p>BUT yet ſometimes pain of body is ſo very extreme and exquiſite, that the nature of the body cannot ſupport itſelf under it; however loath it may be to ſink, yet it cannot bear the pain; there are a few ſtruggles and throws and pantings, and it may be a
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:016767_0155_0F9E17A4D756DA80"/>
ſhriek or two, and then nature yields to the violence of the torments, ſinks down, and the body dies. This is the death of the body. So it will be with the ſoul in hell; it will have no ſtrength or power to deliver itſelf, and it's torment and horror will be ſo great, ſo mighty, ſo vaſtly diſproportioned to its ſtrength, that having no ſtrength in the leaſt to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port itſelf, although it be infinitely contrary to the nature and inclination of the ſoul utterly to ſink; yet it will ſink, it will utterly and totally ſink, without the leaſt degree of remaining comfort, or ſtrength, or courage, or hope. And though it will never be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated, its being and perception will never be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; yet ſuch will be the infinite depth of gloomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that it will ſink into, that it will be in a ſtate of death, eternal death.</p>
            <p>THE nature of man deſires happineſs; it is the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſoul to crave and thirſt after well being: and if it be under miſery, it eagerly pants after relief; and the greater the miſery is, the more eagerly doth it ſtruggle for help. But if all relief be withhold<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> all ſtrength overborn, all ſupport utterly gone; then it ſinks into the darkneſs of death.</p>
            <p>WE can conceive but little of the matter; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceive what that ſinking of the ſoul, in ſuch a caſe, is. But to help your conception, imagine your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be caſt into a fiery oven, all of a glowing heat, or into the midſt of a glowing brick-kiln, or of a great furnace, where your pain would be as much greater than that occaſioned by accidentally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

And how much greater would be the effect, if you knew you muſt endure it for a whole year; and how vaſtly greater ſtill, if you knew you muſt endure it for a thouſand years!—O then how would your heart ſink, if you thought, if you knew, that you muſt bear it for ever and ever! that there would be no end! that after millions of millions of ages, your torment would be no nearer to an end, than ever it was; and that you never, never ſhould be delivered!</p>
            <p>BUT your torment in hell will be immenſely greater than this illuſtration repreſents. How then will the heart of a poor creature ſink under it! How utterly inexpreſſible and inconceivable muſt the ſinking of the ſoul be in ſuch a caſe!</p>
            <p>THIS is the death threatened in the law. This is dying in the higheſt ſenſe of the word. This is to die ſenſibly; to die and know it; to be ſenſible of the gloom of death. This is to be undone; this is worthy of the name of deſtruction. This ſinking of the ſoul under an infinite weight, which it cannot bear, is the gloom of hell. We read in ſcripture of the blackneſs of darkneſs; this is it, this is the very thing.—We read in ſcripture of ſinners being loſt and of their loſing their ſouls: this is the thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; this is to loſe the ſoul: they that are the ſubjects of this, are utterly loſt.</p>

If thou will not be convinced by the word preached to thee by men, in the name of GOD; GOD himſelf will undertake to convince thee. Ezek. xiv. 4, 7, 8.</p>

The reaſon is, that thou loveſt thy wickedneſs; thy wickedneſs ſeems good to thee; it appears lovely to thee; thou doſt not ſee any hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in it, or to be ſure, any ſuch hatefulneſs as to anſwer ſuch miſery.</p>
               <p>BUT know, thou ſtupid, blind, hardened wretch, that GOD doth not ſee, as thou ſeeſt with thy pollut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eyes: thy ſins in his ſight are infinitely abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.—Thou knoweſt that thou haſt a thouſand and a thouſand times, made light of the majeſty of GOD. And why ſhould not that majeſty, which thou haſt thus deſpiſed, be manifeſted in the greatneſs of thy puniſhment? Thou haſt often heard what a great and dreadful GOD Jehovah is: but thou haſt made ſo light of it, that thou haſt not been afraid of him, thou haſt not been afraid to ſin againſt him, nor to go on day after day, by thy ſins, to provoke him to wrath, nor to caſt his commands under foot, and trample on them. Now why may not GOD, in the greatneſs of thy deſtruction, juſtly vindicate and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the greatneſs of that majeſty, which thou haſt deſpiſed?</p>
               <p>THOU haſt deſpiſed the mighty power of GOD; thou haſt not been afraid of it. Now why is it not fit, that GOD ſhould ſhow the greatneſs of his power in thy ruin.

IT ariſes from thy fooliſh ſtupidity and ſenſeleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and is becauſe thou haſt an heart of ſtone, that thou art ſo ſenſeleſs of thine own wickedneſs, as to think that thou haſt not deſerved ſuch a puniſhment, and that it is to thee incredible that it will be inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon thee.—But if, when all is ſaid and done, thou be not convinced, wait but a little while, and thou wilt be convinced: GOD will undertake to do the work which miniſters cannot do.—Though judgment againſt thine evil works be not yet execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and GOD now let thee alone; yet he will ſoon come upon thee with his great power, and then thou ſhalt know what GOD is, and what thou art.</p>
               <p>FLATTER not thyſelf, that if theſe things ſhall prove true, and the worſt ſhall come, thou wilt ſet thy ſelf to bear it as well as thou canſt. What will it ſignify, to ſet thyſelf to bear, and to collect thy ſtrength to ſupport thyſelf, when thou ſhalt fall into the hands of that omnipotent king, Jehovah? He that made thee, can make his ſword approach unto thee. His ſword is not the ſword of man, nor is his wrath the wrath of man. If it were, poſſibly ſtoutneſs might be maintained under it. But it is the fierceneſs of the wrath of the great GOD, who is able to baffle and diſſipate all thy ſtrength in a moment. He can fill thy poor ſoul with an ocean of wrath, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge of fire and brimſtone; or he can make it ten thouſand times fuller of torment, than ever an oven was full of fire; and at the ſame time can fill it with deſpair of ever ſeeing any end to its torment, or any reſt from its miſery and then where will be thy ſtrength? what will become of thy courage then? what will ſignify thine attempts to bear?</p>

But how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle are they in the hands of the great GOD! they are leſs than weak infants; they are nothing, and leſs than nothing in the hands of an angry GOD, as will appear at the day of judgment.—Their hearts will be broken; they will ſink; they will have no ſtrength nor courage left; they will be as weak as water; their ſouls will ſink down into an infinite gloom, and abyſs of death and deſpair.—Then what will become of thee, a poor worm, when thou ſhalt fall into the hands of that GOD, what he ſhall come to ſhow his wrath, and make his power known on thee?</p>
               <p>IF the ſtrength of all the wicked men on earth, and of all the devils in hell, were united in one, and thou wert poſſeſſed of it all; and if the courage, great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtoutneſs of all their hearts were united in thy ſingle heart, thou wouldeſt be nothing in the hands of JEHOVAH. If it were all collected, and thou ſhouldeſt ſet thyſelf to bear as well as thou couldeſt, all would ſink under his great wrath in an inſtant, and would be utterly aboliſhed: thine hands would drop down at once and thine heart would melt as wax.—The great mountains, the firm rocks cannot ſtand before the power of GOD; as faſt as they ſtand, they are toſſed hither and thither, and ſkip like lambs, when GOD appears in his anger. He can tear the earth in pieces in a moment; yea he can ſhatter the whole univerſe, and daſh it to pieces at one blow.

How then will thine hands be ſtrong, or thine heart endure!</p>
               <p>THOU canſt not ſtand before a lion of the foreſt; an angry wild beaſt, if ſtirred up, will eaſily tear ſuch an one, as thou art in pieces. Yea not only ſo, but thou art cruſhed before the moth. A little thing, a little worm or ſpider, or ſome ſuch inſect, is able to kill thee. What then canſt thou do in the hands of GOD. It is vain to ſet the briers and thorns in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle array againſt glowing flames; the points of thorns, though ſharp, do nothing to withſtand the fire.</p>
               <p>SOME of you have ſeen buildings on fire; imagine therefore with yourſelves, what a poor hand you would make at fighting with the flames, if you were in the midſt of ſo great and fierce a fire. You have often ſeen a ſpider, or ſome other noiſome inſect, when thrown into the midſt of a fierce fire, and have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved how immediately it yields to the force of the flames. There is no long ſtruggle, no fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the fire, no ſtrength exerted to oppoſe the heat, or to fly from it; but it immediately ſtretches forth itſelf, and yields; and the fire takes poſſeſſion of it, and at once it becomes full of fire, and is burned into a bright coal.—Here is a little image of what you will be the ſubjects of in hell, except you repent and fly to CHRIST. However you may think, that you will fortify yourſelves, and bear as well as you can; the firſt moment you ſhall be caſt into hell, all your ſtrength will ſink and be utterly aboliſhed. To en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage yourſelves that you will ſet yourſelves to bear hell-torments as well as you can, is juſt as if a worm, that is about to be thrown into a glowing furnace, ſhould ſwell and fortify itſelf, and prepare itſelf to fight the flames.</p>
               <p>WHAT can you do with lightenings? What doth

it ſignify to fight with them? What an abſurd figure would a poor, weak man make, who in a thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorm ſhould expect a flaſh of lightening on his head or his breaſt, and ſhould go forth ſword in hand to oppoſe it; when a ſtream of brimſtone would, in an inſtant, drink up all his ſpirits and his life, and melt his ſword!</p>
               <p>CONSIDER theſe things, all you enemies of GOD, and rejectors of CHRIST, whether you be old men and women, Chriſtleſs heads of families, or young people and wicked children. Be aſſured that if you do not hearken and repent, GOD intends to ſhow his wrath, and make his power known upon you. He intends to magnify himſelf exceedingly in ſinking you down in hell. He intends to ſhow his great majeſty, at the day of judgment, before a vaſt aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in your miſery; before a greater aſſembly many thouſand fold, than ever yet appeared on earth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a vaſt aſſembly of ſaints, and a vaſt aſſembly of wicked men, a vaſt aſſembly of holy angels, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the crew of devils. GOD will before all theſe get himſelf honor in your deſtruction; you ſhall be tormented in the preſence of them all.—Then all will ſee that God is a great GOD indeed; then all will ſee how dreadful a thing it is to ſin againſt ſuch a GOD, and to reject ſuch a Saviour, ſuch love and grace, as you have rejected and deſpiſed. All will be filled with awe at the great ſight, and all the ſaints and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels will look upon you, and adore that majeſty, and that mighty power, and that holineſs and juſtice of GOD, which ſhall appear in your ineffable deſtruction and miſery.</p>
               <p>IT is probable that here are ſome, who hear me this day, who at this very moment are unawakened, and are in a great degree careleſs about their ſouls.

I fear there are ſome among us, who are moſt fear, fully hardened; their hearts are harder than the very rocks. It is eaſier to make impreſſions upon an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, than upon their hearts. I ſuppoſe ſome of you have heard all that I have ſaid with caſe and quietneſs: it appears to you as great, big, ſounding words, but doth not reach your hearts. You have heard ſuch things many times: You are old ſoldiers, and have been too much uſed to the roaring of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's cannon, to be frighted at it. It will therefore probably be in vain for me to ſay any thing further to you; I will only put you in mind that ere long GOD will deal with you. I cannot deal with you; you deſpiſe what I ſay; I have no power to make you ſenſible of your danger and miſery, and of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of the wrath of GOD. The attempts of men in this way have often proved vain.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER GOD hath undertaken to deal with ſuch men as you are. It is his manner commonly firſt to let men try their utmoſt ſtrength; particularly to let miniſters try, that thus he may ſhow miniſters their own weakneſs and impotency. And when they have done what they can, and all fails; then GOD takes the matter into his own hands.—So it ſeems by your obſtinacy, as if GOD intended to undertake to deal with you. He will undertake to ſubdue you; he will ſee, if he cannot cure you of your ſenſeleſſneſs and regardleſſneſs of his threatenings. And you will be convinced; you will be ſubdued effectually; your hearts will be broken with a witneſs; your ſtrength will be utterly broken, your courage and hope will ſink. GOD will ſurely break thoſe, who will not bow.—GOD, having girded himſelf with his power and wrath, hath heretofore undertaken to deal with many hard, ſtubborn, ſenſeleſs, obſtinate hearts; and he
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:016767_0165_0F9E17AEF6C3E1D8"/>
never failed, he always did his work thoroughly.</p>

            <p>THIS is the ſum of the objections uſually made againſt this doctrine, that it is inconſiſtent with the juſtice, and eſpecially with the <hi>mercy</hi> of GOD. And ſome ſay, If it be ſtrictly <hi>juſt,</hi> yet how can we ſuppoſe that a merciful GOD can bear eternally to torment his creatures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THEN I ſhall briefly ſhow that it is not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the juſtice of GOD to inflict an eternal puniſhment. To evince this, I ſhall uſe only one ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that ſin is heinous enough to deſerve ſuch a puniſhment, and ſuch a puniſhment is no more than proportionable to the evil or d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>merit of ſin. If the evil of ſin be infinite, as the puniſhment is, then it is manifeſt that the puniſhment is no more than proportionable to the ſin puniſhed, and is no more than ſin deſerves. And if the obligation to love, honor and obey GOD be infinite, then ſin which is the violation of this obligation, is a violation of infinite obligation, and ſo is an infinite evil. Again, if GOD be infinitely worthy of love, honor and obedience, then our obligation to love and honor and obey him is infinitely great.—So that GOD being infinitely glorious, or infinitely worthy of our love, honor and obedience; our obligation to love, honor and obey
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:016767_0169_0F9E17B1F8F089C0"/>
him, and ſo to avoid all ſin is infinitely great. Again, our obligation to love, honor and obey GOD being infinitely great, ſin is the violation of infinite obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo is an infinite evil. Once more, ſin being an infinite evil, deſerves an infinite puniſhment, an infinite puniſhment is no more than it deſerves: Therefore ſuch puniſhment is juſt; which was the thing to be proved.—There is no evading the force of this reaſoning, but by denying that GOD, the ſovereign of the univerſe, is infinitely glorious; which I preſume none of my hearers will adventure to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I AM to ſhow that it is not inconſiſtent with the <hi>mercy</hi> of GOD to inflict an eternal puniſhment on wicked men. It is an unreaſonable and unſcriptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral notion of the mercy of GOD, that he is merciful in ſuch a ſenſe, that he cannot bear that penal juſtice ſhould be execut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>. This is to conceive of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD as a paſſion to which his nature is ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, that GOD is liable to be moved, and affected, and overcome by ſeeing a creature in miſery, ſo that he cannot bear to ſee juſtice executed: which is a moſt unworthy and abſurd notion of the mercy of GOD, and would, if true, argue great weakneſs.—It would be a great defect and not a perfection in the ſovereign and ſupreme judge of the world, to be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful in ſuch a ſenſe, that he could not bear to have penal juſtice executed. It is a very unſcriptural no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mercy of GOD. The ſcriptures every where repreſent the mercy of GOD as free and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, and not that the exerciſes of it are neceſſary, ſo that GOD cannot bear juſtice ſhould take place. The ſcriptures abundantly ſpeak of it as the glory of the divine attribute of <hi>mercy,</hi> that it is free and ſovereign <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> its exerciſes; and not that it is ſo, that GOD cannot

<pb n="174" facs="unknown:016767_0170_0F9E17B4A334F468"/>
help but deliver ſinners from miſery. This is a mean and moſt unworthy idea of the divine mercy.</p>
            <p>IT is moſt abſurd alſo as it is contrary to plain fact. For if there be any meaning in the objection, this is ſuppoſed in it, that all miſery of the creature, whether juſt or unjuſt, is in itſelf contrary to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of GOD. For if his mercy be of ſuch a nature, that a very great degree of miſery, though juſt, is contrary to his nature: then it is only to add to the mercy, and then a leſs degree of miſery is contrary to his nature; again to add further to it, and a ſtill leſs degree of miſery is contrary to his nature. And ſo the mercy of GOD being infinite, all miſery muſt be contrary to his nature; which we ſee to be contrary to fact: for we ſee that GOD in his providence, doth indeed inflict very great calamities on mankind even in this life.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER ſtrong ſuch kind of objections againſt the eternal miſery of the wicked, may ſeem to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, ſenſeleſs hearts of men, as though it were againſt GOD'S juſtice and mercy; yet their ſeeming ſtrength, and its ſeeming to be incredible that GOD ſhould give over any of his creatures to ſuch a dreadful calamity as eternal, helpleſs miſery and torment, altogether ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from a want of a ſenſe of the infinite evil, odiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and provocation, that there is in ſin. Hence it ſeems to us not ſuitable that any poor creature ſhould be the ſubject of ſuch miſery, becauſe we have no ſenſe of any thing abominable and provoking in any creature anſwerable to it. If we had, then this infinite calamity would not ſeem unſuitable. For one thing would but appear anſwerable and proportionable to another, and ſo the mind would reſt in it as fit and ſuitable, and no more than what is proper to be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered by the juſt, holy and good governor of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="175" facs="unknown:016767_0171_0F9E17B5B3B9ED98"/>
THAT this is ſo, we may be convinced by this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, <abbr>viz.</abbr> that when we hear or read, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we do, of very horrid things committed by ſome men, as for inſtance, ſome horrid inſtance of cruelty, it may be to ſome poor innocent child, or ſome holy martyr; when we read or hear how ſuch and ſuch perſons delighted themſelves in torturing them with lingering torments; what terrible diſtreſs the poor, innocent creatures were in, under their hands, for many days together; and their cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, having no regard to their ſhrieks and cries, only ſported themſelves with their miſery, and would not ſafe even to put an end to their lives:—I ſay, when we hear or read of ſuch things, we have a ſenſe of the evil of them, and they make a deep impreſſion on our minds. Hence it ſeems juſt, and not only ſo, but every way fit and ſuitable that GOD ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a very terrible puniſhment on perſons who have perpetuated ſuch wickedneſs: It ſeems, no way diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to any perfection of the judge of the world; we can think of it without being at all ſhocked. The reaſon is, that we have a ſenſe of the evil of their conduct, and a ſenſe of the proportion there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the evil or demerit of their conduct and the puniſhment.</p>
            <p>JUST ſo if we ſaw a proportion between the evil of ſin and eternal puniſhment, if we ſaw ſomething in wicked men that ſhould appear as hateful to us, as eternal miſery appears dreadful; ſomething that ſhould as much ſtir up indignation and deteſtation, as eternal miſery does terror; all objections againſt this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine would vaniſh at once. Though now it ſeem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible; though when we hear of it and are ſo often <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>old of it, we know not how to realize it; though <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hen we hear of ſuch a degree and duration of tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:016767_0172_0F9E17B7432A1AB8"/>
as are held forth in this doctrine, and think what eternity is, it is ready to ſeem impoſſible, that ſuch torments ſhould be inflicted on poor, feeble crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, by a creator of infinite mercy: yet this ariſes principally from theſe two cauſes, (1.) That it is ſo contrary to the depraved inclinations of mankind, they are ſo averſe to the truth of this doctrine, they hate to believe it, and cannot bear it ſhould be true. (2.) That they ſee not the ſuitableneſs of eternal puniſhment to the evil of ſin; they ſee not that eternal puniſhment is proportionable and no more than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to the demerit of ſin.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus ſhown that the eternal puniſhment of the wicked is not inconſiſtent with the divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, I ſhall now proceed further, and undertake to ſhow that it is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with the divine perfections, that thoſe perfections evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly require it; i. e. they require that ſin ſhould have ſo great a puniſhment, either in the perſon who has committed it, or in a ſurety; and therefore with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to thoſe who believe not in the ſurety, and have no intereſt in him, the divine perfections require that this puniſhment ſhould be inflicted on them.</p>
            <p>THIS appears, as it is not only not unſuitable, that ſin ſhould be thus puniſhed; but it is poſitively ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, decent and proper.—If this be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that it is poſitively ſuitable, that ſin ſhould be thus puniſhed, then it will follow, that the perfections of GOD require it; for certainly the perfections of GOD require that that ſhould be done, which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be done. The perfection, and excellency of the nature of GOD require, that that ſhould take place which is perfect, excellent and proper in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But that ſin ſhould be puniſhed eternally is ſuch a thing; which appears by the following conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="177" facs="unknown:016767_0173_0F9E17B7E8BFC728"/>
1. IT is ſuitable that GOD ſhould infinitely hate ſin, and be an infinite enemy to it. Sin, as I have before ſhown, is an infinite evil, and therefore is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely odious and deteſtable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is proper that GOD ſhould hate every evil, and hate it according to its odious and deteſtable nature. And ſin being infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evil and odious, it is proper that GOD ſhould hate it infinitely.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF infinite hatred of ſin be ſuitable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine character, then the expreſſions of ſuch hatred are alſo ſuitable to his character. If it be ſuitable that GOD ſhould hate ſin, then it is ſuitable he ſhould expreſs that hatred. Becauſe that which is ſuitable to be, is ſuitable to be expreſſed: that which is love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in itſelf, is lovely when it appears. If it be ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table that GOD ſhould be an infinite enemy to ſin, or that he ſhould hate it infinitely, then it is ſuitable that he ſhould act as ſuch an enemy. No poſſible reaſon can be given why it is not ſuitable for GOD to <hi>act</hi> as ſuch an one, as it is ſuitable for him to <hi>be.</hi> If it be ſuitable that he ſhould hate and have enmity againſt ſin, then it is ſuitable for him to expreſs that hatred and enmity, in that to which hatred and enmity by its own nature tends.—But certainly hatred in its own nature tends to oppoſition, and to ſet itſelf againſt that which is hated, and to procure its evil and not its good: and that in proportion to the hatred. Great hatred naturally tends to the great evil, and infinite hatred to the infinite evil, of its object.</p>
            <p>WHENCE it follows, that if it be ſuitable that there ſhould be infinite hatred of ſin in GOD, as I have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>own it is, it is ſuitable that he ſhould execute an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite puniſhment on it; and ſo the perfections of GOD require that he ſhould puniſh ſin with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> or which is the ſame thing, with an eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="178" facs="unknown:016767_0174_0F9E17B8A9C99220"/>
THUS we ſee not only the great objection againſt this doctrine anſwered, but the truth of the doctrine eſtabliſhed by reaſon.—I now proceed further to eſtabliſh it, by conſidering the remaining particulars under the doctrine.</p>
            <p>II. THAT eternal death or puniſhment, which GOD threatens to the wicked, is not annihilation, but an abiding, ſenſible puniſhment or miſery.</p>
            <p>THE truth of this propoſition will appear by the following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE ſcripture every where repreſents the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the wicked, as implying very extreme pains and ſufferings; but a ſtate of annihilation is no ſtate of ſuffering at all. Perſons annihilated have no ſenſe or feeling of pain or pleaſure, and much leſs do they feel that puniſhment which carries in it an <hi>extreme</hi> pain or ſuffering.—They no more ſuffer to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, than they did ſuffer from eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT is agreeable both to ſcripture and reaſon, to ſuppoſe, that the wicked will be puniſhed in ſuch a manner, that they ſhall be ſenſible of the puniſhment they are under; that they ſhould be ſenſible, that now GOD has executed and fulfilled what he threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened, and which they diſregarded, and would not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; that they ſhould know themſelves, that juſtice takes place upon them; that they ſhould ſee and find, that GOD vindicates that majeſty which they deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that they ſhould ſee that GOD is not ſo deſpica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a being as they thought him to be; that they ſhould be ſenſible, for what they are puniſhed, while they are under the threatened puniſhment; that they ſhould be ſenſible of their own guilt, and ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member their former opportunities and obligations, and ſhould ſee their own folly and GOD'S juſtice.—If the eternal puniſhment threatened be eternal anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilation,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:016767_0175_0F9E17B9B3C5F7A0"/>
when it is inflicted, they will never know that it is inflicted; they will never know that GOD is juſt in their puniſhment, or that they have their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. And how is this agreeable to the ſcripture, in which GOD threatens that he will repay the wicked <hi>to his face,</hi> Deut. vii. 10? And to that in Job xxi. 19, 20. Speaking there of GOD'S puniſhing wicked men, it is ſaid, <q>GOD rewardeth him and he ſhall know it; his eyes ſhall ſee his deſtruction, and he ſhall drink of the wrath of the Almighty</q>? And to that in Ezekiel xxii. 21, 22. <q>Yea I will gather you, and blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye ſhall be melted in the midſt thereof, as ſilver is melted in the midſt of the furnace, ſo ſhall ye be melted in the midſt thereof; and ye ſhall <hi>know</hi> that I the LORD have poured out my fury upon you</q>?—And how it is agreeable to that expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſo often annexed to the threatenings of GOD'S wrath againſt wicked men, <hi>And ye ſhall know that I am the Lord?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. THE ſcripture teaches that the wicked will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer different degrees of torment, according to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent aggravations of their ſins. Mat. v. 22. <q>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is angry with his brother without a cauſe ſhall be in danger of the judgment: and whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhall ſay to his brother, Raca, ſhall be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the council: but whoſoever ſhall ſay, Thou fool, ſhall be in danger of hell-fire.</q> Here CHRIST teaches us that the torments of wicked men will be different in different perſons, according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees of their guilt.—It ſhall be more tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for Sodom and Gomorrha, for Tyre and Sidon, than for the cities where moſt of CHRIST'S mighty works were wrought.—Again, our LORD aſſures <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s, That he that knoweth his LORD'S will, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth not himſelf, nor doth according to his will,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:016767_0176_0F9E17BA233CEB78"/>
ſhall be beaten with <hi>many</hi> ſtripes. But he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and committeth things worthy of ſtripes ſhall be beaten with few ſtripes.—Theſe ſeveral paſſages of ſcripture infallibly prove that there will be diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent degrees of puniſhment in hell; which is utterly inconſiſtent with the ſuppoſition, that that puniſhment conſiſts in annihilation, in which there can be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, but is the ſame thing to every one who is the ſubject of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The ſcriptures are very expreſs and abundant in this matter, that the eternal puniſhment of the wicked will conſiſt in ſenſible miſery and torment, and not in annihilation.—What is ſaid of Judas is worthy to be obſerved here, <q>It had been good for that man, if he had not been born;</q> Mat. xxvi. 24.—This ſeems plainly to teach us that the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked is ſuch that their exiſtence, upon the whole is worſe than non-exiſtence. But if their puniſhment conſiſts merely in annihilation, this is not true.—The wicked, in their puniſhment, are ſaid to <hi>weep,</hi> and <hi>wail,</hi> and <hi>gn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſh their teeth;</hi> which implies not only real exiſtence, but life, knowledge and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and that they are in a very ſenſible and exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite manner affected with their puniſhment.—In Iſaiah xxxiii. 14, Sinners in the ſtate of their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are repreſented <hi>to dwell</hi> with everlaſting burnings. But if they are only turned into nothing, where is the foundation for this repreſentation? It is abſurd to ſay that ſinners will <hi>dwell</hi> with annihilation; for there is no <hi>dwelling</hi> in the caſe. It is alſo abſurd to call an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilation, a <hi>burning,</hi> which implies a ſtate of exiſtence, ſenſibility and extreme pain; whereas in annihilation there is neither one nor another of theſe.—The ſtate of the future puniſhment of the wicked is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently repreſented to be a ſtate of exiſtence and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:016767_0177_0F9E17BAF8C43DE8"/>
when it is ſaid, that they ſhall be caſt into a lake of fire and brimſtone. How can this expreſſion with any propriety be underſtood to mean a ſtate of annihilation?—Yea they are expreſsly ſaid to <hi>have no reſt</hi> day nor nigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>THE ſpirits of ungodly men before the reſurrection, are not in a ſtate of annihilation, but in a ſtate of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; they are ſpirits in priſon, as the apoſtle ſaith of them that were drowned in the flood; 1 Pet. iii. 19.—And this appears very plainly from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the rich man, before mentioned, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as repreſenting the wicked in their ſeperate ſtate, between death and the reſurrection. But if the wicked even <hi>then,</hi> are in a ſtate of <hi>torment,</hi> much more will they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e, when they ſhall come to ſuffer that which is the proper puniſhment of their ſins.</p>
            <p>ANNIHILATION is not ſo great a calamity but that ſome men have undoubtedly choſen it, rather than ſuch a ſtate of ſuffering, as they have been in, even in this life. This was the caſe of Job, a good man. But if a good man in this world may ſuffer that which is worſe than annihilation; doubtleſs the proper pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of the wicked, in which GOD means to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his peculiar abhorrence of their wickedneſs, will be a calamity vaſtly greater ſtill; and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be annihilation. That muſt be a very mean and contemptible teſtimony of GOD'S wrath towards thoſe who have rebelled againſt his crown and dignity, have
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:016767_0178_0F9E17BBAF00E1F8"/>
broken his laws, and deſpiſed both his vengeance and his grace, which is not ſo great a calamity, as ſome of his true children have ſuffered in life.</p>
            <p>THE eternal puniſhment of the wicked is ſaid to be the <hi>ſecond death,</hi> once and again, as Rev. xx. 14. and xxi. 8.—It is doubtleſs called the ſecond death in referrence to the death of the body; and as the death of the body is ordinarily attended with great pain and diſtreſs, ſo the like, or ſomething vaſtly greater, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> implied to calling the eternal puniſhment of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the <hi>ſecond death;</hi> and there would be no propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety in calling it to, if it conſiſted merely in annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. And this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> death wicked men will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; for it cannot be called the ſecond death, with reſpect to any other than men; it cannot be called ſo with reſpect to devils, as they die no temporal death, which is the firſt death. In Rev<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ii. 11. <q>It is ſaid, He that overcometh, ſhall not be hurt of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond death;</q> implying that all who do not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come their luſts, but live in ſin, ſhall ſuffer the ſecond death.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, wicked men will ſuffer the ſame kind of death with the devils; as in verſe 25. of the context, <q>Depart ye curſed into everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels.</q> Now the puniſhment of the devil is not annihilation, but torment: he therefore trembles for fear of it; not for fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing annihilated, he would be glad of that. What he is afraid of is torment, as appears by Luke viii. 28. Where he cries out and beſeeches CHRIST that he would not <hi>torment</hi> him before the time. And it is ſaid, Rev. xx. 10. The devil that deceived them was caſt into the lake of fire and brimſtone, where the beaſt and the falſe prophet are, and ſhall be <hi>tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented</hi> day and night, for ever and ever.</p>

               <pb n="183" facs="unknown:016767_0179_0F9E17BCC7DF8C78"/>
IT is ſtrange how men will go directly againſt ſo plain and full revelations of ſcripture, as to ſuppoſe, notwithſtanding all theſe things, that the eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment threatened againſt the wicked, ſignifies no more, than annihilation.</p>
            <p>III. As the future puniſhment of the wicked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſenſible miſery; ſo it ſhall not only continue for a very long time, but ſhall be abſolutely without end.</p>
            <p>OF thoſe who have held that the torments of hell are not abſolutely eternal, there have been two ſorts. (1.) Some ſuppoſe that in the threatenings of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment, the terms uſed, do not neceſſarily import a proper eternity, but only a very long dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. (2.) Others ſuppoſe that if they do import a proper eternity; yet we cannot neceſſarily conclude thence, that GOD will fulfil his threatenings.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſhall,</p>
            <p>FIRST, ſhow that the threatenings of eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment do very plainly and fully import a proper, abſolute eternity, and not merely a long duration.</p>
            <p>This appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. BECAUSE when the ſcripture ſpeaks of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed's being ſentenced to their puniſhment, at the time when all temporal things are come to an end, it then ſpeaks of it as everlaſting, as in the text and elſewhere.—It is true that the term <hi>forever</hi> is not always in ſcripture uſed to ſignify eternity. Sometimes it means, as long as a man liveth. In this ſenſe it is ſaid, that the Hebrew ſervant, who choſe to abide with his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, ſhould have his ear bored, and ſhould ſerve his maſter <hi>forever.</hi>—Sometimes it means, during the continuance of the ſtate and church of the Jews. In this ſenſe ſeveral laws which were peculiar to that church, and were to continue in force no longer than that
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:016767_0180_0F9E17BE136B9690"/>
church ſhould laſt, are called <hi>ſtatutes forever.</hi> See Exod. xxvii 21. Chap. xxviii. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. &amp;c.—Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it means as long as the world ſtands. So in Eccles. i. 4. One generation paſſeth away, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generation cometh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> but the earth abideth <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND this laſt is the longeſt temporal duration, that ſuch a term is ever uſed to ſignify. There is no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of uſing ſuch a term, for a longer duration, when it ſignifies a temporal duration: For the duration of the world is doubtleſs the longeſt of any of thoſe things, that are temporal, as its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was the earlieſt of any of theſe things, that are temporal. Therefore when the ſcripture ſpeaks of things as being before the foundation of the world, it means that they exiſted from eternity and before the beginning of time. So thoſe things which continue after the end of the world, are eternal things, and are after the end of time.—Doubtleſs when the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral world is at an end, there will be an end to tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral things. When the time comes that heaven and earth are ſhaken and removed, thoſe things that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main will be things that cannot be ſhaken, but will remain for ever, Heb. xii. 26, 27.—This viſible world contains all things that are ſeen and are tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and therefore when that is at an end, there will be an end of all things that are temporal, and therefore the things that remain after that, will be eternal.</p>
            <p>BUT the puniſhment of the wicked will not only remain after the end of the world, but is called ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting after that, as in the text, <q>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment.</q> So in 2 Thes. i. 9, 10. <q>Who ſhall be puniſhed with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting deſtruction from the preſence of the LORD and from the glory of his power; when he ſhall come to be glorified in his ſaints.</q> &amp;c.—Now
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:016767_0181_0F9E17BEA2337670"/>
what can be meant by a thing's being everlaſting, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all temporal things are come to an end, but that it is abſolutely without end?</p>
            <p n="2">2. SUCH expreſſions are uſed to ſet forth the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the puniſhment of the wicked, as are never uſed in the ſcriptures of the New-Teſtament to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy any thing but a proper eternity. It is ſaid not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that that puniſhment ſhall be forever, but <hi>for ever and ever.</hi> Rev. xiv. 11; <q>The ſmoke of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment aſcendeth up <hi>for ever and ever.</hi>
               </q> Rev. xx. 10; <q>ſhall be tormented day and night, <hi>for ever and ever.</hi>
               </q>—Doubtleſs the New-Teſtament has ſome expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſignify a proper eternity, of which it has ſo often occaſion to ſpeak. But it is ignorant of any higher expreſſion than this: if this do not ſignify an abſolute eternity, there is none that does.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE ſcripture uſes the ſame way of ſpeaking to ſet forth the eternity of the puniſhment of the wicked, that it uſes to ſet forth the eternity of the happineſs of the righteous, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the eternity of GOD himſelf. Mat. xxv. 46.

Rev. xxii. 5. And they (the ſaints) ſhall reign <hi>for ever and ever.</hi> And the ſcripture has no higher expreſſion to ſignify the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> himſelf, than that of his being <hi>for ever and ever,</hi> as Rev. iv. 9. <q>To him who ſat on the throne, who liveth ſo ever and ever,</q> and in the 10th verſe, and in ch. v. 14. and ch. x. 6. and ch. xv. 7.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, the ſcripture expreſſes GOD'S eternity by this, that it ſhall be forever, after the world is come to an end; Pſal. cii. Xxvi, 27. <q>They ſhall periſh, but thou ſhalt endure: yea, all of them ſhall wax old like a garment; as a veſture ſhalt thou change
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:016767_0182_0F9E17C0E69BCDE8"/>
them, and they ſhall be changed. But thou art the ſame, and thy years ſhall have no end.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. THE ſcripture ſays that wicked men ſhall not be delivered, till they have paid the uttermoſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their debt; Mat. v. 26. Nor till they have paid the laſt mite; Luke x 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. i. e. the utmoſt that is deſerved, and all mercy is excluded by this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion. But we have ſhown that they deſerve an infinite, an endleſs puniſhment.</p>
            <p n="5">5. THE ſcripture ſays abſolutely, that their pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment ſhall not have an end. Mark ix. 44. <q>Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q> Now it will not do to ſay, That the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, Their worm ſhall live a great while, or that it ſhall be a great while before their fire is quenched. If ever the time comes, that their worm ſhall die; if ever there ſhall be a quenching of the fire at all, then it is not true, that their worm dieth not, and that the fire is not quenched. For if there be a dying of the worm, and a quenching of the fire, let it be at what time it will, nearer or further off, it is equally contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſuch a regation, <hi>is dieth not, it is not quenched.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SECONDLY. THERE are others who allow, that the expreſſions of the threatenings, do denote a proper eternity, but then, they ſay, it doth not certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the puniſhment will really be eternal; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, ſay they, GOD may threaten, and yet not fulfil his threatenings. Though they allow that the threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenings are poſitive, and peremptory, without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, yet they ſay GOD is not obliged to fulfil abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, poſitive threatenings, as he is, abſolute promiſes. Becauſe in promiſes a right is conveyed, that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to whom the promiſes are made, will claim; but there is no danger of the creature's claiming any right by a threatening.—Therefore I am now to ſhow that what GOD has poſitively declared in this
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:016767_0183_0F9E17C21CE0AB70"/>
matter, does indeed make it certain, that it ſhall be as he has declared. To this end I ſhall mention two things;</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is ſelfevidently contrary to the divine truth, poſitively to declare, any thing to be real, whether pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>, preſent, or to come, which GOD at the ſame time knows is not ſo. Abſolutely threatening that any thing ſhall be, is the ſame as abſolutely declaring, that it is to be. For any to ſuppoſe that GOD abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely declares that any thing will be, which he at the ſame time knows will not be, is blaſphemy, if there be any ſuch thing as blaſphemy.</p>
            <p>INDEED it is very true, that there is no obligation on GOD, ariſing from the claim of the creature, as there is in promiſes. They ſeem to reckon the wrong way, who ſuppoſe the neceſſity of the execution of the threatening, to ariſe from a proper obligation on GOD to the creature, to execute, conſequent on his threatening. For indeed the certainty of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ariſes the other way; <abbr>viz.</abbr> on the obligation there was on the omniſcient GOD, in threatening, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his threatening to what he knew would be fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in execution. Though ſtrictly ſpeaking GOD is not properly obliged to the creature, to execute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has threatened; yet he was obliged not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely to threaten if at the ſame time he knew, that he ſhould not, or would not fulfil: becauſe this would not have been conſiſtent with his truth.—So that from the truth of GOD, there is an inviolable connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between poſitive threatenings and execution. They that ſuppoſe, that GOD abſolutely threatened, or poſitively declared, that he would do, contrary to what he knew would come to paſs, do therein ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he abſolutely threatened contrary to what he knew to be truth. And how any one can ſpeak
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:016767_0184_0F9E17C266471A50"/>
contrary to what he knows to be truth, in declaring, promiſing, or threatening, or any other way, conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently with inviolable truth is inconceivable.</p>
            <p>THREATENINGS are ſignifications of ſomething; and if they are made conſiſtently with truth, they are true ſignifications, or ſignifications of truth, or ſignificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of that which ſhall be. If abſolute threatenings are ſignifications of any thing, they are ſignifications of the futurity of the things threatened. But if the futurity of the things threatened, be not true and real, then how can the threatening be a true ſignification? And if GOD, in them, ſpeaks contrary to what he knows, and contrary to what he intends, how he can ſpeak true, is inconceivable.</p>
            <p>ABSOLUTE threatenings are a kind of predictions; and though GOD is not properly obliged by any claim of our's, to fulfil predictions, unleſs they are of the nature of promiſes; yet it certainly would be contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to truth, to predict and ſay ſuch a thing would come to paſs, which he knew at the ſame time, would not come to paſs. Threatenings are declarations of ſomething future, and they muſt be declarations of future truth, if they are true declarations. It's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing future alters not the caſe any more than if it were preſent. It is equally contrary to truth, to declare contrary to what, at the ſame time is known to be truth, whether it be of things paſt, preſent, or to come: for all are alike to GOD.</p>
            <p>BESIDE, we have often declarations in ſcripture of the future eternal puniſhment of the wicked, in the proper form of predictions, and not in the form of threatenings. So in the text. Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment. So in thoſe frequent aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions of eternal puniſhment in the Revelation, ſome of which I have already quoted. The Revelation is a prophecy, and is ſo called in the book itſelf; ſo are thoſe

<pb n="189" facs="unknown:016767_0185_0F9E17C3349D0650"/>
declarations of eternal puniſhment.—The like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations we have alſo in many other places of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The doctrine of thoſe who teach that it is not certain, that GOD will fulfil thoſe abſolute threatening is blaſphemous another way; and that is, as GOD ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſuppoſition was obliged to make uſe of a fallacy to govern the world. They own that it is needful that men ſhould apprehend themſelves lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to an eternal puniſhment, that they might thereby be reſtrained from ſin, and that GOD has threatened ſuch a puniſhment, for the very end that they might believe themſelves expoſed to it. But what an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy opinion does this convey of GOD and his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, of his infinite majeſty, and wiſdom, and all-ſufficiency!—Beſide, they ſuppoſe that though GOD has made uſe of ſuch a fallacy, yet it is not ſuch an one but that they have detected him in it. Though GOD intended men ſhould believe it to be certain, that ſinners are liable to an eternal puniſhment; yet they ſuppoſe, that they have been ſo cunning as to find out that it is not certain. And ſo that GOD hath not laid his deſign ſo deep, but that ſuch cunning men as they can diſcern the cheat and defeat the deſign: becauſe they have found out, that there is no neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion between the threatening of eternal puniſhment and the execution of that threatening.</p>
            <p>CONSIDERING theſe things, is it not greatly to be wondered at, that the great archbiſhop <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> who has made ſo great a figure among the new faſhioned divines, ſhould advance ſuch an opinion as this?</p>
            <p>BEFORE I conclude this head, it may be proper for me to anſwer an objection or two, that may ariſe in the mids of ſome.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may be here ſaid, We have inſtances, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:016767_0186_0F9E17C3E329EC30"/>
GOD hath not fulfilled his threatenings; as his threatening to Adam and in him to mankind, that they ſhould <hi>ſurely</hi> die, if they ſhould eat the forbidden fruit. I anſwer, It is not true that GOD did not ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil that threatening: he fulfilled it, and will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it in every jot and tittle.—When GOD ſaid, <q>Thou ſhalt ſurely die,</q> if we reſpect ſpiritual death, it was fulfilled in Adam's perſon in the day that he ate. GOD immediately took away his image, his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and original righteouſneſs, which was the higheſt and beſt life of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ts; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately in a doleful ſtate of ſpiritual death.</p>
            <p>IF we reſpect temporal death, that was alſo fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: he brought death upon himſelf and all his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and he virtually ſuffered that death on that very day on which he ate. His body was brought into a corruptible, mortal and dying condition, and ſo it continued till it was diſſolved.—If we look at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal death, and indeed all that death, which was comprehended in the threatening, it was properly ſpeaking fulfilled in CHRIST. When GOD ſaid to Adam, If thou ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſt, thou ſhalt die, he ſpake not only to him, and of him perſonally; but the words reſpected mankind, Adam and his race, and doubtleſs were ſo underſtood by him. His offſpring were to be looked upon as ſinning in him, and ſo ſhould die with him. The words do as juſtly allow of an mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of death, as of ſin; they are as well conſiſtent with dying in a ſurety, as with ſinning in one. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the threatening is fulfilled in the death of CHRIST, the ſurety.</p>
            <p n="2">2. ANOTHER objection may ariſe from GOD'S threatening to Nineveh. He threatened that in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty days Nineveh ſhould be deſtroyed, which yet he did not fulfil.—I anſwer, that threatening could
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:016767_0187_0F9E17C4E7F8D190"/>
justly be looked upon no otherwise, than as conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal. It was of the nature of a warning, and not of an absolute denunciation. Why was Jonah sent to the Ninevites, but to give them warning, that they might have opportunity to repent, reform, and avert the approaching destruction? GOD had no other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign or end in sending the prophet to them, but that they might be warned and tried by him, as GOD warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Israelites, and warned Judah and Jerusalem before their destruction. Therefore the prophets, together with their prophecies of approaching destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, joined earnest exhortations to repent and reform, that it might be averted.</p>
            <p>No more could justly be understood to be certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatened, than that Nineveh should be destroyed in forty days <hi>continuing as it was.</hi> For it was for their wickedness that that destruction was threatened, and so the Ninevites took it. Therefore when the cause was removed, the effect ceased.—It was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to GOD'S known manner, to threaten punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and destruction for sin here in this world abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, so that it should come upon the persons threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened unavoidably, let them repent and reform and do what they would; agreeably to Jer. xviii. 7, 8. <q>At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; if that nation against whom I have pronounced, turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto them.</q>—So that all threatenings of this nature had a condition implied in them, according to the known and declared manner of GOD'S dealing. And the Ninevites did not take it as an abſolute ſentence or denunciation: if they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, they would have deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired of any <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> by fasting and reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="192" facs="unknown:016767_0188_0F9E17C564B1B8F8"/>
BUT the threatenings of eternal wrath are poſitive and abſolute There is nothing in the word of GOD, from which we can gather any condition. The only opportunity of eſcaping is in this world; this is the only ſtate of trial, wherein we have any offers of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, or there is any place for repentence.</p>
            <p>IV. I SHALL mention ſeveral good and important ends, which will be obtained by the eternal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the wicked.</p>
            <p n="1">1. HEREBY GOD vindicates his injured majeſty. Wherein ſinners caſt contempt upon it, and trample it in the duſt, GOD vindicates and honors it, and makes it appear, as it is indeed, infinite, by ſhowing that it is infinitely dreadful to contemn or offend it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD glorifies his juſtice.—The glory of GOD is the greateſt good; it is that which is the chief end of the creation; it is a thing of greater importance than any thing elſe. But this is one way wherein GOD will glorify himſelf, as in the eternal deſtruction of ungodly men, he will glorify his juſtice. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he will appear as a juſt governor of the world. The vindictive juſtice of God will appear ſtrict, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, awful and terrible, and therefore glorious.</p>
            <p n="3">3. GOD hereby indirectly glorifies his grace on the veſſels of mercy.—The ſaints in heaven will be hold the torments of the damned: <q>the ſmoke of their torment aſcendeth up for ever and ever.</q> Iſai. lxvi. 24. <q>And they ſhall go forth and look upon the carcaſes of the men, that have tranſgreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt me; for their worm ſhall not die, neither ſhall their fire be quenched, and they ſhall be an abhorring unto all fleſh.</q> And in Rev. xiv. 10. It is ſaid, that they ſhall be tormented in the preſence of the holy angels and in the preſence of the lamb.—So they will be tormented in the preſence alſo of the glorified ſaints.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="193" facs="unknown:016767_0189_0F9E17C6445DE3B0"/>
HEREBY the ſaints will be made the more ſenſible how great their ſalvation is. When they ſhall ſee how great the miſery is, from which GOD hath ſaved them, and how great a difference he hath made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their ſtate, and the ſtate of others, who were by nature, and perhaps by practice, no more ſinful and ill-deſerving than they; it will give them more of a ſenſe of the wonderfulneſs of GOD'S grace to them. Every time they look upon the damned, it will excite in them a lively and admiring ſenſe of the grace of GOD, in making them ſo to differ. This the apoſtle informs us is one end of the damnation of ungodly men; Rom. ix. 22, 23. <q>What if GOD willing to ſhow his wrath, and to make his power known, endured with much long-ſuffering the veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction; and that he might make known <hi>the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy,</hi> which he had afore prepared unto glory</q>—The view of the miſery of the damned will dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the ardour of the love and gratitude of the ſaints in heaven.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE ſight of hell-torments will exalt the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the ſaints forever. It will not only make them more ſenſible of the greatneſs and freeneſs of the grace of GOD in their happineſs; but it will really make their happineſs the greater, as it will make them more ſenſible of their own happineſs; it will give them a more lively reliſh of it; it will make them prize it more. When they ſee others, who were of the ſame nature, and born under the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, plunged in ſuch miſery, and they ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, O it will make them ſenſible, how happy they are. A ſenſe of the oppoſite miſery, in all ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes greatly increaſes the reliſh of any joy or pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The ſight of the wonderful power, the great and
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:016767_0190_0F9E17C9B0AAE878"/>
dreadful majeſty and awful juſtice and holineſs of GOD manifeſted in the eternal puniſhment of ungodly men, will make them prize his favour and love, vaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the more; and they will be ſo much the more happy in the enjoyment of it.</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p n="1">1. FROM what hath been ſaid, we may learn the folly and madneſs of the greater part of mankind, in that for the ſake of preſent momentary gratification, they run the venture of enduring all theſe eternal tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. They prefer a ſmall pleaſure, or a little wealth, or a little earthly honor and greatneſs, which can laſt but for a moment, to an eſcape from this puniſhment.—If it be true that the torments of hell are eternal, what will it profit a man, if he gain the whole world, and loſe his own ſoul; or what ſhall a man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his ſoul? What is there in this world, which is not a trifle, and lighter than vanity, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon with theſe eternal things?</p>
               <p>How mad are men, who ſo often hear of theſe things and pretend to believe them; who can live but a little while, a few years; who do not even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to live here longer than others of their ſpecies, ordinarily do; and who yet are careleſs about what becomes of themſelves in another world, where there is no change and no end!—How mad are they, when they hear that if they go <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

How can men be ſo carleſs of ſuch a matter as their own eternal and deſperate deſtruction and torment? What a ſtrange ſtupor and ſenſeleſſneſs poſſeſſes the hearts of men! How common a thing is it to ſee men, who are told from ſabbath to ſabbath of eternal miſery, and who are as mortal as other men, ſo careleſs about it, that they ſeem not to be at all reſtrained by it from whatever their ſouls luſt after! It is not half ſo much their care, to eſcape eternal miſery, as it is to get money and land, and to be conſiderable in the world, and to gratify their ſenſes. Their thoughts are much more exerciſed about theſe things, and much more of their care and concern is about them. Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſery, though they lie every day expoſed to it, is a thing neglected, it is but now and then thought of, and then with a great deal of ſtupidity, and not with concern enough to ſtir them up to do any thing conſiderable in order to eſcape it. They are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that it is worth their while to take any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pains in order to it. And if they do take pains for a little while, they ſoon leave off, and ſomething elſe takes up their thoughts and concern.</p>
               <p>THUS you will ſee it to be among young and old. Multitudes of thoſe who are in youth, lead a careleſs life, taking little care about their ſalvation. So you may ſee it to be among perſons of middle age. So it is ſtill with many, when advanced in years, and when they certainly draw near to the grave.—Yet theſe ſame perſons will ſeem to acknowledge, that the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter part of men go to hell and ſuffer eternal miſery, and this through careleſſneſs about it. However, they will do the ſame.—How ſtrange is it that men <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

ſoon the thread, by which they hang, will break, nor indeed do they pretend to know; and if it breaks, they are gone, they are loſt for ever, and there is no remedy! Yet they trouble not themſelves much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it; nor will they hearken to thoſe who cry to them, and intreat them to take care for themſelves, and labour to get out of that dangerous condition: they are not willing to take ſo much pains: they chooſe not to be diverted from amuſing themſelves with thoſe toys and vanities which they have in hand. Thus, well might the wiſe man ſay, as in Eccl. ix. 3. <q>The heart of the ſons of men is full of evil. Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is in their heart while they live; and after that they go to the dead.</q>
               </p>
               <p>How much wiſer are thoſe few, who make it their main buſineſs to lay a foundation for eternity, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their ſalvation!</p>
               <p n="2">2. I SHALL improve this ſubject in an uſe of <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation</hi> to ſinners, to take care to eſcape theſe eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal torments. If they be eternal, one would think that would be enough to awaken your concern, and excite your diligence. If the puniſhment be eternal, it is infinite, as we ſaid before, and therefore no other evil, no death, no temporary torment that ever you heard of, or that you can imagine, is any thing in compariſon with it, but is as much leſs and leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, not only as a grain of ſand is leſs than the whole univerſe, but as it is leſs than the boundleſs ſpace, which encompaſſes the univerſe.—Therefore here.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) BE entreated to conſider attentively how great and awful a thing eternity is. Although you cannot comprehend it the more by conſidering, yet you may be made more ſenſible that it is not a thing to be diſregarded.—Do but conſider what it is in
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:016767_0193_0F9E17CD00169928"/>
ſuffer extreme torment for ever and ever; to ſuffer it day and night, from one day to another, from one year to another, from one age to another, from one thouſand ages to another, and ſo adding age to age, and thouſands to thouſands in pain, in wailing and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting, groaning, and ſhrieking, and gnaſhing your teeth; with your ſouls full of dreadful grief and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, with your bodies and every member full of racking torture, without any poſſibility of getting eaſe; without any poſſibility of moving GOD to pity, by your cries; without any poſſibility of hiding yourſelves from him; without any poſſibility of diverting your thoughts from your pain; without any poſſibility of obtaining any manner of mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or help, or change for the better any way.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Do but conſider how dreadful deſpair will be in ſuch torment. How diſmal will it be, when you are under theſe racking torments, to know aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly that you never, never ſhall be delivered from them; to have no hope: when you ſhall wiſh that you might but be turned into nothing, but ſhall have no hope of it; when you ſhall wiſh that you might be turned into a toad or a ſerpent, but ſhall have no hope of it; when you would rejoice, if you might but have any relief, after you ſhall have endured theſe torments millions of ages, but ſhall have no hope of it; when after you ſhall have worn out the age of the ſun, moon and ſtars in your dolorous groans and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations, without reſt day or night, or one minute's eaſe, yet you ſhall have no hope of ever being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered; when after you ſhall have worn out a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand more ſuch ages, yet you ſhall have no hope, but ſhall know that you are not one whit nearer to the end of your torments; but that ſtill there are the ſame groans, the ſame ſhrieks, the ſame doleful cries inceſſantly to be made by you, and that the ſmoak of
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:016767_0194_0F9E17CDAD880568"/>
your torment ſhall ſtill aſcend up forever and ever, and that your ſouls, which ſhall have been agitated with the wrath of GOD all this while, yet will ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt to bear more wrath; your bodies, which ſhall have been burning and roaſting all this while in theſe glowing flames, yet ſhall not have been conſumed, but will remain to roaſt through an eternity yet, which will not have been at all ſhortened by what ſhall have been paſt.</p>
               <p>You may by conſidering make yourſelves more ſenſible, than you ordinarily are; but it is a little you can conceive of what it is to have no hope in ſuch torments.</p>
               <p>How ſinking would it be to you to endure ſuch pain, as you have felt in this world, without any hopes, and to know that you never ſhould be delivered from it, nor have one minute's reſt!

                  </gap>aſt weight of the wrath of GOD, without hope<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The more the damned in hell think of the eternity of their torments, the more amazing will it appear to them; and alas! they are not able to avoid thinking of it; they will not be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep it out of their minds. Their tortures will not divert them from it, but will fix their attention to it.—O how dreadful will eternity appear to them, after they ſhall have been thinking on it for ages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and ſhall have had ſo long an experience of their torments!—The damned in hell will have two infinites perpetually to amaze them, and ſwallow them up: One is an infinite GOD, whoſe wrath they will bear, and whom they will behold their perfect and irreconcilable enemy:—The other is the infinite duration of their torment.</p>
               <p>IF it were poſſible for the damned in hell to have a
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:016767_0195_0F9E17CE7347F1E8"/>
comprehenſive knowledge of eternity, their ſorrow and grief would be infinite in degree. The compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive view of ſo much ſorrow, which they muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure, would cauſe infinite grief for the preſent. Though they will not have a comprehenſive know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of it, yet they will doubtleſs have a vaſtly more lively and ſtrong apprehenſion of it, than we can have in this world. Their torments will give them an <hi>impreſſion</hi> of it.—A man in his preſent ſtate, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any enlargement of his capacity, would have a vaſtly more lively impreſſion of eternity than he has, if he were only under ſome pretty ſharp pain, in ſome member of his body, and were at the ſame time aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that he muſt endure that pain forever. His pain would give him a greater ſenſe of eternity, than other men have. How much more will thoſe excru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating torments, which the damned will ſuffer, have this effect!</p>
               <p>BESIDE, their capacity will probably be enlarged, their underſtandings will be quicker and ſtronger, in a future ſtate; and GOD can give them as great a ſenſe and as ſtrong an impreſſion of eternity, as he pleaſes to increaſe their grief and torment.</p>
               <p>O, BE entreated, ye that are in a chriſtleſs ſtate and are going on in a way to hell, that are daily expoſed to damnation, to conſider theſe things. If you do not, it will ſurely be but a little while, before you will experience them; and then you will know how dreadful it is, to diſpair in hell; and it may be before this year, or this month, or this week, is at an end; before another ſabbath, or ever you ſhall have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to hear another ſermon.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) THAT you may effectually eſcape theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and eternal torments, be intreated to flee to and embrace him, who came into the world for the very end of ſaving ſinners from theſe torments, who has
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:016767_0196_0F9E190F341F8568"/>
paid the whole debt due to the divine law, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted eternal in temporal ſufferings. What great encouragement is it to thoſe of you who are ſenſible that you are expoſed to eternal puniſhment, that there is a Saviour provided, who is able and who freely of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to ſave you from that puniſhment, and that in a way which is perfectly conſiſtent with the glory of GOD, yea which is more to the glory of GOD, than it would be, if you ſhould ſuffer the eternal puniſhment of hell. For if you ſhould ſuffer that puniſhment, you would never pay the whole of the debt. Thoſe who are ſent to hell, never will have paid the whole of the debt which they owe to GOD, nor indeed a part which bears any proportion to the whole. They never will have paid a part, which bears ſo great a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the whole, as one mite, to ten thouſand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants. Juſtice therefore never can be actually ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your damnation; but it is actually ſatisfied in CHRIST. Therefore he is accepted of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore all who believe, are accepted and juſtified in him. Therefore believe in him, come to him, commit your ſouls to him, to be ſaved by him. In him you ſhall be ſafe from the eternal torments of hell. Nor is that all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but thro' him you ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit inconceivable bleſſedneſs and glory, which will be of equal duration with the torments of hell. For as at the laſt day, the wicked ſhall go away into everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing puniſhment, ſo ſhall the righteous, or thoſe who truſt in CHRIST, go into life eternal.</p>

            <p>THESE words are a part of a moſt affectionate and affecting diſcourſe that CHRIST had with his diſciples, the ſame evening in which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd; knowing that he was to be crucified the next day. This diſcourſe begins with the 31ſt verſe of the xiii chapter, and is continued to the end of the xvi chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. CHRIST began his diſcourſe, after he had par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took of the paſſover with them, after he had inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and adminiſtered the ſacrament of the ſupper, and after Judas was gone out, and none were left but his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ue and faithful diſciples; whom he now addreſſes as his dear children. This was the laſt diſcourſe that ever CHRIST had with them before his death. As it was his parting diſcourſe, and as it were his dying diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, ſo it is on many accounts the moſt remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all the diſcourſes of CHRIST, which we have recorded in our bibles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="202" facs="unknown:016767_0198_0F9E18F937A3FCF0"/>
IT is evident this diſcourſe made a deep impreſſion on the minds of the diſciples; and we may ſuppoſe that it did ſo, in a ſpecial manner, on the mind of John the beloved diſciple, whoſe heart was eſpecially full of love to him, and who had juſt then been lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his boſom. In this diſcourſe CHRIST had told his dear diſciples that he was going away, which fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led them with ſorrow and heavineſs. The words of the text are ſome of the words which CHRIST ſaid to comfort them, and to relieve their ſorrow. He ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports them with the promiſe of that peace which he would leave with them, and which they would have in him and with him, when he was gone.</p>
            <p>THIS promiſe he delivers in three emphatical ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions which illuſtrate one another. "Peace I leave with you." As much as to ſay, though I am going away, yet I will not take all comfort away with me. While I have been with you, I have been your ſupport and comfort, and you have had peace in me, in the midſt of the loſſes you have ſuſtained and troubles you have met with in this evil generation. This peace I will not take from you, but leave it with you with great advantage, and in a more full poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>"My peace I give unto you." CHRIST by calling it <hi>his</hi> peace ſignifies two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THAT it was his own, that which he had to give. It was the peculiar benefit that he had to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on his children; now he was about to die and leave the world as to his human preſence. Silver and gold he had none: for while in his eſtate of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation he was poor. The foxes had holes, and the birds of the air had neſts: but the ſon of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> had not where to lay his head. Luke ix. 58. He had no earthly eſtate to leave to his diſciples who were as it were his family: but he had peace to give them.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="203" facs="unknown:016767_0199_0F9E18F9A42ED140"/>
2. IT was his peace that he gave them; as it was the ſame kind of peace which he himſelf enjoyed. The ſame excellent and divine peace which he ever had in GOD; and which he was about to receive in his exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtate in a vaſtly greater perfection and fullneſs: for the happineſs CHRIST gives to his people, is a partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of his own happineſs: agreeable to what CHRIST ſays in this ſame dying diſcourſe of his, chapter xv. 11 <q>Theſe things have I ſaid unto you that my joy might remain in you.</q> And in his prayer that he made with his diſciples at the concluſion of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. Chapter xvii. 13. <q>And now come I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, and theſe things I ſpeak in the world, that they might have my joy fulfilled in themſelves.</q> And verſe 22. <q>And the glory which thou gaveſt me, I have given them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>CHRIST here alludes to men's making their wills be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death. When parents are about to leave their children by death, they are wont in their laſt will and teſtament to give them their eſtate. That eſtate which they themſelves were wont to poſſeſs and enjoy. So it was with CHRIST when he was about to leave the world, with reſpect to the peace which he gave his diſciples; only with this difference, that earthly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, when they die, though they leave the ſame e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to their children which they themſelves heretofore enjoyed; yet when the children come to the full poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it, they enjoy it no more; the parents do not enjoy it with their children. The time of the full poſſeſſion of parents and children is not together. Whereas with reſpect to CHRIST'S peace he did not only poſſeſs it himſelf before his death, when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed it to his diſciples; but alſo afterwards more fully: ſo that they were received to poſſeſs it with him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="unknown:016767_0200_0F9E18FA8F486E08"/>
THE third and laſt expreſſion is, "<hi>not as the world giveth, give I unto you,</hi>" Whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> is as much as to ſay, my gifts and legacies, now I am going to leave the world, are not like thoſe which the rich and great men of the world are wont to leave to their heirs, when they die. They bequeath to their children their worldly poſſeſſions; and it may be, vaſt treaſures of ſilver and gold, and ſometimes an earthly kingdom. But the thing that I give you, is my peace, a vaſtly different thing from what they are wont to give, and which cannot be obtained by all that they can beſtow, or their children inherit from them.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE. THAT peace which CHRIST, when he died, left as a legacy to all his true ſaints, is very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe from all thoſe things, which the men of this world bequeath to their children, when they die.</p>
            <list>
               <item>I. CHRIST at his death made over the bleſſings of the new-covenant to believers, as it were in a will or teſtament.</item>
               <item>II. A GREAT bleſſing that CHRIST made over to believers in this his teſtament was his peace.</item>
               <item>III. THIS legacy of CHRIST is exceeding diverſe from all that any of the men of this world ever leave to their children, when they die,</item>
            </list>
            <p>I. CHRIST at his death made over the bleſſings of the new covenant to believers, as it were in a will or teſtament.</p>
            <p>THE new covenant is repreſented by the apoſtle as CHRIST'S laſt will and teſtament. Heb. ix. 15, 16, <q>And for this cauſe he is mediator of the new teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that by means of death, for the redemption of the tranſgreſſions that were under the firſt teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they which are called might receive the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of eternal inheritance. For where a teſtament is, there muſt alſo of neceſſity be the death of the teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.</q>
               <pb n="205" facs="unknown:016767_0201_0F9E18FC2C0E7910"/>
What men convey by their will or teſtament, is their own eſtate. So CHRIST in the new covenant conveys to believers his own inheritance, ſo far as they are capable of poſſeſſing and enjoying it. They have that eternal life given to them in their meaſure, which CHRIST himſelf poſſeſſes. They live in him, and with him, and by a participation of his life. <hi>Becauſe he lives they live alſo.</hi> They inherit his kinghom: the ſame kingdom which the father appointed unto him. Luke xxii. 29. <q>And I appoint unto you a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as my father hath appointed unto me.</q> They ſhall reign on his throne, Rev. iii. 21. They have his glory given to them. John xvii. And becauſe all things are CHRIST'S, ſo in CHRIST all things are alſo the ſaints 1. Cor. iii. 21, 22.</p>
            <p>MEN in their wills or teſtaments, moſt commonly give their eſtates to their children. So believers are in ſcripture repreſented as CHRIST'S children. Heb. ii. 13. <q>Behold, I, and the children which GOD hath given me.</q> Men moſt commonly make their wills a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before their death: ſo CHRIST did in a very ſpecial and ſolemn manner, make-over and confirm to his diſciples the bleſſings of the new covenant, on the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the day of his crucifixion, in that diſcourſe of which my text is a part. The promiſes of the new covenant were never ſo particularly expreſſed, and ſo ſolemnly given forth by CHRIST in all the time that he was upon earth, as in this diſcourſe. CHRIST pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes them manſions in his fathers houſe chapter xiv. 1, 2, 3. Here he promiſes them whatever bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings they ſhould need and aſk in his name. Chapter xv. 7. xvi. 23, 24. Here he does more ſolemnly and fully than any where elſe, give forth and confirm the promiſe of the HOLY SPIRIT, which is the ſum of the
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:016767_0202_0F9E18FCC8597768"/>
bleſſings of the covenant of grace. Chap. xiv. 16.—xvii. 26.—xv. 25.—xvi. 7. Here he promiſes them his own and his father's gracious preſence and favor. Chapter xiv. 18.—xix. 20, 21. Here he promiſes them peace in the text. Here he promiſes them his joy. Chapter xv. 11. Here he promiſes grace to bring forth holy fruits—Chapter xv. 11. And victory over the world. Chapter xvi. 33. And indeed there ſeems to be no where elſe ſo full and compleat an edition of the covenant of grace in the whole bible, as in this dying diſcourſe of CHRIST with his eleven true diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</p>
            <p>THIS covenant between CHRIST and his children is like a will or teſtament alſo in this reſpect, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes effectual, and a way is made for putting it in execution no other way than by his death; as the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle obſerves it is with a will or teſtament among men. For a teſtament is of force after men are dead, Heb. ix. 17. For though the covenant of grace in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed was of force before the death of CHRIST, yet it was of force no other wiſe than by his death: ſo that his death then did virtually intervene; being already undertaken and engaged. As a man's heirs come by the legacies bequeathed to them, no otherwiſe than by the death of the teſtator, ſo men come by the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal inheritance, no otherwiſe than by the death of CHRIST. If it had not been for the death of CHRIST they never could have obtained it.</p>
            <p>II. A GREAT bleſſing that CHRIST in his teſtament hath bequeathed to his true followers is his peace. Here are two things that I would obſerve particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <abbr>viz.</abbr> That CHRIST hath bequeathed to believers <hi>true</hi> peace; and then that the peace he has given them is <hi>his</hi> peace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. OUR LORD JESUS CHRIST has bequeathed true
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:016767_0203_0F9E18FED84852E8"/>
peace and comfort to his followers. CHRIST is called the prince of peace. Iſai ix. 6. And when he was born into the world, the angels on that joyful and wonderful occaſion ſang glory to GOD in the higheſt, on earth <hi>peace;</hi> becauſe of that peace which he ſhould procure for and beſtow on the children of men; Peace with GOD, and peace one with another, and tranquility and peace within themſelves which laſt is eſpecially the benefit ſpoken of in the text. This CHRIST has procured for his followers and laid a foundation for their enjoyment of, in that he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for them the other two, <abbr>viz,</abbr> peace with GOD, and one with another. He has procured for them peace and reconciliation with GOD and his favor and friendſhip; in that he ſatisfied for their ſins, and laid a foundation for the perfect removal of the guilt of ſin, and the forgiveneſs of all their treſpaſſes, and wrought out for them a perfect and glorious righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, moſt acceptable to GOD and ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them to GOD'S full acceptance and to the adoption of children, and to the eternal fruits of his fatherly kindneſs.</p>
            <p>BY theſe means true ſaints are brought into a ſtate of freedom from condemnation, and all the curſes of the law of GOD. Rom. viii. 34. <q>Who is he that condemneth</q>? And by theſe means they are ſafe from that dreadful and eternal miſery which natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are expoſed to, and are ſet on high out of the reach of all their enemies, ſo that the gates of hell and powers of darkneſs can never deſtroy them; nor can wicked men, tho' they may perſecute them, ever hurt them. Rom. viii. 31. <q>If GOD be for us, who can be againſt us?</q> Num. xxiii, 8. <q>How ſhall I curſe whom GOD hath not curſed.</q> verſe 23. <q>There is no enchantment againſt Jacob, neither is there
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:016767_0204_0F9E18FF57D72E10"/>
any divination againſt Iſrael.</q> By theſe means they are out of reach of death, John. vi, 4—ix, 50, 51. <q>This is the bread which cometh down from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that a man may eat thereof and not die.</q> By theſe means death with reſpect to them has loſt its ſting, and is no more worthy of the name of death 1 Cor. xv. 55. "O death where is thy ſting"? By theſe means they have no need to be afraid of the day of judgment when the heavens and earth ſhall be diſſolved. Ps. xlvi. 1, 2. <q>GOD is our refuge and ſtrength, a very preſent help in trouble. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will not we fear though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried into the midſt of the ſea.</q> Yea a true ſaint has reaſon to be at reſt in an aſſurance, that nothing can ſeparate him from the love of GOD. Rom. viii. 38, 39.</p>
            <p>THUS he that is got into CHRIST is in a ſafe refuge from every thing that might diſturb him; for this is that man ſpoken of Iſa. xxxii, 2. <q>And a man ſhall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempeſt, as rivers of water in a dry place; as the ſhadow of a great rock in a weary land.</q> And hence they that dwell in CHRIST have that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe fulfilled to them which we have in the 18th verſe of the ſame chapter; <q>And my people ſhall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in ſure dwellings, and in quiet reſting places.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND the true followers of CHRIST have not only ground of reſt and peace of ſoul by reaſon of their ſafety from evil, but on account of their ſure title and certain enjoyment of all that good which they ſtand in need of, living, dying and throughout all eternity. They are on a ſure foundation for happineſs, are built on a rock that can never be moved, and have a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that is ſufficient and can never be exhauſted.
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:016767_0205_0F9E1900EB7A4790"/>
The covenant is order'd in all things and ſure, and GOD has paſſed his word and oath, <q>that by two, immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for GOD to lie, we might have ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us.</q> The infinite Jehovah is become their GOD, who can do every thing for them. He is their portion who has an infinite fulneſs of good in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <q>He is their ſhield and exceeding great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</q> As great a good is made over to them as they deſire or can deſire or conceive of; yea as great and as ſweet as they are capable of; and to be conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued as long as they deſire; and this is made as ſure as they can deſire: Therefore they have reaſon to put their hearts at reſt, and be at peace in their minds.</p>
            <p>BESIDES he has bequeathed peace to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of his people, as he has procured for them and made over to them, the ſpirit of grace and true holineſs; which has a natural tendency to the peace and quietneſs of the ſoul. It has ſuch a tendency as it implies a diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very and reliſh of a ſuitable and ſufficient good. It brings a perſon into a view of divine beauty and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o a reliſh of that good which is a man's proper happineſs; and ſo it brings the ſoul to its true centre? The ſoul by this means is brought to reſt, and ceaſes from reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsly inquiring; as others do, who will ſhew us any good; and wandering to and fro like loſt ſheep ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſt and finding none. The ſoul hath found him who is as the apple tree among the trees of the wood, and ſits down under his ſhadow with great delight and his fruit is ſweet unto his taſte. Cant. ii. 2. And thus is that ſaying of CHRIST fulfilled. John iv. 14. "Whoſoever drinketh of the water that I ſhall give him ſhall never thirſt." And beſides true grace naturally tends to peace and quietneſs as it ſettles things in the
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:016767_0206_0F9E190120DEA858"/>
ſoul in their due order, ſets reaſon on the throne and ſubjects the ſenſes and affections to its government, which before were uppermoſt and put all things into confuſion and uproar in the ſoul. Grace tends to tranquility as it mortifies tumultuous deſires and paſſions, ſubdues the eager and inſatiable appetites of the ſenſual nature and greedineſs after the vanities of the world. It mortifies ſuch principles as hatred, variance, emulation, wrath envyings and the like, which are a continual ſource of inward uneaſineſs and perturbation; and ſupplies thoſe ſweet, calming and quieting principles of humility, meekneſs, reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, patience, gentleneſs, forgiveneſs, and ſweet reliance on GOD. It alſo tends to peace as it fixes the aim of the ſoul to a certain end; ſo that the ſoul is no longer diſtracted and drawn contrary ways by oppoſite ends to be ſought, and oppoſite portions to be obtained, and many maſters of contrary wills and commands to be ſerved; but the heart is fixed in the choice of one certain, ſufficient and unfailing good: and the ſoul's aim at this, and hope of it, is like an anchor to it, that keeps it ſtedfaſt that it ſhould no more be driven to and fro by every wind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THIS peace which CHRIST has left as a legacy to his true followers, is <hi>his</hi> peace. It is the peace which himſelf enjoys. This is what I take to be that which is principally intended in the expreſſion. It is the peace that he enjoyed while on earth, in his ſtate of humiliation; though he was a man of ſorrows and acquainted with grief, and was every where ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and perſecuted by men and devils, and had no place of reſt in this world; yet in GOD his father he had peace. We read of his rejoicing in ſpirit, Luke x. 21. SO CHRIST'S true diſciples, though in the world they have tribulation, yet in GOD have peace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="211" facs="unknown:016767_0207_0F9E190475864158"/>
WHEN CHRIST had finiſhed his labours and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings and roſe from the dead, and aſcended into heaven; then he entered into his reſt, and into a ſtate of moſt bleſſed perfect and everlaſting peace: deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by his own ſufferings from our imputed guilt, acquitted and juſtified of the father on his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; having obtained a perfect victory over all his enemies; was received of his father into heaven, the reſt which he had prepared for him, there to enjoy his hearts deſire fully and perfectly to all eternity. And then were thoſe words in the ſix firſt verſes of the 21ſt Pſalm, which have reſpect to CHRIST, fulfilled. This peace and reſt of the Meſſiah is doubtleſs exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorious. Iſai. xi. 10. <q>And his reſt ſhall be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</q> This reſt is what CHRIST has procured not only for himſelf, but alſo his people, by his death; and has bequeathed it to them that they may enjoy it with him, imperfectly in this world and perfectly and eternally in another world.</p>
            <p>THAT peace, which has been deſcribed, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers enjoy, is a participation of the peace which their glorious Lord and maſter himſelf enjoys, by virtue of the ſame blood of CHRIST, by which CHRIST himſelf has entered into reſt; it is in a participation of this ſame juſtification: for believers are juſtified with CHRIST. As he was juſtified when he roſe from the dead, and as he was made free from our guilt which he had as our ſurety; ſo believers are juſtified in him and through him. It is as being accepted of GOD in the ſame righteouſneſs: It is in the favour of the ſame GOD and heavenly father, that they enjoy peace. <q>I aſcend to my father and your father, to my GOD and your GOD.</q> It is in a participation of the ſame ſpirit; for believers have the ſpirit of CHRIST. He had the ſpirit given to him not by
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:016767_0208_0F9E1905CDB22250"/>
meaſure, and of his fulneſs do they all receive and grace for grace. As the oil poured on the head of Aaron went down to the ſkirts of his garments, ſo the ſpirit poured on CHRIST the head, deſcends to all his members. It is as partaking of the ſame grace of the ſpirit, that believers enjoy this peace; John i. 16.</p>
            <p>IT is as being united to CHRIST and living by a participation of his life, as a branch lives by the life of the vine. It is as partaking of the ſame love of GOD; John xvii. 26. <q>That the love wherewith thou haſt loved me may be in them.</q>—It is as having a part with him in his victory over the ſame enemies: and alſo as having an intereſt in the ſame kind of eternal reſt and peace. Eph. ii. 5, 6. <q>Even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickened us to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with CHRIST,—and hath raiſed us up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, and hath made us ſit together in heavenly places.</q>
            </p>
            <p>III. THIS legacy of CHRIST to his true diſciples, is very diverſe from all that the men of this world ever leave to their children, when they die. The men of this world, many of them, when they come to die, have great eſtates to bequeath to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, an abundance of the good things of this world, large <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of ground perhaps in a fruitful ſoil, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>. They ſometimes leave to their children fra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and vaſt treaſures of ſilver, gold, jewels and precious things, fetched from both the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, and from every ſide of the globe of the earth. They leave them wherewith to live in much ſtate and magnificence and make a great ſhow among men, to fare very ſumptuouſly and ſwim in worldly pleaſures. Some have crowns, ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and palaces, and great monarchies to leave to their heirs. But none of theſe things are to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:016767_0209_0F9E190678628E18"/>
to that bleſſed peace of CHRIST which he has bequeathed to his true followers. Theſe things are ſuch as GOD commonly in his providence gives his worſt enemies, thoſe whom he hates and deſpiſes moſt. But CHRIST'S peace is a precious benefit which he reſerves for his peculiar favourites Theſe worldly things, even the beſt of them, that the men and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the world leave for their children, are things which GOD in his providence throws out to thoſe whom he looks on as dogs, but CHRIST'S peace is the bread of his children. All theſe earthly things are but empty ſhadows, which however men ſet their hearts upon them, are not bread and never can ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy their ſouls; but this peace of CHRIST is a truly ſubſtantial ſatisfying food. Iſai. lv. 2. None of thoſe things, if men have them to the beſt advantage and in ever ſo great abundance, can give true peace and reſt to the ſoul, as is abundantly manifeſt not only in reaſon, but experience; it being found in all ages that thoſe who have the moſt of them, have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the leaſt quietneſs of mind. It is true there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> be a kind of quietneſs, a falſe peace they may have in their enjoyment of worldly things; men may bleſs their ſouls and think themſelves the only happy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and deſpiſe others; may ſay to their ſouls, as the rich man did, Luke xii. 19. <q>Soul, thou haſt much goods laid up for many years, take thine eaſe, eat, drink and be merry.</q> But CHRIST'S peace which he gives to his true diſciples, vaſtly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from this peace, that men may have in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, in the following reſpects:</p>
            <p n="1">1. CHRIST'S peace is a reaſonable peace and reſt of ſoul; it is what has its foundation in light and knowledge in the proper exerciſes of reaſon, and a right view of things; whereas the peace of the world
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:016767_0210_0F9E1907B73D7EA8"/>
is founded in blindneſs and deluſion. The peace that the people of CHRIST have, ariſes from their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their eyes open and ſeeing things as they be. The more they conſider, and the more they know of the truth and reality of things; the more they know what is true concerning themſelves, the ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they are in; the more they know of GOD, and the more certain they are that there is a GOD, and the more they know what manner of being he is; the more certain they are of another world and future judgment, and of the truth of GOD'S threatnings and promiſes; the more their conſciences are awakened and enlightened, and the brighter and the more ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the light is that they ſee things in; the more is their peace eſtabliſhed. Whereas on the contrary the peace that the men of the world have in their worldly enjoyments, can ſubſiſt no otherwiſe, than by their being kept in ignorance. They muſt be blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded and deceived, otherwiſe, they can have no peace: do but let light in upon their conſciences, ſo that they may look about them and ſee what they are, and what circumſtances they are in, and it will at once deſtroy all their quietneſs and comfort. Their peace can live no where but in the dark. Light turns their eaſe into torment. The more they know what is true concerning GOD and concerning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the more they are ſenſible of the truth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thoſe enjoyments which they poſſeſs, and the more they are ſenſible what things now are, and what things are like to be hereafter; the more will their calm be turned into a ſtorm. The worldly man's peace can't be maintained but by avoiding conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reflection. If he allows himſelf to think and properly to exerciſe his reaſon, it deſtroys his quietneſs and comfort. If he would eſtabliſh his
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:016767_0211_0F9E1907E124E8B8"/>
carnal peace it concerns him to put out the light of his mind, and turn beaſt as faſt as he can. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of reaſon if at liberty, proves a mortal enemy to his peace. It concerns him, if he would keep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live his peace, to continue all ways that may be, to ſtupify his mind and deceive himſelf, and to imagine things to be otherwiſe than they be. But with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the peace which CHRIST gives, reaſon is its great friend. The more this faculty is exerciſed, the more it is eſtabliſhed. The more they conſider and view things with truth and exactneſs, the firmer is their comfort and the higher their joy. How vaſt a difference is there between the peace of a chriſtian and the wordling! How miſerable are they who can't enjoy peace any otherwiſe than by hiding their eyes from the light and confining themſelves to darkneſs; whoſe peace is properly ſtupidity; as the eaſe that a man has, who has taken a doſe of ſtupifying poiſon, and the eaſe and pleaſure that a drunkard may have, in an houſe on fire over his head, or the joy of a diſtracted man in thinking that he is a king, though a miſerable wretch confined in Bedlam. Whereas the peace that CHRIST gives his true diſciples is the light of life, ſomething of the tranquility of heaven, the peace of the celeſtial paradiſe that has the glory of GOD to lighten it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. CHRIST'S peace is a virtuous and holy peace. The peace that the men of the world enjoy is vicious; it is a vile ſtupidity that depraves and debaſes the mind and makes men brutiſh. But the peace that the ſaints enjoy in CHRIST, is not only their comfort, but it is a part of their beauty and dignity. The chriſtian tranquility, reſt and joy of real ſaints, are not only unſpeakable privileges, but they are virtues and graces of GOD'S ſpirit, wherein the image of GOD
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:016767_0212_0F9E1908D4A47838"/>
in them does partly conſiſt. This peace has its ſource in thoſe principles that are in the higheſt degree vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous and amiable, ſuch as poverty of ſpirit, holy reſignation, truſt in GOD, divine love, meekneſs and charity. The exerciſe of ſuch bleſſed fruits of the ſpirit as are ſpoken of Gal. v. 22, 23.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THIS peace greatly differs from that which is enjoyed by the men of the world, with regard to its exquiſite ſweetneſs. It is a peace that paſſes all that natural men enjoy in worldly things ſo much that it paſſes their underſtanding and conception. Phil. iv. 7. It is exquiſitely ſweet; becauſe it has ſo firm a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as the everlaſting rock that never can be mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is ſweet, becauſe perfectly agreeable to reaſon: It is ſweet, becauſe it riſes from holy and divine principles, that as they are the virtue ſo they are the proper happineſs of men.</p>
            <p>IT is exquiſitely ſweet becauſe of the greatneſs of the objective good that the ſaints enjoy, and have peace and reſt in, being no other than the infinite bounty and fullneſs of that GOD, who is the fountain of all good. It is ſweet on account of the fullneſs and perfection of that proviſion that is made for it in CHRIST and the new covenant, where there is a foundation laid for the ſaints perfect peace; and hereafter they ſhall actually enjoy perfect peace; and though their peace is not now perfect, it is not ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any defect in the proviſion made, but in their own imperfection and miſery, ſin and darkneſs; and becauſe as yet they do partly cleave to the world and ſeek peace from thence, and don't perfectly cleave to CHRIST. But the more they do ſo, and the more they ſee of the proviſion there is made, and accept of it, and cleave to that alone, the nearer are they brought to perfect tranquility. Iſai. xxvi. 5.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="217" facs="unknown:016767_0213_0F9E19098E06A320"/>
4. THE peace of the chriſtian infinitely differs from that of the worldling, in that it is unfailing and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal peace. That peace which carnal men have in the things of the world, is according to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is built upon, of ſhort continuance; like the comfort of a dream. 1 Joh. ii. 17. 1 Cor. vii. 31. Theſe things, the beſt and moſt durable of them, are like bubbles on the face of the water; then vaniſh in a moment. Hos. x. 7.</p>
            <p>BUT the foundation of the chriſtians peace is ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting; it is what no time, no change, can deſtroy. It will remain when the body dies: it will remain when the mountains depart and the hills ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and when the heavens ſhall be rolled toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a ſcroll. The fountain of his comfort ſhall never be diminiſhed, and the ſtream ſhall never be dried. His comfort and joy is a living ſpring in the ſoul, a well of water ſpringing up to everlaſting life.</p>

youth, you have this day an offer made to you of that excellent and everlaſting peace and bleſſedneſs, which CHRIST has purchaſed with the price of his own blood, and beſtows only on thoſe that are his peculiar favourites, his redeemed ones, that are his portion and treaſure, the objects of his everlaſting love. As long as you continue to reject thoſe offers and invitations of CHRIST and continue in a chriſtleſs condition, you never will enjoy any true peace or comfort; but in whatever circumſtances you are, you will be miſerable; you will be like the prodigal that in vain endeavored to fill his belly with the huſks that the ſwine did eat: the wrath of GOD will abide upon and miſery will attend you wherever you go, which you never will by any means be able to eſcape. CHRIST gives peace to the moſt ſinful and miſerable that come to him. He heals the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds. But it is impoſſible that they ſhould have peace, that continue in their ſins. Iſai. lvii. 19, 20, 21. There is no peace between GOD and them; as they have the guilt of ſin remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

But it is moſt largely inſiſted on, in theſe two epiſtles to the Corinthians; in this firſt epiſtle, chapter xvi. and in the ſecond epiſtle chapter viii and ix.—The
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:016767_0218_0F9E190D5EA9AF88"/>
apoſtle begins the directions, which in this place he delivers concerning this matter, with the words of the text;—wherein we may obſerve</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHAT is the thing to be done concerning which the apoſtle gives them direction, and that is the making of a collection for the ſaints; the exerciſe and manifeſtation of their charity towards their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, by communicating to them, for the ſupply of their wants; which was by CHRIST and his apoſtles often ſpoken of and inſiſted on, as one main duty of the chriſtian religion, and is expreſsly declared to be ſo, by the apoſtle James, chapter i. 27. <q>Pure religion and undefiled before GOD and the father is this, to viſit the fatherleſs and widows in their afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. WE may obſerve the time on which the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle directs that this ſhould be done, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>on the firſt day of the week.</q> By the inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt he inſiſts upon it, that it be done on ſuch a particular day of the week, as if no other day would do ſo well as that, or were ſo proper and fit a time for ſuch a work.—Thus, although the inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed apoſtle was not for making that diſtinction of days in goſpel times, which the Jews made, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by Gal. iv. 10. <q>Ye obſerve days, and months, and times, and years: I am afraid of you, leſt I have beſtowed upon you labour in vain;</q> yet here he gives the preference to one day of the week, before any other, for the performance of a certain great duty of chriſtianity.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT may be obſerved that this is the direction, which the apoſtle had given to other churches that were concerned in the ſame duty, upon this occaſion: he had given direction to them alſo to do it on the firſt day of the week: <q>As I have given orders to the churches of Galatia, even ſo do ye.</q> Whence
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:016767_0219_0F9E190F60EC92D8"/>
we may learn that it was nothing peculiar in the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the Corinthians at Corinth, which was the reaſon why the Holy Ghoſt inſiſted, that they ſhould perform this duty on this day of the week. The apoſtle had given the like order to the churches of <hi>Galatia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOW Galatia was far diſtant from Corinth; the ſea parted them; and beſides that, there were ſeveral other countries between them. Therefore it cannot be thought that the Holy Ghoſt directs them to this time upon any ſecular account, having reſpect to ſome particular circumſtances of the people in that city; but upon a religious account. In giving the preference to this day for ſuch work, before any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, he has reſpect to ſome thing which reached all chriſtians throughout the wide world.</p>
            <p>AND by other paſſages of the new teſtament, we learn that the caſe was the ſame as to other exerciſes of religion; and that in the age of the apoſtles, the firſt day of the week was preferred before any other day, among the primitive chriſtians and in churches immediately under the care of the apoſtles, for an attendance on the exerciſes of religion in general. Acts xx. 7. <q>Upon the firſt day of the week, when the diſciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them.</q>—It ſeems by theſe things to have been among the primitive chriſtians in the apoſtles days, with reſpect to the firſt day of the week, as it was among the Jews, with reſpect to the ſeventh.</p>
            <p>WE are taught by CHRIST, that the doing of alms and ſhowing of mercy are proper works for the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day. When the Phariſees found fault with CHRIST for ſuffering his diſciples to pluck the ears of corn and eat on the ſabbath. CHRIST corrects
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:016767_0220_0F9E191487587288"/>
them with that, <q>I will have mercy and not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</q> Mat. xii. 7. And CHRIST teaches that works of mercy are proper to be done on the ſabbath, in Luke xiii. 15, 16. and xiv. 5.—Theſe works uſed to be done on ſacred feſtivals and days of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, under the old teſtament, as in Nehemiah's and Eſther's time; Neh. viii. 10. and Eſth. ix. 19, 22.—And <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Philo,</hi> two very noted Jews, who wrote not long after CHRIST'S time, give an account that it was the manner among the Jews on the ſabbath, to make collections for ſacred and pious uſes.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE. IT is the mind and will of GOD, that the firſt day of the week ſhould be eſpecially ſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part among chriſtians, for religious exerciſes and duties.</p>
            <p>THAT this is the doctrine which the Holy Ghoſt intended to teach us, by this and from other paſſages of the new teſtament, I hope will appear plainly by the ſequel. This is a doctrine that we have been generally brought up in by the inſtructions and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of our anceſtors; and it is and has been the general profeſſion of the chriſtian world, that this day ought to be religiouſly obſerved and diſtinguiſhed from other days of the week. However ſome deny it. Some refuſe to take any notice of the day, or any way to difference it from other days. Others own that it is a laudable cuſtom of the chriſtian church, into which ſhe fell by agreement, and by appointment of her ordinary rulers, to ſet apart this day for public worſhip. But they deny any other original to ſuch an obſervation of the day, than pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dential human appointment.—Others religiouſly obſerve the Jewiſh ſabbath, ſuppoſe that the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that is of perpetual obligation, and that we
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:016767_0221_0F9E1915B1FB2A80"/>
want foundation for determining that that is abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and another day of the week is appointed in the room of the ſeventh.</p>
            <p>ALL theſe claſſes of men ſay, that there is no clear, revelation that it is the mind and will of GOD, that the firſt day of the week ſhould be obſerved as a day to be ſet apart for religious exerciſes, in the room of the antient ſabbath; which there ought to be, in order to the obſervation of it by the chriſtian church, as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution. They ſay, that we ought not to go upon the tradition of paſt ages, or upon uncertain and far fetched inferences from ſome paſſages of the hiſtory of the new teſtament, or upon ſome obſcure and uncertain hints in the apoſtles writings; but that we ought to expect a plain inſtitution; which they ſay, we may conclude GOD would have give us, if he had deſigned that the whole chriſtian church, in all ages, ſhould obſerve another day of the week for an holy ſabbath, than that which was appointed of old, by plain and poſitive inſtitution.</p>
            <p>SO far is undoubtedly true, that if this be the mind and will of GOD, he hath not left the matter to human tradition; but hath ſo revealed his mind about it, in his word, that there is there to be found good and ſubſtantial evidence that it is his mind: and doubtleſs, the revelation is plain enough for them that have ears to hear; that is, for them that will juſtly exerciſe their underſtandings about what GOD ſays to them. No chriſtian, therefore, ſhould reſt till he has ſatisfactorily diſcovered the mind of GOD in this matter. If the chriſtian ſabbath be of divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, it is doubtleſs of great importance to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, that it be well kept; and therefore, that every chriſtian be well acquainted with the inſtitution.</p>
            <p>IF men only take it upon truſt, and keep the firſt day of the week only becauſe their parents taught
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:016767_0222_0F9E191709020F90"/>
them ſo, or becauſe they ſee others do ſo, and ſo they take it for certain, that it is right; they will never be likely to keep it ſo conſcientiouſly and ſtrictly, as if they had ſeen with their own eyes, and had been convinced by ſeeing for themſelves, good grounds in the word of GOD, for their practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unleſs they do ſee thus for themſelves, whenever they are negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in ſanctifying the ſabbath, or are guilty of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faning it; their conſciences will not have that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to ſmite them for it, as otherwiſe they would.—And thoſe who have a ſincere deſire to obey GOD in all things, will keep the ſabbath more carefully and more chearfully, if they have ſeen and been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that therein they do what is according to the will and command of GOD, and what is acceptable to him; and will alſo have a great deal more comfort in the reflection upon their having carefully and painfully kept the ſabbath.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, I deſign now, by the help of GOD, to ſhow, that it is ſufficiently revealed in the ſcriptures, to be the mind and will of GOD, that the firſt day of the week ſhould be diſtinguiſhed, in the chriſtian church, from other days of the week, as a ſabbath, to be devoted to religious exerciſes.</p>
            <p>IN order to this, I ſhall here premiſe, that the mind and will of GOD, concerning any duty to be performed by us, may be ſufficiently revealed in his word, without a particular precept in ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, enjoining it.—The human underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is the ear to which the word of GOD is ſpoken; and if it be ſo ſpoken, that that ear may plainly hear it, it is enough. GOD is ſovereign as to the manner of ſpeaking his mind, whether he will ſpeak it in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms, or whether he will ſpeak it by ſaying ſeveral other things which imply it, and from which
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:016767_0223_0F9E1917A54A0158"/>
we may, by comparing them together, plainly perceive it. If the mind of GOD be but revealed, if there be but ſufficient means for the communication of his mind to our minds, that is ſufficient; whether we hear ſo many expreſs words with our ears, or ſee them in writing with our eyes; or whether we ſee the thing that he would ſignify to us, by the eye of reaſon and underſtanding.</p>
            <p>WHO can poſitively ſay, that if it had been the mind of GOD, that we ſhould keep the firſt day of the week, he would have commanded it in expreſs terms, as he did the obſervation of the ſeventh day of old?—Indeed, if GOD had ſo made our faculties, that we were not capable of receiving a revelation <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> his mind in any other way; then there would have been ſome reaſon to ſay ſo. But GOD hath given us ſuch underſtandings, that we are capable of receiving a revelation, when made in another manner. And if GOD deals with us agreeably to our natures, and in a way ſuitable to our capacities, it is enough. If GOD diſcovers his mind in any way whatſoever, provided it be according to our faculties, we are obliged to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; and GOD may expect our notice and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of his revelation, in the ſame manner as if he had revealed it in expreſs terms.</p>
            <p>I SHALL ſpeak upon this ſubject under theſe two general propoſitions:</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is ſufficiently clear, that it is the mind of GOD, that one day of the week ſhould be devoted to reſt, and to religious exerciſes, throughout all ages and nations.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT is ſufficiently clear, that under the goſpel diſpenſation, this day is the firſt day of the week.</p>
            <p n="1">1. PROP. IT is ſufficiently clear, that it is the mind of GOD, that one day of the week ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:016767_0224_0F9E19186441E410"/>
to reſt, and to religious exerciſes, throughout all ages and nations; and not only among the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Iſraelites, till CHRIST came, but even in theſe goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel times, and among all nations profeſſing Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity.</p>
            <p>I. FROM the conſideration of the nature and ſtate of mankind in this world, it is moſt conſonant to human reaſon, that certain fixed parts of time ſhould be ſet apart, to be ſpent by the church wholly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exerciſes, and in the duties of divine worſhip. It is a duty incumbent on all mankind, in all ages a like, to worſhip and ſerve GOD. His ſervice ſhould be our great buſineſs. It becomes us to worſhip him with the greateſt devotion and engagedneſs of mind; and therefore to put ourſelves, at proper times, in ſuch circumſtances, as will moſt contribute to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our minds entirely devoted to this work, without being diverted or interrupted by other things.</p>
            <p>THE ſtate of mankind in this world is ſuch, that we are called to concern ourſelves in ſecular buſineſs and affairs, which will neceſſarily, in a conſiderable degree, take up the thoughts and engage the attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the mind. However, ſome particular perſons may be in ſuch circumſtances, as to be more free and diſengaged; yet the ſtate of mankind is ſuch, that the bulk of them, in all ages and nations, are called ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily to exerciſe their thoughts about ſecular affairs, and to follow worldly buſineſs, which in it's own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is remote from the ſolemn duties of religion.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore moſt meet and ſuitable, that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain times ſhould be ſet apart, upon which men ſhould be required to throw by all other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, that their minds may be the more freely and entirely engaged in ſpiritual exerciſes, in the duties of religion, and in the immediate wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:016767_0225_0F9E191959388718"/>
of GOD; and that their minds being diſengaged from common concerns, their religion may not be mixed with them.</p>
            <p>IT is alſo ſuitable that theſe times ſhould be fixed and ſettled, that the church may agree therein, and that they ſhould be the ſame for all, that men may not interrupt one another; but may rather aſſiſt one another by mutual example. For example has a great influence in ſuch caſes. If there be a time ſet apart for public rejoicing, and there be a general ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtation of joy, the general example ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire men with a ſpirit of joy and mirth; one kindles another.—So, if it be a time of mourning, and there be general appearances and manifeſtations of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> it naturally affects the mind, it diſpoſes it to depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, it caſts a gloom upon it, and does as it were dull and deaden the ſpirits.—So, if a certain time be ſet apart as holy time, for general devotion, and ſolemn religious exerciſes, a general example tends to render the ſpirit ſerious and ſolemn.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WITHOUT doubt, one proportion of time is better and fitter than another, for this purpoſe. One proportion is more ſuitable to the ſtate of mankind, and will have a greater tendency to anſwer the ends of ſuch times, than another. The times may be too far aſunder: I think human reaſon is ſufficient to diſcover, that it would be too ſeldom for the purpoſes of ſuch ſolemn times, that they ſhould be but once a year. So, I conclude, no body will deny, but that ſuch times may be too near together to agree with the ſtate and neceſſary affairs of mankind.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, there can be no difficulty in allowing, that ſome certain proportion of time, whether we can exactly diſcover it or not, is really fitteſt and beſt; and conſidering all things, conſidering the end for
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:016767_0226_0F9E1919F3E53F70"/>
which ſuch times are kept, and the condition, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and neceſſary affairs of men, and conſidering what the ſtate of man is, taking one age and nation with another, that one proportion of time is more convenient and ſuitable, than any other: which GOD may know and exactly determine, though we, by reaſon of the ſcantineſs of our underſtandings, cannot.</p>
            <p>AS a certain frequency of the returns of theſe times may be more ſuitable, than any other, ſo one length or continuance of the times themſelves may be fitter than another, to anſwer the purpoſes of ſuch times. If ſuch times, when they come, were to laſt but an hour, it would not well anſwer the end; for then worldly things would crowd too nearly upon ſacred exerciſes, and there would not be that opportunity to get the mind ſo thoroughly free and diſengaged from other things, as there would be, if the times were long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. But they being ſo ſhort, ſacred and profane things would be as it were mixed together.—There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a certain diſtance between theſe times, and a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain continuance of them, when they come, is more proper than others; which GOD knows and is able to determine, though perhaps we cannot.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT is unreaſonable to ſuppoſe any other, than that GOD'S working ſix days, and reſting the ſeventh, and bleſſing and hallowing it, was to be of general uſe in determining this matter, and that it is written, that the practice of mankind in general might ſome way or other be regulated by it. What could be the meaning of GOD'S reſting the ſeventh day, and hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bleſſing it, which he did, before the giving of the fourth commandment; unleſs he hallowed and bleſſed it with reſpect to mankind? For, he did not bleſs and ſanctify it with reſpect to himſelf, or that he himſelf and within himſelf might obſerve it: as
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:016767_0227_0F9E191AA6FAD608"/>
that is moſt abſurd. And it is unreaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that he hallowed it only with reſpect to the Jews, a particular nation, which roſe up above two thouſand years after.</p>
            <p>SO much therefore muſt be intended by it, that it was his mind, that mankind ſhould, after his example, work ſix days, and then reſt, and hallow or ſanctify the next following; and that they ſhould ſanctify e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſeventh day, or that the ſpace between reſt and reſt, one hallowed time and another, among his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures here upon earth, ſhould be ſix days.—So that it hence appears to be the mind and will of GOD, that not only the Jews, but men in all nations and ages, ſhould ſanctify one day in ſeven: which is the thing we are endeavouring to prove.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE mind of GOD in this matter is clearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the fourth commandment. The will of GOD is there revealed, not only that the Iſraelitiſh nation, but that all nations, ſhould keep every ſeventh day holy; or, which is the ſame thing, one day after every ſix. This command, as well as the reſt, is doubtleſs everlaſting and of perpetual obligation, at leaſt, as to the ſubſtance of it, as is intimated by its being engraven on the tables of ſtone. Nor is it to be thought that CHRIST ever aboliſhed any command of the ten; but that there is the complete number <hi>ten</hi> yet, and will be to the end of the world.</p>
            <p>SOME ſay, that the fourth command is perpetual, but not in its literal ſenſe, not as deſigning any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular proportion of time to be ſet apart and devoted to literal reſt and religious exerciſes. They ſay, that it is aboliſhed in that ſenſe, and ſtands in force only in a myſtical ſenſe, <abbr>viz.</abbr> as that weekly reſt of the Jews typified ſpiritual reſt in the Chriſtian church. And ſo, they ſay, that we under the goſpel are not
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:016767_0228_0F9E191B62AE1128"/>
to make any diſtinction of one day from another, but are to keep all time holy, doing every thing in a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual manner.</p>
            <p>BUT this is an abſurd way of interpreting the command, as it refers to Chriſtians. For if the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand be ſo far aboliſhed, it is entirely aboliſhed. For it is the very deſign of the command, to fix the time of worſhip. The firſt command fixes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the ſecond the means, the third the manner, the fourth the time. And, if it ſtands in force how only as ſignifying a ſpiritual, Chriſtian reſt, and holy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour at all times, it doth not remain as one of the ten commands, but as a ſummary of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>THE main <hi>objection</hi> againſt the perpetuity of this command is, that the duty required is not <hi>moral.</hi> Thoſe laws whoſe obligation ariſes from the nature of things, and from the general ſtate and nature of mankind, as well as from GOD'S poſitive revealed will, are called <hi>moral</hi> laws. Others, whoſe obligation depends merely upon GOD'S poſitive and arbitrary inſtitution, are not moral; ſuch as the ceremonial laws, and the precepts of the goſpel, about the two ſacraments. Now, the objectors ſay, they will allow all that is moral in the decalogue to be of perpetual obligation. But this command, they ſay, is not moral.</p>
            <p>BUT this objection is weak and inſufficient for the purpoſe, for which it is brought, or to prove that the fourth command, as to the ſubſtance of it, is not of perpetual obligation. For,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) If it ſhould be allowed that there is no mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity belonging to the command, and that the duty required, is founded merely on arbitrary inſtitution, it cannot therefore be certainly concluded, that the
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:016767_0229_0F9E191C52AF2460"/>
command is not perpetual. We know that there may be commands in force under the goſpel, and to the end of the world, which are not moral: ſuch are the inſtitutions of the two ſacraments. And why may there not be poſitive commands in force, in all ages of the church? If poſitive, arbitrary inſtitutions are in force in goſpel times, what is there which concludes, that no poſitive precept, given before the times of the goſpel, can yet continue in force? But,</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) As we have obſerved already, the thing in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, that there ſhould be certain fixed parts of time, ſet apart to be devoted to religious exerciſes, is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the fitneſs of the thing, ariſing from the nature of things, and the nature and univerſal ſtate of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Therefore, there is as much reaſon that there ſhould be a command of perpetual and univerſal o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bligation about this, as about any other duty what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. For if the thing in general, that there be a time fixed, be founded in the nature of things, there is conſequent upon it a neceſſity, that the time be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited by a command. For there muſt be a propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time fixed, or elſe the general moral duty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) THE particular determination of the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of time in the fourth commandment, is alſo founded in the nature of things, only our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings are not ſufficient abſolutely to determine i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of themſelves. We have obſerved already, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt one proportion of time is in itſelf fitter than another, and a certain continuance of time fitter than any other, conſidering the univerſal ſtate and nature of mankind; which GOD may ſee, though our underſtandings are not perfect enough abſolutely to determine it. So that the difference between this command and others, doth not lie in this, that other
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:016767_0230_0F9E191CE8B2A7C8"/>
commands are founded in the fitneſs of, the things themſelves, ariſing from the univerſal ſtate and nature of mankind, and this not: but only in this, that the fitneſs of other commands is more obvious to the underſtandings of men, and they might have ſeen it of themſelves; but this could not be preciſely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered and poſitively determined without the aſſiſtance of revelation.</p>
            <p>SO that the command of GOD, that every ſeventh day ſhould be devoted to religious exerciſes, is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the univerſal ſtate and nature of mankind, as well as other commands; only man's reaſon is not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, without divine direction, ſo exactly to determine it: Though perhaps man's reaſon is ſufficient to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine, that it ought not to be much ſeldomer, nor much oftener than once in ſeven days.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IT further confirms it, that it is the mind and will of GOD, that ſuch a weekly ſabbath ſhould for ever be kept, that GOD appears in his word as laying abundantly more weight on this precept concerning the ſabbath, than on any precept of the ceremonial law; not only by inſerting it in the decalogue, and making it one of the ten commands, which were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by GOD with an audible voice, by writing it with his own finger on the tables of ſtone, which were the work of GOD in the mount, and by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it afterwards to be written on the tables which Moſes made: but as the keeping of the weekly ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is ſpoken of by the prophets, as that wherein conſiſts a great part of holineſs of life; and as it is inſerted among moral duties, as particularly in Iſa. lviii. 13, 14. <q>If thou turn away thy foot from the ſabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day, and call the ſabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, honorable, and ſhalt honor him, not do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:016767_0231_0F9E19233079AEE8"/>
thine own ways, nor finding thine own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, nor ſpeaking thine own words: then ſhalt thou delight thyſelf in the LORD, and I will cauſe thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father; for the mouth of the LORD hath ſpoken it.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. IT is foretold, that this command ſhould be obſerved in goſpel times; as in Iſai. lvi. at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, where the due obſervation of the ſabbath is ſpoken of as a great part of holineſs of life, and is placed among moral duties. It is alſo mentioned as a duty that ſhould be moſt acceptable to GOD from his people, even where the prophet is ſpeaking of goſpel times; as in the foregoing chapter, and in the firſt verſe of this chapter. And, in the 3d and 4th verſes, the prophet is ſpeaking of the abolition of the ceremonial law in goſpel times, and particularly of that law, which forbids eunuchs to come into the congregation of the LORD. Yet, here the men is pronounced <hi>bleſſed, who keeps the ſabbath from polluting it,</hi> ver. 2. And even in the very ſentence where the eunuchs are ſpoken of as being free from the ceremonial law, they are ſpoken of as being yet under obligation to keep the ſabbath, and their keeping of it, as that which God lays great weight upon: <q>For, thus ſaith the LORD, unto the eunuchs that keep my ſabbaths, and chooſe the things that pleaſe me, and take hold of my covenant; even unto them will I give in mine houſe, and within my walls, a place and a name, better than of ſons and of daughters: I will give them an everlaſting name, that ſhall not be cut off.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BESIDES, the ſtrangers ſpoken of in the 6th and 7th verſe, are the Gentiles, that ſhould be called in the times of the goſpel, as is evident by the laſt clauſe
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:016767_0232_0F9E19247431C930"/>
in the 7th, and by the 8th verſe; <q>For mine houſe ſhall be called an houſe of prayer <hi>for all people.</hi> The LORD GOD which gathereth the outcaſts of Iſrael, ſaith, Yet will I gather <hi>others</hi> to him, <hi>beſides thoſe that are gathered unto him.</hi>
               </q> Yet it is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented here as <hi>their</hi> duty to keep the ſabbath: <q>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the <hi>ſons of the ſtranger,</hi> that join themſelves to the LORD, to ſerve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be his ſervants, <hi>every one that keepeth the ſabbath from polluting it,</hi> and taketh hold of my covenant: even <hi>them will I bring</hi> to my holy mountain, and <hi>make them joyful in my houſe of prayer.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. A FURTHER argument for the perpetuity of the ſabbath, we have in Matth. xxiv. 20. <q>Pray ye that your flight be not in the winter, <hi>neither on the ſabbath day.</hi>
               </q> CHRIST is here ſpeaking of the flight of the apoſtles and other chriſtians out of Jeruſalem and Judea, juſt before their final deſtruction, as is manifeſt by the whole context, and eſpecially by the 16th verſe: <q>Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains.</q> But this final deſtruction of Jeruſalem was after the diſſolution of the Jewiſh conſtitution, and after the chriſtian diſpenſation was fully ſet up. Yet, it is plainly implied in theſe words of our LORD, that even then chriſtians were bound to a ſtrict obſervation of the ſabbath.</p>

1. THE words of the fourth commandment af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford no objection againſt this being the day that ſhould be the ſabbath, any more than againſt any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day. That this day, which, according to the Jewiſh reckoning, is the firſt of the week, ſhould be kept as a ſabbath, is no more oppoſite to any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence or word of the fourth command, than that the ſeventh of the week ſhould be the day: and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the words of the fourth command do not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine which day of the week we ſhould keep as a ſabbath; they meerly determine this, that we ſhould reſt and keep as a ſabbath every ſeventh day, or one day after every ſix. It ſays, <hi>Six days thou ſhalt labour, and the ſeventh thou ſhalt reſt:</hi> which implies no more, than that after ſix days of labour, we ſhall, upon the next to the ſixth, reſt and keep it holy. And ſo, to be ſure, we are obliged to do for ever. But the words no way determine where thoſe ſix days ſhall begin, and ſo where the reſt or ſabbath ſhall fall. There is no direction in the fourth command how to reckon the time, <hi>i. e.</hi> where to begin and end it. That is not meddled with in the fourth command, but is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be determined otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>THE Jews did not know, by the fourth command, where to begin their ſix days, and on which particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar day to reſt; this was determined by another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept. The fourth command does indeed ſuppoſe a particular day appointed; but it does not appoint any. It requires us to reſt and keep holy a ſeventh day, one after every ſix of labour, which particular day GOD either had or ſhould appoint. The parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular day was determined for that nation in another place, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> in Exod. xvi. 23, 25, 26. <q>And he ſaid, unto them, This is that which the LORD hath ſaid, <hi>To morrow</hi> is the reſt of the holy ſabbath unto the
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:016767_0235_0F9E1926A363DC38"/>
LORD: bake that which ye will bake to day, and ſeethe that ye will ſeethe; and that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning.—And Moſes ſaid, Eat that to day; for <hi>to day is a ſabbath unto the Lord:</hi> to-day ye ſhall not find it in the field. Six days ye ſhall gather it; but <hi>the ſeventh day, which is the ſabbath,</hi> in it there ſhall be none.</q> This is the firſt place where we have any mention made of the ſabbath, from the firſt ſabbath on which GOD reſted.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems, that the Iſraelites, in the time of their bondage in Egypt, had loſt the true reckoning of time, by the days of the week reckoning from the firſt day of the creation; if it had been kept up till that time. They were ſlaves and in cruel bondage, and had in a great meaſure forgotten the true religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we are told, that they ſerved the gods of Egypt. And it is not to be ſuppoſed, that the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians would ſuffer their ſlaves to reſt from their work every ſeventh day. Now, they having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in bondage for ſo long a time, had probably loſt the weekly reckoning; therefore, when GOD had brought them out of Egypt into the wilderneſs, he made known to them the ſabbath, on the occaſion, and in the manner recorded in the text juſt now quoted. Hence, we read in Nehemiah, that when GOD had led the children of Iſrael out of Egypt, &amp;c. he made known unto them his holy ſabbath; Neh. ix. 14. <q>And madeſt known unto them thy holy ſabbath.</q> To the ſame effect we read in Ezek. xx. 10, 12. <q>Wherefore, I cauſed them to go forth out of the land of Egypt, and brought them into the wilderneſs. Moreover alſo, I gave them my ſabbaths.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT they never would have known where the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:016767_0236_0F9E1928189359F0"/>
day would have fallen, by the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Indeed, the fourth command, as it was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to the Jews, did refer to their Jewiſh ſabbath. But that doth not prove, that that day was determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and appointed by it. The precept in the fourth command is to be taken generally of a ſeventh day, ſuch a ſeventh day as GOD ſhould appoint, or had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. And becauſe ſuch a particular day had been already appointed for the Jewiſh church; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as it was ſpoken to them, it did refer to that particular day. But this doth not prove, but that the ſame words refer to another appointed ſeventh day, now in the chriſtian church. The words of the fourth command may oblige the church, under dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent diſpenſations, to obſerve different appointed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth days, as well as the fifth command may oblige different perſons to honor different fathers and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>THE chriſtian ſabbath, in the ſenſe of the fourth command, is as much the ſeventh day, as the Jewiſh ſabbath; becauſe, it is kept every ſeventh day, as much as that; it is kept after ſix days of labour, as well as that; it is the ſeventh, reckoning from the beginning of our firſt working day, as well as that was the ſeventh from the beginning of their firſt working day. All the difference is, that the ſeven days formerly began from the day after God's reſt from the creation, and now they begin the day after that. It is no matter by what names the days are called: if our nation had, for inſtance, called Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday the firſt of the week, it would have been all one as to this argument.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE, by the inſtitution of the chriſtian ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, there is no change from the fourth command; but the change is from another law, which determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:016767_0237_0F9E19282EAFEF50"/>
the beginning and ending of their working days. So that thoſe words of the fourth command <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>Six days ſhalt thou labour and do all thy work; but the ſeventh day is the ſabbath of the LORD thy GOD;</q> afford no objection againſt that which is called the chriſtian ſabbath; for theſe words remain in full force ſtill. Neither does any juſt objection ariſe from theſe words following, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <q>For in ſix days the LORD made heaven and earth, the ſea, and all that in them is, and reſted the ſeventh day: wherefore the LORD bleſſed the ſabbath day and and hallowed it.</q> Theſe words are not made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignificant to chriſtians, by the inſtitution of the chriſtian ſabbath: they ſtill remain in their full force as to that which is principally intended by them. They were deſigned to give us a reaſon why we are to work but ſix days at a time, and then reſt on the ſeventh, becauſe GOD hath ſet us the example. And taken ſo, they remain ſtill in as much force as ever they were. This is the reaſon ſtill, as much as ever it was, why we may work but ſix days at a time. What is the reaſon that chriſtians reſt every ſeventh, and not every eighth, or every ninth, or tenth day? It is becauſe GOD worked ſix days and reſted the ſeventh.</p>
            <p>IT is true, theſe words did carry ſomething further in their meaning, as they were ſpoken to the Jews, and to the church before the coming of CHRIST: it was then alſo intended by them, that the ſeventh day was to be kept in commemoration of the work of creation. But this is no objection to the ſuppoſition, that the words, as they relate to us, do not import all that they did, as they related to the Jews. For there are other words which were written upon thoſe tables of ſtone, with the ten commandments, which are
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:016767_0238_0F9E1928E0E3D0A8"/>
known and allowed not to be of the ſame import, as they relate to us, which they were of, as they related to the Jews, <abbr>viz.</abbr> theſe words in the preface to the ten commands, <q>I am the LORD thy GOD which brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage.</q>—Theſe words were written on the tables of ſtone with the reſt, and theſe words are ſpoken to us, as well as to the Jews: they are ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to all, to whom the commandments themſelves are ſpoken, for they are ſpoken as an enforcement of the commandments. But they do not now remain in all the ſignification, which they had as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the Jews. For we never were brought out of Egypt, out of the houſe of bondage, except in a myſtical ſenſe.—The ſame may be ſaid of thoſe words which are inſerted in the commandments them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, Deut. v. 15. <q>And remember that thou waſt a ſervant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy GOD brought thee out thence through a mighty hand, and a ſtretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy GOD commanded thee to keep the ſabbath day.</q>
            </p>
            <p>So that all the arguments of thoſe, who are againſt the chriſtian ſabbath drawn from the fourth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which are all their ſtrength, come to nothing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THAT he antient church was commanded to keep a ſeventh day in commemoration of the work of creation, is an argument for the keeping of a weekly ſabbath in commemoration of the work of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not any reaſon againſt it.</p>

            <p>THE ſcriptures teach us to look upon the old crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as deſtroyed, and as it were annihilated by ſin; or, as being reduced to a chaos again, without form and void, as it was at firſt. Jerem. iv. 22, 23. <q>They are wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge. And I beheld the earth, and low it was without form and void; and the heavens, and they had no light:</q>

            <p n="3">3. THERE is another thing which confirms it, that the fourth command reaches GOD'S reſting from the new creation, as well as from the old; which is, that the ſcriptures do expreſsly ſpeak of the one, as parallel with the other, <hi>i. e.</hi> CHRIST'S reſting from the work of redemption, as expreſsly ſpoken of as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parallel with God's reſting from the work of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as in Heb. iv 10. <q>For he that is entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his reſt, he alſo hath ceaſed from his own works, as GOD did from his.</q>

            <p n="1">(1.) WE are taught by them to look upon CHRIST'S reſt from his work of redemption, as paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with GOD'S reſt from the work of creation, for they are expreſsly compared together, as parallel one with the other:</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) THEY are ſpoken of as parallel, particularly in this reſpect, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> The relation which they both have to the keeping of a ſabbath among GOD'S peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, or with reſpect to the influence which theſe two reſts have, as to <hi>ſabbatizing</hi> in the church of GOD: for it is expreſsly with reſpect to this, that they are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared together. Here is an evident reference to GOD'S bleſſing and hallowing the day of his reſt from the the creation to be a ſabbath, and appointing a ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath of reſt in imitation of him. For the apoſtle is ſpeaking of this, ver 4. <q>For he ſpake in a certain place of the ſeventh day on this wiſe, And GOD did reſt the ſeventh day from all his works.</q> Thus far is evident; whatever the apoſtle has reſpect to by this keeping of a ſabbath by the people of GOD, whether it be a weekly ſabbatizing on earth, or a ſabbatizing in heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">(3.) IT is evident, in theſe words, that the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is given to the latter reſt, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>

reſt from the work of creation, doth not remain, but ceaſes; and that this new reſt, in commemoration of CHRIST'S reſting from his works, remains in the room of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE Holy Ghoſt hath implicitly told us, that the ſabbath which was inſtituted in commemoration of the old creation, ſhould not be kept in goſpel times, in Iſai. lxv. 17, 18. There we are told, that when GOD ſhould create new heavens and a new earth, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>LET us underſtand this which way we will, it will not be well conſiſtent with the keeping of one day in ſeven, in the goſpel church, principally for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance and calling to mind of the old creation. If the meaning of the place be only this, that the old creation ſhall not be remembered nor come into mind in compariſon with the new, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For then hereby the Holy Ghoſt teaches us, that the chriſtian church has much more reaſon to commemorate the new creation than the old; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the old is worthy to be forgotten in compariſon with it.</p>
            <p>AND, as the old creation was no more to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, nor come into mind, ſo in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="5">5. IT is an argument that the Jewiſh ſabbath was not to be perpetual, that the Jews were commanded to keep it in remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt. One reaſon why it was inſtituted was, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe GOD thus delivered them, as we are expreſsly told in the decalogue itſelf, in one of the places where we have it recorded in the books of Moſes; Deut. v. 15. <q>And remember that thou waſt a ſervant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy GOD brought thee out thence, through a mighty hand, and by a ſtretched out a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="6">6. THE Holy Ghoſt hath implicitly told us, that inſtituted memorials of the Jews deliverance from Egypt ſhould be no longer upheld in goſpel times, as in Iſai xvi. 14, 15.

            <p>IF there be a ſabbath kept up in goſpel times, as we have ſhown there muſt be, it is more juſt from theſe words to ſuppoſe that it ſhould be as a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of that which is ſpoken of in the latter verſe, <hi>the bringing up of the children of Iſrael from the land of the north;</hi> that is, the redemption of CHRIST, and his bringing home the elect, not only from Jud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="7">7. IT is no more than juſt to ſuppoſe, that GOD intended to intimate to us, that the ſabbath ought by chriſtians to be kept in commemoration of CHRIST'S redemption, in that the Iſraelites were commanded to keep it in remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt; becauſe, that deliverance out of Egypt is an evident, known and allowed type of it. It was contrived and ordered of GOD, on purpoſe to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it; every thing about that deliverance was typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal of this redemption, and much is made of it prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for this reaſon, becauſe it is ſo remarkable a type of CHRIST'S redemption. And it was but a ſhadow, the work in itſelf, was nothing in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the work of redemption. What is a petty redemption of one nation from a temporal bondage, to the eternal ſalvation of the whole church of the elect in all ages and nations, from eternal damnation, and the introduction of them, not into a temporal Canaan, but into heaven, into eternal glory and bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs? Was that ſhadow ſo much to be comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morated, as that a day once a week, was to be kept on the account of it; and ſhall not we much more commemorate that great and glorious work, of which it was deſigned on purpoſe to be a ſhadow?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="unknown:016767_0245_0F9E1934E744B430"/>
BESIDES, the words in the fourth commandment, which ſpeak of the deliverance out of Egypt, can be of no ſignificancy unto us, unleſs they are to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted of the goſpel redemption: but the words of the decalogue are ſpoken to all nations and ages. Therefore, as the words were ſpoken to the Jews they referred to the type or ſhadow; as they are ſpoken to us they are to be interpreted of the antitype and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. For the Egypt from which we under the goſpel are redeemed, is the ſpiritual Egypt; the houſe of bondage from which we are redeemed, is a ſtate of ſpiritual bondage.—Therefore the words as ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to us, are to be thus interpreted, Remember, thou waſt a ſervant to ſin and ſatan, and the LORD thy GOD delivered thee from this bondage with a mighty hand and outſtretched arm; therefore the LORD thy GOD commanded thee to keep the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day.</p>
            <p>As the words in the preface to the ten command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, about the bringing of the children of Iſrael out of Egypt, are interpreted in our catechiſm, and as they have reſpect to us, muſt be interpreted of our ſpiritual redemption, ſo by an exact identity of reaſon, muſt theſe words in Deuteronomy, annexed to the fourth command be interpreted of the ſame goſpel redemption.</p>
            <p>THE Jewiſh ſabbath was kept on the day that the children of Iſrael came up out of the red ſea. For, we are told in Deut. v. 15. That this holy reſt of the ſabbath was appointed in commemoration of their coming up out of Egypt. But the day of their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing through the red ſea was the day of their coming up out of Egypt; for till then they were in the land of Egypt. The red ſea was the boundary of the land of Egypt.—The ſcripture itſelf tells us that
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:016767_0246_0F9E1936E2345130"/>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hat day on which they ſong the ſong of Moſes, was the day of their coming up out of the land of Egypt; Hoſea ii. 15. <q>And ſhe ſhall ſing there, as in the days of her youth, as in the day when ſhe came up out of the land of Egypt;</q> referring plainly to that triumphant ſong which Moſes and the children of Iſrael ſang, when they came up out of the red ſea.</p>
            <p>THE ſcripture tells us, that GOD appointed the Jewiſh ſabbath in commemoration of the deliverance of the children of Iſrael from their taſk maſters, the Egyptians, and of their reſt from their hard bondage and ſlavery under them; Deut. v. 14, 15. <q>That thy man ſervant and maid ſervant may reſt as well as thou. And remember that thou waſt a ſervant in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD thy GOD brought thee out thence through a mighty hand, and by a ſtretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy GOD commanded thee to keep the ſabbath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.</q>—But the day that the children of Iſrael were delivered from their taſk-maſters and had reſt from them, was the day when the children of Iſrael came up out of the red ſea. They had no reſt from them till then. For though they were before come forth on their journey to go out of the land of Egypt; yet they were purſued by the Egyptians, and were exceedingly perplexed and diſtreſſed. But on the morning that they came up out of the red ſea, they had compleat and final deliverance; then they had full reſt from their taſk-maſters. Then GOD ſaid to them, <q>The Egyptians which ye have ſeen this day ye ſhall ſee no more for ever;</q> Exod. xiv. 13. Then they enjoyed a joyful day of reſt, a day of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment. Then they ſang the ſong of Moſes; and on that day was their ſabbath of reſt.</p>
            <p>BUT this coming up of the children of Iſrael out
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:016767_0247_0F9E193735726B38"/>
of the red ſea, was only a type of the reſurrection of CHRIST. That people was the myſtical body of CHRIST, and Moſes was a great type of CHRIST him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and beſides, on that day CHRIST went before the children of Iſrael in the pillar of cloud and of fire, as their Saviour and Redeemer. On that morning CHRIST, in this pillar of cloud and fire, roſe out of the red ſea, as out of great waters; which was a type of CHRIST'S riſing from a ſtate of death and from that great humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation which he ſuffered in death.</p>
            <p>THE reſurrection of CHRIST from the dead, is in ſcripture repreſented by his coming up out of deep waters. So it is in CHRIST'S reſurrection as repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by Jonah's coming out of the ſea; Mat. xii. 40. It is alſo compared to a deliverance out of deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in Pſalm lxix. 1, 2, 3, and ver. 14, 15.—Theſe things are ſpoken of CHRIST, as is evident from this, that many things in this Pſalm are in the new teſtament expreſsly applied to CHRIST, as you may ſee by comparing ver. 4. with Joh. xv. 25. and ver. 9. with Joh. ii. 17. and ver. 2. with Matth. xxvii. 34, 48. and Mark xv. 23. and Joh. xix. 29. and ver. 22. with Rom. xi. 9, 10. and ver. 25. with Acts i. 20.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE it being ſo, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> the Jewiſh ſabbath was appointed on the day on which the pillar of cloud and fire roſe out of the red ſea, and on which Moſes and the church, the myſtical body of CHRIST came up out of the ſame ſea, which is a type of the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of CHRIST; it is a great confirmation that the chriſtian ſabbath ſhould be kept on the day of the riſing of the real body of CHRIST from the grave, which is the antitype.

8. I ARGUE the ſame thing from Pſalm cxviii. 22, 23, 24. There we are taught, that the day of CHRIST'S reſurrection is to be celebrated with holy joy by the church. <q>The ſtone which the builders refuſed, is become the head ſtone of the corner. This is the LORD'S doing it is marvellous in our eyes. This is the day which the LORD hath made, we will rejoice and be glad in it.</q> The ſtone ſpoken of is CHRIST; he was refuſed and rejected by the builders, eſpecially when he was put to death. That making of him the head of the corner ſpoken of, which is the LORD'S doing, and ſo marvellous in our eyes, is CHRIST'S exaltation, which began with his reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. While CHRIST lay in the grave, be lay as a ſtone caſt away by the builders. But when GOD raiſed him from the dead, then he became the head of the corner. Thus it is evident the apoſtle inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets it, Acts iv. 10, 11. <q>Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Iſrael, that by the name of JESUS of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom GOD raiſed from the dead,</q> &amp;c.—<q>This is the ſtone which was ſet at nought by you build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which is become the head of the corner.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND the day on which this was done, we are here taught, that GOD hath made to be the day of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing of the church.</p>
            <p n="9">9. THE abolition of the Jewiſh ſabbath ſeems to be intimated by this, that CHRIST, the LORD of the ſabbath, lay buried on that day. CHRIST, the author of the world, was the author of that work of creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of which the Jewiſh ſabbath was the memorial. It was he that worked ſix days and reſted the ſeventh day from all his works, and was refreſhed. Yet he was holden in the chains of death on that day.—GOD who created the world, now in his ſecond work
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:016767_0249_0F9E1938F2B86000"/>
of creation, did not follow his own example, if I may ſo ſpeak; he did not reſt on the ſame day, but remained impriſoned in the grave on that day, and took another day to reſt in.</p>
            <p>THE ſabbath was a day of rejoicing; for it was kept in commemoration of GOD'S glorious and graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous works of creation and the redemption out of Egypt. Therefore we are directed to call the ſabbath a delight. But it is not a proper day for the church, CHRIST'S ſpouſe to rejoice, when CHRIST the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom lies buried in the grave, as CHRIST ſays, Mat. ix. 15. <q>That the children of the bride cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber cannot mourn, while the bridegroom is with them. But the time will come when the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom ſhall be taken from them; then ſhall they mourn.</q>—While CHRIST was holden under the chains of death; then the bridegroom was taken from them; then it was a proper time for the ſpouſe to mourn and not rejoice. But when CHRIST roſe again, then it was a day of joy, becauſe we are begotten a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to a living hope, by the reſurrection of JESUS CHRIST from the dead.</p>
            <p n="10">10. CHRIST hath evidently, on purpoſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, peculiarly honored the firſt day of the week, the day on which he roſe from the dead, by taking this day of the week from time to time to appear to the apoſtles, and by taking this day to pour out the Holy Ghoſt on the apoſtles, which we read of in the ſecond chapter of Acts: for this was on the firſt day of the week, being on Pentecoſt, which was on the firſt day of the week, as you may ſee by Levit. xxiii. 15, 16. And by pouring out his ſpirit on the apoſtle John, and giving him his viſions on this day; Rev. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

            <p>How doubtleſs CHRIST had his meaning in thus diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

11. IT is evident by the new teſtament, that this was eſpecially the day of the public worſhip of the primitive church, by the direction of the apoſtles. We are told that this was the day that they were wont to come together to break bread: and this they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently did with the approbation of the apoſtles, in as much as they preached to them on that day; and therefore doubtleſs they aſſembled together by the direction of the apoſtles. Acts xx. 7. <q>And upon the firſt day of the week, when the diſciples came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them.</q>—So the Holy Ghoſt was careful that the public contributions ſhould be on this day, in all the churches, rather than on any other day, as appears by our text.</p>
            <p n="12">12. THIS firſt day of the week is in the new teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament called <hi>the Lord's day;</hi> ſee Rev. i. 10.—Some ſay, how do we know that that was the firſt day of the week? Every day is the LORD'S day. But it is ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous ſo to talk. For the deſign of John is to tell us, when he had thoſe viſions. And if by the LORD'S day is meant any day, how doth that inform us when that event took place?</p>
            <p>BUT what is meant by this expreſſion we know, juſt in the ſame way as we know what is the meaning of any word in the original of the new teſtament, or the meaning of any expreſſion in an antient language; <abbr>viz.</abbr> by what we find to be the univerſal ſignification of the expreſſion in antient times. This expreſſion of <hi>the Lord's day</hi> is found by the antient uſe of the whole chriſtian church, by what appears in all the writings of antient times, even from the apoſtles days, to ſignify the firſt day of the week.</p>
            <p>AND the expreſſion implies in it the holineſs of the day. For doubtleſs the day is called, <hi>the Lord's day,</hi>
               <pb n="255" facs="unknown:016767_0251_0F9E193AB78F2CD0"/>
as the ſacred ſupper is called <hi>the Lord's ſupper,</hi> which is ſo called, becauſe it is an holy ſupper, to be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in remembrance of the LORD CHRIST, and of his redemption. So this is an holy day to be kept in remembrance of the LORD CHRIST and his redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>THE firſt day of the week being in ſcripture called the LORD'S day, ſufficiently makes it out to be the day of the week that is to be kept holy unto GOD; for GOD hath been pleaſed to call it by his own name. When GOD puts his name upon any thing, or any thing is called by the name of GOD in ſcripture, this denotes the buſineſs of that thing and the appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it to GOD.—Thus GOD put his name upon his people Iſrael, of old; Num. vi. 27. <q>And they ſhall put my name upon the children of Iſrael.</q> They were called by the name of GOD, as it is ſaid, 2 Chron. vii. 14. <q>If my people which are <hi>called by my name,</hi> &amp;c.</q> 
               <hi>i. e.</hi> They were called GOD'S people, or the LORD'S people. This denoted that they were an holy, peculiar people above all others. Deut. vii. 6. <q>Thou art an holy people unto the LORD;</q> and ſo in ver. 14. and many other places.</p>
            <p>So the city Jeruſalem was a city that was called by GOD'S name; Jer. xxv. 29.—<q>Upon the city which is called by my name.</q> Dan. ix. 18, 19. <q>And the city which is called by thy name, &amp;c.</q> This denoted that that was an holy city, a city cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen of GOD above all other cities for holy uſes, as it is often called <hi>the holy city,</hi> as in Nehem. xi. 1. <q>To dwell in Jeruſalem the holy city;</q> and in many other places.</p>
            <p>So the temple is ſaid to be an houſe called by GOD'S name; I Kings viii. 43. <q>This houſe that is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by my name.</q> And often elſe where. That is,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:016767_0252_0F9E193AE1006510"/>
it was called GOD'S houſe, or the LORD'S houſe. This denoted that it was called an holy place, an houſe devoted to holy uſes above all others.</p>
            <p>So alſo we find that the firſt day of the week is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by GOD'S name, being called in ſcripture GOD'S day, or <hi>the Lord's day,</hi> which denotes that it is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day, a day appropriated to holy uſes, above all others in the week.</p>
            <p n="13">13. THE tradition of the church from age to age, though it be no rule, yet may be a great confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the truth in ſuch a caſe as this is. We find, by all accounts that it hath been the univerſal cuſtom of the chriſtian church, in all ages, even from the age of the apoſtles, to keep the firſt day of the week. We read in the writings which remain of the firſt, ſecond, and third centuries of the chriſtians keeping the LORD'S day; and ſo in all ſucceeding ages: and there are no accounts that contradict them.—This day hath all along been kept by chriſtians, in all countries throughout the world, and by almoſt all that have borne the name of chriſtians, of all denominations, however different in their opinions as to other things.</p>
            <p>NOW, although this be not ſufficient of itſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a foundation in ſcripture; yet it may be a confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of it, becauſe here is really matter of convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it to our reaſon. Reaſon may greatly confirm truths revealed in the ſcriptures. The univerſality of the cuſtom throughout all chriſtian countries, in all ages, by what account we have of them, is a good argument, that the church had it from the apoſtles; and it is difficult to conceive how all ſhould come to agree, to ſet up ſuch a cuſtom through the world, of different ſects and opinions, and we have no account of any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p n="14">14. IT is no way weakening to theſe arguments,
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:016767_0253_0F9E193E807CA240"/>
that there is nothing more plainly ſaid about it in the new teſtament, till John wrote his <hi>Revelation,</hi> becauſe there is a ſufficient reaſon to be given for it. In all probability it was purpoſely avoided by the Holy Spirit, in the firſt ſettling of chriſtian churches in the world, both among the heathen, and among the Jews, but eſpecially for the ſake of the Jews and out of tenderneſs to the Jewiſh chriſtians. For it is evident that CHRIST and the apoſtles declared one thing after another to them gradually as they could bear it.</p>
            <p>THE Jews had a regard for their ſabbath above al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt any thing in the law of Moſes, and there was that in the old teſtament which tended to uphold them in the obſervance of this, much more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, than any thing elſe that was Jewiſh. GOD had made ſo much of it, had ſo ſolemnly, frequently, and carefully commanded it, and had often ſo dreadfully puniſhed the breach of it, that their was more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour for their retaining this cuſtom, than almoſt any other.</p>
            <p>THEREFORE CHRIST dealt very tenderly with them in this point. Other things of this nature we find very gradually revealed. CHRIST had many things to ſay, as we are informed, which yet he ſaid not, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they could not as yet bear them, and gave this reaſon for it, that it was like putting new wine into old bottles. They were ſo contrary to their old cuſtoms, that CHRIST was gradual in revealing them. He gave here a little and there a little, as they could bear; and it was a long time before he told them plainly the principal doctrines of the kingdom of heaven.—He took the moſt favourable opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to tell them of his ſufferings and death, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they were full of admiration at ſome ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:016767_0254_0F9E193ED61A5EF8"/>
miracle, and were confirmed in it, that he was the Meſſiah.</p>
            <p>HE told them many things much more plainly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his reſurrection, than before. But even then, he did not tell them all, but left more to be revealed by the Holy Ghoſt at Pentecoſt. They therefore were much more enlightened after that, than before. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as yet he did not reveal all. The abolition of the ceremonial law about meats and drinks was not fully known, till after this.</p>
            <p>THE apoſtles were in the ſame manner careful and tender of thoſe, to whom they preached and wrote. It was very gradually that they ventured to teach them the ceſſation of the ceremonial laws of circumciſion and abſtinence from unclean meats. How tender is the apoſtle Paul with ſuch as ſcrupled, in the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth chapter of Romans? He directs thoſe who had knowledge to keep it to themſelves, for the ſake of their weak brethren. Rom. xiv. 22.—But I need ſay no more to evince this.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER, I will ſay this, that it is very poſſible that the apoſtles themſelves at firſt might not have this change of the day of the ſabbath fully revealed to them. The Holy Ghoſt, at his deſcent, revealed much to them, yet after that, they were ignorant of much of goſpel doctrine; yea, they were ſo a great while after they acted the part of apoſtles, in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, baptizing, and governing the church. Peter was ſurprized when he was commanded to eat meats legally unclean; and ſo were the apoſtles in general, when Peter was commanded to go to the Gentiles, to preach to them.</p>
            <p>THUS tender was CHRIST of the church, while an infant. He did not feed them with ſtrong meat, but was careful to bring in the obſervation of the LORD'S
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:016767_0255_0F9E194020E2E648"/>

day by degrees, and therefore took all occaſions to honor it, by appearing from time to time of choice on that day, by ſending down his ſpirit on that day in that remarkable manner at Pentecoſt; by ordering chriſtians to meet in order to break bread on that day, and by ordering their contributions and other duties of worſhip to be holden on it; thus introducing the obſervation of it by degrees.—And though as yet the Holy Ghoſt did not ſpeak very plainly about it, yet GOD took ſpecial care that there ſhould be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient evidences of his will, to be found out by the chriſtian church, when it ſhould be more eſtabliſhed and ſettled, and ſhould have come to the ſtrength of a man.</p>
            <p>THUS I leave it with every one to judge, whether there be not ſufficient evidence, that it is the mind and will of GOD, that the firſt day of the week ſhould be kept by the chriſtian church, as a ſabbath.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. LET us be thankful for the inſtitution of the chriſtian ſabbath. It is a thing wherein GOD hath
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:016767_0257_0F9E1941DB3CF238"/>
ſhown his mercy to us, and his care for our ſouls. He ſhows, that he, by his infinite wiſdom, is contriving for our good, as CHRIST teaches us, that the ſabbath was made for man; Mark ii. 27. <q>The ſabbath was made for man, and not man for the ſabbath.</q> It was made for the profit and for the comfort of our ſouls.</p>
               <p>THE ſabbath is a day of reſt: GOD hath appointed that we ſhould, every ſeventh day, reſt from all our worldly labours. Inſtead of that, he might have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the hardeſt labours for us to go through, ſome ſevere hardſhips for us to endure.—It is a day of outward, but eſpecially of ſpiritual reſt. It is a day appointed of GOD, that his people thereon may find reſt unto their ſouls; that the ſouls of believers may reſt and be refreſhed in their Saviour.—It is a day of rejoicing; GOD made it to be a joyful day to the church; Pſal. cxviii. 24. <q>This is the day which the LORD hath made, we will rejoice and be glad in it.</q> They that aright receive and improve the ſabbath, call it <hi>a delight</hi> and <hi>honorable;</hi> it is a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and a joyful day to them. It is an image of the future heavenly reſt of the church. Heb. iv. 9, 10, 11. "There remaineth therefore a reſt," (or ſabbatiſm as it is in the original) "to the people of GOD. For he that hath entered into his reſt, he alſo hath ceaſed from his own works, as GOD did from his. Let us labour therefore to enter into that reſt."</p>
               <p>THE chriſtian ſabbath is one of the moſt precious enjoyments of the viſible church. CHRIST ſhowed his love to his church in inſtituting it; and it becomes the chriſtian church to be thankful to her LORD for it. The very name of this day, <hi>the Lord's day,</hi> or <hi>Jeſus's day,</hi> ſhould endear it to chriſtians, as it inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the ſpecial relation it has to CHRIST, and alſo
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:016767_0258_0F9E1942E6DC97D8"/>
the deſign of it, which is the commemoration of our dear Saviour, and his love to his church in redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BE exhorted to keep this day holy.—GOD hath given ſuch evidences that this is his mind, that he will ſurely require it of you, if you do not ſtrictly and conſcientiouſly obſerve it. And if you do thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it, you may have this comfort in the reflection upon your conduct, that you have not been ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in it, but have done as GOD hath revealed it to be his mind and will in his word, that you ſhould do; and that in ſo doing you are in the way of GOD'S acceptance and reward.</p>
               <p>HERE let me lay before you the following <hi>motives</hi> to excite you to this duty.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) BY a ſtrict obſervation of the ſabbath, the name of GOD is honored, and that in ſuch a way as is very acceptable to him. Iſai. lviii. 13. <q>If thou call the ſabbath a delight, the holy of the LORD, and <hi>ſhalt honor him.</hi>
                  </q> GOD is honored by it, as it is a viſible manifeſtation of reſpect to GOD'S holy law, and a reverencing of that which has a peculiar relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to GOD himſelf, and that more in ſome reſpects than the obſervation of many other commands. A man may be juſt, and may be generous, and yet not ſo plainly ſhow reſpect to the revealed mind and will of GOD, as many of the heathen have been ſo. But if a perſon, with evident ſtrictneſs and care, obſerve the ſabbath, it is a viſible manifeſtation of a conſcientious regard to GOD's declaration of his mind, and ſo is a viſible honor done to his authority.</p>
               <p>BY a ſtrict obſervation of the ſabbath, the face of religion is kept up in the world. If it were not for the ſabbath, there would be but little public and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible appearance of ſerving, worſhipping and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rencing
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:016767_0259_0F9E1943287ADAA0"/>
the ſupreme and inviſible Being. The ſabbath ſeems to have been appointed very much for this end, <abbr>viz.</abbr> to uphold the viſibility of religion in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, or among profeſſing ſocieties of men; and by how much greater the ſtrictneſs is with which the ſabbath is obſerved, and with how much more ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity the duties of it are obſerved among a people; by ſo much the greater is the manifeſtation among them, of reſpect to the divine Being.</p>
               <p>THIS ſhould be a powerful motive with us to the obſervation of the ſabbath. It ſhould be our ſtudy above all things to honor and glorify GOD. It ſhould be the great thing with all that bear the name of chriſtians, to honor their great GOD and king, and I hope is a great thing with many that hear me at this time.—If this be your inquiry, if this be your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, to honor GOD; by this ſubject you are directed to one way whereby you may do much in that way, <abbr>viz.</abbr> by honoring the ſabbath, and by ſhowing a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſtrict obſervance of it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) THAT which is the buſineſs of the ſabbath is the greateſt buſineſs of our lives, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the buſineſs of religion. To ſerve and worſhip GOD is that for which we were made, and for which we had our being given us. Other buſineſs, which is of a ſecular na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and on which we are wont to attend on week days, is but ſubordinate, and ought to be ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to the higher purpoſes and ends of religion. Therefore ſurely we ſhould not think much of devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſeventh part of our time, to be wholely ſpent in this buſineſs, and to be ſet apart to exerciſe our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the immediate duties of religion.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) LET it be conſidered that all our time is GOD'S, and therefore when he challenges of us one day in ſeven, he challenges his own; he doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:016767_0260_0F9E1944030D6AF8"/>
his right; he would not have exceeded it, if he had challenged a far greater proportion of our time to be ſpent in his immediate ſervice. But he hath mercifully conſidered our ſtate, and our neceſſities here; and, as he hath conſulted the good of our ſouls, in appointing a ſeventh day for the immediate duties of religion; ſo he hath conſidered our outward neceſſities, and hath allowed us ſix days for attendance on our outward affairs.—What unworthy treatment there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will it be of GOD, if we refuſe to allow him even the ſeventh day!</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) As the ſabbath is a day which is eſpecially ſet apart for religious exerciſes, ſo it is a day where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in GOD eſpecially confers his grace and bleſſing.—As GOD hath commanded us to ſet it apart to have converſe with GOD, ſo GOD hath ſet it apart for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have converſe with us. As GOD hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to obſerve the ſabbath, ſo GOD obſerves the ſabbath too. It is with reſpect to the ſabbath, as Solomon prayed that it might be with reſpect to the temple, 2 Chron. vi. 20. His eyes are open upon it; he ſtands ready then eſpecially to hear prayers, to accept of religious ſervices, to meet his people, to manifeſt himſelf to them on this day, to give his holy ſpirit and bleſſing to thoſe who diligently and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly ſanctify it.</p>
               <p>THAT we ſhould ſanctify the ſabbath, as we have obſerved, is according to GOD'S inſtitution. GOD in a ſenſe obſerves his own inſtitutions; <hi>i. e.</hi> is wont to cauſe them to be attended with a bleſſing.—The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of GOD are his appointed means of grace, and with his inſtitutions he hath promiſed his bleſſing; Exod. xx. 24. <q>In all places where I record my name, I will come unto thee, and I will bleſs thee.</q> For the ſame reaſon may we conclude, that GOD will
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:016767_0261_0F9E1944B4E707A0"/>
meet his people and bleſs them, waiting upon him not only in appointed places, but at appointed times, and in all appointed ways. CHRIST hath promiſed that where two or three are gathered together in his name, he will be in the midſt of them, Mat. xviii. 20. One thing included in the expreſſion, <hi>in his name,</hi> is, that it is by his appointment, and according to his inſtitution.</p>
               <p>GOD hath made it our duty, by his inſtitution, to ſet apart this day for a ſpecial ſeeking of his grace and bleſſing. From which we may argue, that he will be eſpecially ready to confer his grace on thoſe who thus ſeek it. If it be the day on which GOD re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires us eſpecially to ſeek him, we may argue, that it is a day on which eſpecially he will be found. That GOD is ready on this day eſpecially to beſtow his bleſſing on them that keep it aright, is implied in that expreſſion of <hi>God's bleſſing the ſabbath day.</hi> GOD hath not only hallowed the ſabbath day, but bleſſed it; he hath given his bleſſing to it, and will confer his bleſſing upon all the due obſervers of it. He hath hallowed it, or appointed that it be kept holy by us, and hath bleſſed it; he hath determined to give his bleſſing upon it.</p>
               <p>SO that here is great encouragement for us to keep holy the ſabbath, as we would ſeek GOD'S grace and our own ſpiritual good. The ſabbath day is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time, a day of ſalvation, a time wherein GOD eſpecially loves to be ſought, and loves to be found. The LORD JESUS CHRIST takes delight in his own day; he delights to honor it; he delights to meet with and manifeſt himſelf to his diſciples on it, as he ſhowed before his aſcenſion, by appearing to them from time to time on this day. On this day he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to give his holy ſpirit, as he intimated by chooſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:016767_0262_0F9E19456468D8B8"/>
it as the day on which to pour out the ſpirit in ſo remarkable a manner on the primitive church, and on which to give his ſpirit to the apoſtle John.</p>
               <p>OF old GOD bleſſed the ſeventh day, or appointed it to be a day whereon eſpecially he would beſtow bleſſings on his people, as an expreſſion of his own joyful remembrance of that day, and of the teſt and refreſhment which he had on it. Exod. xxxi. 16, 17. <q>Wherefore the children of Iſrael ſhall keep the ſabbath.—For in ſix days the LORD made hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, and on the ſeventh he reſted and was refreſhed.</q> As princes give gifts on their birth days, on their marriage days, and the like; ſo GOD was wont to diſpenſe ſpiritual gifts on the ſeventh day.</p>
               <p>BUT how much more reaſon has CHRIST to bleſs the day of his reſurrection, and to delight to honor it, and to confer his grace and bleſſed gifts on his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, on this day. It was a day whereon CHRIST reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and was refreſhed in a literal ſenſe. It was a day of great refreſhment and joy to CHRIST, being the day of his deliverance from the chains of death, the day of his finiſhing that great and difficult work of redemption, which had been upon his heart from all eternity; the day of his juſtification by the Father; the day of the beginning of his exaltation, and of the fulfilment of the promiſes of the Father; the day when he had eternal life, which he had purchaſed, put into his hands.—On this day CHRIST doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed delight to diſtribute gifts, and bleſſings, and joy, and happineſs, and will delight to do the ſame to the end of the world.</p>
               <p>O THEREFORE, how well is it worth our while, to improve this day, to call upon GOD and ſeek JESUS CHRIST on it!—Let awakened ſinners be ſtirred up by theſe things, to improve the ſabbath day, as they
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:016767_0263_0F9E1946240E6860"/>
would lay themſelves moſt in the way of the ſpirit of GOD. Improve the ſabbath day to call upon GOD; for then he is near. Improve the ſabbath day for reading the holy ſcriptures, and diligently attending his wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d preached; for then is the likelieſt time to have the ſpirit accompanying it.—Let the ſaints who are deſirous of growing in grace, and enjoying com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with CHRIST, improve the ſabbath in order to it.</p>
               <p n="5">(5,) THE laſt motive which I ſhall mention, is the experience of the influence, which a ſtrict obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſabbath has upon the whole of religion. It may be obſerved, that in thoſe places where the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is well kept, religion in general will be moſt flouriſhing; and that in thoſe places where the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath is not much taken notice of, and much is not made of it, there is no great matter of religion any way.</p>
               <p>HERE I would give ſeveral DIRECTIONS in anſwer to this.</p>
               <p>INQUIRY. How ought we to keep the ſabbath?</p>
               <p>ANS. 1, WE ought to be exceedingly careful on this day to abſtain from ſin. Indeed, all breaches of the ſabbath are ſinful; but we ſpeak now of thoſe things which are in themſelves ſinful, or ſinful upon other accounts, beſides that they are done upon the ſabbath. The ſabbath being holy time, it is eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally defiled by the commiſſion of ſin. Sin by being committed on this day becomes the more exceeding ſinful. We are required to abſtain from ſin at all times, but eſpecially on holy time. The commiſſion of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralities on the ſabbath is the worſt way of profaning it, that which moſt provokes GOD, and brings moſt guilt upon the ſouls of men.</p>
               <p>HOW provoking muſt it be to GOD, when men do thoſe things on that day which GOD has ſanctified, and ſet a part to be ſpent in the immediate exerciſes
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:016767_0264_0F9E1946E0F992F8"/>
of religion, which are not fit to be done on common days, which are impure and wicked whenever they are done!</p>
               <p>THEREFORE if any perſons be guilty of any ſuch wickedneſs, as intemperance or any unclean actions, they do in a very horrid manner profane the ſabbath. Or if they be guilty of wickedneſs in ſpeech, of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profanely, or in an unclean and laſcivious manner, or of talking againſt their neighbours, they do in a dreadful manner profane the ſabbath.—Yet very commonly thoſe who are uſed to ſuch things on week days, have not a conſcience to reſtrain them on the ſabbath. It is well if thoſe that live in the indulgence of the luſt of uncleanneſs on week days, be not ſome way or other unclean on the ſabbath. They will be indulging the ſame luſts then; they will be indulging their impure flames in their imaginations at leaſt: and it is well if they keep clear while in the houſe of GOD, and while they pretend to be worſhipping GOD. The unclean young man gives this account of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, Prov. v. 14. <q>I was almoſt in all evil in the midſt of the congregation and the aſſembly.</q>—So thoſe who are addicted to an impure way of talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the week-time, have nothing to keep them from the ſame upon the ſabbath, when they meet together. But dreadfully is GOD provoked by ſuch things.</p>
               <p>WE ought carefully to watch over our own hearts, and to avoid all ſinful thoughts on the ſabbath. We ought to maintain ſuch a reverence for the ſabbath, as to have a peculiar dread of ſin, ſuch as ſhall awe us to a very careful watch over ourſelves.</p>
               <p n="2">2. WE ought to be careful to abſtain from all worldly concerns. The reaſon as we have ſhowed, why it is needful and proper, that certain ſtated parts of time ſhould be ſet apart to be devoted to religious
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:016767_0265_0F9E194A2DD035E0"/>
exerciſes, is becauſe the ſtate of mankind is ſuch in this world, that they are neceſſitated to exerciſe their minds, and employ their thoughts about ſecular mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. It is therefore convenient that their ſhould be ſtated times, wherein all ſhould be obliged to throw by all other concerns, that their minds may the more freely and with leſs entanglement, be engaged in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and ſpiritual exerciſes.</p>
               <p>WE are therefore to do thus, or elſe we fruſtrate the very deſign of the inſtitution of a ſabbath. We are ſtrictly to abſtain from being outwardly engaged in any worldly thing, either worldly buſineſs or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations. We are to reſt in remembrance of GOD'S reſt from the work of creation, and of CHRIST'S reſt from the work of redemption. We ſhould be careful that we do not encroach upon the ſabbath at its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, by buſying ourſelves about the world after the ſabbath is begun. We ſhould avoid talking a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout worldly matters, and even thinking about them; for whether we outwardly concern ourſelves with the world or not, yet if our minds be upon it, we fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the end of the ſabbath. The end of its ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from other days is, that our minds may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged from worldly things; and we are to avoid being outwardly concerned with the world only for this reaſon, that that cannot be without taking up our minds.—We ought therefore to give the world no place in our thoughts on the ſabbath, but to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract ourſelves from all worldly concernment, and maintain a watch over ourſelves, that the world do not encroach, as it is very apt to do. Iſa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. lviii. 13, 14.</p>
               <p n="3">3. WE ought to ſpend the time in religious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. This is the more ultimate end of the ſabbath, we are to keep our minds ſeparate from the world, principally for this end, that we may be the more
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:016767_0266_0F9E194D0623E258"/>
free for religious exerciſes.—Though it be a day of reſt, yet it was not deſigned to be a day of idleneſs: to reſt from worldly employments, without employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves about any thing, is but to lay ourſelves ſo much more in the devil's way. The mind will be employed ſome way or other; and therefore, doubtleſs, the end for which we are to call off our minds from worldly things on the ſabbath, in that we may employ them about things that are better.</p>
               <p>WE are to attend on ſpiritual exerciſes with the greateſt diligence. That it is a day of reſt, doth not hinder us in ſo doing; for we are to look on ſpiritual exerciſes but as the reſt and refreſhment of the ſoul. In heaven, where the people of GOD have the moſt perfect reſt, they are not idle, but are imployed in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and heavenly exerciſes.—We ſhould take care thereforeto employ our minds on a ſabbath day, on ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual objects, by holy meditation; improving for our help therein, the holy ſcriptures and other books that are according to the word of GOD.—We ſhould alſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ourſelves outwardly on this day, in the duties of divine worſhip, in public and private. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be more frequent and abundant in ſecret du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on this day, than on other days, as we have time and opportunity; as well as to attend on public or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.</p>
               <p>IT is proper on this day, not only eſpecially to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the exerciſe of religion in ourſelves; but alſo in others; to be aſſiſting them, and endeavoring to promote their ſpiritual good, by religious converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conference.—Eſpecially thoſe who have the care of others, ought on this day to endeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their ſpiritual good: heads of families ſhould be inſtructing and counſelling their children, and quickening them in the ways of religion, and ſhould
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:016767_0267_0F9E194E5402DD20"/>
ſee to it that the ſabbath be ſtrictly kept in their houſes. A peculiar bleſſing may be expected upon thoſe families, where there is due care taken, that the ſabbath be ſtrictly and devoutly obſerved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. WE are on this day eſpecially to meditate upon and celebrate the work of redemption. We are with ſpecial joy to remember the reſurrection of CHRIST; becauſe that was the finiſhing of the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this is the day whereon Chriſt reſted and was refreſhed, after he had endured thoſe extreme labours, which he endured for our periſhing ſouls. This was the day of the gladneſs of CHRIST'S heart; it was the day of his deliverance from the chains of death, and alſo of our deliverance: for we are delivered in him who is our head. He, as it were, roſe with his elect. He is the firſt fruits; thoſe that are CHRIST'S will follow. CHRIST, when he roſe, was juſtified as a public perſon, and we are juſtified in him. This is the day of our deliverance out of Egypt.</p>
               <p>WE ſhould therefore meditate on this with joy; we ſhould have a ſympathy with CHRIST in his joy. He was refreſhed on this day, we ſhould be refreſhed as thoſe whoſe hearts are united with his. When CHRIST rejoices, it becomes all his church every where to rejoice.—We are to ſay of this day, <q>This is the day that the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>BUT we are not only to commemorate the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of CHRIST, but the whole work of redemption, of which this was the finiſhing. We keep the day on which the work was finiſhed, becauſe it is in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the whole work.—We ſhould on this day contemplate the wonderful love of GOD and of CHRIST as expreſſed in the work of redemption; and our remembrance of theſe thing ſhould be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with ſuitable exerciſes of ſoul with reſpect to
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:016767_0268_0F9E194E62DD8980"/>
them. When we call to mind the love of CHRIST, it ſhould be with a return of love on our part. When we commemorate this work, it ſhould be with faith in the Saviour.—And we ſhould praiſe GOD and the Lamb for this work, for the divine glory and love manifeſted in it, in our private and public prayers, in talking of the wonderful works of GOD, and in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divine ſongs.</p>
               <p>HENCE it is proper that CHRIST'S diſciples ſhould chooſe this day to come together to break bread, or to celebrate the ordinance of the LORD'S ſupper; (Acts xx. 7.) becauſe it is an ordinance inſtituted in remembrance of the work of redemption.</p>
               <p n="5">5. WORKS of mercy and charity are very proper and acceptable to CHRIST, on this day. They were proper on the antient ſabbath. CHRIST was wont to do ſuch works on the ſabbath-day. But they eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally become the chriſtian ſabbath, becauſe it is a day kept in commemoration of the greateſt work of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and love towards us, that ever was wrought. What can be more proper, than that on ſuch a day we ſhould be expreſſing our love and mercy towards our fellow creatures, and eſpecially our fellow chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. CHRIST loves to ſee us ſhow our thankfulneſs to him in ſuch ways as theſe. Therefore we find, that the Holy Ghoſt was eſpecially careful, that ſuch works ſhould be performed on the firſt day of the week, in the primitive church, as we learn by our text.</p>
