            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEING embarked with you in the ſame common cauſe of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to ſave the lives of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's ſubjects, I have taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of prefixing your name to theſe Sermons; not with the view of its protecting them, for it ſeems it was not ſufficient to protect your own work, but from a deſire I had of
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:023758_0004_0FC0F013E791E5E8"/>
ſhowing my high eſteem of your head and heart. Although we dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in ſome points (which are chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeculative) yet I am happy in finding that we agree in thoſe things which are moſt eſſential, in one ſenſe of the words, to man's ſalvation. It is with pleaſure we now ſee the ſame freedom of enquiry extending itſelf to medicine, which has long prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in religion. While the common people reject infallibility in the head of a church, and a ſovereign efficacy in a few rites and ceremonies, they have unhappily remained enſlaved to the infallibility of medicine, or a few trifling preſcriptions, which are as unequal to the expectations of the vulgar in curing diſeaſes, as a wafer or extreme-unction are to expiate their ſins. Phyſic will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſuffer by undeceiving the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people; but, on the contrary, like the reformed Religion, it will become illuſtrious by ſtripping it of
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:023758_0005_0FC0F0154FB23428"/>
its pageantry.—Thus, the Indian receives not half the pleaſure from worſhipping the ſun, which the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher does from viewing it thro' a teleſcope.</p>
            <p>The clergy are not leſs honoured now than they were formerly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they do not pretend to work miracles, or to grant abſolution:— ſo phyſicians would not be leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected, ſhould they ſometimes diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim their uſurped omniſcience of the cauſes or events of diſeaſes, nor attempt always to cure them by receipts compoſed of ingredients drawn from every kingdom in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and every quarter of the globe.</p>
            <p>The clergy are often told, that example goes farther than precept. Upon this account, I think it would add much to the dignity of phyſic, if the profeſſors of it would live a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to their doctrines.</p>

            <p>THESE are the words of King Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, emphatically called the Wiſe Man, from his great pre-eminence in wiſdom over the whole human race. His knowledge, like his pleaſures, was unconfined, and while he tortured na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the one, he ranſacked her no leſs for the other. He was none of thoſe philoſophers, who exclaim againſt the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023758_0008_0FC0F01C17E83570"/>
world for no other reaſon, than becauſe they poſſeſs ſo ſmall a ſhare of it. He taſted, he poſſeſſed, he knew every thing which the mind of man in its moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ſtate is capable of taſting, poſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or knowing. This raiſes his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter above all praiſe, and gives the ſame eloquence to every thing which comes from his pen, as if a voice had proclaimed it from heaven.</p>
            <p>Without taking up your time in wire-drawing the words, which are plain, and ſtand in need of no illuſtration, I ſhall proceed immediately to ſpeak of TEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERANCE in EATING. The method I have choſen for this purpoſe, is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it as it relates</p>
            <p n="1">I. To the QUALITY.</p>
            <p n="2">II. To the QUANTITY of our ALI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT. And,</p>
            <p n="3">III. To the TIME of taking it. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this I ſhall conclude with an APPLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATION.</p>
            <p n="1">I. OF THE QUALITY OF OUR ALI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT. There hath been much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023758_0009_0FC0F01D8F4A0060"/>
declamation upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. There is ſuch a variety in the appetites and conſtitutions of mankind (implanted originally for wiſe purpoſes) that no fixed rules can be laid down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this head. In general, the more ſimple our food is, the better. Animal and vegetable food ſhould always be mixed together by people in health.— That nature intended man ſhould be ſupported by them both, we infer from the ſtructure of his teeth, and organs of digeſtion, which are formed upon the compound principles of carnivorous and granivorous animals. The proportion of vegetable food ſhould always predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, eſpecially in warm ſeaſons, and warm climates. Wild animals, and thoſe which are full grown, ſhould be prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to tame and young animals, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more eaſy of digeſtion and perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the ſame reaſon, fleſh which has been kept for ſome time, is to be preferred to that which is newly killed.</p>
            <p>Much has been ſaid againſt high-ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned food. To perſons, in the full vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor of health and youth, I grant it may be hurtful; but to old, and to ſickly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023758_0010_0FC0F02728FB0EF0"/>
who are afflicted with a general tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por of the alimentary canal, it is not only inoffenſive, but abſolutely neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. I appeal to all ſuch of my hearers, as labour under a weakneſs of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, indigeſtion, acid belchings, and the like, whether a little ſalted or ſmoak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beef has not ſat eaſier upon your ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, and been ſooner digeſted, than the moſt ſimple food that could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived. High-ſeaſoned food is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe neceſſary to the inhabitants of low marſhy countries, more eſpecially at thoſe ſeaſons of the year, when the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of ſuch places are epidemic. It is remarked in ſome of the Weſt-Indian iſlands, as well as in thoſe parts of South-America, which are within the tropic, that ſuch as eat a large quantity of ſpices of all kinds, with their food, are leſs ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the intermitting and bilious fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, than thoſe who avoid them. This is eaſily accounted for, when we reflect, how much they obviate the relaxing powers of heat and moiſture, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways combine to produce theſe diſeaſes. It is for this reaſon, probably, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has ſo ordered it, that the ſpicy trees grow ſpontaneouſly in warm cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates only, in all parts of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:023758_0011_0FC0F02853415A10"/>Before I conclude this head, I ſhall remark, that little miſchief is done to the conſtitution by the quality of ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Nature, for the moſt part, takes the alarm, and, unleſs we uſe violence with her, deprives us of our reliſh for thoſe things, which are deſtructive to our conſtitutions. Such perſons as love meat with thoſe qualities which are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, too often love likewiſe an exceſs in quantity, which leads us to the next head we propoſed, namely, to ſpeak</p>
            <p n="2">II. OF THE QUANTITY OF OUR A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIMENT. 'Temperance (ſays Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Temple) conſiſts in a regular and ſimple diet, limited by every man's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of his own eaſy digeſtion."— Food, therefore, may be ſaid to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in too large a quantity, when we do not feel light and cheerful after it.— There are few who do not eat one third, or a fourth, more than is neceſſary to ſupport them. The chief incentive to this is the variety of our diſhes, which excites us to eat after the appetite is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied. Few men, I believe, ever eat to exceſs more than <hi>once</hi> of one plain diſh.</p>

            <p>Next to our eating of but one diſh, I would inculcate eating but one <hi>hearty</hi> meal a day. In ſupport of this piece of advice, I might here ſummons many of the illuſtrious dead among the ancient philoſophers and legiſlators, who never eat more than one hearty meal in the four-and-twenty hours. So common was this ſimplicity of living in Greece, that Plato, upon being aſked, when he returned to Athens from his travels into Sicily, what he had ſeen that was curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous while he was abroad, anſwered, <hi>Vidi monſtrum in natura, hominem bis ſatura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum in die</hi>—"I have beheld (ſaid he) a monſter in nature; a man who eat two hearty meals in a day." Theſe are more than ſufficient to repair the daily waſte of the body. They oppreſs nature, and keep her conſtantly fatigued, in concoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the immenſe ſupplies of food which
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023758_0014_0FC0F03387E360F0"/>
are thrown into the ſtomach. Although ſhe ſometimes forbears long, yet, ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or later, ſhe takes ample vengeance of ſuch as treat her in this manner, by afflicting them with blotches, and other diſorders, which are the legitimate off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of this ſpecies of intemperance. But if we are to eat only one hearty meal a day, a queſtion very naturally occurs here, and that is, at what time ſhould it be taken?</p>
            <p>This brings us to our laſt general head, namely, to ſpeak of temperance as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the</p>
            <p n="3">III. TIME OF EATING. At preſent noon is looked upon as the moſt proper for this purpoſe. Hence we generally find dinner the principal meal through this country. I am aware of the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of oppoſing popular prejudices, and that it is often much better to ſwim with the multitude down the ſtream than to ſtem it alone. I am aware too of the fate of reformers in religion, politics, and ſcience. Many have loſt their characters, their livings, and even their lives, by advancing things contrary to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:023758_0015_0FC0F039E01C6DB0"/>
the eſtabliſhed opinions of the world. But, ſhould this be my caſe, I will not conceal my ſentiments, nor reſiſt what I look upon and feel to be the ſacred power of truth. It is well known to every one, that exerciſe of mind or body is diſagreeable after dinner. Nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coils from them both. Every full meal is a ſtimulous to the whole ſyſtem, and brings on a temporary fever, which ſhows itſelf in that chillineſs and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of pulſe, which are ſo remarkable after eating. To add to theſe either ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of body or mind, is to divide and weaken the powers of nature in a work which requires the combined action of them all. Upon this account, I think the principal meal ſhould always be made in the evening.</p>
            <p>The old Romans, we find, in the early and virtuous ages of their common-wealth, made their chief meal after night. The French (except ſuch of them as co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py after the Engliſh manners) and the Italians always make ſupper their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal meal. The Indians in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try (who live the moſt agreeable to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any people in the world) eat fleſh
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023758_0016_0FC0F03B5245EAE0"/>
but once in the four-and-twenty hours, and that is in the evening, after the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues of fiſhing, hunting, or marching, are over. The Spaniards, who have not yet adopted the French and Italian cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of making their chief meal at night, are nevertheleſs ſo unanimous in the practice of ſleeping an hour or two every day after dinner, that it is a common thing to hear a Spaniard ſay, in moſt of the cities of Spain, that 'none but Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhmen and dogs are to be ſeen in their ſtreets immediately after dinner.' Sleep is always natural after eating. Nature calls loudly for it. It is common to all the brute animals we are acquainted with. That ſtate of the body or mind which approaches neareſt to it, is always moſt agreeable to us, when we cannot enjoy it immediately.—Hence we read that many ancient nations uſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline upon beds or cuſhions, and to lean upon each other at their entertainments. This poſture in eating was practiſed by the Greeks, Romans,<note n="*" place="bottom">The bed uſed for this purpoſe by the Romans was called from the Greeks TRICLINIUM, from its containing only three people. Juvenal, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this poſture in eating, ſays,
<q>"<hi>Gremio</hi> jacet nova nupra mariti."</q>
Hence ſo ſome derive the origin of the expreſſion, "Boſom friends."</note> and Perſians,<note n="†" place="bottom">Eſther and Haman lay upon the ſame bed at the royal banquet given by the queen to king A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haſuenus. Eſther vii. 8.</note>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:023758_0017_0FC0F03F594F2810"/>
nor was it uncommon among the Jews.<note n="‡" place="bottom">We infer that this practice was common a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Jews from the cuſtom of pulling off their ſhoes before they began to eat; the deſign of this being to preſerve their beds clean. Our Saviour, we find, conformed to it. Unleſs we ſuppoſe this, we cannot explain in what manner Mary Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len <hi>ſtood behind</hi> him while he was eating in the houſe of Simon, and "waſhed his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head.' Luke vii. 38. At the laſt feaſt he had with his diſciples (which was a ſupper) he admitted him who ſat next to him to lean upon his boſom. John xiii. 25.</note> But what proves, above all things, that reſt and ſleep are neceſſary after eating, is, that digeſtion has been lately proved to be carried on chiefly by FERMENTA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION, to which reſt, every body knows, is ſo eſſentially neceſſary, that it cannot take place without it. Unleſs the body
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023758_0018_0FC0F040D17B3C28"/>
enjoys more or leſs of this after eating, there can be no <hi>perfect</hi> concoction of the food. This is what all muſt conſent to, who have been obliged to ride on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, or to uſe any violent exerciſe of body, after a hearty dinner. The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, in ſuch caſes, is ſo diſturbed, that perſons have complained of being indiſpoſed for ſeveral days after it.</p>
            <p>But methinks I hear ſome object and ſay, that eating a hearty ſupper makes them reſtleſs in the night, and prevents their ſleeping. To ſuch I would wiſh joy.—It is a proof that nature has not yet ſunk under the weight of two hearty meals a day; for I never heard any one make this complaint who did not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe eat a hearty dinner. Leave off di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in your uſual manner, and, inſtead of eating half a pound, or a pound of fleſh, with vegetables proportioned to it, allay your appetite with a little bread and cheeſe, a bowl of light ſoup, a cup of coffee or chocolate, or, after the French cuſtom, with a few raiſins, or an apple, and I am perſuaded you will feel no inconvenience from eating a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſupper. Here give me leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023758_0019_0FC0F0424F7824E0"/>
to you, that the more of theſe light ſubſtances you take during the day, the better, as they tend to leſſon the ſenſe of hunger, or the keenneſs of the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, which too often provokes us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance Sir Francis Bacon tells us a ſtory of a very old man, whoſe manner of living he enquired into, and found that he obſerved no other rules than eating <hi>before</hi> he was hungry, and drinking <hi>before</hi> he was dry; for by theſe means, he ſaid, he was ſure never to eat nor to drink too much at a time.—If we appeal once more to the brute ani<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mals, they will furniſh us with arguments in favour of this practice. Every ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy borrowed from them deſerves to be attended to, as they have never yet ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected their inſtincts to the tyranny of faſhion. The cow and the horſe, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the ſheep, when they range at large in a paſture, feed with little interruption during the day, and thus guard againſt the intemperate effects of hunger. The horſe, it is true, ſometimes ſuffers from this cauſe; but it is only when he is obliged to live as we do, that is, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide his meals into three or four in a day, and to work immediately after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023758_0020_0FC0F048E66062F8"/>
It is univerſally agreed, that people live much longer in warm than in cold climates. May not one reaſon of this be owing to the heat of ſuch cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates diminiſhing their appetites, and thus preventing their wearing out their conſtitutions by exceſs of eating?—I would have it remembered here, that in ſpeaking of warm climates, I mean the improved parts of Aſia and Africa only. The warm climates of America are as yet too little cultivated, to allow us to extend the obſervation to our own country.—But to return. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I hear others ſay, if we make ſupper our principal meal, we ſhall o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſet part of an old rule, which bids us,
<q>
                  <l>After dinner ſit a while,</l>
                  <l>After ſupper walk a mile.</l>
               </q>
This adage, it is true, from its great antiquity, as well as from its being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered in rhyme, comes armed with the ſtrength of Sampſon, but it does not require the ſkill of a Delilah to cut its locks. I might here mention an hundred common ſayings in ſeveral of the arts and ſciences, as well as in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023758_0021_0FC0F049D0673FD0"/>
life, which are equally univerſal, and at the ſame time equally falſe with the above. It is a vulgar error, and is repugnant both to experience and ſound philoſophy. I conclude, therefore, that it is moſt agreeable to the uſage of the moſt civilized nations—to the practice of ſavages—to nature—and to common experience, to eat our chief meal at night, and that the ſeeming objections againſt it are of no weight.</p>
            <p>I haſten now to the APPLICATION of this diſcourſe. And here I might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim againſt the depravity of man, which has converted the common bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of life into weapons of deſtruction againſt himſelf —I might open Pando<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's box, or ſhow you Milton's lazar-houſe,

And might prove to you, that moſt of theſe diſeaſes are the children of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in eating. I might conduct you to yonder grave-yard, and point to the tombs of many of your former com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who "came up like flowers, and were cut down," and who, ſtrictly ſpeaking, "lived not out half their days."—But, without entering upon theſe things, I ſhall conclude, by fixing your attention on the picture of a man who has ſpent part of his life "among riotous eaters of fleſh."—Mark his pale countenance! his belly is ſwelled—His phyſicians tell us that it ariſes from a fixed obſtruction in his liver, which has brought on a ſpecies of dropſy of the worſt ſort.—See! with what difficulty he breathes! A flow fever conſumes his vitals—His thirſt is inextinguiſhable.— Say, ye patrons and practiſers of the healing art, can nothing be done to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him from this deplorable conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Call for ſome rich dainty—Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps this may revive him—Tell him of
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023758_0023_0FC0F04CD2132E98"/>
his paſt enjoyment—of the honour he once had of eating and drinking with the "Rulers" and chief men of the land. Alas! theſe can avail nothing. —The ſight of the one—and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the other—ſerve only to increaſe his pain.—Will cordials and bitters do nothing to rouſe the languid powers of life? Their virtues have long ago been exhauſted, when there was no occaſion for them. Better, far better, would it have been for him, had he (in the words of our text) "put a knife to his throat," or even plunged a dagger into his heart, the firſt day he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to his appetite, than lived to endure ſuch aggravated miſery. In a word, all nature is up in arms againſt him—The elements keep back their medical aids—They take part in their Creator's quarrel, whoſe bounties he has abuſed—The air refuſes to expand his lungs—water, to allay his thirſt— fire, to warm his limbs, and thus he dies his own executioner. Be exhorted, my hearers, from theſe conſiderations, to temperance and ſobriety. If you have any love for yourſelves—for your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies—for your poſterity—and for the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023758_0024_0FC0F0568706ACF0"/>
community to which you belong, think of theſe things. I have only to add my beſt wiſhes, that what has been deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this ſubject may have due weight with you, more eſpecially at this ſeaſon of the year<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe Sermons were written about Chriſtmas.</note>, when, as the Poet expreſſes it,

            <p>THE laſt time I addreſſed you from this place, I enlarged upon Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance in Eating; in the preſent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſhall lay before you a few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations upon the USE and ABUSE of WINE and STRONG DRINK. This, I ſhall attempt, by conſidering more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023758_0026_0FC0F058D048DE78"/>
the words of our text. For this purpoſe, I ſhall enquire,</p>
            <p n="1">I. TO WHOM WINE AND STRONG DRINK SHOULD BE GIVEN.</p>
            <p n="2">II. TO WHOM THEY SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN; and then I ſhall conclude with an APPLICATION.</p>
            <p n="1">I. WINE OR STRONG DRINK MAY BE GIVEN.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the ſick. The diſeaſes in which wine is indicated are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>ſlow nervous fever.</hi> Here the powers of nature are weakened and oppreſſed, and the poor patient may, ſtrictly ſpeaking, be ſaid to be ready to periſh. Wine may be adminiſtered therefore in ſuch caſes with advantage.—If ever it fails of doing ſervice, it is becauſe it is given in too ſmall a quantity. <hi>Secondly,</hi> In chronic diſeaſes, which are accompanied with a langour of the whole ſyſtem, which ſhows itſelf in a more eſpecial manner in the <hi>ſtomach,</hi> wine is a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign remedy. It was to relieve a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of this kind that St. Paul preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed it to his ſon Timothy. By its gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023758_0027_0FC0F05A4FA2B750"/>
ſtimulus it excites the action of the ſtomach—invigorates the circulation— opens obſtructions—and thus, in ſome meaſure, renews the whole conſtitution. The relief which wine affords in theſe caſes, is the more certain, if the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſyſtem has been brought on by grief, or any of thoſe paſſions which are of the ſedative kind. Here the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy heart is revived, and made to ſing for joy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Wine is ſometimes neceſſary to the inhabitants of low marſhy countries. The moiſture of ſuch places obſtructs perſpiration, and brings on a general laxity of the ſyſtem. When uſed in a moderate quantity, it braces the ſolids, and by keeping up a proper balance between them and the fluids, it obviates diſeaſes.—Hence we ſeldom find thoſe people, who live in affluence, and who can afford to drink a glaſs or two of generous wine every day, afflicted with thoſe fevers and agues, which make ſuch great havock among poor people. The Hollanders have been charged with the national reflection of loving ſtrong drink. This cenſure is unjuſt, as neceſſity at
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:023758_0028_0FC0F063F0AFB308"/>
firſt drove them to it; and as it is by uſing wine and other ſpirituous liquors in moderation, that they guard them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the ill effects of the moiſture to which their country is always expoſed. Remember, you are to uſe wine in theſe caſes only during that ſeaſon, in which theſe diſeaſes are epidemic; which, in this climate, is chiefly during the months of Auguſt, September, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wine is principally uſeful to old people, or ſuch as are in the decline of life. It is hard to fix the limits between the beginning of old age, and the cloſe of manhood. At a medium, the body begins to decline at the age of forty-five or fifty in this climate. Then the hot fit of the fever of life begins to abate, and from the many diſappointments in love—friendſhip—ambition, or trade, which moſt of men meet with by the time they arrive at this age, they gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally feel a heavy heart.—The decay of the vital heat—the ſlowneſs of the pulſe —the diminution of the ſtrength, all ſhow that the vigour of the ſyſtem is declining. Here wine prolongs the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023758_0029_0FC0F064F73725A8"/>
ſtrength and powers of nature; it is the grave of paſt misfortunes: in a word, it is another name for phyloſophy. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, my aged hearers, if you would expect to enjoy a long reprieve from the infirmities of age, you muſt begin to uſe wine moderately, and increaſe the quantity of it as you deſcend into the valley of life.—Add to this, you muſt diminiſh the quantity of your ſolid aliment.—This nature points out to us; by depriving us of our teeth in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as we grow old, teaching us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that we have now no longer uſe for them.</p>
            <p>I come now to the ſecond general head of my diſcourſe, namely,</p>
            <p n="2">II. TO SHOW TO WHOM WINE OR STRONG DRINK SHOULD NOT BE GIV<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EN.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>Firſt</hi> place, it ſhould not be given to children. Wine, we ſaid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, is of a heating nature, and is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated in thoſe conſtitutions and ages, where a ſtimulus is neceſſary to ſupport the powers of life. Children, from the natural vigour of their ſyſtems, which ſhows itſelf in the remarkable quickneſs
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023758_0030_0FC0F06655445218"/>
of their pulſes, and in their great acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of mind and body, ſtand in no need of a ſtimulus of this kind. On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, every thing ſhould be withheld from them, which tends to add to the natural impetuoſity of their fluids, or the vigorous action of their ſolids.— Hence we are led to commend thoſe parents, who forbid their children to taſte all kinds of animal food (upon the account of its ſtimulating quality) till they are upwards of ſeven or eight years of age. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Studious people, or thoſe who have occaſion to exerciſe their thinking faculties much, ſhould abſtain from wine. Thinking is a ſtimulus to the conſtitution, and wears out the ſprings of life beyond the moſt laborious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of body.—Much ſtudy is literally a "wearineſs of the fleſh."—Hence we find ſtateſmen, generals, and even ſuch as fill the learned profeſſions with dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, are more ſubject to the gout, from ſmall deviations in their ordinary way of living, than other people. Wine, and a conſtant or vigorous exertion of the active faculties of the ſoul, produce
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023758_0031_0FC0F067D16AD8D8"/>
nearly the ſame effects upon the body. —This is one reaſon probably why So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon, in the chapter from whence our text is taken, ſays, "It is not for kings to drink wine, nor for princes ſtrong drink." Much recreation and great exerciſe of body, are neceſſary to guard againſt the effects of too much applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind to buſineſs; ſhould the ſtimulating effects of wine be added to this, relief will be ſought from exerciſe and amuſements in vain. But,</p>
            <p n="3">3. Wine ſhould not be uſed by young people, or ſuch as are under five and thirty or forty years of age, unleſs they labour under ſome of thoſe evils we mentioned under our firſt head. The purſuits and pleaſures of youth are too often more than ſufficient to keep the ſyſtem in an excited ſtate. To add wine to theſe, is like throwing oil into fire, in order to extinguiſh it. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a ſign of a vitiated heart, when in full health wine is called for, in order to impart cheerfulneſs to it<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>
                     <l>O ſeldom may the fatal hour return,</l>

<pb n="32" facs="unknown:023758_0032_0FC0F06F924E3BC8"/>
wine in the early part of life; you will receive benefit from it when you grow old. You will likewiſe eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape that dreadful ſcourge of intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the gout. This is the natural off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of wine. In the great empire of China the gout is unknown. This is owing to their being unacquainted with the juice of the grape; and is a proof that the other cauſes, which have been accuſed of bringing on the gout, act too feebly to produce it, unleſs they are rouſed into action by the uſe of wine. Beſides all this, by refraining from wine during this period of your lives, you may become the fathers of a healthful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny, whoſe ruddy looks, and well-form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed limbs, will adorn your happy board, and more than repay you for your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence and ſelf-denial.</p>

who have made it a conſtant practiſe to get drunk almoſt every day for thirty or forty years, who, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, arrived to a great age, and enjoyed the ſame good health as thoſe who have followed the ſtricteſt rules of temperance—or who have lived by weight and meaſure like Lewis Corna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro himſelf?—Some inſtances of this kind I grant might be mentioned; but they are few when compared with the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who have abſtained from wine and ſtrong drink: even theſe have began to drink after their conſtitutions were on the decline. They were more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over generally poor people, who were obliged to work hard for their ſupport, and thus by their labour carried off the effects of their intemperance. But who knows how much longer they might have lived, had they been more tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. Perhaps after all, they died mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs to ſpirituous liquors, and at the age of eighty, ninety, or even an hundred, were guilty of a ſpecies of ſuicide. If you ſhould ſee a ſailor fall from the maſt of a ſhip under full ſail into the ſea, and afterwards be taken up alive, would you not think his companions mad, if
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023758_0034_0FC0F0778B395A20"/>
they ſhould leap from the ſame place, in hopes of meeting with the ſame good fortune?—</p>
            <p>But who is he that ſays, if we baniſh wine from company, how ſhall we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to entertain our friends? The poets and philoſophers of former ages, who abound ſo much with the praiſes of wine, would riſe up againſt us, ſhould we tear ſo precious a relick from the temple of hoſpitality. To this I anſwer, that more have complained of drinking too much, than of drinking too little in company. How many have refuſed to be preſent at entertainments, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were afraid of being forced to drink to exceſs? How many are obliged to counterfeit excuſes, or to ſteal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately from company for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? What confuſion—what diſcord, among the moſt intimate friends, have you not ſeen follow thoſe feaſts where the hoſt has relied upon the quantity or goodneſs of his wine, for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of his gueſts?—Three or four glaſſes of wine will impart all its cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful qualities to a ſtomach which is not rendered inſenſible to it by habit or
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023758_0035_0FC0F079392F9E30"/>
diſeaſe. Theſe may be taken occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally among friends by perſons of all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and conditions, eſpecially upon feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſeaſons. Theſe ſeaſons, however, ſhould not recur too often. Our SAVI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUR wrought a miracle at a wedding, in order to furniſh wine to the gueſts; but he fed five thouſand people with a few loves and fiſhes in the wilderneſs, without ordering any wine to be drank after them. This is the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as there is no food which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to require wine with it ſo much as fiſh,—it being a common ſaying, that it ſhould always ſwim three times— namely, in water—butter—and wine.</p>
            <p>It is time now to haſten to the AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLICATION of this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Here then I would call upon the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed and the melancholy part of my hearers, as well as ſuch whoſe misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune it is to live in low marſhy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, to come and partake of this ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign antidote to diſeaſe and care.— Baniſh your cordials—your bitters, and your magneſias, the paltry preſcriptions of mercenary quacks, and ſubſtitute in the room of them a few glaſſes of good
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:023758_0036_0FC0F08013F3FC88"/>
old wine. But to you, my aged hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers—my venerable fathers, would I chiefly addreſs myſelf. Come here and drown all your ſorrows in full bumpers of Liſbon or Madeira.—Here forget the inconſtancy of your miſtreſſes—the perfidy of friends—the broken promiſes of your patrons—and the villainy of thoſe who have betrayed either your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt or character.—Above all things, here you may forget not only to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, but even to feel moſt of thoſe infirmities which are too often connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with your age. "The keepers of the houſe, ſhall ceaſe to tremble—nor ſhall the ſtrong men bow themſelves; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though your grinders may ceaſe, becauſe they are few, yet thoſe that look out of the windows, ſhall not be darkened.— Ye ſhall not riſe at the voice of the bird, unable to ſleep any longer, nor ſhall the graſs-hopper any more be a burthen to you." The days ſhall never come in which you ſhall ſay, "we have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in them." Thus will you prolong your health and ſpirits till, like full ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured fruit, you ſhall drop into the lap of your mother earth. Your bodies, like the garments of the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023758_0037_0FC0F0814F06FC20"/>
ſhall not be torn by the ravages of time—and the ſame ſtroke which puts an end to your enjoyments, ſhall cut the ſilver cord of life.</p>
            <p>It is now time to addreſs myſelf to another claſs of my hearers. Firſt, let me call upon parents to withhold wine from their children. It is a poiſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a cordial, which you pour down their little throats. No fortune which you can bequeath them, will ever be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivalent for depriving them of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable bleſſing of a good conſtitution. Next, let me call upon ſtateſmen, legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, and all thoſe who labour for the public good, to abſtain from wine. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, you are the guardians of your country: public buſineſs ſhould, like time, have no pauſes. How often have treaties been ſuſpended, and even march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and battles been delayed, by the principals or leaders of them being laid up with a fit of the gout. Suffer not the ſhort-lived pleaſures of drinking, to rob you of your fame or importance, or to obſtruct your motions through theſe exalted ſpheres which you are called to fill. But to you, young men, would I
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:023758_0038_0FC0F087D50C2B18"/>
now, in the laſt place, addreſs myſelf.— You have heard ſeveral arguments a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the neceſſity of your drinking wine. None of you can pretend to be of heavy hearts, or ready to periſh. If you are not moved by a regard to your own health and happineſs—think of your poſterity. Let not your third and forth generations be viſited for your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: they will imprecate vengeance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your aſhes every time they feel the puniſhment of your folly.</p>
            <p>But if, after all I have ſaid, you are determined to perſevere in your uſual manner of living, I muſt addreſs you once more in the words of the Wiſe Man, and ſay, "Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth, and let thy heart cheer thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thy heart, and in the ſight of thine eyes;" yet remember there is a time coming when you will repent that you have hated reproof, and turned a deaf ear to the voice of the preacher. There is the ſame inſeparable connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between intemperance and diſeaſe, that there is betwixt vice and its puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Unleſs you ſhould be cut off by
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:023758_0039_0FC0F08908E45630"/>
ſome ſudden guſt of intemperance, you may depend upon feeling the effects of it hereafter. Think now, I beſeech you, of the ſleepleſs nights—of the low ſpirits—of the ſcorching pains in your hands and feet which await you. To give you an idea of the dreadful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of exceſs in drinking, let me beg of you to accompany me to the bed-chamber of a mar afflicted with the gout. Be not alarmed at his groans— Let us go in—Is this the man who a few years ago was the life and ſoul of every company he went into?—Is this he who boaſted of the quantity of liquor he could drink without being intoxica<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted?—who ſpent his youth in a conſtant round of gaiety and pleaſure?—How is he changed!—It is now eleven years ſince he has been a priſoner in this cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. His phyſicians have long ſince deſerted him! nor is it any reproach to their art that they cannot cure him, any more than it is that they are unable to raiſe the dead. He is a burthen to his friends. In vain does he ſeek relief from wine—food—phyſic—company, or even from philoſophy. His only a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement is to number the days of his
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:023758_0040_0FC0F09054B6E6F8"/>
miſery on the wall, with the chalk which grows on the ends of his fingers.— Death, the laſt friend of the wretched, refuſes to come at his call—He lives—I retract the word—He has ceaſed to live ever ſince his confinement:—He breathes ſhorter and ſhorter, till at laſt he cloſes his eyes for ever in the ſilence of death. This is no exaggerated picture. We have all ſeen it at ſome time of our lives.</p>
            <p>I cannot conclude what has been ſaid upon this ſubject, with words more to our purpoſe than thoſe of Solomon: "Who hath woe? who hath ſorrow? who hath contentions? who hath bab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling? who hath wounds without cauſe? who hath redneſs of eyes? They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to ſeek mixt wine. Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his colour in the cup, when it moveth itſelf aright. At the laſt it bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth like a ſerpent, and ſtingeth like an adder."</p>

            <p>MAN was formed to be active. The vigour of his mind, and the health of his body can be fully preſerved by no other means, than by labour of ſome ſort. Hence, when we read the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence which was pronounced upon man after the fall, "That in the ſweat of his
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:023758_0042_0FC0F09848671F80"/>
brow he ſhould eat bread all the days of his life;" we cannot help admiring the goodneſs of the Supreme Being, in connecting his puniſhment with what had now become the neceſſary means of preſerving his health. Had God aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned him to idleneſs, he would have entailed tenfold miſery upon him. The ſolid parts of his body, particularly the nerves, would have loſt their tone—the muſcles would have loſt their feeling and moving powers—and the fluids, in conſequence of this, would have loſt their original or native qualities, and have ſtagnated in every part of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But, inſtead of inflicting this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated puniſhment upon him, he bids him be ACTIVE, and implants a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple within him which impels him to it. Civil ſociety and agriculture began to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The latter has always been looked upon among the firſt employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mankind.—It calls forth every individual of the human race into acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;—it employs the body in a manner the moſt conducive to its health; it preſerves and increaſes the ſpecies moſt; —and laſtly, it is moſt friendly to the practice of virtue. For theſe reaſons,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:023758_0043_0FC0F09958663F10"/>
therefore, it is natural to conclude, that it is moſt agreeable to the Supreme Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that man ſhould be ſupported by it. The earth is a ſkilful as well as a kind mother to her children. Inſtead of pouring her treaſures in lapfuls upon them at once, and conſigning them to idleneſs ever afterwards, ſhe beſtows her gifts with a ſparing hand, and ceaſes to yield them any thing, as ſoon as they ceaſe to cultivate her. Thus by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing conſtant labour, ſhe meant to entail conſtant health upon them.</p>
            <p>But theſe employments were too in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent for the reſtleſs ſpirit of man. He ſoon deſerted his fields—and his flocks—and ſought for ſome more ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy methods of acquiring fortune—inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence—and a ſuperiority over his fellow-creatures. Theſe have been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by commerce—war—rapine— and laſtly, to the reproach of the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican colonies, and of humanity, be it ſpoken, by the perpetration of a crime, compared with which, every other breach of the laws of nature or nations, deſerves the name of holineſs, I mean, by SLAVERY. But in exchange for
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023758_0044_0FC0F09DA3D6E570"/>
theſe, he hath given up that greateſt of all bleſſings, HEALTH. He hath had recourſe to medicine as a ſuccedaneum for labour; but this hath proved inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; for the foſſil—vegetable—and thoſe parts of the animal kingdom which are employed in medicine, have not yet learned, like man, to riſe in rebellion againſt the will of their Creator. So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon ſeems to have been aware of this in the words of our text; and hence we hear him calling upon him to awake from his unhealthy "ſlumber"—to riſe from his enervating bed—to unfold his "arms," and employ them in ſome uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful labour, leaſt ſickneſs, with its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion "poverty," ſhould come upon him like "travail upon a woman with child; or like an "armed man:" nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which can be avoided or reſiſted. But Solomon, and all the preachers from his time to the preſent day, who have addreſſed him upon this ſubject, have uſed their eloquence in vain. Since therefore we cannot bring man back again to his implements of huſbandry, we muſt attempt to find out ſome kinds of exerciſe as ſubſtitutes for them. The moſt healthy and long-lived people are
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:023758_0045_0FC0F09E9994CC30"/>
found among the labouring part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind —Would the rich then enjoy health and long-life, they muſt do that of choice which theſe people do of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. They muſt by exerciſe, ſubject themſelves to a kind of voluntary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>
            <p>As this diſcourſe is addreſſed chiefly to the rich and the luxurious, who are the moſt given to idleneſs, I ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine myſelf to exerciſe only; and, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to handle the ſubject in the moſt extenſive manner, I ſhall conſider</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE DIFFERENT MODES OF EX<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERCISE.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE PROPER TIME FOR USING IT; and then I ſhall conclude with an APPLICATION.</p>
            <p n="1">I. All Exerciſe may be divided into ACTIVE and PASSIVE.</p>
            <p>ACTIVE EXERCISE includes walking —running—dancing—fencing—ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, and the like.</p>
            <p>PASSIVE EXERCISE includes ſailing —riding in a carriage, and on horſeback.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:023758_0046_0FC0F0A531A198D0"/>
The laſt of theſe it of a mixed nature, and is in ſome meaſure active as well as paſſive. We ſhall treat of each of them in order.</p>
            <p>OF ACTIVE EXERCISE.</p>
            <p>WALKING is the moſt gentle ſpecies of it we are acquainted with. It pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motes perſpiration, and if not continued too long, invigorates and ſtrengthens the ſyſtem. As the moſt ſimple and wholeſome drink, namely water, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in every body's reach, ſo this ſpecies of ſimple and wholeſome exerciſe is in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body's power, who has the uſe of his limbs. It is to be lamented, that carriages are too often ſubſtituted in the room of it. At Pekin in China, we are told, that none but the emperor, and a few of the firſt officers of ſtate, are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to uſe chariots. Although the intention of this law was to ſuppreſs the number of horſes, in order to make room for the increaſe and ſupport of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies, in the number of which the riches of all countries conſiſt, yet we find it attended with good effects otherwiſe; for the rich and the great, by being obliged to walk in common
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023758_0047_0FC0F0A6117FD3F0"/>
with the poor people, enjoy with them the common bleſſing of health, more than people of the ſame rank in other countries. To ſuch as can be<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> it, I would recommend walking frequently up a hill. The inhabitants of moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous countries are generally healthy and long-lived. This is commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the purity of the air in ſuch places. Although this has a <hi>chief</hi> ſhare in it, yet I cannot help thinking, that the frequent and neceſſary exerciſe of climb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mountains, which theſe people are obliged to undergo, adds much to their health and lives. Every body knows how much walking up a hill tends to create an appetite. This depends upon its increaſing the inſenſible perſpiration: —an excretion with which the appetite, and the ſtate of the ſtomach in general, are much connected.</p>
            <p>RUNNING is too violent to be uſed often, or continued for any length of time. The running-footmen in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries are ſhort-lived:—Few of them eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape conſumptions before they arrive at their thirty-fifth year.—Sweating and perſpiration, according to Sanctorius,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:023758_0048_0FC0F0A79B75ADA8"/>
have been found to be incompatible:— The former always ſuppreſſes the latter. Upon this account, I would recommend it to be uſed as ſeldom as poſſible.</p>
            <p>DANCING is a moſt ſalutary exerciſe. Future ages will be ſurpriſed to hear, that rational creatures ſhould, at any time, have looked upon it as a criminal amuſement. To reaſon againſt it, from its abuſe, concludes equally ſtrong a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the lawfulneſs of every thing we hold ſacred and valuable in life.—It was a part of the Jewiſh worſhip. By its mechanical effects on the body, it inſpires the mind with cheerfulneſs; and this, when well founded, and properly reſtrained, is another name for religion. It is common among the Indians, and the ſavage nations of all countries, upon public and feſtive occaſions.—They have their war—their love—and their religious dances. The muſic, which always accompanies this exerciſe, hath a pleaſing and ſalutary effect upon the body as well as the mind It is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed through the avenue of the ears to the brain, the common centre of life and motion, from whence its oſcillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:023758_0049_0FC0F0A94A0F2E18"/>
are communicated to every part of the ſyſtem, imparting to each that equal and uniform vigour and action, upon which the healthy ſtate of all the functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons depends. It would lead us to a long digreſſion, or I might here menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many remarkable cures which have been performed, particularly of thoſe diſorders, which are much connected with the nervous ſyſtem, by the magic power of muſic. Dancing ſhould not be uſed more than once or twice a week. It ſhould never be continued till wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs comes on, nor ſhould we expoſe ourſelves to the cold air too ſoon after it.</p>
            <p>FENCING calls forth moſt of the muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles into exerciſe, particularly thoſe which move the limbs. The brain is likewiſe rouſed by it, through the avenue of the eyes; and its action, as in the caſe of muſic, is propagated to the whole ſyſtem. It has long been a ſubject of complaint, that the human ſpecies has been degenerating for theſe ſeveral cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies. When we ſee the coats of mail of our anceſtors, who fought under Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and Heneries of former ages, we wonder how they moved, much more
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023758_0050_0FC0F0B6312EBE78"/>
how they atchieved ſuch great exploits, beneath the weight of ſuch maſſy cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. We grant that rum—tobacco —tea—and ſome other luxuries of modern invention, have had a large ſhare in weakning the ſtamina of our conſtitutions, and thus producing a more feeble race of men; yet we muſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute much of our great inferiority in ſtrength, ſize and agility to our fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to the diſuſe which the invention of gun-powder and fire-arms hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced of thoſe athletic exerciſes, which were ſo much practiſed in former ages, as a part of military diſcipline.</p>
            <p>Too much cannot be ſaid in praiſe of SWIMMING, or as the poet of Avon expreſſes it—"buffeting the waves with luſty ſinews." Beſides exerciſing the limbs, it ſerves to waſh away the duſt, which is apt to mix itſelf with the ſweat of our bodies in warm weather. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frequently in water, we find, was enjoined upon the Jews and Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans, as a part of their religious ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. The Hollanders are cleanly in their houſes and ſtreets, without remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering, or perhaps knowing, that clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023758_0051_0FC0F0B757224590"/>
was abſolutely neceſſary at firſt, to guard againſt the effects of thoſe inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of mire, to which their country is always expoſed:—ſo a Jew and a Muſſulman contend for, and practiſe their ablutions, without remembering that they were inſtituted only to guard them againſt thoſe cutaneous diſeaſes, to which the conſtant accumulation of ſordes upon their ſkins in a warm cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, naturally expoſed them. For the ſame reaſon I would ſtrongly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the practice of bathing and ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, frequently in the ſummer ſeaſon. But remember, you ſhould not ſtay too long in the water at one time, leaſt you leſſen inſtead of increaſing the vigour of the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>To all theſe ſpecies of exerciſe which we have mentioned, I would add, SKEATING, JUMPING, alſo, the active plays of TENNIS, BOWLES, QUOITS, GOLF<note n="*" place="bottom">Golf is an exerciſe which is much uſed by the gentlemen in Scotland. A large common, in which there are ſeveral little holes, is choſen for the purpoſe. It is played with little leather balls ſtuffed with feathers; and ſticks tipped with horn. He who puts a ball into a given number of holes, with the feweſt ſtrokes, gets the game. The late Dr. M'KENZIE, Author of the Eſſay on Health and Long Life, uſed to ſay, That a man would live ten years the longer for uſing this exerciſe once or twice a week.</note>, and the like. The manner in

which each of theſe operate, may be underſtood from what we ſaid under the former particulars.</p>
            <p>Active exerciſe includes, in the laſt place, TALKING—READING with an AUDIBLE VOICE——SINGING and LAUGHING. They all promote the circulation of the blood through the lungs, and tend to ſtrengthen thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant organs, when uſed in moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The laſt has the advantage over them all, inaſmuch as the mind co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates with it. May unfading laurels bloom to the lateſt ages upon the grave of him <note n="*" place="bottom">Sterne.</note> who ſaid, "That every time a man laughs, he adds ſomething to his life."</p>
            <p>I would remark here, that all theſe ſpecies of exerciſe which we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, ſhould be varied according to
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023758_0053_0FC0F0C2747BFD48"/>
age—ſex—temperament—climate, and ſeaſon. Young people ſtand in leſs need of exerciſe than old:—Women leſs than men. The natural vigour of their conſtitutions is ſuch, that they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>leaſt</hi> from the want of it. This will explain the meaning, and ſhow the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of an opinion of a modern Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher<note n="†" place="bottom">Rouſſeau.</note>, that "Women only ſhould follow thoſe mechanical arts which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a ſedentary life." But again, a man, who is phlegmatic, requires more frequent and violent exerciſe than he who is of a bilious conſtitution: And laſtly, people in warm climates and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, require leſs than thoſe who live in cold. As Providence, by ſupplying the inhabitants of warm climates with ſo many of the ſpontaneous fruits of the earth, ſeems to have intended they ſhould labour leſs than the inhabitants of cold climates; ſo we may infer from this, that leſs exerciſe, which is only a ſubſtitute for labour, is neceſſary for them. The heat of ſuch climates is ſufficient of itſelf to keep up a regular and due perſpiration. We ſaid in a
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023758_0054_0FC0F0C42F3A1298"/>
former diſcourſe, that the longeſt-lived people were to be found in warm cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, and we gave one conjecture into the cauſe of it. It may not be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per here to add another. The cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of northern climates, from the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour it gives to the conſtitution, prompts to all kinds of exerciſe, which are not always reſtrained within proper bounds. Theſe, when uſed to exceſs, wear out the body. Thus, blowing a fire, may cauſe it to burn the brighter, but it conſumes it the ſooner. The inhabitants of warm climates being leſs prompted to theſe things, their bodies continue longer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impaired. I confine this obſervation, as in the former inſtance, to the improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed parts of Aſia and Africa only. The inhabitants of the Weſt-India iſlands are ſo mixed, and partake ſo much of the European manners, that we cannot as yet include them in any general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks which are made upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p>I come next to ſpeak of thoſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes which are of a PASSIVE NATURE. Theſe are proper chiefly for valetudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narians: but, as I intend theſe ſermons ſhould be of uſe to them as well as the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:023758_0055_0FC0F0C7D7761E68"/>
healthy, I ſhall make a few remarks upon each of them.</p>
            <p>The life of a SAILOR is environed with ſo many dangers, that Heaven has, in compenſation for them, connected with it an exemption from many diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. In vain do the angry elements aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault him. His body, like ſome huge promontory, is proof againſt them all. Notwithſtanding the dangers from ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wreck—fire—falling over-board—and famine, to which ſailors are expoſed, I believe, that if we were to count an hundred ſailors, and the ſame number of people on land, in a place that was ordinarily healthy, we ſhould find more of the former alive at the end of ten years than the latter. The exerciſe of SAILING is conſtant. Every muſcle is occaſionally brought into exerciſe from the efforts we make to keep ourſelves from falling. Theſe efforts continue to be exerted by the oldeſt ſailors, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the conſciouſneſs of the mind in theſe, as well as in many other actions we perform, is not obſerved from the influence of habit. By means of this regular and gentle exerciſe, the blood
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:023758_0056_0FC0F0CBCE033050"/>
is moved in thoſe ſmall capillary veſſels, where it is moſt apt to ſtagnate, and perſpiration is increaſed, which is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried off as faſt as it is diſcharged from the body, by the conſtant change of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere in a ſhip under ſail. I ſay nothing here of the benefit of the ſea air, it being entirely negative. Its vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, both at ſea and on the ſea-ſhore, conſiſts in nothing but its being freed from thoſe noxious animal and vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effluvia, which abound in the air which comes acroſs land. From what has been ſaid, you will no longer be ſurpriſed at the uncommon appetite which ſome people feel at ſea. It is owing to the great and conſtant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the aliment (after it has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone its uſual changes) by means of perſpiration. I would recommend this ſpecies of exerciſe to conſumptive peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, eſpecially to ſuch as labour under a ſpitting of blood. Dr. Lind tells us<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay on the means of preſerving the health of ſeamen.</note>, "That out of 5741 ſailors who were admitted into the naval hoſpital at Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, near Portſmouth, in two years, only
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:023758_0057_0FC0F0CD0E843F60"/>
360 of them had conſumptions, and in one fourth of theſe (he ſays) it was brought on by bruiſes or falls." In the ſame number of hoſpital patients, in this or any other country, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded ſix times that number would have been conſumptive—ſo much does the gentle exerciſe of ſailing fortify the lungs againſt all accidents, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the quantity and force of the flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids towards the ſurface of the body.</p>
            <p>RIDING IN A CHARIOT has but few advantages, inaſmuch as we are exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the benefit of freſh air; an article, upon which the ſucceſs of all kinds of exerciſe in a great meaſure de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. It ſhould be uſed only by ſuch perſons as are unable to walk or to ride on horſeback. We cannot help lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting here, that thoſe people uſe this mode of exerciſe the moſt, who ſtand in the greateſt need of a more violent ſpecies of it.</p>
            <p>RIDING ON HORSEBACK is the moſt manly and uſeful ſpecies of exerciſe for gentlemen. Biſhop Burnet expreſſes his ſurprize at the lawyers of his own
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:023758_0058_0FC0F0D1B3F1D618"/>
time being ſo much more long-lived <hi>(caeteris paribus)</hi> than other people, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering how much thoſe of them who become eminent in their profeſſion, are obliged to devote themſelves to conſtant and intenſe ſtudy. He attributes it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely to their RIDING the circuits ſo frequently, to attend the different courts in every part of the kingdom. This, no doubt, has a chief ſhare in it: but we ſhall hereafter mention another cauſe which concurs with this, to protract their lives. It may be varied according to our ſtrength, or the nature of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, by walking—pacing—trotting or cantering our horſe. All thoſe diſeaſes which are attended with a weakneſs of the nerves, ſuch as the hyſteric and hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriac diſorders, which ſhow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a weakneſs of the ſtomach and bowels—indigeſtion—low ſpirits, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> require this exerciſe. It ſhould be uſed with caution in the conſumption, and ſhould never be violent, nor continued too long at a time. In riding, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve health, eight or ten miles a day are ſufficient to anſwer all the purpoſes we would wiſh for. But in riding, to
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:023758_0059_0FC0F0D311712DF0"/>
reſtore health, theſe little excurſions will avail nothing. The mind, as well as the body, muſt be rouſed from its lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. In <hi>taking an airing,</hi> as it is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, we ride over the ſame ground for the moſt part every day. We ſee no new objects to divert us, and the very conſideration of our riding for health ſinks our ſpirits ſo much, that we receive more harm than good from it. Upon this account I would recommend long journies to ſuch people, in order, by the variety or novelty of the journey, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken and divert the mind. Many people have by theſe means been ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed into health. Perſons who labour under hyſteric or epileptic diſorders, ſhould be ſent to cold, thoſe who labour under hypochondriac or conſumptive complaints ſhould viſit warm climates.</p>
            <p>Before I finiſh this head of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, I ſhall add a few words con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the exerciſe of the faculties of the ſoul. The mind and body have a reciprocal action upon each other. Are our paſſions inflamed with deſire or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion? Or does our reaſon trace out relations in thoſe things which are the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:023758_0060_0FC0F0D9373FE3F0"/>
objects of our underſtanding?—The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, we find, is brought into ſympathy. The pulſe and the circulation of the blood are immediately quickened, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration and the other ſecretions are promoted, and the body is inſenſibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigorated afterwards. The body par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes therefore of the torpor which the mind contracts by its neglecting to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe its faculties. He muſt be but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle acquainted with biography, who has not remarked, that ſuch as have diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed themſelves in the literary world, have generally been long-lived. AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DISON, SWIFT, LOCKE, NEWTON, FRANKLIN, with many others whom we might mention, all found a retreat, in the evening of their lives, under the ſhade of laurels which they had planted in their youth. Perhaps, in moſt caſes, they might promiſe themſelves an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emption from diſeaſes, and a death from mere old age, could they be perſuaded to relinquiſh their midnight lamp be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the oil which feeds it was conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. Great care ſhould be taken, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to avoid too great application of the mind to ſtudy. The moſt powerful
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:023758_0061_0FC0F0DFCE12D438"/>
medicines in nature are the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain poiſons. Many promiſing geniuſes have ſacrificed themſelves, before they arrived at the altar in the Temple of Fame. Such as are in danger of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering from this cauſe, will do well in conſulting the ingenious and humane Dr. Tiſſot's excellent treatiſe upon the diſeaſes of literary people. The PAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIONS, as well as our reaſon, ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be exerciſed as much as poſſible. We ſhall walk, run, dance, ſwim, fence, ſail, and ride to little purpoſe, unleſs we make choice of an agreeable friend to accompany us. Solitude is the bane of man; inſomuch, that it is difficult to tell which ſuffers moſt, the ſoul in its qualities, or the body in its tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from being alone. Too great a concourſe of people breeds diſeaſes. Too much company is deſtructive to cheerfulneſs. For the ſake of both mind and body, therefore, we ſhould move in a little circle, and let heaven circumſcribe it for us. Let over wives and children be always around us, or, if we are not bleſſed with theſe, let a few chearful friends be our conſtant
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:023758_0062_0FC0F0E14C1EA940"/>
companions. It is remarked, that more ſingle people die among thoſe who are come to manhood than married, and all phyſicians agree, that ſingle men and women compoſe by far the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their chronic patients among a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dults. Some men may talk againſt the cares of a family. They are unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, it is true, but they are neceſſary. Stagnating waters are never ſweet.— Thus, theſe little cares, by keeping the tender paſſions always agitated, prevent that uniformity in life, which is ſo fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and diſagreeable both to the body and mind. After all, I believe I ſhall have the ſuffrages of moſt of my hearers, when I add, that they are at leaſt ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced by the ſweets of domeſtic friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
            <p>We come now to the next head of our diſcourſe, namely,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To enquire into the proper TIME for EXERCISES.—Sanctorius informs us<note place="bottom">Sect. V. Aphoriſm VII.</note>, that "exerciſe, from the ſeventh to the eleventh hour after eating, waſtes more inſenſibly in one hour, than in three at
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:023758_0063_0FC0F0E22A4BCA10"/>
any other time." If this be true, then (ſuppoſing you ſup at eight o'clock in the evening) that exerciſe which is uſed from five till ſeven o'clock in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will promote the greateſt diſcharge in a given time, by inſenſible perſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such as make dinner their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal meal, are excluded from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of this aphoriſm; as the interval, between the ſeventh and the eleventh hour, with them (ſuppoſing they dine at two o'clock in the afternoon) is from nine in the evening till one o'clock in the morning—a time, in which darkneſs, and the unwholeſome night air, forbid walking—riding—and almoſt every o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpecies of manly exerciſe we have deſcribed.</p>
            <p>I know it will be objected here, that we often ſee labourers return, after a full meal, to their work, without feeling any inconvenience from it. This is like the argument of thoſe who recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend raw fleſh to the human ſpecies, becauſe the ſtrongeſt and fierceſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals in nature eat it. It is becauſe they are ſo fierce and ſo ſtrong, that they are able to digeſt raw ſtein. In like
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:023758_0064_0FC0F0E8C12AB4C0"/>
manner it is, becauſe theſe men are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ſo ſtrong, that labour immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after eating does not hurt them<note n="*" place="bottom">O! dura meſſorum ilia. <hi>Hor. Epod. III.</hi>
               </note>. But let me aſk, whether you have not obſerved ſuch people leave their tables with reluctance?—how ſlowly do they return—and how many excuſes do they form to loitor away a little time, before they renew their work?</p>
            <p>But further—there is another reaſon why I would recommend this practice of eating the chief meal in the evening, which is indeed a little foreign to our preſent ſubject.—In a country like this, where the conſtant labour of every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual is ſo very neceſſary, the general uſe of this cuſtom would add ſeveral hours to every day, and thus have the moſt beneficial effects upon the agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—commerce—and manufactures of the country, excluſive of its influence upon the health of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>After what has been ſaid, I need hardly add, that exerciſe ſhould never be uſed with a full ſtomach. Perſons who uſe exerciſe, either to preſerve or
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:023758_0065_0FC0F0E98F8D1FF8"/>
reſtore health, immediately after eating a hearty meal, reſemble the man "who fled from a lion, and a bear met him; and who went into the houſe, and lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his hand upon the wall, and a ſerpent bit him."</p>
            <p>I come now to the APPLICATION of this diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured, in every part of it, to lay before you the moſt powerful arguments, to excite you to exerciſe, and have addreſſed them chiefly to that main ſpring of human actions—SELF-PRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERVATION. I have taught you the true art of alchymy, and furniſhed you with the genuine philoſopher's ſtone; but with this difference from that which has been ſought for, by the deluded pretenders of philoſophy in all ages, that, inſtead of converting, like Midas, every thing you touch into gold, every thing which touches you ſhall—not convert you into gold, but impart HEALTH to you—compared with which, even the gold of Ophir loſes its weight. In a word—I have ſhowed you an harbour where I have anchored ſafely for many
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:023758_0066_0FC0F0ED7677F070"/>
years; for, from my youth upwards, I have followed the mode of living I have recommended to you, as far as my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections or intercourſe with the world would admit; and although I received from nature a weakly conſtitution, yet —I ſpeak it with a grateful heart!— few men enjoy better health—none bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſpirits—than myſelf; and was I now about to leave the world, ſurrounded with a family of children, I would charge them, among the moſt important leſſons I ſhould give them, to bind theſe things as "a ſign upon their hands, or as front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs between their eyes"—to think of them "when they ſat in their houſes, and when they walked by the way— when they lay down, and when they roſe up—that their days might be mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied; and that the days of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren might be as the days of heaven upon the earth."</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this diſcourſe with a ſtory, which, I hope, will not be looked upon as foreign to what has been deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p>In the iſland of Ceylon, in the Indian ocean, a number of invalids were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:023758_0067_0FC0F0F15F5B0DC8"/>
together, who were afflicted with moſt of the chronic diſeaſes to which the human body is ſubject. In the midſt of them ſat ſeveral venerable figures, who amuſed them with encomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums upon ſome medicines, which they aſſured them would afford infallible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in all caſes. One boaſted of an elixir—another of a powder, brought from America—a third, of a medicine, invented and prepared in Germany— all of which, they ſaid, were certain antidotes for the gout—a fourth cried up a noſtrum for the vapours—a fifth, drops for the gravel—a ſixth, a balſam, prepared from honey, as a ſovereign remedy for a conſumption—a ſeventh, a pill for cutaneous eruptions—while an eighth cried down the whole, and extolled a mineral water, which lay a few miles from the place where they were aſſembled. The credulous mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude partook eagerly of theſe medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, but without any relief of their reſpective complaints. Several of thoſe, who made uſe of the German preparation, were hurried ſuddenly out of the world. Some ſaid their medicines were adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:023758_0068_0FC0F0F65ED50548"/>
—others that the doctors had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken their diſorders—while moſt of them agreed that they were much worſe than ever. While they were all, with one accord, giving vent in this manner, to the tranſports of diſappointment and vexation, a clap of thunder was heard over their heads. Upon looking up, a light was ſeen in the ſky.—In the midſt of this appeared the figure of ſomething more than human—ſhe was tall and comely—her ſkin was fair as the driven ſnow—a roſy hue tinged her cheeks— her hair hung looſe upon her ſhoulders— her flowing robes diſcloſed a ſhape which would have caſt a ſhade upon the ſtatue of Venus of Medicis.—In her right hand ſhe held a bough of an EVERGREEN —in her left hand ſhe had a ſcroll of parchment—ſhe deſcended ſlowly, and ſtood erect upon the earth—ſhe fixed her eyes, which ſparkled with life, upon the deluded and afflicted company— there was a mixture of pity and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in her countenance—ſhe ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth her right arm, and, with a voice which was ſweeter than melody itſelf, ſhe addreſſed them in the following
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:023758_0069_0FC0F0F7F38FD058"/>
language: <q>Ye children of men, liſten for a while to the voice of inſtruction. Ye ſeek health where it is not to be found. The boaſted ſpecifies you have been uſing, have no virtues. Even the perſons who gave them, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under many of the diſorders they attempt to cure. My name is HYGIAEA. I preſide over the health of mankind. Diſcard all your medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, and ſeek relief from Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Exerciſe alone. Every thing you ſee is active around you. All the brute animals in nature are active in their inſtinctive purſuits. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate nature is active too: air—fire —and water—are always in motion. Unleſs this were the caſe, they would ſoon be unfit for the purpoſes they were deſigned to ſerve in the oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of nature. Shun ſloth. This unhinges all the ſprings of life—fly from your diſeaſes—they will not— they cannot purſue.</q> Here ſhe end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—ſhe dropped the parchment upon the earth—a cloud received her, and ſhe immediately aſcended and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared from their ſight.—A ſilence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:023758_0070_0FC0F0FEF58A3510"/>
—more expreſſive of approbation than the loudeſt peals of applauſe. One of them approached with reverence to the ſpot where ſhe ſtood—took up the ſcroll, and read the contents of it to his companions. It contained directions to each of them, what they ſhould do to reſtore their health. They all prepared themſelves to obey the advice of the heavenly viſion. The gouty man broke his vial of elixir, threw his powders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, and walked four or five miles every day before breakfaſt. The man afflicted with the gravel threw aſide his drops, and began to work in his garden, or to play two or three hours every day at bowls. The hypochondriac and hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teric patients diſcharged their boxes of aſſafoetida, and took a journey on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, to diſtant and oppoſite ends of the iſland. The melancholic threw aſide his gloomy ſyſtems of philoſophy, and ſent for a dancing-maſter. The ſtudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous man ſhut up his folios, and ſought amuſement from the ſports of children. The leper threw away his mercurial pills, and ſwam every day in a neighbouring river. The consumptive man threw
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:023758_0071_0FC0F1001604F680"/>
his balſam out of his window, and took a voyage to a diſtant country. After ſome months, they all returned to the place they were wont to aſſemble in. Joy appeared in each of their countenances. One had renewed his youth—another had recovered the uſe of his limbs—a third, who had been half bent for many years, now walked upright—a fourth began to ſing ſome jovial ſong, without being aſked—a fifth could talk for hours together without being interrupted with a cough—in a word, they all enjoyed now a complete recovery of their health. They joined in offering ſacrifices to HY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIAEA. Temples were erected to her memory; and ſhe continues, to this day, to be worſhipped by all the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of that iſland.</p>
