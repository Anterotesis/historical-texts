            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>ABOUT a fortnight ago a large packet was dropped in my ſtore in the duſk of the evening, as I ſuppoſe. It remained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noticed till next morning, when, happening to perceive it, I opened it, and, amongſt other written papers, found a letter directed to me, which is ſubjoined.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of that day and the next, I occaſionally dipped into the papers; but as to ſell books, not to criticiſe them, is my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, all I ſhall ſay is, that the ſtyle, if we conſider that the work is but a tranſlation, is tolerably ſmooth and eaſy; and the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (due allowance being made for the diſpoſition and education of an Algerine) are not unworthy of the public attention.</p>
            <p>As theſe ſtates abound in critics equal to any in the world, it may be preſumed, that ſome of them will condeſcend to read the book which they criticiſe. If theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men will favour me with their remarks, they
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:020481_0005_0FAF13272B3245F8"/>
ſhall be added, by way of appendix, to the third or fourth impreſſion. This addition will increaſe the value of the work, by ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering it at once more bulky and amuſing.</p>
            <p>I confeſs that, although a bookſeller, I am not fond of large volumes. A huge folio has an impoſing air of dignity, which is very apt to deter people from having any thing to ſay to it, as my ſhelves can teſtify; but a ſnug little pocket volume, neatly bound and lettered, is like an eaſy good natured friend, who is ready to ſit down with us near a good fire, or to take a walk on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. If we happen to be otherwiſe engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we part from the one, or pocket the other, without trouble or ceremony.</p>
            <p>As for the Algerine gentleman, I declare upon the word of a faithful citizen, that I do not know him. If he has ever favoured me with his cuſtom, I am highly obliged to him, and, when he gets rid of his melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſhall be happy in preſenting him with a copy of the work and a glaſs of wine into
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:020481_0006_0FB0E4BA00BA8DD0"/>
the bargain, which, as he is now a good chriſtian, I hope he will not refuſe.</p>

            <p>AS the publication of the herewith en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed letters will probably excite ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of curioſity concerning <hi>MEHEMET,</hi> the ſpy, I wiſh it were in my power to gratify it. The letters, written in different lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, but chiefly in Arabic, were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into my hands with a note, which contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a requeſt that I ſhould tranſlate and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh them for the good of the United States. They were all without dates, which omiſſion will be excuſed, when it is conſidered that they are but copies; but the principal facts mentioned in them are ſo notorious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that dates ſeem unneceſſary.</p>
            <p>Whether they will either inſtruct or amuſe, I will not pretend to ſay; but I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that they will do no harm. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerine ſpy, although as ſuch inexcuſable, is by no means an indecent or immoral writer.</p>

               <p>WHEN I parted from thee, a train of ideas, at once melancholy and pleaſing, took poſſeſſion of my mind. I was conſcious, that I had undertaken an office of the higheſt conſequence to my country and the Muſſelman faith; that, if ſucceſsful, I ſhould rank with thoſe, who have gained immortal honour in this world, and the joys of Paradiſe; that, if unſucceſsful, I ſhould ſuffer diſgrace and impriſonment, (death I diſregard) pitied by men of ſenſibility and inſulted by fools and knaves. I ingenuouſly confeſs, that I was greatly dejected; but was relieved from this anxiety of mind (if relief it
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020481_0009_0FB0E4C17A33B820"/>
could be called) by the moſt diſtreſſing ſickneſs I had ever experienced. My head grew giddy; a nauſea ſucceeded; large drops of cold ſweat iſſued from every pore; with difficulty I ſtaggerd to my bed, and, claſping my hands, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended my ſoul to Allah. I ſlumbered, as I ſuppoſe, about four hours; when, finding myſelf conſiderably better, I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured on deck.</p>
               <p>To thee, who, from a very early period of thy life, haſt been accuſtomed to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and perils on this turbulent element, this account of my ſea-ſickneſs will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear perfectly ridiculous. If I expected to excite compaſſion, I would have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed this letter to the gallant leader of our warlike troops, or the venerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of our moſt holy law. The firſt has often experienced dangers in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of arms, and the no leſs perilous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of a court; but I am confident, that his tremors have been greater du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a voyage to Conſtantinople, than when expoſed to the roaring cannon or the equally deſtructive whiſpers of court-ſycophants.

<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020481_0011_0FB0E4C477B8C158"/>
The laſt has never been at ſea; but he has often read with exquiſite ſenſibility the deſcription of a voyage by the royal Iſraelite.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not trouble thee with a minute account of my diſtreſſes during the whole voyage; the offenſive ſinell and taſte of the water; the roughneſs of the captain, which I at firſt miſtook for brutality, or the ſneers of the ſailors, who, having been informed that I was a Frenchman, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded me with eyes at once expreſſive of hatred and contempt.</p>
               <p>Thou muſt remember, that when my propoſal of embarking for the American continent was accepted, it was ſuggeſted to me to appear in the character of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the ſouth of France. My know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the French language, the predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the citizens of the new ſtates for their allies, and the ſwarthineſs of my complexion, induced me to follow this advice. This circumſtance expoſed me to the inſults which I have juſt mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the conſciouſneſs of the weighty
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020481_0012_0FB0E4C7A188E278"/>
commiſſion, with which I was charged, repreſſed my reſentment. I converſed with them freely in Engliſh, which I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand perfectly and ſpeak with tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fluency; and very ſoon conciliated their favour. They partook of my wine, and liberally offered me their grog, which is a mixture of water and a ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, highly eſteemed by the inhabitants of the new world. The diſpenſation, which I obtained, permitting me to drink wine, muſt, I think, include all ferment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and even diſtilled liquors. But as wine only is mentioned, I beg you will conſult our great ſpiritual guide on this occaſion, and inform me of his ſacred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination.</p>
               <p>After a ſhort voyage I landed yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day in the bay under a promontory, which with a diſdainful ſuperiority, looks down on the ocean, and even its brother Ceuta on the oppoſite coaſt. It has been in the poſſeſſion of the Engliſh more than eighty years, who took it from the Spaniards, and, notwithſtanding ſeveral attacks and ſieges, are ſtill maſters of it.</p>

But their accuſations would have ceaſed, had they conſidered, that this Pillar of Hercules is no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prop of Britiſh opulence and glory.</p>
               <p>I lodge in the houſe of Solomon Mendez, a Jewiſh merchant, to whom I brought letters of introduction, and ſhall ſoon embark for Liſbon, from which port I ſhall take paſſage for the new world.</p>

               <p>IT may be diſputed, whether the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of this rock has been beneficial to Great Britain. The expence of defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it has been perhaps greater than the commercial advantages derived from it. But it is undoubtedly true, that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Porte and its dependencies in the Mediterranean, are highly intereſted in its continuing under its preſent maſters. No true Spaniard can behold it without indignation, and conſequently a wiſh, that it ſhould be reunited to the kingdom from which it was violently rent, and has been ignominiouſly retained. It has been, I believe, the principal ſource of enmity betwixt Spain and Britain, ſince it was conquered, and has induced the former nation to co-operate with France in all her plans for reducing the power of the latter. Spain, if repoſſeſſed of Gibraltar, would probably abate of her attachment to France, to whoſe views, it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,

ſhe has long been blindly ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient. The loſs of that vaſt tract of country in America, now called the United States, by diminiſhing the power of Britain in that quarter of the globe, has leſſened the terrors, and conſequently the enmity of Spain. A new nation has ſtarted up in America, which, if actuated by ambition, (and what power has long reſiſted its impulſe) may invade, haraſs and ſubjugate ſeveral of the Spaniſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. The enthuſiaſm of the invaders, the debility of the invaded, the poverty of the ſtates and the wealth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, will render the conqueſt of Peru and Mexico by no means difficult. The Bourbon union already regards the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican confederacy with a jealous eye, and will never forgive this new people for having it in their power to attack their poſſeſſions in the weſt, although the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation may be reſiſted for a long ſeries of years.</p>
               <p>The wars amongſt the chriſtian powers have generally, I might ſay invariably, promoted the intereſt of the Ottoman
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:020481_0017_0FB0E4D0E296EB60"/>
empire. Here then is a certain ſource of animoſity, which muſt advance the ſplendor and power of the Porte, and may reſtore thouſands of Mooriſh fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies to the poſſeſſion of their eſtates in the fertile, but neglected provinces of Spain.</p>
               <p>You muſt here permit me to make a ſhort digreſſion in favour of toleration. Had Spain, when ſhe threw off the Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh yoke, permitted thoſe people to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their religion, ſhe would ſtill have held the firſt rank amongſt the powers of Europe. Moderation would have recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled our forefathers, or, at all events, their immediate offspring, to the ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Nazarenes. They were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly an induſtrious, as well as a brave and intelligent people. Their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion weakened Spain at leaſt as much, as the baniſhment of the proteſtants re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the internal reſources of France in the reign of Lewis the XIVth. I ſhall not attempt a regular diſſertation on the fatal effects of religious intolerance; but ſhall only remind thee, that the followers of Mahomet have been more indulgent
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020481_0018_0FB0E4D3106868B0"/>
to thoſe who profeſs chriſtianity, than the different ſects of chriſtians have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been to each other.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that there are ſchiſms even in our holy religion. The diſciples of Hali (not to mention inferior ſects) differ in ſome particulars from the followers of our prophet; but we defy the moſt virulent chriſtian to prove, that either the Ottoman or Perſian govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has racked, burned, or even impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned, on a religious account, thoſe who diſſent from the eſtabliſhed mode of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in theſe reſpective countries. Some brutal Turks and Perſians have been known, it is true, to ſpeak inſultingly to, and even ſpit upon, a chriſtian in the ſtreets. But in all poſſible caſes the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſers of juſtice never fail to redreſs the injury by puniſhing the aggreſſor. Here then lies the difference between maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans and chriſtians in this particular; the rabble amongſt us are ſometimes guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of religious rancour; but in chriſtian countries, perſecution always proceeds from thoſe who are, or at leaſt are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020481_0019_0FB0E4D44DE8F190"/>
to be, the moſt enlightened. What glory to the generous followers of the bold and intrepid Mahomet! What diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to the pretended diſciples of the meek and humble Jeſus!</p>

               <p>MY hoſt, I have already informed thee, is a Jew. Thou wilt conſequently ſuppoſe him to be guilty of thoſe vices too generally attributed to his degenerate nation. Thoſe, of whom thou haſt any knowledge, living under a government which deſpiſes, inſults, and even robs them of the fruits of their induſtry, are neceſſarily reſerved in their converſation and auſtere in their domeſtic concerns. If poor, they are ſcoffed at by the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace; if rich, they are plundered by their ſuperiors. But in Gibraltar (and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve throughout the Britiſh dominions) they are as fully protected as any other denomination of men. They are, it is true, excluded by law from all the offices of ſtate, nor can they purchaſe lands. But as their commerce is extenſive, their influence is by no means inconſiderable. Their immenſe property in the national
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020481_0021_0FB0E4DA95101ED0"/>
funds gives them a degree of weight equally advantageous to themſelves and the public. They are by intereſt, the ſtrongeſt of all ties, attached to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which protects them, and by their correſpondence with each other, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever widely diſperſed, are enabled to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect intelligence of all the deſigns of fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign cabinets. It may occaſion ſome aſtoniſhment, that Britain, which liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encourages their commercial enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhould preclude them from poſſeſſing landed property. I will not ſay, that this prohibition proceeds altogether from wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; but I am induced to think, that it has been productive of the happieſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. If the Hebrews had been permitted to purchaſe lands, many of them would have become mere farmers; an uſeful race of men, I confeſs, but on a narrow ſcale, if compared with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. The cultivator of the earth in a country not arrived at maturity, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably the firſt character; but in a more advanced ſtate of ſociety he muſt yield to the merchant. In the former ſtate the landholder aſſiſts his country
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020481_0022_0FB0E4DC7B8409C8"/>
ſimply by his own exertions, or thoſe of his immediate relatives, and may be juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deemed a patriot; in the latter, the merchant, by advancing the credit of his nation and often by depreſſing that of the enemy, by a few ſtrokes of his pen creates fleets and armies, and often without bloodſhed inſures ſucceſs. He is equally a patriot and more of the ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man than the landholder.</p>
               <p>Our imagination is highly delighted, when we read the hiſtories of ancient Greece and Rome. We are dazzled by the ſplendor of their victories, and are apt to attribute more praiſe to them, than they deſerve. But Alexander, at the head of united and victorious Greece, paid the higheſt tribute to the utility of commerce. If, in the madneſs of falſe heroiſm, he deſtroyed Tyre, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to repair the injury by founding Alexandria; and Rome, incapable, by her genius, of commercial greatneſs, was long retarded in her progreſs to univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal dominion by the policy, wealth and valour of Carthage. Hence this ſtate
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020481_0023_0FB0E4DE06311158"/>
was entitled to her particular hatred; others ſhe merely conquered and enſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but Carthage ſhe utterly deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>It might be entertaining, and perhaps uſeful, to trace the probable progreſs of Carthaginian power, if, in the laſt Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic war, ſhe had ſubdued her imperious rival. Poſſeſſed, at that time, of a very lucrative commerce, ſhe would have aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at extending it. Conqueſt would have been but her ſecondary object. Her daring navigators had already viſited all the diſcovered parts of the world, and had made conſiderable progreſs along the coaſt of Africa, lying on the Atlantic ocean, towards the equator. After a few more attempts, they would have doubled the cape of Good Hope, and the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the eaſt would have rewarded her beneficial induſtry. That nation, which the ſilver mines of Spain, at that time the Mexico of Europe, could not corrupt or enervate, would have proſecuted her plan with the genuine ſpirit of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, which encourages a degree of foreign induſtry, as the reward of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020481_0024_0FB0E4DF89D1BBA0"/>
ſkill and exertion. Her factories would have increaſed to cities; theſe cities, by a happy contagion, would have acquired over the adjacent countries a ſpecies of dominion, which, being found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on mutual benefits, would have no leſs advanced the intereſts, than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliated the affection of the original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. War, as I have ſaid, would have been moderately attended to. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed from the dread of a rival, ſhe would have levied armies and equipped fleets ſolely to maintain (allow me the expreſſion) the police of the world.</p>

               <p>I HAVE given thee an imaginary ſketch of the probable power of Carthage, (if ſhe had ſubdued her rival) a name, which ought to be mentioned in the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Africa with no leſs honour than Egypt herſelf. Let us now review the effects, which the ambition of Rome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in the human character.</p>
               <p>That nation, which boaſted its origin from the union of robbers, was neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, even in its infancy, incited to war by the hope of plunder. Incapable of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and confined within very narrow limits, the Romans could not exiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſtreſſing their neighbours. Having eſtabliſhed a place of refuge for malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, their numbers rapidly increaſed by the acceſſion of all the banditti of Italy. Their firſt chief was ſuppoſed to have been the ſon of Mars. His actions cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded with his pretended birth. The
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020481_0026_0FB0E4E4B970F4C0"/>
murder of his brother inſpired his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with the higheſt opinion of his hero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm. Who more fit to reign, ſaid they, than he, who is not reſtrained by the ties of nature? This ſentiment pervaded all their deſigns, and was infuſed into their children. It was glorious not only to die for their country, but to aſſaſſinate their enemies, and even to kill their own offspring.</p>
               <p>Thou art ſenſible, that I am not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging a romantic fancy. Every page of the earlier part of their hiſtory is ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with inſidious aſſaſſination or open murder. A Scaevola is recorded as a hero, for having thruſt into the flames the hand which failed to murder a king at open war with his nation; and a Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus is exalted to almoſt divine honors for having condemned to die two of his ſons, whom the laws of his country might have baniſhed without his unnatural interven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But thou wilt ſay, that the Romans were, at the period I allude to, emerging
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020481_0027_0FB0E4E636E1BE60"/>
from barbariſm; that great ſouls, unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened by found philoſophy and true religion, are neceſſarily guilty of exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. That they were barbarians at this period, is granted; but let me aſk thee, at what time were they enlightened? Their kings, with the ſole exception of Numa, were the worthy leaders of the greateſt deſperados we read of. Their perpetual wars in Italy (I might have called them maſſacres) ought to have united the whole world againſt them, as the peſts of human nature.</p>
               <p>Nor can we attribute their ferocious exploits to the examples of their kings. After the regal authority was aboliſhed, their ambition was inſatiable. Italy ſoon became too narrow a ſpace for their cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and thirſt of falſe glory. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled Pyrrhus, who had brought ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to his allies, the Tarentines, they attacked Sicily, at that time allied with Carthage. This war rouſed the Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians, who being hitherto chiefly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in commercial purſuits, or engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in war as an inferior object, could not
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020481_0028_0FB0E4E7CB9EABA0"/>
behold the encroachments and uſurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Romans without feeling a juſt reſentment. They armed, they fought; and after experiencing triumphs as well as defeats, were exterminated by their ungenerous rivals.</p>
               <p>Thus fell Carthage, the emporium of commerce, the nurſery of humanity! And ſo implacable was the fury of her conquerors, or ſo deſtructive have been the ravages of time, that the works of her artiſts, and the writings of her poets, ſtateſmen and philoſophers are no where to be found, except the comedies of Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and the Periplous of Hanno.</p>
               <p>Perhaps I have heightened this picture from a predilection for a people, who were the ornament of Africa, and maſters of the place of my nativity; but I am of opinion, that every impartial perſon who reviews the Roman hiſtory with the eye of philoſophy, muſt execrate the inſidious policy and unbounded ambition of that reſtleſs and domineering people.</p>

               <p>ALTHOUGH comfortably lodged, I am impatient to enter on my office; but am doubtful, whether I ſhall take, paſſage from ſome port in France for America, or from Liſbon. In the mean time my hoſt, to whom alone the object of my travels is known, endeavours to render my abode in this place as agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as poſſible. He has introduced me to all his acquaintance, ſome of whom are men of letters; the reſt are mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants. His wife, although ſufficiently domeſticated, partakes of all the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the place; ſhe viſits, and is vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited by, ſeveral reſpectable families. In deportment an Algerine, a Frenchman in dreſs and language, I was at firſt the object of their amazement; but after the ſecond viſit it abated, and I am no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the theme of their whiſpers. Accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to women who are reſerved, baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:020481_0030_0FB0E4EE939419A8"/>
and timid, I at firſt bluſhed when ſpoken to and anſwered their queſtions with diffidence and heſitation. Strange, thought I that the man, who, in his haram, inſpired awe and even terror, ſhould in his turn, be awed into ſilence, and ſhrink from the eye of female ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation! But I ſoon ſuppreſſed theſe unmanly feelings, and entered into the ſpirit of their converſation, which was decent and lively.</p>
               <p>Thou wilt probably be amuſed with an account of our converſation. We were ſeated in a large room, which was rendered as cool as poſſible by a free ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of air; but the ladies, whoſe conſtitutions, I preſume, were more ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of heat, than thoſe of the men, kept fanning themſelves perpetually, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, at every pauſe in the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, of the intenſe heat of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They frequently roſe from their ſeats with ſeeming hurry, and, ſtepping haſtily to a mirror, adjuſted their neck-dreſſes with the greateſt compoſure. Their converſation was as unguarded,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:020481_0031_0FB0E4F00F7F9720"/>
as their looks and motions. They ſpoke of their abſent friends without reſerve, and ſometimes with acrimony; that a matron was anxious to be divorced from her huſband, and that a virgin was eager to elope with her lover. I heard with aſtoniſhment more than three female voices at a time. A diſcourſe directed to one lady, was interrupted by another, and the half-uttered queſtion was muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the premature anſwer. A lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog occaſionally attracted their notice, which, by turns, they fondled, kiſſed and even ſpoke to with all the rapture of maternal tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>This ſcene, which, if related to me, I ſhould ſcarcely have believed, was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by a man, ſuperbly, but fanciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dreſt, bearing in both hands an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long japanned machine, on which ſeveral beautiful veſſels were arranged, filled with a ſmoaking liquid. Imagining him to be one of the gueſts, I roſe from my ſeat and bowed to him according to the Nazarene faſhion. A roar of laughter proceeded from the females, and even
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:020481_0032_0FB0E4F5B64CE8D0"/>
gentlemen could ſcarcely abſtain from ſmiling, whilſt a bluſh of ſenſibility over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the cheek of the attendant; for ſuch I now diſcovered him to be. He preſented the japanned utenſil to each of the company in turn, who took hold of a ſpecies of plate which ſupported the veſſel, filled with the hot liquor. This was ſipped by all the company with evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent marks of ſatisfaction, although but a few minutes before they had all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of the intenſe heat of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Having attentively obſerved the ceremonial, I was not at a loſs how to act. But as the attendant approached me, his bluſhes were renewed and the laugh was repeated, although not ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreperouſly as at firſt. Juſt at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant a boy entered in great agitation, and whiſpered his buſineſs in the ear of a lady, who was obſerved immediately to turn pale. A dozen eſſence-bottles were inſtantly applied to her noſtrile, and as many fans were in motion. I was truly diſtreſſed for the lady; but what was my ſurpriſe, when I was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that her fainting was occaſioned by
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:020481_0033_0FB0E4FB3A6D7178"/>
a misfortune, which had happened to her monkey, who, in attempting to climb a tree, had fallen and ſlipped his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. She ſighed, wept and wrung her hands, whilſt tears of ſympathy trickled down the cheek of theſe tender hearted ladies. At length the fair mourner, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by two of her particular friends, was conducted to an inner apartment in all the dignity of ſorrow. I embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced this opportunity of retiring to my apartment, by no means edified by a company where the abſent had been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligned, a ſtranger inſulted, and a dog careſſed; and where more ſorrow had been laviſhed on a monkey, than would have been felt for an expiring child.</p>
               <p>How different, my friend, are theſe women from the beloved of my ſoul; who is more intent to hear, than eager to ſpeak; who, ſatisfied with my love, aims not at the admiration of others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with whom ſilence is wiſdom and reſerve is virtue!</p>

               <p>AS ſoon as the company had retired, my friend entered my apartment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me with great delicacy, that the aukwardneſs of my deportment had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the gentlemen to make very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enquiries concerning me; that he had however ſatisfied their curioſity by informing them, that I was a French gentleman, addicted to ſtudy and fond of retirement; that in ſome of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which I brought with me, hints were given him of an apprehended de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement in my intellects, to prevent which, travelling had been preſcribed by my phyſicians; but that, for his part, he believed I was only a philoſopher. I thanked him for this explanation of my behaviour, and am determined to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove upon the idea in my travels.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="unknown:020481_0035_0FB0E4FEF8DE51B0"/>At ſupper I was introduced to a Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi, highly eſteemed for his probity and admired for his learning. In the courſe of our converſation, I diſcovered, that he entertained a very exalted opinion of his own underſtanding, and was by no means willing, that his abilities ſhould be overlooked by others. The diſguſt, occaſioned by the tender hearted ladies, was now worn off, and I felt myſelf diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to reliſh abſurdities of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>I happened to mention, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age was greatly indebted to ancient Greece for literature and ſcience, and beſtowed ſome encomiums on Ariſtotle. At the name of this celebrated philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher I obſerved the cheek of the Rabbi to glow with indignation. "That Ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>totle, cried he, has enlightened the world, I readily acknowledge; but it is well known from whom he derived his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He attended his pupil, Alexander the Great, in his conqueſt of the Eaſt, and after the taking of Jeruſalem, was intruſted with the writings of Solomon
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020481_0036_0FB0E507F9F93790"/>
and the reſt of our ſages, which the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites had preſerved in the temple. From theſe volumes he extracted that maſs of knowledge, which he publiſhed as his own, and then deſtroyed the originals." This inſtance of national pride reminded me of a ſtory, pretended to be believed in the Weſt; that an apoſtate Monk and a profligate Jew compoſed the ſacred al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koran, which our illuſtrious prophet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulgated for the benefit of the elect. How confirmed in error muſt that infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del be, who can utter ſo improbable a fiction?</p>
               <p>The Jews are, I think, the principal merchants in Gibraltar; but may it not be aſked, in what part of the world, where they are on a footing with the reſt of the inhabitants, are they not the moſt induſtrious and wealthy part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity? Wholly employed in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, they always educate their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for the mercantile profeſſion. We rarely find young perſons among them, who aim at applauſe by a contemptible diſplay of unneceſſary literature or ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial

As pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is their characteriſtic. they are more ſolid than ſhining. They are no longer the object of religious fury. Even Spain is become tolerant, and Portugal has ceaſed to be barbarous.

               <p>It may be reaſonably ſuppoſed, that the genius of the Hebrews, which for ages has been oppreſſed by the rude hand of fanaticiſm, will now ſpread and flouriſh anew. Every nation, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects them, is entitled to their exertions. But whilſt they promote the good of the country where they reſide, by a benefici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al commerce, they ought not to neglect thoſe arts, which, by adorning, improve human nature. Agriculture is ready to reward their induſtry a hundred fold; their lutes and harps need not continue

               <p>MY hoſt is very deſirous of giving me an inſight into the manners and amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Nazarenes, that they may not appear altogether ſtrange to me on my arrival in the new world. He is ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the object of my tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, and will doubtleſs be ſecret, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is his intereſt to be ſo. To have attempted an enterpriſe of this nature, without imparting the ſecret to at leaſt two foreigners, would have been little ſhort of madneſs. Although an oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt by nature and habit, I may require more money than the ſum I ſhall take with me. To draw bills in the new ſtates on a merchant at Algiers would expoſe me to inevitable deſtruction, either from their government or the populace. I have therefore ſettled a mode of corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with Solomon Mendez at this place, and ſhall make ſimilar arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments at Liſbon with Moſes d'Acoſta.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:020481_0040_0FAF12A404BB8470"/>It may be aſked, as I travel in the character of a French gentleman, why I have not eſtabliſhed a correſpondence with ſome mercantile houſe in France? To this I anſwer, that, although it is right, for many reaſons, to aſſume the character of a Frenchman, I think it highly dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to intruſt my ſecret with any of that nation. An affected or real attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to theſe new republicans, the hope of conciliating their favour, or the dread of his own government, might induce a Frenchman to betray me. Even the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of being the ſubject of public diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe might ſtimulate him to my ruin. But from Jews I apprehend no manner of danger. They will not betray me from either patriotiſm or vanity. Their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate intereſt will prompt them to be faithful, and they have much to hope from my future patronage in Algiers.</p>
               <p>I might immediately proceed through a part of Spain to Liſbon; but I ſhall be leſs expoſed to diſcovery by taking paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage in an Engliſh veſſel. The mariners of that nation are rough and unſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020481_0041_0FAF12A4F1ECE240"/>
When they hear I am a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, they will conclude they know the worſt of me.</p>
               <p>I had written thus far, when I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited down ſtairs to partake of the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a ball. I accepted the invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for two reaſons. I am ſuppoſed to be a Frenchman; and a refuſal might have brought my country into queſtion. I am going to the American ſtates; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neceſſary that I ſhould be as much acquainted as poſſible with the Engliſh faſhions.</p>
               <p>On my entering the room, I made a low bow (a circumſtance I am careful never to forget) and ſeated myſelf in a chair, which ſeparated two matrons, whoſe reſpectable countenances challenged that veneration, which from their dreſs and behaviour they ſeemed unwilling to claim. The hot liquid, which is called tea, was handed round in the manner, which I have already deſcribed. They drank it, becauſe, I preſume, they were cold; and they fanned themſelves immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:020481_0042_0FAF12A5F4D65248"/>
becauſe, I am confident, they were hot. The conteſt betwixt the tea and the fan continued for ſome time. At length the tea retired, and the fan, which had received great aſſiſtance from the handkerchief, remained maſter of the field. The muſicians now entered, and, having neglected to tune their inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments before their admiſſion, reminded me of the diſcordant harmony mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by one of the Roman poets. But this was probably done from the view of rendering by the contraſt their muſic doubly agreeable. The inſtruments being now ready, I looked round with ſome impatience for the dancing girls, who, I ſuppoſed, were ready in the next room. In the mean time, a young gentleman, approaching with a hat in his hand, made me a low bow. I thought, I could do no leſs than make him another. He bowed again, and proceeded to another gentleman, who, after giving and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a bow, took the hat, and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with becoming gravity towards one of the matrons, between whom I was ſeated, bowed to her. To convince the
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:020481_0043_0FAF12A6795A9630"/>
company, that ſhe was both young and active, ſhe roſe from her ſeat with ſuch agility, that her aſcending boſom and his deſcending noſe were almoſt in contact. The gentleman threw back his right leg, and, drawing his left leg towards it, bowed moſt profoundly, his eyes very modeſtly fixed on the ground during a few ſeconds. The lady with an air of complacency and dignity looking full in his face, and, placing both her hands on her waiſt before, gently threw back her left foot, and, in a manner, which I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deſcribe, ſeemed ſinking beneath the level of the floor; then riſing graceful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her natural height, ſhe tendered him one of her hands, which he gently received with one of his. He now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted her towards a door, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into another apartment. I at firſt imagined they were going to enter it; but both ſuddenly turning, he bowed, and ſhe ſunk and roſe again. The mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic now began, and the lady expanded the lower part of her apparel in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to me altogether new and aſtoniſhing. After a very ſhort ſpace, he bowed and
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:020481_0044_0FAF12A6EC86AA98"/>
ſunk again, then both turning half round, the bowing and ſinking was repeated. The gentleman with his right hand now took hold of the lady's left hand, (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently only one half of her garments remained expanded) and both of them, moving ſlowly and majeſtically, advanced towards the middle of the room, when, deſcribing nearly a ſemicircle, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated in oppoſite directions. The lady's left hand, being now at liberty, reſtored her garment to its full expanſion. They continued in motion about two or three minutes, approaching, croſſing and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, when the lady, extending and waving her right hand in a moſt bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manner, the gentleman alſo extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and waved his; and they advanced towards each other, till the tips of their fingers met. Then retreating and again advancing, their left hands performed the ſame graceful ceremony. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued approaching, croſſing and retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about two minutes longer, when the lady, with a languiſhing look, letting her garment drop into its natural poſition, extended both her arms, and advanced
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020481_0045_0FAF12A7C159D728"/>
to meet the gentleman, who with his arms alſo extended, approached her with more than uſual briſkneſs. After turning round, they repaired to the ſpot, where the ceremony began, from which, after three more ſinks and as many bows, the gentleman lead her to her ſeat; and after one more bow and a concluding ſink retired.</p>
               <p>This ſerious mummery concluded, I imagined the dancing girls, according to the Algerine faſhion, would be now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced; but, to my great aſtoniſhment, it was repeated by almoſt all the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. A pauſe of about ten minutes ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, when the ladies, having quitted their ſeats, began to adjuſt their dreſſes, which I could not perceive had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed; their fans were not neglected and their handkerchiefs were well em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed. After ſome conſultation, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with many bows and ſinks, the males and females formed two diſtinct rows, each male oppoſite to a female at about the diſtance of three feet. Hitherto their countenances had been ſettled and even
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:020481_0046_0FAF12A8807FAF80"/>
ſevere, their converſation carried on in whiſpers, and their demeanor more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of devotion than feſtivity; nay, I had been almoſt tempted to believe, that they had been engaged in performing ſome religious ceremonies, not unlike the rites of the ancient Corybantes, or the extatic evolutions of our holy derviſes. But how was I deceived!—One of the muſicians ſtamping with his foot by way of ſignal, the ſprightlieſt notes were heard. In an inſtant gravity was put to flight, and in my opinion, decorum ſuffered not a little. Smiling, capering and nodding enſued. A gentleman turned a lady round with one hand, then with the other; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times three turned round together, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times four, and, occaſionally, even ſix. The circle appeared to me their favourite figure; but, to prevent giddineſs as I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, they ſometimes practiſed the right line. One figure gave me much ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, after ſome obſervation, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be the arithmetical 8.</p>
               <p>Thus far they proceeded on mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical principles; but in the courſe of their
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:020481_0047_0FAF12A929B8B1D0"/>
fooleries, I thought I perceived a degree of myſtic morality. The lady at times fled from the gentleman, as if ſhe was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended; whilſt he, from the hope of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſing her anger, followed her with be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming tenderneſs; but deeming her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable, and conſcious of his own dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, gives over the purſuit and flies from her. She, juſtly apprehenſive of loſing him entirely, follows him in turn; a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation enſues, and their hands are reunited. It was altogether the moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting ſcene I had ever beheld, and I had every reaſon to be pleaſed, that no hired dancing girls had been introduced. The ladies and gentlemen, ſome few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertencies (which ought not to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned) and one or two ſlips, (attended with no bad conſequences) excepted, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their parts with grace and agility, and, as I was the ſole ſpectator, were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to my warmeſt applauſe.</p>
               <p>I have as yet received no letters from Algiers; but, ſhould any arrive at this place after my departure, they will be diſpatched to Liſbon by Solomon Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez.
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:020481_0048_0FAF12AA036FDE18"/>
An Engliſh veſſel, in which I have already engaged my paſſage, will ſail in a few days for that celebrated port. Thou wilt doubtleſs give me a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of all that has been done or is do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at court or in the city. If Fatima's grief has ſubſided, ſhe will inform me of my domeſtic concerns.

Her beauty at firſt inflamed my heart; her diſcretion, I am certain, will ſecure my eſteem.</p>

               <p>I AM induced to think that ſea-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs reſembles the ſmall-pox, with which we are never afflicted a ſecond time; but I ſpeak with becoming diffidence, not chuſing to build an hypotheſis on a ſingle fact.</p>
               <p>My voyage from Gibraltar to this beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful port was in every reſpect delightful. The winds were favourable and gentle, the ſea as ſmooth as I could have wiſhed, and the azure of the ſky ſeldom obſcured by a cloud. I found myſelf ſo much at eaſe, that I was almoſt conſtantly on the deck.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſs, thought I, if the ſea was never agitated by tempeſts, a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of mankind would prefer it for their abode; like the Chineſe and Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers who, with their families, reſide
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:020481_0050_0FAF12ACD3D57BF0"/>
on rivers in floating manſions. Several occupations might be followed as well on the ſea as the land. Raw materials, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the cultivator of the earth, might be manufactured by the inhabitants of the ocean. A tarif, regulating the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the terraqueous globe, might eaſily be eſtabliſhed; fiſh might be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered for fleſh and vegetables; and, ſince the ladies on both elements muſt have ornaments, pearls might be exchanged for diamonds; nor would the powers of the earth have any reaſonable excuſe for waging war, as long as any part of the ocean remained uncolonized. Archime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des aſſerted, that, if he had but a ſpot to ſtand upon, he would play at tennis with the ball which we inhabit; for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of my ſyſtem, I require but the annihilation of tempeſts. Nor ſhould the ſea-ſcurvy be mentioned as an objection by the medical faculty, till the plague is eradicated by their ſkill; the latter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order being at leaſt as deſtructive as the former.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="unknown:020481_0051_0FAF12ACF48D23E8"/>Before we paſſed the rock of Liſbon, I obſerved a particular archneſs in the looks of the ſailors, which gave me no uneaſineſs, as I was acquainted with the cauſe of it. My friend, Solomon Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez, had informed me of a cuſtom amongſt Engliſh mariners, of exacting a tribute from all on board on their firſt ſeeing this celebrated rock. I readily complied with an uſage which, like many others as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinaciouſly adhered to, has no foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in nature or reaſon. The wine was produced; the ſailors wiſhed me health with a ſurly benevolence, and we jovial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entered this noble port, which for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years was the centre of commerce between Europe and Aſia.</p>
               <p>Thou art not unacquainted with the exertion of maritime enterpriſe and mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary proweſs, which diſtinguiſhed this people in the fifteenth century. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy with which they conducted their plan of depoſing king Philip, their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in chuſing the duke of Braganza for their monarch, their conqueſts in Aſia, and their ſettlements in Africa and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:020481_0052_0FAF12ADF8911C10"/>
contributed to render them a rich and a glorious nation. They may even at preſent be conſidered as a people poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of a conſiderable ſhare of commerce; but their national valour is no longer the theme of panegyric.</p>
               <p>The mere hiſtorian is capable of giving us a regular detail of events. It belongs to the philoſopher alone to trace the riſe and fall of national character, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate thoſe cauſes, which exalt men to heroiſm, or ſink them in ſervitude. I confeſs myſelf unequal to the taſk; but ſhall only remark, that the revolution in Portugal was ſimply a change of maſters. Don Juan was certainly a brave and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Prince; but the royal authority, on the depoſition of Philip, was in no reſpect reſtrained or regulated. Thus their political happineſs depending on the characters of their ſucceeding princes, the Portugueze have ſhared the fate of other nations in ſimilar circumſtances; they have been wiſely governed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="unknown:020481_0053_0FAF12AFA4CAAF98"/>It has been my fate, ſince I left Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, to travel with Engliſhmen and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ with Jews. I am lodged at the houſe of Iſaac d'Acoſta, whoſe civility makes ample amends for his extreme bigotry. Methinks I hear thee exclaim, are not bigotry and civility incompatible? By no means; a wolf ſubdued by his keeper, is a harmleſs animal in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence; and this Jew, not entirely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from the dread of the inquiſition, is a tractable being.</p>
               <p>May the great inquiſition of reaſon be eſtabliſhed throughout the world! Thus ſhall our holy faith be eſtabliſhed in the hearts of the barbarous idolator, and the obſtinate Jew and Chriſtian!</p>

               <p>THE Hebrew religion being odious to the people and obnoxious to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, my hoſt is but little troubled with the company of the Portugueze. Nor is his diſpoſition or talents ſuited to liberal converſation. To me he is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant; to his family moroſe. How dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from Solomon Mendez, whoſe houſe was the abode of cheerfulneſs! I am impatient to begin my voyage, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that I ſhall find more ſociety on the Atlantic than in this populous city. But let me not be haſty or unjuſt. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps his reſerve is the reſult of conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or his affairs may be deranged; or his domeſtic felicity impaired. He has probably been rendered unhappy by a diſobedient child or a falſe friend. In ſhort, I am willing to aſſign any reaſon for his ſupercilious diſtance, rather than attribute it to a bad diſpoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:020481_0055_0FAF12B0AD8A9D78"/>Yeſterday after dinner I had ſome converſation with a Rabbi, who is in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance leſs arrogant, than his brother at Gibraltar, but more baſe and wicked. As a ſpecimen of his converſation, I ſhall relate a tale, which he told. "When God created Adam, ſaid the Rabbi, he formed him ſo high and large, that his head reached the heavens, and his ſides extended from the eaſt to the weſt. The angels, terrified at his appearance, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the protection of the Creator who, to rid them of their fears, put his hand on the head of Adam and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his ſize to one thouſand cubits; but, according to other Jewiſh doctors, to leſs. His firſt wife was called Lileth, who, being formed of as good earth as himſelf, diſdained to ſubmit to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and flying up into the air, refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to return to her huſband, although entreated by hoſts of angels." From this improbable fiction he inferred the extreme degeneracy of man, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent obſtinacy of woman. At the concluſion of this legend, equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable and abſurd, Iſaac nodded aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:020481_0056_0FAF12B16DEB2080"/>
but his family diſcovered evident marks of diſſatisfaction. I wanted no further proof of the baſeneſs of this ſanctified villain, who aimed at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratiating himſelf with his patron by deſtroying his peace of mind. The cauſe of his diſcontent was now evident. A domeſtic traitor imbittered his life, and eſtabliſhed in his boſom that worſt of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions, a diſtruſt of his own family.</p>
               <p>I ſhall certainly diſcloſe my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to d'Acoſta on this head before my departure; my conſcience otherwiſe will not be at reſt.</p>
               <p>As my ſtay will be ſhort, I ſhall not have it in my power to give thee an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate idea of this city, which I am told, is as well built, as it was before the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake. Portugal is not my object. Her weakneſs is too well known at Algiers to create apprehenſions. Ignorance, ſloth and barbariſm characteriſe her ſons, and her daughters are the victims of pride and ſuperſtition. Her ſtreets ſwarm with monks, and her convents
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:020481_0057_0FAF12B23A8F5928"/>
are crouded with nuns. Too eager in the purſuit of commerce, ſhe neglected agriculture and manufactures. Her gold, which enriches others, is droſs to her, and the precious ſtones of the Brazils can ſcarcely procure bread for her chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. Yet this country was not always contemptible. Her people were once induſtrious, and her prieſts were learned. She could boaſt a Camoens and a Gama, and was governed by an Emanuel and a Braganza; whoſe names are at this day leſs known in Portugal, than in any other part of Europe. Surely this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ordained to accumulate wealth to reward the induſtry of the Engliſh and the valour of the Algerines!</p>
               <p>A philoſophical hiſtory of commerce, would be an invaluable preſent to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. But if ever it ſhould appear, I will venture to predict, that its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples will be but little attended to. The ambition of princes and the avarice of merchants will never be reſtrained or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated by ſyſtems. The cuſtom-houſe books alone will be read by the former.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:020481_0058_0FAF12B32EA9D0E8"/>
If the imports have been productive, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further will be required. The merchant, in ſumming up his accounts, will be perfectly content, if there be a conſiberable balance in his favour; but experience evinces, that Britain has derived more ſolid wealth from the tin mines of Cornwall, than Spain from the ſilver mines of Mexico; and the nutmegs of Borneo, have been more beneficial to Holland, than the diamonds of Brazil to Portugal.</p>

               <p>THE ſhip, in which I have enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a paſſage, will ſail for the new world to-morrow. I ſhall ſoon behold a region, which has never been trod by an Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine. A mixture of hope and fear, of delight and terror, occupies my heart; but religion and patriotiſm ſupport me in the conflict. I conſider myſelf as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Empedocles. Anxious to explore the cauſes of thoſe convulſions, which agitate Aetna and lay waſte the fair fields of Sicily with liquid fire, he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed in the glorious attempt. My fate may be ſimilar; but my glory ſhall be greater. He died without accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his object; but if I arrive in the new ſtates, which have lately been the political Aetna of the world, I ſhall ſeize every opportunity of acquiring and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating information.</p>

                  <pb n="62" facs="unknown:020481_0060_0FAF12B4E5C70D10"/>A vaſt field lies before me. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive coaſt, abounding in harbours; an immenſe tract of country, divided into thirteen ſtates, but united, with reſpect to national exertion, under one head; a ſoil, capable of producing all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, and moſt of the luxuries of life, the greater part of which is ſtill covered with the nobleſt timber, and abounds in the moſt uſeful mines, the inexhauſtible materials of future navies; towns riſing into cities, and cities already aſpiring to be the emporiums of commerce; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants free, active and intelligent; their governments mild and enlightened; religion promoted by a benevolent tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and morality enforced by the brighteſt examples; theſe bleſſings have been founded throughout Europe, as eminently poſſeſſed by the new ſtates. The echo has reached Algiers and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted the attention of her vigilant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency.</p>
               <p>But as in all matters of conſequence, vague conjectures are indulged and haſty concluſions are drawn; as facts are often
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:020481_0061_0FAF12B5E98C8920"/>
exaggerated by fancy, or misrepreſented by intereſt; as truth has been too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently violated by enthuſiaſm, and phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy itſelf has been the dupe of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſis, it was thought neceſſary to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy a man of obſervation and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, who, by reſiding on the ſpot, might ſeparate the ſpecious from the ſolid, and, diveſted of prejudice, be directed ſolely by candour. After many conſultations, the eyes of our governors were fixed on me. My friends imputed to me the neceſſary qualifications, and my enemies in ſilence expreſſed their approbation. I accepted the office with affected joy; for had I heſitated but a moment, my courage and my patriotiſm would have been queſtioned; and the malice of my enemies would have been as effectually gratified by my diſgrace at home, as it can be by want of ſucceſs abroad. The former was inevitable; the latter is but probable.</p>

Mendez at Gibraltar, who will take care to forward them to Algiers. All letters diected to me from Algiers muſt alſo come through his hands.</p>
               <p>Having now arranged our mode of correſpondence, I muſt treſpaſs on your patience with reſpect to my private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. I received from the treaſury the day before I ſailed, two thouſand Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hanneſes for the purpoſe of defraying my expences, with aſſurance of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adequate to my trouble and riſque. A part of this ſum I have depoſited in the hands of Solomon Mendez; the remainder I take with me, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a ſum belonging to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>No man of prudence ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the diſpoſal of his affairs till the hour of ſickneſs.

property, (ſome few marks of my eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem excepted) is ſettled on my child. The younger part of my ſlaves I have emancipated; the reſt will not only have freedom, but competency; I owe no money, and all that I could claim from others, was either received or compounded before I failed; ſo that this executorſhip, if I ſhould die, will be attended with as little trouble as poſſible.</p>
               <p>Perhaps what I have juſt written will appear to thee to be the reſult of timidity. But wilt thou raſhly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that I want courage, becauſe I am prudent? Once for all, let me tell thee, that I go prepared to execute my commiſſion, with a mind as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruffled, as when under thy command I aſſiſted in repelling the enemies of our faith and country. I anticipate the honours, which our government ſhall bellow on me; I hear the ſhouts of applauding thouſands; I graſp the hand of congratulating friendſhip; I

               <p>I AM arrived. I tread on the weſtern continent. A native of Algiers is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the roof of a Pennſylvanian. Yet the genius of the ſtate ſeems uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of danger, and the unſuſpecting croud are as buſily employed in their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs or pleaſures, as if I was at home ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on my ſopha. So let them be. Releaſed from the fatigues and perils of war, let their young men indulge in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation, and their maidens in feſtivity; let their farmers reſume their long ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected ploughs, whilſt their merchants anticipate their ideal thouſands. I am pleaſed with their buſtle. The more they are occupied, the leſs notice will they take of me. The mind, which is eager in the purſuit of wealth or pleaſure ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſtops ſhort to indulge curioſity. The cloud, which prevented the Carthagini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from perceiving Aeneas and Achates,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:020481_0066_0FAF12B8E7B4E2F0"/>
thoſe illuſtrious ſpies, was undoubtedly the hurry of buſineſs.</p>
               <p>I have delivered my letters of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to the gentlemen to whom they are addreſſed. Theſe letters deſcribe me as a French gentleman, who wiſhes to ſee the country before he engages in either commerce or agriculture. Some hints are given of a domeſtic misfortune, which has rendered his own country diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him. I decline dining abroad, but in the afternoon occaſionally viſit a few families. As it is known that I came laſt from Liſbon, no French letters could be expected from me. I am yet at an inn, which is crouded with foreigners, but ſhall remove ſhortly to lodgings in a private family, which admits but one ſtranger. The few Frenchmen whom I have ſeen, finding me diſtant, are deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be equally ſo. Their pride in this particular is far from being diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me.</p>
               <p>A part of my money is depoſited in a bank, which in its principles reſembles
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:020481_0067_0FAF12BA9C45ABC0"/>
many of the European banks; but as I am not thoroughly acquainted with its plan, I ſhall not entruſt it with all my ſtock.</p>
               <p>You cannot as yet expect any thing particular from me. In general I am pleaſed with the appearance of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Their deportment is gentle and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſuming, and my ears have not as yet been offended with many oaths.</p>
               <p>I obſerve a particular claſs of men, their hair looſe and unpowdered, their hats uncocked, their linen without ruffles, and their coats, which are generally light coloured, with mohair buttons. Can theſe be the officers and ſoldiers of the late ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, who, having parted with their mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary dreſs, ſtill affect an uniformity in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parel? I am convinced I am right; and I think I perceive in them a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing look and an air of dignity, which are more readily acquired in camps than cities.</p>
               <p>I was called to this employment ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, that I had not time to read many
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:020481_0068_0FAF12BB9DFA9B38"/>
books written on American ſubjects. The Britiſh colonies on this continent were as little known to the Algerines be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the laſt war, as the moſt remote parts of Europe and Aſia. We had often heard of Peru and Mexico through the medium of Spain; but a Pennſylvanian was leſs known to us, than a Greenlander or a Chineſe. They ſhall however have no reaſon in future to complain of our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect. Due attention ſhall be paid by us to their national enſigns on the ocean; nor ſhall their government or reſources continue unnoticed. They have invited all the mercantile world to their ports. Our countrymen, more modeſt than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhall viſit only their coaſts. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral nations have complimented them with ſplendid embaſſies. Averſe to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence and oſtentation I live among them without ceremony, and ſhall not flatter their pride or excite their avarice by promiſes of commercial treaties never intended to be performed. If my em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment was known, it is probable that I ſhould be condemned to die by their tribunals, unleſs torn in pieces by the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulace.

How ungrateful, how ungene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous would ſuch conduct be, ſince it can be proved, that the councils of nations, as well as the behaviour of individuals, may be benefited by a conſciouſneſs of their being narrowly watched!</p>
               <p>I ſpend a part of the day in walking through the city, partly to preſerve my health, and partly to imitate the air and manners of the people. My head is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reconciled to my hat, and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep, which at firſt was ſorely oppreſſed, cheerfully ſubmits to the tyranny of the buckle. My body, which was at firſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered almoſt incapable of action by my Liſbon taylor, performs its evolutions, according to the diſcipline of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, with eaſe and agility, and at my meals I handle my arms with ſufficient dexterity. How dull muſt the Ruſſians have been, who ſpent a century in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining accompliſhments, which I have acquired in a few weeks. But as vanity is dangerous and offenſive, I ſuppreſs its emotions.</p>

               <p>THESE Philadelphians ſeem to me as well calculated to excel in commerce as to triumph in war. Their river is crouded with ſhipping, and their ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes and ſhops with merchandiſe. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt every man I meet is or ſeems to be a merchant. I am frequently joſtled in the ſtreet; but how can I be offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſince I as frequently joſtle others. Even the pride of a Caſtilian (if a Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilian could condeſcend to mix with tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) would not be offended at their well meaning buſtle. But as I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſell, and want to buy but a few trifling articles, I ſhall not expoſe myſelf a ſecond time to the riſque of ſuffocation in a place, which they call the City Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſe.</p>
               <p>It is ſurpriſing to ſee the immenſe quantities of rich manufactures imported
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:020481_0072_0FAF12BF018FDB48"/>
into a country, which, as I am informed, has no ſilver mines or any other rare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of nature. Theſe importations, I am led to think, can only injure the country by introducing a premature lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ury with its concomitant evils.</p>
               <p>In moſt nations there are three ſorts of tyranny; the firſt civil; the ſecond ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical; the third I ſhall call the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of <hi>faſhion.</hi> The firſt is well known at Algiers; the ſecond has been heard of; but the third is altogether unknown. The Pennſylvanians have known but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the firſt, and nothing of the ſecond; but the greater part of them is grievouſly oppreſſed by the laſt.</p>
               <p>The origin of <hi>faſhion</hi> is perhaps co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eval with the creation of man; but the more enlightened are of opinion, that, immediately after the fall, ſhe ſprang from the head of Eve, as Minerva is ſaid to have iſſued from the brain of Jupiter. At firſt ſimple and artleſs, ſhe indulged herſelf in innocent levities. She form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a head-dreſs of flowers for Eve, and
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:020481_0073_0FAF12BFA968C0F8"/>
another of green leaves for Adam. But the father of mankind, with becoming dignity, rejected the preſent, till, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by Eve, he conſented to wear it to ſcreen him, as he ſaid, from the too powerful rays of the ſun. After this ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs the influence of faſhion extended to their ſons and daughters. Her inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grew more lively and her exertions more varied. In theſe days, it is record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhe was attended by ſimplicity, a nymph whoſe cheeks vied in freſhneſs with the bluſhes of the morn, and whoſe limbs, frequently exerciſed in the chaſe, excelled in ſymmetry and ſtrength. Guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſimplicity the reign of faſhion was gentle and delightful. The maidens, obeying her dictates, were lovely and tender; and the young men, who were then under the dominion of <hi>reaſon,</hi> were ſincere and affectionate. The fragrant fields, the delicious fruits and the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ſtreams, conſtituted the luxuries of man, whilſt the harmony of the ſoul was improved by the muſic of the groves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="unknown:020481_0074_0FAF12C06C545F98"/>But as happineſs, ſince the great tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, has been inconſtant and fleet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a gradual degeneracy took place. The young men became thoughtleſs, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and diſſipated. Rejecting reaſon and diſdaining the guidance of ſimplicity, many of them were ſeduced by the ſyren voluptuouſneſs; others purſued the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom falſe glory, and not a few were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated by the daemon avarice. The maidens finding the young men growing inattentive to their charms, and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined at all events on exciting admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, were, with much reluctance, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to diſmiſs ſimplicity and call in art to the aſſiſtance of faſhion. By this alliance faſhion was at firſt ſtrengthened; but afterwards weakened. The maidens, it is true, triumphed in the conteſt, but ſoon abuſed their victory. Many of them, by the advice of art, formed a league with levity and caprice, and ſome of them have gone ſo far as to ſet huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity at defiance, and are cloſely allied to deceit and cruelty. It is difficult to ſay, how this unnatural warfare will end;
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:020481_0075_0FAF12C1B4CD5968"/>
but it is very probable, that, unleſs mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are ſpeedily compromiſed by fair conceſſions, the young men will have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to inſenſibility and neglect, and the young women will yield to peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and deſpair.</p>

taken to render the ſtudents as uſeleſs as poſſible to themſelves, their families and their countries. What benefits can be derived from ſocieties, where, after much miſ-ſpent application and an irreparable loſs of time, a young man is imperfectly inſtructed in two or three unneceſſary languages; where reaſon is fettered by logical rules, and religion involved in metaphyſical ſubtilties, and where the mind, too often diſguſted by unſuitable ſtudies, loſes all reliſh for either elegant literature or uſeful ſcience. Boys, even in their infancy, are too often deſigned for a particular profeſſion by their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or friends. This is evidently ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, in as much as neither their talents or inclinations can be conſulted at ſo early a period. But the abſurdity is enhanced, when the youth, deſtined to the mercantile profeſſion, muſt purſue thoſe ſtudies, which as he advances in life, he will find altogether uſeleſs and and ſcarcely ornamental, and which are only calculated to render the lawyer a wrangling ſophiſt, and the divine an art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful polemic.

               <p>THE legiſlative authority of this ſtate is lodged in a ſingle houſe, elected by the people, and is called the Aſſembly. The executive power, elected alſo by the people, is lodged in a Council. The preſident of the council is appointed by the joint ballot of the aſſembly and council. The judicial authority is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from both. Every ſeventh year a Council of Cenſors is elected by the people, who are authoriſed to point out all violations of the conſtitution, and in ſhort all ſtate miſconduct. This coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil has alſo the right of calling a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, who are empowered to explain and amend the conſtitution.

<pb n="82" facs="unknown:020481_0080_0FAF12C6938BB920"/>
cenſured by ſome political writers. Their grand objection appears to be, that as the legiſlative authority is lodged in a ſingle houſe, there can be no ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance. Even if this be granted, to what will it amount? As the houſe can never be unanimous in any ſerious attempt on the rights of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, the minority will always operate as a check, till the people are alarmed. I am greatly miſtaken, if this check will not be adequate to the danger; if not, what can be ſaid, but that the people have been weighed in a balance, and found altogether light and unworthy of political freedom. In ſhort, no form of republican government can long oppreſs a brave and enlightened people. If their conſtitution is experimentally found to be good, they will maintain it; but the beſt will prove defective, if they are ignorant of their rights, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive to the preſervation of them.</p>
               <p>Men of lively imaginations are fond of ſimiles. The conſtitution of Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, ſays one, is like a loaded waggon—
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:020481_0081_0FAF12C72FB7B6A8"/>

                  <p>The conſtitution of Pennſylvania may be compared to a piece of beef transfix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſpit, and placed horizontally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a rouſing fire.

But ſhould a ſpeculative cook introduce a ſecond jack, which ſhould attempt to govern the other end of the ſpit, who can affirm, that this innovation would be productive of any ſolid advantage? On the contrary, would not this ſecond jack be at once an expenſive and uſeleſs article, not to mention Betty's extraordinary trouble in winding up two jacks, and her miſtreſs's loſs of temper in finding the dinner every day either too much or too little done.</p>

               <p>TWO of thy letters are now before me. Why wilt thou tear my heart with thy tender complaints? Art thou not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preſent to me? Thrice every day I addreſs myſelf to Allah to comfort thee in my abſence.</p>
               <p>Even this abſence, which thou calleſt cruel and intolerable, ought to endear me to thee. To render myſelf worthy of thy charms, thy tenderneſs, and thy vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, I defied the terrors of the raging ocean, and have ventured to breathe the ſame air with profane chriſtians. But my rewards, though ſlow, will more than compenſate my toils and dangers. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers will acknowledge my ſervices, and Fatima will again bleſs me with her love.</p>
               <p>Our child, thou ſayeſt, is ſickly. Thy maternal care may be exceſſive. Fatima,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:020481_0086_0FAF12CAF52967D0"/>
remember, that thy child, however dear, has no right to rob me of thy health.</p>
               <p>In Pennſylvania enthuſiaſm is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found; but the influence of ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is trifling. I have lately heard the rhapſody of a female preacher. I figure to myſelf thy extreme ſurpriſe on this occaſion. Yes, Fatima, a female preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in a garb, long, white and flowing, her head uncovered, her hair in natural ringlets, her countenance by turns ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of pity and anger, of joy and terror, proclaimed to an attentive audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the coming of Chriſt. Yet ſhe is not ſuppoſed to be mad. Although wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are forbidden by one of the firſt Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarene teachers to ſpeak in their church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or to appear in them with their heads uncovered, yet this woman, in violation of both theſe precepts, dared to appear in the manner I have deſcribed. She was not only liſtened to attentively, but even excited tears. Fatima, this woman, thus apparelled, or, to ſpeak more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, almoſt unapparelled, preached to
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:020481_0087_0FAF12CBB1906290"/>
a crouded congregation in a civilized country.</p>
               <p>What ſhall I tell thee of a city, where women appear barefaced in the ſtreets, and, what is ſtill more extraordinary, the men behold them with inſenſibility. I ſaw this very morning a man in decent apparel accoſt a well-dreſſed woman; graſping her ready hand, he led her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs the ſtreet, and ſhe thanked him with a ſmile, to which no man but her huſband could be entitled. Even in the churches they gaze on the men with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted eyes, nor have I, ſince my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, ſeen a bluſh on a female cheek, a child about ten years old excepted, who walking careleſsly, had been in danger of falling. When the cheek ceaſes to bluſh, the heart, I conclude, is grown callous to ſhame. Yet are they lovely in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme. Nature has profuſely adorned them with charms, but a bad education diminiſhes the luſtre of their beauties. They often ſpeak before they are ſpoken to; they ſmile in the preſence of men, and a giddy girl, the other day, not more
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:020481_0088_0FAF12CC88281AB0"/>
than ſixteen, at the tea-table, the room full of company and in the ſight and hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her venerable parents, laughed immoderately at the diſtreſs of a young gentleman who had ſcalded his lips in ſip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping his tea ſomewhat haſtily. She threw herſelf backward in her chair, then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and continued agitated by convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive laughter more than two minutes, her cheeks glowing, her eyes darting fire, and her boſom riſing and falling during this paroxiſm of outrageous mirth. At length riſing haſtily and tripping light as a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymph, ſhe darted out of the room, and retired up ſtairs. After a ſhort abſence ſhe returned to the company with a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, as compoſed, as if ſhe had been guilty of no indiſcretion.</p>
               <p>If this young woman were bleſt with thy converſation, how would thy precepts and example at once enlighten her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding and improve her conduct! She would learn from thee, that not even the beauty of a Houri can atone for the levity of laughter.</p>

               <p>THE attention paid to the body of a deceaſed friend in this city is decent and amiable; but the manner to a ſtranger muſt appear particular and ludicrous.</p>
               <p>A man is employed to announce the death of a citizen. For this purpoſe he raps at all the doors, and in a loud and ſolemn tone of voice invites the family to the funeral. I went yeſterday to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe a pair of gloves at a ſhop, the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs of which is pregnant. Whilſt I was buſied in trying them on, a trumpet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of death, thruſting his funereal face into the ſhop, pronounced the doleful invitation in ſhrill and tremulous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents. The woman turned pale and had ſcarcely ſtrength to call for a glaſs of water. Mentioning this affair in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I was told, with an air of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:020481_0090_0FAF12CEA8D22E18"/>
that the woman muſt have had weak nerves and was probably a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
               <p>In one of my late walks, I perceived a number of theſe men, whom in a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer letter I conjectured to be the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the late army, entering the door of a large building. Finding that they were followed by ſeveral not dreſſed in uniforms, I took the liberty of entering with them. I perceived a great number of them ſeated on benches, placed at equal diſtances with great exactneſs. I ſate down amongſt them, prepared, if queſtioned, to have told them, with the greateſt politeneſs, that I was a French gentleman on my travels, and would be extremely happy in being honoured with their acquaintance; but not one of them took the leaſt notice of me or of each other. Their ladies, who ſeemed alſo to wear uniforms, were ſeated ſeparate from the men. An awful ſilence pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, which I had hitherto imagined was not numbered amongſt chriſtian virtues, eſpecially when ladies are preſent. At
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:020481_0091_0FAF12CFF9E768F8"/>
length, the men began occaſionally to groan, and the women to ſigh. An air of ſerious ſorrow was diffuſed over all their faces, which (with ſhame I confeſs it) affected me with horror. Not a word was uttered; but the ſighs and groans were repeated with ſcarce any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termiſſion. Surely, thought I, this is a ſcene of inchantment. For what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe are theſe people aſſembled? mirth cannot be their object; for they are all ſerious, and ſome even ſorrowful; nor can mercantile buſineſs be tranſacted in ſuch profound ſilence. Have they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted exceſſes during the war, which they publicly meet to expiate? This cannot be the caſe; for their humanity was as conſpicuous as their valour; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, with what cruelties can their wives and daughters be charged, who ſeem equally ſorrowful and penitent? A thought now prevailed in my mind, which I am aſhamed to confeſs even to thee. I ſuſpected, that I was ſeated amongſt ſome of thoſe benevolent Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nii, whoſe marvellous exploits are the
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:020481_0092_0FAF12D04C8692D0"/>
ſubjects of our romances. Impreſſed with this idea, and determined on being convinced, I trod, as if by accident on the toes of my next neighbour. The young man withdrew his foot ſomewhat haſtily and looked as if he felt pain; but continued as ſilent as before. He is compoſed of fleſh and blood, thought I with much ſatisfaction, and doubtleſs their females, many of whom were pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, are equally ſo.</p>
               <p>At length I concluded, that they were aſſembled to ſee and hear one of thoſe exhibitions (I think they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led tragedies) with which the Nazarenes are extremely delighted, becauſe they make them weep; but that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers had diſappointed them.</p>
               <p>The whole aſſembly, as if a ſignal had been given, roſe at once from their ſeats, and quitted the houſe; and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to my lodgings, ruminating on the ſtrangeſt ſcene I had ever beheld.</p>

               <p>THE object of my voyage to this continent, was to inform our illuſtrious regency of the actual ſtrength of theſe ſtates, and their future probable exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; of the manners and purſuits of the inhabitants; their commerce, manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures and agriculture; their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and laws.</p>
               <p>Confident that the ſubſtance of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters will be more attended to than their ſtyle, and that little method can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from a man, who commits to paper partial and incoherent information collected each day; I continue with cheerfulneſs to execute my commiſſion, not doubting, that due allowance will be made by my illuſtrious maſters for the weakneſs and incapacity of their ſlave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="unknown:020481_0094_0FAF12D366666608"/>The ſtrength of theſe ſtates does not conſiſt in numerous and diſciplined ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, or well appointed fleets. When his country demands his ſervice, every citizen is a ſoldier. The army, which repelled the Britiſh forces, it is true, exiſts no more, except a few companies ſufficient to check the inroads of the Indians; but their militia in the midſt of peace is preſerved in decent diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. The people being free and their enemies remote, there is no occaſion for a ſtanding army.</p>
               <p>The laſt war, has convinced theſe ſtates of two ſerious truths; they are too ſtrong to be conquered, and too weak to think of conquering others.</p>
               <p>Although an Algerine, devoted to the ſervice of my country, you, muſt permit me at times to be the philoſopher—at leaſt in words. There can be no excuſe for one nation making war on another, but the want of ſuſtenance. This peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple if but moderately induſtrious, will not for ages make uſe of this plea.
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:020481_0095_0FAF12D46C05DDF0"/>
Their ſoil is productive and their cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate not unfavourable; nor is their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation by any means proportioned to their extent of territory.</p>
               <p>Their governments are cenſured by ſeveral amongſt themſelves. Theſe cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures are the ſtrongeſt proofs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence of their governments, ſince no man is puniſhed for his cenſures. Were an Algerine ſuppoſed to have imagined only in a dream what a Pennſylvanian ſpeaks, prints, publiſhes, maintains and glories in, he would ſuffer the ſevereſt tortures.</p>
               <p>The manners and behaviour of the people correſpond with their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. No man creates or feels terror. The national countenance is therefore mild, and the national deportment man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There are undoubtedly ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy citizens; but the nobleſt ſoil often nouriſhes the moſt venemous ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:020481_0096_0FAF12D6113F96A0"/>Of their private virtues I can only ſay, that benevolence muſt prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a people, who build hoſpitals and never enquire about a man's religion.</p>
               <p>The Pennſylvanians, ſaid an exiled foreigner to me, are inhoſpitable.</p>
               <p>They have given thee a country, ſaid I.</p>
               <p>They want the graces, ſaid a fop.</p>
               <p>But they are modeſt, ſaid I, and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of improvement.</p>
               <p>They do not, ſaid a dancing maſter, ſufficiently encourage merit.</p>
               <p>A worthy blackſmith, whiſpered I, with whom I have ſome acquaintance, will give thee employment.</p>
               <p>Their women are diſtant and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſaid a coxcomb.</p>
               <p>They are fully appriſed of thy merit, ſaid I.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="unknown:020481_0097_0FAF12D62B0B39E0"/>Yet it muſt be confeſſed, that the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding part of the community is diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. By exceſſive importations the manufactures have been greatly injured, and the merchant begins to think, that commerce on a ſmall ſcale would have been more advantageous, than the wild plan, which has been purſued. As ſoon as the war was over, the American re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics ſeemed to have inconſiderately adopted the commercial plan of Holland. That commonwealth, ſuperabounding in men, wiſely encouraged commerce. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated in the centre of Europe, her ſhips ſupplied one nation with the produce and manufactures of another. She even eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed colonies in Aſia and America. Her councils at home were wiſe and ſteady, and her triumphs abroad were at once brilliant and ſolid. Her heros pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected her merchants, and her merchants honoured and rewarded her heros.</p>
               <p>The American ſtates are in a very different ſituation. The number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants bears no proportion to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:020481_0098_0FAF12D708BC9E38"/>
of their country. The arts are ſtill in their nonage, and many of them in their cradles. Why therefore did her ſtateſmen borrow maxims from rich and triumphant Holland, when Switzerland, laborious and frugal, could have furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them with better.</p>
               <p>May I venture to ſay, that there is a taſte in government as well as the polite arts. Inattentive to the want of propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ſymmetry, we are too often captivated by the brilliancy of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours.</p>

               <p>I HAVE given thee a haſty ſketch of the conſtitution of Pennſylvania, and intend ſhortly to acquaint thee with the ſyſtem, which conſtitutes her a member of a confederation, conſiſting of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſtates repreſented by a Congreſs.</p>
               <p>The conſtitution of this congreſs, which aſſiſted by patriotiſm, was found adequate to the exigences of war, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered to be defective in peace; like a ſhip, which having reſiſted the fury of the ſtorm, is endangered by the hollow ſwell during a calm.</p>
               <p>A Convention conſiſting of members from all the ſtates, is expected to meet in this city for the purpoſe of reviſing the confederation. It is expected, that their reſolves will ſilence all diſputes by
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:020481_0100_0FAF12D8725BD498"/>
remedying every grievance. For my part I doubt the ſucceſs of their delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, although ſanctioned by the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and enlightened by the wiſdom of their late commander in chief.</p>
               <p>General Waſhington, who has done as much as any hero, and a great deal more than moſt, who have been flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that title, reſides, as a private gentleman, on his eſtate in Virginia. Thoſe who are honoured with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, are delighted with his affability, vivacity and ſolid ſenſe. In the field he has manifeſted the qualities of the general and the hero; at his abode he diſplays the accompliſhments of the gentleman, and the virtues of the huſband and friend. But the moſt arduous taſk remains; the talents of the legiſlator are now expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him.</p>
               <p>During the heat of the war the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation was formed by the nobleſt efforts of patriotiſm and wiſdom. But patriotiſm was ſometimes more active
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:020481_0101_0FAF12D9367740A8"/>
than judicious; and wiſdom often ſaw defects, which ſhe could not remedy.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of Rhode Iſland, the leaſt conſiderable in the union, has hitherto defeated the beſt commercial plans. She has refuſed to ſend members to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and by this conduct will defeat unanimity, and countenance defection and revolt.</p>
               <p>The ſtate of Maſſachuſett's Bay is now convulſed by the deſperation of factious individuals; but the wiſer part of the community happens to conſtitute a majority. Some blood however has been ſhed, and more is apprehended. In Maſſachuſett's Bay, an ignorant mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, headed by Shays, have attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—they know not what; but in Rhode-Iſland the oppoſition to foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral meaſures is conducted by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, the members of which are guided by their private intereſt which they perfectly underſtand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="unknown:020481_0102_0FAF12DA07888EF0"/>As intereſt is generally a more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing rule of action than juſtice or patriotiſm, it is highly probable that Rhode-Iſland will perſevere in her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; and compulſive meaſures, ſhould they be adopted by the other ſtates, will but excite reſentment and provoke reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>Ever attentive to the welfare and glory of my country, I have revolved in my mind the means of rendering this very probable revolt beneficial to Algiers, and glorious to the Sublime Porte, by eſtabliſhing an Ottoman Malta on the coaſts of America. An European Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neval was received, honoured and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the miniſters of the Porte. Is not an American Shays entitled to equal rewards, if capable of rendering equal ſervices? Should this idea merit your approbation, I will immediately (but with due caution) commence a negociation with Shays, the Maſſachuſetts inſurgents, and the refractory leaders of the revolt in Rhode-Iſland. They will without doubt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a large ſum of money, in which, I think,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:020481_0103_0FAF12DB5805B820"/>
they ought to be gratified.

               <p>THE republican form of government is extremely flattering to the pride of man. Orators, poets and philoſophers, have ſounded its praiſes, whilſt the civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized part of the world has liſtened with rapture. Who is not ſoothed by the ſplendid dreams of Plato and Rouſſeau? Who is not rouſed by the thunder of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes and Cicero?</p>
               <p>But in all matters, which involve the welfare of nations, fancy ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained and judgment alone conſulted.</p>
               <p>In every form of government the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are undeniably the ſource of authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The throne of the greateſt deſpot, as well as the tribunal of the humbleſt magiſtrate, is founded on the conſent of the governed. I may be told, that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:020481_0106_0FAF12DD1482ABE0"/>
is generally eſtabliſhed and always maintained by <hi>force.</hi> But can the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal force of one man controul and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due a nation? Alas! the depravity of thouſands muſt co-operate with the ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their leader, and the power of the ſupreme tyrant is ſupported by inferior tyrants for the gratification of their own paſſions.</p>
               <p>I have often lamented the ſituation of our Deys. No ſooner is one murdered, than another is elected by the murderers of his predeceſſor. Should he dare to decline this honour, his refuſal is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by inſtant death. To preſerve his own life, he is obliged to act the tyrant, and reluctantly conſents to murders, which the brutal ſoldiers demand and execute with rapture. The authority of the Dey is founded on the ſoldiery—and ſurely the ſoldiers are men.</p>
               <p>Has not Conſtantinople herſelf often beheld an emperor triumphant in the morning and a headleſs trunk at night, whilſt his trembling ſucceſſor is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:020481_0107_0FAF12DF09EBA470"/>
by the janizaries to accept the ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of authority, as a ſanction for their rapine and cruelty? Let no man call him a monarch, who is every hour expoſed to the ſabre of a popular janizary. The ſhrine of the ſaint may be gazed on; but the offerings are the property of the prieſts. But I may be told, that theſe are the exceſſes of a ferocious ſoldiery.— Are not theſe ſoldiers men?</p>
               <p>Let us now viſit Ruſſia, the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive monarchy in Europe. A woman, without any natural right, has been raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the throne of that country by the ſoldiery, who by this ſingle act govern the monarchy and the monarch. She takes care to ſupply them with pay and plunder, and they continue to reſpect the work of their own hands. Here one part of the people (all could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the election) choſe a ſovereign for the whole, and for faſhion ſake are content to be called ſubjects. Therefore the authority of this autocratix is derived from the people.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="unknown:020481_0108_0FAF12E05C875840"/>The French monarchy ſhews great attention to the nobility and ſoldiery; and for very good reaſons. The ſoldiery and nobility ſupport the crown; and are not nobles and ſoldiers men? If not, what are they?</p>
               <p>The laſt monarchy I ſhall mention is Sweden. The illuſtrious monarch of this country, the worthy nephew of the immortal Frederick (and he too derived his authority from the people, who were conſtantly repreſented by two or three hundred thouſand delegates, elected with great caution and fully inſtructed in the principles of government) this king of the Goths<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſay, reſenting that one part of his people ſhould be oppreſſed by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, formed a wiſe reſolution, that there ſhould be no longer any complaints on that head. Aſſembling therefore both parties, he by the advice of proper coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, choſen from the body of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, brought the contending parties to reaſon. The rights of both nobles and people were placed in his hands, and he ſeems determined to keep them as pled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:020481_0109_0FAF12E1B8998468"/>
of their affection. Surely all muſt confeſs that his authority alſo is derived from the people.</p>
               <p>It can be proved, I think, (without citing any more examples) that all human authority and power are derived from the the people; becauſe, I apprehend, that, if there was no people, there could be no human authority or power.</p>
               <p>What minion of deſpotiſm, after ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly peruſing theſe arguments and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, will deny, that authority pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the people? Or what enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic demagogue, who is capable of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, will inſiſt, that dominion not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeds from, but is inherent in, the people? The firſt ought to reflect, that there can be no ſtream without a ſource; and the ſecond muſt be convinced by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, that rivers invariably ſeek the ocean. There is occaſionally a partial reflux of power, but it never reaches the fountain head.</p>

               <p>I AM pleaſed that thou haſt received in good condition the map of theſe ſtates. It will ſhew thee at one view the amazing extent of the country. The rivers are numerous and deep; the harbours capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and ſecure; the cultivated land is generally extremely productive, and the ſoil, which is ſtill covered by foreſts, planted by the hand of nature, promiſes equal fertility.</p>
               <p>Their conſtitutions, formed by a great majority of the people, inculcate as much liberty as men in ſociety can enjoy. New laws, when neceſſary, are made by dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates freely choſen, and adminiſtered by officers, who glory in being deemed the ſervants of the public. The people, tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and laborious, ſeem only to want encouragement, which may excite emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and ſyſtems, which may direct
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:020481_0111_0FAF12E3CC2A22C0"/>
their exertions. The phantom of foreign commerce, no longer purſued with inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate avidity, muſt ſoon yield to the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid efforts of domeſtic induſtry, guided by the wiſdom of the philoſopher and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot. If this encouragement is given and theſe ſyſtems eſtabliſhed, the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can republics will no longer be tributary to European induſtry, and the ſpeculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Algerine ſtateſmen will be found altogether ideal and illuſive.</p>
               <p>I expect with impatience permiſſion from the regency to return, which I beg you will ſolicit with all the ardour of friendſhip. My domeſtic concerns may require my immediate preſence, and claim all my attention, eſpecially as in this ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I can render no eſſential ſervice to my country. What refinements of policy can be apprehended from popular aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, who are more ſtudious to increaſe the happineſs of the people than to create enemies? Their ambition ought not to be dreaded by foreign powers; nor ſhould their factions invite foes, ſince, on the firſt appearance of hoſtilities, they
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:020481_0112_0FAF12E48BFE2508"/>
would undoubtedly unite in repelling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion. Even the unworthy conduct of Rhode-Iſland will not ſtimulate the other ſtates to oppreſs or deſert an unenlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened or unprincipled ſiſter; nor could the Porte derive any advantage from the poſſeſſion of that iſland. Its wealth would not pay, nor its territory feed, a ſufficient garriſon; nor would the annoyance of the trade of all the other ſtates (according to the preſent ſituation of commerce) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray the expences of twenty Algerine rovers. In ſhort, the American ſtates, rich in the productions of nature, are poor with reſpect to the improvements of art. They are too ſtrong to be conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and too weak to attempt conqueſt.</p>
               <p>I have lately heard of a ſociety in this country, called Free-maſons, who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for inviolable ſecrecy. Rather than diſcloſe a ſecret, they would endure extreme torture and ſubmit to be torn in pieces. What admirable ſpies would theſe men make, if employed by their country at foreign courts! But perhaps their eſtabliſhed reputation would render
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:020481_0113_0FAF12E53528FE58"/>
their exertions ineffectual, juſt as a very ſkilful gameſter, when his talents are known, finds no body willing to play with him except for trifles. I too am poſſeſſed of a ſecret, but am by no means deſirous of appearing to poſſeſs it. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition is beſt concealed by a ſhow of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular humility, and ſecrecy rendered ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure by apparent frankneſs.</p>

As I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no obligation to Mehemet, no apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for my conduct is due to him. His behaviour to me, I confeſs (due allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance being made for education and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample) was humane and liberal. The money therefore, which he gave as the price of my freedom, ſhall be reſtored to him ſpeedily and with intereſt.

               <p>Let it not be ſaid, that I made uſe of unjuſtifiable methods in gaining her heart. As long as their child was living, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered her as united to Mehemet by that tie. I pitied her ſituation and eſteemed her for her gentleneſs and diſcretion. But on the death of the child, pity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced affection and eſteem ripened into love. My eyes and behaviour at firſt teſtified my ſentiments. She ſaw, and did not diſapprove. At length I ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcloſe my paſſion. She liſtened, and conſented. A virtuous affection re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved her natural timidity. Our love
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:020481_0123_0FAF12F0E78F1EF8"/>
was mutual and ardent; the coaſt of Spain not diſtant. We ventured and ſucceeded; but by what methods muſt remain a ſecret. Convinced by my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments, ſhe is now a chriſtian and my wife. The liberality of ſome merchants ſupplied us with decent clothing, and their patronage will afford me the means of ſupporting a family by induſtry.</p>
               <p>When you write to Mehemet, you may acquaint him that I retain a due ſenſe of his mildneſs and forbearance. Not to be ſevere is meritorious, in a country where ſlavery is eſtabliſhed. I am no longer his ſlave, and am therefore capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his friend.

               <p>Inſult not my underſtanding by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing the name of generoſity on this conduct. If I can be juſt to this ill treated pair, my mind will be at eaſe, nor can I in this inſtance, lay claim, to the merit of philoſophy. At ſixty the tumult of the paſſions ought to ſubſide, without any aſſiſtance from philoſophic reſignation.</p>
               <p>Yet I muſt confeſs, that, on the receipt of thy laſt letter, I was greatly ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A fever enſued, attended with a delirium. My extreme temperance alone

preſerved my life. At length the fever abated; I am reſtored to health and peace, and am even aſtoniſhed, that my mind ſhould have been ſo long the ſeat of unworthy paſſions. Was my love the reſult of reaſon? by no means; I have therefore diſcarded it. Was my ambition founded on juſtice? Alas! treachery and virtue are incompatible. How am I afflicted, when I recollect, that, in all poſſible caſes, the laws of the country, which I meant to betray, would have protected me from inſult and injury. An open enemy may chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge eſteem; a ſpy is a mean and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable character. I have written to Solyman at Algiers, concerning a ſum of money belonging to me, which is in his poſſeſſion. He will remit that ſum to thee on my account, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in thy hands, till the arrival of Maria and her huſband in Philadelphia. When my family (they are all that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemet can now lay claim to) ſhall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, I ſhall cloſe my affairs in Africa and Europe, and eſtabliſh my future tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity

on the pillars of freedom, juſtice, friendſhip and religion.</p>
               <p>Algiers! thou, who haſt often beheld me, animated by glory, or incited by ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, preparing to encounter the raging tempeſt and the furious battle; who haſt often welcomed thy returning ſon, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with trophies and loaded with ſpoils; who haſt often ſeen him encouraging the ardour of youth and ſoothing the woes of age; honoured for his valour, and ſcarcely envied for his magnificence. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers, thou witneſs of my glory and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, farewel! And thou Pennſylvania, who haſt promiſed to ſuccour and protect the unhappy, that fly to thee for refuge, open thy arms to receive Mehemet the Algerine, who, formerly a mahometan, and thy foe, has renounced his enmity, his country and his religion, and hopes, protected by thy laws, to enjoy, in the evening of his days, the united bleſſings of FREEDOM and CHRISTIANITY.</p>
