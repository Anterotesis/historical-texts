            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>It is <hi>Davids</hi> observation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>There is in every Command something that is expresly declared, and a great many more things that are necessarily included. This Rule is applicable to the <hi>third Command,</hi> which is the Subject of our present Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, as much as to any of the rest. The Command is given <hi>Negatively,</hi> and therefore speaks directly of a sin that is prohibited in it; though there are also many sins contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under the prohibition; but my present business is only to speak of that which the words do in terms express.</p>
            <p>Here then two things are to be observed.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:000582_0004_0FA7147B44497150"/>1. The sin which is prohibited, and that is, <hi>Taking the Name of God in vain.</hi> The word Translated, <hi>Take,</hi> firstly signifies, to lift up a thing, and it nextly aims at the <hi>words</hi> of men, the taking up of Gods Name into their mouths; although it also extends to thoughts and deeds; but it is the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer that I am at present to take notice of. <hi>The name of God</hi> is of great extent, for it includes in it, every thing of God, in which he hath made any discovery of himself to the Creature: but more expresly it intends, any word by which the Great God is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, whether <hi>Essentially</hi> or <hi>Personally</hi>; and so, every one of his <hi>Attributes,</hi> which are so many Letters in which he hath written his Name unto us, are here to be considered. The word, <hi>In vain</hi>; is sometimes used <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantively,</hi> and then it signifies <hi>Temerity</hi> &amp; <hi>false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> sometimes it is used <hi>Adverbially,</hi> and there it imports as much as, <hi>lightly, unnecessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily, unprofitably.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The danger in committing of this sin is discovered, in a severe Commination. <hi>For the Lord will not hold him guiltless,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The word that is translated, <hi>To hold guilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less,</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>gnifies in the first Conjugation, to be <hi>Pure, free, void</hi>; and in the Conjugation here used, it imports the treating of one as so;. It therefore aim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the expression; it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> q. d. he will certainly hold him a guilty person, and deal with him as such an one: such manner of expressions are used in the Scriptures, and contain a very awfull threatning in them:</p>

            <p>Though this be not all, yet it is one thing plainly pointed at in this command and than which I scarcely know any thing that calls for a more solemn and severe Testimony to be b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
