            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head type="sub">REMARKS ON THE PROCEEDINGS IN CONGRESS. JANUARY 20.</head>
            <p>THE following meſſage from the Preſident of the United States was communicated to the two Houſes.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                  </opener>
                  <p>AT the opening of the preſent ſeſſion of Congreſs, I mentioned that ſome circumſtances of an unwelcome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had lately occurred in relation to France; that our trade had ſuffered, and was ſuffering, extenſive injuries in the Weſt Indies from the cruizers and agents of the French Republic; and that communications had been received from its miniſter here which indicated danger of a further diſturbance of our commerce by its authority, and that
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031946_0003_0FEF5C66F371E430"/>
were, in other reſpects, far from agreeable: but that I reſerved for a ſpecial meſſage, a more particular commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication on this intereſting ſubject. This communication I now make.</p>
                  <p>The complaints of the French miniſter embraced moſt of the tranſactions of our government in relation to France, from an early period of the preſent war; which, therefore, it was neceſſary carefully to review. A col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection has been formed of letters and papers relating to thoſe tranſactions, which I now lay before you, with a letter to Mr. Pinckney, our miniſter at Paris, containing an examination of the notes of the French miniſter, and ſuch information as I thought might be uſeful to Mr. Pinckney, in any further repreſentations he might find ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be made to the French government. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate object of his miſſion was to make to that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſuch explanations of the principles and conduct of our own, as, by manifeſting our good faith, might remove all jealouſy and diſcontent, and maintain that harmony and good underſtanding with the French Republic, which it has been my conſtant ſolicitude to preſerve. A govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which required only a knowledge of the <hi>truth,</hi> to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify its meaſures, could not but be anxious to have this ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and frankly diſplayed.</p>

            <p>To give the <hi>letter,</hi> accompanying this meſſage, is impoſſible; nor would its inſertion here, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, anſwer any uſeful purpoſe; as it has alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy been publiſhed both in the public papers and in a pamphlet. It is, however, neceſſary to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it ſhould be read and well remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by every one, who is intereſted in the honour and happineſs of this country. <hi>Adet's</hi> charges againſt the Federal government, which were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batted in the November Cenſor, have here met
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031946_0004_0FEF5C781BCE7820"/>
with a more ample refutation; reaſoning that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can be overturned, becauſe founded on facts that never can be denied. The motives of the inſidious friendſhip of the French, from firſt to laſt, are completely unveiled: in place of a debt of gratitude, it is now clear that America owes them nothing but reſentment and contempt: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment for their treachery and contempt for their threats.</p>
            <p>As a compoſition, this letter reflects great ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour on the writer. Mr. Pickering as been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly called a ſucceſſor <hi>in form</hi> to the late Secretary of State; but, the judicious arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the perſpicuous ſtyle and the manly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of this voluminous ſtate paper, ſhows that he is not a ſucceſſor either in form or in ſubſtance to the bungling and prevaricating Randolph.</p>
            <p>Upon the reaſonable ſuppoſition, that very few, if any of my readers, ever ſee the Gallician Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette of Benjamin Franklin Bache, it may not be amiſs to take notice of the cenſure with which this clumſy tool of an unprincipled faction has ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the publication of Mr. Pickering's letter.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Executive pretended that they wiſh to preſerve a good underſtanding with the French Republic, and yet they are purſuing every mode which can have a <hi>tendency to embroil us with that country.</hi> The letter of <hi>man Timothy</hi> to Mr. PINCKNEY is a ſtrong evidence of this intention. This letter endeavours inſidiouſly to criminate the Republic for the conduct of the monarchy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains as <hi>much irritation as could be conveyed from the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration.</hi> What is moſt remarkable is, that the letter is deſigned as a guide to our miniſter, and yet is pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed here <hi>before</hi> it can have poſſibly reached France,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031946_0005_0FEF5C7B6B74AA10"/>
and indeed when it muſt be believed that the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the letter itſelf will reach that country at the ſame time. Is the matter or manner of this letter in the ſtyle of conciliation?</p>
               <p>Does it not, on the contrary, breathe a diſpoſition to excite new recriminations on the part of the Directory? Does it not ſeem deſigned to cloſe the door of amicable accommodation? Would the publication have been made, unleſs there exiſted a diſpoſition in our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to put France at defiance? If accommodation was the object, would the <hi>reflections have been made public againſt the French nation?</hi> That a letter deſigned as a kind of inſtruction to our miniſter ſhould have been made public <hi>before</hi> it reached him, is one among the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities which have characteriſed the adminiſtration.— If a reſtoration of harmony was in the ſerious contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of the Executive, he would have tranſmitted the letter and have kept the Directory ignorant of its irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating contents until every proſpect of accommodation was at an end, and <hi>then it would have been time enough to make it known in juſtification of the adminiſtration;</hi> but to do it at this time ſtrongly implies a diſpoſition to excite ſuch reſentments as ſhall put reconciliation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely out of the queſtion. It has ever been the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of thoſe who obſerved the conduct of the Executive, that they were the enemies of the French Republic, their declarations to the contrary notwithſtanding, and if any additional evidence was neceſſary to eſtabliſh the belief, the letter to Mr. PINCKNEY will not leave a doubt on the mind of any unprejudiced American.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Does not this ſound well from the man, who juſtified Citizen Adet's contemptuous appeal from the government to the people? Who publiſhed that appeal, and who, leſt its ſeditious tendency ſhould be defeated by delay, publiſhed an abſtract of it, with a commentary ſtill more inflammatory than the appeal itſelf?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:031946_0006_0FEF5CA31A714598"/>The French have a right to do whatever they pleaſe: inſult, beat, tread upon: brave the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, accuſe it of every crime that malice can invent; but the government of the United States muſt not think of retaliating, nor even of juſtifying itſelf to thoſe, before whom it has been ſo falſely and inſolently accuſed! The <hi>ſuſpended</hi> Adet tells the people of America, and the whole world, that the Federal Government has iſſued a declaration of <hi>inſidious</hi> neutrality; that it acts by <hi>chicane;</hi> that from the courts of juſtice <hi>no juſtice is to be expected;</hi> that the treaty with France has been <hi>violated;</hi> that, in ſhort, the conduct of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been marked by every trait of cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and perfidy. The Preſident would have been fully juſtified in a perfect retaliation; that is, in cauſing the refutation of theſe calumnious charges to be publiſhed <hi>in France,</hi> and that too in a language equally daring with that of Citizen Adet; but he has thought this beneath the reſpect due to himſelf and to the nation with whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence he has ſo long been, and yet is, honoured. He has, therefore, been content with juſtifying his conduct in the eyes of his conſtituents. Yet this is too much for the full grown grandchild of Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Franklin: it is "irritating," and calculated to "cloſe the door of amicable negociation." It is irritating for a man to deny the falſehoods that have been vomited forth againſt him, and to prove, to thoſe who has inveſted him with power, that he has not betrayed his truſt.</p>
            <p>Novel as this doctrine appears, neither Mr. Bache nor any of his friends can claim the honour of the invention. It is borrowed from the code of the Revolutionary Tribunal of France, that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031946_0007_0FEF5C7D1405E290"/>
hopper of the famous national mill, vulgarly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the guillotine. In this bloody court, <hi>no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi> is heard <hi>in favour of the accuſed.</hi> As much againſt him as you pleaſe, ſo that there be no loſs of time.</p>
            <p>This was the form of proceſs intended for the Preſident and his officers of ſtate. Citizen Adet diſcharges his duty as <hi>accuſateur public,</hi> conſigns them over to the "national juſtice," and his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate Citizen Bache now complains, that they have had the impudence to reply.</p>
            <p>I ſhall leave guillotine lawyer Bache to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his pleadings and to receive his merited re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, bundles of aſſignats and millions of honeſt curſes, and ſhall juſt take notice of one or two articles of accuſation which were not contained in the Diplomatic Blunderbuſs, but which have come to light through Mr. Pickering's letter.— <q>Indeed, ſays he, the French Miniſter has diſcovered an aptitude to complain. I may cite, as inſtances, his letters of the 9th of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary and 3d of March 1796: the former, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the colours of France, which he had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the United States, were not <hi>perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently fixed and diſplayed before Congreſs:</hi> the latter, becauſe ſome printers of almanacs or other periodical publications in the United States, in arranging the names of the foreign miniſters and agents reſident amongſt us, <hi>had placed thoſe of Great-Britain before thoſe of France and Spain!</hi> Mr. Adet deſired my <hi>declaration in writing</hi> that the government of the United States had no concern in printing the works in which the agents of the French republic were
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031946_0008_0FEF5C7E9C0877C8"/>
regiſtered after thoſe of Great-Britain, and that <hi>the works themſelves might be ſuppreſſed.</hi> I gave him an anſwer in writing with my conſent to his publiſhing it in the newſpapers, agreeably to his requeſt. The anſwer ſtates that in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of this kind the government did not and could not interfere. With regard to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, I muſt obſerve, that in what concerns our foreign relations, the Preſident being the ſole repreſentative of the people of the United States, they were properly preſented to him. He received them with all poſſible reſpect, and directed them to be depoſited with our national archives, that both might be preſerved with equal care.</q>

            <p>The flag ſhould, by right, have been permanent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſplayed before the eyes of Congreſs, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind them of their duty towards the "terrible nation;" but then, the Citizen did not perceive that a great difficulty would have occurred from our having two chambers. To have cut aſunder the emblem of fraternal love would have been a portentous ſign; and, though the members of the Senate, who would have wiſhed to rally under a ſans-culotte rag, were few in number, yet there is no reaſon to believe that they would have pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently left their friends of the other Houſe in the ſole enjoyment of the honourable ombrage. They would have wrangled like the Goddeſſes for the apple, or, rather, like dogs for a bone. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, undoubtedly, foreſaw this, and therefore he wiſely determined to take it from them altogether, and to lock it up ſafely with the Archives of the United States, where neither moth nor ruſt, nor any thing elſe, doth <hi>corrupt.</hi> How different would
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031946_0009_0FEF5CAF5636B4E0"/>
its ſituation have been, had it remained continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſplayed in the Hall!</p>
            <p>If my memory does not deceive me, the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican flag was carried to the Convention by Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Barney. This man has ever ſhown an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common zeal for the honour of the flag of his country; for, I remember, that he wrote a very pathetic letter from Jamaica, addreſſed to a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Congreſs, expreſſing the grief of his at once noble and tender heart, at ſeeing the American flag hung up <hi>reversed</hi> under that of Great-Britain, while he himſelf was in irons, and conſequently unable "to avenge his dear country's wrongs." Since thoſe unhappy days Citizen Barney is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a French commodore of two frigates, and will probably riſe to the rank of Admiral, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary winds ſhould not drive him in the way of the cruizers of the enemy. He was ſometime ſkulking about the Weſt-India ſeas, and <hi>to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venged of the Britiſh</hi> for inſulting the American flag, what does the brave commodore do, but ſeize an American merchantman, ſwing her flag up <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versed</hi> under that of France, and clap the captain in irons. There's <hi>retaliation</hi> for you. There's avenging his "dear country's wrongs."!—A few ſuch inſtances of patriotiſm will, I hope, convince the Britiſh, and every other inſolent overbearing nation, that, however vengeance may ſleep for a time, the American flag will never be inſulted with impunity, while there are Barneys in exiſtence.</p>
            <p>To return and take farewel of the French co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; it is well enough to obſerve, that, on the day or day after, the French Miniſter made his complaint to the Secretary of State, reſpecting
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031946_0010_0FEF5C94B7DA5AE8"/>
the fate of the colours, the very ſame complaint was made in Bache's Gazette. Not that I would inſinuate that Mr. Bache is in the pay of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and that his paper has no other ſupport: the minds of the public have long been made up as to that point. But it is ſomething worth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, as it ſtrongly tends to prove, that exactly the ſame thought may ſtrike, at the ſame moment, two perſons who have <hi>not</hi> the <hi>leaſt</hi> connection with each other.</p>
            <p>The complaint againſt the <hi>Almanac-Makers</hi> has more of the ridiculous in it than any thing to be found on the records of upſtart apiſhneſs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the deſpots of Paris had ſtyled themſelves the legiſlators of the Univerſe, it entered into the ſapient ſkull of Citizen Adet, that they were ſo in reality, and that, of courſe, it was a ſpecies of treaſon to rank their agent beneath thoſe of other powers.</p>
            <p>This complaint ſhows how narrowly they watch us. They dog us like our murderers. They are every where, and in every ſhape. They inſinuate themſelves into all companies, among every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the people. They tent all our actions, words and looks. To rate the number of their ſpies, ſpread over the United States, at five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, is keeping far within compaſs.</p>
            <p>The demanding of a <hi>poſitive declaration,</hi> that the government had <hi>no hand in the publications</hi> in queſtion, proves clearly that the Citizen looked upon that government as in a ſtate of abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on his own; and his requeſting that the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031946_0011_0FEF5C6881A36730"/>
Almanacs, &amp;c. "might be ſuppreſſed," gives us a tolerable idea of that liberty of the preſs, which we ſhall enjoy, when we fall under the juriſdiction of the French.—"That the works themſelves might be <hi>suppreſsed</hi>"! It would appear that the ſun-beams of liberty, that have lately broken in upon the French, have had no very great effect on Citizen Adet. I have always ſaid, that they know nothing of freedom but the name, and here we have a proof of it. The Citizen thought that our government was like his own; that the laws were a mere mockery, and that we were as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely in bondage as the ſlaves of Paris, who are led to the guillotine for printing the Lord's Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or the Decalogue. Poor miniſter of the "ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible nation"! How muſt he have ſmarted at my anſwer to his Blunderbuſs, and how will he ſmart if he ſhould remain here till I print an Almanac! I will put his name beneath thoſe of the Envoys of the Savages of America; for I am ſure every one will allow, that the nations they repreſent are far more reputable and humane than his. I will range him after Citizens Complanter, Bull-Dog, and Dog's-Head. Should we receive a miniſter from the Hottentots, who wear unemptied guts round their carcaſſes, as the more brutiſh <hi>fonctio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naires publics</hi> in France do their tricolored ſcarfs; ſhould we receive a miniſter from this polite peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that of regenerated France ſhall come after him in my Almanac.</p>
            <p>If the Citizen was ignorant enough to ſuppoſe, that the government could ſuppreſs one publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he certainly muſt believe that its power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to others alſo; and then, how comes it to paſs, that he had not demanded the <hi>suppreſſion</hi> of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031946_0012_0FEF5C6BD0542148"/>
ſome other works, that I could mention (if I dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed), which ſeem to be better calculated for giving offence than a poor inoffenſive Almanac. But, in theſe, I ſuppoſe, the Citizen found nothing to wound that little ſomething, which, it ſeems, tic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kles the hearts of republicans as well as thoſe of royaliſts. It is diverting enough to ſee the vanity of a democratic citizen breaking out into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints about precedence; about the poſt of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in a two-penny Almanac, and an Almanac too of the <hi>"Old Style."</hi> The reptiles that have ſprung up out of the ruins of the French nobility, are ten thouſand times more bloated with vanity than that nobility, or any other, ever was. They know they are deſpiſed, and they wiſh to obtain by force what the will refuſes them. They have fully verified the old maxim: "Set a beggar on horſe-back, and he'll ride to the devil."</p>
            <p>There are ſome other facts that Mr. Pickering's letter has brought to light, which will command attention another time; for the preſent I muſt leave them, to record an event that reflects as much honour on the people of America as it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes them proſperity: I mean the election of Mr. John Adams to the office of Preſident of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:031946_0015_0FEF5C81253B99D8"/>The friends of America, all over the world, will congratulate her on this event; will applaud the wiſdom of her choice. Mr. Adams's learning, his wiſdom, and his integrity, are univerſally known, and as univerſally acknowledged, except by the partizans of democratic tyranny. To this he has long been a declared and formidable foe, and that he will ever continue ſo, the ſteady per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance exhibited in his paſt life is a ſufficient ſecurity.</p>
            <p>At any time whatever, to ſee ſuch a man at the head of the Federal Government, muſt have been a ſource of ſatisfaction to every well-diſpoſed mind; but at the preſent criſis it is particularly ſo. Well aſſured that he is neither to be deceived nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated, the at once inſidious and inſolent ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of our proſperity and independence will put on the appearance, at leaſt, of moderation: and though juſtice for the paſt is not in their power, they will be deterred from any further commiſſion of injuſtice. How much they dread his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is beſt determined by their efforts to keep him from the Preſidential Chair. They foreſaw that his election would be the death-ſtroke to their intrigues at Philadelphia, and eventually to the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their abominable principles in this exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive country. That infidels may for once prove prophets, is my ſincere and hearty wiſh, as I believe it is of nine-tenths of the community.</p>

to give.

            <p>It is a notorious fact, that in this election, the partizans of France, or rather of the French ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, were ranged in oppoſition to the friends of the Federal Government. I do not inſinuate that Mr. Jefferſon would now wiſh to ſee this government ſubverted; but, it is well known, it has been often aſſerted and as often proved, that he has ever been oppoſed to the principles on which it is eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031946_0017_0FEF5C5D8D081AF8"/>
and on which it muſt ſtand, if it ſtands at all. His partiality for the deſtructive ſyſtem of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtart rulers of France is alſo well known. His <hi>philosophy</hi> and politics perfectly harmonize with theirs. His partizans, ſo far from denying his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>a deiſt,</hi> defend it: and his public recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the infamous Tom Paine's Rights of Man, as a means of oppoſing <q>the political hereſies which have ſprung up amongſt us,</q> ſufficiently explains his political creed.</p>
            <p>That the French regicides looked to him as a proper inſtrument for facilitating their encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the independence of America, no one can doubt, that has read Fauchet's intercepted let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the menacing notes of Citizen Adet, and that has been a witneſs of the electioneering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of their hirelings.</p>
            <p>Proof has been too often given to need repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here, that the great object of the French has ever been, and ſtill is, to cut off all communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between this country and Great Britain, as the only effectual means of rendering us totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent on themſelves. Conſcious of their own inability, in a fair competition, to ſupplant Great Britain as the manufacturer for America; and conſcious alſo that the inſeparable and growing intereſts of the two countries muſt produce a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect reconciliation, and may finally lead to an alliance that would for ever fruſtrate their projects, they have miſſed no opportunity of exerting their influence to deſtroy an intercourſe, dangerous to their ambition and to that alone. The endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of their partizans have uniformly tended to this point. They have, indeed, varied their
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031946_0018_0FEF5CC2CA1803D0"/>
means, but the end has always been the ſame.— Firſt, it was propoſed (and the propoſition was brought forward at a favourable juncture) to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the trade with Britain by impoſing heavier duties on goods imported thence than on thoſe imported from France. The pretext, the miſerable pretext, for this, was, <hi>to force Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain into a commercial treaty with America!</hi> Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity unmatched, and almoſt incredible! The men, who brought forward this propoſition, have by the current of ſubſequent events, been led to declare, that America ſtands in need of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial treaties with <hi>no nation on earth, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with Britain!</hi> It was hoped that the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate would adopt the regulations, propoſed and paſſed in the other Houſe, and it was naturally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that an attempt to <hi>force</hi> a treaty down the throat of the Britiſh would produce juſt a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry effect. The Senate ſaw through the veil of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed hoſtility, and the Executive took the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary meaſures to accompliſh, <hi>without force,</hi> what the inſidious propoſals profeſſed to have in view, but what they were in reality intended to prevent.</p>
            <p>But we muſt not quit this ſubject without hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Citizen Fauchet, of treacherous memory, who is a moſt excellent expoſitor of dark points. <q>The ſeſſions of 1793 and 1794, ſays he, had given importance to the <hi>republican party</hi> [vulgarly call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>French faction</hi>], and ſolidity to its <hi>accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> The propoſitions of Mr. Madiſon, or his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of a navigation act, <hi>of which Mr. Jefferson was originally the author,</hi> ſapped the Britiſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, now an integral part of the financiering ſyſtem.</q>—Thus we ſee, then, that the famous <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:031946_0019_0FEF5C6E39DC6890"/>
that were to ſap the Britiſh intereſt, or trade, the revenue ariſing from which was become an integral part of the financiering ſyſtem, were aſcribed to a wrong perſon; and that patriot Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon, who has been honoured with ſuch loads of democratic applauſe on this account, was no more than the paſſive inſtrument of the then Secretary of State; he was no more, in the opinion of Fauchet at leaſt, than the fore-horſe of the French team, that the Virginian Philoſopher, with his long whip, was driving through the mire of oppoſition. Full well I remember the time. The little man bridled up and aſſumed a vaſt deal of ſelf-impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but we are now told that the trappings were not his own, and are left to ſuppoſe, that his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was nothing more than that of a quadruped leader, whoſe head the partial clown has hung with bells or decorated with garlands.—I do not like this compariſon. The horſe is a noble, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic animal; and we all know how offenſive ſuch ideas are to republican minds, though figur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atively uſed. They do not go in teams, otherwiſe I might have been led to one of thoſe ſagacious and ever honoured, though comparatively dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive creatures, on which the Redeemer of the World made his public entry into Jeruſalem.</p>
            <p>Mr. Jefferſon quitted the field before the ſtormy times of <hi>ſequeſtration</hi> and <hi>total prohibition</hi> came on; but, if we may believe Fauchet (who certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was in all the ſecrets of the antifederal party), we ſhall find that retirement was not the only thing he ſighed for. "Conſult Munroe" (ſays Fauchet, in his letter to the Convention), <q>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult Munroe; he had <hi>apprized me</hi> of the men whom the current of events had dragged along
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031946_0020_0FEF5CB85C2E89E0"/>
as bodies devoid of weight. His friend Madi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is alſo an <hi>honeſt</hi> man</q> [in the French ſenſe of the word, of courſe]. <q>Jefferſon, on whom the <hi>patriots</hi> caſt their eyes to ſucceed the Preſident, has foreſeen theſe criſes. He <hi>prudently</hi> retired.</q> —For what?—To enjoy the tranquil pleaſures of a country life? To become one of <q>God's choſen people, <hi>if he ever had</hi> a choſen people,</q> as he himſelf calls the cultivators of the land?— It was not for this. He did not retire merely to wander through the groves, to liſten to the oaten reed of the ſmutty ſwains, nor to ſolace his limbs in the ſilver brooks of his modern Arcadia; no, nor to inhale the fragrance of its tobacco-fields neither. <q>
                  <hi>He</hi> prudently <hi>retired, to avoid making a figure,</hi> againſt his inclination, <hi>in ſcenes,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of which will ſoon or late be brought to light.</q> —Thank ye, Fauchet. Had it not been for the clue, which you have here given us, ſome artful people might yet continue to aſſert, and ſome ſilly people to believe, that <q>Mr. Jefferſon retired from the <hi>foppery</hi> of the <hi>monarchical</hi> court of Philadelphia, with no other motive than that of adding to the ſtock of philoſophy, to the litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry honour of America, and the good of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Jefferſon did, then, foreſee "theſe criſes," theſe troubleſome times; he foreſaw the violent conduct of the Houſe of Repreſentatives: he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw that the oppoſition to the exciſe law would end where it did, in open rebellion; and foreſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, <q>he <hi>prudently</hi> retired, to avoid mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a figure <hi>againſt his inclination,</hi>
               </q> on the ſide of government (which, as Secretary of State, he muſt have done), leſt thereby he ſhould loſe the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031946_0021_0FEF5C86E4C97B00"/>
future ſupport of the <hi>"patriots,"</hi> who had <q>caſt their eyes on him to ſucceed the Preſident.</q> The partizans of Mr. Jefferſon ſay, that ſuch was the opinion of <hi>Fauchet only!</hi> This is preciſely what I want them to allow. The opinion of the French miniſter aſſuredly became the opinion of his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and, it is their opinion reſpecting Mr. Jef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferſon's principles that I am endeavouring to make appear. Whether they were deceived by appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, or not, is of little conſequence now. It is from what <hi>they thought</hi> of Mr. Jefferſon, whether right or wrong, that we are to form an eſtimate of their motives in attempting to impoſe him, as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, on the people of the United States.</p>
            <p>Now that the electioneering manoeuvres have failed, the hirelings of France pretend, that Adet's Notes were by no means intended to have the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which has been looked upon as their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal object; and that it is the height, the very ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of abſurdity, to ſuppoſe any ſuch thing, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what is now reduced to a certainty as indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable as any that ever was eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>The Notes in ſubſtance declare, that the French are offended at the conduct of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and his council, that they have reſolved on ſeizing our veſſels, and on breaking off all diplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic communication with us, till the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment returns to itſelf; not forgetting to hint at the ſame time, and that in terms comprehenſible to the meaneſt capacity, that a change of <hi>men</hi> as well as meaſures, is the only means of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>As to <hi>nominating</hi> the ſucceſſors of General Waſhington and his officers of ſtate, that could
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031946_0022_0FEF5C98A9BE95A0"/>
have anſwered no uſeful end; that part of the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs was prudently left to their faithful ſtipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries, who immediately exclaimed, as if from ſudden inſpiration, that Mr. Jefferſon was the only man capable of making our peace with the juſtly enraged, "terrible republic." However, leſt we ſhould deſpiſe the vociferations of this vile herd, Citizen Adet takes care to drag Mr. Jefferſon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his firſt Note, and that in ſuch a way as leaves not the leaſt doubt as to his object in ſo doing.</p>
            <p>Still, however, there would be ſome little lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude for diſpute, were the <hi>time</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating theſe Notes left out of the queſtion.</p>
            <p>All the pretended grounds of complaint, among which I include the ratification of the Britiſh treaty, exiſted in the month of July, 1795. How came it to paſs, then, that the Convention of France, whom I hope no body will accuſe of an over degree of lenity and forbearance; how came it to paſs, that theſe vengeful deſpots, who ſcent the blood of diſobedient nations from afar, and are ever ready to ruſh upon their prey; how came it that they ſhould reſerve their threats till the 2d of July 1796? Again; ſuppoſing for a moment, that their wrath had lain dormant all this while, how did it happen that the determination to menace us with chaſtiſement, which was taken on the 2d of July, was kept a profound ſecret till the 27th of October, four entire months all but five days, in a ſeaſon of the year when even two months is a long paſſage from France to the United States? Mr. Pickering expreſſed his ſurpriſe, and well he might, that the violent reſolutions of the Convention ſhould be notified at ſo late an hour, and without any new ſubject of complaint. Had a redreſs of the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031946_0023_0FEF5CB0DC1E93F0"/>
injuries complained of been the object of the Notes, and of the meaſures they communicate, why were they delayed for a year and four months, and then poured out upon us all of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, on the 27th of October, 1796, ſeven days previous to the election?</p>
            <p>The manner, too, of the communication clearly proves its intent. If reparation of wrongs had been the real end propoſed, why was the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication not left with the government, which alone could make that reparation? Why did Citizen Adet treat with the people? And why did he do this before it was poſſible for him to know what anſwer he ſhould receive from the government? His appeal from the government to the people was an outrage of decency, a violation of the law of nations, and a direct attack on the ſovereignty of the United States; it was an act that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention itſelf had recalled Genet for <hi>talking of</hi> only; and why ſhould they now authorize its <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,</hi> unleſs to anſwer ſome end of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry importance? It was eaſy to foreſee that the Preſident would not publiſh theſe Notes, till ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a refutation of the charges they contain, and then they would not only have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared diſarmed, but alſo too late for effecting their purpoſe.</p>
            <p>To the concluſion, neceſſarily reſulting from theſe obſervations, it has been objected, 1ſt, that the Convention could not be informed of Gen. Waſhington's intention to reſign, at the time when they gave their miniſter his inſtructions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could not poſſibly do it with a view of fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening the people into a choice of Mr. Jefferſon: and 2dly, that Adet could have no ſuch intention,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031946_0024_0FEF5CC544338BD8"/>
or he would have publiſhed his notes at an earlier day, to give them time to reach every quarter of the Union, before the election came on.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the firſt of theſe objections, I allow that it is poſſible, that the ſpies of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention had not been able to apprize them of the Preſident's deſign; I allow that that arch fiend, formerly biſhop of Autun, who had wound his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tean form into all the circles of Philadelphia; I will allow that even the devil, their conſtant cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, had not apprized them of it; but what is that to the purpoſe? Citizen Fauchet, though apprized of a good deal, was not apprized of it; yet he was apprized, that <q>the <hi>patriots</hi> had fixed their eyes on <hi>Mr. Jefferſon</hi> to ſucceed the Preſident;</q> and of this he informed the Convention. It was not, therefore, neceſſary that they ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized of General Waſhington's intention to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. Mr. Jefferſon was to be oppoſed to whomſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould appear as a candidate for the office, whether Waſhington, or Adams, or any body elſe; and as the French knew when the election muſt take place as well as we did, time was all they had to attend to. So that this mighty objection is at once ſo completely done away, that even fools may walk over it blindfolded.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond objection, that Adet could not publiſh his menaces with an intention of influenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people in their choice, becauſe the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion did not take place time enough to reach every quarter of the Union, previous to the day of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, every man, however careleſs an obſerver he may be of the politics of the different ſtates muſt
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031946_0025_0FEF5C5F13BBA6A8"/>
ſee that the publication took place ſoon enough and not a moment too late.</p>
            <p>There were two notes, the firſt was intended to influence the people in their choice of electors, and the laſt to influence the electors in their choice of the Preſident. One was publiſhed ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven days only before the people met, and the other about as many days before the aſſembling of the electors. That this was not time enough for them to reach every ſtate is evident, and it is as evident, that, to accompliſh their object, it was not neceſſary they ſhould. The ſentiments of the people <hi>to the north of the Delaware,</hi> and of thoſe <hi>to the south of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomack,</hi> were as well known before the election as they are at this day. Pennſylvania and Maryland alone were juſtly looked upon as balancing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two candidates; and ſeven days was a ſpace of time juſt ſufficient to give circulation to the threats, without leaving time for the people and their electors to recover from the panic, that it was hoped they would produce, before the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was over. The Jacobins, as Burke obſerves, are very accurate calculators. They never miſs the nick of time. They know to a moment when to look big, and when to fawn: when to give you the fraternal hug, and when to knock you down.</p>
            <p>The reſult has proved, that all that was to be feared or hoped for, by either party, lay in theſe two States, and therefore the Frenchman's blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbuſs was diſcharged juſt in time to have all the influence that it was probable, or poſſible, it ſhould have. I feel a ſatisfaction, however, in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting, that it had none at all. The votes for Mr. Adams in Maryland prove that French principles have loſt, in place of gaining ground, in that State;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031946_0026_0FEF5CC70EA16C20"/>
and, as to poor Pennſylvania, though appearances are againſt her, though <hi>fourteen</hi> French votes to <hi>one</hi> American one brand her with ignominy, yet I hope, with the indulgence of the reader, to prove, that this unfortunate State, this faireſt ſiſter of the family, appears much more culpable than ſhe real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is, and that her tranſgreſſion has proceeded from her amiable weakneſs rather than from any radical vices.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate the electors are not choſen for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate diſtricts. Each diſtrict does not begin <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> cloſe the election of its electors; but, fifteen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons become candidates for the electorſhip of the whole ſtate. The ſame men are put up and voted for in all the diſtricts; the whole number of votes for each man are at laſt collected by the governor (whoſe conduct in the preſent election I would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud, were I not afraid the honeſt reader would kick me for it), who then iſſues his proclamation declaring who are the perſons choſen. From this regulation it follows, that a majority of a ſingle vote, upon the whole number of freemen, may give the ſtate the appearance of unanimity on a point on which it is nearly equally divided. This was not far from being the caſe in the election we are now ſpeaking of. According to the return, one would be led to imagine, that fourteen out of fifteen Pennſylvanians were for Jefferſon; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the fact is, that, out of <hi>twenty thouſand</hi> votes, his electors had a majority of no more than about <hi>one hundred and ſeventy,</hi> number that, when com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the whole maſs, is hardly worthy of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing called a caſting voice. So that the people in Pennſylvania may be looked upon as having been equally divided between the two candidates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:031946_0027_0FEF5C6FC999C380"/>It is fair alſo to obſerve, that this ſtate labours under diſadvantages, in this reſpect, that no other ſtate does. Hers is preciſely that climate that ſuits the vagabonds of Europe: here they may baſk in ſummer, and lay curled up in winter, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear of ſcorching in one ſeaſon or freezing in the other. Accordingly hither they come in ſhoals, juſt roll themſelves a-ſhore, and begin to ſwear and poll away as if they had been bred to the buſineſs from their infancy. She has, too, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily acquired a reputation for the mildneſs, or rather the feebleneſs, of her laws. <q>There's no gallows in Pennſylvania!</q> Theſe glad tidings have rung through all the democratic club-rooms, all the dark aſſemblies of traitors, all the dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and cells of England, Scotland and Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. Hence it is that we are overwhelmed with the refuſe, the ſweepings, of thoſe kingdoms, the offal of the jail and the gibbet. Hence it is that we ſee ſo many faces that never looked comely but in the pillory, limbs that are awkward out of chains, and necks that ſeem made to be ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Among all this refugee, renegade, and feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous crew, Mr. Adams was not diſhonoured with a ſingle vote; and yet, after all, he would have had a great majority, had it not been for the unanimity with which he was oppoſed by the counties <hi>ſo lately in a ſtate of open rebellion,</hi> and by the <hi>county</hi> (not the city) of Philadelphia. Next to the honour of having the ſupport of all the men of property, ſenſe and virtue, in this populous ſtate, the Preſident muſt eſteem that of being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected

                  <p>There's a fine Congreſs-man for you!—This was the man who, in the preſence of his many-headed ſovereign, in town meeting aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, propoſed to kick the Britiſh Treaty to hell; and it was for this patriotic motion, I preſume, that his gracious liege choſe him for a repreſentative. Diſcreet choice! immaculate delegate! infallible ſovereign! If there's a damn'd rotten raſcally borough in the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, that ever made ſuch a choice as this, I'll be bound to cut my throat, and ſuffer the ſans-culotte ſovereign of the county of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, the hob ſnob ſniggar-ſnee-ers of Germantown, to kick me about in my blood, till my corpſe is as ugly and filthy and diſguſting as their living carcaſſes are.</p>

From the intended effects of this nefarious, this deteſtable project, we have been preſerved, not by the counter endeavours of the friends to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for theſe were at once tardy and illy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted; not by the influence of the public prints, for three-fourths of them aided the cauſe of the treacherous foe; not by that pretended light which we have acquired in theſe illuminating days, for in all thoſe places where men are moſt converſant in what is called politics, there the French have received the greateſt ſupport; but by that <hi>plain good ſenſe,</hi> the natural effect of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence operating on a ſound mind. It is this quality, in a people far preferable to all the brilliancy of wit and talents, that has ſaved America in ſo many perils, in ſpite of all the vile and ſubtle arts of enemies foreign and domeſtic, and even in ſpite of national paſſions and prejudices.</p>

            <p>Now, hang me, Mr. News-Monger, if I believe this laſt aſſertion; for, though I am none of the moſt incredulous; though I know the magic, and more than magic, power of liberty; though I might even raiſe my mind to the conception of nonſenſe, and really believe that this enchantreſs did <hi>shed</hi> a <hi>glow,</hi> and a <hi>glow</hi> of <hi>light</hi> too, and that that <hi>light</hi> was <hi>felt;</hi> though it is poſſible that I might be elevated or ſtupid enough to believe all this, or raſcal enough to pretend to believe it, yet I never can or will believe that there was no "approach to <hi>intemperance</hi>" at this civic feſtival; unleſs want of caſh prevented it.—When I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the pious office of Gazette-Man, I will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a ſtricter adherence to truth.</p>

all know, that, in literature, a News-monger ranks next after a dray-horſe.</p>
            <p>Now to the <hi>Toaſts</hi> that <hi>were drank,</hi> and that I have kept too long from the thirſty reader.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE DAY—may it ever be a feſtival to freemen; and the alliance which it gave birth to, be regarded, as a key ſtone in the arch of liberty—Muſic, <hi>Yankee doodle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The People—knowledge to diſcern their rights and ſpirit and firmneſs to aſſert them.—<hi>Reveil du Peuple.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The United States—may they ever be an aſylum for the oppreſſed, and become a terror to oppreſſors.</p>
            <p>As they are now to the vile, infamous gallic oppreſſors of our commerce, I ſuppoſe?</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Republic of France—may ſhe be as diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in peace, as ſhe is formidable in war—that her happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may allure other nations into an imitation of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.—<hi>Ca Ira.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. The Batavian Republic—may her experience in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct other nations to ſhun a tyrant's graſp, far a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's embrace.—<hi>La Carmagnole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Excellent irony!</p>
            <p n="6">6. The Revolutionary Army of the United States— may the fruits of their labours be no longer enjoyed by the enemies of American Independence—<hi>Lexington march.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is to ſay; "riſe, ſans-culottes, and ſeize on the property of the rich!"</p>
            <p n="7">7. The memory of thoſe heroes, who fell in defence of American Liberty—may the inſcription upon their tombs,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031946_0032_0FEF5C886BC56220"/>
call a tear from gratitude, and a bluſh from <hi>apoſtacy.</hi>—So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn muſic.</p>
            <p n="8">8. The philoſophers and patriots, who planned and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the American Revolution—may the ſplendor of their actions and the dignity of their meaſures, teach go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, that <hi>honeſty</hi> is the beſt policy.</p>
            <p n="9">9. The Conſtitution of the United States—may it prove an effectual, and not a <hi>nominal check</hi> on the <hi>deſigns of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We underſtand all this perfectly well. The charge of <hi>apoſtacy,</hi> the hint at <hi>dishoneſty,</hi> and the check on the <hi>deſigns of ambition,</hi> are taken from Paine's moſt impudent and infamous letter to Gen. Waſhington. Would that their beer had been drugged with ſomething that would for ever, aye for ever, have ſilenced their factious tongues!</p>
            <p n="10">10. The Commonwealth of Pennſylvania, may ſhe be as diſtinguiſhed in the cauſe of republicaniſm, as ſhe has been conſpicuous in that of humanity.</p>
            <p>"Poor Pennſylvania keeps no gallows!" ſays a modern poem, in which <hi>gallows,</hi> with ſingular elegance and harmony, rhymes to <hi>Dallas.</hi> Poor unfortunate ſtate! Look at the men who extol thy <hi>humanity,</hi> and then bluſh at it.</p>
            <p n="11">11. The Freedom of the Preſs, may this palladium of our rights ever remain uninfluenced by power, unbiaſſed by party, and unſeduced by <hi>corruption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This laſt toaſt might have been ſpared in tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the feelings of Citizen Adet, and Mr. Bache.</p>
            <p n="12">
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:031946_0033_0FEF5CAA5DCCDC48"/>12. The memory of Franklin and Rittenhouſe—may their <hi>example</hi> inſtruct the philoſopher and the ſtateſman, that true glory conſiſts in <hi>doing good to mankind.</hi>—So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn muſic.</p>
            <p>That deiſm is philoſophy no one will deny, and therefore I cannot diſpute the claim here prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the title; but what good did Rittenhouſe do to mankind? Dr. Ruſh, indeed, ſays, that he did a great deal, and particularly to his own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but, with all due ſubmiſſion to the hyperbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical bombaſt of Dr. Ruſh, and his <hi>eulogium</hi> on the <hi>politics</hi> of Mr. Rittenhouſe, I never heard of any good to mankind, and particularly America, that he did, except determining the boundaries of ſome of the States, <q>which he did with <hi>great preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion?</hi>
               </q> and which I could have done as well as he, had I received the ſame pay for it. One ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſervice, indeed, he rendered his country, and that <hi>gratis</hi> too: he volunteered as <hi>president</hi> of that ſeditious club, the Democratic Society of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, and he himſelf ſigned the inflammato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reſolves againſt the exciſe law, which encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged the malcontents to riſe in open rebellion, for the quelling of which, reader, you and I have paid, and ſtill pay, a portion of our earnings.— The devil take ſuch "<hi>good</hi> to mankind," I ſay! —Doctor Ruſh is a very fine man, to be ſure, and he writes in a fine Doctor-like manner; but the remorſeleſs Doctor Ruſh ſhall <hi>bleed me</hi> till I am as white as this paper, before I'll allow that this was "doing good to mankind."</p>
            <p>Mr. Rittenhouſe's real friends have too much diſcretion to compliment his underſtanding at the expenſe of his heart. They confeſs that his ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and want of political knowledge expoſed
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031946_0034_0FEF5CB9E2751B20"/>
him to the duplicity of thoſe ſubtle fiends in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhape, who were at the bottom of the demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratic inſtitution, and who only wanted the weight of his name. But his eulogiſt will inſiſt that he was ſo profound, ſo farſighted a politician, that he even ſcented the delicious days of republican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm <hi>twenty years</hi> before they arrived! Nay, ſuch is the zeal of Dr. Ruſh, that he vows and declares his friend was <hi>born a republican;</hi> though every one knows, that he was born under the royal go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Britain. But, don't let us miſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrue the Doctor. He means a <hi>mental</hi> republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. <hi>Born</hi> a <hi>mental</hi> republican! Upon my ſoul it is a wonder he had not traced his republicaniſm a little further back, and turned the eulogium on his deceaſed ſubject into a lecture of anatomy.</p>
            <p>Either Mr. Rittenhouſe was the dupe of the Democratic Society, or he was not. If he was, the eulogium on his politics was as unjuſt as it was abſurd; if he was not, the eulogium on his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart was more ſo. In ſhort all that is ſaid, in this performance, of Mr. Rittenhouſe's philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, ſhould have been better ſaid, and all that is ſaid of his politics ſhould have been omitted. The former is a dry unintereſting narrative, and the latter ſo glaring a departure from truth, that it will attract but little more reſpect for his memory, than the hog's-waſh <hi>toaſts</hi> of the factious Society of which he was Preſident.</p>
            <p>We now come to <hi>Doctor Franklin's</hi> 
               <q>good to mankind.</q>—As a politician, his wiſhing to give up the fiſheries and Weſtern Poſts, for fear of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending France, is a convincing proof of his merit,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031946_0035_0FEF5C6099CFC9C0"/>
and muſt render a toaſt to his memory particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſing to Citizen Adet. As a <hi>moraliſt</hi> the Doctor's <hi>"example"</hi> is certainly a uſeful one; more eſpecially in a country like this that is thinly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited. "Increaſe and multiply," is an injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that this great man had continually in his mind; and ſuch was his zeal in the fulfilment of it, that he paid very little attention to time or place or perſon.</p>
            <p n="13">13. The Arts and Sciences; May the former be culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated for our comfort, and the latter for our ſecurity.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The ſiſter Republics of America and France; As the exertions of France contributed to our freedom, may the exertions of America never tend to her oppreſſion. <hi>Marſeillois hymn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="15">15. Peace, Liberty and Independence; may we culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the one as neceſſary to our proſperity; cheriſh the other as eſſential to our happineſs; and never proſtitute the latter to ambition or tyranny.</p>
            <p n="16">16. The <hi>Republic of Great-Britain;</hi> may the <hi>preſent year</hi> witneſs a jubilee, as neceſſary to the happineſs of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons as to the tranquillity of mankind. <hi>Britons ſtrike home.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I preſume that Doctor Prieſtly gave this toaſt; that ſame loyal Doctor Prieſtly, who in juſtifying himſelf to the people of Birmingham, told them that he had toaſted "the king and conſtitution." —About this gentleman I ſhall ſay more by-and-by; at preſent I would aſk, how it happens, that all the declared enemies of Great-Britain, pray that ſhe may become a <hi>Republic!</hi> Is this a proof of their looking upon ſuch a change as a bleſſing, or as a curſe?—"Britons <hi>ſtrike home.</hi>" That is, to the heart of your ſovereign.—No; you
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031946_0036_0FEF5CB4EF91C7B8"/>
ſpiteful, bloody-minded ſans-culottes; Britons, true Britons, ſcorn your inſinuation, and reject your ſanguinary precept with horror. When they <hi>ſtrike home,</hi> it is againſt thoſe foes of their king and their country, who have the courage to face them: as for impotent enemies like you, whoſe proweſs is confined to malicious wiſhes, ſpued out over your muddy beverage, you are too much honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their contempt.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Spain, the friend of France, and the United States; may our treaty with her, never give way to Mr. Jay's.</p>
            <p>This <hi>friend</hi> of the United States, has juſt declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed war againſt Great Britain, and one of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is, that Great Britain, in her treaty with A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, <hi>has ſacrificed the intereſts of Spain!</hi> There's <hi>friendship</hi> for you now! Did you ever hear of ſuch friendſhip in your life?</p>
            <p n="19">19. The Governor of the Common-wealth of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania.</p>
            <p n="20">20. A ſpeedy relief to Thomas Muir, that ſuffering friend of liberty.</p>
            <p>"Pennſylvania keeps no gallows," either, for <hi>ſedition</hi> or <hi>overdrawing at the Bank.</hi> Huzza! Huzza!</p>
            <p n="21">21. The combined fleets of France, Spain and Batavia.</p>

            <p n="25">25. Mr. Adet, late Miniſter of the French Republic.</p>
            <p>This toast alone would have characterized the feſtival. Citizen Adet has heaped inſult upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult on the government and on the whole coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and yet he was entitled to the applauſe of theſe people. Such applauſe, however, muſt be but a poor compenſation for the cold reception that the Citizen meets with every where elſe. It was a ſort of dumb peal to his departed rank. Since his ſelf-ſuſpenſion, his diplomatic ſuicide, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a mere carcaſs; a carcaſs that does ſtill walk about, 'tis true; but the miniſterial ſoul is fled, and perhaps, already animates ſome luckier mortal.—He is, or rather he was (poor man!) a member of the Philoſophical Society of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and, as ſuch, I make no doubt that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſt in ordinary is now preparing his funeral ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His having departed this life three months ago, is of no kind of conſequence with theſe phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, who always think that it is time enough to begin weeping for a deceaſed brother when his body is half devoured by the worms.</p>

            <p n="26">26. Thomas M'Kean, Chief Juſtice of Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>Reader, compariſons are odious you know, and therefore don't you go to aſk me what the people of Weſtminſter would have thought, if they had ſeen Lord Mansfield boozing and bawling in a public-houſe along with thirty or forty of the rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, headed by a foreign agent, at open enmity with the government. What ſuits very well in one country, does not ſuit at all in another; and therefore I beg you will not aſk me any ſuch ſneering queſtions as this.</p>
            <p>However, every one may ſpeak for himſelf, and I will ſay, that if ever I ſhould become a judge (of which I ſee no reaſon to deſpair), and ſhould ſo far forget the dignity of my ſtation as to become the companion of a herd of ſottiſh mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, may all the world that moment forget what is due to me. May my family diſown my ſway; may my own rib riſe up againſt my lawful authority; may ſhe be the curſedeſt ſhrew that ever wielded a broom-ſtick; may ſhe belabour me <hi>with the tongs,</hi> cut me <hi>over the eye,</hi> rib-roaſt me, till I am obliged <hi>to call in the neighbours</hi> to ſhelter me from the effects of her wrath.</p>
            <p>Mr. Langdon having retired.</p>
            <p n="27">27. John Langdon, an old <hi>whig.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Do you know what an <hi>old wig</hi> is, reader? It is a very ill-looking, naſty, deſpiſed and neglected thing, fit for nothing but to be trodden under foot, or thrown to the dunghil. Wigs, when new, are
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031946_0039_0FEF5C8D5A2B99A8"/>
paſſable; and, ſome years age, they were very faſhionable, and very uſeful too; but of late years, whether new or old, they have been found to be of no kind of utility, either in England or this country. The fact is, that the wigs, at laſt, thought themſelves heads, and from that moment, every man, who had too much ſpirit to be wig-rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, threw off the cumbrous companion.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now diſmiſs the <hi>toaſters,</hi> but not without remarking, what is well worth remarking, that, as <hi>Doctor Prieſtley</hi> aſſiſted at the Philadelphia com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of the French alliance, ſo <hi>Napper Tandy</hi> aſſiſted at the ſame commemoration at New-York, where the <hi>toaſts</hi> breathed just as much foul air againſt the Federal Government as thoſe of Philadelphia did. This would prove, if proof of the fact were yet wanted, that men of faction will ſtill be factious in whatever country and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whatever government they may live. Here is no eſtabliſhed hierarchy for Doctor Prieſtley to rail at, nor are there any <hi>tithes</hi> for him to wrangle for; and yet he cannot be quiet. Wherever the ſtandard of diſcontent is hoiſted, there the Doctor is a volunteer, ready armed and accoutred, whether it be in a conventicle or a club-room, whether the attack be to be made with ſcraps of ſcripture, mangled and profaned from the quiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lips of malice, or with blackguard toaſts roared forth from the lungs of gluttony and drunkenneſs.</p>
            <p>After this inſtance of hoſtility (as far as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted powers can lead him) againſt the General Government of America, I hope we ſhall hear no more of his peaceable diſpoſition, of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt us <q>to enjoy that toleration which
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031946_0040_0FEF5CA5857AB5C0"/>
his native land denied him," and of his wiſh to continue <hi>unmoleſted</hi> thoſe purſuits of various literature to which, without having ever enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into any <hi>political connections,</hi> his life has been devoted.</q> If he never before entered into <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical connections,</hi> he has done it now, at any rate. If his preſent <hi>intimacy,</hi> I ſay <hi>intimacy,</hi> with Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Adet; his toaſting ſuccess to the fleets of France, Spain, and Batavia, and the inſulting ſar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſms on the Federal Government, contained in the above liſt; if his herding along with all thoſe who hate, who oppoſe and who ſlander this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and whoſe only object is to overturn it, and render the country dependent on France; if this be not entering into <hi>political connections,</hi> I do not know what is.</p>
            <p>I hope alſo, that thoſe who were ſimple enough to believe the Doctor, when he profeſſed his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the royal government of his country, and ſolemnly declared that neither he nor his friends thought of, or wiſhed for, a revolution, will be convinced of his duplicity, when they hear him toaſting "The <hi>Republic</hi> of Great Britain," and wiſhing that the preſent year may witneſs the <hi>jubilee;</hi> the revolutionary jubilee, the jubilee of plunder and carnage, of incendiaries, thieves, philoſophers and cannibals.</p>
            <p>The conduct of this perſevering demagogue, and that of all thoſe who, like him, have fled from Britain to America, is the beſt juſtification that the ſtrong meaſures of Billy Pitt can have. While on the other ſide of the water, they only wanted a <hi>reform,</hi> a gentle reform; a very little would have done; a correction of abuſes or ſo. They only
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031946_0041_0FEF5CBC59E46B00"/>
wanted to <q>reſtore to the conſtitution its <hi>primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive purity,</hi> its ancient integrity and <hi>excellence.</hi> The tools of power had inſinuated that they wanted to <hi>pull down,</hi> when their only intention was to <hi>repair,</hi> the <hi>goodly fabric.</hi>
               </q> This was their plaintive cant while in England; but, once arrived in America, once removed from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of Botany Bay, the jail and the halter, they have no ſcruple to confeſs, nay they boaſt, that if <hi>tyranny</hi> had not diſappointed their projects, they would, e're this, have repaired <q>
                  <hi>the</hi> goodly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bric,</q> into a republic, and buried king George under the rubbiſh.</p>
            <p>Let this, then, be a warning to you, Engliſhmen (if ever theſe remarks ſhould fall into your hands): beware of the pit that theſe ſubtle fiends are preparing for you; be blind to their pauper exhibitions, and deaf to their crocodile cries. If you follow them but one ſtep, you are gone, you are engulphed for ever. Under your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whatever faults it may have (for none ever was without), your property and perſons are in ſafety; under the change that they would ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, neither would be of long exiſtence: firſt they would take your money and goods, and then, for fear of your revenge for the robbery, your lives. This is the ſure and certain progreſs in which they advance, and to this tend all their words and all their actions. We know them bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than you do. The ſight of the gibbet kept them in awe, impoſed a reſtraint on their tongues; we have ſeen their boſoms bare, and have had the diſcretion to profit from the diſcovery.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:031946_0042_0FEF5CBDE179EE58"/>When in Britain, they, like their apoſtle of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, Paine, held up our government to your imitation, and dunned your ears with the rare talents and virtues of our Chief; but now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! they ſlander both. Our government is but a copy of yours, and General Waſhington is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come an apoſtate, a hypocrite, a George Guelph. This <hi>"land of liberty,"</hi> (and which is truly ſuch, if ever there was a land of liberty in the world) This "land of liberty," to which they fled, as they pretended, from the <q>rude arm of lawleſs power,</q> is now become a den for ſlaves, <q>where the proud tyrant, ariſtocracy of wealth, lords it over the honeſt but indigent citizen.</q>— The ſame tone, the ſame language, the very ſame expreſſions, are now applied to this government, with which you were formerly amuſed, and, I am ſorry to ſay it, of which you had nearly been the dupes. If this does not rouze you from your credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, if this does not open your eyes, you deſerve to be plunged into all the horrors of revolution, into deſolation without bounds and miſeries without end.</p>
            <p>Recollect that this leſſon comes to you from the United States of America, from Philadelphia, the ſpot to which your deceivers reſorted in hopes of meeting men of their own minds. It is with pleaſure and with pride that I aſſure you, they were diſappointed. A tyrant crowd does not govern here, as they were taught, and as they taught you, to believe. To ſay that they have fallen into ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect would be too much, for they never were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed. Poverty, though rarely viſible here, is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally their lot. A thread-bare coat, a dirty ſhirt
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031946_0043_0FEF5C8FC8DDBAC8"/>
and a long beard are, with us, the diſtinctive marks of a <hi>Republican Briton.</hi> And theſe are the wretches, oh! credulous Engliſhmen! that were leading you about in crowds at their heels. Theſe were your oracles, the expoſitors of your laws and the defenders of your rights. Theſe ſcrofulous philoſophers, theſe political lepers, whom we ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en but to ſee, you were hugging to your boſoms.</p>
            <p>"Wiſdom is in age;" but, it ſeems, this maxim does not hold good with reſpect to nations. In the calendar of ſtates, America was born but yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday; yet ſhe has had the diſcernment to ſee through, and to fruſtrate, the deſigns of thoſe men, who have deſtroyed the faireſt part of Europe, and have ſhook the reſt to its very baſe. There they had to encounter adamantine inſtitutions grown ſtronger with time: here there ſeemed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to oppoſe them, the whole continent lay open to their demon-like aſſaults; yet have they been completely defeated by the peaceful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the national <hi>good ſenſe.</hi> In vain did they attempt to cajole us; in vain did they aſſume the language, and put on the garb, of liberty; it was ſoon perceived that their liberty and ours was not the ſame thing. <hi>Republicaniſm,</hi> was the next bait; but we alſo perceived that it was French and not American republicaniſm; we ſaw that as our ſtock could not be augmented, no good could come from a partnerſhip with them. In ſhort, (and let the emigrating demagogues hear it to their confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion), as we love order, ſo we deteſt its oppoſite, anarchy: as we love a free real republican go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, with power to protect and none to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs us, ſo we deteſt that mockery of a republic, a baſe, mob-like, pillaging, murderous democracy.</p>

                        <p>IF, in the general apprehenſion of an inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to retire, in that moſt eminent citizen, to whom all eyes had been directed and all hearts attracted, as the centre of our union for ſo long a period; the public opinion had exhibited any clear indications of another, in whom our fellow citizens could have generally united; as ſoon as I read that excellent addreſs which announced the neceſſity of deliberation in the choice of a Preſident, I ſhould have imitated the example of a character, with which I had co-operated, though in leſs conſpicuous and important ſtations, and maintained an uninterrupted friendſhip for two and twenty years. But as a number of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters appeared to ſtand in the general eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo nearly on a level, as to render it difficult to conjecture, on which the majority would fall; conſidering the relation in which I ſtood to the people of America, I thought it moſt reſpectful
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031946_0045_0FEF5C656CF965B0"/>
to them, and moſt conducive to the tranquillity of the public mind, to reſign myſelf with others, a ſilent ſpectator of the general deliberation, and a paſſive ſubject of public diſcuſſions.</p>
                        <p>Deeply penetrated with gratitude to my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen in general, for their long continued kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to me, and for that ſteady and affecting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, with which thoſe who have moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately known me, from early life, have on ſo many great occaſions entruſted to me, the care of their deareſt intereſts; ſince a majority of their electors, though a very ſmall one, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in my favour, and ſince, in a republican government, the majority, though ever ſo ſmall, muſt of neceſſity decide, I have determined at every hazard of a high but juſt reſponſibility, though with much anxiety and diffidence, once more to engage in their ſervice.—Their confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, which has been the chief conſolation of my life, is too precious and ſacred a depoſit ever to be conſidered lightly. As it has been found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only on the qualities of the heart, it never has been, it never can be, deceived, betrayed, or forfeited by me.</p>
                        <p>It is with reluctance, and with all theſe emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of gratitude and affection, which a long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of your goodneſs ought to inſpire, that I now retire from my ſeat in this houſe, and take my leave of the members of the Senate.</p>
                        <p>I ought not to declare, for the laſt time, your adjournment, before I have preſented to every ſenator preſent, and to every citizen who has ever been a ſenator of the United States, my
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031946_0046_0FEF5C92375F56B8"/>
thanks, for the candour and favour invariably re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from them all. It is a recollection, of which nothing can ever deprive me, and it will be a ſource of comfort to me, through the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of my life, that, as on the one hand, in a government conſtituted like ours, I have for eight years held the ſecond ſituation under the conſtitution of the United States, in perfect and uninterrupted harmony with the firſt, without envy in one, or jealouſy in the other: ſo, on the other hand, I have never had the ſmalleſt miſunderſtanding with any member of the ſenate. In all the abſtruſe queſtions, difficult conjunctures, dangerous emergencies, and animated debates upon the great intereſts of our country, which have ſo often and ſo deeply impreſſed all our minds, and intereſted the ſtrongeſt feelings of the heart, I have experienced an uniform polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reſpect from every quarter of the houſe. When queſtions of no leſs importance than diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, have produced a difference of ſentiment (and differences of opinion will always be found in free aſſemblies of men, and probably the greateſt diverſities upon the greateſt queſtions), when the ſenators have been equally divided, and my opinion has been demanded according to the conſtitution, I have conſtantly found, in that moiety of the ſenators, from whoſe judgment I have been obliged to diſſent, a diſpoſition to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low me the ſame freedom of deliberation and independence of judgment which they aſſerted for themſelves.</p>
                        <p>Within theſe walls, for a courſe of years, I have been an admiring witneſs of a ſucceſſion of information, eloquence, patriotiſm and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031946_0047_0FEF5C9D88EC4570"/>
which, as they would have done honour to any ſenate in any age, afford a conſolatory hope (if the legiſlatures of the ſtates are equally careful in their future ſelections, which there is no reaſon to diſtruſt) that no council more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent than this as a branch of the legiſlature will be neceſſary, to defend the rights, liberties, and properties of the people, and to protect the conſtitution of the United States, as well as the conſtitutions and rights of the individual ſtates, againſt errors of judgment, irregularities of the paſſions, or other encroachments of human in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity, or more reprehenſible enterprize, in the executive on one hand, or the more immediate repreſentatives of the people on the other.</p>
                        <p>Theſe conſiderations will all conſpire to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate me in my future courſe, with a confident reliance, that as far as my conduct ſhall be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly meaſured by the conſtitution of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, and faithfully directed to the public good, I ſhall be ſupported by the ſenate, as well as by the houſe of repreſentatives and the people at large; and on no other conditions ought any ſupport at all to be expected or deſired.</p>

                           <salute>SIR,</salute>

                        <p>The Senate of the United States would be unjuſt to their own feelings, and deficient in the performance of a duty their relation to the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their country impoſes, ſhould they fail to expreſs their regard for your perſon, and their reſpect for your character, in anſwer to the addreſs you preſented to them, on your leaving a ſtation which you have ſo long and ſo honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably filled as their Preſident.</p>
                        <p>The motives you have been pleaſed to diſcloſe which induced you not to withdraw from the public ſervice, at a time when your experience, talents, and virtues, were peculiarly deſirable, are as honourable for yourſelf, as from our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in you, Sir, we truſt the reſult will be beneficial to our beloved country.</p>
                        <p>When you retired from your dignified ſeat in this houſe, and took your leave of the members of the Senate, we felt all thoſe emotions of gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and affection, which our knowledge and experience of your abilities, and undeviating im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality ought to inſpire; and we ſhould with painful reluctance endure the ſeparation, but for the conſoling reflection, that the ſame qualities
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031946_0049_0FEF5CABE47FB830"/>
which have rendered you uſeful, as the Preſident of this branch of the legiſlature, will enable you to be ſtill more ſo, in the exalted ſtation to which you have been called.</p>
                        <p>From you, Sir, in whom your country have, for a long period, placed a ſteady confidence, which has never been betrayed or forfeited, and to whom they have on ſo many occaſions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted the care of their deareſt intereſts, which have never been abuſed.—From you, who hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſecond ſituation under the Conſtitution of the United States, have lived in uninterrupted harmony with him who has held the firſt.</p>
                        <p>From you we receive with much ſatisfaction, the declaration which you are pleaſed to make of the opinion you entertain of the character of the preſent ſenators, and of that of thoſe citizens who have been heretofore ſenators. This declaration, were other motives wanting, would afford them an incentive to a virtuous perſeverance, in that line of conduct which has been honoured with your approbation.</p>
                        <p>In your future courſe, we entertain no doubt, that your official conduct, will be meaſured by the conſtitution, and directed to the public good, you have therefore a right to entertain a confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reliance, that you will be ſupported, as well by the people at large as by their conſtituted au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.</p>
                        <p>We cordially reciprocate the wiſhes which you expreſs for our honour, health, and happineſs: we join with yours, our fervent prayers for the

continuation of the virtues and liberties of our fellow-citizens; for the public proſperity and peace; and for you we implore the beſt reward of virtuous deeds, the grateful approbation of your conſtituents, and the ſmiles of heaven.</p>
