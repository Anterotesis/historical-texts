            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>THE solemn Consideration of those awful threatnings that are in the face of divine Providence, both toward the world in general, in respect of that fearful Sight and Sign from Heaven, which hath of late been taken notice of; and towards our selves more particularly, for that the Lord hath this last year manifested his holy displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure against us, having by an unusual Flood, by the Blast, and by worms, which his own own hand (who is able by the most contemptible of his creatures to stain our glory) hath sent among us, diminished the fruits of the earth. Having also dilivered some of our New-England Vessels with those in them, into the hands of such as are enemies to the Christian Name, and more lately frowned upon <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Shipwracks, and considerable losses at Sea; and visited some amongst us by sudden and unexpected Deaths. Being also sensible, that there are in other respects, dark clouds impending over us. And that the present state of the Protestant interest abroad, and more especially in the land of our Fathers Sepulchres, doth call for earnest Prayer before that God unto whom salvation belongeth. The Consideration of all these things calling aloud upon us for more then ordinary seekings of the Face of God in Jesus Christ:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Court doth therefore appoint the 21<hi>st.</hi> day of <hi>April</hi> next to be observed as a Day of Fasting and Prayer, hereby prohibiting all servile labour upon that day, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting all the Ministers, Churches and People throughout this Colony, religiously to observe the same; and to intreat that the favour of God through Jesus Christ may be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his People in other parts of the world. And that if it may stand with his good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, we may be hid in the day of the Lords anger, our publick Peace, Health, Libertyes stil continued. That Seed time and Harvest may not sail. And that a good success may be to the endeavours of this Court, and particularly for our worthy Agents in their nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation. And to pray unto him, that he would order a perfect Lot for us, with respect unto those that are in the approaching Election, to be chosen as Rulers over this his People.</p>
