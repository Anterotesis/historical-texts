            <title>A Fish caught in his own net. An examination of nine sermons, from Matt. 16. 18. published last year, by Mr Joseph Fish of Stonington; wherein he labours to prove, that those called standing churches in New-England, are built upon the rock, and upon the same principles with the first fathers of this country: and that Separates and Baptists are joining with the gates of hell against them. : In answer to which; many of his mistakes are corrected; the constitution of those churches opened; the testimonies of prophets and apostles, and also of many of those fathers are produced, which as plainly condemn his plan, as any Separate or Baptist can do. / By Isaac Backus.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>PEACE is ſo lovely in itſelf, and is ſo eſſential to happineſs, that all would be accounted friends there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The direction from above is, <hi>ſeek peace and purſue it:</hi> and the cry from below is <hi>peace, peace!</hi> Yet there is a great and important difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two languages; for the divine voice is, <hi>love the TRUTH and peace;</hi> and the way preſcribed to promote <hi>union</hi> is, <hi>ſpeaking the TRUTH in love. Zech. 8.19. Eph. 4.15.</hi> But the two grand engines to ſupport the contrary cauſe are <hi>deceit</hi> and <hi>violence.</hi> Which cauſe the Prince of <hi>peace</hi> came into the world on purpoſe to deſtroy; and wherever his <hi>truth</hi> prevails, it breaks up that ſort of <hi>peace.</hi> Hence the charge exhibited againſt one of his greateſt miniſters, by men of principal note in the world for religion and order, was, <hi>We have found this man a peſtilent fellow, and a mover of ſedition throughout the world. Acts 24.5.</hi> And it was not only ſo among the <hi>Jews,</hi> but alſo in the capital of a <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man colony;</hi> when the power of truth had cut off the hope of an unlawful ſcheme of <hi>gain,</hi> the <hi>magiſtrates</hi> ſoon had a complaint laid before them, that, <hi>theſe men do exceedingly trouble our city. Acts 16.20.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, this conduct both in <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> is ſo plainly expoſed in the bible, that the whole <hi>chriſtian world</hi> will condemn it; and who will dare to appear now to plead for a <hi>peace</hi> contrary to <hi>truth?</hi> Inſtead of that, <hi>truth</hi> is ſet upon as high a pole among <hi>proteſtants,</hi> as the <hi>croſs</hi> is among the <hi>papiſts</hi>: and every author that writes, has got the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant <hi>word</hi> wrote in ſome place, where the reader may not fail to ſee it. Yet the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> has been ſuch <hi>galling of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> in <hi>perverſe diſputed</hi> and <hi>ſtriving</hi> about this and other <hi>words</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 6.4, 5.</note> in our day, that ſome ſerious people are ready to condemn all <hi>diſputing,</hi> at being a principal cauſe of all the confuſions that appear in our nation and land. Tho' if after the confuſed noiſe, and garments rolled in blood, with the great perplexities which were produced by many <hi>defeats</hi> that we met with in the beginning of the late war, any had ſaid,
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010823_0003_0F81D4693207F3F0"/>
we had better be <hi>eaſy</hi> as long as we can, than to oppoſe the enemy any more; ſuch advice would hardly have paſſed for good policy, or for a token of true regard to our peace and welfare.</p>
            <p>All rational attempts to remove calamities, are levelled againſt the cauſes of them; and as deceit and violence have been the cauſes of all our woes from the beginning, ſo a great part of the work of God's ſervants in all ages has been to point out and expoſe the deceits of falſe men; which has often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced what the prophet ſpeaks of, viz. <hi>A voice of the how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the ſhepherds;</hi> and ſays he, <hi>my ſoul loathed them, and their ſoul alſo abhorred me. Zech. 11.3, 8.</hi> And things of like nature have appeared in our times, but none are willing to be accounted the <hi>idol ſhepherds</hi>; each one would turn it off to others; and many miniſters in our land have been labouring theſe <hi>20</hi> years to fix the odious character upon a number of people who have withdrawn from their ſocieties. Among whom Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> has lately diſtinguiſhed himſelf, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to open the
<q>
                  <hi>riſe, cauſe and tendency</hi> of theſe ſeparations and the errors of the anabaptiſts,</q>
in a volume of about <hi>200</hi> pages. This I have been requeſted by chriſtian friends to write ſome reply to; but as I have ſeveral times, expoſed ſome of my thoughts on theſe ſubjects, to the world. I repeatedly told my friends that I thought I had done my part in that way. At length it was urged that many of the firſt leaders in ſeparation were gone off the ſtage, and ſcarce any left that are ſo fully acquainted with the circumſtances and manner of the firſt ſeparations, as I have been. This argument prevailed ſo far, that I agreed to take and read the book and act as light might appear. And when I came to read it, no doubt remained whether it ought to be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not, tho' the doing of it was far from appearing a pleaſing lot to nature. For whatever pleaſure it may yield, to appear to the public in matters that are pleaſing, or for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſement; yet in <hi>war,</hi> to be diſtinguiſhed as a mark for every one to ſhoot at, <hi>that</hi> nature dreads. My unequalneſs to the taſk was ſtill a greater difficulty; for tho' it was an eaſy matter to point out many of Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi>'s miſtakes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtences, ſo as to render his performance contemptible; to do the ſubject juſtice, would be nothing leſs than to lay open the religious <hi>conſtitutions</hi> of the whole country, and many <hi>tranſactions</hi> which deeply affect the characters of many noted men.</p>
            <p>Yet to omit it now, could not be done with a clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; for Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays,
<q>If I have in any inſtance, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:010823_0003_0F81D4693207F3F0"/>
                  <hi>facts,</hi> or miſrepreſented <hi>perſons</hi> or <hi>things,</hi> I deſire it may be corrected.</q>
Preface p. <hi>4.</hi> And after a long diſcourſe on thoſe things, he ſays,
<q>The foregoing <hi>errors, principles,</hi> and groundleſs <hi>offences</hi> which they took, the charge of all which muſt lie upon them until they purge themſelves.</q>
p. <hi>164.</hi> Therefore to be ſilent now, would be a letting many things paſs for truth, which I knew were not ſo, tho' many others did not know it. Mr. <hi>F.</hi> tells us he hopes, if there are any <hi>miſtakes,</hi>
               <q>it will be looked upon as ſimple and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.</q>
To which I would ſay, I deſire always to avoid the evil of judging the <hi>counſels</hi> of others <hi>hearts,</hi> and to judge righteouſly according to what is made manifeſt. But as he has manifeſted that he has <hi>miſtook</hi> the <hi>rule itſelf,</hi> throughout his book, I leave him and others to conſider how <hi>ſimple</hi> or <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſigned</hi> ſuch a <hi>miſtake</hi> can be; or what leſs can be expected than falſe actings upon a falſe rule. Three witneſſes are allowed to prove any point, both by divine and human law: and that number ſhall ſuffice for the preſent to prove that he has miſtook, and acted contrary to the <hi>golden rule</hi> in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair before us.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> No man, or community can think it reaſonable to have their character drawn only by their <hi>imperfections</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any of their <hi>vertues:</hi> yet Mr. <hi>F.</hi> after a long attempt to draw the ſeparates "picture to the life," ſays,
<q>Whatever <hi>good things</hi> they have among them, they have them not <hi>as ſeparates,</hi> but in <hi>common</hi> with other chriſtians. The things that I have told you of above, are their <hi>characteriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.</hi>
               </q>
p. <hi>160.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> None can be willing to have the character of their whole denomination taken from evil perſons and things which may be pickt out among them: yet in the midſt of this labour to draw our picture, he ſays,
<q>I would not here be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to repreſent them <hi>all</hi> to a man, as advancing and <hi>uniting</hi> in every <hi>one</hi> of the particulars above-mentioned; but <hi>ſome</hi> of them held <hi>one,</hi> ſome <hi>another.</hi>
               </q>
p. <hi>142.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> No man can rationally be willing to be deprived of the liberty of hearing and judging for himſelf in important matters; nor to be condemned by others without a fair hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet this is the very labour of Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi>'s whole book; for a principal reaſon given for his writing it, in the firſt page of his preface is, that
<q>a conſiderable number, if not the greater part of his few remaining people, inadvertently fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the ſeparate teachers, <hi>ſo far</hi> as to frequent their meetings.</q>
And a ſpecial article of advice, in the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> is
<q>
                  <hi>Go not after them nor follow them.</hi>—How
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:010823_0004_0F81D469F485F7F8"/>
can you, with any good conſcience, after I have ſhewn you from <hi>whence</hi> they aroſe, their <hi>principle, ſpirit</hi> and <hi>ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.</hi>
               </q>
p. <hi>191.</hi> Thus his whole drift appears to be to keep his people from hearing and judging for themſelves. And he has condemned us without a fair hearing: for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of our principles and practices have been publiſhed by various hands, and at different times for theſe <hi>18</hi> years; yet it does not appear thro' his whole book, that he has paid any regard to them, even ſo much as to point out our miſtakes or inconſiſtencies, (as doubtleſs he might have found ſome ſuch;) but the chief of what he has held forth to the world againſt us, is upon his own bare word.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe the chief thing which blinded him in theſe affairs, was a conceit of his <hi>good deſign</hi> therein; for ſpeaking of "the grievous things" which he has written both againſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parates and baptiſts, he ſays,
<q>Neither of which ſhould I have meddled with, could I at this day, have ſeen how to plead the cauſe of the <hi>churches</hi> (that our brethren have ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from) which I believe to be the cauſe of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhewing the <hi>younger</hi> and reminding the <hi>elder</hi> among my people, how and wherein <hi>this ſacred cauſe</hi> has been injured.</q>
Pref. p. <hi>4.</hi> Now 'tis no new thing for men under a ſtrong conceit that they are engaged in a <hi>good cauſe</hi> to put <hi>good</hi> meanings to <hi>bad</hi> actions of their own, and <hi>bad</hi> meanings to <hi>good</hi> actions of others; yea and to eſteem men's <hi>works</hi> for the <hi>perſons</hi> ſake, inſtead of eſteeming the <hi>perſon</hi> highly for his <hi>work's</hi> ſake. And this temper will prompt men to think that <hi>evil</hi> don't belong to the <hi>ſacred cauſe</hi> that they are in, and that <hi>good</hi> don't belong to the oppoſite party, but are intruders on each hand; and they would attribute the <hi>evil</hi> among themſelves to others, and the good among others to themſelves. And is it not from hence that our author, when he is going to reckon up a catalogue of the <hi>evil</hi> of the times, ſays,
<q>If the ſeparates are not the <hi>only</hi> guilty perſons, or not <hi>MORE</hi> guilty than <hi>ſome</hi> that <hi>pretend</hi> to be of the <hi>ſtanding order,</hi> yet 'tis manifeſt that the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders are owing <hi>chiefly</hi> if not <hi>entirely</hi> to the <hi>SEPARA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIONS</hi>?</q>

<q>I know not of one <hi>principle</hi> or <hi>practice,</hi> among them that is agreeable to the goſpel, but what they learned in <hi>our churches.</hi>

Whereas to have told the plain truth, he muſt have informed his honorable audience, that the reaſon why they had done ſo little to chriſtanize the <hi>Indians,</hi> was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had ſpent almoſt all their labours among the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,</hi> and in the moſt <hi>wealthy</hi> places that they could get footing in. And if he could have ſtooped ſo low as to have looked into the life of Mr. <hi>John Eliot</hi> in the laſt century, and the life of Mr. <hi>David Brainerd</hi> in this, he would have found, (that inſtead of a <hi>new diſcovery</hi>) the very <hi>maxim</hi> he ſpeaks of was known and acted upon, both in the paſt and preſent age, by the moſt zealous and moſt ſucceſsful labourers to bring the <hi>Indians</hi> to true chriſtianity, that <hi>America</hi> ever ſaw.</p>
            <p>The biſhop proceeds to charge the <hi>coloniſts</hi> with the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful crime of yearly <hi>ſtealing ſlaves</hi> from the oppoſite continent, and <hi>ſacrificing</hi> of them

            </p>
            <p>Here is a glaſs for Mr. <hi>F.</hi> to look into. A profeſſed miniſter of Chriſt, at the head of a ſociety, compoſed of the chief <hi>dignitaries of the church,</hi> and of ſeveral lords in the <hi>ſtate,</hi> after exclaiming againſt perſecution, <hi>charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſeth</hi> the <hi>coloniſts</hi> as <hi>fanaticks, factious gentiles,</hi> yearly practiſing the worſt of <hi>heatheniſm,</hi> even the <hi>ſacrificing</hi> of <hi>human</hi> creatures to an <hi>idol;</hi> and this from the ſame truth that tells of <hi>pious deſigns</hi> in <hi>all</hi> the proceedings of his <hi>own party,</hi> and that charges it as <hi>impiety,</hi> even to <hi>ſuſpect</hi> their <hi>perſeverance</hi> therein! <note n="*" place="bottom">And all this to move people to contribute money to that Society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet church-men have as great a hand in the ſlave-trade as any.</note> 
               <hi>But thinkeſt thou, O man, that judgeſt them that do ſuch things, and doſt the ſame, that thou ſhalt eſcape the judgment of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps ſome are ready to cry, Who is this, that preſumes to correct biſhops and miniſters at ſuch a rate? Anſwer, he is a perſon of very little note in the learned world, and never was a member of their ſchools. Indeed they have given him a few titles; as ſometimes he has been of a <hi>credible family,</hi> and ſo it was wondered at that he would go with ſuch a deſpicable people; yet anon he was pronounced a <hi>young upſtart,</hi> not to be regarded. One ſentence decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to be a <hi>crafty deceiver</hi>; the next an <hi>honeſt gump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.</hi> Sometimes 'twas aſſerted that he was purſuing <hi>worldly gain;</hi> and at another time they declared that he had little or nothing for his labour, and ſpent his own eſtate: but <hi>neither ſo did their witneſs agree together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The truth is, what little he does know, was gained in the ſchool which Dr. <hi>Franck</hi> ſpeaks of, where the higheſt wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is, to <hi>know Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified;</hi> and wherein things are taught in an <hi>experimental</hi> way. Hence the reader will find ſeveral leſſons in the enſuing pages, repeated in that manner: and tho' he is not inſenſible that <hi>telling of experience,</hi> is treated with contempt by the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able chriſtians of our day, yet he is not daunted at their ſneers, while he ſees the chief apoſtle of the <hi>circumciſion</hi> taking this method to ſatisfy his brethren; and the great apoſtle of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> doing the ſame before his learned perſecutors, when they were complained of, for leaving the <hi>cuſtoms of their fathers,</hi> Acts <hi>11.4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—18.</hi> &amp; <hi>22.1—21.</hi> One ſpecial order of that ſchool is,
<q>Have no fellowſhip with the unfruitful <hi>works of darkneſs,</hi> but rather <hi>reprove them.</hi> But all things that are <hi>reproved,</hi>
                  <pb n="x" facs="unknown:010823_0006_0F81D46BD78623F8"/>
are made <hi>manifeſt</hi> by the <hi>light.</hi>
               </q>
This he takes to be a ſufficient warrant for improving a fair opportunity to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to hold up light to his fellow men, and to labour to convince all he can, be they ever ſo much above him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they have miſtook darkneſs for light; and he expects the ſame from others.</p>
            <p>He would be far from repreſenting Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> as <hi>ſingular</hi> in what he has now publiſhed. No, his ſermons are a proper <hi>ſpecimen</hi> of what has often been delivered from pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits in our land, for more than <hi>20</hi> years; and being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded that many worthy men, both in public and private ſtations, have not known the true ſtate of theſe affairs, therefore the author was induced to enlarge more upon them, than his love of brevity would otherwiſe have permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And may we all ſo ſpeak and ſo hear and do, as they that ſhall be judged by the law of liberty.</p>

            <head>The Introduction. Containing ſome brief Remarks upon the <hi>Characters</hi> which Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> gives of a Church of Chriſt.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOSE who deſire to bring any controverſy to a juſt iſſue, will endeavor to hold up what light they can, concerning the merits of the cauſe, and not amuſe or perplex others minds with things foreign from the things in hand: therefore, as Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> begins his preface with this informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that
<q>The ſpecial occaſion of the following diſcourſes was, the revival of the ſpirit and principles of <hi>ſeparation</hi> and <hi>anababtiſm</hi>;</q>
I ſhall endeavor, according to the light I may be favoured with, to attend cloſely to theſe points, and ſhew wherein the difference between us lies, and the grounds of that difference.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I heartily concur with him that the <hi>truth</hi> which <hi>Peter</hi> confeſſed, or the perſon of Chriſt, of whom this confeſſion is made, <hi>is the rock,</hi> upon which Jeſus Chriſt reſolves to build his church;</q>
and that <hi>Peter</hi> was
<q>one of thoſe <hi>lively ſtones,</hi> or precious materials of that building.</q>
page 3. But I can't ſay ſo of ſome of the <hi>characters</hi> which he gives to deſcribe the church of Chriſt by; the firſt of which is,</p>
            <p>
               <q>That Jeſus Chriſt has but one church in the world, and that it is the <hi>ſame which it always was.</hi>
               </q>
To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain which he ſays,
<q>We gentile believers were graffed in among the Jewiſh believers, making one church. As the apoſtle Paul ſhews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. And the whole is but the continuation of the ſame church, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world.</q>
p. 6.7. It is readily granted that the <hi>inviſible</hi> church is always the ſame; but that is not what Mr. F. intends: for he has juſt before ſaid,
<q>I mean to ſpeak of Chriſt's <hi>viſible Church</hi> upon earth.— which contains both good and bad, true believers and nominal.</q>
And his <hi>ſixth charctter</hi> of the church is only an explanation of this: which is, that
<q>The church of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010823_0007_0F81D46C29DD1A20"/>
Chriſt has always conſiſted of viſible believing parents and their children bound together by covenant to be the Lords.</q>
p. 22. And after ſome diſcourſe upon <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham's</hi> covenant he ſays,
<q>Hence it appears that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parents cannot enter into <hi>that</hi> covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> without taking their children with them.—They therefore that take God for their God, but not the God of their ſeed, <hi>equally ſo</hi>; they leave out <hi>half,</hi> or the <hi>greater part</hi> of the ſubjects of it.</q>
p. 24, 25. He adds
<q>If any ſay that this promiſe <hi>To thee and thy ſeed after thee,</hi> under the goſpel, intends thy <hi>ſeed</hi> or <hi>children</hi> when they are grown up, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>actual believers</hi>; and not while they are in a ſtate of infancy, I apprehend the expoſition will not ſtand.</q>
And after citing <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.10, &amp;c. he ſays,
<q>Here you ſee, that great and ſmall, parents and children, even little ones, ſtand forth in a body, that they might all enter into (or renew) covenant with their God.—Which ſhows that <hi>children,</hi> even <hi>infants</hi> were always reckoned a part of that <hi>body</hi> or <hi>church,</hi> which the Lord gathered in Abraham's family.</q>
p. 25, 26.</p>
            <p>Tis true that this was the conſtitution of the church which was gathered in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s family, as appears from verſe 13 which is, <hi>That he may eſtabliſh thee to day for a people unto himſelf, and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath ſaid unto thee, and as he hath ſworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Iſaac, and to Jacob.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> ſays,
<q>Is it not altogether reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuppoſe that the chriſtian church is made up of the ſame materials that the jewiſh church was?</q>
The anſwer muſt be No, by no means; becauſe God has ſaid the contrary; and 'tis perfect madneſs to ſet up our <hi>ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions</hi> and <hi>reaſonings</hi> againſt divine revelation. Now that God has ſaid the contrary, appears from <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.31, 32. Where he ſays,
<q>Behold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will make a <hi>new covenant</hi> with the houſe of <hi>Iſrael; not according to the covenant</hi> that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
               </q>
Thoſe who ſtood forth then as a body to enter into covenant, tho' they had ſeen great ſigns and miracles; yet the Lord had not given them an <hi>heart to perceive, eyes to ſee,</hi> nor <hi>ears to hear,</hi> unto that day. But of this new covenant he ſays,
<q>I will put my law in their <hi>inward parts,</hi> and write it in <hi>their hearts,</hi> and I <hi>will</hi> be their God, and they <hi>ſhall</hi> be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010823_0007_0F81D46C29DD1A20"/>
my people; and they ſhall <hi>all know me</hi> from the <hi>leaſt</hi> of them unto the <hi>greateſt</hi> of them, ſaith the Lord.</q>
The conſtitution, prieſthood and ordinances of the jewiſh church, ſerved unto the <hi>example</hi> and <hi>ſhadow</hi> of heavenly things; but this is a <hi>better</hi> covenant which is eſtabliſhed upon <hi>better promiſes.</hi> That <hi>old</hi> covenant Iſrael <hi>brake,</hi> and he <hi>regarded them not</hi>: But this <hi>new</hi> covenant is eſtabliſhed upon better promiſes, which are, <hi>I will,</hi> and <hi>they ſhall. Heb.</hi> 8.5—13.</p>
            <p>I cannot imagine that 'tis poſſible for words to expreſs more plainly than theſe do, that there is an eſſential diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the <hi>materials,</hi> as well as the <hi>forms</hi> of the two churches; even the ſame that there is between ſhadow and ſubſtance, fleſh and ſpirit, type and antitype. All <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>natural</hi> ſeed were circumciſed, and God ſaid, <hi>my covenant ſhall be in your fleſh</hi>; and all his ſeed in a <hi>goſpel</hi> ſenſe have the law written in their <hi>hearts,</hi> and their <hi>ſins</hi> ſhall be <hi>remembered no more.</hi> Heb. 10.16, 17. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly it was ſuch as <hi>gladly received the word,</hi> and <hi>ſuch as ſhould be ſaved,</hi> that were <hi>added to the church,</hi> in the apoſtles times, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. And when ſome of a contrary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter got in, they are ſaid to <hi>creep in unawares,</hi> Gal. 2.4. Jude 4. Therefore I think we may juſtly return our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's queſtion, and ſay,
<q>Is it not altogether <hi>unreaſonable</hi> to ſuppoſe that the chriſtian church is made up of the ſame materials the jewiſh church was, ſince the holy Ghoſt has ſo plainly declared the contrary?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Having given a few of my thoughts upon Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi>'s <hi>firſt</hi> mark of a true church; and alſo of his <hi>ſixth</hi> which explained it, I come to his <hi>ſecond,</hi> which is, that the churches "Foundation is one, and ever the ſame." p. 7. This is ſtrictly true of the inviſible church, but the leaders of the viſible church when Jeſus came, where <hi>builders</hi> who ſet at nought this glorious <hi>corner-ſtone</hi>; and he ſhews that none build on the <hi>Rock</hi> but ſuch as <hi>hear his ſayings and do them,</hi> Mat. 7.24. Faith cometh by hearing: and thoſe who hear and believe with their <hi>hearts,</hi> ought to confeſs with their <hi>mouths,</hi> and obey all Chriſt's commands, and thus they are <hi>built up for an habitation of God thro' the Spirit.</hi> In this ſenſe I would join with him.</p>
            <p>His <hi>third</hi> mark is, that
<q>Chriſt Jeſus was always the head and king of his church.</q>
p. 9. So he is: and I heartily concur with him that our Lord Jeſus
<q>has done enough to make us tremble at the thoughts of attempting any

thing, in his houſe and worſhip, which he has not directed us to do, much more any thing that he has forbidden.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Our authors fourth character is,
<q>Chriſt's church has always been furniſhed with officers of his appointing.</q>
p. 11. Here again we agree in general truths; but when he comes to trace the order down from the beginning, why was his memory ſo ſhort as never to mention the <hi>prophets</hi> in the jewiſh church, while he enlarges upon the caſe of the <hi>prieſts</hi> and <hi>Levites</hi>? Perhaps he might think the latter would beſt agree with his notion of a <hi>line</hi> of <hi>ſucceſſion</hi>; but he may find himſelf miſtaken there. For after the return of the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſome of the children of the <hi>prieſts,</hi> ſought their <hi>regiſter</hi> among thoſe that were reckoned by <hi>genealogy,</hi> but they were not found: therefore they were, as <hi>polluted, put from the prieſthood.</hi> Ezra 2.62. Now if the power of ordination is not in the <hi>church,</hi> but is <hi>wholly</hi> committed to the <hi>miniſters</hi> of the churches, as Mr. <hi>F.</hi> expreſly holds (p. 80.145.) then, according to this plain example, every miniſter who can't produce the <hi>regiſter</hi> of his ordination, as being derived in an <hi>uninterrupted line</hi> down from the apoſtles, he ought as <hi>polluted</hi> to be <hi>put from the</hi> miniſtry. And where will he and his brethren be then?</p>
            <p>Indeed he would have us think that they have ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter where the very <hi>names</hi> of ſuch a line is preſerved. p. 18. But it ſeems by the margin that 'tis in <hi>Latin,</hi> and as we are come out of the <hi>Latin</hi> church, we ſhall expect to hear it in <hi>Engliſh</hi> before we believe it. <hi>Paul's charge</hi> is not to give heed to <hi>fables and endleſs genealogies,</hi> which miniſter <hi>queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,</hi> rather than <hi>godly edifying.</hi> 1 Tim. 1.4. And how fully have theſe words been verified in the diſputes which <hi>catholics, prelates,</hi> and <hi>preſbyters</hi> have had upon this affair theſe many hundred years? and it ſtill miniſters <hi>queſtion</hi> which are as much unreſolved, as when they began the diſpute.</p>
            <p>Our author's <hi>fifth</hi> character is, that
<q>The church of Chriſt is a confederate people, a people in viſible covenant with God and with one another,</q>
p. 19. This is true, and ſo is his <hi>ſeventh,</hi> that 'tis
<q>further known by ſpecial ordinances which God hath given it,</q>
p. 34. Tho' it ought to be remembred that the falſe church hath covenants and ordinances as well as the true, only the true church endeavours to keep to the divine pattern; while the falſe, adds inventions of her own. Theſe are therefore by no means ſo plain marks to diſtinguiſh the true church as his <hi>eighth</hi> and laſt is; viz. that
<q>Chriſt's church has always had,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:010823_0008_0F81D46D1C4DAE88"/>
and always will have his holy ſpirit dwelling in it.</q>
p. 44. This is a great truth; for if one church as well as perſon, have not the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt,</hi> it is <hi>none of his.</hi> Thus I have given a little touch upon the <hi>characteriſtics</hi> which Mr. F. has given of the church: two of them I think are not true, in the others we agree in general, tho' when we come to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply them the difference between us will more diſtinctly open in many particulars.</p>

            <head>Part. I. The <hi>conſtitution</hi> which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> pleads for, opened, and proved to be eſſentially different from the firſt churches in this Country.</head>
            <p>When Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> comes to apply theſe characters, he, to prepare the way promiſeth ſeveral things, the ſubſtance of which are, That the rule is perfect, but the beſt of men are imperfect, ſo that when they come with honeſt hearts to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply divine rules, they differ ſo widely in their opinions upon ſome modes of worſhip, as to render it difficult, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable for them to worſhip harmoniouſly together: which ſhews the neceſſity as well as grounds of mutal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, and ſhould make us cautious how we give hard names. Theſe are weighty conſiderations, and if they had continued with due weight upon his mind thro' his follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcourſes, it would doubtleſs have prevented my troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him in the affair; but ſince it has proved to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, I will <hi>alſo give mine opinion</hi>; and then leave it with the reader to judge for himſelf.</p>
            <p>Our author firſt applies his rules to thoſe which he calls <hi>ſtanding churches,</hi> and he ſays,
<q>We have ſufficient reaſon to be comfortably ſatisfied that theſe churches are true churches of Jeſus Chriſt.</q>
p. 78. As to their <hi>conſtitution,</hi> he ſays,
<q>They are in general of the <hi>congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gational</hi> way; and altho' in many parts, particularly in this <note n="*" place="bottom">Connecticut.</note> colony, they are for mutual benefit, <hi>conſociated</hi> or united together by agreement, yet they remain <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational,</hi> p. 79.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This title, as I underſtand, is derived from the fathers of this country, therefore we muſt look there for its true meaning. Now <hi>Cambridge platform</hi> ſays, the church ſince the coming of Chriſt is
<q>only congregational, therefore neither national, provincial nor claſſical.</q>
National churches have their pariſhes, for managing the common affairs of their worſhip, who yet are under the government of the whole: But the plan before us in expreſs diſtinction therefrom, has the whole power of church goverment in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:010823_0009_0F81D46DA85DB998"/>
each particular church,
<q>power to open and ſhut, to chuſe and refuſe, to conſtitute in office, and remove from office.</q>
This is the expreſs meaning of the name, as it is explained by our fathers who gave it: And tho' they freely improved the advice and aſſiſtance of other chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, yet it was <hi>ſiſters</hi> or <hi>equals,</hi> who ſtill had the whole right of government within each church.</p>
            <p>And are the ſtanding churches ſuch? No, Mr. <hi>F.</hi> has not got two pages forward, before he lays down this as the firſt thing which <hi>ought</hi> to be <hi>corrected</hi> in the churches, viz.
<q>The impoſition of hands at the ordaining of elders, which, ſays he, I apprehend the goſpel has committed <hi>wholly</hi> to the care of the <hi>preſbytery,</hi> or <hi>miniſters</hi> of the churches; but is by the indulgent <hi>Cambridge</hi> platform, diſpoſed of to the <hi>brethren,</hi> at the pleaſure of the church.</q>
p. 80. Thus while he uſurps the name, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis credible, he denies a principal point in its meaning, and directly ſets up a power above the churches; for, if the power of ordination is not <hi>in</hi> the church, then ſhe muſt be beholden to a power <hi>without</hi> her, and ſo <hi>above</hi> her, to give her office-authority. But our fathers had ſeen too much of this ſpiritual tyranny, to be willing to come under it again; and as they knew that the <hi>church of the living God,</hi> is <hi>the pillar and ground of the truth,</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 3.15. John 3.9, 10.</note> they reſted the matter there, and deſired with <hi>Timothy</hi> to behave as they ought, <hi>in the houſe of God</hi>; but not like <hi>Diotrephes</hi> to love a <hi>pre-eminence over it.</hi> However Mr. <hi>F.</hi> would have it that their <hi>practice</hi> was not agreable to their <hi>principles,</hi> and ſays <hi>Plymouth</hi> church "attempted not to ordain a miniſter merely as a church," of brethren only, with their own hands." p. 84. But Mr. <hi>Prince</hi> who knew as well as he, informs us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the firſt church in <hi>Salem,</hi> that on <hi>Aug.</hi> 6. 1629.
<q>They proceeded to <hi>ordain their</hi> miniſters; as alſo Mr. <hi>Houghton</hi> a ruling elder; being ſeparated to their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral offices by the impoſition of the hands of ſome of the <hi>brethren</hi> appointed by the church thereto: Governor <hi>Bradford</hi> and others, as <hi>meſſengers</hi> from the church of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> being by croſs winds hindred from being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in the former part of the ſervice, came time enough to give them the <hi>right hand of fellowſhip.</hi>

<q>to conſtitute in office, &amp; remove from office, are acts belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſame power,</q>
therefore, as they were put <hi>out</hi> of office, by the <hi>ſame power</hi> that put them <hi>in,</hi> they were now or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained anew. The like was done to Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> the firſt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Boſton.</hi> Indeed a late honorable hiſtorian tells us, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him, that
<q>all joined in a proteſtation that it was not a renouncing of the miniſtry he received in <hi>England,</hi> but that it was a confirmation, in conſequence of their election.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>'s hiſtory of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> vol. I. p. 419.</note> Upon which I would deſire leave to obſerve, that none could have reaſon to think that they renounced his right to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove his miniſterial <hi>gift</hi>; but tis plain that they judged <hi>this ordination</hi> to be needful to put him into the <hi>office</hi> here. And the ſame author informs us in the next page, that one diſtinguiſhing character of a congregational church is,
<q>That there is no juriſdiction to which particular churches are or ought to be ſubject, by way of authoritative cenſure, nor any other <hi>church power,</hi> extrinſical to ſuch churches, which they ought to depend upon <hi>any other ſort of men</hi> for the exerciſe of.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here the point turns: We all hold it proper occaſionally to improve the advice and gifts of other churches, while all are equal as to power: but all miniſters who think they have a power to impart to another church, which that church has not within itſelf, and has not a right to exerciſe without aſſiſtance received from abroad; they are not congregational men, let them pretend what they will.</p>
            <p>Another great point in the congregational plan is, that the "power to open and ſhut," is in the church as a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and therefore that they all ought to hear and judge of the evidence that any give of their right to be received as members. Dr. <hi>Increaſe Mather</hi> ſays,
<q>There is <hi>no congregational</hi> man, but he <hi>reports to the church</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what the perſon deſiring communion with them, has related to him; which the <hi>preſbyterian</hi> does not, only declares his own ſatisfaction, and giveth the brethren a liberty to object againſt their converſation.</q>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mitchel's Life. dedicat. p. 23.</note> And he tells us, that in the declaration of the <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>order</hi> of the <hi>congregational churches</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> given at <hi>Savoy,</hi> Oct. 12. 1658. They declare, <note n="‖" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 24.</note>
               <q>That the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010823_0010_0F81D47153D83EF8"/>
members of particular churches are ſaints by calling, viſibly manifeſting their obedience to the call of Chriſt, who being further known to each other, by their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſaith, wrought <hi>in them</hi> by the power of God, <hi>declared by themſelves,</hi> or otherwiſe manifeſted, conſent to walk together according to the appointment of Chriſt.</q>
The doctor further ſays,
<q>It is evident, that the church (and not the officers only) have power given them by Chriſt to judge who are meet to be <hi>put out</hi> of their communion. Matt. 18.17. 1 Cor. 5.12. Then they muſt needs have the like power as to thoſe that are to be <hi>taken into</hi> their communion.</q>
And is this the way now of the churches Mr. <hi>F.</hi> pleads for? No, I never knew an inſtance in my day, of any who were admitted into any of thoſe churches, by declaring <hi>perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the ſaith wrought in</hi> their ſouls; and a great part of them have now dropt even giving <hi>written relations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This leads us down to a third article of difference which is the root of all, namely, the <hi>matter</hi> of a goſpel church. We have already ſeen that Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſuppoſeth that the
<q>chriſtian church is made up of the ſame <hi>materials</hi> that the jewiſh church was.</q>
But the <hi>Cambridge</hi> platform expreſsly ſays,
<q>The <hi>matter</hi> of a viſible church are ſaints by calling, 1 Cor. 1.2. Eph. 1.1.</q>
and that the church
<q>under the law, was <hi>national,</hi> which ſince the coming of Chriſt is <hi>only congregational</hi>; therefore neither national, provincial nor claſſical.</q>
Yet Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> has the face to tell the world that their
<q>churches are, in general, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly <hi>congregational.</hi>
               </q>
And then goes on to produce the teſtimony of preſident <hi>Oaks</hi> in favour of that plan, as the "higheſt ſtep that has been taken towards <hi>reformation</hi>;" to which he ſays,
<q>The venerable Dr. <hi>Increaſe Mather</hi> adds the weight of his approbation,</q>
p. 80. After which, a long quotation is produced from the doctor in favor of the <hi>college,</hi> from whence almoſt all the churches were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with miniſters; yet he ſtopt a little too ſhort at laſt; for that venerable author's next words are theſe, viz.
<q>Nor are the churches like to continue <hi>pure golden can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſticks,</hi> if the <hi>college,</hi> which ſhould ſupply them, prove <hi>apoſtate.</hi>
               </q>
And in the ſame book, he lets us know what he means by that dreadful name,
<q>The deb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſing, ſays he, the <hi>matter</hi> of particular churches muſt needs corrupt them. A learned and renowned author (i. e. Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>) has evidenced that the letting go this principle, that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010823_0010_0F81D47153D83EF8"/>
particular churches ought to conſiſt of <hi>regenerate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,</hi> brought in the great <hi>apoſtate of the chriſtian church.</hi> The way to prevent the like <hi>apoſtacy,</hi> (ſays Dr. <hi>Mather</hi>) in theſe churches, is to require an <hi>account</hi> of thoſe that offer themſelves to communion therein, concerning the <hi>work of God on their ſouls,</hi> as well as concerning their knowlege and belief.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mitchel's life. dedicat. p. 27. &amp; 16.</note> And he tells us <note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 10.</note> that
<q>Bleſſed Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> would frequently aſſert, that if it ſhould paſs for current doctrine in <hi>New-England,</hi> that all perſons <hi>orthodox in judgment,</hi> as to matters of faith, not <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in life,</hi> ought to be admitted to partake of the Lord's ſupper, without an examination, concerning the <hi>work of ſaving grace in their hearts,</hi> it would be a real <hi>apoſtacy</hi> from former principles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And are miniſters now of theſe ſentiments? A worthy gentleman told me that he ſat a number of years at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blehead,</hi> under the miniſtry of <note n="‡" place="bottom">He has been preſident of <hi>Harvard College</hi> this 30 years.</note> Mr. <hi>Holyoke,</hi> before he was elected preſident of the ſame college that theſe words were directed to; and that his common method of admitting members into the church was without giving them any relation of experiences at all, either verbal or written; and that has now got to be a prevailing cuſtom in many parts of the country. Yet miniſters pretend to be upon the ſame foundation with thoſe fathers. But here is a treble teſtimony that they are <hi>apoſtates</hi> therefrom. And Dr. <hi>Increaſe Mather</hi> had ſuch a view of its coming on, that he ſaid in the year 1700, that
<q>If the begun <hi>apoſtacy</hi> ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed as faſt the next thirty years, as it has done the laſt, ſurely it will come to that in <hi>New-England,</hi> (except the goſpel itſelf depart with the order of it) that the moſt conſcientious people therein, will think themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to <hi>gather churches out of churches.</hi>
               </q>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">See the preface to his vindication of the order of the churches in <hi>New-England.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>Now we may form ſome judgment how far this apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had proceeded, when our ſeparation began, more than forty years afterwards, by a ſort of <hi>paſtoral letter,</hi> which all the miniſters in <hi>Windham</hi> county publiſhed againſt us; wherein they ſay,
<q>This notion of a pure church, as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating the converted from the unconverted, is contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the revealed will of God. This is as evident as any thing can be by that way of evidence, in divers pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables of our Savior,</q>
p. 20. The firſt parable which
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:010823_0011_0F81D4720F00BA90"/>
they refer us to, is that of the <hi>tares of the field,</hi> in Matt. 13.24, &amp;c. And they ſay,
<q>Our Savior explains it to his diſciples, as you ſee from verſe 37. Where he ſays, <hi>The field is the world</hi>; in which therefore is this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven. <hi>The good ſeed are the children of the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one.</hi> Both the one and the other are in the kingdom of heaven which is in this world, i. e. <hi>the viſible church,</hi>
               </q>
p. 21. And after giving their thoughts upon ſeveral other ſcriptures, they ſay,
<q>There are many other texts which might be urged, and plainly ſhew, that it is the will of Chriſt, that all thoſe who make an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward credible profeſſion of chriſtianity,</hi> ſhould be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into his church, and tho' <hi>unconverted be there</hi> among the wheat the honorable veſſels, ſo long as he has a church in the world, that they may be under proper ordinances for their converſion, and for the trial of his people, and their uſefulneſs to them, &amp;c.</q>
p. 23.</p>
            <p>I leave the reader to judge how near this doctrine comes to what Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> and other fathers call <hi>apoſtacy,</hi> and alſo how <hi>current</hi> this doctrine has paſt, when the miniſters of a whole county, have publiſhed it to the world; and world only remark here, that they have done like thoſe who formerly made <hi>void</hi> the divine command by their own <hi>traditions</hi>; for as they have contradicted our ſaviour in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the parable of the <hi>tares,</hi> and the <hi>field</hi> which he ſays is the <hi>world,</hi> they ſay is the <hi>church</hi>; ſo they have made void his command in this very affair. His command is, <hi>Let both grow together</hi>: but their practice has ſaid, No, they ſhall not; for as ſoon as any appear'd againſt their ſchemes, they would not let them grow, nor enjoy their natural rights. Mr <hi>Finley,</hi> who has ſince been preſident of <hi>New Jerſey</hi> college, happened to come in thoſe times to <hi>New-Haven,</hi> and only for his preaching to the ſeparates there, he was taken up by civil officers and carried out of the colony; and thoſe who belong'd among us, that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured publickly to improve their gifts without the miniſters licence, were not ſuffered to enjoy <hi>worldly</hi> privileges, but were taken up one after another, and caſt into priſon.

<pb n="21" facs="unknown:010823_0011_0F81D4720F00BA90"/>
practice became ſo odious that none would buy ſuch goods; and then they took to ſeizing their perſons. I have an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count before me of no leſs than <hi>eleven</hi> perſons who were ſeized thus and carried to jail in <hi>Norwich</hi> only in 8 months, after <hi>June</hi> 17, 1752. one of which was a <hi>widow</hi> 54 years old who belonged to another church, where ſhe attended, and did her part towards the ſupport of divine worſhip, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her conſcience, and had no concern with the pariſh miniſter; therefore ſhe did not think that the rate which was demanded for him was juſt: yet for her refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to pay it, ſhe was taken, and, tho' a weakly woman was carried to priſon in a dark rainy night. One told them then that it look'd like the <hi>works of darkneſs.</hi> But the chriſtian character ſhe bore, and the chriſtian temper which ſhe and others then diſcovered, greatly weakened the cauſe they deſigned to promote hereby.</p>
            <p>Not long after, a gentleman in the ſame place, was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned for the ſame cauſe, while he ſtood a repreſentative for the town, in the general court. About the ſame time a ſingle woman of a good character, in <hi>Raynham,</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined more than 12 months in <hi>Taunton</hi> goal, which the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter might have prevented by croſſing out, only an <hi>eight penny</hi> rate. At length the evidence ſhe gave of true <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientiouſneſs</hi> in the matter, cauſed ſuch uneaſineſs among that miniſter's own people, that they raiſed money and went and ſet her at liberty. This is but a little ſketch of what has been done of that nature, in various parts of our land.</p>
            <p>If any ſay, Why are theſe odious things publiſhed now? I anſwer, <hi>Is there not a cauſe</hi>? When the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> complained a few years ago to the king of <hi>Spain,</hi> that many things were publiſhed againſt them, and deſired him to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it; his reply was,

And an author of great note has lately told the world that,

            <p>"The experience of all reformed churches," is appealed to for proof, that this <hi>coercive</hi> power is needful to keep the <hi>order of the goſpel</hi>: but the ſame appeal might more juſtly be made, to prove that the clergy, when <hi>thus</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, have been the moſt tyrannical of all men; which has often ſerved to harden infidels againſt all goſpel prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers. A plain reaſon why ſuch men have been the moſt tyrannical, is becauſe they claim authority, more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the <hi>higher</hi> power, than others do. Tho' civil authority is of divine appointment, as well as eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; yet the higheſt civil rulers know, that they are ſet up and ſupported by men, while the others claim a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion from God.

a little further lay open my views of this affair; which are, that, as civil rulers ought to be men fearing God, and hating covetouſneſs, and to be terrors to evil doers, and a praiſe to them who do well; and as miniſters ought to pray for rulers, and to teach the people to be ſubject to them; So there may and ought to be a ſweet harmony between them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet as there is a great difference between the nature of their work, they never ought to have <hi>ſuch a union</hi> together, as was deſcribed above.</p>
            <p>For, 1. The holy ghoſt calls the orders and laws of civil ſtates <hi>ordinances of man,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.13. But all the rules and orders of divine worſhip are <hi>ordinances of God</hi>; and it <hi>defi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>AS EVERY man hath received the <hi>gift, even ſo</hi> miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God. If <hi>any man ſpeak,</hi> let him ſpeak as the oracles of God; if <hi>any man miniſter,</hi> let him do it as of the <hi>ability</hi> which GOD GIVETH: that GOD <hi>in all things may be glorified thro' Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </q>
1 Pet. 4.10, 11. But this law and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der has been ſo much <hi>changed</hi> in our land, that churches have not looked ſo much at the <hi>ability</hi> which <hi>God</hi> has <hi>given,</hi> as to the <hi>titles</hi> which <hi>man</hi> has <hi>beſtowed.</hi> I ſay <hi>titles,</hi> for many of their miniſters have not <hi>gifts</hi> to deliver a ſermon without <hi>reading</hi>; notwithſtanding their <hi>name</hi> of being <hi>learned</hi> men. And yet it is called, the
<q>order of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,</q>
now, to have ſuch men's <hi>perſons in admiration</hi> ſo as not to chuſe any others into the miniſtry, <hi>leſt man's glory ſhould be brought down,</hi> while we are repreſented as proud rebels, for not owning them as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The civil magiſtrates work is, to promote order and peace among men, in their moral behaviour towards each other, ſo that every perſon among all denominations who doth <hi>that which is good</hi> may <hi>have praiſe of the ſame</hi>; and and that all contrary behaviour may be reſtrained, or
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010823_0013_0F81D472F7F5F938"/>
forcibly puniſhed. And as all ſorts of men are members of civil ſociety and partake of the benefits of ſuch government, therefore they ought to be <hi>ſubject,</hi> and pay <hi>tribute</hi> to rulers. Rom. 13.1 —6. But the work of goſpel miniſters is to labour to <hi>open</hi> mens <hi>eyes,</hi> and to <hi>turn them from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God.</hi> Acts. 26.18. And as any kind of <hi>force</hi> tends to ſhut the eyes rather than open them; therefore Chriſt's ſpecial orders to his firſt miniſters were, <hi>Freely ye have received, freely give. And whoſoever ſhall not receive you, nor hear your words; when ye depart out of that houſe, or city, ſhake off the duſt of your feet,</hi> Mat. 10.8, 14. This ſhould be a <hi>teſtimony</hi> againſt them, that Chriſt's miniſters had not forcibly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them ſo much as the duſt of their city, Luk. 9.5.</p>
            <p>But we have a ſet of men in our day, who profeſs to be Chriſt's <hi>ambaſſadors,</hi> and yet they act ſo contrary to theſe <hi>orders,</hi> that if they once can get footing in a town or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, let people diſlike them ever ſo much, they will not go out without a conſiderable quantity of white or yellow <hi>duſt.</hi> Yea, we have had ſeveral inſtances, wherein both church and ſociety have been wearied out with theſe men, and have voted them out of their meeting-houſe, and yet where a little number would follow them, they have held meeting in their own houſe for months or years, and then have applied to the powers which theſe churches <hi>ſtand upon,</hi> and they have <hi>forced</hi> the whole pariſh to pay the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter for all that time. And one miniſter has lately found out, that for any to come and profeſs to
<q>preach the goſpel <hi>freely, without being chargeable to their bearers</hi>; is ſo far from being an evidence that they are the <hi>true miniſters</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt, and <hi>ſent by</hi> him, that 'tis (<hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinaries excepted</hi>) an argument why they ſhould be ſuſpected,</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> page 63.65. <hi>Extraordinary,</hi> is a great word, and great things are done by it.

And it muſt be acknowleged that if this be a true diſcovery, we are in a deplorable caſe; for we uſed to think the goſpel's being <hi>freely preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the poor,</hi> was a convincing evidence that the Meſſiah is come, (Mat. 11.5.) And if it is not ſo, we have been hitherto deluded, and muſt look out for new teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, if not for a new bible.</p>
            <p>However we will endeavor to ſearch our old bible a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more before we part with it. The paſſage which our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor attempts to draw this new diſcovery from, is 2 Cor. 11, 12. Now a material point, in order to come at the meaning of the text, is to know what thoſe falſe apoſtles <hi>gloried in.</hi> Our author ſuppoſeth that they gloried in preaching freely without taking any thing for it: but in v. 20. ſpeaking of the ſame perſons, <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>Ye ſuffer if a man bring you into bondage, if a man devour you, if a man take of you, if a man exalt himſelf.</hi> The clauſe, <hi>take of you</hi>; Dr. <hi>Gill</hi> ſays, the <hi>Arabic</hi> verſion reads,—
<q>Took away their goods from them by <hi>force.</hi>
               </q>
This they did to <hi>exalt themſelves</hi>: and if we look back to the foregoing chapter, we ſhall find, that the ways of theſe teachers, was to <hi>commend themſelves,</hi> and deſpiſe the apoſtle: <hi>His bodily preſence, ſay they, is weak, and his ſpeech contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</hi> When he firſt appeared among that people, he <hi>wrought at tent-making,</hi> on week days, and <hi>reaſoned in the ſynagogue every ſabbath.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 18.3, 4.</note> And his <hi>preaching was not with enticing words of mans wiſdom.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. 2.4.</note> Therefore they deſpiſed him, and commended themſelves, as being men who made a much better appearance, and taught in a more agreable manner than the <hi>tent-maker</hi> did: but ſays he, <hi>Do ye look on things after the outward appearance</hi>? <note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Cor. 10.7, 10.</note> —It was a ſpecial command of our Lord, <hi>Judge not according to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but judge righteous judgment.</hi> And he gives this rule to judge by, namely, <hi>He that ſpeaketh of himſelf, ſeeketh his own glory: but he that ſeeketh</hi> HIS <hi>glory that ſent him, the ſame is true, and no unrighteouſneſs in him.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>This is the rule to try all teachers by. The occaſion of its being given was, the different opinions that people
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010823_0014_0F81D474205004B8"/>
had concerning the teacher of teachers, ſome ſaying, <hi>He is a good man,</hi> others ſaying, <hi>Nay; but he deceiveth the people</hi>: and a particular difficulty which labored in their minds concerning him, was, that he had <hi>never learned letters</hi> in their way. <note n="*" place="bottom">verſe 12.15.</note> Therefore he ſays, judge not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the <hi>appearance</hi>; yet this rule was not attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to among the <hi>Corinthians</hi>; and inſtead of it, thoſe teachers who deſpiſed the apoſtle, <hi>meaſured themſelves by themſelves, and compared themſelves among themſelves</hi>: but he durſt not <hi>make himſelf of their number.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Cor. 10.12.</note> Theſe things ſhew what thoſe teachers <hi>gloried</hi> in. And <hi>Paul</hi> declares his <hi>godly jealouſy</hi> over the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in the beginning of this 11th chapter; and his fear leſt their minds ſhould be <hi>corrupted</hi> from the <hi>ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prevent their being further impoſed upon, (tho' it be folly for a man to <hi>commend</hi> himſelf, yet) he would <hi>anſwer a fool according to his folly,</hi> to prevent their being <hi>wiſe in their own conceits.</hi> And he ſets out to compare notes with them, and ſays, <hi>I ſuppoſe I was not a whit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the very chiefeſt apoſtles.</hi> And as to the low appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance which he made among them, he aſks, <hi>Have I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted an offence in abaſing myſelf, that you may be exalted, becauſe I preached to you the goſpel of God freely?</hi> And proceeds to ſhew how he had received ſupport from other churches <hi>to do them ſervice</hi>: and he takes a ſolemn oath, that <hi>no man</hi> in their <hi>regions</hi> ſhould ſtop him of this boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; not becauſe he did not love them! But, ſays he, what <hi>I do, I will do, that I may cut off occaſion from them which deſire occaſion, that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we</hi>: for <hi>ſuch are falſe apoſtles &amp;c.</hi> Now if they had gloried in preaching for nothing, 'tis certain from v. 20. that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> knew that they practiſed the contrary; and <hi>Paul</hi> would not have ſaid,—<hi>even as we,</hi> to that.

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot find the leaſt account of their glorying in preach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing without wages; but I have ſhewn ſomething of wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> they did glory in: and the apoſtle proceeds further and ſays <hi>I ſpeak fooliſhly; are they Hebrews? ſo am I: are they Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites? ſo am I: are they the ſeed of Abraham? ſo am I are they miniſters of Chriſt? I am more.</hi> Thus he ſhews that as to outward appearance he could vie with them; while in real ſervices and ſufferings for Chriſt, he vaſtly exceeded them. Yea, while they had taken much from that church only for a <hi>ſhew</hi> of ſervice, he had done them much <hi>real</hi> ſervice without taking any thing at all of them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall cloſe this head with this remark; that while Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſeems pleaſed with what he tho't would do great execution againſt us, he has unawares involved himſelf in a ſad <hi>dilem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>: for if the caſe be as I have repreſented, he ſtands a fair chance of falling among falſe teachers: but if his ſenſe of the text be right, he ſhews a want of <hi>Paul</hi>'s temper, and inſtead of cutting off occaſion of being called a hireling, he ſtill pleads up for that ſcheme, which often extorts wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges from ſuch as receive no ſervice from them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of doing real ſervice without wages as <hi>Paul</hi> did. At the ſame time he endeavors artfully to blend a <hi>free</hi> ſupport to miniſters, and a <hi>forced</hi> one together; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as there is as much difference between them, as there is between the power of truth in the mind, and the power of the civil ſword on the body. The firſt is abundantly clear in ſcripture, the other has no warrant there.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another difference between civil and eccleſiaſtical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment is, that civil ſtates if large, have various degrees of offices one above another, who receive their authority thro' many hands, down from the head, and that often, more according to eſtate or favor, than merit: but 'tis the reverſe in Chriſt's kingdom; he forbid the firſt notions of this in his diſciples, and expreſsly told them that it <hi>ſhould not be ſo</hi> among them, as it was in earthly ſtates, <hi>Mark</hi> 10.43. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.26.

reſiſted or abuſed, 'tis found neceſſary, in order to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the dignity of government, to inflict corporal puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the offenders, if within the ſtate, and to take up the ſword againſt abuſes from abroad. And I ſuppoſe it is a true maxim, that
<q>civil government and a defenſive war will ſtand or fall together.</q>
Hence Jeſus ſaid, <hi>If my kingdom were of this world, then would my ſervants fight, that I ſhould not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</hi> Joh. 18.36. Therefore the dignity of his government is maintained, not by <hi>carnal,</hi> but by <hi>ſpiritual</hi> weapons: and not by <hi>reſiſting,</hi> but pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently <hi>bearing</hi> evil treatment. Hence when one of his chief officers was greatly abuſed he ſaid, <hi>Being reviled, we bleſs: being perſecuted, we ſuffer it: being defamed, we intreat: we are made the filth of the world, and are the off-ſcouring of all things unto this day.</hi> 1 Cor. 4.12.13. And the way in which the ſaints finally obtain victory over the <hi>dragon</hi> and <hi>his angels</hi> is, <hi>by the blood of the lamb, and the word of their teſtimony; and not loving their lives unto the death.</hi> Rev. 12.11.</p>
            <p>I have been the more particular on theſe things, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the core of our difficulties lies here. And if the kind reader finds here but an imperfect deſcription of the way of the churches acting upon truth, in diſtinction from all earthly powers, let him remember that this is a <hi>high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> that has been very much <hi>unoccupied</hi> in later ages, and men have gone in <hi>by ways:</hi> but 'tis hoped that this <hi>good old way</hi> will ſpeedily be opened ſo plainly that <hi>fools ſhall not err therein</hi>: and if this weak attempt may be owned as any means thereof, that will over-balance all the world's reproaches on that account. The confounding of civil and eccleſiaſtical affairs together has done amazing miſchief in the world: and as Dr. <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> obſerves
<q>The reforming churches flying from <hi>Rome,</hi> carried ſome of them more, ſome of them leſs, all of them ſomething of <hi>Rome,</hi> with them, eſpecially in that ſpirit of impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perſecution, which has too much cleaved unto them all.</q>
This was the worſt miſtake that our fathers brought with them to this land; &amp; tho' their poſterity will generally explode thoſe bitter <hi>fruits</hi>; yet few of them ſeem to be ſenſible of the <hi>root</hi> from whence they ſprang.

But Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi> the miniſter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute to bring in the ſcheme there, and got a majority on his ſide; therefore rather than come under ſuch a yoke, they, with a conſiderable part of the church withdrew, and held a ſeparate meeting three months; and then the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter conſented to have the matter tried by a council, tho' in the mean time he had laid them under <hi>church cenſure</hi>; an account of which being conveyed to the general <hi>court,</hi> the repreſentatives were not ſuffered to ſit therein.

This he thought to be a reaſonable requeſt, and therefore appointed a meeting among them in the beginning of the year 1742. But before the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed time came, he received two letters, one from ſome of the inhabitants of that town, the other from ſome neighbouring miniſters, which informed him that they did not think it would be for the beſt for him to preach among that people, and deſired he would not; but gave no reaſon at all. Yet becauſe he would not put by a meeting which he had appointed merely at their requeſt, without any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon given, he was firſt excluded from the <hi>conſociation,</hi> and then complaints were received there againſt him, from a few of his diſaffected people; upon which he made an attempt to get reconciled again to the miniſters, but found it could not be done upon any lower terms, than confeſſing that he did wrong in preaching to that <hi>baptiſt</hi> ſociety as he did. <hi>That</hi> he could not in conſcience do; ſo they part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which opened a wider door for complaints than before, and ſo many were carried in, that a conſociation was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his own town to try the caſe, and a citation was ſent to him to come and anſwer to many articles.</p>
            <p>Hereupon Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> called his church together, and laid theſe articles before them, with anſwers thereto; and the church manifeſted ſatisfaction therewith: and as they found that the church was originally ſettled according to <hi>Cambridge platform,</hi> and had never voted an alteration; they now voted to abide by their old conſtitution, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> and others to go and inform the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociation that they denied their juriſdiction, and would not be tried by them. This was accordingly done; yet this

               <hi>ſpiritual court</hi> declared that they had juriſdiction of the caſe, and went on to hear and try charges againſt him, without any to anſwer for him; and drew up and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed their judgment that
<q>Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> was criminally guilty of the breach of the <hi>third</hi> the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>ninth</hi> commands, and <hi>many goſpel rule,</hi>
               </q>
and ſo warned all to beware of him, 'till he made ſatisfaction therefor. Mr. <hi>Robbins,</hi> having copies of theſe proceedings, publiſhed them to the world, in 1747. Afterward four of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Branford</hi> (if I remember right their number) went to the general court with a complaint that the town ſtill held this condemned man for their miniſter, and prayed the court to turn him out of his place.

In civil ſtates particular men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with authority to judge for the whole; but in Chriſt's kingdom each one has an equal right to judge for himſelf.

<q>There was the moſt wonderful work of God, that ever was known in this part of the world, both for the extent and viſible appearance of it.</q>

<q>there was a marvellous mixture of almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing <hi>good</hi> and <hi>bad,</hi> — for while the ſpirit of God wrought <hi>powerfully,</hi> ſatan raged <hi>maliciouſly,</hi> and acted his old ſubtle part to <hi>deceive.</hi>

p. 115. And ſeveral of his obſervations concerning Mr. <hi>James Davenport</hi> I believe are juſt, but others I think are not ſo.</p>
            <p>He muſt be a great ſtranger to the bible, who does not know that in times of great declenſion, teachers are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as much, if not the moſt corrupt of any; therefore in a reformation, thoſe corruptions are always more or leſs expoſed, and warned againſt. And when Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> had his eyes opened to ſee the dreadful caſe of miniſters as well as people, he having been trained up among miniſters who claimed moſt of the power to themſelves, was more eaſily led to the extream, of openly declaring of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment concerning ſeveral miniſters, and ſo of calling peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010823_0017_0F81D475EA7EA1B0"/>
to ſeparate from them, becauſe <hi>he judged</hi> them to be unconverted. And a number of ſeparations were produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by that means; but thoſe ſeparations were not from the general conſtitution of the churches; they were only from particular miniſters. Whereas our ſeparations begun ſeveral years afterwards, and upon quite different princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; yet Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> would lay them all at his door, while he ſpeaks highly of Mr. <hi>Gilbert Tennant,</hi> who travelled and preached in the moſt noted places in <hi>New-England,</hi> in the beginning of that work.</p>
            <p>But did Mr. <hi>F.</hi> never ſee the ſermon on the <hi>danger of an unconverted miniſtry,</hi> which that "ſon of thunder," as he calls him, publiſhed ſoon after, from Mar. 6.34? wherein, after drawing the character of Phariſee-teachers, and ſhewing how people ſhould be pitied, who have ſuch teachers, he ſays,

It is true ſome of the modern Phariſees have learned to prate a little more <hi>orthodoxly</hi> about the new birth, than their predeceſſor, <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> who are, in the mean time, as great ſtrangers to the feeling experience of it, as he. They are blind who ſee not this to be the caſe of the <hi>body</hi> of the clergy, of this generation — Alas his not it the caſe of multitudes?

It muſt be confeſt that his language is ſharp and cutting, like <hi>Luther's</hi> formerly; yet many of his reaſonings are weighty; of which at preſent I will only give two extracts more; one is in his anſwer to that complaint, that his principles will cauſe contentions among people; to which he ſays,

p. 16. The other extract is in anſwer to a ſaying which we have often heard, viz. That 'tis a mere fiction to tell of getting good when we go over the pariſh line, becauſe as they ſay, <hi>we are out of God's way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this Mr. <hi>Tennant</hi> anſwers,
<q>That there are three monſtrous ingredients in the objection, namely a begging of the queſtion in debate, raſh judging, and limiting of God.</q>
p. 18 They beg the queſtion who ſuppoſe we go out of God's way, becauſe we go over man's line: and how raſh is it to judge that others get no good, only becauſe they don't go in their way? And ſuch are much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable than the <hi>Jews</hi> were, if they think to limit divine bleſſings to any particular <hi>houſe</hi> or ſpot of ground. Now Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ought to know that we read and conſidered theſe things in thoſe times, as well as what Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> ſaid: yea, and ſo we did the writings of a divine of greater note than either of theſe, who in thoſe times ſaid,
<q>We that are miniſters, by looking on this work, from year to year, with a diſpleaſed countenance ſhall effectually keep the ſheep from their paſture, inſtead of doing the part of ſhepherds to them, by feeding them; and our people had a <hi>great deal better</hi> be without any ſettled miniſter at all, at ſuch a day as this.</q>

<q>You muſt not judge.</q>
But that was ſo far from preventing, that it naturally produced a judgment in young converts, that thoſe who were offended at ſuch free invitations, were ſtrangers to vital religion: and doubtleſs many exceeded due bounds in that way; yet to be more ſeverely dealt with therefor, than others were for the vileſt crimes, (as many were) this had no tendency to convince them that they were wrong, or their reprovers right.</p>

               <p>The firſt of our ſeparate churches was at <hi>Canterbury</hi>; and the <hi>ſeparation</hi> began in this manner. The <hi>pariſh</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a man to preach to them, who had been <hi>licenced</hi> for that purpoſe, by the <hi>aſſociation</hi> in that county.

<q>deſtitute of thoſe <hi>eſſential qualifications</hi> that ought to be in a miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore refuſed to join with the ſociety in their choice.</q>
And, as the ſociety perſiſted in their choice, and were juſtified therein by the <hi>miniſters,</hi> the <hi>church</hi> at length withdrew, and met at a private houſe. After which the conſociation was called; and under their direction, a number of the members openly renounced the former principles of the <hi>church,</hi> and put themſelves under <hi>Saybrook</hi> regulation, and choſe Mr. <hi>Cogſwell,</hi> whom the ſociety had called before, and got him ordained as their miniſter. And they afterward,
<q>ſent ſome of the members of the <hi>church</hi> to priſon, for not attending on his miniſtry; yea, and threatned to proſecute Mr. <hi>Buell</hi> for ſtaying in the town to preach the goſpel, upon the deſire of many members of the <hi>church,</hi> without the vote of the ſociety.</q>

firſt ſeparate church. It is the firſt church in <hi>Canterbury,</hi> who retain their ancient <hi>principles,</hi> their <hi>records,</hi> and other furniture of the <hi>church</hi>: and are called <hi>ſeparate,</hi> only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they refuſed to give up their <hi>judgments</hi> to the <hi>clergy</hi> and the world, <note n="*" place="bottom">I ſay the <hi>world</hi>; for the <hi>law</hi> requires no other qualification to make a <hi>voter</hi> in their pariſhes, but a certain quantity of <hi>worldly</hi> eſtate.</note> in ſo important an affair, as the choice of a <hi>guide for their ſouls.</hi> Indeed that <hi>aſſociation</hi> in their <hi>letter</hi> againſt the ſeparates, p. 41, 42. ſay,
<q>If there be any of us, whoſe miniſtry is not edifying, or who diſpenſe not the word as we ought,—you ought to uſe the means which Chriſt has appointed for our conviction and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or rejection.</q>
And they declare the churches have <hi>liberty</hi>
                  <q>to chooſe their own way of church diſcipline, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Saybrook</hi> platform, preſbyterian or congregational.</q>
And yet in the next breath they accuſe the ſeparates with
<q>rejecting the miniſtry and churches of Chriſt, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up without any divine inſtitution.</q>
Whereas, the very act of this church, which they are condemned for, was adhering to the <hi>congregational</hi> plan, and taking the only goſpel way they had left to clear themſelves of a miniſter, whoſe preaching was not <hi>edifying</hi> to them.</p>
               <p>I ſay the only <hi>goſpel</hi> method they had left; for the church had called a <hi>congregational council</hi> before, and after he was ordained

apoſtles, and were not: and had <hi>found them liars,</hi> Rev. 2.2. And the true apoſtles, while they gave to the firſt goſpel chruch, a deſcription of what ſort of men ſhould be choſen into office in their preſence, they did not pretend to <hi>nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate</hi> any; but ſaid, <hi>Brethren, look ye out among you,</hi> ſuch men. Act. 6.3. And <hi>Paul</hi> expreſsly ſhews, that <hi>letters of commendation</hi> in his time were TO and FROM THE CHURCH, 2 Cor. 3.1.</p>
               <p>But theſe miniſters now, arrogate the power to <hi>try,</hi> and <hi>approbate</hi> miniſters, wholly to themſelves; and aſſiſted in <hi>cauſing a diviſion</hi> in the church of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> becauſe they would not ſubmit to that power, <hi>contrary to the doctrine which they had learned,</hi> in the goſpel. Here therefore, the text which they often caſt upon us, is ſtrictly applicable to them.
<q>Mark them which <hi>cauſe diviſions</hi> and offences, <hi>contrary to the doctrine which ye have learned</hi>; and AVOID <hi>them</hi>: for they that are ſuch, <hi>ſerve not</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but <hi>their</hi> own <hi>belly</hi>; and by <hi>good words</hi> and <hi>fair ſpeeches</hi> DECEIVE the hearts of the ſimple.</q>
Rom. 16.17.18. They were as truly the <hi>cauſe</hi> of that <hi>diviſion,</hi> as ever King <hi>Charles</hi> was, of beginning the <hi>civil war</hi> by invading the <hi>rights of the Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There was an early diſpute among the apoſtles about <hi>greatneſs</hi>: but their maſter told them that if <hi>any man</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be <hi>firſt,</hi> the ſame ſhould be <hi>laſt of all, and ſervant of all.</hi> Whereupon <hi>John</hi> diſcovered how their ambition had operated: it had moved them to <hi>forbid one</hi> who was acting in <hi>Chriſt's name, becauſe,</hi> ſays he, <hi>he followeth not us.</hi> Mar. 9.35 — 38. Yet what now is the import of their noiſe againſt ſeparates, but this, <hi>They follow not us</hi>? Our Lord repeatedly warned his diſciples againſt aſſuming ſuch a <hi>lordly</hi> power as civil rulers have, and ſaid. So <hi>ſhall it</hi> NOT BE <hi>among you.</hi> Mar. 10.43. Luk. 22.26. And <hi>Peter</hi> exhorted elders not to be as <hi>lords overGod's heritage.</hi> 1 Pet. 5.3. But one of Mr. <hi>Fiſh's</hi> brethren, in the ſame county. <note n="*" place="bottom">County of New London.</note> who is a truſtee of <hi>Yale college,</hi> aſſerts that the
<q>Rights conveyed by the keys,— belonging to the elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip <hi>only,</hi> are as diſtinct from the right of private members, as the rights of a <hi>magiſtrate</hi> are from thoſe of a <hi>freeman,</hi> in a <hi>civil community.</hi>
                  </q>
And adds that, the expreſs charge given them,
<q>not to <hi>lord</hi> it over God's heritage, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them to have ſuch rights and powers <hi>above, over</hi> and diſtinct <hi>from,</hi> and independent <hi>of</hi> the church.</q>

His <hi>firſt letter</hi> was dedicated to gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor <hi>Fitch,</hi> and then he compared <hi>ordination</hi> to the ſwearing a <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate</hi> into his office, after the <hi>freemen</hi> had choſen him, p. 26. But before his <hi>ſecond</hi> letter came out, the <hi>freemen</hi> had dropt his <hi>patron,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>magiſtrates out of office</hi> for favouring the <hi>ſtamp-act.</hi> And what will he do now? for this compariſon will by no means ſuit his turn? Why he ſlips over, and in his ſecond letter compares power of miniſters to that of the "governor of a province, by the King's commiſſion," p, 42. This is a fine compariſon indeed! for ſuch a governor can <hi>negative</hi> councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, and the acts of the general court: Yet by the way ſuch power is too great to be conveyed by a long <hi>ſucceſſion</hi>: if the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor dies, or is removed, the province muſt be without one 'till a <hi>new commiſſion</hi> is granted, <hi>directly</hi> from the King, and the people have no choice in the affair. Thus Mr. <hi>B.</hi> by wandering from truth, has involved himſelf in a ſad <hi>dilemma</hi>; for at home his governor is left out of office by the people, and that power he would not allow the church; and abroad governors have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions directly from the King; but he has no ſuch thing to ſhow.</note> To which I anſwer, that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if they can't <hi>abuſe</hi> a power they <hi>never had</hi>; yet the experience of all ages proves, that they are prone to <hi>aſſume</hi> a power which Chriſt <hi>never granted</hi>: yea, which he has expreſsly <hi>forbid.</hi> If miniſters would leave their worldly compariſons, and attend only to divine rule, I believe they would find that it belongs to the church with them to try miniſters; and common people have the beſt advantage to know how men behave in their daily walk, and have as good right as any, to judge what <hi>gifts</hi> are edifying, and what <hi>experiences</hi> are clear. What then are thoſe miniſters doing, who aſſume the power to themſelves to judge for the church, and to ſorbid all who <hi>follow not them</hi>?

And as we have ſome other ordained paſtors, who have conſiderable ſkill in both the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongues; and three mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of one ſeparate church in <hi>Norwich,</hi> have each brought up a ſon at college within theſe few years, one of which is now a tutor of <hi>Yale</hi> college; and as a like number have been ſent to college from <hi>Windham,</hi> beſide ſome in other places; I leave Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> to conſider how he can anſwer what he has ſaid, either to God or man.</p>
               <p>However, tho' his <hi>charge</hi> is far from truth, yet 'tis readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted, that we have a great diſlike to ſome ſorts of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, eſpecially the art of diſputing againſt the truth, as well as for it, the art of making eaſy things hard, inſtead of making hard things eaſy; ſuch <hi>oppoſitions of ſcience,</hi> we <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. 6.20</note> have no likening to, nor of the art of handling the <hi>word of God deceitfully,</hi> and twiſting things into any ſhape to ſuit men's own turns. Such things as theſe, I take to be the <hi>leaven</hi> which our Savior warned his diſciples againſt; for what he calls <hi>doctrine</hi> in one place, he calls <hi>hypocriſy</hi> in another. <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 16.12. Luk. 12.1.</note> And what ſhall we think of our author upon this point? Speaking of miniſters work, he ſays,
<q>Our Lord hath ſhewn us, that LEARNING is eminently uſeful, yea even neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Iſai. 50.4. <hi>The Lord God hath given me the tongue of</hi> the learned, that I <hi>ſhould know how to ſpeak a word

in ſeaſon, to him that is weary.</hi> Intimating that he ſhould not have <hi>known how,</hi> without a learned tongue.</q>
p. 175.</p>
               <p>When I read this, I confeſs it cauſed this enquiry in my mind, If Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> knows no better, than to conſtrue this ſcripture ſo, where is his <hi>learning?</hi> and if he does, where is his <hi>honeſty?</hi> His controverſy with us is about <hi>human</hi> learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereas that text expreſſeth <hi>divine</hi> learning, as plain as words can poſſibly do; and there is great reaſon to think, that the prophet here perſonates HIM, who tho' <hi>he were a ſon, yet learned he obedience, by the things which he ſuffered, and being tempted, he is able to ſuccour them that are tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Did any Phariſee ever abuſe ſcripture, to impoſe upon people, worſe than this?</p>
               <p>Let us conſider another ſcripture, namely, 2 Tim. 3.6. which our author gives us a large comment upon, in order to guard againſt thoſe that oppoſe their churches, and clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth it by ſaying,
<q>This deſign is hid from vulgar eyes, by the plauſible covering or pretence, of ſetting truth in a <hi>clearer light,</hi> and building up the church on a <hi>better footing,</hi> and of <hi>purer materials,</hi>
                  </q>
p. 70. Now we may take notice, that the apoſtle makes no diſtinction in the text, between <hi>public</hi> and <hi>private</hi> houſes, for he often taught both <hi>publickly</hi> and from <hi>houſe to houſe</hi>; but what he points out falſe teachers by, is, the manner of their getting in, and the work they do when they are in. As to the firſt, they <hi>creep into houſes</hi>: and we all know that <hi>creeping</hi> is oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to going <hi>upright,</hi> therefore when Peter <hi>diſſembled,</hi> Paul withſtood <hi>him to the face,</hi> becauſe he <hi>walked not uprightly, according to the truth of the goſpel</hi>; and that concerning introducing the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſchemes into the <hi>chriſtian</hi> church, Gal. 2.11 — 14. I leave Mr. <hi>F.</hi> to conſider how well this will agree with his notion, that the
<q>chriſtian church is made up of the <hi>ſame materials,</hi> that the Jewiſh church was.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I remember that Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in his <hi>farewell ſermon</hi> at <hi>Northampton,</hi> warned that people of their danger of being impoſed upon, for he ſaid, he knew the <hi>art</hi> that ſome young miniſters had got, of <hi>diſguiſing</hi> their principles, 'till they could get into place, and then they would corrupt people's minds by degrees. This leads to the other branch of the text under conſideration, which is, that when thoſe teachers are got into houſes, they <hi>lead captive ſilly women laden with ſin, led away with divers luſts.</hi> And how many have there been in our day, who have appeared in a <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſt</hi> garb till they have got ſettled, and then as faſt as
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:010823_0023_0F81D47C5E534E40"/>
any <hi>women</hi> or others came <hi>laden with ſin,</hi> to talk with them about their ſouls concern, they would <hi>lead</hi> them to the <hi>church,</hi> inſtead of leading them to <hi>Chriſt firſt,</hi> and ſo they are ſettled down in a <hi>form of Godlineſs</hi>; and <hi>this ſort</hi> of men, will ſoon <hi>deny the power</hi> of it. verſe. 5. And they are ever <hi>learning,</hi> and never able to come to the <hi>knowledge of the truth,</hi> v. 7. Inſtead of that, they are <hi>truce-breakers</hi>; falſe to the principles which they profeſſed, and break thro' their ſolemnities and engagements; and ſo are <hi>Traitors,</hi> v. 4. And if we had no ſuch men in our land, can it be thought, that we ſhould have heard <hi>Judas</hi> cried up ſo much as we have? I mean not to reflect upon any man's perſon, but only to hold up the plain truth, and leave all men to judge for themſelves; and where any ſuch men are found, God's command in ver. 5. is, <hi>From ſuch turn away.</hi> Mr. <hi>F.</hi> pretends, that thoſe teachers were for building the church, "of purer materials" than others; whereas the text ſpeaks expreſsly of <hi>that ſort</hi> of men, who have the form, but deny the <hi>power of godlineſs.</hi>

               <p>I ſhall only juſt deſire the reader to obſerve, that there appears nothing wanting here, to make him a good preacher, but only the miniſters licence, for he <hi>preach'd</hi> and <hi>exhored,</hi> both in a <hi>doctrinal</hi> and <hi>practical</hi> way; and who could think that ſuch treatment from the other parties, could convince us that we were wrong, and they right? It was far from doing it; but on the other hand, it convinced us that they had turn'd ſo far out of the goſpel line, that we ought not to follow them.</p>
               <p>And on Oct. 9. 1745. A new ſeparate church in <hi>Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> was gathered, and they made choice of Mr. <hi>Thomas Marſh</hi> for their paſtor, who had for many years been a deacon in the ſecond church in <hi>Windham</hi>; and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed his ordination to be on <hi>Jan.</hi> 6. 1746. But the day before, many of the ſtanding miniſters met in that town, and at the ſame time Mr. <hi>Marſh</hi> was ſeized by an officer, and carried to <hi>Windham</hi> Goal, for preaching ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time before, without licence from the miniſters; and on the day propoſed for his ordination, as a great aſſembly were engag'd in religious worſhip, there came up a dozen or fourteen miniſters, and deſired a conference with this new church; hoping likely that now the <hi>ſhepherd</hi> was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, they might <hi>ſcatter the ſheep.</hi> What they talked of, was to try to convince them of their errors; but when they had begun with that old argument, "Take him Goaler!" that powerful argument upon the <hi>body</hi>; what free acceſs could they rationally expect after that, to convince the mind?

Some of thoſe miniſters had been as great <hi>promoters,</hi> and others as great <hi>oppoſers</hi> of the late revival of religion, as any in the land: and the promoters of the work were put forward, and as they came up, they were ſaluted ſomething in this manner, viz. one would ſay,
<q>Dear Mr. <hi>P.</hi> you was the inſtrument of my converſion, and where are you now?</q>
Another,
<q>Dear Mr. <hi>M.</hi> you was the means of awakenings my ſoul, and will you now fight againſt the work of God,</q>
and others to like purpoſe. And afterward they were publickly addreſſed by one of the fathers in the ſeparation, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Solomon Paine.</note> as hear as I can remember, in theſe words,
<q>You dear miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, who were as <hi>heralds</hi> a few years ago, to found the goſpel trumpet thro' the land, where are you now? are you not joined in <hi>confederacy</hi> with thoſe who, your own conſciences teſtify, are enemies to the work of God?</q>

               <p>I would always abide by what we begun upon, under this head, that the ſpirit of Chriſt is not a <hi>fierce, bitter,</hi> and <hi>revengeful</hi> ſpirit, but the reverſe; and that wherever ſuch a ſpirit appears, 'tis a <hi>blemiſh</hi> to any people; and that treatment which he deſcribes was ſo to us; but then he, and all ought to conſider, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>ſurely oppreſſion maketh a wiſe man mad</hi>; and if what we had met with was not <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> I confeſs I know not what may be called ſo; and the <hi>bitter</hi> words which he ſets down, were utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>Mr. <hi>F.</hi> owns, that there is a great alteration among us ſince, and ſays,

But, ſays he,
<q>what does this reaſoning argue? why, it only ſhews that they have loſt a degree of their original <hi>ſpirit</hi> as <hi>ſeparates.</hi>

I ſay ſet up the world <hi>over</hi> the church; for the law requires no other qualification to make a man a voter for a miniſter in their pariſhes, but a certain quantity of <hi>worldly</hi> eſtate: and <hi>ſuch</hi> voters turned the church in <hi>Canterbury</hi> out of the mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting-houſe; and then two members of it, becauſe they would go with the church, <hi>without the camp</hi> of ſuch men, they were turned out of one of the <hi>fountains,</hi> which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> would confine us all to for miniſters.

like the ſtanding church now, and not like the ſeparates, from an account of that church, which is given in the appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix to Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi>'s ordination ſermon; and after picking out a few paſſages, which are chiefly the opinion of the writer of the account, now in the year 1760, he then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers it to the reader to judge how little <hi>reſemblance</hi> there is between them and us, p. 84. But in that ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, p. 32. we are informed, that the

<q>It is matter of great thankfulneſs, that we have Chriſt <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed</hi> in our churches; by ſuch as we receive to full communion there. They open the work of Chriſt in their hearts, and the <hi>relation</hi> thereof is an eminent <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion</hi> of our Lord; experienced ſaints, can gather more than a little from it. It is indeed an ordinance of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful benefit; the Lord planted many <hi>vineyards</hi> in the firſt ſettlement of this country, and there were many <hi>noble vines</hi> in them; it was their <hi>heavenly-mindedneſs</hi> which diſpoſed them to this exerciſe, and by the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding of it, the churches are ſtill filled with <hi>noble vines</hi>; it mightily maintains PURITY of churches: 'tis the duty of EVERY Chriſtian. It is a thing that gives great glory to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and <hi>young converts</hi> are thereby exceedingly edified; and the ſouls of <hi>devout chriſtians</hi> are hereby ingratiated one unto another. The <hi>devil</hi> knows what he does when he <hi>thruſts</hi> ſo hard to get <hi>this cuſtom</hi> out of our churches. For my part, I would ſay in this caſe, <hi>get thee behind me ſatan; thou giveſt an horrible offence unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Let us keep up this ordinance with all <hi>gentleneſs</hi>; and where we ſee the leaſt ſpark of <hi>grace</hi> held forth, let us prize it more than all the wit in the world.</q>

               <p>Indeed our author has got a fine way to get along here, which is by turning off ſuch things for <hi>imperfections,</hi> and he ſays the <hi>order</hi> of the churches

               <p>Mr. <hi>F</hi>'s. notion of the order of the churches being <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi> then, makes me think of a ſtory concerning a miniſter who deſcended from a member of that ſynod, who tho' his conduct was not good, yet boaſted of treading in his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers ſteps; whereupon another miniſter of greater note ſaid,
<q>He had got his grandfathers <hi>imperfections</hi> to <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi>

Though Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> was then active in bringing in what he called the <hi>middle-way</hi>; Yet the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of being careful how perſons were admitted to the Lord's-ſupper, ſtill lay upon his mind, and he wrote his tho'ts thereon on Jan. 4. 1664. Wherein, among other things, he brings in this objection, viz. Why may it not
<q>ſuffice, for a man publickly to ſay, <hi>I believe on Chriſt, or do unfeignedly repent of my ſins?</hi> Or to conſent to ſuch expreſſions being read, or propounded unto him, without any more adoe?</q>
His anſwer is
<q>1ſt.

And if he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay it, <hi>groundedly,</hi> it is not meet to put him ſo to ſay, 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>.

               <p>There has been a great deal of ſmother raiſed in our day to hide or get over theſe ſelf evident truths, many have been for lowering the profeſſion ſo that it might not imply ſaving faith in it; but Zion's king ſays <hi>He that is not for me is againſt me</hi>; and he declares that <hi>publicans</hi> and <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots go into the kingdom of God before</hi> thoſe who ſaid, <hi>I go ſir; and went not. Halting between two opinions</hi>; a pretending to be for God, and yet not being <hi>truly</hi> ſo, has always been one of the greateſt evils, and moſt fatal ſnares that any men can be taken in. And as to the noiſe which many have made againſt our principles as tho' they tended
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:010823_0029_0F81D4862631F828"/>
to perplex ſincere minds; this argument has juſtly been retorted back again: for none will pretend to admit per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons without ſome ſort of qualification or other: and 'tis vaſtly more difficult to determine the point concerning <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> ſincerity, than <hi>gracious</hi> ſincerity; for the firſt is only reſtraints and influences <hi>upon</hi> a perſon, while the other is a living principle <hi>within</hi> him; and I think this is an unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able reaſon which Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> gives, why the latter, and not the other, makes meet members for Chriſt's Church, namely that moral ſincerity is <hi>tranſient,</hi> and may be intire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loſt; but a gracious principle <hi>abides</hi> for ever. As to the frightful conſequence which ſome draw, that if none but gracious perſons ought to be received to communion, then we can never know whether our communion is right or not, in this world: Old Mr. <hi>Shephard</hi> gave a ſufficient anſwer thereto an 120 years ago, in theſe words.</p>

And as a principal means of begetting and increaſing this love, is <hi>declaring</hi> to each other what <hi>God has done</hi> for our <hi>ſouls</hi>; ſo our Lord ſays, <hi>Every tree is known by his own fruit,—a good man out of the good treaſure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good:</hi> And the beloved diſciple ſays, <hi>That which we have ſeen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye alſo may have fellowſhip with us,</hi> &amp;c. And to ſhew that our ſentiments are not ſingular, as well as for the edification of the ſaints, I will here tranſcribe a little of what was wrote in the laſt century, by one who is allow'd to be a man of as great learning and piety as any in his day.</p>
               <p>I mean Dr. <hi>John Owen,</hi> who, after obſerving how men are liable to miſtakes in various ways, and giving cautions accordingly, he proceeds to ſpeak of ſome duties which can't be performed without ſome knowledge of others ſtate, and alſo of the way wherein it is attained," 1ſt. There are, ſays he,
<q>many duties incumbent on us to be performed, with and towards profeſſors, which without admitting a judgment to be made of their ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, cannot be performed in faith. And in reference unto theſe duties alone, it is that we are called to judge the ſtate of others. For we are not giving countenance unto a raſh uncharitable cenſuring of mens ſpiritual conditions, nor unto any judging of any men, any other than what our own duty towards them doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpenſably require. Thus if we are to lay down our lives for the brethren, it is very meet that we ſhould ſo far know them ſo to be, as that we may hazard our lives in faith when we are called thereunto. We are alſo to join with them in thoſe ordinances wherein we make a ſolemn profeſſion, that we are members of the ſame body with them, that we have the ſame head, the ſame faith and love: we muſt love them becauſe they are begotten of God, children of our heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and therefore muſt on ſome good ground believe them ſo to be. In a word, the due performance of all principal mutual goſpel duties, to the glory of God, and our own edification, depend upon this ſuppoſition, that we may have ſuch ſatisfying perſuaſion concerning the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:010823_0030_0F81D4866A417970"/>
ſpiritual condition of others, as that from which we may take our aim in what we do.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">
                  <q>2. For the grounds hereof, I ſhall mention one only, which all others do lean upon. This is preſſed, 1 Cor. 12.12, 13. As the body is one, and hath many mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and all the members of that one body being many, are one body, ſo is Chriſt: for by one ſpirit we are all bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free, and have been made all to drink into one ſpirit. They are all united unto, and hold of one head; ſo is Chriſt myſtical, that is, all believers under Chriſt their head. And this union they have by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the ſame quickning Spirit, which is in Chriſt their head, and by him they are all brought into the ſame ſpiritual ſtate and frame; they are made to drink into one and the ſame ſpirit; for this ſame ſpirit pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the ſame effects in them all, the ſame in kind tho' differing in degrees, as the apoſtle fully declares. Eph. 4.3—6. And this ſpirit is in them and not in the world, Joh. 16. And as it gives them a naturalneſs in their duties one towards another, or in mutual caring for, rejoicing and ſorrowing with one another as mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers one of another. 1 Cor. 12.25, 26. So that it reveals and diſcovers them to each other, ſo far as is necceſſary for the performance of the duties mentioned, in ſuch a manner as becomes members of the ſame body. There is on this account a ſpiritually natural anſwering of one to another, as face anſwereth face in the water, they can ſee and diſcern that in others whereof they have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in themſelves, they taſte and reliſh that in others which they feed upon in themſelves, and wherein the lives of their ſouls do conſiſt; the ſame ſpirit of life be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, they have the ſame ſpiritual taſte and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor. And unleſs their palates are diſtempered by temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or falſe opinion or prejudices, they can in their communion taſte of that ſpirit in each other, which they are all made to drink into. This gives them the ſame likeneſs and image in the inward man, the ſame heavenly light in their minds, the ſame affections; and being thus prepared to judge and diſcern of the ſtates of each other, in reference unto their mutual duties, they have moreover the true rule of the word to judge of all ſpirits and ſpiritual effects by. And this is the ground of all that love without diſſimulation, and real communion
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:010823_0031_0F81D4872A4793F0"/>
that is among the ſaints of God in this world. If theſe are omitted, there is an end of all profitable uſe of church-ſociety. Churches without this, are but mere huſks and ſhells of churches, carcaſes without ſouls; for as there is no real union unto Chriſt without faith, ſo there is no real union among the members of any church without love, and that acting itſelf in all the duties mentioned, let not this ordinance be in vain.</q>

People are ſo far from being under obligation to follow teachers, who don't lead in <hi>this way,</hi> that they incur guilt by ſuch a following of them. The apoſtle <hi>John,</hi> ſpeaking of the <hi>doctrine of Chriſt,</hi> ſays. <hi>If there come</hi> ANY <hi>unto you; and bring not</hi> THIS DOCTRINE, <hi>receive him not into your houſe, nor bid him God ſpeed; for he that biddeth him God ſpeed, is</hi> PARTAKER <hi>of his evil deeds,</hi> 2 John 10.11. And the great apoſtle of the gentiles ſays, <hi>Tho' we or an angel from heaven, preach any other goſpel unto you, than that which we have preached unto you,</hi> (and than, that ye <hi>have received</hi>) <hi>let him be accurſed,</hi> Gal. 1.8, 9. And now, where is the power that is derived by a <hi>local ſucceſſion</hi> from the apoſtles? And which many hold their authority from as miniſters, and carry it ſo high as to <hi>forbid</hi> thoſe who <hi>follow not them,</hi> even tho' the reaſon of it were a matter of conſcience, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they really believed that ſuch miniſters neither prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched nor practiſed agreeable to the goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo far from eſtabliſhing ſuch a <hi>local</hi> power, that, to guard againſt all ſuch pretences, he ſtates the caſe upon the higheſt pitch of all creature authority, viz. <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles</hi> and <hi>angels</hi>: and leaving all <hi>Peter</hi>'s <hi>ſucceſſors</hi> out of the queſtion, he brings it up to the <hi>apoſtles</hi> themſelves, and ſays, <hi>Tho</hi>' WE preach any other goſpel than that <hi>ye have received</hi>; nay, if an <hi>angel</hi> directly <hi>from heaven</hi> ſhould do ſo, <hi>let him he accurſed.</hi> Our modern miniſters would evade all this, by telling us that they don't <hi>pervert the goſpel,</hi> and that 'tis our erroneous <hi>judgments,</hi> or perverſe <hi>will,</hi> that makes us leave them; but <hi>Paul</hi> inſtead of aſſuming any ſuch <hi>dominion</hi> over others <hi>faith,</hi> ſays, <hi>judge ye what I ſay</hi>; and he implicitly charges them to <hi>reject him</hi> if he ſhould come to them with <hi>another goſpel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Should any object that this allowing every one a right to receive or reject miniſters as they judge beſt, will bring miniſters authority to nothing, and ſo deſtroy ſuch an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of men out of the church:</p>
               <p>I reply, that 'tis ſo far from it, that this is the only way to eſtabliſh the goſpel miniſtry, upon its right foundation: for as Chriſt's kingdom is <hi>not of this world,</hi> but its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation

This leads us to view how miniſters come by their authority. When Zion's king aſcended on high, he <hi>gave gifts to man</hi>; a ſpecial part whereof were, <hi>paſtors and teachers; for the perfecting of the ſaints, for the work of the miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. 4.8—12.</note> And his command is, AS EVERY <hi>man hath received the gift, even ſo miniſter the ſame one to another, as good ſtewards of the manifold grace of God.</hi> 
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Pet. 4 10.</note> This natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally opens the way for their being received into office in the church, as <hi>gifts</hi> from her king. <hi>Peter</hi> told the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty diſciples, that of the men which had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with them, all the time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out among them, one muſt be <hi>ordained</hi> to be a <hi>witneſs</hi> with the apoſtles of his reſurrection: accordingly they <hi>gave forth their lots</hi>; and thereby <hi>Matthias</hi> was put into that office. <note n="§" place="bottom">Acts 1.21—26.</note> And after the apoſtles were endowed with extraordinary <hi>power</hi> from on high, to <hi>witneſs</hi> for Chriſt, <note n="‖" place="bottom">ver. 8.</note> yet they did not ſo much as nominate the <hi>ſeven men,</hi> who were to be put into office in their preſence, but ſaid, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, look ye eat among you ſeven men of honeſt report, full of the holy ghoſt and wiſdom, whom we may appoint over this buſineſs.</hi> They did accordingly, and ſet the men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the apoſtles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. Act. 6.3, 6. And in Acts 14.23. which ſpeaks of <hi>ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing elders in every church</hi>; many learned men aſſert, that the word which is tranſlated, <hi>ordained,</hi> ſignifies the <hi>act of the church,</hi> declaring their choice of thoſe elders, by <hi>ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, or liſting up the hands.</hi>

known that the word <hi>elder</hi> in ſcripture, does not always mean perſons in office, either in church or ſtate; but often is uſed only for perſons of ſuperior gifts, age or experience; yea the name, when applied to officers, ſeems to derive its original, from the cuſtom of chuſing ſuch perſons into office; <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <q>Elders among the <hi>Jews,</hi> were the moſt conſiderable perſons for age, experience, and wiſdom, who conſtituted the council of the people; among the <hi>primative chriſtians,</hi> thoſe of the firſt rank in the church were called <hi>elders</hi>

                  </note> and in this very epiſtle the word is plainly uſed in a ſenſe, which does not diſtinguiſh thoſe who are in office from others, 1 Tim. 5.1, 2.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole, I can freely leave it with every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to judge, whether the ſcriptures carry the point a whit further than this, <hi>That leading men in the primitive church, led in ordinations as well as other things.</hi> And who will diſpute that point with any body? Thoſe who hold the power to
<q>conſtitute in office, and to remove from office,</q>
to be intirely in the church, yet always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point leading men, (and ſuch as are in office when they can be conveniently had) to act in and for the church, in ordinations. Much ſtreſs is laid by many, on the terms, <hi>commit thou,</hi> in 2 Tim. 2.2. in order to prove the power of ordination to be inherent in them, who are already in office; but it has been already proved, that the apoſtles themſelves, (even tho' they ſometimes conveyed extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary gifts by laying on their hands, yet) did not pretend to act in ordinations, only in conſequence of the churches act; therefore they properly acted as the churches mouth, in putting men into office, and <hi>charging</hi> them to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful therein: and <hi>Timothy,</hi> and all other leaders, ought to be very careful when they are called to aſſiſt in ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſee that they commit the charge of ſouls, only to <hi>faithful men. Paul</hi> in writing to this ſame perſon, uſeth the ſame words, This <hi>charge</hi> I <hi>commit</hi> unto thee; and, I <hi>give</hi> thee <hi>charge,</hi> as ſynonymous terms, 1 Tim. 1.18. &amp; 6.13. And be the right of ordination where it will, yet this is certain, that the direction is to commit the charge of ſouls to <hi>faithful men</hi>; and none but ſuch can truly be in the goſpel line; and when any <hi>creep in,</hi> under a <hi>ſheeps cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> who are not truly ſuch; when they diſcover by their fruits that they are <hi>falſe</hi> men, our Lord commands his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to <hi>beware of them,</hi> Mat. 7.14, 15.</p>
               <p>Another text which is often advanced to prove that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial power is handed down by an external line from
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:010823_0033_0F81D488B1B75738"/>
the apoſtles, is Mat. 28.18,—20. But I think two things may be ſufficient to evince the abſurdity of conſtruing that commiſſion and promiſe in ſuch a way.</p>
               <p n="1">1. All the promiſes of God, are IN Chriſt Jeſus; and the heirs of promiſe are only ſuch as have <hi>fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hope ſet before us,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.20. Heb. 6.17, 18. How vain then muſt the attempt be, to apply that promiſe to any who have not <hi>fled</hi> to the goſpel <hi>refuge</hi>?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Our Lord connects <hi>precept</hi> and <hi>promiſe</hi> together in the text, <hi>Teaching them to obſerve all things, whatſoever I have commanded you: and lo I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world</hi>: Therefore this promiſe is ſo far from ſupporting a <hi>ſucceſſion</hi> of unconverted miniſters, that it could not ſupport even the apoſtles themſelves, if they turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſide from the line of truth; yea, inſtead of the <hi>promiſe,</hi> the <hi>curſe</hi> would ſeize upon an apoſtle or angel, if they ſhould turn off from the goſpel way, as I have proved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Should any ſay, that thoſe words of <hi>Paul</hi> are <hi>hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical</hi> expreſſions; i. e. ſuppoſing a caſe for illuſtration, which is not granted, for 'tis readily allowed, that they are ſo; but I would have people remember, that 'tis chiefly from ſuch ways of ſpeaking, that they draw their pleas for unconverted miniſters, as from 1 Cor. 13.1—3. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To ſhew that my opinion about a line of ſucceſſion is not ſingular, I will tranſcribe ſome of Dr. <hi>Owen</hi>'s thoughts thereon, which were publiſhed in <hi>London</hi> 1692. in a ſmall piece called, "A guide to church-fellowſhip and order," wherein he ſays, p. 47, 48.
<q>The office of the miniſtry, for the <hi>continuation</hi> of the <hi>church ſtate,</hi> and adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all ordinances of worſhip unto the end of the world, is ſufficiently ſecured, (1.) By the <hi>law,</hi> conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution and appointment of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that office, and giving warranty for its continuance, to the conſummation of all things, Mat. 28.20. Eph. 4.13. (2.) By his continuance according unto his promiſe, to communicate <hi>ſpiritual gifts</hi> unto men, for the miniſterial edification of the church.—(3.) On the duty of believers, or of the <hi>church,</hi> which is, to chuſe, call, and ſolemnly ſet apart unto the office of the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, ſuch as the Lord Chriſt by his ſpirit, hath made meet for it, according unto the rule of his word.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>If all theſe, or any of them do fail, I acknowledge, ſays he, that all <hi>miniſterial authority</hi> and ability for the diſpenſation of goſpel ordinances muſt fail alſo, and conſequently the ſtate of the <hi>church.</hi> And thoſe who

plead for the continuation of a <hi>ſucceſſive miniſtry,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reſpect unto theſe things, without reſolving both the <hi>authority</hi> and <hi>office</hi> of it unto them, do but erect a <hi>dead image,</hi> inſtead of the living and life giving inſtitutions of Chriſt. They take away the <hi>living creature,</hi> and ſet up a <hi>ſkin ſtuffed with ſtraw.</hi>

Thus far Dr. <hi>Owen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Compare this with the opinions of the preſent day. Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> ſays,
<q>Tis true indeed, Jeſus did not go into the <hi>colleges</hi> or ſchools of learning, for his firſt miniſters: nor was there any need of ſuch a ſtep, while Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was perſonally preſent, to educate his ſons. But they, whom he took into his ſchool, were chiefly unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ignorant men: to whom, in a little time, he gave ſuch a meaſure of knowledge, learning and grace, as abundantly qualified them for the great work, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to he appointed them.</q>
p. 15. But now he ſays,
<q>The <hi>ſeparates</hi> having ſhut learning out of doors, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by deprived themſelves of the <hi>beſt means</hi> of obtaining and preſerving the <hi>knowledge</hi> of <hi>pure divine truths.</hi>
                  </q>
p. 169.
<q>Neither do they <hi>know</hi> whether the bible is rightly tranſlated, ONLY as they have it from the <hi>learned.</hi>
                  </q>
p. 167. And he ſays, our holding the whole <hi>power</hi> of <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> to be in the <hi>church,</hi> is
<q>without <hi>any</hi> direction in the whole word of God; and contrary to plain goſpel example. p. 145.</q>
But Men ſays he,

Which occaſioned Mr. <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s publiſhing a ſermon with an appendix, upon Chriſt's <hi>power</hi> and <hi>divinity</hi>; to which Dr. <hi>Sewall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Prince,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Foxcroft,</hi> wrote a preface, wherein they expreſs their hopes that,
<q>By the bleſſing of Chriſt, it may be of excellent ſervice to guard many of the readers, from thoſe moſt dangerous ſuggeſtions againſt his adorable deity, which have been of late unhappily publiſhed, to the great grief and offence of many among us.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>They don't name either the author of book; yet this was the plaineſt teſtimony that was publiſhed among us on that occaſion, as ever I heard of: neither can I learn that Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi> ever retracted that dangerous and fundamental error; yet after he died in July 1766, he was celebrated from the pulpit, and preſs, by many miniſters in town and country, as one of the brighteſt characters among them. Dr. <hi>Chauncy,</hi> who formerly wrote ſo much to try to prove that <hi>New-England</hi> miniſters had not forfeit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their character, by any of their open conduct, publiſhed a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſermon for him, wherein he greatly extols Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi>; and in a note, p. 28. he ſays,
<q>Two or 3 years ago a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet appeared among us under the name of an <hi>obſcure</hi> perſon, without <hi>reputation</hi>;—in which the Dr. was repreſented as an <hi>enemy to the atonement made by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The writer of that piece (ſays Dr. <hi>C.</hi>) knew little of the Dr. or the true meaning of his works. He might as well have taxed <hi>any</hi> mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in the <hi>town</hi> or <hi>province</hi> upon this head.</q>
If I believed Dr. <hi>Chauncy</hi>'s teſtimony in this, I ſhould have a worſe opinion of that order of miniſters than I ever yet had; for I have great reaſon to believe, that Dr. <hi>Mayhew</hi>'s writings, have done the moſt to corrupt peoples minds, and to prejudice them againſt the pure <hi>doctrines of grace,</hi> as they were held by the <hi>fathers</hi> of this country, of any one man in our land.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>obſcure</hi> perſon without <hi>reputation,</hi> which Dr. <hi>C.</hi> refers to, is Mr. <hi>John Cleaveland,</hi> who was expell'd out of <hi>college,</hi> after he had been there about 3 years, only for his attending the worſhip of God, with the church which he was a member of, inſtead of going to hear a <hi>candidate</hi> which the <hi>aſſociation</hi> and the world had ſet up, in oppoſition to the <hi>church.</hi> He wrote againſt two of Dr. <hi>M.</hi> ſermons; and the preſident who expelled him, did himſelf ſo much honor on this occaſion, as to ſend Mr. <hi>Cleave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> a degree of <hi>maſter</hi> of <hi>arts.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </note> For what leſs can be
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:010823_0034_0F81D4897255B630"/>
the import of ſaying, that Chriſt taught and qualified men for the miniſtry, when he was "perſonally preſent," as he cannot or does not do now; what leſs can it be than to ſay, he is not <hi>truly God</hi> by nature, but only ſo by <hi>office,</hi> and that having ſet up officers in his kingdom, he has gone to heaven, and left them to order affairs in his abſence? God has often changed his diſpenſations, but his nature and his grace remain ever the ſame. He inſpired men to write the ſcriptures, and gave them power to <hi>confirm his word</hi> with <hi>diverſe miracles</hi>; which is not neceſſary, ſince the bible is acknowledged to be complete. But 'tis as great a truth now, as ever, that, <hi>No man knoweth the things of God, but the ſpirit of God</hi>; and that each faint has <hi>receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> this ſpirit, that they <hi>might</hi> KNOW <hi>the things that are freely given to them of God.</hi> Yet Mr. <hi>F.</hi> declares that we
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:010823_0034_0F81D4897255B630"/>
don't
<q>know whether we have the <hi>pure divine truths</hi> or not, ONLY as we have it from the <hi>learned.</hi>
                  </q>
Whereas <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>my ſpeech, and my preaching was not with entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words of man's wiſdom, but in</hi> DEMONSTRATION <hi>of the</hi> SPIRIT, <hi>and of power: that your</hi> FAITH <hi>ſhould not ſtand in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.4, 5.11, 12. And <hi>John</hi> ſays, <hi>little children, ye have an uncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the holy</hi> ONE, and <hi>ye</hi> KNOW <hi>all things</hi>; and <hi>the anointing which ye have received of him, abideth in you: and ye need not that any man teach you; but as the ſame anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, teacheth you of all things.</hi> And he expreſsly declares, that <hi>it is the ſpirit of antichriſt</hi> which <hi>denies this.</hi> 1 John 2.18 — 27.</p>
               <p>Then let Mr. <hi>F.</hi> look to it; for he has told us from Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> that the
<q>
                     <hi>beſt</hi> of human nature, if not united to the divine nature, is no better than <hi>ſand</hi> to build the church upon.</q>
p 56. Yea, and he has alſo given it as a clear mark of Chriſt's church, that it always has his <hi>holy ſpirit dwelling in it.</hi> What nonſenſe (if no worſe) then is it, to tell of Chriſt's ſervants deriving their <hi>knowledge</hi> of the truth and <hi>right</hi> to preach it, only from the hands of men? His argument is that,
<q>There is nothing of <hi>inſpiration</hi> in <hi>tranſlating</hi> the bible.</q>
Anſwer, there is as much of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration in that, as there is in <hi>tranſcribing</hi> of it; and how many thouſand times has that been done, before it came to the copy that he has ſeen? and how does he know he has got the <hi>pure truth,</hi> as it was wrote by inſpiration? True proteſtants all confeſs, that the <hi>certain</hi> knowledge of the truth, is attained only by the ſame way in the nature of it, which <hi>Paul</hi> points out for the <hi>unlearned,</hi> to gain it by; even that when truth is rightly delivered in <hi>words eaſy to be underſtood, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all; and thus are the ſecrets of his heart made manifeſt; and falling down on his face, he will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</hi> This is in the midſt of the chapter, which is concluded with a precept which theſe miniſters often remind us of, viz. <hi>Let all things be done decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and in order,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.9, 24, 25, 40. And a main <hi>indecency</hi> and <hi>diſorder</hi> which is therein condemned, is ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the church, in language not eaſily underſtood. And who are more guilty of ſuch <hi>diſorders</hi> than theſe great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to <hi>learning</hi>! And what can be a greater plague to the church, than the ſetting up men for miniſters, who never came to this <hi>knowledge of the truth</hi>?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="unknown:010823_0035_0F81D48AA0B36DF0"/>But here I am checked, for Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays,

               </p>
               <p>A gentleman of conſiderable learning, told me, that he was once diſcourſing this matter with an aged miniſter, not far from Mr. <hi>F.</hi> and aſked him if he ever knew one who had got his <hi>degree</hi> at <hi>college,</hi> denied an approbation, if he ſought it? He replied, that he had known <hi>one</hi>: but upon further enquiry, was forced to confeſs that, <hi>that one</hi> went into another county and got an <hi>approbation</hi> there. In fact, the right of <hi>trying</hi> miniſters, which Chriſt gave to his <hi>church,</hi> and commended her for exerciſing that power, in detecting <hi>falſe</hi> men, (Rev. 2.2.) is now uſurped by the <hi>clergy,</hi> and after they have thus robbed God's people of their right, they charge them with want of a <hi>good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> if they will not be eaſy under ſuch tyranny; and with a want of regard to <hi>truth,</hi> if they ſuggeſt that miniſters don't uſe that power aright.</p>
               <p>I would be far from charging them all with this; for one of Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi>'s brethren of as good credit as he, ſays of many who have taken degrees at college.
<q>Alas, for the <hi>encouragement</hi> they meet with! No ſooner do theſe <hi>light, airy, faſhionable</hi> young men, who evidently <hi>deny, oppoſe</hi> and banter, both publickly and privately, the great ſoul humbling, and Chriſt exalting <hi>doctrines</hi> of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel,

               <p>Before I leave this head, I would inſert a few paſſages ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> who ſays,
<q>Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi> denies unto the people all liberty or ability to choſe their own paſtors, to <hi>judge</hi> what is meet for their own <hi>edification</hi>; what is hereſy, or a pernicious error, and what is not, or any thing of like nature. This is almoſt the ſame with that of the Phariſees, concerning them who admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and followed the doctrine of our Saviour, John 7.49. <hi>This people which know not the law.</hi> — Yet was it <hi>this people</hi> whom the apoſtles directed to choſe out from among themſelves, perſons meet for an evangelical office, Act 6. The ſame people who joined with the apoſtles and elders in the conſideration of the grand caſe concerning the continuation of the legal ceremonies, and were aſſociates with them in the determination of it, Acts 15. The ſame to whom all the apoſtolical epiſtles excepting ſome to particular perſons, were written. — unto whom of all ſorts, it is commanded that they ſhould examine &amp; try the ſpirit of antichriſt and falſe teachers. — 1 John 2, 3. &amp;c. <hi>That people,</hi> who in following ages adher'd unto the faith, and the orthodox profeſſion of it, when almoſt <hi>all the biſhops</hi> were become <hi>Arian</hi> heri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks.—This principle of the reformation, in vindication of the rights, liberties and privileges of chriſtian people,

               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>Yea, ſays Dr. <hi>Owen,</hi> I ſhall not be afraid to ſay, that as the reformation was begun and carried on by this principle: ſo when <hi>this people</hi> ſhall thro' an apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their ignorance, weakneſs and unmeetneſs to judge in matters of religion for themſelves, and their own duty, be kept and debar'd from it; or when thro' their own ſloth, negligence and viciouſneſs, they ſhall be really uncapable to manage their own intereſt in church affairs, as being fit only to be governed, if not as brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, yet as mute perſons, and that theſe things are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the ambition of the clergy, ingroſing all things in the church to themſelves, as they did in former ages, — if the <hi>old popedom</hi> do not return, a <hi>new</hi> one will be erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as bad as the other.</q>

               <p>I leave others to judge how near this comes to our day, with only obſerving, that we have ſeen one who calls him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a <hi>congregational miniſter,</hi> not only claiming great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the church for himſelf and brethren, and judging others hearts; but alſo claiming <hi>infallibility</hi> in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for he concludes his long ſtory of Mr. <hi>Davenport</hi> with theſe words, viz.
<q>Suffer me here, to drop a word of awakening, to all <hi>you</hi> that have ſeparated from our churches, that if <hi>this confeſſion</hi> of Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the truths that <hi>have</hi> been, and <hi>are yet</hi> to be told you, don't convince you that you have been, and ſtill are <hi>deluded,</hi> that is, <hi>deceived</hi> and turned aſide from the way of truth and duty, <hi>in the matter of your ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,</hi> you may, from your <hi>non conviction,</hi> KNOW FOR CERTAIN, not only that you <hi>are</hi> thus <hi>deluded,</hi> but that your <hi>deluſion</hi> is very ſtrong.</q>
p. 128.</p>
               <p>It deſerves particular notice, that this <hi>new infallible</hi> tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal, delivers off the ſentence, as the <hi>old</hi> one uſed to do, from a <hi>fallible</hi> rule; which rule the judge does not ſeem to underſtand very well himſelf; for Mr. <hi>Dapenport's</hi> great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt error was, his aſſuming the power to himſelf to <hi>try</hi> mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, and then his openly "adviſing and urging" people to forſake ſuch as he had condem'd, by a
<q>judgment for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, (in ſeveral inſtances) raſhly, and upon ſlender grounds,</q>
and 'tis expreſsly "<hi>ſuch ſeparations</hi>" that he condemned and retracted; and the wrong which he parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:010823_0036_0F81D48AEC45BD80"/>
obſerved in <hi>exhorters,</hi> was their being "puft up." This is the rule that our new judge gives ſentence upon: and in p. 164. he ſays,
<q>
                     <hi>Stand by thy ſelf, come not near me, for I am bolier than thou,</hi> (Pſal. 65.5.) is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the language of ſpiritual pride; but this was the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of ſeparating from our churches, becauſe (as they ſaid) there were hypocrites in them, which they could commune with.</q>
But I think we may claim liberty of a <hi>review</hi> upon this judgment: for the text ſays nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſeparating <hi>good</hi> men from <hi>bad</hi> ones: others are allowed to be <hi>holy,</hi> but the proud language is, I am <hi>holier</hi> than thou. Now this being the ſtate of the caſe, let us look a little forward, and obſerve that our new judge owns the ſeparates to be
<q>erring brethren, and obliging good neighbours;</q>
yet ſome of his concluding advice to his people is,
<q>Go not after them nor follow them.—How can you, with a good conſcience, after <hi>I have ſhewn you</hi> from <hi>whence</hi> they aroſe, their <hi>principles, ſpirit</hi> and <hi>tendency</hi>? They are <hi>ſeparates</hi>; let them be ſo, let them alone.</q>
p. 191.</p>
               <p>Another article that Mr. <hi>D.</hi> confeſſed was his
<q>follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>impulſes</hi> or <hi>impreſſions,</hi> as a <hi>rule</hi> of conduct, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they came with or without a text of ſcripture; and neglecting to obſerve the <hi>analogy</hi> of ſcripture.</q>
This Mr. <hi>F.</hi> declares to be our caſe, p. 140. and by others, all inſide religion is often treated with contempt under thoſe names; as if none followed unreaſonable <hi>impreſſions,</hi> but thoſe who are zealous in religion; whereas all men are more or leſs guilty of ſuch conduct: therefore I will inſert biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi>'s thoughts thereon, who ſays,
<q>There is a <hi>tyranny</hi> in moſt men's nature, which makes them deſire to ſubdue all others, by the ſtrength of their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding;—this <hi>imperious</hi> temper when it works upon ſubjects of <hi>religion,</hi> finds ſomewhat to raiſe its ſpleen, that was of itſelf imperious enough before; and that which is called <hi>fury</hi> and <hi>rage,</hi> when it is employed in other <hi>diſputes,</hi> comes to be called <hi>zeal,</hi> when it is turned towards the theories that relate to another world. But when we conſider what a ſublime thing <hi>divine truth</hi> is, and what a poor low thing the <hi>mind of man</hi> is, we ſhall ſee cauſe to blunt a little the edge of our ſpirits, if they are too ſharp in ſuch matters. Man is much governed by <hi>fancy,</hi> and fancy follows the texture of the animal ſpirits, which render many more capable of apprehending ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, that are ſome way proportioned to them, and more diſpoſed to follow them; ſo that <hi>temper</hi> prepares men
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:010823_0037_0F81D48BAD2D71E8"/>
for ſome opinions, and prepoſſeſſes them againſt others. With the greateſt part of mankind, <hi>education</hi> is ſo pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful that they are ſcarce ever able to overcome it; and if education and temper have hit together, it will require a very extraordinary elevation to reſcue a man from their force.</q>

               <p n="1">1.

We have proof by various evidences, that ſeveral ſcholars in our colleges, both formerly and laterly, who either wanted a capacity or an inclination for learning, have practiced the getting others to make their <hi>leſſons</hi> for them; and ſo by the uſe of <hi>notes</hi> they learn to <hi>impoſe</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their tutors at college, and upon the people after they come from it.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E are often told that <hi>they which preach the goſpel, ſhould live of the goſpel,</hi> 1 Cor. 9.14. but as often, as many have read this text to others, it ſeems as tho' they had never yet road it to themſelves; for the common <hi>practice</hi> of our land ſays,
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:010823_0038_0F81D48DCFAFE650"/>
"They which preach the <hi>goſpel</hi> ſhall live of the law:" yea, and not the <hi>law</hi> of God, but by the <hi>law</hi> of <hi>man</hi>; and however pious the perſons might be who firſt made the law; I think the evidences that have been before exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, prove that the law in it ſelf is of ſuch a nature, as that which we read of in Pſal. 94.20. For tho' ſome may think that thoſe <hi>ſpoiling of goods,</hi> and <hi>haling men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to priſon,</hi> which we have ſeen, is only an <hi>abuſe</hi> of the law; yet a little reflection may convince them of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, and that the <hi>uſe</hi> of it carries thoſe things in its very nature. The great deſign of the law, is to make all the inhabitants of the town or pariſh, pay what the rulers ſay is their part towards the incumbent miniſters ſupport; and the natural language of all that are attached to that way is,
<q>If others are not <hi>made</hi> to do their part, I will not do mine,</q>
and where all the people <hi>love to have it ſo,</hi> they may get along without ſuch open <hi>violence</hi>: but when any happen to be convinced that the way is wrong, and ſo will not give what is required, they are naturally led to <hi>take it by force.</hi> God ſaid of the prieſts, who practiſed ſo formerly, that their <hi>ſin was very great,</hi> 1 Sam. 2.16.17. And how vain is it, for men to ſay otherwiſe of ſuch practice now?</p>
               <p>Many plead in this caſe, that promiſe to the church, that <hi>Kings ſhall be her nurſing fathers, and Queens her nurſing mothers.</hi> But what an odd ſtory would it be, for any to tell of very <hi>kind parents,</hi> who manifeſted ſuch a <hi>tender</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for their children, that they would <hi>rob</hi> one child of his food, or <hi>caſt</hi> him <hi>into a dungeon,</hi> to uphold another in grandeur! Power muſt be exerted in families or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms to <hi>reſtrain</hi> one perſon or community from <hi>injuring</hi> another; but nothing can bring any to act aright in the performance or ſupport of divine worſhp, but light and truth. Hence when the place and furniture for worſhip, was to be provided in the wilderneſs with coſtly materials; tho' the great lawgiver, could infallibly have preſcribed each mans part by law, if he had been pleaſed ſo to do; yet he took another method. For <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake unto all the congregation of the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſaying, <hi>This is the thing which the Lord commanded, ſaying, Take ye from among you an offering unto the Lord: whoſoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the Lord; gold, ſilver,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Exod.</hi> 35.4, 5. So when the <hi>temple</hi> was to be built, <hi>David</hi> appeared as a <hi>nurſing father</hi> in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſet his <hi>affection</hi> to the houſe of his God, in ſuch a manner,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:010823_0039_0F81D48E9E4A7888"/>
that of <hi>his own proper goods,</hi> he gave thereto, <hi>three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand talents of gold,</hi> and <hi>ſeven thouſand talents of refined ſilver</hi>: and by his inſtruction and example, he moved other fathers and rulers to <hi>offer willingly</hi> for the houſe, above 5000 <hi>talents of gold,</hi> and a 10,000 <hi>talents of ſilver,</hi> beſide great preparations of other materials. 1 Chron. 29.3—7. This was the <hi>method</hi> which was taken to prepare a <hi>place</hi> for worſhip, both in the wilderneſs, and in the promiſed land. And as to the <hi>performance</hi> of worſhip, the conſtant Languague of the divine direction was, that every perſon of all ranks ſhould <hi>bring-his offering,</hi> which God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. And tho' I know but little, yet in all that has been ſaid upon theſe controverſies, I never could ſee any proof from the bible of any allowance of the uſe of <hi>coercive</hi> power, to <hi>compel</hi> any to bring their offering, even under the law, where church and ſtate were one: how much leſs then can it be warrantable under the goſpel, where Chriſt's <hi>kingdom is not of this world</hi>?
<q>Do ye not know, that they which miniſter about holy things, live of the things of the temple? and they which wait at the altar, are partakers with the altar? EVEN SO hath the Lord <hi>ordained,</hi> that they which preach the goſpel, ſhould live of the goſpel. Live or <hi>the goſpel</hi> (as one obſerves) not of the <hi>act of civil authority,</hi> not of a certain bargain made with the people, containing a bond of ſtipulation: but this is the <hi>order of it</hi>; thoſe whom Chriſt ſends, <hi>profit the people,</hi> and the <hi>church becomes bountiful,</hi> and the <hi>fruit</hi> the goſpel produceth maintains the preachers of it.</q>

               <p>Now in order to view this matter in a juſt light, we ſhould know what a goſpel covenant is; and Paul ſays, <hi>They firſt gave their own ſelves to the Lord, and unto us by the will of God.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>I have ſworn, and I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.</hi> The engagement to God is perpetual, and that to one another is conditional, <hi>by the will of God</hi>; which makes it to be as incumbent duty to withdraw from perſons or churches, who are evidently corrupt, and will not be reclaimed, as to walk with thoſe who are not ſo.

But as they were bleſſed with a wonderful work of conviction and converſion among them four years ago, many from neighbouring pariſhes, who had received ſoul-deliverance there, were deſirous of joining to that church, and were accordingly received; which gave ſo great offence that many neighbouring miniſters who own'd it to be a good work, yet have now refuſed communion with Mr. <hi>Cleaveland</hi> and his church, only becauſe they receive members over pariſh lines.

Therefore it is called his <hi>new-command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> The continuation of it amongſt the generality of chriſtians, is but vainly pretended; little or nothing of the reality of it in its due exerciſe is found.

Mr. <hi>Matthew Smith</hi> of <hi>Mansfield,</hi> had preached upon trial, to that church, a conſiderable time, 'till they thought proper to appoint a meeting to ſeek for divine direction, and to proceed to the choice of a paſtor, as they might have clearneſs; and there happened to be ſeveral other teachers preſent, one of which, when the queſtion was aſked about, what ſhould be the <hi>method</hi> of proceeding, in chooſing a paſtor? Anſwered, that if any ſee it to be their lot, they ſhould declare it. But little if any reply was made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and ſoon after, this man fell into a ſtrange frame, and then made the declaration which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſpeaks of: which ſtruck a viſible damp upon the aſſembly, as being an <hi>unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected</hi> thing, and none concurred therewith. And the reſt of the day was ſpent in worſhip, 'till in, or near the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when ſome of the church got into a labour with one of their brethren, upon ſome of his moral conduct, which they judged not to be agreeable to rule: and at length he was brought to confeſs it, which gave as viſible a quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to their minds, as the other declaration had a damp: and a leading brother in the church being much overcome, took hold of Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> (who was expected before to be their miniſter) and told him he was the man to go before them; <note n="*" place="bottom">Here note, this has not been our common <hi>method.</hi>
                  </note> and all concurred therewith: and he was ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Dec.</hi> 10. 1746. and he miniſtred in word and ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to them, 'till the ſpring 1749. Then he went off and left his flock; for which, after various labours with him, he was, by the advice of a council, excommunicated on <hi>July</hi> 20. 1750. as I had the account in a letter from a member of the council ſoon after, which letter is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me.

firſt of paſſing over what Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> has ſaid upon it, without notice; but for ſeveral reaſons I have altered my mind, and concluded to make a few <hi>remarks</hi> upon that part of his book alſo.</p>
            <p>And the firſt remark I ſhall make is, that our author takes the method which many have done before him, and tries firſt to <hi>inflame</hi> peoples natural <hi>paſſions,</hi> and then he is pretty certain to get his argument with them: for he ſays,
<q>The church was always <hi>fond</hi> of her <hi>children,</hi>—And can we now, without <hi>horror,</hi> indulge the thought, either that Chriſt hath caſt them off, of that the church is <hi>become as cruel as the Oſtrich.</hi>
               </q>
p. 28. And having ſpent a whole page in ſuch <hi>exclamations,</hi> he then tells of
<q>fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly arguing the points:</q>
but if the firſt point is gained, that the baptiſts principles are <hi>horribly cruel,</hi> what room can be left for argument in the affair? for who will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to diſpute for ſuch principles? Satan himſelf pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends <hi>kindneſs</hi> and not <hi>cruelty</hi> in his inticements.</p>
            <p>It is ſtrange to ſee how great and good men, have been <hi>blinded</hi> by this ſtratagem. Dr. <hi>Mather</hi> tell us, that Mr. <hi>Elliot</hi> publiſhed an anſwer to Mr. <hi>Norcott</hi> on <hi>baptiſm,</hi> and began it with theſe lines, viz.
<q>The book ſpeaks with a voice of a <hi>lamb,</hi> and I think the author is a <hi>godly</hi> tho' erring <hi>brother</hi>; but he acts the cauſe of a <hi>roaring lion,</hi> who by all crafty ways, ſeeketh to devour the poor <hi>lambs</hi> of the flock of Chriſt.</q>

            <p>The Lord gave this reaſon to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> why they ſhould not oppreſs a ſtranger, viz. <hi>For ye know the heart of a ſtranger, ſeeing ye were ſtrangers in the land of Egypt.</hi> And I find the truth of that word in the preſent caſe; for I have gone thro' the ſame <hi>hurrying</hi> and <hi>darkneſs,</hi> upon this point, which Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi> deſcribes, and thought once that I had got clear of it, in the ſame way; and alſo felt the like <hi>fear</hi> of diſputing with others upon it, that he did. Neither was it any creature that ſtopt me at laſt, from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in that way, No, but in my retired hours, this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was put to my conſcience, (I believe) by him who made me,
<q>where is it, and in what relation to the viſible church do baptized infants ſtand, who are not <hi>regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi>?</q>
This I was not able to anſwer; for it was a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled point with me before (as it was with Mr. <hi>Mitchel</hi>) that none but <hi>new-born</hi> ſouls ought to come to the <hi>Lords-Supper</hi>; and yet <hi>baptiſm</hi> is the firſt ordinance in a <hi>chriſtian profeſſion,</hi> and his notion of a <hi>middle way,</hi> between the church and the world, I could not juſtify: ſo that I found the <hi>mountain</hi> to be on the other ſide of the queſtion; and if Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> or any others could have helped me to an <hi>argument</hi> able to <hi>remove it,</hi> I ſhould have gladly uſed it, rather than to be <hi>turned about</hi> again in this affair; but tho' I ſought diligently, by all means within my reach, for twelve months or more, yet I never could find ſuch an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>The heart knoweth its own bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs</hi>: and none but they who have experienced the like, can tell what I then endured; and inſtead of help from my brethren, they helped to increaſe the burden: for one would ſay, It was my liſtning to the <hi>baptiſts,</hi> that cauſed all this difficulty: while another would be as confident that it was the <hi>fear of men</hi> that kept me from coming out in <hi>believers baptiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Often did I think of <hi>Job's</hi> words, <hi>Were your ſoul in my ſouls ſtead, I could heap words upon you.</hi> I ſee now that the chief thing that held my mind ſo long in ſuſpence, was not diſtinguiſhing as I ought between <hi>men,</hi> and the <hi>rule itſelf.</hi> For when I look'd into the <hi>word,</hi> I could read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers baptiſm plainly, and nothing plainly of bringing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants thereto; but when I turned to look among <hi>men,</hi> ſo many <hi>good</hi> ones would be brought up on one ſide, and <hi>bad</hi> ones on the other, and I ſaw ſo much of a wrong <hi>temper</hi> in my <hi>baptiſt</hi> brethren who had come out lately, that I ſaid

in my heart,
<q>I am afraid there is ſome <hi>ſecret miſchief</hi> in that principle.</q>
And I never could obtain deliverance in this matter, 'till I was brought to <hi>ceaſe from man,</hi> ſo as to leave good men and bad men out of the queſtion, and come to this ſingle point; <hi>Nevertheleſs, what ſaith the ſcripture</hi>?

            <p>He allows the <hi>baptiſts</hi> a place among the <hi>churches of Chriſt,</hi> and that they have
<q>doubtleſs a number of godly perſons among them,</q>
but ſays,
<q>We <hi>muſt think</hi> they are in a grievous error, as to the matter in diſpute between <hi>them</hi> and <hi>us.</hi>
               </q>
p. 96. And he directly repairs to the <hi>promiſe</hi> in Acts 2.39. where he would have us take notice that, "'tis not ſaid that the promiſe <hi>ſhall</hi> be to your children: but the promiſe is to your children," ſo it is, and <hi>as many</hi> as heard the <hi>call, and gladly received the promiſe, were baptized, and the ſame day were added to the church, even ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> And there is not a word of the <hi>baptizing any</hi> but <hi>ſuch,</hi> in the whole context. Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> ſays this would put believers children upon
<q>a <hi>level</hi> with the <hi>heathen,</hi> who alſo ſhall be intereſted in the promiſe, upon <hi>their</hi> believing.</q>
p. 97. And will he pretend that any are intereſted in the promiſe of <hi>remiſſion of ſins</hi> and the <hi>gift of the holy Ghoſt,</hi> beſide true <hi>believers</hi>? He ſays this is the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham</hi>: let it be ſo. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that Chriſt was made a <hi>curſe for us,</hi> that the <hi>bleſſing of Abraham</hi> might come on the gentiles, <hi>through Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; that we might <hi>receive the promiſe of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit thro' faith.</hi> The <hi>bleſſing</hi> comes <hi>thro' Chriſt,</hi> and is <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived</hi> only <hi>by faith.</hi> A few verſes forward <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>The ſcripture hath concluded</hi> ALL <hi>under ſin, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe might be given to them that believe</hi>: and concludes the chapter with ſaying, IF <hi>ye be Chriſt's,</hi> THEN <hi>are ye Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's ſeed, and heirs</hi> ACCORDING <hi>to</hi> THE PROMISE. Gal. 3, 13, 14, 22, 29. <hi>The promiſe,</hi> is of the <hi>gift of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and <hi>abundance of grace,</hi> which is only <hi>received by faith</hi>; how vain then are all the pretences, that <hi>any</hi> are <hi>heirs of
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:010823_0053_0F81D3FE059F06A0"/>
promiſe,</hi> but <hi>believers</hi>? The complaint againſt ſetting all men upon a <hi>level,</hi> in their natural ſtate, is as old as <hi>chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity</hi> itſelf: for the very work of the <hi>meſſenger</hi> who came before Chriſt's face, was to <hi>level</hi> all outward diſtinctions in the world; and nothing was more offenſive to the <hi>Jews</hi> than the freedom which our Lord diſcovered towards <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans and ſinners</hi>; and the <hi>Jews</hi> conceit that they had a better claim to <hi>the promiſe,</hi> than <hi>ſuch perſons,</hi> was the grand obſticle in the way of their <hi>believing in Jeſus</hi>; and ſo was the <hi>bar</hi> that ſhut them out of the <hi>kingdom of heaven.</hi> And what leſs than this are thoſe doing, who conceit that <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural birth,</hi> or any thing <hi>done by creatures,</hi> gives <hi>them</hi> or <hi>theirs</hi> any better claim to that <hi>kingdom</hi> than <hi>other ſinners? Paul</hi> was taught the pernicious effects of that <hi>conceit,</hi> and therefore engaged againſt it with all his might, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> were <hi>all under ſin:</hi> to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> that, <hi>We</hi> ALL <hi>were by nature the children of wrath,</hi> EVEN <hi>as others</hi>; and to the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> (as was juſt obſerved) that <hi>all</hi> were <hi>concluded under ſin, that the promiſe might be given to them that believe.</hi> And the very occaſion of his laboring as he did with the <hi>Galatians</hi> was becauſe of ſome who <hi>deſired to make a fair ſhew in the fleſh,</hi> by introducing the <hi>national</hi> plan under the <hi>chriſtian</hi> name: but tho' <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away</hi> at firſt with this ſcheme; yet he <hi>withſtood them to the face,</hi> and ſhewed them that this was <hi>building again the things which once they deſtroyed</hi>; which <hi>things</hi> he expreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly points out to be the <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>Jews by nature, and ſinners of the Gentiles.</hi> Gal. 2.15.</p>
            <p>What then ſhall we think of Mr. <hi>Fiſh,</hi> who declares that the promiſe
<q>remains in full force to your children, upon <hi>your</hi> becoming <hi>chriſtians, as</hi> it did while <hi>Jews</hi>?</q>
And again that the <hi>goſpel charter,</hi>
               <q>
                  <hi>ſecures</hi> the <hi>bleſſings</hi> of the covenant to children, in the <hi>ſame breath</hi> that it does <hi>to the parents.</hi>
               </q>
p. 31.100. If this is not <hi>build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the <hi>middle wall of partition</hi> between the <hi>children of profeſſors,</hi> and <hi>others,</hi> I deſire to know what is. That <hi>wall</hi> which Chriſt has <hi>broken down,</hi> (Eph. 2.14.) and his apoſtles <hi>deſtroyed</hi> it; yet men have got to building it again. And we are told, that 'tis for very good ends too; one of which is to keep children under
<q>the faithful authorative watch and diſcipline of the church.</q>
p. 99. Theſe are fine <hi>words</hi>; but what is there in it, in our day more than empty words? They tell us of ſome <hi>actings</hi> of this nature in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times, but now they are only great <hi>ſwelling words.</hi>

And he elſewhere diſowns the name of a <hi>half way covenant,</hi> p. 92. therefore they muſt be dealt with as <hi>complete</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: and if they will come into <hi>action</hi> upon this plan, then people will ſee where they are, and no longer be amuſed with the name of <hi>congregational</hi> churches: for this is as truly a <hi>national plan,</hi> as ever was in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Judea</hi>: and then he muſt have his own queſtion returned,
<q>What is like to become of the <hi>cauſe</hi> that brought our pious fore fathers into this land?</q>
            </p>
            <p>In order to ſhew the dreadful effects of our principles, Mr. F. ſays, we not only deprive our children of the chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches watch, but implicitly bid them to <hi>go and ſerve other gods.</hi> This he ſays is the conſequence, "If I am not out in my reaſoning. p. 99. A caveat well put in; for it would make many ſuſpect him to be out of his <hi>reaſon,</hi> as well as out in his <hi>reaſoning,</hi> to ſuppoſe that, the not treating per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons <hi>as</hi> Chriſt's ſervants 'till they gave evidence of their <hi>being</hi> ſuch, implied a <hi>bidding</hi> them <hi>ſerve other gods.</hi>
               <q>Again (ſays he) by denying their children the <hi>covenant</hi> and <hi>ſeal,</hi> they do <hi>eventually</hi> deprive them of the <hi>bible.</hi>— of a <hi>preached goſpel,</hi> and <hi>all appointed</hi> means of grace:</q>
and cites, Rom. 3.1, 2. to prove it and ſays,
<q>Upon the whole, may it not be ſaid, of their church, that it is like a flock without <hi>lambs,</hi> a vineyard without <hi>ſeed,</hi> an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard without a nurſery? &amp;c. p. 100.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I would anſwer theſe queries by putting others. Does <hi>learning</hi> conſiſt in <hi>words</hi> or in ideas? And does not every <hi>huſbandman</hi> know, that <hi>lambs</hi> will become <hi>ſheep,</hi> and a nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, <hi>appletrees</hi> without any other <hi>change</hi> but <hi>natural</hi> growth? and do perſons become Chriſt's <hi>ſheep</hi> in ſuch a way?

As to the bible and other means for converſion, who will ſay that children may not attend thoſe means as well <hi>without</hi> ſprinkling as <hi>with</hi>?

            <p>Many, in order to make out ſome ſingular advantage to baptized infants, will reach forward to another world, and ſay that if they die in infancy they have good hope for them, but for others they have none; unleſs it be from the <hi>uncovenanted mercy</hi> of God.

p. 101.</p>
            <p>Anſwer, It is to be lamented that theſe evils too much prevail in all parts of the land, among all denominations; but I have reaſon to think there is a conſiderable reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on theſe accounts, among the baptiſts lately. O may there be much more! A few conſiderations on <hi>family pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> which I thought duty to publiſh two years ago, were at their deſire printed a <hi>Newport,</hi> and have been kindly received in that <hi>colony</hi>; for which I am bound to give thanks to God. And I hope my fathers and brethren, will yet be more engaged by an agreeable walk, to cut off oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion from them who deſire occaſion, and give evidence to all, that believers baptiſm has no natural tendency to make people neglect the duties of private or public religion: The joining of theſe evils with the very name of a <hi>baptiſt,</hi> has long been an engine to guard peoples minds againſt looking into their true ſentiments; whereas there is no more natural relation between thoſe evils, and our princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple about <hi>baptiſm,</hi> than there is between true <hi>learning</hi> and a <hi>haughty perſecuting</hi> behaviour, which have often been put together on the other hand. <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>Mr. <hi>F.</hi> appears a little more cautious of aſſerting things againſt the baptiſt, than againſt ſeparates. He ſays,

Anſwer, ſeveral who have formerly ſent their ſons to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, have been diſappointed, as the clergy have found means to draw them over to their party; which has diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged others from ſending their ſons. And the baptiſts in general have been ſo much abuſed, by thoſe who boaſt of their <hi>learning,</hi> that 'tis not ſtrange if many were preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt ſuch men; yet they have had ſome that the world calls learned men, from the beginning; and lately have begun a <hi>college</hi> of their own, which bids fair to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe; <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>charter</hi> for it was granted in <hi>February</hi> 1764, by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral court of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> colony: and Mr. <hi>James Manning</hi> of <hi>Warren,</hi> is now preſident thereof.</note> but I hope they may never imagine to confine Chriſt or his church, to that, or any other human ſchool, for miniſters.</p>
            <p>In order to ſhew how poorly furniſhed our churches are with <hi>teachers,</hi> Mr. <hi>F.</hi> tells a ſtory of his converſing with one of them, who held that thoſe words, <hi>Drink ye all of it,</hi> proved that they muſt eat and drink <hi>up all</hi> the elements, that are ſet apart for the <hi>Lord's-ſupper</hi>: and repreſents it as the <hi>common practice</hi> among our churches. p. 101. In anſwer to this. I can tell him truly, that I have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a great part of the <hi>baptiſt</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> theſe 18 years, from <hi>Connecticut</hi> river to <hi>Piſcataqua,</hi> and I never heard of ſuch a <hi>practice</hi> among <hi>any</hi> of them, 'till I heard it from his book: therefore I leave him to inſtruct or correct his acquaintance, but I would have him get more <hi>learning,</hi> before he attempts again to reproach thoſe he don't know.</p>
            <p>Having given ſuch an account of the baptiſt, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, that many <hi>good things</hi> are <hi>loſt,</hi> and no good thing gained by going over to them, unleſs theirs is the <hi>only ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural mode.</hi> Upon this he ſays,
<q>Let us <hi>impartially</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine the ſcripture.</q>
p. 102. And he goes on to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the text, that ſpeaks of our Lord's going <hi>out of the water,</hi> ſo <hi>impartially,</hi> that he ſays,
<q>This text affords not the <hi>leaſt ſhadow</hi> of proof for <hi>plunging.</hi>
               </q>
p. 105. This concluſion he draws from Mat. 4.25. and Luke 2.4. where the word <hi>apo,</hi> is tranſlated, <hi>from</hi>

               </gap> from whence he concludes that the other text means no more than <hi>from</hi> the water. Now let us not jeſt with ſcripture, but we'll ſuppoſe a <hi>critick,</hi> like our author, had been at <hi>New-London</hi> when he came there to get his book printed, and had aſked, whence it came? and he had replied, <hi>From</hi> Stonington.

            <p>If this be the learning which Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſpeaks ſo much of, he is welcome to it all: yet after he has ſpent eight pages in this <hi>impartial</hi> examination, (wherein he ſays,
<q>We chooſe the mode of <hi>ſprinkling</hi> or <hi>waſhing</hi> as moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent,</q>
p. 110) he concludes that he has
<q>made it appear, <hi>beyond contradiction,</hi> that <hi>plunging</hi> in baptiſm, is no ways <hi>eſſential</hi>:</q>
and ſays they are,
<q>
                  <hi>fairly</hi> licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,—even by thoſe very texts (as they ſtand in the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal) upon which they rely.</q>
p. 111.</p>
            <p>I confeſs it might ſeem ill manners, to proceed in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, after a perſon is <hi>fairly ſilenced</hi>; yet I remember they uſed to allow the <hi>Indians</hi> to aſk queſtions, after they had been preaching to them: I ſhall therefore take that liberty.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> I would aſk this teacher how he came to act as he ſays we <hi>learned enemies,</hi> who <hi>make havock of the church,</hi> do? whoſe language according to his own account, p. 176, is,
<q>You don't rightly underſtand your bible: 'tis <hi>thus</hi> and <hi>ſo</hi> in the <hi>original</hi>; the meaning of <hi>this</hi> and <hi>that</hi> text, is not as you take it; but juſt the reverſe, or very different.</q>
He aſks whether we muſt not run back to the <hi>ſtanding churches</hi> for help in ſuch a caſe? I believe not; but I will tell him what I have once done. When the miniſters of <hi>Norwich</hi> and one from <hi>Preſton,</hi> joined and made ſome <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi> to Mr. <hi>Dickinſon's dialogue,</hi> and got it reprinted, I ſent one of them to Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> who had anſwered the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue before; but when he obſerved that they have added in page 5, that "St. <hi>Irenaus,</hi> who lived about 14 years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Chriſt; —ſays in his epiſtle ad Rom. lib. 5.
<q>The church received a tradition from the apoſtles, to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter baptiſm to little children or infants.</q>
The doctor ordered an advertiſement to be inſerted at the end of one of his books, wherein, after mentioning this paſſage, he
<q>
                  <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges</hi> it as a <hi>forgery,</hi> there being <hi>no ſuch paſſage</hi> in all the works of <hi>Irenaeus</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Gill</hi> defies the above gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, and the whole literary world to produce or point out, <hi>any</hi> ſuch paſſage in <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> or <hi>any</hi> book or chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his, of ſuch a title, in which this pretended paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage is ſaid to be.</q>
And with this, he ſent me another book, wherein he declares to the world, that all the <hi>Greek Lexicons</hi> which he ever ſaw make the primary ſenſe of the word <hi>baptize,</hi> to be to <hi>dip</hi>; and to <hi>waſh</hi> by conſequence:
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:010823_0056_0F81D40034246F38"/>
but that it never means to <hi>pour</hi> or <hi>ſprinkle</hi>; and if there are any <hi>lexicons</hi> which give a different ſenſe of the word, he deſires they may be pointed out.</p>
            <p>A <hi>ſecond</hi> queſtion I would aſk is, how our author and his brethren came to depart in this caſe, from the general rule, of <hi>interpreting obſcure</hi> places by thoſe which are plain? It is well known that the meaning of words is moſt plain, where they are uſed in their <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, and commonly, but part of their meaning is refer'd to, when uſed in a <hi>figurative</hi> way. As for inſtance, the metaphor of a <hi>thief,</hi> and of an <hi>unjuſt judge</hi> is refer'd to by our Lord, to ſhew the <hi>ſuddenneſs</hi> of his coming, and the <hi>prevalence</hi> of <hi>impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity</hi>: but what blaſphemer will dare to apply the whole meaning of thoſe words either to the Father or to the Son? yet in the caſe before us, all arts are uſed to <hi>darken</hi> texts which ſpeak of <hi>baptiſm</hi> in the <hi>literal</hi> ſenſe, and then we are turned to places where the word is uſed in a <hi>figurative</hi> way, in order to decide its true meaning. The <hi>overwhelming</hi> ſorrow of Chriſt; and his diſciples being <hi>filled</hi> with the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, are called <hi>baptiſms</hi>; and Mr. <hi>F.</hi> would point us only to the <hi>way</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of its <hi>coming,</hi> and not to their being <hi>filled</hi> or <hi>overwhelmed</hi> therein, and then ſays,
<q>There was <hi>nothing</hi> in either of thoſe <hi>baptiſms,</hi> that ſo much as <hi>look'd like dipping.</hi>
               </q>
p. 107. What! <hi>nothing like it</hi>! when in a plain prophecy of Chriſt, 'tis ſaid, <hi>The waters are come in unto my ſoul;— I am come into deep waters, where the floods</hi> OVERFLOW <hi>me,</hi> Pſalm 69.1, 2. Thus he denies what <hi>is</hi> in the bible; but at other times would have us read what never <hi>was</hi> there: for in the ſame page he refers us to Mr. <hi>Dickinſon's</hi> dialogue, who in ſpeaking of <hi>Iſrael's</hi> being <hi>baptized</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> leaves out all the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of their going <hi>into,</hi> and coming <hi>out of,</hi> the ſea, and having the waters on <hi>each hand,</hi> and the cloud <hi>over them</hi>: I ſay, he leaves all theſe out, and then tells us of
<q>rain from the cloud,</q>
which the bible ſpeaks nothing of. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>My <hi>third</hi> queſtion is this; Can they find one inſtance that God ever inſtituted an ordinance without ſhewing the <hi>manner</hi> how it ſhould be perform'd? will they ſay that Chriſt appointed the <hi>matter</hi> of the ordinance of the ſupper to be bread and wine, but left the church to <hi>decree rites and ceremonies</hi> concerning the <hi>manner</hi> of its performance? The initiation ordinance of the jewiſh church was a <hi>bloody</hi>
               <pb n="112" facs="unknown:010823_0057_0F81D400EA541EE0"/>
ſign, and the learned tell us that it took its name from the <hi>manner</hi> of its performance, as the word <hi>circumciſion</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies "to cut all round." <note n="*" place="bottom">Cruden's Concordance at the word circumci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I preſume none will ſay it would. Neither (I believe) will they pretend, that cutting any other part of the body would have done beſide the <hi>foreſkin.</hi> And who will venture to contradict the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſay, Jeſus was <hi>leſs faithful</hi> than <hi>Moſes,</hi> in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the orders of his houſe?

            <p>And let me aſk thoſe who hold that if <hi>water</hi> is uſed in the ſacred name 'tis baptiſm, tho' it be done by <hi>ſprinkling</hi> or <hi>pouring,</hi> whether they think <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood what he ſaid when he calls baptiſm a <hi>burial</hi>? Rom. 6.4, 5. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> ſays,
<q>It is moſt evident that this text has no reference at all to,—any particular <hi>mode</hi> of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtring that ordinance, but the plain manifeſt ſcope of the words, is to ſhew us our <hi>obligation</hi> by <hi>baptiſm,</hi> unto a conformity to the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, by <hi>dying unto ſin,</hi> and <hi>riſing again unto newneſs of life.</hi>
               </q>
Anſwer, 'tis readily granted that this is his ſcope; but do they ſuppoſe that learned <hi>Paul</hi> had ſuch a ſcope with him as to uſe <hi>words</hi> without any reference to their true <hi>mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>? Common people know, that when they <hi>bury</hi> a man they never expect to ſee him return to his <hi>old way of living</hi> again; and that when they <hi>plant</hi> corn they expect its next appearance will be by a <hi>new growth</hi>: and how ſtricking from hence is the argument to engage <hi>baptized</hi> believers to walk in <hi>newneſs of life</hi>? But now, forſooth, <hi>Paul</hi> muſt be thought to apply the words <hi>buried</hi> and <hi>planted</hi> to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, when <hi>ſprinkled</hi> and <hi>waſhed,</hi> would have done as well or better! ſuch advances have men made in <hi>learning</hi> ſince <hi>Paul's</hi> day!</p>
            <p>Before we leave this point, I would aſk theſe learned gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen how they came to know which <hi>part</hi> of the body they ſhould apply water to? Circumciſion was in a <hi>ſecret part,</hi> and they often tell us that baptiſm comes in its room. If <hi>waſhing</hi> be baptiſm, Jeſus <hi>waſhed</hi> his diſciples <hi>feet,</hi> but I don't read that he waſhed their <hi>face</hi>: how then did they come to know that <hi>ſprinkling</hi> the <hi>face</hi> was baptiſm?</p>

               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:010823_0057_0F81D400EA541EE0"/>However I muſt ſtand no longer here, for Mr. <hi>F.</hi> ſays, to be <hi>conſiſtent,</hi> we muſt

p. 96. Here then, if we will take his word for it, he and his brethren have much more <hi>charity</hi> than the poor <hi>rigid</hi> baptiſts: but as this has long been an engine to keep people in darkneſs, I ſhall, as help may be offered, freely and diſtinctly give my thoughts upon it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What do men mean by <hi>unchurching</hi> others? <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>every man fully perſuaded in his own mind</hi>; and act accordingly, ſo as not to <hi>condemn himſelf in that thing which he alloweth.</hi> And he ſhews, that he which <hi>doubteth</hi> whether a thing be right or not, and yet does it, is <hi>damned</hi> or <hi>condemned</hi> therefor. Rom. 14.5, 22, 23. Yet modern <hi>charity</hi> will <hi>condemn</hi> all who dare to think and act contrary to the eſtabliſhed religion. Every ſoul that ventures to ſee with its own eyes; ſo far as they diſcover and act upon truth, they like <hi>Noah</hi> do therein condemn all the world who act contrary thereto; which renews the old complaint, <hi>Thou reproacheſt us alſo.</hi> And what then? Mr. <hi>F.</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns us as much as we do him. No, ſays he, we are not <hi>obliged</hi> nor <hi>diſpoſed</hi> to treat them with like <hi>ſeverity:</hi> but if we read on, we ſhall find he has told the world that he has proved <hi>beyond contradiction</hi> that we are wrong, and has <hi>fairly ſilenced</hi> us, and therefore has warned all not to hear us any more: and what ſeparate or baptiſt in <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> has done more or ſo much as this towards unchurch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other ſect whatſoever?</p>

And is not our author ſomewhat <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with himſelf, while he is telling what we muſt do to be <hi>conſiſtent</hi>? for he tells abundance of what <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> teachers we have; and yet anon they are ſo <hi>crafty</hi> that he durſt not venture his people to go near them, leſt they ſhould be <hi>deceived</hi> by them. Therefore, 2. Does not the core of all this difficulty lie in this, that common people claim as good a right to judge and act for themſelves in matters of religion, as civil rulers or the learned clergy? It has a <hi>ſhew</hi> both of <hi>wiſdom</hi> and <hi>humility</hi> to appoint thoſe who know more than we do, to judge and act for us; and it has more than a ſhew of them, often to do ſo in temporal things: but in religion it is a moſt dangerous ſnare. Fathers have a right to ſee and act for their children in many caſes; but in this matter Jeſus ſays, <hi>call</hi> NO <hi>man your father upon the earth.</hi> Mat. 23.9. And <hi>Paul</hi> ſpends a whole chapter in labours to expoſe and guard againſt this very ſnare. Col. 2. He ſpeaks highly of the <hi>order</hi> of that church, and of the <hi>ſtedfaſtneſs</hi> of their <hi>faith in Chriſt,</hi> and exhorts them to <hi>walk in him</hi> AS they <hi>received him.</hi> And all ſaints know that when they received Chriſt, they had no creature to ſee for them, but each ſoul acted as ſingly towards God, as if there had not been another perſon in the world: well ſays the apoſtle, <hi>So walk in him: rooted and built up in him, and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the faith,</hi> AS YE <hi>have been taught, abounding there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with thanksgiving.

            <p>It was God's expreſs command, that three times in the year all the males in his antient church, ſhould appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; the laſt of which times was at the feaſt of <hi>taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles,</hi> which took its name from the <hi>mode</hi> which he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be kept in, viz.

As the baptiſts are often repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as the moſt <hi>rigid</hi> of all ſects, I will briefly touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome plain evidences to the contrary. The reader may remember how ſhockingly Mr. <hi>Robbins</hi> of <hi>Branford</hi> was treated by the <hi>conſociation</hi> for his preaching among the <hi>baptiſts.</hi> And tho' the ſeparates ſet out, and for ſome years practiſed free communion with the baptiſts, and the bars were broken down, ſo that they were admitted to free and ſucceſsful labors in many baptiſt ſocieties, and they went on comfortably together, 'till by this freedom many were brought into ſuch an acquaintance with the baptiſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as to embrace and practice them; yet that made a great difficulty, and ſeveral were cenſured by churches and councils, for leaving infant baptiſm: upon which many at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were made for accommodation, 'till at length a bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt elder refuſed to act in an ordination with an elder of the other denomination, becauſe he thought that elder had in ſeveral inſtances injured the baptiſts and their principles. This cauſed hard contention between the two elders, and they joined and called all theſe churches together, to hear the affair: which was the largeſt meeting we ever had ſince the beginning of the ſeparation.</p>
            <p>The meeting was at <hi>Stonington</hi> on May 29, 1754, where the meſſengers of about 35 churches came together; and labored in conference upon theſe affairs three days; and in the cloſe of the meeting, ſeveral of the moſt noted leaders on the ſide of the paedo-baptiſts openly declared that tho' they could yet commune with ſaints who did <hi>not ſee</hi> light for infant baptiſm; yet they did withdraw the hand of fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip from all ſuch as profeſſed <hi>to ſee</hi> that there was no warrant for bringing infants to that ordinance. And thus the breach appeared before the world to be on that ſide.</p>

In our former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes concerning baptiſm, I heard one advance it as a motive to embrace the baptiſt principles, that thereby providence had opened a door for a releaſe from a burden of taxes: and the ſame day I heard another of equal note ſay, The baptiſt principles might be right, and he did not know but he ſhould conform to them if he liv'd among them, but it would not do to make an <hi>overturn</hi> about it among us.

            <p>And whenever the power of God is remarkably diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to turn men from darkneſs to light, and from the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſatan unto God; a loud noiſe is ſoon raiſed about <hi>diſorders, deluſions</hi> and <hi>imprudencies</hi>; and all arts are uſed to blind peoples minds, and to ſettle them back into carnal ſecurity again. And no ſtratagem of the enemy has been more ſucceſsful, than to mix and confound error with truth, in chriſtians experiences, converſation, and conduct: and when their corruptions are diſcovered, ſinners and hypocrites catch at them: for God ſays, They <hi>eat up</hi> the <hi>ſin</hi> of <hi>my people,</hi> and they <hi>ſet their heart on their iniquity</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Hoſ. 4.8. And the deſtroyer of ſouls would perſuade them, that there is nothing in religion: or if there is ſome reality therein, yet that common people can't diſcern the difference, and therefore muſt be directed by ſuch as know better than they. In order to accompliſh this end, many who would be thought to know much, have often pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcern diſtinctions, where others can ſee no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; while things which are really diſtinct in their nature, are confounded together. This wickedneſs has been as wretchedly practiſed by ſome, under the pretence of <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual teaching,</hi> as it has by others under the name of <hi>great learning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is a fact not to be diſputed, that ſome men know more, and ſee further than others do, both in natural, and in ſpiritual things; but when real or pretended knowledge, is uſed to keep others in ignorance, and to excite a high opinion of themſelves, inſtead of laboring to enlighten and benefit others; that is a certain token of ſuch perſons being enſnared by, if they are not under the full power <hi>of,</hi> the <hi>wiſdom</hi> which is <hi>from beneath.</hi> For when there was much
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:010823_0062_0F81D406309299D0"/>
murmuring among the common people, concerning HIM who ſpake as no mere man ever did: ſome ſaying <hi>He is a good man,</hi> others ſaying, <hi>Nay, but he deceiveth the people</hi>: He was ſo far from checking their attempt to form a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſuch matters, that he gave them an infallible rule to judge upon: viz. <hi>He that ſpeaketh of himſelf, ſeeketh his own glory: but he that ſeeketh his glory that ſent him, the ſame is true, and no unrighteouſneſs in him.</hi> John 7.18, But as thoſe who have a <hi>right</hi> to judge, yet many times don't judge <hi>right</hi>; therefore he lays down two important leſſons in the affair. One is, not to act as unconcerned <hi>ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators,</hi> but as perſons really engaged to <hi>practice</hi> what they know. <hi>If any man will</hi> DO <hi>his will, he ſhall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I ſpeak of myſelf.</hi> The other leſſon is, not to <hi>judge</hi> in a ſuperficial manner, by the <hi>appearance</hi> and ſhew which is made, but to <hi>judge righteous judgment</hi>; to ſearch carefully into the truth and reality of things.</p>
            <p>Thus the ſon of God plainly held forth the right which common people ever have to judge, both of the <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>conduct</hi> of <hi>teachers</hi>; and the <hi>meek he will guide in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> while thoſe who receive not the <hi>love of the truth,</hi> but have <hi>pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs,</hi> are conſtantly expoſed to be given over to <hi>ſtrong deluſions.</hi> This being the <hi>order</hi> of Chriſt's kingdom; hence ſee what a <hi>diſorder</hi> it makes, when common chriſtians are denied the free liberty of examining their teachers, and of acting according to their judgments in the affair; and alſo that 'tis a great <hi>diſorder</hi> to condemn and reproach any teachers, only becauſe they are not owned by <hi>rulers</hi> or <hi>learned miniſters</hi>: for by this very rule, our glorious Lord was condemned as a <hi>deceiver,</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers ſtigmatized as <hi>ignorant curſed people,</hi> by men who were as famous in the world's eſteem, for <hi>learning, devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and <hi>order,</hi> as any in our day, ver. 47—49. Nor is the <hi>diſorder</hi> leſs on the other hand, when any under a pretence of <hi>ſpecial teachings,</hi> and <hi>divine influence,</hi> croud their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements upon thoſe who are not edifyed thereby, and plead their right ſo to do, becauſe they ſee further than others, who they ſay can't diſcern where they are: tho' (it may be) ſerious chriſtians <hi>do ſee</hi> them at the ſame time, conduct in a <hi>fleſh-pleaſing</hi> way, and even not providing things <hi>honeſt in the ſight of men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some ſuch <hi>ſpots</hi> and <hi>blemiſhes</hi> have cauſed the greateſt diſorders that I have ever known among any of our chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches;
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:010823_0062_0F81D406309299D0"/>
and a principal reaſon of ſome ſuch perſons being left to go on, ſo far as they have in ſuch a way, was a fear in humble ſouls of ſpeaking evil (as many have done) of <hi>things they know not</hi>: and we ought always to be cautions in that reſpect, for 'tis like ſhooting in the dark, where we may be as likely to wound a friend as an enemy. What we know to be right, we ought to own, and to diſown what we know to be wrong, and leave other things 'till they are opened to us.

            <p>It is an important part of <hi>goſpel order,</hi> to have every member encouraged in the improvement of the gifts which are given them; but for any to pretend, they have got ſo far out of ſight of the leaſt ſaint, either by human or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine teachings, that the ſaint can't underſtand them, when they properly improve their gifts, is as abſurd as to tell of a <hi>candle ſhining ſo bright as not to give light unto all that are in the houſe.</hi> Mat. 5.15.

By <hi>Iſaac Foſter,</hi> V.D.M. paſtor of a church in <hi>Stafford.</hi>
               </q>
Wherein my name is mentioned, and a few ſtrokes are giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en upon my <hi>letter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Lord.</hi> I ſhall therefore add a brief reply thereto in this place. His text is, 1 Cor. 7.14. Tho' there is nothing ſaid of <hi>baptiſm</hi> in the text or context; and all the argument turns only upon the term <hi>ſanctified</hi> and <hi>holy</hi>: which words are uſed in three ſenſes in ſcripture. As 1. For <hi>internal</hi> and ſpiritual purity. 2. For the <hi>exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> conſecration and ſetting apart of perſons or things to divine worſhip. In this ſenſe the <hi>whole nation</hi> of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were <hi>holy,</hi> as they were ſet apart from all other nations to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e God's church; and ſo the <hi>place</hi> and <hi>furniture</hi> for worſhip among them were <hi>holy,</hi> being <hi>devoted</hi> to that uſe, in diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from all their common enjoyments. 3. Theſe words are ſometimes uſed for the <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>free uſe</hi> of creature comforts, which God grants to his ſaints, while they are going on in a life of <hi>devotedneſs</hi> to him. Thus in a plain prophecy of goſpel privileges and bleſſings it is ſaid, <hi>In that day, ſhall there be upon the bells of the horſes, holineſs unto the Lord;—Yea, every pot in Jeruſalem and in</hi> Judah <hi>ſhall be holineſs unto the Lord of hoſts,</hi> Zech. 14.20, 21. Which words I ſuppoſe intend the ſame thing that <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſed, in this very epiſtle, (after he had declared that thoſe things were <hi>lawful</hi> to chriſtians which were <hi>unclean</hi> to the Jews,) <hi>Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> 1. Cor. 10.31. So he ſays in 1 Tim. 4<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>4, 5. <hi>Every creature of God is good,—for it is ſanctified by the word of God, and prayer,</hi> i. e. His word gives chriſtians a <hi>warrant</hi> to take them, and by prayer they receive a <hi>bleſſing</hi> in the uſe of them.</p>
            <p>Now in my letter to Mr. <hi>Lord,</hi> I gave it as my mind, that this third ſenſe of the words <hi>ſanctified</hi> and <hi>holy,</hi> was the true intent of them in the text before us: and that the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> writing to the apoſtle upon this affair (ver. 1.) was doubtleſs occaſioned by their reading in Ezra 10.3. That the <hi>Jews</hi> were obliged to <hi>put away all the wives, and ſuch as was born of them,</hi> which they had taken of other nations, that were not of their religion: which might na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally cauſe an enquiry, whether they muſt do ſo now or not? And the anſwer is in the negative, for the unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mate is <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and their children <hi>holy.</hi> And Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> entirely concurs with my ſenſe of the occaſion of the words, and alſo as to the meaning of the word <hi>ſanctified</hi>; but he would have the word <hi>holy</hi> taken in the ſecond ſenſe which was given above; and the only reaſon that he gives
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:010823_0063_0F81D406E9BFBE80"/>
for differing from me in that reſpect p. 8. is,
<q>That the unbelieving party is not ſaid to be ſanctified in relation to God but only in relation to the believing yoke-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</q>
But he ſays, children are holy,
<q>not in relation to any other but God only.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which I would obſerve, that 'tis very evident in the text, that the childrens being holy, is the <hi>effect</hi> of the parents being ſanctified, ſo that here we are preſented with a number of abſurdities. As 1. an <hi>effect</hi> which riſeth above its <hi>cauſe.</hi> 2. With a caſe of conſcience, which was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by a text in <hi>Ezra,</hi> that obliged the <hi>Jews</hi> to put away their <hi>wives,</hi> and ſuch as were <hi>born of them,</hi> as <hi>equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean</hi>; and yet the anſwer to it is declared, to mean ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>higher</hi> in the child than in the parent it ſprang from. For Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> ſays, the unbelieving parents being
<q>deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the ſanctifying graces of the holy ſpirit of God, are unfit for communion with him.</q>
p. 5. Yet in the ſame page after ſaying,
<q>The children of believers are as others, born in ſin, and by <hi>nature</hi> children of wrath;</q>
he goes on to ſay,
<q>They are viſibly ſanctified, being ſet apart for God:</q>
and declares,
<q>It is ſuch a ſanctification or holineſs as is intended, when the church and people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> are called holy; Pſal. 50.5. Gather my <hi>ſaints</hi> together unto me, thoſe that have made a covenant with me by ſacrifice.</q>
Here <hi>old ſinners</hi> are declared to be <hi>unfit</hi> for communion with God, while 'tis aſſerted that <hi>young ones</hi> who are <hi>born in ſin,</hi> are ſet apart for him! 3. We have a <hi>ſelf-contradiction</hi>; for in p. 4. Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Ezra 10.3. ſays,
<q>'Tis juſt that thoſe actions that are done againſt <hi>law,</hi> ſhould be accounted not only <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful,</hi> but <hi>null.</hi>—But it was otherwiſe with thoſe to whom the apoſtle wrote; for they were <hi>lawful</hi> man and wife; their marriage not being <hi>prohibited,</hi> they might not be <hi>parted,</hi> and their children not unclean, but holy.</q>
Yet in page 7 when he is oppoſing Dr. <hi>Gill,</hi> he ſays,
<q>The queſtion propounded by the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> was not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a believing huſband and unbelieving wife, were <hi>lawful</hi> man and wife together? No body <hi>doubted that.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>However I will not waſte paper, nor abuſe the reader with remarks upon all the ſtuff which his ſermon abounds with; but would juſt obſerve, that the new-teſtament cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly gives the ſame ſenſe of theſe terms, <hi>ſanctified</hi> and holy, elſe where, as we do here; and thoſe who give the other ſenſe of them are forced, all of them, to borrow it from the <hi>national church</hi> in the old teſtament; and Mr.

               <hi>Forſter</hi> ſays,
<q>I freely own that I know no other difference, betwixt a national church and a congregational church, but one is great, and the other little.</q>
p. 20. If all would come out ſo plain, we ſhould hope to ſee the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy ſoon brought to an iſſue: for the firſt conſtitution of the national church, in <hi>Abraham's houſhold,</hi> is very expreſs; the <hi>covenant</hi> included every <hi>man-child</hi> that was <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rn in his houſe, and bought with his money of the ſtranger.</hi> Theſe were all in that covenant, and therefore were to have the <hi>token</hi> of it adminiſtred upon them. <hi>Circumciſion</hi> did not bring them into covenant; natural birth or purchaſe brought them in, and being in, if there was one ſoul of them that continued without the token of the covenant, God ſaid, <hi>That ſoul ſhall be cut off from his people: he hath broken my covenant.</hi> Gen. 17.13, 14, 27. And when the <hi>paſſover</hi> was inſtituted in that church, the Lord ſaid, <hi>every man's ſervant that is bought for money, when thou haſt cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed him,</hi> THEN <hi>ſhall he eat thereof.</hi> Exod. 12.44.</p>
            <p>No words could be more plain than theſe are, to deſcribe the exact limits of the national church; yet Mr. <hi>Dickinſon</hi> aſſerts, that the patent ſealed by baptiſm, is
<q>The very ſame <hi>parchment</hi> that was given to <hi>Abraham</hi>:</q>
and Mr. <hi>Fiſh</hi> and <hi>Foſter</hi> concur in the ſame ſenſe. But if ſo, then out of their own mouths they are condemned; for inſtead of excluding <hi>half</hi> the ſubjects, as they tell us of, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude more than a <hi>hundred</hi> to <hi>one. Abraham,</hi> before this, had 118 ſervants, <hi>born in his own houſe,</hi> who were fit for <hi>ſoldiers.</hi> Gen. 14.14. And <hi>in the ſelf-ſame day</hi> that this covenant was made with him, he <hi>circumciſed his ſon</hi> and ALL <hi>the</hi> MEN <hi>of his houſe.</hi> Here was but <hi>one</hi> of his <hi>own ſeed</hi> to ſuch a great <hi>houſhold,</hi> (but now their plea is, only for little children.) And if we view the antitype, we may ſee as plain a deſcription of the goſpel church. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that Chriſt had <hi>broken down the middle wall of partition between</hi> them and the <hi>Jews,</hi> and came and <hi>preached peace</hi> to both, whereby their <hi>enmity was ſlain</hi>; and <hi>thro' him they both had acceſs by one ſpirit unto the Father,</hi> and were <hi>fellow-citizens with the ſaints, and of the</hi> HOUSHOLD OF GOD; <hi>and were built upon the foundation of the apoſtles and prophets, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner-ſtone,</hi> Eph. 2.14—20</p>
            <p>Now if Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> knows of no other difference between theſe two churches but only what reſpects their <hi>number,</hi> I would deſire him to go to ſchool with <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> and learn the difference betwixt being <hi>born of the fleſh,</hi> and a being
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:010823_0064_0F81D409B36E4280"/>
               <hi>born of the ſpirit.</hi> In my letter, I had obſerved that the <hi>oracles of God</hi> were <hi>committed to the Jews,</hi> and many means were uſed for the converſion of members <hi>within</hi> the church: whereas now, the goſpel is freely <hi>preached to all nations,</hi> and the <hi>lively ſtones,</hi> which are the materials of this <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual houſe,</hi> which is the antitype of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s temple, are <hi>prepared without,</hi> before they are <hi>builded together for an habitation of God thro' the ſpirit.</hi> Upon which Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> gives ſeveral cants, and ſays, he knows not what I mean, unleſs it is, "That there is now no means
<q>uſed for the converſion of members within the church.</q>
p. 21.</p>
            <p>But if the obſerving this difference, that the means for converſion were <hi>confined within</hi> the <hi>jewiſh</hi> church, which are now <hi>freely uſed</hi> with others who are <hi>without</hi> the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an church, can convey <hi>no other</hi> meaning in it, than that there are <hi>no means</hi> uſed for converſion within this church; then I deſpair of ever conveying any juſt ideas to mankind I However, when we ſee how this man leaves his own mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we ſhall not wonder at this treatment of others; for upon my ſaying that <hi>Paul</hi> takes much pains to keep <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's</hi> natural and ſpiritual ſeed diſtinct, he ſays,
<q>
                  <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> never had a ſpiritual ſeed, nor no other man, the man Jeſus Chriſt excepted.</q>
p. 24. And leaves it ſo. Now whether he thinks, <hi>Oneſimus</hi> whom <hi>Paul</hi> had <hi>begotten in his bonds,</hi> was his <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual ſon</hi> I know not; neither ſhall I detain my reader, any further than to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect two ſtories which this writer has publiſhed.</p>
            <p>In warning the people of <hi>Woodſtock</hi> of their danger, Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> ſays,
<q>By going after thoſe who are now cauſing diviſions and ſeparations among you, and conniving at their wicked doctrines and practices, you will be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of falling into ſuch errors, and embracing ſuch opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as will render your ſalvation altogether hopeleſs.</q>
p. 28. Then after allowing that there were ſome ſober baptiſts in the land 20 years ago, he ſays,
<q>As to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeparate baptiſts, 'tis well known that in opinion and practice, they are notoriouſly bad, and ſeem daily grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe. Witneſs Dr. <hi>Davis's</hi> book, which ſo far as I can underſtand, is generally liked among them. This man was as famous a baptiſt preacher as any in the country a few years ago, and what he is now come to, his book will ſhow, in which he blaſphemouſly attributes all conviction of ſin to the Devil.</q>
p. 29.</p>
            <p>This I perceive was delivered from the pulpit, which makes me think of Dr. <hi>Franck's</hi> ſaying, that he who hears
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:010823_0065_0F81D40A63991150"/>
ſuch a railer does not hear Chriſt, but the devil himſelf; for what could that <hi>accuſer</hi> ſay more falſe than this is! The paſtor of the baptiſt church in <hi>Stafford,</hi> informed me ſome years ago of one <hi>Davis</hi> a phyſician, who was caſt out of that church, for broaching antinomian errors; and that he publiſhed a ſmall pamphlet upon them afterward: but I never ſaw the man nor his book, and 'tis ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing "generally liked among" our churches, that very few have ever ſeen his book, and Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> may be boldly challenged to produce an inſtance if he can of one member in the baptiſt church in <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> or any church which they hold-fellowſhip with, who like or will countenance the horrid principle he ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p>The other ſtory concerns <hi>Wookſtock</hi> in particular. Mr. <hi>Foſter</hi> ſays,
<q>I am informed that not long ſince, there was a hopeful proſpect of the revival of ſerious godlineſs among you; that a number of perſons in this place, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſeriouſly and ſuitably concerned about the great things of God and religion, and were enquiring the way to Zion, with their faces thither ward; but no ſooner did theſe men, like a deſtroying flood, come in among you, but they flung all into confuſion, as you ſee this day, and in a moment daſhed all your hopes of a revival of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs amongſt you.</q>
p. 33.34.</p>
            <p>Now the plain ſtate of their caſe, as I have it from good authorities, is briefly thus. Vanity and extravagance, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially among young people in that place, had greatly prevailed: 'till a young man, who had been a ringleader in frolicking, happened to hear a <hi>baptiſt</hi> elder preach, in Dec. 1763. which was bleſt as a means of his <hi>awakening,</hi> and he continued under <hi>conviction</hi> 'till the next <hi>March,</hi> and then was brought out of darkneſs into marvellous light; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon four of his old companions came one evening, to try to get him back to his former way; but inſtead of that, two of them were ſeized under <hi>conviction</hi>; and they were moved to ſet up religious meetings, inſtead of their former frolicks; which meetings in a few weeks increaſed to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hundreds; and theſe meetings which were carried on by prayer, ſinging, reading, and mutual exhortation, were made a happy means of the awakening and hopeful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of a conſiderable number. And tho' they gladly improved occaſional opportunities of hearing baptiſt elders, yet they ſtill attended the pariſh meeting, 'till the miniſter there, upon a faſt which was appointed for the purpoſe, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

them: who plainly warned them againſt the firſt inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their awakening, as being the <hi>deceivers</hi> which ſhould come in the laſt times. And they evidently ſet up the ſame ſtandard that we have ſeen ſo much of before, of <hi>meaſuring themſelves by themſelves,</hi> ſo as to read all off for <hi>deluſion,</hi> which interfered with the order and honor of the old miniſters and churches as they ſtood.</p>
            <p>But for young converts to hear, the inſtruments and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that work, which turn'd them from vanity to love Chriſt, treated at ſuch a rate, it only ſerved to convince them that the miniſters who treated things at that rate, were wrong, and ſo finally cauſed a ſeparation from them, and a baptiſt church was gathered in that place. The former part of this account I had from the mouth of the young man who as firſt awakened there, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of one of the two young men who were convinced by him; and the reſt I have had atteſted by many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial evidences.</p>
            <p>I leave the reader to make his own remarks; and ſhall only obſerve that this author has intermixed with theſe ſlanders, ſome quotations of the moſt <hi>bitter</hi> ſentences againſt the baptiſts, that he could find in the antient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; it makes me think of a ſaying of one of the <hi>old Martyrs,</hi>
               <q>Alas! ſays he, ſuch is the wickedneſs of theſe our laſt days, that nothing moves us!—Neither the pure doctrine, the godlineſs of life, nor good example of the antient fathers.—If in anything they erred, that will their charitable children embrace, <hi>publiſh</hi> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with ſword, faggot and fire: but in vain they ſtrive againſt the ſtream; for tho' in deſpite of the truth, by force of the ears of crafty perſuaſion, they may bring themſelves into the haven of <hi>hell</hi>; yet can they not make all men believe that the banks move, while the ſhip ſaileth, nor ever ſhall be able to turn the direct courſe of the ſtream of God's truth.</q>
