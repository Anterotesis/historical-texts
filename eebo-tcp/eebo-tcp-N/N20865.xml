            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Iſt. THE Apothecary ſhall be Librarian.</p>
            <p>IId. The Librarian ſhall keep an accurate Catalogue of the Books, which ſhall ſpecify the Title, Author, Size, Number of Volumes, and depoſit, when loaned, of each Work.</p>
            <p>IIId. Every Work in the Library ſhall be numbered, both by a Label on the Back of each Volume, expreſſive of the Number, and by the ſame Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber written within the Volume; and on the Title-page of each Volume ſhall be written, <hi>"The Property of the New-York Hoſpital."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:027406_0024_0FD5D2AF7A521D60"/>
IVth. It is the Duty of the Librarian to receive, and give out, Books; obſerving, when they are returned, to replace them on the Shelves, after having carefully examined whether they are free from Damage.</p>
            <p>Vth. No Books can be lent out of the Library (except to the Governors, Phyſicians, and Surgeons, of the Hoſpital) but on Mondays, Wedneſdays, Thurſdays, and Saturdays, and between the Hours of Eleven and Twelve, when the preſcribing Hour is at Twelve; and between Eight and Nine, when it commences at Nine. The Viſiting Governors, Phyſicians, and Surgeons, are allowed to take out Books, at the Hours of their Attendance, on Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days and Fridays, and at the cuſtomary Hours on other Days.</p>
            <p>VIth. The Librarian is not authorized to let out Books to any Perſon, ſave the Governors, Phyſicians, Surgeons, Apothecary, and Houſe-Surgeon of the Hoſpital, and to ſuch Students of Medicine as are regularly admitted, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Rules of the Honſe, to ſee the Practice thereof, (except as herein after provided.)</p>
            <p>VIIth. The Governors, Phyſicians, and Surgeons, may take out a complete Work, even if it conſiſt of ſeveral Volumes,—but are not allowed this Liberty in reſpect to voluminous Collections of diſtinct Papers, ſuch as the Medical Commentaries, &amp;c. of which they can take but a ſingle Volume at a Time.</p>
            <p>VIIIth. No Student of Medicine can take out more than one Volume of any Work at a Time.</p>
            <p>IXth. Folios may be kept our four Weeks, Quartos three, and Duodecimos two Weeks.</p>
            <p>Xth. No Perſon can take out a Work, or a ſingle Volume of a Work, without leaving with the Librarian a Depoſit (to be ſpecified in the Catalogue, for each Work) of not leſs than one Third more than the actual Value of the Work. This Rule does not extend to certain Medical Collections, hereafter enumerated, in reſpect to which the Depoſit ſhall have Relation only to the Volume taken out.</p>
            <p>XIth. The Librarian ſhall make a regular Entry, at the Time of loaning any Work, of its Title, Volume, Borrower, and of the Depoſit made. He ſhall alſo make a like regular Entry of the Time when it is returned, and at the Time of its being returned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:027406_0025_0FD5CC9BC0C89B78"/>
XIIth. A Shilling a Week ſhall be paid for every Volume kept beyond the Time herein ſpecified. If the Volume be not returned within three Months, it is to be conſidered as loſt, and the Depoſit is forfeited to the Library.</p>

            <p>XIVth. Damages of Books are of four Degrees,—
<list>
                  <item>[<hi>a</hi>] The defacing the external Appearance of the Book;</item>
                  <item>[<hi>b</hi>] The deſtruction or conſiderable Injury of the Covering;</item>
                  <item>[<hi>c</hi>] Blots, Spots, and ſmall Rents, &amp;c.—ſo as to deface, but not deſtroy, the Contents of the Book;</item>
                  <item>[<hi>d</hi>] And, the tearing, ſo as to endanger or occaſion the Loſs of ſome Part of the Contents.—</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>When any Damage, ſhort of deſtroying its Value, happens to a Book, the Librarian is to notice and report it to the Viſiting Governors, who are to determine the Fine to be paid by the Borrower—according to the Degree and Nature of the Injury and the Coſt of the Book.—The Depoſit is to be retained till the Fine is paid. If the Borrower refuſes to pay the Fine, the Depoſit is forfeited.</p>
            <p>XVth. All Fines and Forfeitures are to be appropriated to the Uſe of the Library. The Librarian is to keep an exact Account of the ſame, which he is to render Monthly to the Viſiting Governors, and pay the Sums ſo collected to their Order.</p>
            <p>XVIth. The Librarian is reſponſible for the Library, agreeable to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue, and ſhall render a ſemi-annual (or, if it be required, more frequent) Account thereof, to the Governors.</p>
            <p>XVIIth. In all Caſes where Doubts ariſe reſpecting a Violation of the foregoing Rules, they ſhall be ſubmitted to the Viſiting Governors, or the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:027406_0026_0FD5D2B09A8ED7E8"/>

            <p>XVIIIth. Any Perſon making a Donation of Twenty-five Dollars, for the Benefit of the Library, or of Books, connected with Medicine, to that Amount, ſhall be entitled, during Life, to the Uſe of the whole Collection, agreeable to the foregoing Rules.</p>
