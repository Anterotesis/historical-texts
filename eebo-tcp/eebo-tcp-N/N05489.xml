            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THE holy Apoſtle begins this Chapter with ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Exhortations reſpecting the great Duty of Prayer, an eſſential Part of Religion, and which every Man who knows himſelf, and ſees his Dependance upon God, will be in the daily Exerciſe of, for himſelf. But here the Apoſtle lets his Son <hi>Timothy</hi> know, that Prayers, and eſpecially publick Prayers, (in which he and other Miniſters of Chriſt were to lead, and be the Mouth of the People unto God) may not be confined unto their own ſelves; but their devout Wiſhes, and thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Acknowledgements, ſhould extend even to all Mankind in general; and to thoſe of diſtinguiſhed Character for Power and Authority, in a particular Manner. <hi>I exhort therefore that firſt of all Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, and giving of Thanks, be made for all Men: for Kings, and all that are in Authority.</hi> v. 1, 2. And he ſuggeſts a twofold Reaſon herefor. The firſt taken from themſelves: that it would be for their own Good; even for the Peace, Order &amp; Welfare of Society. He and others ſhould pray for Kings, and all in Authority, that they might rule ſo in the fear of God, and with ſuch Wiſdom, juſtice and Clemency, as that the People might love and honour them; and under their wiſe and juſt

Adminiſtration, <hi>lead a quiet and peaceable Life, in all Godlineſs and Honeſty,</hi> v. 2.—The other Argument is taken from its being good, and right, and proper in it ſelf, and pleaſing to God: <hi>For this is good and acceptable in the Sight of God our Saviour,</hi> v. 3.</p>
            <p>And this Argument is further illuſtrated and confirmed by the following Words, which I have choſen for my Text: <hi>Who will have all Men to be ſaved, and to come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth.</hi> As much as to ſay, You may depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that Prayers and Interceſſions for all Men, are good and acceptable in the Sight of God our Saviour: For he would have all Men to be ſaved: And if he would have all Men to be ſaved; it muſt needs be good and acceptable to him, that we ſhould earneſtly pray for them: And it affords abundant Encouragement to be much in Prayer for them. Surely, ſince God is willing that they ſhould all be ſaved; we ought to expreſs our good Will &amp; Wiſhes in our Prayers for them, that they might be ſaved. Since God will have all Men to be ſaved; let it be our Hearts Deſire and Prayer to God, not only for Iſrael, that they may be ſaved; but that God's ſaving Health might be made known to all Nations; and that all Fleſh might ſee the Salvation of God.</p>
            <p>But what I propoſe on this Occaſion, is to conſider my Text by itſelf, as ſetting forth the <hi>univerſal Benevolence,</hi> and <hi>good Will,</hi> that God bears to Mankind; which is expreſs'd in two Things, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>

               </item>
               <item>2. In willing them the Means by which they may be ſaved, <abbr>
                     <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </abbr> The Knowledge of the Truth: <hi>Who will have all Men to be ſaved, and to come unto the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>Accordingly the two Points which our Text preſents to our Meditation at this Time, are theſe, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p>To each of theſe I ſhall ſpeak with all convenient Brevity; and then make ſuch an Application as may lead you to ſee the Pertinency of the Subject to the ſolemn Occaſion now before us.</p>

I. <hi>The great God may be ſaid in ſome Senſe to will the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So ſays my Text, <hi>Who will have all Men to be ſaved.</hi>—The Word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, here uſed for <hi>Will,</hi> is that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſed in the new Teſtament for willing any Thing, or for expreſſing the Will of God. Sometimes it ſignifies an <hi>efficacious Willing,</hi> whereby God does certainly effect the Thing that he <hi>wills;</hi> as when Chriſt ſaid, Matth. 8. 9. <hi>I WILL, be thou clean; and immediately his Leproſy was cleanſed.</hi> So Joh. 5. 21. <hi>The Son quickneth whom He WILL.</hi>—Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ſignifies a <hi>willing,</hi> wiſhing, or deſiring in God, that is not always <hi>efficacious.</hi> As <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. 37. <hi>How often WOULD I have gathered thy Children together &amp;c. and ye WOULD NOT.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now the Queſtion that naturally occurs here, is, <hi>How and in what Senſe it may be ſaid, that God WILLS the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Men; or WILL have all Men to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To which I would anſwer and ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It cannot be allowed to be with a <hi>decretive</hi> and <hi>efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not with an abſolute Purpoſe, and fixed Determination of his Will: For if ſo, then all Men would be ſaved; and yet by obſerving the general Tenor of many Mens Lives, and comparing the ſame with the Tenor of the Goſpel Covenant, the contrary is ſadly evident. If by the Will of God, in my Text, the divine <hi>Decree</hi> or <hi>Purpoſe</hi> or <hi>fixed Reſolution</hi> of his Will was intended; then all Men would certainly and infallibly be ſaved: For all the Purpoſes of the divine Will ſhall come to paſs. <hi>The Counſel of the Lord that ſhall ſtand, and the Thoughts of his Heart to all Generations,</hi> Pſal. 33. 4. So Prov. 19. 21. <hi>There are many Devices in a Man's Heart, nevertheleſs the Counſel of the Lord that ſhall ſtand.</hi> And there is nothing can defeat or diſappoint God in any of his Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: For as the ſame inſpired Preacher tells us, Prov. 21. 30. <hi>There is no Wiſdom nor Underſtanding nor Counſel against the Lord.</hi> For <hi>the Lord of Hoſts hath ſworn, ſaying, Surely as I have thought, ſo ſhall it come to paſs; and as I have purpoſed, it ſhall ſtand.</hi> Iſai 14. 24. And therefore, inſtead of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abſolute Purpoſe and Decree of God that all Men ſhould be ſaved; it muſt be ſaid, that in the Upſhot of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006955_0006_102AC45BD7960660"/>
Things with Reſpect to the whole World of Mankind, and when inſtead of their being all ſaved, the Wicked are all ſent away into everlaſting Puniſhment, and only the Righteous enter into Life eternal; this is all according to the Purpoſe and Will of God; even according to the determinate Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Fore-knowledge of God; as the Scripture expreſſes it concerning Chriſt being delivered to Death, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 23.</p>
            <p>But now, notwithſtanding all this, there is a Senſe in which God is willing that all Men ſhould be ſaved. But this leads us into an Abyſs: a Myſtery that is unfathomable by us.—The natural Notions we have of the divine Being, as well as Scripture Revelation, teach us, that <hi>known unto God are all his Works from the Beginning of the World,</hi> Act. 15. 18. And that ſuch an infinitely wiſe Being muſt needs have a Plan of Operation drawn in his own infinite Mind, from the Days of Eternity. And none can or dare ſay, that the Scheme drawn in the infinite Mind of God, ſhall be broken in upon; but that all will come to paſs according to the divine Determinations.—However, the natural Notions we have of the divine Goodneſs, and other Perfections; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with what we find in Scripture, plainly teach us, that God in ſome Senſe or other wills the Salvation of all Men.</p>
            <p>But now to form adequate Conceptions of the eternal Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of God; and of that Willingneſs he has for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all Men; ſo as to reconcile them in our own Minds, is quite beyond the limited &amp; feeble Faculties of Man. And therefore it rather becomes us with humble Reverence to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them both as Truths concerning God, than to deny either, or too curiouſly to pry into them: For it muſt be acknowledged, that this is a Caſe in which <hi>we know not how to order our Speech by Reaſon of Darkneſs.</hi> We are told, Deut. 29. 19. <hi>That ſecret Things belong to God.</hi> And ſurely there is nothing more ſecret to us than the <hi>divine Decrees,</hi> which he keeps within his own Breaſt. It is utterly a Secret to us, not only what God has purpoſed, and decreed, before it be revealed in his Word, or come to paſs in his Providence: But we cannot ſo much as conceive what theſe Purpo<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> or how they lie or operate in the divine Mind; or what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence they have upon natural Cauſes, or upon moral Agents, or how far they take away their free Agency, or neceſſitate Things as to their final Event.—But as we are told in the Verſe
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006955_0007_102AC45E41B13E28"/>
before quoted, <hi>That Things revealed belong to us and to our Children;</hi> ſo then it is the <hi>revealed Will of God,</hi> that we have to do with, and that belongs to us to conſider. Accordingly I proceed to anſwer poſitively,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God may be ſaid to will the Salvation of all Men, as he in his Word manifeſts ſuch a Willingneſs, and gives us many ample Tokens thereof in the Diſpenſations of his Grace to the Children of Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we read of God's willing the Salvation of all Men, we are to conſider it as ſpoken after the Manner of Men, and in Accommodation to our Capacities: And we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it after the ſame Manner as when we read of God's being <hi>angry,</hi> or <hi>vexed,</hi> or <hi>grieved,</hi> or that he <hi>repented</hi> of the Evil he thought to do; which Affections of Mind we may not attribute to God juſt in the ſame Manner as we do to our ſelves; becauſe they would be inconſiſtent with an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely perfect Being; and interrupt the perfect Tranquillity that forever poſſeſſes the divine Mind. So God's willing the Salvation of all Men, is not ſuch a willing, as will give any Interruption to the divine Happineſs, tho' it be not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed: For altho' they be not all ſaved, yet he is God bleſſed for ever.</p>
            <p>And therefore when it is ſaid, God will have all Men to be ſaved, it is to be underſtood, that the Declarations he has made of himſelf in his Word, and the Diſpenſation of Grace he has put us under, are evident Tokens of ſuch a Willingneſs in God. Accordingly, this may be conſidered as the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Will of God; as ſuch a Willingneſs for the Salvation of all Men is declared in his Word: as in our Text, <hi>Who will have all Men to be ſaved;</hi> which is expreſſed without any Exception or Reſervation; agreable to which, and further to ſet forth the Univerſality of the divine Benevolence to Mankind, ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 Epiſt. 3. 9. <hi>Not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that ALL ſhould come to Repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover, it may be conſidered as the Preceptive Will of God. He wills, that is, he commands, that all Men ſhould be ſaved; and this he does, as he commands, thoſe Things univerſally that accompany Salvation, yea and in which Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation does very much conſiſt.—The Preceptive Will of God is univerſal; what he ſays to one, he ſays to all who come within hearing of it. And now God may be ſaid to will
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006955_0008_102AC4615A70D838"/>
the Salvation of all Men, as truly &amp; as really as he wills they ſhould keep his Commandments. As he wills that all Men ſhould obey him, ſo he wills that they ſhould all be ſaved; becauſe there is an inſeparable Connection between Obedience and Salvation, and the one implies the other. Thus we are told, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 30. That <hi>God commands all Men every where to repent.</hi> Well, juſt ſo he wills that all Men every where ſhould be ſaved: For that Repentance which he wills, is unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: Nay true Repentance is Salvation; Salvation begun in the Soul: And it ſeems by the Apoſtle as if Repentance and Salvation were ſynonimous or convertible Terms, in the forementioned 2 Pet. 3. 9. <hi>Not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance.</hi> Where <hi>periſhing</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are put in Oppoſition, plainly ſignifying that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance is the ſame with Salvation, which is the contrary or oppoſite to periſhing. So again, it is the Will of God that <hi>all Men ſhould honour the Son even as they honour the Father,</hi> Joh. 5. 23. Well, this is as much as to will the Salvation of all Men: <hi>For this is Life eternal, to know</hi> and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the <hi>true God and Jeſus Christ whom he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſent,</hi> Joh. 17. 3. Again, who is there but what will acknowledge that God wills Men to forſake their Sins, turn to him, and lead holy Lives? For this is the Will of God, even your Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. And if he wills that all Men ſhould flee from Sin and follow Holineſs, he wills that all Men ſhould be ſaved, for Holineſs and Freedom from Sin, is that in which a great Part of our Happineſs conſiſts. Finally here, ſince <hi>the Grace of God which has appeared unto all Men, bringing Salvation, teaches us to deny all Ungodlineſs, and worldly Lusts, and to live ſoberly, and righteouſly, and godly in this preſent World,</hi> (Tit. 2. 11, 12.) it muſt be allowed to be the Will of God that we ſhould all thus live; and this is to will the Salvation of all: For it is in this Way that the Grace of God brings Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto us.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, if there be any Perſons who doubt whether God is really willing that all Men ſhould be ſaved, let them conſider whether God be really willing that all ſhould repent, that all ſhould believe, that all ſhould forſake their Sins, and obey the Goſpel; and conſider whether all ſuch do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict and oppoſe the Will of God, who do not repent of their Sins, and live as the Goſpel teaches them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:006955_0009_102AC462DBDC81E0"/>
And now, would it not be very ſhocking to you, for any to ſay, that God was not willing that all Men ſhould repent, that he was not willing they ſhould all turn from their Sins, and was not willing they ſhould all obey his Commands? Why, it is really as ſhocking for any to ſay, that God is not willing that all ſhould be ſaved: Becauſe Repentance, and Faith, and Obedience, and Salvation, are ſo interwoven toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the one neceſſarily implies the other.</p>
            <p>But then, I would go on further to ſay, that God wills the Salvation of all Men, as he has done and is doing thoſe Things which indicate ſuch a Willingneſs, or are outward, open, and manifeſt Tokens of his Willingneſs that all Men ſhould be ſaved. As particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In the all ſufficient Saviour he provided for ſinful Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>God did not provide a Saviour who was able only to ſave a few of the fallen Race; but One who was able to ſave every Son and Daughter of <hi>Adam.</hi> I am not now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Extent of Chriſt's Redemption, as to the divine Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Deſign, or as to the real Event of it; for this is a ſecret Thing, and belongs not to us, but to God. But what I am now conſidering, is the Extent of his Merits, and of his Power; and conſidered in this Reſpect, it is univerſal. Of ſuch infinite Virtue are the Merits of Chriſt's Blood, that it is ſufficient to take away the Sin of the whole World. If every Man in the whole World ſhould be ſaved, there would not need any other Sacrifice than Chriſt has already made of himſelf; and therefore with Reſpect to the Sufficiency of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement, Chriſt may be ſaid to have died for all; <hi>to have taſted Death for every Man; and to be the Propitiation for our Sins, and not for ours only, but for the Sins of the whole World.</hi> Moreover there is not only ſuch a Sufficiency of Merit in Chriſt, but a Sufficiency of Power: For all Power is given to him in Heaven, and in Earth: That as his Blood was ſufficient to waſh away the Guilt of the whole World; ſo his Power is ſufficient to ſubdue the ſtrongeſt Habits of Sin, and bring us over to a willing Subjection to him, and to his Goſpel. So that there is every Thing in him neceſſary to render him a compleat All-ſufficient Saviour to the whole World of Mankind: Surely <hi>He is able to ſave to the uttermoſt.</hi> And now this may be conſidered as a Token of God's Will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingneſs that all Men ſhould be ſaved: For when God has
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006955_0010_102AC4655D8A5508"/>
provided a Saviour able to ſave the whole World; what are we led to argue from thence, but that God is willing that all ſhould be ſaved? Who can think that God is unwilling to have the Malady healed, for which he has been at infinite Coſt to provide a ſovereign Remedy? And that when he has ſpread a Plaiſter large enough for the whole Sore, he ſhould be unwilling to have it applied?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>His Willingneſs that all Men ſhould be ſaved, appears in the extenſive Commiſſion and Charge that Chriſt gave to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when he ſent them forth to preach the Goſpel of Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus when our bleſſed Lord took Leave of his Diſciples, he left this in ſolemn Charge to them, ſaying <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18. 19. All Power is given to me in Heaven and in Earth; Go ye therefore <hi>and teach all Nations,</hi> baptizing them &amp;c. or as <hi>Mark</hi> gives it to us, <hi>Mar.</hi> 16 15. Go ye into <hi>all the World,</hi> and preach the Goſpel to <hi>every Creature;</hi> he that believeth ſhall be ſaved &amp;c. So that the offers of Salvation upon Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Terms were to be made to every Creature, that is, to every Man thro'out the whole World, without Exception. And who dare ſay, that when the offers of Salvation are ordered to be made to all, but that God is willing all ſhould accept and be ſaved?</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Another Token of God's Willingneſs that all ſhould be ſaved, is the Extenſiveneſs of the Proclamation of Grace, and the very general Terms he makes uſe of in inviting us to Pardon and Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Iſai. 55. 1. <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come ye to the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters &amp;c.</hi> v. 7. <hi>Let the Wicked,</hi> let him be who he will, and how wicked ſoever, and how many ſoever; there is ſuch an unlimited Latitude in the Words, as may extend to every wicked Man and Woman in the World: <hi>Let him forſake his Way, and turn unto the Lord, and he will have Mercy on him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</hi> So Joh. 7. 37. Jeſus ſtood and cried, <hi>If any Man thirſt;</hi> any Man, or every Man if he thirſts, <hi>let him come to me and drink.</hi> So Rev. 22. 17. <hi>The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come, and let him that is athirſt ſay, Come, and whoſoever will let him take of the Waters of Life freely.</hi> Now who can read ſuch general and gracious Invitations as theſe in the Word of God, and doubt his Willingneſs that they ſhould be ſaved?</p>
            <p>To theſe let us add,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:006955_0011_102AC468DACF6358"/>
4. <hi>The ſolemn Declarations that God makes of his Unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that any ſhould periſh; and his Deſires that all ſhould come <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Repentance and be ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Ezek. 18. 23. <hi>Have I any Pleaſure at all that the Wicked ſhould die, ſaith the Lord God: and not that he ſhould turn from his Way and live?</hi> v. 32. <hi>For I have no Pleaſure in the Death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord God; wherefore turn your ſelves, and live ye.</hi> And to convince People of the Truth hereof, and not leave the leaſt Room for doubting in this Matter, He ſwears by himſelf, by his own Life, becauſe he could ſwear by no greater, Ezek. 33. 11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no Pleaſure in the Death of the Wicked; but that the Wicked turn from his Way and live; turn ye, turn ye, from your evil Ways, for why will ye die, O Houſe of Iſrael?</hi> And agreable to this, ſays the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned 2 Pet. 3. 9. <hi>God is Long-ſuffering to us-ward, not will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that any ſhould periſh, but that ALL ſhould come to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi> Add to this,</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>With what Reluctance and Backwardneſs God's giving up any to Deſtruction is repreſented; and how much he is grieved when any by their Obſtinacy and final Impenitency, make it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for him as a righteous Judge to deliver them over to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus we ſee the Workings of the divine Compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sinners, Hoſ. 11. 8. <hi>How ſhall I give thee up Ephraim? how ſhall I deliver thee, Iſrael &amp;c. Mine Heart is turned within <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> my Repentings are kindled together.</hi> And when our bleſſed Lord ſaw how Jeruſalem had ſinned away their Day of Grace, and were juſt giving the finiſhing Stroke as to the filling up the Meaſure of their Sins: how did his Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion yearn towards them? Luk. 19. 41, 42. <hi>And when he was come near, he beheld the City, and wept over it, ſaying, If thou hadst known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy Day, the Things which belong unto thy Peace; but now they are hidden from thine Eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, laying all theſe Things together, it appears moſt evident, that there is in God a Willingneſs that all Men ſhould be ſaved. So that whatever be the eternal Purpoſes of God, which are held in his own Breaſt, and entirely hid from us; yet they are not ſuch, but God does in ſome Senſe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006955_0012_102AC46CF27FF698"/>
will the Salvation of all Men. Indeed he don't ſo will their Salvation as to break in upon the grand Scheme of Things drawn in his own infinite Mind; nor ſo as actually to effect it. But then, there is a Senſe wherein he wills the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all Men; in ſo much that with Reſpect to thoſe who finally periſh, it cannot be ſaid that they periſh, becauſe God was not willing they ſhould be ſaved, but becauſe they would not accept of Salvation upon the Terms that it was offered to them. Not becauſe Chriſt was not able or willing to ſave them; but becauſe <hi>they would not come unto him that they might have Life.</hi>—I am ſenſible, this is a very nice Point, and the Solution of Difficulties, and anſwering Objections that have been ſtarted, has puzled and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed the Minds of Men: And therefore to pretend to go to the Depth of theſe Things, will ſhew our Curioſity and Conceit, rather than our Wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore proceed to ſay,</p>
            <p>II. <hi>As the Way and Means of Men's Salvation, God wills that they ſhould</hi> COME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH.</p>
            <p>Who will have all Men to be ſaved, <hi>and come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth:</hi> That is, as the Way and Means of their being ſaved. As he wills them to be ſaved, ſo he wills them the Means of Salvation, even <hi>the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, if any of you aſk with <hi>Pilate, What is Truth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer in general, It is Chriſt himſelf, and the Goſpel concerning him</p>
            <p>Chriſt himſelf is the Truth: The only begotten of the Father was <hi>full of Grace and Truth,</hi> Joh. 1. 14. Yea, He is <hi>the Truth,</hi> and <hi>the Life,</hi> that is, the true and living Way unto the Father. <hi>For no Man cometh to the Father but by him,</hi> Joh. 14. 6. And as Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is <hi>the Truth,</hi> ſo is the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, for it declares <hi>the Truth</hi> concerning him. The Goſpel contains the true and faithful Sayings of God; even all the Account that God has ſeen Cauſe to give us concerning his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and the Way to Salvation by him. The Goſpel may be called <hi>the Truth,</hi> as it was written by Inſpiration of God, even of the Spirit of Truth, which Chriſt promiſed to ſend to his Diſciples to lead them into all Truth, that is, all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006955_0013_102AC46E75FAA638"/>
Truth. So then the Goſpel is the Truth, as it contains a true Account of Chriſt, of his Perſon, and his Offices, of his Incarnation and Life, of his Doctrines and Miracles, of his Death and Reſurrection, and Aſcenſion into Heaven: Of the Salvation that he hath purchaſed for poor Sinners: and the Terms upon which the ſame is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto us. And ſo in ſhort the Goſpel is the Truth, as it contains every Truth, neceſſary to be known, believed and practiſed, in order to our being ſaved: For it is able to make us wiſe unto Salvation, thro' Faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>According, I ſhall here ſay two Things,
<list>
                  <item>1. The appointed Means of Men's Salvation is the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth. And therefore,</item>
                  <item>2. God wills that all Men ſhould come to the Knowledge of the Truth in order to their being ſaved.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The appointed Way and Means of Men's Salvation is the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That is, the Knowledge of Chriſt, and of what the Goſpel reveals concerning him, is the only Way that we know of, for any to come to that Faith, that Repentance, that new Obedience, as ſhall be unto Salvation. What God can do, or may have done in ſpecial Caſes, by an Act of his ſovereign Power and Grace, in communicating Light and Grace to their Souls, who have not had the Light of the Goſpel, is not for us to ſay. But this we muſt ſay, that the ordinary Way of Salvation is by the Knowledge of Goſpel Truths. Such in general as the Fall of Man by Sin, and the Redemption wro't out by Jeſus Chriſt, and the Repentance towards God, and the Faith toward our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Goſpel Obedience, which is the Way of Salvation. And altho' a diſtinct and particular Knowledge of every Point of Chriſtian Divinity be not abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation: And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' there are many Truths contained in the Word of God, that are not eſſential Truths: And altho' there be many Truths that ſome Men lay great Streſs upon, yet are not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary fundamental Articles of our Creed; yet there is a Knowledge of Goſpel-Truths neceſſary, according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Method of Salvation. Thus,</p>
            <p>As true Repentance is neceſſary to Salvation; ſo in order to this, there muſt be a Conviction of Sin: But now, there is
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:006955_0014_102AC470DDF39A40"/>
no coming to the Knowledge of Sin, but by the Knowledge of the Law &amp; Goſpel, that Sin is the Tranſgreſſion of. Moreover, Faith in Jeſus Chriſt is the Goſpel-Way of Salvation: But now, as the Apoſtle argues, Rom. 10. 14, 15. <hi>How ſhall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear, without a Preacher? And how ſhall they preach, except they be ſent? So then Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God.</hi> v. 17.—Furthermore, Chriſt is declared to be the <hi>Author of eternal Salvation to all that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5. 9. But how can they obey him, unleſs they have the Will of Chriſt made known to them, and the Rule of Chriſtian Obedience ſet before them; which is done only in the Goſpel? In ſhort, for the Heart of Man to be without Knowledge, Goſpel-Knowledge, is not good, or ſafe for him. Multitudes, Multitudes periſh for lack of this Viſion. And many of God's profeſſing People, who live in a Land of Light, and even in the Valley of Viſion; are deſtroyed for lack of Knowledge: <hi>Whereas to know the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent, is Life eternal,</hi> Joh. 17. 3.</p>
            <p>Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God wills that all Men ſhould come to the Knowledge of the Truth, as the Way to their being ſaved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, God's willing that Men ſhould come to the Knowledge of the Truth, appears in the Methods he has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for ſpreading the Goſpel among Mankind. As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>God has delivered his Word, containing all neceſſary and ſaving Truths, in Writing to us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>He has written to us the great Things of his Law,</hi> and of his Goſpel. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 8. 12. Now by this the Record of divine Truths is preſerved, to which Men may repair, as to a Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard of Truth for Inſtruction, Admonition or Counſel. And being written <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> gives Opportunity for its being tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed or printed; and for its being tranſlated into all Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and ſo tranſmitted to all Nations, as well as to all Ages and Generations of Men. The Word of God being written, I ſay, is capable of being thus extenſively uſeful to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>God's Willingneſs that all Men ſhould come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, appears by the ſolemn Charge Chriſt gave his Apoſtles about Preaching the Goſpel in all Parts of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:006955_0015_102AC474798B5E78"/>
So far was Chriſt from confining them to the loſt Sheep of the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or to any particular People, that he charges them to go and <hi>teach all Nations;</hi> yea, to <hi>go into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> Mar. 16 19. Which plainly ſhews, that it was the declared preceptive Will of God, that every Man &amp; Woman upon Earth ſhould have the Goſpel of Salvation brought to them, without any Exception. Again,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>The pouring out of the holy Ghoſt in the miraculous Gift of Tongues, was a further Evidence that it was the Will of God, that all People ſhould come to the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For being enabled all at once to ſpeak all Manner of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, they were fitted to go immediately to any People or Nation or Language under the whole Heavens; and by that very Gift of Tongues they were enabled not only to teach every Nation, but as it was a miraculous Gift, it ſerved to confirm their Miſſion at the ſame Time: For in that very Gift of Tongues, they not only carried a Capacity to teach People of every Language, but a Power to confirm to ſuch a People, that they were ſent of God unto them; for theſe very Gifts of Tongues, together with other miraculous Gifts, were the Credentials and Teſtimonials of the divine Miſſion. So that if we ſhould ſuppoſe the Apoſtles, when Chriſt order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to go and teach all Nations, had objected, ſaying within themſelves, How can we go to People of a ſtrange Language, and whoſe Words we cannot underſtand, nor they underſtand ours, who can only ſpeak our Mother-Tongue? I ſay, ſuppoſing the Apoſtles had thus objected within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; yet on the Day of Pentecoſt, all thoſe Objections were entirely removed; for the holy Ghoſt no ſooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared <hi>in cloven Tongues like as of Fire, and ſat upon each of them,</hi> but they found themſelves immediately qualified to go as their Maſter had commanded them, into all the World, and to preach the Goſpel to every Creature: and had this comforting and encouraging Word from Chriſt to animate them to ſuch a Service, <hi>Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the End of the World,</hi> Matth. 28. 20. Intimating, that it was his Will that his Apoſtles ſhould go into all the World preaching the Goſpel of Truth unto them, and that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Goſpel-Truths, ſhould be preſerved among them by
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006955_0016_102AC476F014D298"/>
a conſtant Succeſſion of Goſpel-Miniſters, with whom Chriſt would be, by his Power and Grace, tho' in a more ordinary Way, from Age to Age, even to the End of the World. All which plainly ſhews it to be the Will of God, that all Men ſhould come to the Knowledge of the Truth, as the Means of Salvation.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the</p>
            <div type="application">
               <head>APPLICATION.</head>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Here we ſee the infinite Love, and good Will of God to Man, that he is willing that all Men ſhould be ſaved, and has given ſuch abundant Tokens of his Willingneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely God in the Goſpel has given a moſt glorious Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his infinite Goodneſs, and of his univerſal Benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, triumphing over all our ſinful Unworthineſs; that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the infinite Provocation we have all offered to him by Sin, ſo that the <hi>whole World is become guilty before God,</hi> yet he has a Love of Benevolence, and Compaſſion to all Mankind; in ſo much that we may all unite and ſing with the Multitude of the heavenly Hoſt upon the Birth of the great Saviour, <hi>Glory to God in the higheſt, Peace on Earth, and GOOD WILL TOWARDS MEN,</hi> Luk. 2. 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence the final Deſtruction of Sinners will lie at their own Doors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They will not be able to plead, that God was not willing they ſhould be ſaved: for God willeth that all Men ſhould be ſaved. Sinners will not be able to plead, that they were willing; but God was not willing they ſhould be ſaved. But on the contrary, it will be charged on Goſpel-Sinners, that God would have gathered them as a Hen doth her Chickens under her Wings, but they would not: That when Chriſt invited them, they would not come unto him, that they might have Life: That when he called, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed; when he ſtretched out his Hand, they would not regard it. And therefore inſtead of charging their Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction upon God's not being willing they ſhould be ſaved; their own Conſciences will everlaſtingly upbraid them, as in Prov. 5. 12. <hi>How have I hated Instruction, and mine Heart deſpiſed Reproof?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:006955_0017_102AC478A6DC70C8"/>
3. <hi>What infinite Obligations are we under to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in and by whom alone it is, that God is willing that all Men ſhould be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The dearly beloved Son of God has by his Obedience and Death, paid a Price ſufficient for the Sins of the whole World; ſo that if every Sinner upon Earth was to be ſaved, there would need no more Sacrifice for Sin: For by that one Offering of Chriſt, ſuch Satisfaction is made to divine Juſtice, reſpecting our Breaches of the divine Law, that upon the Terms of Goſpel-Faith and Repentance, God is recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilable to every Sinner upon Earth. With what Love and Gratitude then ſhould we be filled to this great Redeemer: <hi>And how ſhould our Souls magnify the Lord, and our Spirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in God our Saviour?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>What Encouragement is here for all Sinners, let them be who they will, to come and be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Are you never ſo poor, and mean and deſpicable? Nay, are you never ſuch great and vile Sinners? Yet depend upon it, God is willing to be reconciled to you, if you will but return unto him. We have a Warrant from the Goſpel to ſay to any, and to every Sinner upon Earth, that God is willing to pardon and ſave him, if he will but repent, and turn, and lay hold on the Hope that is ſet before him. If Sinners have gone to the greateſt Length of Sinning; yet even then it may be ſaid, that God is willing to pardon and ſave them, if they will but accept of Salvation as offered in the Goſpel: It will not be God's Unwillingneſs to ſave, but Sinners Unwillingneſs to be ſaved in the Way of the Goſpel, that will be their eternal Deſtruction: For <hi>him that cometh unto me,</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> Joh. 6. 37.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>Since the Way and Means of Salvation is by the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Truth, as it is in Jeſus, and in his Goſpel; what an unſpeakable Priviledge is it, to enjoy that Goſpel which reveals this Truth unto us?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is one of the greateſt Bleſſings we can enjoy on this Side Heaven; becauſe it is the appointed Means of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to Heaven at laſt. Let the Light of the glorious Goſpel be compared with meer natural Light; and eſpecially if we compare it with heatheniſh Ignorance and Darkneſs,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:006955_0018_102AC47B01E2A2B0"/>
or with Mahometan Impoſtures, or with Romiſh Antichriſtian Errors, and Deluſions; we ſhall ſee how much they have the Advantage above all the reſt of Mankind, to whom are committed, and by whom are freely enjoyed the Oracles of God: It is by the Inſtrumentality of this Word of Truth, that Men are turned from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God. How then ſhould we and all Proteſtants who have the free Enjoyment of this Goſpel, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this diſtinguiſhing Favour, and <hi>bleſs the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath</hi> thus <hi>bleſſed us with all ſpiritual Bleſſings in heavenly Things in Chriſt Jeſus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>How aggravated will the Guilt and Condemnation of all ſuch be, who have the Advantage of coming to the Knowledge of the Truth, and be ſaved; and yet periſh at laſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely theſe of all Men will receive the heavieſt Doom. They will have no Cloke for their Sin; but will be utterly left without Excuſe. They will not be able to plead, that God was unwilling to ſave them; nor will they be able to plead want of Means, while they live under the clear Light of Goſpel-Truths: For they refuſe or neglect the very Means of Salvation, that God has provided; and ſo all the Blame will lie upon themſelves. <hi>And this will be their Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> (and none ſo heavy as this) <hi>that Light is come into the World,</hi> and ſhone round about them; <hi>but they have choſen Darkneſs rather than Light, becauſe their Deeds were Evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>Since the Goſpel contains the Knowledge of the Truth by which we may be ſaved; of what Importance is it, that this Goſpel ſhould be ſent into all Nations of the Earth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Way for them to come to the Knowledge of the Truth, ſo as to be ſaved; and it is the very Means of Salvation that God has appointed. Surely then, there is nothing of equal Importance with this, to Mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. The Nations who are deſtitute of this Goſpel, are pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing in Ignorance and Error: whereas this Goſpel is able to make them wiſe unto Salvation thro' Faith in Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore of as much Importance as is the eternal Salvation of precious Souls, of ſo much Importance is it, that they ſhould have the Goſpel ſent unto them. We cannot wiſh a greater Bleſſing to the dark benighted and bewildred World,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006955_0019_102AC47E6A069350"/>
than the Light of the Goſpel. And it is impoſſible for Chriſtians to do a greater Kindneſs to the ignorant Heathen, than to ſend the Goſpel to them. <hi>Bleſſed are the People who know the joyful Sound.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>From what we have heard we may learn, at whoſe Door it lies, as the faulty Cauſe, that ſo great a Part of Mankind are at this Day deſtitute of the Knowledge of the Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely we may not lay it at God's Door: For he has not only manifeſted his Willingneſs that all Men ſhould be ſaved, but has publiſhed the Goſpel of Salvation, and gave expreſs Orders to his Apoſtles to go into all the World, and preach this Goſpel to every Creature; and they attended to his Charge, and went forth into all Parts of the known World, preaching the Goſpel to all Nations of the Earth. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Apoſtle obſerves, Rom. 10. 18. <hi>Yes verily, their Sound went into all the Earth: and their Words unto the Ends of the World.</hi> And as it was the Command of Chriſt, that his Goſpel ſhould reach the Ends of the Earth; ſo we may conclude, that it is agreable to his Will, that when any Part of the World is deſtitute of the Goſpel, it ſhould be ſent unto them. Surely he is willing that all ſhould come to the Knowledge of the Truth; and has done ſo much in order to it, as abundantly to ſhew his Willingneſs: And therefore that ſo great a Part of the World at this Day lies in Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is not to be attributed to God's Unwillingneſs that they ſhould receive the Goſpel; but it is to be attributed to the Oppoſition, the Backwardneſs, the Negligence and Sloth of ſome or other of the Children of Men, as the faulty Cauſe hereof.</p>
               <p>Indeed, it muſt be acknowledged, that the further Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of divine Providence, and the Influences of the Spirit, are abſolutely neceſſary to the further Spreading the Goſpel in the World. It depends upon God, who has the Hearts of all in his own Hands, to raiſe up, qualify for, and ſpirit Men unto ſuch a difficult &amp; ſelf denying Service. It is with God alſo to enlarge the Hearts of the Rich &amp; Great, to ſupport ſuch Miſſionaries, who ſhall carry the Goſpel to dark and diſtant Regions. And it likewiſe depends upon the divine Influence, to open a Door of Entrance for the Goſpel among ſuch who naturally oppoſe the Principles and
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:006955_0020_102AC480E73FB2F0"/>
Precepts thereof; and to render it finally ſucceſsful: For altho' <hi>Paul planteth, and Apollos watereth,</hi> yet <hi>God giveth the Increaſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. 6. And yet it muſt not be attributed to God, but to Man, as the faulty Cauſe, that ſo great a Part of the World ſtill lies in Ignorance.</p>
               <p>Here then let me ſay,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is to be attributed partly to a People's not receiving and embracing the Goſpel when brought unto them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus when the Apoſtles brought the Goſpel to ſome Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, it was generally diſbelieved, and deſpiſed, and ſo rejected by them; They believed not the Report of the Goſpel, but treated it with Reproach and Contempt; as the <hi>Athenians</hi> did, when the Apoſtle brought the Goſpel to them: For altho' ſome few believed, yet the Generality of them mocked, <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 32. calling him <hi>a Babler, and a ſetter forth of ſtrange Gods,</hi> v. 18. So if the Goſpel was treated with ſuch Contempt at <hi>Athens,</hi> and with cruel Outrage at ſome other Places, it was not of God, but of themſelves, and their own Fault, if they continued in their heatheniſh Ignorance.</p>
               <p>Moreover,</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It has been from People's not retaining the Goſpel, but ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it by their Indifferency and Neglect to die away among them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This has been long ago the ſad Caſe of many Places, where the Goſpel was preached, and at firſt embraced, and Goſpel Churches founded, and in a flouriſhing State for a while; but by ſinking away into <hi>Laodicean</hi> Lukewarmneſs, and Indifference about the Goſpel, Chriſtian Knowledge, as well as Holineſs, languiſhed and died away. The ſeven Golden Candleſticks, or famous Churches of <hi>Aſia,</hi> have been awful Inſtances hereof, as well as many other Places; in that Part of the World eſpecially: For there, where Chriſtianity firſt began, and flouriſhed in the primitive Ages of it, they by their Negligence, Sloth, and want of Zeal for the Goſpel, have ſo loſt it, that there are ſcarcely the Footſteps of Chriſtianity left among them; but they are overſpread and ſwallowed up with <hi>Mahometan</hi> Impoſtures. And many other Places which have had the Goſpel once among them, have let it drop by Degrees, and returned to heatheniſh Ignorance and Error.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:006955_0021_102AC483BACCBC00"/>
3. <hi>The preſent Ignorance and Darkneſs of ſo great a Part of the World is owing to the ſhameful Backwardneſs of Chriſtians to carry the Goſpel to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſtians have not ſuch a Zeal for Spreading the Goſpel as the Importance of the Thing calls for. Thoſe who might be proper Perſons to carry the Everlaſting Goſpel to the poor periſhing Heathen, chooſe rather to ſit down in Eaſe at Home, than to engage in ſuch difficult and ſelf-denying Service, as to carry the Goſpel to the dark and diſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of the Earth. There is ſuch a general Backwardneſs to go forth upon ſuch Errands, that when God does as it were inquire, as in Iſai. 6. 8. <hi>Whom ſhall I ſend, and who will go for us?</hi> It is a rare Thing to find one ſo touched as with <hi>a live Coal from off the Altar;</hi> ſo fired with a Zeal for the Glory of God, and the Salvation of Souls, as to anſwer with the Prophet, <hi>Here am I, ſend me.</hi> But they ſeem all with one Conſent to make Excuſe. Verily, if they who are qualified for the Goſpel-Miniſtry, had ſuch a Love to Chriſt, and ſuch a Concern for his Honour, and the Enlargement of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom as they ought to have; ſo great a Part of the World would not lie in Ignorance and Darkneſs, as now it does. The Goſpel would at leaſt be carried to them, and they would have Goſpel-Light and Grace offered to them, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they received, or rejected it.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It is very much owing to the Backwardneſs of profeſſing Chriſtians to expend of their Substance for the Support and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement of thoſe who have been inclined to go forth upon ſuch difficult Service.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Altho' many gracious and generous Souls in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and in other Chriſtian Nations, have given liberally out of their Eſtates for propagating the Goſpel in heatheniſh and ignorant Parts of the World; yet it muſt be ſaid, that in general there has been a narrow ſtingy Spirit, among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtians upon this Account, whereby the Cauſe has been very much ſtarved; and Perſons diſcouraged and diſheartned in the Undertaking. This is the unhappy Caſe, People chooſe rather to lay out their Wealth to indulge their Luxury, and gratify their Pride, than to propagate the Goſpel, and ſpread the Knowledge of the Truth.</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:006955_0022_102AC485415385F8"/>
5. <hi>It is very much owing to the unexemplary, unbecoming Carriage of Chriſtian Profeſſors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chriſtians have not recommended the Goſpel by their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, as they ſhould have done. Paganiſm, Mahometiſm, or Antichriſtianiſm, would not have kept their Ground, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed as they have done, if Chriſtians had in any good Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure lived up to their Character: But the looſe and ſinful Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of ſome who wear the Name of Chriſtians, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced Multitudes againſt Chriſtianity: For they judging the Chriſtian Religion by the Lives of ſome who profeſs it, could not but have an ill Opinion of it. Whereas, if Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whenever they went Abroad, and among Strangers, were careful to live up to Chriſtian Precepts and Principles, they would greatly recommend it to others: Hence our Saviour ſo earneſtly inculcates an exemplary Life, on all his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as the Way to bring others to receive and embrace Chriſtianity. Matth. 5. 16. <hi>Let your Light ſo ſhine before Men, that they may ſee your good Works, and glorify your Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Wherefore,</p>
               <p n="9">9. <hi>Let Chriſtians all be humble, that there has been ſo little done by them for Spreading the Goſpel; and be exhorted to beſtir themſelves more vigorouſly than ever, that the poor</hi> ignorant beathen <hi>might come to the Knowledge of the Truth, and be ſaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there are many Things may be offered to Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that may ſerve to humble Chriſtians for their Neglects, and move them to do their Duty in this Matter. Thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt of all, the Argument of our Text is a very cogent one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Would God have all Men to be ſaved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth, as the Means of their Salvation? We may then very certainly conclude, it is agreable to the Will of God, that Chriſtians ſhould do all they can, to ſpread the Goſpel of Salvation among Mankind. Shall the great God, who has been ſo affronted by our Sins, be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notwithſtanding, that all Men ſhould be ſaved? And ſhall we feel a Backwardneſs, or Indifferency about their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Shall God be willing for the Salvation of all Men; and ſhall we be concerned only for our own Salvation, and the Salvation of our Friends &amp; Neighbours? Surely, true Grace is a more generous Principle than this.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:006955_0023_102AC4879455D750"/>
2. <hi>The Example of our dear Saviour, is a moſt powerful Argument why we ſhould encounter the greateſt Difficulties to promote the Salvation of Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He deny'd himſelf to make Way for our Salvation: and ſo ought every one, as he would approve himſelf a true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Chriſt. <hi>If any Man will come after me, let him deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his Croſs, and follow me,</hi> Math 16. 24. Did Chriſt the Son of God, to bring about our Salvation, leave the Boſom of the Father, and the Realms of Light &amp; Glory above, and come down to this our Earth? And ſhall ſuch who are qualified for it, make ſuch a Difficulty in leaving their Father's Houſe, or their native Land, to carry the Goſpel of Salvation to other People? Did Chriſt ſubmit to be a Man of Sorrows, and to be acquainted with Grief; yea did he ſubmit to the curſed &amp; cruel Death of the Croſs, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe Salvation for us; what a Shame then, that Chriſtians ſhould be ſo backward to undertake any hard &amp; difficult Service for bringing about the Salvation of Men? Moreover, do we ſee the Grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that altho' he was Rich, yet for our Sakes he became Poor, that we thro' his Poverty might be made rich? What a Shame then, that Chriſtians ſhould be backward of giving out of their Abundance, for Spreading the Knowledge of the Truth, the appointed Means of Salvation? I am perſwaded, there are many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing Chriſtians, who have not duly conſidered, what they ſhall anſwer, if Chriſt ſhould thus expoſtulate the Matter with them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Again, <hi>Conſider that a diligent Endeavour to ſpread the Goſpel of Salvation, is but a grateful Return to God our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Has Chriſt at ſo dear a Rate purchaſed Salvation for us; and has he favoured us with the Goſpel, that ſhews us the Path of Life? Surely, Gratitude to Chriſt obliges us to do what we can, for the Spreading the Goſpel: whereby Chriſt's Intereſt may increaſe, his Kingdom inlarge; and ſo his Glory be advanced.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Again, <hi>This will be but to love our Neighbour as our ſelves.</hi> Which is the Sum and Subſtance of the ſecond Table of the moral Law; and what the Goſpel of God
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:006955_0024_102AC48B890094A8"/>
our Saviour (which we enjoy,) indiſpenſably obliges unto. For who is there that loves his Neighbour as himſelf, that is not ready to do what in him lies, that his Fellow. Men may enjoy the ſame Means of Salvation, that he himſelf is favoured with.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Again, <hi>Let it be conſidered that our diligent and vigorous promoting the Salvation of others, will turn to our own good Account in the Concluſion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They who go forth upon ſuch a Service, ſhall have an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant Reward, if they have been faithful, even altho' they ſhould fail of the deſired Succeſs: But if they be the happy Means of Spreading Salvation, and of <hi>turning many to Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; they ſhall ſhine as the Firmament, and as the Stars for ever and ever,</hi> Dan. 12. 3. And as for thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend of their Subſtance in this Way, from a true Chriſtian Charity; they will find it laid out to the beſt Advantage. It will be in a Sort tranſmitting their Goods to Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore-hand; and there laid up in Store as a good Foundation againſt the Time to come. <hi>This, This,</hi> my Brethren, is the Way <hi>to make to your ſelves Friends of the Mammon of Unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs; that when ye fail, will receive you to everlaſting Habitations,</hi> Luk. 16. 9.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Again, <hi>Conſider with what Faith, or indeed with what Face. Chriſtians can pray for the Converſion and Salvation of the Heathen, without beſtirring themſelves in ſome Way or other for their coming to the Knowledge of the Truth?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Prayers muſt be accompanied with Endeavours, ſo far as it lays in the Way of Chriſtians. And they who pray for the Salvation of the Heathen; and yet have no Heart to beſtir themſelves in any Way to promote the ſame; how can they think their Prayers will find any Acceptance with God?</p>
               <p n="7">7. Finally, <hi>Conſider in what Way we can expect the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Heathen World, ſhould come to the Knowledge of the Truth, but by Perſons being ſent forth, and ſupported in that Service?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We don't except any new Revelation to be made to the World; or to have this Goſpel Revelation carried by Angels to the ignorant Heathen. This Treaſure of the Goſpel has hitherto been in, and conveyed by ſuch earthen Veſſels from
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006955_0025_102AC48D0AB6E798"/>
Place to Place. And we have no Reaſon to think it will be otherwiſe: But that when the Knowledge of the Truth ſhall ſpread, and fill the Earth, as the Waters do the Seas; it will be carried to them by Men ſubject to like Paſſions with our ſelves. And therefore Chriſtians do but fall in with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Methods, that have hitherto been, and we have Reaſon to think will be, in ſending forth and ſupporting well quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Perſons to carry the Goſpel Light to the People that ſit in Darkneſs? And we have no Reaſon to expect the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Goſpel-Truth to ſpread in the World any other Way.</p>
               <p>It muſt indeed be acknowledged that in this Way there are many Difficulties and Diſcouragements. As particularly, that they are of different Languages, that we cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand one another: And that we have not the extraordinary and miraculous Gift of Tongues, as the Apoſtles had. But to this it may be ſaid, that there is no Language, but what by Patience and Diligence may be learnt: And many Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the Sake of Trade; yea, and meerly for the Sake of appearing polite in the World, will take pains to learn a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Language. And why ſhould they not be as willing to learn a ſtrange Language, for the ſpreading Religion, and for the promoting the Salvation of Souls?</p>
               <p>And altho' ordinary Miniſters have not Power to confirm their divine Miſſion with divers Signs and Miracles, as the primitive Miniſters of Chriſt had; yet if Miniſters would now go forth with ſincere fervent Deſires to promote the Kingdom of Chriſt; They may hope for his Preſence to ſupport, aſſiſt and proſper them; and ſo to concur with the Influences of his Spirit, as that the Word they preach ſhall come with convincing Power upon the Hearts of Hearers.</p>
               <p>But if others ſhould go on to object by Way of Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, the Unſucceſsfulneſs of ſuch Miſſions in Times paſt: It may be anſwered, <hi>that</hi> ought not to diſcourage Chriſtians from going on in ſuch pious and charitable At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. It ſhould lead us indeed to conſider by what Means former Attempts have failed of the deſired Succeſs; and to correct ſuch Miſtakes as appear to have been in them: But we muſt go on ſtill in further Attempts, waiting upon God to ſet in with his almighty Spirit and Grace, to open a wide and effectual Door to ſuch faithful Miſſionaries.

Former Diſappointments ſhould by no Means hinder us from further Endeavours; for if God has not as yet in all Reſpects anſwered our Expectations; yet we know not how ſoon he may. Eccl. 11. 6. <hi>In the Morning ſow thy Seed; in the Evening keep not back; for thou knoweſt not which ſhall proſper, this or that.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10. <hi>How is God to be acknowledged; and the Memory of ſuch to be eſteemed and honoured, who have in their Life-time, or at their Death, given out of their Eſtates, for the Support and Encouragement of thoſe who ſhall carry the Knowledge of the Truth into the dark Corners of the Earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In all pious and charitable Benefactions, God is thankfully to be acknowledged: By whoſe Providence and Grace it is, that Perſons are ſtirred up, and have their Hearts enlarged to give of their worldly Goods for the Encouragement and Support of thoſe who go forth to preach the Goſpel in dark and diſtant Lands. But altho' God is to be acknowledged, and Glory given to him in the firſt Place; yet great Reſpect and Honour is due to ſuch whom God enables, in larges, and inclines to give to ſuch pious Uſes.</p>
               <p>And here I would obſerve, that under God, it is owing to ſuch pious and charitable Chriſtians in <hi>Great Britain,</hi> that the honourable Commiſſioners, and Corporation of the College, are enabled to ſend forth ſeveral Miſſionaries among the Indians, and carry the Knowledge of Goſpel Truths, and ſo the appointed Means of Salvation to them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' there has not been at all Times the deſired, and the hoped for Succeſs; yet it muſt be acknowledged to the Glory of divine Grace, that the faithful Labours of theſe Miſſionaries, have not been in vain. For many have been brought to the Knowledge of the Truth; yea, Tokens of Grace, and Things that accompany Salvation, have been found upon good Numbers of them.<note n="*" place="bottom">

And it is out of the Fund laid by our pious and charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Friends in <hi>England,</hi> that the Perſon here ſtanding Candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date for the Goſpel Miniſtry, is in a great Meaſure to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported in his Miſſion.</p>
               <p>And therefore without any further Delay, to you, <hi>Dear Sir,</hi> would I now apply my ſelf.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Indian</hi> Plantation to which you are now to be ſent, was in former Days, a very conſiderable one; and had in the very early Times of <hi>New-England,</hi> the Goſpel of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation brought to them: And many of them brought to the Knowledge, yea, it is reaſonably believed, to the ſaving Knowledge of the Truth, by the indefatigable Labours of the late aged and venerable Mr. ELIOT, who for his abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant Labours among the <hi>Indians</hi> in their ſeveral Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions about in the Country, has been ſtiled the <hi>New-England Apoſtle.</hi> After whoſe Death the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Natick</hi> were oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally inſtructed by ſome Neighbouring Miniſters: till at Length for the Space of about thirty Years paſt, the Goſpel has been preached to them in a more ſtated Way by their late worthy and faithful Paſtor, who has by his Death ceaſed from his Labours, and we truſt, gone to receive the Reward of them.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Rev. Mr. <hi>Oliver Peabody.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>And altho' the <hi>Indians</hi> have been in a declining State for many Years, as to their Numbers; yet ſtill there is a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and we hope a Remnant according to the Election of divine Grace; which together with a ſmall Number of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Inhabitants, are this Day to be committed to your Charge.</p>
               <p>And now, ſince it is the Will of God that all Men ſhould be ſaved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth as the Means thereof; it is the juſt Expectation of God and Man, that you faithfully endeavour that they may all come to, &amp; be preſerved in the Knowledge of divine, Goſpel-Truth.—We truſt &amp; hope you have felt the Power of theſe divine Truths upon your own Soul; and have a due Senſe of the Worth, the Importance, and the Neceſſity of them: And that you will endeavour that every Member of your Charge may come to the ſaving experimental Knowledge of the ſame.</p>
               <p>It is but a little Flock that you will have under your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Care: But they are ſuch as will require a great deal
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:006955_0028_102AC494C4F63F98"/>
of Pains to be taken with them, and who will need not only your publick, but more private Inſtructions, even from Houſe to Houſe. Moſt of them are but as Children in Knowledge; and ſo will require, <hi>Line upon Line; Precept upon Precept; here a little, and there a little.</hi> Let not the Smallneſs of your Flock tempt you to Slackneſs in your Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; but put you upon taking a more ſpecial Care of every Individual.</p>
               <p>You will bear it always upon your Mind, that the Truth you are to inſtruct them in, and inculcate upon them, is Goſpel-Truth; and that it will be of little Service to inſiſt upon nice Speculations, or Matters of doubtful Diſputation with them; but the grand eſſential Points of Doctrine, and the practical Truths of the Goſpel, will be more to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>And here for your quickning to Diligence and Faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I would have you conſider, that altho' but a few Souls will be committed to your immediate Care; yet they are <hi>Souls precious, and immortal Souls,</hi> and will deſerve your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Care: And you muſt be faithful in a few Things, if you would have the bleſſed <hi>Euge</hi> at laſt, and be made Ruler over many Things.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, I would obſerve to you, that as it is the <hi>Indian</hi> Intereſt, you are more eſpecially to be concerned in; and will be chiefly ſupported by Monies given for promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Knowledge of Chriſt among that poor and ſeemingly forſaken People; ſo it will very well become you to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe your Thoughts and Cares, not meerly for the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Natick;</hi> but that you have at Heart the Intereſt of Religion among the <hi>Indians</hi> in all Parts of the Land; and endeavour as you have Opportunity to promote and encourage the Spreading the Goſpel among thoſe diſtant Tribes, which do ſtill lie in Ignorance.</p>
               <p>And Oh! may the happy Times come, when Perſons ſhall be raiſed up, qualified for, and ſpirited to carry the Everlaſting Goſpel of Truth, to all the dark Corners of our Land: That ſo the poor ignorant Tribes of <hi>Indians,</hi> may be turned from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:006955_0029_102AC4964AAB8970"/>
As for the Eaſtern Tribes, to the Shame of Proteſtants it muſt be ſpoken; That the Romiſh Prieſts were more early, and more earneſt in ſpreading their Principles among them, than we Proteſtants have been. By which Means they have gained ſuch Prepoſſeſſions, and ſtirred up ſuch Prejudices in them, that it is become exceeding difficult to perſwade them now to ſtrip their Religion of thoſe Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Errors and Deluſions that have been impoſed upon them, and to embrace the plain and ſimple <hi>Truth as it is in Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as for the Weſtern Tribes, they have been hitherto, moſt ſhamefully neglected: And would to God, that the Engliſh Government which lies neareſt to them, would ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſider how they will anſwer it, another Day; that they have done ſo little to propagate Chriſtian Knowledge among them: But that inſtead thereof ſo many Blocks and Diſcouragements have been laid in the Way to hinder others from undertaking and engaging in ſo good a Work.</p>
               <p>And I think it highly becomes <hi>This,</hi> and all the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Governments, to exert themſelves with Speed and Vigour in this Matter; that thoſe poor People, who have for unknown Ages ſat in Darkneſs, in the Region, and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Death, might at Length have the great and glorious Light of the Goſpel ſpring up among them. I ſay, we ought to be <hi>ſpeedy</hi> as well as vigorous in our Endeavours in this Matter; before our French Neighbours ſhall ſpread An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian Errors and Prejuices among them; which we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand they are at this Day earneſtly ſtriving for.</p>
               <p>O let us not be more backward to ſpread <hi>Truth, the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Truths of the Goſpel;</hi> than they are to ſpread dangerous Errors: But let us out of an hearty Regard for the Honour and Intereſt of Jeſus Chriſt, and out of a Love to the poor and periſhing Souls of theſe <hi>Indians,</hi> take ſome effectual Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to ſend the Goſpel in its Purity among them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And by this Means we ſhall be in the Way not only of doing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable Benefit to them; but of reaping great Advantage to our ſelves thereby: This being the moſt likely Method to ſecure Peace, and maintain a friendly Correſpondence with them. But altho' this political Argument may very properly be thought of by us, and have conſiderable Weight with us;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:006955_0030_102AC499A1764CA8"/>
yet the other Arguments, ſuch as the Honour of Chriſt, and the ſaving Good of their Souls, are the higher and more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Motives, and ought to have the principal Sway with us. And indeed, if true Chriſtian, gracious and generous Love, did but glow with a ſacred Ardor in the Breaſts of Chriſtians, theſe poor <hi>Indians</hi> would not lie neglected; but ſome pious Candidates for the Goſpel Miniſtry, would ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerouſly offer themſelves, ſaying, one and another of them, <hi>Here am I, ſend me.</hi> And others would readily contribute of their Eſtates to the laying ſome generous Fund, for the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of ſuch Miſſionaries and School-Maſters, as ſhall thus offer themſelves.</p>
               <p>Oh! that ſuch a Love to Chriſt and to our Fellow-Men, might be ſhed Abroad in the Souls of the People of this, and the Neighbouring Governments, as well as in the <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Realms: And that ſome effectual Methods, under the divine Conduct and Bleſſing, might be come into, for ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Goſpel to all the Aboriginal Natives of the Land.</p>
               <p>And may ſuch a Zeal for the Glory of God, and the Good of Mankind, be ſo ſtirred up thro' all Chriſtendom, as to put them upon endeavouring with their Might, that the ſaving Truths of the Goſpel, may be ſent to all the Heathen Nation upon the Earth. Wherefore with our vigorous En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in our ſeveral Places, let us join our earneſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, with the devout Wiſhes of the Pſalmiſt, for enlarging the Church and Kingdom of God in the World, Pſal. 67. 1,2,3. <hi>God be merciful to us, and bleſs us, and cauſe his Face to ſhine upon us: That thy Way may be known upon Earth, and thy ſaving Health among all Nations! Let the People praiſe thee, O God! Let ALL the People Praiſe Thee.</hi>

               <hi>Pray for all Men,</hi> for Kings, and for all in Authority; that we may lead a quiet and peaceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</p>
