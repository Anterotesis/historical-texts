            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An Ordination Sermon.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <bibl>JOHN <hi>xviii. 37.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>To this end was I born, and for this cauſe came I into the world, that I ſhould bear witneſs unto the truth.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE are the words of our bleſſed Saviour. In them he informs us, that one end of his incarnation and miniſtry was, that by bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the truth, he might communicate the knowledge of it. The ſame is doubtleſs the end of the ordinary miniſtry of the goſpel, and ſhould be the object aimed at by every Miniſter. From our text therefore I deduce this <hi>doctrine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great duty of the Miniſters of the Goſpel is, to preach the truth.</p>
            <p>Under this doctrine I purpoſe,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To ſhow what truth miniſters of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel ought to preach.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028618_0003_0FD9C6E487D68010"/>II. To mention ſome reaſons in confirmation of the doctrine.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to ſhow what truth a miniſter of the goſpel ought to preach. Truth is very extenſive and of various kinds. There is truth in every ſcience, in mathematics, philoſophy, hiſtory, &amp;c. It will not be pretended, that mathematical and philoſophical truth is the proper ſubject of the evangelical miniſtry. Nor is hiſtorical truth, any further than it illuſtrates the goſpel, by exhibiting the facts of it, or other important facts relating to the works and the character of God.</p>
            <p>The truth then intended in the doctrine is pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily evangelical truth, and ſecondarily all other truth which relates to the goſpel and tends to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate it; as all truth relating to God and his character, eſpecially his moral perfections; all truth relating to his ſupreme, univerſal and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign government; all truth relating to his law, its requirements and threatenings; relating to ſin, its nature and evil; relating to ourſelves, our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent fallen ſtate, and the ruin conſequent on the fall; particularly our native and total depravity, our actual ſins and the various aggravations of them; our demerit as ſinners; our dependence on the mere mercy and ſovereign grace of God; our own moral inability to bring ourſelves to repentance and holineſs of heart and life, and our abſolute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency to make ſatisfaction for our ſins; the neceſſity of an atonement and one of infinite val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, correſpondent to the demerit of our ſin; the character of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, his divinity, his humanity, his offices, his ſufferings in our ſtead, and his readineſs to ſave ſinners of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028618_0004_0FD9C6E80F5B4258"/>
every deſcription, who come to him for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; the conditions of his ſalvation, the privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and rewards of it, and the inevitable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of a rejection of it.</p>
            <p>This is a very brief ſummary of the truths, which every miniſter of the goſpel is obligated to preach and inculcate.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I am to mention ſome reaſons in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this doctrine.</p>
            <p>The following reaſons ſhow, that miniſters of the goſpel are obliged to preach the truth or the real doctrines of ſcripture.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The truth was the ſubject of the preaching of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. He certainly is a proper example in this, as well as in his common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct. He was a perfect preacher. Therefore he is to be imitated by all other preachers. And he in our text, informs us not only that he preached the truth, but that this was one great end of his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation and miniſtry.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſame was the ſubject of the preaching of the apoſtles and prophets. 2 Cor. iv. 2. <q>We have renounced the hidden things of diſhoneſty, not walking in craftineſs, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by manifeſtation of the <hi>truth</hi> commending ourſelves to every man's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in the ſight of God.</q> Chap. xiii. 8. <q>For we can do nothing againſt the <hi>truth,</hi> but for the <hi>truth.</hi>
               </q> Gal. iv. 16. <q>Am I therefore become your enemy, becauſe I tell you the truth?</q> 1 Tim. ii. 7. <q>Whereunto I am or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
<pb facs="unknown:028618_0005_0FD9C6E90B9B2160"/>
a preacher and an apoſtle—a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and <hi>verity;</hi>
               </q> i. e. in faith and <hi>truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great buſineſs of the prophets was to declare the word of God, which is the truth, as it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately taught them, or as they were by God di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to repeat former revelations. The great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the apoſtles was to preach the goſpel, which is the ſyſtem of divine truth given to the church and to the world, in the laſt and moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diſpenſation. Both the prophets and apoſtles were inſpired by the infallible ſpirit of God which guided them into all neceſſary truth, and preſerved them, in their official proceedings, from every thing inconſiſtent with it. Under the influence of this ſpirit they preached the truth and that only.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The knowledge of the truth is neceſſary to true religion. It is neceſſary both to the affections and to the practice of it.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) The knowledge of the truth is neceſſary to true religious affections.—The knowledge of the true God is neceſſary to the true love of God. That love of God, which implies true virtue and real holineſs, is the love of the true God and of the true and real character of God. To love any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the true character of God, is as really to love a falſe God as to love <hi>Jupiter</hi> or <hi>Dagon.</hi> For inſtance to love God as a perfectly holy and wiſe God, is a holy affection; but to love him as one who tolerates and connives at ſin and ſaves all at laſt, whatever their lives and characters be in this world, is a wrong and ſinful affection. To love God as a benevolent being, aiming at his own
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028618_0006_0FD9C6F0840192E0"/>
glory conſiſting in the good and happineſs of the intellectual ſyſtem, is a right and holy affection. But to love him in the idea, that he is aiming at ſome partial, private good, or our own particular good only, is no exerciſe of true virtue, but a mere love of ourſelves or of ſome party. Therefore we muſt have the knowledge of the truth in this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant particular, and juſt ideas of the divine character, in order to the exerciſe of true virtue and religion in the love of God.</p>
            <p>Similar obſervations may be made concerning the divine law. If we believe that it forbids and condemns ſome ſins only, and in that view love it, there is in that love no true religion, but irreligion. If we believe it forbids all ſin and love it in that view, that is true virtue and religion. If we love the divine law, becauſe we believe it denounces ſome ſmall temporary puniſhment, and cannot bear it, as threatening an endleſs puniſhment, we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſhow, that we are not friends, but enemies to the law and the truth.</p>
            <p>We muſt believe, that there is a God, or we cannot love him at all. We muſt believe, that Jeſus Chriſt is the Saviour, or we cannot receive and truſt in him as our Saviour. We muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the ſcriptures, or how ſhall we receive and comply with them? We muſt believe that we are ſinners, or we can never repent. We muſt believe the atonement, or we ſhall never depend on it, nor ſeek forgiveneſs and ſalvation on the ground of it. And ſo with reſpect to every other truth of the goſpel. We can have no right exerciſe or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in view of any truth, unleſs we know and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that truth.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:028618_0007_0FD9C6F086361A68"/>(2) The knowledge of the truth is neceſſary to all genuine religious practice.—Genuine practice implies genuine affections, and is founded on them. Therefore without repeating, it is ſufficient to ſay, that the knowledge of the truth is neceſſary to gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine religious practice, for the ſame reaſons, that it is neceſſary to genuine religious affections.</p>
            <p>Having thus briefly illuſtrated the doctrine, and having mentioned ſome reaſons in confirmation of it, I proceed to ſeveral inferences, which were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed principally intended, in the choice of this ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hence we ſee the groundleſſneſs of a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment holden and advanced by many in theſe days, that it is of no importance what a man's religious creed or ſentiments are, provided he be an honeſt man and ſincere in his religion.—Let us examine this ſentiment.</p>
            <p>By an honeſt man in this propoſition muſt be meant, either one who is honeſt and juſt in matters of property; or one who in his religion profeſſes and acts as he thinks If the latter be meant, then an honeſt man and one who is ſincere in his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are the very ſame; and then the propoſition now under conſideration is this, that it is of no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance what a man's religious ſentiments are, provided that in his religion he believes as he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes and does what he believes to be right. But this any man may do, let his religion be what it will. A Papiſt, a Mahometan or a Pagan may be equally ſincere in this ſenſe, as the beſt Chriſtian: and if this ſincerity be all which is neceſſary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; then all kinds of religions, as to that
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028618_0008_0FD9C6F2DE834398"/>
which is eſſential to true religion and the benefits of it, are perfectly alike; and of courſe it is a matter of indifferency which we embrace and which we reject, if we embrace any. But this cannot be reconciled with either ſcripture or reaſon. Many of the ancient worſhippers of Dagon and Baal, and of the gods many and lords many, ſo called, were very ſincere and in good earneſt in their worſhip; yet they are every where condemned in ſcripture, as they are alſo by the voice of reaſon.</p>
            <p>But perhaps it will be ſaid, that in the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it is of no importance what a man's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſentiments are, provided he be an honeſt man and ſincere in his religion; by honeſty is meant moral honeſty, or juſtice to man in matters of property. If this be intended, then the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is this, that juſtice to men together with the forementioned ſincerity, is the whole of religion. But we ſee by what has been ſaid already, that the forementioned ſincerity is no part of true religion, and that in this reſpect it is juſt nothing at all. Therefore if juſtice to men with this ſincerity be the whole of religion; as this ſincerity is no part of true religion, the whole of it muſt center in mere juſtice to men. But this cannot be reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with either ſcripture or reaſon. The ſcripture requires us to render not only unto Ceſar the things which are Ceſar's, but alſo unto God, the things which are God's: and the Jews in the time of the prophet Malachi, were ſeverely reproved for having robbed God. Mal. ii. 8. <q>Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye ſay, wherein have we robbed thee? In tythes and offerings.</q> Yea, the ſcripture requires us to
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028618_0009_0FD9C6F5D84030E0"/>
love the Lord our God with all our heart. And it is perfectly rational, that if he be ſupremely great, good and glorious; if he be our Creator, our chief and conſtant benefactor; he ſhould be the object of our firſt and chief regard. So that juſtice to men and a mere moral life, are ſo far from the whole of religion, that they are not the principal part of it.</p>
            <p>That it is of no importance what a man's reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſentiments are, is ſo far from the truth, that nothing is more manifeſt, than that thoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt daily influence his religious feelings and affections, and conſequently his practice. If a man believe, that he is dependant on divine grace for a renovation, ſanctification and forgiveneſs, this naturally tends to humble him. But if he believe, that he is in no need of divine grace in any of theſe reſpects, he muſt neceſſarily feel ſo far ſelf-ſufficient, ſo far independent, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly muſt be ſpiritually proud and ſelf-righteous. If he believe the neceſſity of the atonement of Chriſt; this powerfully perſuades him to look thither and to place his dependence there. If he believe not the neceſſity of the atonement, we may be ſure he will depend on ſome other foundation. If he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that God will pardon, and is by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite goodneſs bound to pardon, any ſinner in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of his repentance merely, without a Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator; he will certainly neglect Chriſt as the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator. But if he believe, that a Mediator is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, and that there is no other name but that of Chriſt, given under heaven among men, whereby we can be ſaved, what can more ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urge him to receive and truſt in Chriſt? Thus as a man thinketh in his heart, ſo is he; ſuch is
<pb facs="unknown:028618_0010_0FD9C6FB11376CC8"/>
his real character; and no man can commonly be expected to be better than his principles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hence we ſee the miſtake of thoſe who hold, that we need not know much of the doctrines of chriſtianity; that it is not uſeful either for the purpoſe of conviction to ſinners or edification to ſaints, that ſuch knowledge rather tends to ſtifle and prevent both conviction and edification; that we may be juſt as good chriſtians without that knowledge as with it; yea better, becauſe it rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er obſtructs chriſtian experience and exerciſe, and quenches chriſtian zeal and fervour.</p>
            <p>But on candid examination it will be found, that this is a great miſtake; and that the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of divine truth is of a moſt happy tendency both to the conviction of ſinners and the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſaints. Certainly the knowledge of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence and character of God, of his holineſs and his will, of his law and of our violations of it, of the righteouſneſs and goodneſs of the law, of the puniſhment and evil of ſin, of the grace of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and of our neglect of that grace, moſt directly tends to produce and increaſe conviction. Indeed genuine conviction cannot exiſt without knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of this kind; and whatever fear or terror, without the knowledge of the truth, exiſts in any man's mind, which ſome call conviction, is mere enthuſiaſm and not genuine conviction.</p>
            <p>The knowledge of the truth is equally uſeful and neceſſary to edification as to conviction. The neceſſity of it to this, I before endeavoured to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate. How can we love God, if we know him not? or believe in Chriſt, without the knowledge
<pb facs="unknown:028618_0011_0FD9C6FE8AB0D4E8"/>
or him? and ſo in every inſtance of chriſtian ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe. And the more we know of God, the more opportunity and the greater motives we have, to love, fear and ſerve him. The more we know of his glorious majeſty and ſovereignty, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he grea<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> motive we have to adore, praiſe and ſubmit to him. The more the chriſtian knows of the divine law, the more will he naturally delight in it after the inward man. The more he knows of Chriſt, his grace, ſufficiency and fulneſs, the more will he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice and truſt in him. And ſo with reſpect to all divine truth. Juſt as a man, who has a taſte for muſic, or poetry, or the fine arts in general, is more delighted, the more he is inſtructed in thoſe arts, and his taſte for them and for their peculiar and moſt delightful excellencies, is the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</p>
            <p>So that there is no foundation for the imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that the knowledge of chriſtian doctrines tends to obſtruct either conviction or edification. Indeed that kind of conviction and edification, which is not built on the foundation of the truth, but of imagination, is obſtructed by the knowledge of the truth and will naturally be aboliſhed by it. And the ſooner ſuch conviction and edification are aboliſhed, the better, as they are not favourable to true religion, but to enthuſiaſm and falſe relgion, which ſo far as they obtain, lead aſtray from the footſteps of the flock, and this ſtraying may be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal to the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence we infer the duty of all, who live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the light of the goſpel, diligently to ſtudy the doctrines of it and of the whole word of God.— This is the way to know more of God, of his law,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028618_0012_0FD9C701CE15D1D8"/>
of his will, of Chriſt and of the free and infinite grace of God, and the way to greater joy in them and conformity to them. This is the way to know more of our own vileneſs as ſinners, and to be more humble in the view of it. This is the way to know more of our duty and of the motives to the performance of it. But the knowledge of all theſe objects tends moſt directly to our edification in the chriſtian life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Eſpecially are miniſters of the goſpel under obligation to the careful ſtudy of its doctrines. Their principal buſineſs, as has been attempted to be illuſtrated, is to preach and teach the truth. But how ſhall they be able to teach the truth, if they be ignorant of it themſelves? And the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of it is to be obtained in no other way, than by a diligent ſtudy of the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>Beſides, they ought to ſeek their own edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are at leaſt under equal obligation to this, as other men. Nay, their obligation is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in proportion to their greater advantages for edification, and the greater advantage which their own edification gives them, to promote that of others.</p>
            <p>Yet not only are ſome miniſters too negligent of this duty of thoroughly ſtudying the doctrines of ſcripture; but ſome deſignedly avoid it. They mean to preach <hi>practically</hi> and not to puzzle their people with <hi>deep</hi> doctrines. No doubt that preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is truly practical, is the beſt and moſt uſeful. But that a miniſter may preach practical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and moſt uſefully, it is not neceſſary, that he be ignorant of the doctrines of the goſpel; nor is it
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:028618_0013_0FD9C70356ACBBB8"/>
neceſſary, that he ſhould not preach thoſe doctrines. That is the moſt practical preaching, which moſt happily conduces to promote chriſtian experience and practice<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that preaching moſt happily conduces to promote theſe, which is founded on the truth and which urges all the motives and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which the truth affords, to excite to chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian experience and practice; and any other argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that theſe are not proper to be urged, nor do they on the whole lead to chriſtian experience and practice, but to enthuſiaſm, and ultimately to irreligion and infidelity.</p>
            <p>Some ſeem to conceive, that it is a miniſter's du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>exhort</hi> only, and urge and preſs his hearers to become and to live as chriſtians. But are theſe exhortations to be preſſed with motives drawn from the truth or from falſehood? The latter will not be pretended; and as there is no medium in the caſe, they muſt be preſſed with arguments drawn from the truth only. And in order to this the truth muſt be known, muſt be ſearched out by ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and muſt be taught; which is the very thing for which I plead. The mind cannot be rational<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded by any other means, than by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the truth; nor indeed ought it.</p>
            <p>Therefore for a miniſter to neglect his ſtudies, on this principle, that the knowledge of divine truth is not neceſſary or uſeful to enable him to preach practically and uſefully, is to proceed on ground that will by no means ſupport him. The only truly practical and uſeful preaching is that which is founded on the truth and is enforced with arguments drawn from it; and to ſuch
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028618_0014_0FD9C70691BC8AE8"/>
preaching a knowledge and diligent ſtudy of the truths and doctrines of the goſpel, are neceſſary.</p>
            <p>For a miniſter to neglect the ſtudy of thoſe truths from <hi>indolence,</hi> is ſtill worſe; it is inexcuſable. Miniſters are bound to be at leaſt as induſtrious as other men, and many arguments might be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned why they ſhould, if their health admit, be ſtill more induſtrious.</p>
            <p>But it is to be feared, that ſome neglect ſtudy on a ſtill different principle. They are afraid, that if they ſtudy thoroughly and attend to what has been or may be ſaid on certain important ſubjects, they ſhall be convinced, that thoſe doctrines are true, which in ſome places are extremely unpopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. Therefore they do not wiſh to be convinced of their truth, and will not attend to them, leſt they ſhould be convinced; or leſt they ſhould be under a neceſſity of giving their opinion concerning them, and thus expoſe themſelves to the cenſure of one party or the other, either the advocates or the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of thoſe doctrines. For this reaſon they will not read thoſe books, in which thoſe doctrines are contained, nor converſe much with thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who hold them. And if they be aſked their opinion, they make this apology for not giving it, that they have not read the books, nor examined the arguments relating to thoſe doctrines: and of ſet purpoſe they avoid to do either.</p>
            <p>Now can this be juſtified? What is this but ſhutting their eyes againſt the light? And how can this be done with a good conſcience? Are we not commanded to <q>prove all things, and to hold faſt that which is good?</q>—Beſides; this conduct
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028618_0015_0FD9C70AD30D8488"/>
argues a want of liberality of ſentiment, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractedneſs, which it is preſumed, they who act in this manner, would not wiſh to have imputed to them. A man of true liberality of ſentiment and feeling, is willing to hear both ſides of every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant queſtion, and is not afraid that he ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive too much light.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Hence we learn, that it is the duty of miniſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ters of the goſpel, to preach the truth <hi>plainly</hi> and in a manner that is intelligible to their people in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral.—I have endeavoured to ſhow, that it is their principal duty to preach the truth: but to preach it in obſcure and unintelligible terms is not very different from not preaching it at all. The words of the apoſtle Paul are worthy of notice in this caſe, 1 Cor. xiv. 19. <q>In the church I had rather ſpeak five words with my underſtanding, that with my voice I might teach others alſo, than ten thouſand words in an unknown tongue.</q> Nor ought we to be deterred from preaching any eſſential truth, by the conſideration, that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popular. Every truth of the goſpel in its proper connection is oppoſed to the carnal heart, and with carnal men will be unpopular. Therefore if we proceed on this ground, we muſt ſuppreſs every truth.</p>
            <p>Indeed ſome preachers, it is confeſſed, act an imprudent part. They declare the moſt offenſive truths in the moſt offenſive terms, and in thoſe terms, againſt which their hearers or many of them are greatly prejudiced, and which they really miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtand, having been long accuſtomed to affix to them a wrong meaning. This is not to teach the truth; but it is the way to prevent the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:028618_0016_0FD9C70CE3B18AF0"/>
of it; and the way not to do good but hurt. There are two extremes in this, as in other caſes. One is not to declare important and uſeful truth faithfully: the other is to declare it, either in words not underſtood in the ſenſe, in which they are u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the ſpeaker, or before the hearers are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive it, by having learnt other truths neceſſary previouſly to be known.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is the ſentiment and doctrine of ſome, that on all diſputable points, miniſters ſhould preach in ſcripture language; that this would be a happy way to avoid all diſputes in religion: that all public formulas, creeds, confeſſions and doctrines of faith, ſhould be drawn up in ſcripture-language entirely; that thus chriſtians would be agreed, and diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, parties and ſeparations would be at an end.— Let us conſider this matter.—It is ſaid that on <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable points</hi> miniſters ſhould preach in ſcripture-language only. But all the peculiar and the moſt important doctrines of the goſpel are diſputable. And ſhall miniſters do nothing toward teaching thoſe doctrines, beſide reading the ſcriptures to their people? All who can read, as all, or almoſt all among us can, may read them for themſelves. Yet the ſentiment now under conſideration will come to this, that miniſters are to do nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward public inſtruction, beſide publicly reading the ſcriptures. For if they muſt uſe ſcripture-lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage only on all the moſt important ſubjects, why not on all the leſs important? What advantage is there in deviating from the words of ſcripture in the latter caſe, more than in the former? And if one word, which is not ſcriptural, may be uſed in the pulpit, why not another? and where ſhall we fix the limits.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:028618_0017_0FD9C7101254BFC0"/>Beſides this ſentiment will not only exclude from the pulpit all words and phraſes, which are not u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in ſcripture; but it will confine us to uſe the words of ſcripture in the very ſame order in which they ſtand in ſcripture. The deſign of uſing the mere language of ſcripture is, to alter not the ſenſe of it and to avoid all diſputes concerning that ſenſe and concerning the doctrines of chriſtianity. But though we uſe the words of ſcripture only, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> if we ſhift their arrangement, we may alter their ſenſe entirely; and this not only by altering the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of the words of particular ſentences; but by ſelecting and arranging ſentences them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. So that mere uſing ſcripture words and phraſes, whether in preaching or in our public formulas, will not anſwer the end intended, unleſs we preſerve the exact order, as well as the words of ſcripture; that is, unleſs we merely <hi>read</hi> the ſcripture.</p>
            <p>Some ſenſible of this conſequence of their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, have avowed it with regard to public for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulas. But to be conſiſtent, they muſt avow it with regard to all teaching in religion, and muſt hold, that there ſhould be no religious inſtruction, beſide the reading of the ſcriptures.</p>
            <p>In defence of this doctrine it has been ſaid, that the language of ſcripture was choſen by omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience, and is therefore the beſt poſſible; that it is in vain therefore to attempt to mend or explain it by words of our own chooſing; that we might as well attempt to mend any other of the works of God. But all this goes on the ground of the impropriety of our uſing any other means of religious inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, than the reading of the ſcriptures; a ground
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028618_0018_0FD9C7124835B328"/>
on which thoſe who uſe this reaſoning, will not dare to reſt their cauſe.</p>
            <p>As to the alledged abſurdity of explaining the language of ſcripture, which is ſaid to be equal to an attempt to mend or improve the other <hi>works</hi> of God; I obſerve, that in a certain ſenſe we may and do daily improve the works of God. No man imagines that there is any impiety or abſurdity in clearing and cultivating his lands, or in grinding his grain into meal and making it into bread. Yet there is as much of both impiety and abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity in either of theſe, as in explaining by the uſe of other words, ſuch texts as theſe, <q>The plowers have plowed on my back and made long their furrows;</q> and <q>He that believeth on me as the ſcripture hath ſaid, out of his belly ſhall flow riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of living water.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though the language of ſcripture was doubtleſs the beſt poſſible on the whole; yet this does not prove but that other words may be uſed in a variety of inſtances, which will better explain the meaning of ſcripture, at leaſt to many particular perſons or ſocieties of men, than the words of ſcripture them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. A word or phraſe which is very deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in one place or nation, may be very ambig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous in another. Nor was it poſſible for omniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience itſelf to make a ſelection of words, which would not be liable to this inconvenience in the preſent ſtate of mankind, any more than it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for omniſcience to give a revelation, which could not be abuſed and perverted by depraved men. Now, when a word or phraſe of ſcripture is become ambiguous in a particular age or country, there is no abſurdity in ſuppoſing, that this word
<pb facs="unknown:028618_0019_0FD9C7165A9D33B0"/>
or phraſe ſhould be explained by other words or phraſes, which in that age and country are not ſo ambiguous; though with reſpect to all ages and all countries, the laſt ſuppoſed words and phraſes may not be ſo clear and uſeful, as thoſe, which they are uſed in a particular time and place to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Hence we infer that miniſters are not bound to preach <hi>plain</hi> things only.—This is the idea of ſome; and that miniſters ought never to meddle with things which are not plain.—But unleſs this be ſo explained, as to be nothing but what all will grant, it can never be ſupported. If by plain things, be meant things which are already plain and well known to the hearers, then a miniſter is never to <hi>teach</hi> his people any thing; and he is bound to preach ſo to them, that they ſhall not, under his preaching, make the leaſt <hi>improvement</hi> in chriſtian knowledge; which is abſurd and what no man will undertake to ſupport. But if by <hi>plain things</hi> be meant, things which are capable of being made plain to the hearers, or which, if they will be attentive and candid, may, by the evidence of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or revelation, be made to appear to be credible and manifeſt truths; it is granted, that in this ſenſe a miniſter muſt preach plain things only. But the propoſition thus explained, comes to nothing.</p>
            <p n="8">8. Alſo hence we ſee the abſurdity of parents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to teach their children any particular ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents in religion, even thoſe which they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves believe; and leaving them to judge for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without any ſuch inſtruction. This is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocated and practiſed by ſome, on the pretences, that their children have a right of private judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:028618_0020_0FD9C718448E6D78"/>
in religion and a liberty of conſcience; that teaching them any particular religious ſentiments would curtail this liberty, would ſhackle their judgment and their genius, and would prevent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement. But theſe reaſons, if they prove any thing, prove too much, and ſo confute themſelves. Children grown to a proper age have a right to judge for themſelves in politics, as well as religion. They have a right to judge, whether monarchy or democracy, whether a free or a deſpotic govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be the beſt. Alſo they have a right to judge for themſelves in morals, whether it be beſt and obligatory on them, to be temperate and prudent, and to obſerve truth and juſtice in their intercourſe with their fellow-men. Yet no man will be tho't to curtail his ſon's right of private judgment or his liberty of conſcience, by teaching him the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of true civil liberty, or the moral duties of temperance, prudence and juſtice. Nay, our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren at a proper age, have a right to judge for themſelves what buſineſs to follow in life and in what manner to carry it on. Yet no man ſcruples to bring up his ſon to ſome particular buſineſs. Nor does any man imagine, that he curtails the liberty of his ſon, by educating him for a ſcholar, an huſbandman or a mechanic. Nor is it ever thought that if parents educate their children to ſome particular buſineſs, they cramp their genius or prevent improvement. On the principle which I am conſidering, a parent muſt never teach his ſon any thing. Though he wiſh to have him an huſbandman, he muſt never teach him the uſe of the plough or ſcythe; though he wiſh to have him a carpenter, he muſt never teach the uſe of the ſaw or chiſel; though he wiſh to have him a ſcholar, he muſt never teach him to read or write:
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:028618_0021_0FD9C719C36D7CB8"/>
for the ſon has the ſame right of private judgment concerning the beſt mode of reading and writing, and of uſing any kind of utenſils, which he has to judge in matters of religion; and teaching him any of the things juſt mentioned would be as likely to prevent improvement by cramping his genius, as teaching him the principles of chriſtianity.</p>
            <p>As theſe ideas of the education of children are contrary to reaſon, they are equally contrary to ſcripture. That commands us to <q>train up a child in the way he ſhould go,</q> with encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that <q>when he is old, he ſhall not depart from it,</q> and to <q>bring up our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some allow indeed, that children are to be taught that the ſcriptures are the word of God; but are not to be taught the particular doctrines contained in the ſcriptures; that as to the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and contents of the ſcriptures, they are to judge entirely for themſelves. But why are they not to be taught, as well that the ſcriptures con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch and ſuch particular doctrines, as that the ſcriptures themſelves are the word of God? They have the ſame right of private judgment in the one of theſe caſes as the other. To teach our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that the ſcriptures are the word of God, and not to teach them any of the particular doctrines of ſcripture, is like carefully teaching them that a certain volume contains the laws of our country; but at the ſame time cautiouſly avoiding to teach them any of the laws which are contained in that volume: or teaching them, that huſbandry is the beſt buſineſs of life; yet not teaching them any thing in particular concerning huſbandry.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:028618_0022_0FD9C71D8385F270"/>9. If miniſters be bound to teach the truths and doctrines of the goſpel; people are bound to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, to hear and learn thoſe truths. If miniſters be bound to take great pains to teach, people are bound to take correſpondent pains to learn and to acquire knowledge. Theſe duties mutually imply each other, and it is abſurd to ſeparate them.</p>
            <p>For the ſame reaſons people are bound to ſeek for a miniſter who will <hi>inſtruct</hi> them: and divine grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though eſſential to the character of a good miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, is not ſufficient to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute that character.

            <p>I ſhall now cloſe this diſcourſe with an addreſs, firſt to the paſtor elect, and then to the church and ſociety in this place.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To the paſtor elect—</p>
            <p>MY DEAR SIR,</p>
            <p>I have endeavored to repreſent the importance and neceſſity of preaching the truth; and have done it with a ſpecial reference to you. We who are in the miniſtry are always liable to temptation, as in other reſpects, ſo in faithfully preaching the truth. And the very circumſtance, which in itſelf is ſo agreeable, that there is ſo great and cordial an unanimity among this people, with reſpect to your ſettlement among them, may increaſe your temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It may make you more remiſs in your ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and more negligent in faithfully declaring the truth. It may put you off your guard, and thus you may expoſe yourſelf and expoſe the cauſe of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028618_0023_0FD9C7208431DE28"/>
truth. It may be an occaſion of a preſumptuous conduct or mode of preaching; or on the other hand, it may be the occaſion of making you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſively compliant, ſo as to ſuppreſs important and uſeful truth, in order to preſerve the preſent peace and unanimity. I beſeech you to avoid all theſe, <q>to hold faſt the form of ſound words once delivered to the ſaints,</q> and not to be ſeduced from them by any temptation. Yet preach the truth prudently and with circumſpection. All things that are lawful, are not expedient. Beware of preaching ſo as to be miſunderſtood by the uſe of terms, to which your people have affixed ideas different from your own. Dwell not perpetually on a few favorite topics. All evangelical truth is divine; all is uſeful.</p>
            <p>That you may thus preach, read extenſively. "Beware of the man who reads but one book," is an old and ſenſible obſervation. By reading ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſively you will ſee not only what truth others have taught, but what errors they have taught, and the reaſons with which they have endeavored to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port thoſe errors. Thus you will know how the better to guard againſt thoſe errors, and to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the contrary truth.</p>
            <p>You are to teach the truth not only in the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, but day by day in your walk and converſation. Thus not only you will ſhow, that you believe what you preach, but you will add force to it.</p>
            <p>You, as well as miniſters in general, will have great need of prudence in all your conduct, and of keeping the entire maſtry of yourſelf. <q>He that ruleth his ſpirit, is greater than he that taketh a
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028618_0024_0FD9C72627AE3400"/>

If we do not keep under our paſſions and feelings, our enemies will not fail to take the advantage of us. This therefore, in caſe of oppoſition, you are to expect; and the conſequence may be fatal to your comfort and uſefulneſs in this place, and det<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental to the cauſe of truth in general. But if agreeably to our Lord's direction, you be wiſe as a ſerpent and harmleſs as a dove; if you preach the truth faithfully and feel and live accordingly, you may hope for a bleſſing on your miniſtry. But however this may be, you will be accepted and approved by the great ſhepherd of the ſheep, who will ſay to you at laſt, <q>Well done, thou good and faithful ſervant; thou haſt been faithful over a few things; be thou ruler over many things; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</q>

            <p>MEN and BRETHREN,</p>
            <p>You have heard what has been ſaid to your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor elect and the exhortation to him, to preach the truth. If he be bound to preach the truth, you are bound to hear, receive and obey it. If he ſhall faithfully preach it, he will be accepted by his God and Judge, whether you hear or forbear. You are now to have another paſtor ſet over you in the Lord. This is one of the gifts which Chriſt has received and which he diſpenſes in conſequence of his aſcenſion: and you are accountable for the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028618_0025_0FD9C72744FB8B10"/>
manner in which you ſhall improve by this gift. Your paſtor is to be a watchman on this part of the walls of Jeruſalem, to give warning to you. If he ſhall faithfully warn you and you ſhall not hear nor regard, your blood will be on your own heads. But if you ſhall hear and comply, you ſhall live. Therefore take heed how you hear. <q>Incline your ear and come unto Chriſt. Hear and your ſouls ſhall live; and he will make with you an everlaſting covenant, even the ſure mercies of David.</q>

            <head>The Charge given by the <hi>REV. SIMON WATERMAN,</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>PLYMOUTH.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>OUR Lord Jeſus Chriſt, having ſuffered on the croſs, and thereby purchaſed the church with his own blood: before his aſcenſion into Heaven, gave gifts to men, as apoſtles, and proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and evangeliſts, and paſtors, and teachers: for the perfecting of the ſaints, for the work of the miniſtry and edification of the church.</p>
            <p>The apoſtles who were the firſt miniſters of Chriſt, were called, commiſſioned, and furniſhed, for the work to which they were called, in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and ſupernatural way: and in this their extraordinary character of apoſtles, they left no ſucceſſors: for ſince the gift of inſpiration, and the power of miracles have ceaſed; the only or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of public teachers in the chriſtian church, is that of paſtors, elders, or biſhops; appellations, names and titles, evidently ſynonimous, and in the new teſtament, given indifferently to officers of the ſame order and rank in Chriſt's viſible kingdom.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of theſe officers is, to overſee, and feed the church of God; giving themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to prayer, and to the miniſtry of the word: and according to our Saviour's promiſe they will continue, in a regular ſucceſſion, to the end of time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:028618_0027_0FD9C68C055497F0"/>The work to which miniſters of the goſpel are called, is of great, very great importance. The honour of God; the advancement of the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers kingdom, the ſalvation of their own ſouls and that of others, are events cloſely connected with their employment, and greatly depend on the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which they fulfil it. As ſtewards they muſt give account of their ſtewardſhip. They watch for ſouls, one of which is of more worth than all the world beſide; and they muſt account for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoul committed to their keeping. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations led Paul to ſay, who is ſufficient for theſe things? and theſe conſiderations will ſhow us the propriety, and expediency, of that practice which hath obtained, ever ſince the apoſtles days, to the preſent time; the practice of charging thoſe who are inducted into the ſacred office, and about to enter upon the work of the goſpel miniſtry; to take heed, and fulfil the miniſtry they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Lord.</p>
            <p>The apoſtles charged thoſe whom they ordained paſtors of churches; charged them before God, and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the elect angels, to take heed to themſelves, and to all the flock, over which the holy ghoſt had made them biſhops.</p>
            <p>And as we the elders of thoſe churches, which being invited, are here preſent by their delegates; have been witneſſes of the ſolemn tranſaction which hath now taken place, and aſſiſted therein: it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes us, to remind ourſelves and one another, of the obligations we are under, by our ordination vows, to be faithful to God, and to thoſe precious immortals, committed to our keeping.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:028618_0028_0FD9C731C7649BD0"/>Particularly, in humble imitation of the inſpired apoſtles, who were the firſt miniſters of Chriſt, it behoves us to charge this our brother, and fellow labourer in Chriſt's vineyard; who has to day, publicly dedicated himſelf to the ſervice of God; in the goſpel of his Son; and by prayer and the lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of our hands, been ordained and conſtituted Biſhop of this church of God in New-Hartford: it is incumbent on us, to charge him faithfully to do the work of an evangeliſt, and fulfil every part of that miniſtry he has received of the Lord.<note n="*" place="bottom">Hitherto the ſpeaker had addreſſed himſelf to the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at large: he now turned and addreſſed himſelf particularly to the newly ordained elder.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We do therefore, before God who made the world, and before the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the world in righteouſneſs, at his ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing, and before the elect angels, many of whom have, (probably) been ſpectators of the ſolemn tranſactions of this day, and will be witneſſes to all your miniſterial conduct in future life—before theſe, we charge thee, EDWARD DORR GRIFFIN, moſt carefully to keep, and faithfully to uſe, that which is now committed to thy truſt. Take heed unto thyſelf; take heed unto thy doctrine, and take heed to all this flock of God over which the holy ghoſt hath made you overſeer.</p>
            <p>Many ſouls are committed to your paſtoral care. See what a multitude are waiting for you to ſhow them the way of ſalvation, and lead them to realms of unfading bliſs! You watch for ſouls; and if one of theſe is loſt through your ignorance, careleſſneſs or inattention; the blood of that ſoul will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at your hands: and what can you give in
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:028618_0029_0FD9C732ED40A010"/>
exchange for it? Be thou therefore, a wiſe and faithful ſteward; and give to every one his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of meat in due ſeaſon. Feed the ſheep, and feed the lambs of this flock of God, with the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere milk of the word, and with ſtrong meat, as they are able to bear; taking the overſight of them, not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind, and not as being a lord over God's heritage; but as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of believers, in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity.</p>
            <p>In the bible you will find the duty of a chriſtian miniſter, clearly pointed out: therefore, thou man of God! acquaint thyſelf more and more, with theſe lively oracles; give attendance to reading; ſearch the ſcriptures daily; ſtudy the duties of your office; and give yourſelf to prayer for an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding heart, that you may know what the mind of the ſpirit is, and what the Lord would have you do: meditate upon theſe things; give thyſelf whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to them, that thy profiting may appear unto all.</p>
            <p>He that deſireth the office of a Biſhop, deſireth a good work: But a Biſhop muſt be blameleſs as the ſteward of God; not ſelf-willed; not ſoon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry; not given to wine; no ſtriker; not given to filthy lucre; not contentious, not covetous; but given to hoſpitality; a lover of good men; patient, ſober, juſt, holy, temperate, vigilant, of good be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour in all reſpects, and of good report among all men: apt to teach; and able by ſound doctrine, both to exhort, and to convince gainſayers.</p>
            <p>Take heed therefore unto thyſelf—to thy life and converſation. Flee every fooliſh and hurtful luſt, and avoid profane and fooliſh talking, and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:028618_0030_0FD9C73434915DF0"/>
ſuch jeſting as is not convenient; yea, carefully ſhun every thing which may reflect blame on the miniſtry, or give occaſion for any to deſpiſe thee. Show thyſelf a pattern of good works; and let your converſation at all times be as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the goſpel of Chriſt. Follow righteouſneſs, godlineſs, faith, love, patience and meekneſs; let your light ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works; conſtantly practice whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever things are true, whatſoever things are honeſt, whatſoever things are pure, whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report, and whatſoever is virtuous, and worthy praiſe. Keep your body under, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt by any means, when you have preached to others, you yourſelf, ſhould be caſt away.</p>
            <p>Take heed alſo unto thy doctrine, and in your preaching ſhow uncorruptneſs, gravity, ſincerity and ſound ſpeech which cannot be condemned. Renounce the hidden things of diſhoneſty; walk not in craftineſs, nor handle the word of God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfully, but by manifeſtation of the truth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend yourſelf to every man's conſcience in the ſight of God. Take heed what you preach. Be not aſhamed of the goſpel of Chriſt, but preach the peculiar and diſtinguiſhing doctrines of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity—preach the unſearchable riches of a crucified and riſen Saviour—preach the divinity, the huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and the atonement of Chriſt, and point ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to him, as the Lamb of God, which taketh away the ſins of the world. Preach alſo the apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the human race, and wickedneſs of the human heart—the neceſſity of regeneration, and ſovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of divine grace: Shun not to delcare the whole counſel of God: but preach the truth, the whole
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:028618_0031_0FD9C738E63A02C0"/>
truth and nothing but the truth. A diſpenſation of the goſpel is committed unto thee; and wo unto thee, EDWARD DORR, if thou preach not the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, take heed how you preach; and ſhow yourſelf a workman, who needeth not to be aſhamed, rightly dividing the word of truth, and chooſing out the moſt acceptable words in which to convey truth, to the hearts and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of your hearers. Be wiſe to win ſouls, and eſpouſe them to Chriſt. Preach like a dying man, to dying men. Be fervent in ſpirit—the cauſe is good, be zealous in it; and both by the terrors of the Lord, and the extreme ſufferings of an incarnate God, beſeech ſinners to become re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to God. Point out to them their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and open to them the way of ſafety, and urge them to eſcape for their lives. Be inſtant, in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and out of ſeaſon: reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-ſuffering and doctrine: teaching pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly and from houſe to houſe, repentance towards God and faith towards our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Warn them that are unruly, comfort the feeble minded; and be gentle unto all men; in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs inſtructing thoſe that oppoſe themſelves. Let your preaching be, not with enticing words of man's wiſdom, as if you ſpake in an unknown tongue; but in a plain, familiar ſtile, eaſy to be underſtood; that ſo the ignorant and unlearned, may be inſtructed and edified: and ceaſe not to warn every one night and day with tears, warn the wicked of their tranſgreſſions and ſins, warn them to flee from wrath to come. By thus taking heed unto thyſelf, and to thy doctrine, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing in them, thou ſhalt both ſave thyſelf, and them that hear thee.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:028618_0032_0FD9C73B9DA4F188"/>Again, pray with and for this people:—bear them on your heart continually; and, without ceaſing, make mention of them always in your prayers. You will alſo from time to time, bleſs this people in the name of the Lord. And that you may know their ſtate, and be able to adapt your labors to their particular circumſtances, it will be neceſſary for you to viſit them, as you have opportunity, as well in health as in ſickneſs, and both in proſperity and in adverſity; and, as pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhall direct, converſe with them about their temporal, and about their ſpiritual concerns.</p>
            <p>Moreover, we charge thee to adminiſter the ſeals of the new Teſtament, Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper; but to ſuch, and to none but ſuch, as are duly qualified, according to the laws of Chriſt's viſible kingdom. Attentively obſerve all things whatſoever he hath commanded; and neither add to, nor diminiſh from his written word; but taking that for your guide, carefully diſtinguiſh between the unclean, and the clean; and put a difference between the holy and profane. Beware you do not give that which is holy unto dogs; neither offend the generation of God's children, for whom Chriſt died.</p>
            <p>We charge thee alſo to exerciſe goſpel diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, according to the authority Chriſt hath given his miniſters, as officers in his kingdom; which authority is given them, not for the deſtruction, but for the edification of the members of his body, the church. Therefore, reprove, rebuke, admon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, and reject as occaſion ſhall require. But do nothing by partiality; and yet, of ſome have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:028618_0033_0FD9C73D085FA570"/>
making a difference; others ſave with fear, pulling them out of the fire.</p>
            <p>Finally, The miniſterial office, which, in all its parts, is now committed to thee; the ſame do thou alſo commit to faithful men. And that you may not partake of other men's ſins, but keep thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pure; lay hands ſuddenly on no man, nor be inſtrumental of introducing any into the goſpel miniſtry, but ſuch as are of good report, ſound in the faith with reſpect to the eſſential doctrines of chriſtianity, and in a judgment of charity real friends to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>We give thee charge, brother, as we ourſelves have been charged, in the ſight of God, who quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth all things, and before Jeſus Chriſt, who in the preſence of Pontius Pilate witneſſed a good confeſſion—before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, we charge thee, to keep that which is committed to thy truſt. You are now a miniſter of Chriſt, and ſteward of the myſteries of God: and every motive which ought to influence a rational mind, allures, and conſtrains you to be a good miniſter and faithful ſteward. They that be wiſe, ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament; and they that turn many to righteouſneſs, as the ſtars for ever and ever. And he which converteth a ſinner from the error of his way, ſhall ſave a ſoul from death, and ſhall hide a multitude of ſins. What encouraging proſpects! What animating conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, for the meſſengers of the Lord of Hoſts, the ambaſſadors for Chriſt! Be thou a faithful laborer in your Lord and maſter's vineyard; and when the chief ſhepherd ſhall appear, you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a crown of glory that fadeth not away. To
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:028618_0034_0FD9C74094FF7530"/>
him who is able to keep you from falling, we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you; and to the word of his grace we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the dear people of your charge: may they be your rejoicing, and you theirs, in the day of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And to the only wiſe GOD our SAVIOUR, be GLORY and MAJESTY, DOMINION and POWER, both now, and ever; AMEN.</p>
