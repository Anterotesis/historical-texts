            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE REMARKABLE ADVENTURES OF JACKSON JOHONNET.</head>
            <p>THERE is ſeldom a more difficult taſk under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by man, than the act of writing a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a perſon's own life; eſpecially where the inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents border on the marvellous. Prodigies but ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happen, and the veracity of relaters of them is ſtill leſs frequently vouched for; however, as the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of Providence towards me have been too ſtriking not to make a deep and grateful impreſſion, and as the principal part of them can be atteſted to by living evidences, I ſhall proceed, being confident that the candid reader will pardon the inaccuracies of an illiterate ſoldier, and that the tender hearted will drop the tear of ſympathy, when they realize the idea of the ſufferings of ſuch of our unfortunate country folks as fall into the hands of the weſtern Indians, whoſe tender mercies are cruelties.</p>
            <p>I was born and brought up at Falmouth, Caſcobay, where I reſided until I attained to the ſeventeenth year of my age. My parents were poor, the farm we oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied ſmall and hard to cultivate, their family large and expenſive, and every way fitted to ſpare me to ſeek a ſeparate fortune; at leaſt theſe ideas had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo great an aſcendancy in my mind that I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, with the conſent of my parents, to look out for means of ſupporting myſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:025665_0003_0FCEBB777926C0A8"/>Having fixed on the matter firmly, I took leave of my friends and ſailed on the 1ſt of May, 1791, on board a coaſting ſchooner for Boſton. Being arrived in this capital, and entirely out of employ, I had many uneaſy ſenſations, and more than once ſincerely wiſhed myſelf at home with my parents; however, as I had ſet out on an important deſign, and as yet met with no misfortune, pride kept me from this act, while neceſſity urged me to fix ſpeedily on ſome mode of obtaining a livelihood.</p>
            <p>My mind was ſeverely agitated on this ſubject one morning, when a young officer came into my room, and ſoon entered into converſation on the pleaſures of a military life, the great chance there was for an active young man to obtain promotion, and the grand proſpect opening for making great fortunes in the weſtern country. His artifice had the deſired effect; for after treating me with a bowl or two of punch, I enliſted, with a firm promiſe on his ſide to aſſiſt me in obtaining a ſerjeant's warrant before the party left Boſton.</p>
            <p>An entire new ſcene now opened before me; inſtead becoming a ſerjeant, I was treated ſeverely for my ignorance in a matter I had until then ſcarcely thought it, and inſultingly ridiculed for remonſtrating againſt the conduct of the officer. I ſuffered great uneaſineſs on theſe and other accounts of a ſimilar kind, for ſome time; at length, convinced of the futility of complaint, I applied myſelf to ſtudy the exerciſe, and in a few days became tolerably expert. The begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of July we left Boſton, and proceeded on our way to join the weſtern army. When we arrived at Fort Waſhington I was ordered to join Capt. Phelon's company, and in a few days ſet out on the expedition under General Harmar. Thoſe alone who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced, can tell what hardſhips men undergo in ſuch excurſions; hunger, fatigue and toil were our
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:025665_0004_0FCEBB7AC7E40500"/>
conſtant attendants; however, as our expectations were raiſed with the idea of eaſy conqueſt, rich plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and fine farms in the end, we made a ſhift to be tolerably merry: For my own part, I had obtained a ſerjeancy, and flattered myſelf I was in the direct road to honour, fame and fortune. Alas! how fluctuating are the ſcenes of life! how ſingularly precarious the fortune of a ſoldier! before a ſingle opportunity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in which I could have a chance to ſignalize myſelf, it was my lot to be taken in an ambuſcade, by a party of Kickapoo Indians, and with ten others conſtrained to experience ſcenes, in compariſon of which our former diſtreſſes ſunk into nothing. We were taken on the banks of the Wabaſh, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately conveyed to the upper Miami, at lead ſuch of us as ſurvived. The ſecond day after we were taken, one of my companions, by the name of George Ai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, a native of Ireland, became ſo faint with hunger and fatigue that he could proceed no further; a ſhort council was immediately held among the Indians who guarded us, the reſult of which was that he ſhould be put to death: This was no ſooner determined on, than a ſcene of horror began: The captain of the guard approached the victim, who lay bound upon the ground, and with his knife made a circular inciſion on the ſkull; two others immediately pulled off the ſcalp; after this they each of them ſtruck him on the head with their tomahawks; they then ſtripped him naked, ſtabbed him with their knives in every ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive part of the body, and left him weltering in blood, though not quite dead, a wretched victim to Indian rage and helliſh barbarity.</p>
            <p>We were eight days on our march to the upper Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ami, during which painful travel, no pen can deſcribe our ſufferings from hunger, thirſt, and toil. We were met at the entrance of the town by above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Indians, beſides ſquaws and children, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025665_0005_0FCEBB7BF38EB718"/>
by a moſt hideous yelling made by our guard, and anſwered repeatedly from the village.— Here we were all ſeverely beaten by the Indians, and four of our number, viz. James Durgee, of Concord, Samuel Forſythe, of Beverly, Robert Deloy, of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blehead, and Uzza Benton, of Salem, who all faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under their heavy trials, were ſcalped and toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawked in our preſence, and tortured to death with every inflicted miſery that Indian ingenuity could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent.</p>
            <p>It was the 4th of Auguſt when we were taken, and our unhappy companions were maſſacred the 13th. News was that day received of the deſtruction of L'Anguille, &amp;c. by General Harmar, numbers of ſcalps were exhibited by the warriors, and ſeveral priſoners, among whom were three women and ſix children, carried through the village, deſtined to a Kickapoo ſettlement further weſtward. The fifteenth of Auguſt four more of my fellow priſoners, viz. Lemuel Saunders, of Boſton, Thomas Thap, of Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter, Vincent Upham, of Miſtic, and Younglove Croxall, of Abington, were taken from us, but wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they were maſſacred or preſerved alive, I am una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſay. After this nothing material occurred for a fortnight, except that we were ſeveral times ſeverely whipped on the receipt of bad news, and our allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of proviſions leſſened, ſo that we did not fall an immediate ſacrifice to the fire or tomahawk, but Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en had otherwiſe decreed.</p>
            <p>On the night following the 30th of Auguſt, our guard, which conſiſted of four Indians, tired out with watching, laid down to ſleep, leaving only an old ſquaw to attend to us; Providence ſo ordered that my companion had by ſome means got one of his hands at liberty, and having a knife in his pocket, ſoon cut the withes that bound his feet, and that which pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioned my arms, unperceived of the old ſquaw, who
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025665_0006_0FCEBB7D6C31D3D8"/>
ſat in a drowſy poſition, not ſuſpecting harm, over a ſmall fire in the wigwam.</p>
            <p>I ruminated but a few moments on our ſituation; there was no weapon near us, except my companion's knife, which he ſtill held; I looked on him to make him obſerve me, and the ſame inſtant ſprang and graſped the ſquaw by the throat to prevent her making a noiſe, and my comrade in a moment diſpatched her for the world of ſpirits. He then ſeized a tomahawk, and myſelf a rifle, and ſtriking at the ſame inſtant, diſpatched two of our enemies; the ſound of theſe blows awakened the others, but before they had time to riſe, we renewed our ſtrokes on them, and luckily to ſo good effect as to ſtun them, and then repeating the blow we ſunk a tomahawk in each of their heads, armed ourſelves completely, and taking what provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions the wigwam afforded, we committed ourſelves to the protection of Providence, and made the beſt of our way into the wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>The compaſs of a volume would ſcarce contain the events of our progreſs through the wilderneſs, but as they were intereſting to none but us, I ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve generally, that the difficulties of the journey were too great to have been endured by any who had leſs intereſt than life at ſtake, or a leſs terrible enemy than Indians to fear. Hunger, thirſt and fatigue were our conſtant companions, and of a truth we could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that weariſome nights were appointed unto us: We travelled hard day and night, except the few hours abſolutely requiſite for repoſe, that nature might not ſink under her oppreſſion, at which period one conſtantly watched while the other ſlept. In this tireſome mode we proceeded until the 15th of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, having often to ſhift our direction on account of impaſſable bogs, deep moraſſes and hideous precipices, without meeting any adventure worthy note. On the morning of the 15th, as we were ſteering nearly a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025665_0007_0FCEBB7F0530EB20"/>
north courſe in order to avoid a bog that intercepted our courſe S. E. we found the bodies of one old man, a woman and two children newly murdered, ſtript and ſcalped. This horrid ſpectacle chilled our blood; we viewed the wretched victims, and from what we could collect from circumſtances, we concluded that they had been dragged away from their homes, and their feet being worn out, had been murdered inhumanly and left weltering in their blood. We were at a great loſs now to determine what courſe to ſteer; at length we pitched on a direction about northweſt, and walked on as faſt as poſſible to eſcape the ſavages, if practicable. About noon this day we came to a good ſpring, which was a great relief to us, but which we had great reaſon, a few minutes after, to believe would be the laſt of our earthly comforts. My companion, Richard Sackville, a corporal of Capt. Newman's company, ſtepped aſide into a thicket on ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and returned with the account that a few rods diſtant he had diſcovered four Indians with two miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable wretches bound, ſitting under a tree, eating; and that if I would join him, he would either relieve the captives or periſh in the attempt: The reſolution of my worthy comrade pleaſed me greatly; and as no time was to be loſt, we ſat immediately about the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of our deſign: Sackville took the lead, and conducted me, undiſcovered, within fifty yards of the Indians. Two of them were laid down, with their muſkets in their arms, and appeared to be aſleep; the others ſat at the head of the priſoners, their muſkets reſting againſt their left ſhoulders, and in their right hands each of them a tomahawk, over the head of their priſoners: We each choſe our man to fire at, and, taking aim deliberately, had the ſatisfaction to ſee them both fall; the others inſtantly ſtarted, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at a loſs to determine from whence the aſſault was made, fell on their bellies, and looked carefully around,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:025665_0008_0FCEBB806B1E1DD0"/>
to diſcover the beſt courſe to take; meantime we had re-charged, and ſhifting our poſition a little, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently waited their riſing; in a minute they raiſed on their hands and knees, and having, as we ſuppoſed, diſcovered the ſmoke of our guns riſing above the buſhes, attempted to crawl into the thicket on the oppoſite ſide. This gave us a good chance, and we again fired, at different men, and with ſuch effect that we brought them both down; one lay motionleſs, the other crawled along a few yards; we loaded in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and ruſhed towards him, yet keeping an eye on him, as he had reached his comrade's gun, and ſat up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in a poſture of defence. By our noiſe in the buſhes he diſcovered the direction to fire; alas! too fatally, for by his fatal ſhot I loſt my faithful comrade and friend Sackville. At this moment the two priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, who were cloſe pinioned, endeavoured to make their eſcape towards me, but the deſperate ſavage again fired, and ſhot one of them dead; the other gained the thicket within a few yards of me: I had now once more got ready to fire, and diſcharged at the wounded Indian; at this diſcharge I wounded him in the neck, from whence I perceived the blood to flow ſwiftly, but he yet undauntedly kept his ſeat, and having new charged his guns, fired upon us with them both, and then fell, ſeemingly from faintneſs and loſs of blood. I ran inſtantly to the pinioned white man, and having unbound his arms, and armed him with the unfortunate Sackville's muſket, we cautiouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached a few yards nearer the wounded Indian, when I ordered my new comrade to fire, and we could per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the ſhot took effect, yet the ſavage lay motion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. As ſoon as my companion had re-loaded, we approached the Indian, whom we found not quite dead, and a tomahawk in each hand, which he flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed at us, ſeemingly determined not to be taken alive. I felt for my own part determined to take him

alive, if poſſible, but my new comrade prevented me by ſhooting him through the body. I now inquired of my new companion what courſe we ought to ſteer, and whence the party came, from whoſe power I had relieved him; he informed me with reſpect to the courſe, which we immediately took, and on the way let me know that we were within about three days march of Fort Jefferſon; that he and three others were taken by a party of ten Wabaſh Indians four days before, in the neighbourhood of that fort; that two of his companions, being wounded, were immediately ſcalped and killed; that the party, at the time of taking him, had in their poſſeſſion ſeven other priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, three of whom were committed to the charge of a party of four Indians; what became of them he knew not; the others being worn down with fatigue, were maſſacred the day before, and which I found to be thoſe whoſe bodies poor Sackville diſcovered in the thicket; that the other two Indians were gone to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſettlements, having ſworn to kill certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe names he had forgotten, and that deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſeemed to be their whole drift.</p>
            <p>My comrade, whoſe name on inquiry I found to be Gregory Sexton, formerly a reſident of Newport, Rhode-Iſland, I found to be an excellent woodſman, and a man of great ſpirit, and ſo grateful for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance I had been inſtrumental in obtaining for him, that he would not ſuffer me to watch for him to ſleep, but one hour in the four and twenty, although he was ſo fatigued as to have abſolute need of a much greater proportion; neither would he permit me to carry any of our baggage.</p>
            <p>From the time of being joined by Sexton, we ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a S. E. courſe, as direct as poſſible, until the 18th towards night, directing our courſe by the ſun and the moſs on the trees by day, and the moon by night; on the evening of the 18th, we providentially fell in

with an American ſcouting party, who conducted us ſafely, in a few hours, to Fort Jefferſon, where we were treated with great humanity, and ſupplied with the beſt refreſhments the fort afforded, which to me was very acceptable, as I had not taſted any thing, except wild berries and ground nuts, for above a week.</p>
            <p>This fort is ſituated in a fertile country, within a few miles of the ſpot where Braddock's defeat took place. I walked over the ground where the action happened, a few days after our arrival at Fort Jeffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and viewed it very attentively; having a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion with me who was able to deſcribe the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent poſitions of the Engliſh army on that very unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py day. In many places we obſerved human bones ſtrewed on the ground, which remained unconſumed, and excited melancholy ſenſations. Many of the trees around ſtill ſhew the ſcars of balls which grazed them in the action. Alas! how little did I think at the time of viewing theſe things, that an army of Americans, nearly equal in number to general Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dock's, was deſtined in a few days to experience a ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar defeat, and fly acroſs this melancholy ſpot: This however was the caſe, and myſelf, ſo often in danger, and ſo repeatedly the ſubject of ſignal deliverances, was by deſtiny to be an actor in the tremendous ſcene; and once more, almoſt miraculouſly, to eſcape alive, while death, in its moſt dreadful ſhape, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every direction, and ſeemed to be inſatiable in his deſire of victims.</p>
            <p>The week after our arrival at Fort Jefferſon, I was able to return to my own regiment, which, the latter end of October, joined the weſtern army, on an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition againſt the Indians of the Miami Village, the place in which I had ſuffered ſo much, and ſo recently, and where I had beheld ſo many cruelties perpetrated on the unfortunate Americans. It is eaſier to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive than deſcribe the perturbation of my mind <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

this occaſion—the riſk I ſhould run, in common with my fellow ſoldiers, ſeemed heightened by the certainty of torture that awaited me in caſe of being captured by the ſavages. However, theſe reflections only oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned a firm reſolution of doing my duty vigilantly, and ſelling my life in action as dear as poſſible, but by no means to be taken alive, if I could evade it by any exertion ſhort of ſuicide.</p>
            <p>My captain ſhewed me every kindneſs in his power on the march, indulged me with a horſe as often as poſſible, and promiſed to uſe his influence to obtain a commiſſion for me, if I conducted well the preſent expedition;—poor gentleman! little did he think he was ſoon to expire, gallantly fighting the battles of his country! I haſten now to the moſt intereſting part of my ſhort narrative, the deſcription of Gen. St. Clair's defeat, and the ſcenes which ſucceeded it.</p>
            <p>On the 3d of November we arrived within a few miles of the Miami Village. Our army conſiſted of about 1200 regular troops, and nearly an equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of militia. The night of the 3d, having reaſon to expect an attack, we were ordered under arms about midnight, and kept in order until juſt before day light; at which time, ſcouts having been ſent out in various directions, and no enemy diſcovered, we were diſmiſſed from the parade to take ſome refreſhment. The men in general, almoſt worn out with fatigue, had thrown themſelves down to repoſe a little: But their reſt was of ſhort duration, for before ſunriſe the Indians began a tremendous attack upon the militia, ſoon threw them into diſorder, and forced them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire before them precipitately, into the very heart of our camp.</p>
            <p>But alas! what were my feelings, when ſtarting from my ſlumbers, I heard the moſt tremendous fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all around, with yellings, horrid whoopings, and expiring groans in dreadful diſcord ſounding in mine
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025665_0012_0FCEBB8AFB06D318"/>
ears. I ſeized my arms, ran out of my tent with ſeveral of my comrades, and ſaw the Indians with their bloody tomahawks and murderous knives butchering the flying militia. I flew towards them, filled with deſperation, diſcharged my firelock among them, and had the ſatisfaction to ſee one of the tawny ſavages fall, whoſe tomahawk was at that inſtant elevated to ſtrike a gallant officer, who was then engaged ſword in hand with a ſavage in front. My example, I have reaſon to think, animated my companions. Our own compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny now reached the place we occupied, and aided by the regulars of other companies and regiments, who joined us indiſcriminately, we drove the Indians back into the buſh, and ſoon after formed in tolerable order, under as gallant commanders as ever died in defence of America. The firing ceaſed for a few minutes, but it was like the interval of a tornado, calculated, by an inſtantaneous, dreadful reverſe, to ſtrike the deeper horror. In one and the ſame minute, ſeemingly, the moſt deadly and heavy firing took place in every part of our camp; the army, expoſed to the ſhot of the enemy, delivered from the ground, fell on every ſide, and drenched the plains in blood, while the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from our troops, directed almoſt at random, I am fearful did but little execution. Orders were now given to charge with bayonets, we obeyed with alac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; a dreadful ſwarm of tawny ſavages roſe from the ground and fled before us; but alas! our officers, rendered conſpicuous by their exertions to ſtimulate the men, become victims to ſavage ingenuity, and fell ſo faſt, in common with the reſt, that ſcarce a ſhot ſpent in vain.—Advantages gained by the bayonet were, by this means, and want of due ſupport, loſt again, and our little corps obliged, in turn, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly to give way before the Indians.—We were now reduced to leſs than half our original number of regular troops, and leſs than a fourth part of our officers, our
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025665_0013_0FCEBB8C6EE4EDB8"/>
horſes all killed or taken, our artillery men all cut off, and the pieces in the enemy's hands; in this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dilemma we had nothing to do but to attempt a retreat, which ſoon became a flight, and for ſeveral miles, amidſt the yells of Indians, more dreadful to my ears than ſcreams of hateful fiends to my ideas, amidſt the groans of dying men, and the dreadful ſight of bloody maſſacres on every ſide, perpetrated by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians on the unfortunate creatures they overtook, I endured a degree of torture no tongue can deſcribe, or heart conceive; yet, I providentially eſcaped un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hurt, and frequently diſcharged my muſket, as I am perſuaded, to effect.</p>
            <p>Providence was pleaſed to ſuſtain my ſpirits and preſerve my ſtrength, and although I had been ſo far ſpent previous to ſetting out on the expedition, as to be unable to go upon fatigue for ſeveral days, or even to bear a moderate degree of exerciſe, I reached Fort Jefferſon the day after the action, about ten in the morning, having travelled on foot all night to effect it.</p>
            <p>Thus have I made the reader acquainted with the moſt intereſting ſcenes of my life; many of them are extraordinary, ſome of them perhaps incredible, but all of them founded in fact, which can be atteſted by numbers. Gen. St. Clair, in conſequence of my ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and what he and others were pleaſed to call ſoldier-like exertions, preſented me with an enſign's commiſſion, on joining the remains of my old compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in which ſtation I mean to ſerve my country again, as far as my ſlender abilities will permit; truſting that the ſame kind, protecting Providence, which hath covered my head in the day of battle, and ſhielded me repeatedly in the hour of danger, will diſpoſe of me as to infinite wiſdom ſeems beſt; and if I die in the cauſe of my country, may the remembrance of my ſufferings, eſcapes, perſeverance through divine ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and repeated mercies received, kindle a flame of
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:025665_0014_0FCEBB8E327C7FE0"/>
heroiſm in the breaſt of many an American youth, and induce him, while he reads the ſufferings of his unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate countrymen, to exert himſelf to defend the worthy inhabitants on the frontiers from the depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſavages; whoſe horrid mode of war is a ſcene to be deprecated by civilized nature, whoſe ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der mercies are cruelties, and whoſe faith is by no means to be depended on, though pledged in the moſt ſolemn treaties. The reader will permit me to cloſe a ſhort, but to me an extremely intereſting narrative, with a few lines compoſed, as a ſong, by my worthy comrade Sackville, a few days before his death, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hour to watch while I ſlept.</p>
