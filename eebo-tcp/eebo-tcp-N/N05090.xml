            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE Title of this Treatise shows, there was a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of the same Nature; and the Author hopes he runs no Hazard in Recommending Both to his Reader's Perusal. He is well aware of the</hi> low <hi>Reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning the Labours of</hi> Indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb facs="unknown:006393_0003_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>Authors are under, at a Time when hardly any Thing passes for Currant, that is not Calculated to</hi> Flatter <hi>the Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of Contending Parties. He is also sensible, that Books grow a very</hi> Drug, <hi>where they cannot Raise and Support their Credit, by their own Useful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and how far this will be able to do it, he knows not; yet he thinks himself tolerably safe in making it Publick, in three Respects.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>First, <hi>That the</hi> Purchase <hi>is</hi> small, <hi>and the Time but</hi> little, <hi>that is requisite to read It.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Lastly, <hi>The Author honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aims at as General a Benefit as the Thing will bear; to</hi> YOUTH <hi>especially, whether he hits the Mark or not: And that without the least Osten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, or any private Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards.</hi>
            </p>

               <head>The RIGHT MORALIST.</head>
               <p n="1">1. A Right Moralist, is a Great and Good Man, but for that Reason he is <hi>rarely</hi> to be found.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="2" facs="unknown:006393_0007_0000000000000000"/>2. There are a sort of People, that are <hi>fond</hi> of the Character, who, in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, have but little Title to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They think it enough, not to <hi>defraud</hi> a Man of his Pay, or <hi>betray</hi> his Friend; but never consider, That the Law forbids the one at his Peril, and that Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is <hi>seldom</hi> the Reason of the other.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But certainly he that <hi>Covets,</hi> can no more be a Moral Man, than he that <hi>Steals;</hi> since he does so in his Mind. Nor can he be one that Robs his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his <hi>Credit,</hi> or that 
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:006393_0008_0000000000000000"/>
craftily undermines him of his <hi>Trade</hi> or <hi>Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. If a Man pays his Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, but Debauches his Wife; Is he a currant Moralist?</p>
               <p n="6">6. But what shall we say of the Man that <hi>Rebels</hi> against his Father, is an <hi>ill Husband,</hi> or an <hi>Abusive Neighbour;</hi> one that's <hi>Lavish</hi> of his Time; of his Health, and of his Estate, in which his Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is so nearly concerned? Must he go for a Right Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralist, because he pays his Rent well?</p>
               <p n="7">7. I would ask some of those Men of Morals, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he that Robs <hi>God</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006393_0009_0000000000000000"/>
                  <hi>Himself</hi> too, though he should not defraud his Neighbour, be the Moral Man?</p>
               <p n="8">8. Do I owe myself No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? And do I not owe All to God? And if pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what we owe makes the Moral Man, Is it not sit we should begin to render our Dues, <hi>where</hi> we owe our very Beginning; ay, our <hi>All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9. The <hi>Compleat</hi> Moralist begins with <hi>God;</hi> he gives him his Due, his <hi>Heart,</hi> his <hi>Love,</hi> his <hi>Service;</hi> the Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Giver of his <hi>Well-Being,</hi> as well as Being.</p>
               <p n="10">10. He that lives with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Sense of this Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency 
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006393_0010_0000000000000000"/>
and Obligation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a Moral Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he does not make his Returns of Love and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, as becomes an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and a sensible Creature: Which very Term implies he is not his own; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be very honest to mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imploy another's Goods.</p>
               <p n="11">11. But can there be no Debt, but to a fellow Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Or, will our Exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness in paying those <hi>

                  </hi> once, while we neglect our weightier Obligations, Cancel the Bonds we lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and render us right and thorough Moralists?</p>
               <p n="12">
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:006393_0011_0000000000000000"/>12. As <hi>Judgments</hi> are paid before <hi>Bonds,</hi> and <hi>Bonds</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Bills</hi> or <hi>Book-Debts,</hi> so the Moralist considers his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations according to their several <hi>Dignities.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the first Place, <hi>Him</hi> to whom he owes himself. Next <hi>himself,</hi> in his Health and Livelihood. Lastly, His o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Obligations, whether <hi>Rational</hi> or <hi>Pecuniary;</hi> doing to others, to the Extents of his Ability, as he would have them do unto him.</p>
               <p n="13">13. In short, The <hi>Moral Man</hi> is he that <hi>Loves God above All, and his Neighbour as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,</hi> which fulfils both Tables at once.</p>

               <p n="296">296. Wherefore a Man can never be a true and good Christian without Charity, even in the lowest Sense of

it: And yet he may have that Part thereof, and still be none of the Apostle's <hi>true Christian,</hi> since he tells us, That tho' we should give all our Goods to the Poor, and <hi>want Charity</hi> (in her other and higher Senses) <hi>it would profit us nothing.</hi>
