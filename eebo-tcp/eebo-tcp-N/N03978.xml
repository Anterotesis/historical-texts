            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER To the REVEREND Mr. <hi>James Davenport, Paſtor</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of CHRIST, in SOUTH-HOLD, on LONG-ISLAND, now in BOSTON.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Reverend Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOUR coming to BOSTON, under the influence of <hi>impulſes</hi> and <hi>impreſſions,</hi> taking them for a <hi>call</hi> from GOD; and your manner of conduct ſince you have been in town, (conformable in ſome meaſure to what it has been in other places) was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of my ſtudying, and preaching, and afterwards giving way to the publication of the following <hi>Sermon:</hi> And, as I think, there is that in it, which may be a <hi>word in ſeaſon</hi> to a gentleman of your caſt of mind, I herewith make a preſent of it to you; and ſhall be glad, if it may be of ſervice to you, as I hope it will to others, guarding them againſt the wilds of a heated imagination.</p>
            <p>When you came to my houſe, ſome days ago, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the <hi>reaſon of the hope that was in me,</hi> my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention was, to deal plainly and faithfully with you:
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:004912_0004_100E192A0BAAF040"/>
And I believe, you do not think, I was wanting upon that head. Whether you heard what I then ſaid with <hi>pity towards me,</hi> or becoming <hi>reflections on your ſelf,</hi> I know not: Time may diſcover which. But whatever the working of your mind was, I am abundantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd in it, that your <hi>real</hi> character was fairly laid open before you.</p>
            <p>I doubt not, you verily think, GOD ſent you hither; and that your preaching here is by <hi>immediate</hi> commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from <hi>him</hi>: But others muſt be excus'd, if they han't the ſame tho't of the matter. They are in the opinion, <hi>your own ſtock</hi> is <hi>your proper charge</hi>; and can't eaſily be bro't to believe, that GOD would <hi>call</hi> you to leave them, without making way for their ſupply in the mean time. This, you may think, <hi>he</hi> has done: But others are of a different mind; thoſe, to be ſure, are ſo, who know what a <hi>weak, raw, illiterate, young man,</hi> you have ſent to them; one, who lived in theſe parts, and gave ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient proof of his <hi>ignorance,</hi> and <hi>raſhneſs,</hi> and <hi>unskillfull<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> as well as other things, I ſhan't here mention.</p>
            <p>But that, more eſpecially, which ſatiſfies me, as well as many others, that you are miſled in the tho't of being ſent by GOD, in an <hi>extraordinary</hi> manner, to this place, is, the <hi>miſchief</hi> you are like to do here. What good you may have been the means of elſewhere; I know not: But I am well aſſured, inſtead of <hi>good,</hi> you will be the <hi>occaſion</hi> of much <hi>hurt,</hi> to the intereſt of religion in theſe churches. Your <hi>manner</hi> in ſpeaking, as well as <hi>what you ſay,</hi> ſeems rather calculated, at leaſt at ſome times, to diſturb the <hi>imagination,</hi> than inform the <hi>judgment</hi>: And I am fully perſwaded, you too often miſtake the <hi>mechanical</hi> operations of <hi>violent voice</hi> and <hi>action,</hi> for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of another kind. Some are not without fear, leaſt by your imprudencies, you ſhould do much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bringing <hi>converſion,</hi> the very <hi>name</hi> of it, into contempt. 'Tis certain, many good people are offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and thoſe, who have no ſerious concern about re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, are in danger of throwing it off, as a wild, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly, imaginary buſineſs. And if, by your extravagant conduct, you ſhould excite ſuch prejudices in the minds of people againſt chriſtianity, as ſhould unhappily prove
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:004912_0005_100E1958EB72B610"/>
the <hi>occaſion</hi> of their ruin, would it not afford juſt ground of the moſt ſevere reflections on your ſelf?</p>
            <p>The preaching of CHRIST <hi>crucified,</hi> may be, 'tis true, <hi>a ſtumbling-block</hi> to ſome, and <hi>fooliſhneſs</hi> to others; and the <hi>preachers,</hi> at the ſame time, <hi>a ſweet ſavour to</hi> GOD, even <hi>in them that periſh.</hi> But how will this juſtify <hi>real weakneſſes,</hi> and <hi>juſt occaſions of offence?</hi> If, under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>preaching</hi> CHRIST, men will run into open im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudencies, and ſet religion in ſuch an <hi>ugly light</hi> by their <hi>unguarded conduct,</hi> as eventually iſſues in great damage to men's <hi>ſouls,</hi> they are certainly chargeable with it; and to a greater degree of guilt, than they may be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently aware of. <hi>Enthuſiaſtic wildneſs has ſlain its thouſands.</hi> This, Sir, deſerves your moſt ſerious conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. And while you are ſo ready to faſten on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers the guilt of the <hi>blood of ſouls,</hi> it would not be amiſs, if you were a little more critical in examining, how far you may, <hi>your ſelf,</hi> be guilty in the like kind. This is a momentous affair. And <hi>ſelf-deceit</hi> will be no more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable in you, than in others. <hi>Be not high-minded, but fear.</hi> Encourage a jealouſy of your ſelf, at leaſt, ſo far as to look over your conduct, and compare it faithfully with that <hi>grand rule</hi> of trial, the <hi>word of</hi> GOD. <hi>I bear you record, you have a zeal of</hi> GOD; but if, in any great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, 'tis a zeal not governed by <hi>knowledge,</hi> or not tempered with <hi>prudence,</hi> or not accompanied with <hi>charity,</hi> you may, be you ever ſo confident you are in the right, bring guilt upon your ſelf, as well as do hurt to others.</p>
            <p>Your deſign, in going thro' the <hi>town,</hi> from one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to another, to examine into their <hi>religious expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences,</hi> you have begun to open. You have not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as yet, <hi>particularly</hi> pronounced ſentence, and call'd upon people, (as has been your uſual way) to <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate</hi> from <hi>this</hi> and the <hi>other</hi> miniſter, as being in a <hi>carnal</hi> ſtate; tho', if I have been rightly inform'd, you have, in general, <hi>addreſs'd to</hi> GOD <hi>in prayer,</hi> as to him <hi>who knew, that the greateſt part of the miniſters in town were unconverted.</hi> How far this may tend to prejudice people againſt their <hi>miniſtry,</hi> I can't certainly ſay; but I have no ſuch apprehenſion of your importance, as to be afraid of any great inconvenience ariſing herefrom.
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:004912_0006_100E192B8DD84BD8"/>
Some over zealous perſons may be made ſtill more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable; but by far the better part of the town, both for <hi>number,</hi> and <hi>ſolid piety,</hi> are aware of this <hi>device of ſatan</hi>; and, I truſt, upon their guard againſt any bad impreſſions from it. I am therefore more concern'd for <hi>you,</hi> than in fear of any hurt you are capable of doing the <hi>miniſters.</hi> You are certainly in a wrong way of thinking, or you would not be able, with the name of GOD in your mouth, to violate that ſolemn ſtatute of heaven, JUDGE NOT.</p>
            <p>Suffer me, <hi>Sir,</hi> to take this opportunity, to beſeech you in the bowels of CHRIST JESUS, and as you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard your own ſoul, to review your conduct in this matter of <hi>raſh, and uncharitable judging</hi> You know, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>worthy miniſters</hi> you have publickly condemned, as <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>unconverted</hi>; tho', ſo far as is viſible, they have been <hi>an example of the believers, in word, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity</hi>: And you know alſo, how, by this means, you have obſtructed their uſefulneſs; alienated the hearts of their people from them; and encouraged heats and animoſities, which have ariſen, in ſome places, to open diviſions and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. And can you reflect upon this, and be eaſy in your mind? Have you had no miſgivings of heart? No in<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>an't but think, this has been, at times, the caſe with you. I am ſure, if you han't been in trouble of ſoul, 'tis not becauſe you han't had juſt reaſon to be ſo: And I believe, if ever GOD gives you a <hi>ſound mind,</hi> you will <hi>cry to him from the deeps,</hi> for this ſtrange conduct you have unhappily fallen into.</p>
            <p>You will doubtleſs ſay, you are in the right; you are ſure of it: Your mind has been <hi>impreſſed</hi> by the DI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VINE SPIRIT; and you act in this matter, under his <hi>ſpecial influence.</hi> But is this any more than every <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt</hi> may plead in vindication of his conduct, be it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo wild? What ſays the apoſtle PAUL, who ſpake under the <hi>inſpiration of</hi> GOD?

What is there, in the ſacred volumes, that will juſtify your going about, from one part of the country to another, enquiring into the ſtate of the ſouls, particularly, of <hi>miniſters,</hi> and declaring them, moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly, unconverted; Tho' they don't open their <hi>hearts</hi> to you, and their <hi>lives</hi> give credit to their profeſſion? What is <hi>judging another man's ſervant,</hi> if this is not? And how can you be ſaid, while you act thus, to be in the exerciſe of <hi>charity,</hi> that <hi>charity</hi> which <hi>thinketh no evil, believeth all things, hopeth all things?</hi> Is there any meaning to theſe texts? Can perſons be at all guilty of the ſin of uncharitable judging? 'Tis hard to ſay, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they can be guilty, if you are not.</p>
            <p>You may, perhaps, plead the danger of an <hi>unconver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted miniſtry</hi> to the ſouls of men. But be the danger of this as great as it will, it can never be a good reaſon, why you ſhould aſſume a <hi>divine prerogative,</hi> and act as tho' you were the <hi>conſtituted judge</hi> of your brethren. 'Tis true, where miniſters make a diſcovery of a <hi>bad heart,</hi> by that which is <hi>outwardly bad,</hi> they may juſtly be condemned: But in no other caſe; to be ſure, not <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly.</hi> We have no way of judging but by what is <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>viſible</hi>: Nor are we capable of judging any other way. And to leave this way, and go into that of judging from <hi>men's hearts</hi>; it tends to nothing, in the nature of things, but to deſtroy the peace of churches, and fill the world with contention and confuſion: And of this you have had proof in your own conduct; ſufficient, if you will ſuitably attend to it, to work conviction in you.</p>
            <p>But this you cannot do, while you give heed to <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſes,</hi> and guide your ſelf by them, taking them for diſcoveries of the will of GOD. Your <hi>grand error</hi> lies here: And 'tis a more dangerous one, than you may be ready to imagine. There is nothing, while in this ſtate of mind, but you may be bro't to: And how far GOD may ſuffer you to be led aſide, is known only to himſelf. Others, who have appear'd as zealous for CHRIST as you have done, have been as bold and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in judging their neighbours, as much under an <hi>ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary</hi> divine conduct in every thing, and as ſure of it
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:004912_0008_100E192E660A6F10"/>
as you have been, have at length run into all the wilds of deluſion. I beg, <hi>Sir,</hi> you would take warning! Whatever you may think of your ſelf, you have cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a <hi>heated imagination.</hi> 'Tis too evident to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, that you too often take the <hi>motions of your own mind,</hi> for <hi>divine communications.</hi> A flagrant inſtance of this, you gave your hearers not long ſince, when you told them, it was <hi>impreſſed upon your mind,</hi> that the <hi>day of judgment was at the door,</hi> and you were as <hi>ſure of it</hi> as of ſome things you then ſaw with your eyes. A <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand enthuſiaſts</hi> have deluded themſelves and others with the <hi>ſame impreſſion,</hi> looking upon it as a <hi>revelation</hi> from GOD: And you might have known it to have been a <hi>vain imagination,</hi> if you had only conſidered, that the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the <hi>time</hi> of the <hi>judgment</hi> is a <hi>ſecret,</hi> the FATHER hath ſo reſerved in <hi>his own breaſt,</hi> as that the SON HIMSELF, as <hi>man,</hi> was <hi>ignorant</hi> of it: And if this day is to come <hi>unawares,</hi> and as a <hi>thief in the night,</hi> you could never be <hi>called</hi> of GOD to give warning of the <hi>time</hi> of <hi>its approach.</hi> To be ſure, if your <hi>impreſſion</hi> about the <hi>nearneſs</hi> of the <hi>judgment</hi> was from GOD, your <hi>propoſal</hi> ſoon after it, to <hi>raiſe monies</hi> for the building a <hi>ſchool,</hi> or <hi>college,</hi> under the name of a <hi>Shepherd's Tent,</hi> that the churches might be ſupplied with <hi>converted mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,</hi> muſt be own'd to have had its riſe from <hi>meer fancy</hi>: And this, no doubt, will generally be the tho't of the <hi>town</hi> upon it; eſpecially, if what is commonly ſaid, be true, that one of the perſons to be concern'd in the management of this affair, is a gentleman that has been lately <hi>turn'd out of the miniſtry,</hi> becauſe among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things, he ſpake moſt contemptuouſly of the <hi>holy ſcriptures.</hi>—But I muſt not be too long.</p>
            <p>And now, having ſpoken my mind ſo freely, if you deal with me as you have done with much better men, I may expect to be called a poor, carnal, unconverted wretch. But I aſſure you beforehand, I eſteem it a <hi>very ſmall thing to be judged by your Judgment</hi>; and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, becauſe I <hi>certainly know,</hi> you are ignorant of my ſtate towards GOD.</p>
            <p>But however you act towards me, I preſume not to <hi>judge you. To your own maſter you ſtand, or fall.</hi> I have
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:004912_0009_100E195D14CBCE88"/>
taken notice only of <hi>that</hi> in you, which is <hi>viſible</hi> to the world; And tho' I have, and do condemn it, as what is oppoſite to the plain laws of GOD; yet, I pronounce no ſentence reſpecting <hi>your ſtate.</hi> GOD knows how far you may be under the power of a <hi>diſturbed imagination,</hi> and will make all the favourable allowances your caſe will admit of: I deſire to do ſo alſo, and would hope the beſt concerning you.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add no more but a couple of paſſages, I think well worthy your ſerious conſideration. One is from Monſieur BANAGE, in his <hi>La Communion Sainte,</hi> page 554, 555.

One would think GOD had committed his juſtice into the hands of theſe rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſpiritual men, who are oftentimes more melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly than holy, that ſo they might exerciſe it with ſupreme authority. Were it even true, that you were the depoſitaries of divine juſtice, don't you know that this depoſitum were dangerous in your hands? Wo to him that abuſes it, that acts by paſſion, or that judges with raſhneſs. <hi>Judge not,</hi> ſays the SAVIOUR of the world; for <hi>with what judgment ye judge ye ſhall be judged.</hi> By what right do you violate the law of your maſter? And why do you judge, when it is forbidden?</q>
            </p>
            <p>The other paſſage is from the famous Mr. JOHN DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VEN PORT, my <hi>predeceſſor,</hi> and your <hi>great-grand-father.</hi> In a <hi>manuſcript ſermon</hi> of his, having admoniſhed the church of GOD, under troubleſome exerciſes, he goes on in theſe words, ——<q>But then, would you prevent ſuch exerciſes for the future, know your duties and do them; neither <hi>out-running your calling by an inordinate zeal,</hi> nor being too ſlow in diſcharging the duties of it.

               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>ANY Things were amiſs in the <hi>Church of Corinth,</hi> when <hi>Paul</hi> wrote this Epiſtle to them. There were envyings, ſtrife and diviſions among them, on account of their miniſters. Some cried up one, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers another: one ſaid, I am of PAUL, another I am of APPOLLOS. They had form'd themſelves into parties, and each party ſo admired the teacher they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, as to reflect unjuſt contempt on the other.</p>
            <p>Nor was this their only fault. A ſpirit of pride pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed exceedingly among them. They were conceited of their gifts, and too generally diſpos'd to make an oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentatious
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004912_0012_100E193363003C50"/>
ſhew of them. From this vain glorious tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per proceeded the forwardneſs of thoſe that had the <hi>gift</hi> of <hi>tongues,</hi> to ſpeak in languages which others did not underſtand, to the diſturbance, rather than edification of the church: And from the ſame principle it aroſe, that they ſpake not by turns, but ſeveral at once, in the ſame place of worſhip, to the introducing ſuch confuſion, that they were in danger of being tho't mad.</p>
            <p>Nor were they without ſome pretence to juſtify theſe diſorders. Their great plea was, that in theſe things they were guided by the Spirit, acted under his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate influence and direction. This ſeems plainly inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated in the words I have read to you. <hi>If any man think himſelf to be a prophet, or ſpiritual, let him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the things that I write unto you are the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of the Lord.</hi> As if the apoſtle had ſaid, you may imagine your ſelves to be <hi>ſpiritual</hi> men, to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a divine afflatus in what you do; but 'tis all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, meer pretence, unleſs you pay a due regard to the <hi>commandments</hi> I have here <hi>wrote to you</hi>; receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them not as the <hi>word of man, but of</hi> GOD. Make trial of your ſpiritual pretences by this rule: If you can ſubmit to it, and will order your conduct by it, well; otherwiſe you only cheat yourſelves, while you think yourſelves to be <hi>ſpiritual</hi> men, or <hi>prophets</hi>: You are nothing better than <hi>Enthuſiaſts</hi>; your being acted by the SPIRIT, immediately guided and influenced by him, is meer pretence; you have no good reaſon to believe any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p>From the words thus explained, I ſhall take occaſion to diſcourſe to you upon the following Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall give you ſome account of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> in its <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>influence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. Point you to a rule by which you may judge of perſons, whether they are under the influence of <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Say what may be proper to guard you againſt this unhappy turn of mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004912_0013_100E19612B7411B8"/>The whole will then be follow'd with ſome ſuitable Application.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am in the firſt place, to give you ſome account of <hi>Enthuſiaſm.</hi> And as this is a thing much talk'd of at preſent, more perhaps than at any other time that has paſs'd over us, it will not be tho't unreaſonable, if I take ſome pains to let you into a true underſtanding of it.</p>
            <p>The word, from it's Etymology, carries in it a good meaning, as ſignifying <hi>inſpiration from</hi> GOD: in which ſenſe, the prophets under the old teſtament, and the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles under the new, might properly be called <hi>Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſts.</hi> For they were under a divine influence, ſpake as moved by the HOLY GHOST, and did ſuch things as can be accounted for in no way, but by recurring to an immediate extraordinary power, preſent with them.</p>
            <p>But the word is more commonly uſed in a bad ſenſe, as intending an <hi>imaginary,</hi> not a <hi>real</hi> inſpiration: accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to which ſenſe, the <hi>Enthuſiaſt</hi> is one, who has a conceit of himſelf as a perſon favoured with the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary preſence of the <hi>Deity.</hi> He miſtakes the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his own paſſions for divine communications, and fancies himſelf immediately inſpired by the SPIRIT of GOD, when all the while, he is under no other influence than that of an over-heated imagination.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of this <hi>enthuſiaſm</hi> is a bad temperament of the blood and ſpirits; 'tis properly a diſeaſe, a ſort of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: And there are few; perhaps, none at all, but are ſubject to it; tho' none are ſo much in danger of it as thoſe, in whom <hi>melancholy</hi> is the prevailing ingredient in their conſtitution. In theſe it often reigns; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſo great a degree, that they are really beſide themſelves, acting as truly by the blind impetus of a wild fancy, as tho' they had neither reaſon nor underſtanding.</p>
            <p>And various are the ways in which their <hi>enthuſiaſm</hi> diſcovers itſelf.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, it may be ſeen in their countenance. A certain wildneſs is diſcernable in their general look and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004912_0014_100E1934E436D408"/>
air; eſpecially when their imaginations are mov'd and fired.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, it ſtrangely looſens their tongues, and gives them ſuch an energy, as well as fluency and volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in ſpeaking, as they themſelves, by their utmoſt efforts, can't ſo much as imitate, when they are not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the enthuſiaſtick influence.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, it affects their bodies, throws them into convulſions and diſtortions, into quakings and tremblings. This was formerly common among the people called <hi>Quakers.</hi> I was myſelf, when a Lad, an eye-witneſs to ſuch violent agitations and foamings, in a boiſterous fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſpeaker, as I could not behold but with ſurprize and wonder.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, it will unaccountably mix itſelf with their conduct, and give it ſuch a tincture of that which is freakiſh or furious, as none can have an idea of, but thoſe who have ſeen the behaviour of a perſon in a phrenzy.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, it appears in their imaginary peculiar inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy with heaven. They are, in their own opinion, the ſpecial favourites of GOD, have more familiar con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him than other good men, and receive immediate, extraordinary communications from him. The tho'ts, which ſuddenly riſe up in their minds, they take for ſuggeſtions of the SPIRIT; their very fancies are divine illuminations; nor are they ſtrongly inclin'd to any thing, but 'tis an impulſe from GOD, a plain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his will.</p>
            <p>And what extravagances, in this temper of mind, are they not capable of, and under the ſpecious pretext too of paying obedience to the authority of GOD? Many have fancied themſelves acting by immediate warrant from heaven, while they have been committing the moſt undoubted wickedneſs. There is indeed ſcarce any thing ſo wild, either in <hi>ſpeculation</hi> or <hi>practice,</hi> but they have given unto it: They have, in many inſtances,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004912_0015_100E196409171E30"/>
been blaſphemers of GOD, and open diſturbers of the peace of the world.</p>
            <p>But in nothing does the <hi>enthuſiaſm</hi> of theſe perſons diſcover it ſelf more, than in the diſregard they expreſs to the Dictates of <hi>reaſon.</hi> They are above the force of argument, beyond conviction from a calm and ſober ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to their underſtandings. As for them, they are diſtinguiſh'd perſons; GOD himſelf ſpeaks inwardly and immediately to their ſouls. <q>They ſee the light infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed into their underſtandings, and cannot be miſtaken; 'tis clear and viſible there, like the light of bright ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine; ſhews it ſelf and needs no other proof but its own evidence. They feel the hand of GOD moving them within, and the impulſes of his SPIRIT; and cannot be miſtaken in what they feel. Thus they ſupport themſelves, and are ſure reaſon hath nothing to do with what they ſee and feel. What they have a ſenſible experience of, admits no doubt, needs no probation</q>. And in vain will you endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſuch perſons of any miſtakes they are fallen into. They are certainly in the right; and know themſelves to be ſo. They have the SPIRIT opening their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings and revealing the truth to them. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve only as he has taught them: and to ſuſpect they are in the wrong is to do diſhonour to the SPIRIT; 'tis to oppoſe his dictates, to ſet up their own wiſdom in oppoſition to his, and ſhut their eyes againſt that light with which he has ſhined into their ſouls. They are not therefore capable of being argued with; you had as good reaſon with the wind.</p>
            <p>And as the natural conſequence of their being thus ſure of every thing, they are not only infinitely ſtiff and tenacious, but impatient of contradiction, cenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and uncharitable: they encourage a good opinion of none but ſuch as are in their way of thinking and ſpeaking. Thoſe, to be ſure, who venture to debate with them about their errors and miſtakes, their weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes and indiſcretions, run the hazard of being ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiz'd by them as poor unconverted wretches, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the SPIRIT, under the government of carnal reaſon, enemies to GOD and religion, and in the broad way to hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004912_0016_100E1936DABD90D8"/>They are likewiſe poſitive and dogmatical, vainly fond of their own imaginations, and invincibly ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on propagating them: And in the doing of this, their Powers being awakened, and pu<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as it were, upon the ſtretch, from the ſtrong impreſſions they are under, that they are authorized by the immediate command of GOD himſelf, they ſometimes exert themſelves with a ſort of <hi>extatic</hi> violence: And 'tis this that gives them the advantage, among the leſs knowing and judicious, of thoſe who are modeſt, ſuſpicious of themſelves, and not too aſſuming in matters of conſcience and ſalvation. The extraordinary fervour of their minds, accompanied with uncommon bodily motions, and an exceſſive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence and aſſurance, gains them great reputation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the populace; who ſpeak of them as <hi>men of GOD</hi> in diſtinction from all others, and too commonly heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to, and revere their dictates, as tho' they really were, as they pretend, immediately communicated to them from the DIVINE SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>This is the nature of <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and this its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in a leſs or greater degree, in all who are under the influence of it. 'Tis a kind of religious Phrenzy, and evidently diſcovers it ſelf to be ſo, whenever it riſes to any great height.</p>
            <p>And much to be pitied are the perſons who are ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it. Our compaſſion commonly works towards thoſe, who, while under diſtraction, fondly imagine themſelves to be Kings and Emperors: And the like pity is really due to thoſe, who, under the power of <hi>enthuſiaſm,</hi> fancy themſelves to be <hi>prophets; inſpired of God,</hi> and <hi>immediately called</hi> and <hi>commiſſioned by him to deliver his meſſages to the world:</hi> And tho' they ſhould run into diſorders, and act in a manner that cannot but be condemned, they ſhould notwithſtanding be treated with tenderneſs and lenity; and the rather, becauſe they don't commonly act ſo much under the influence of a <hi>bad mind,</hi> as a <hi>deluded imagination.</hi> And who more worthy of chriſtian pity than thoſe, who, under the notion of ſerving GOD and the intereſt of religion, are filled with zeal, and exert themſelves to the utmoſt, while all the time they are hurting and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004912_0017_100DEFCD43C55118"/>
wounding the very cauſe they take ſo much pains to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance. 'Tis really a pitiable caſe: And tho' the honeſty of their intentions won't legitimate their bad actions, yet it very much alleviates their guilt: We ſhould think as favourably of them as may be, and be diſpos'd to judge with mercy, as we would hope to obtain mercy.</p>
            <p>But I come</p>
            <p n="2">II In the ſecond place, to point you to a <hi>rule</hi> by which you may judge of perſons, whether they are <hi>enthuſiaſts,</hi> meer pretenders to the immediate guidance and influence of the SPIRIT. And this is, in general, <hi>a regard to the bible, an acknowledgment that the things therein contained are the commandments of GOD.</hi> This is the rule in the text. And 'tis an infallible rule of tryal in this matter: We need not fear judging amiſs, while we keep cloſely to it.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, it wont certainly follow, that a man, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to be a <hi>prophet,</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> really is ſo, if he owns the <hi>bible,</hi> and receives the truths therein reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the mind of GOD: But the concluſion, on the other hand, is clear and certain; if he pretends to be conducted by the SPIRIT, and diſregards the ſcripture, pays no due reverence to <hi>the things there delivered as the commandments of GOD,</hi> he is a meer pretender, be his pretences ever ſo bold and confident, or made with ever ſo much ſeeming ſeriouſneſs, gravity, or ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
            <p>And the reaſon of this is obvious; viz that the things contained in the ſcripture were wrote by holy men as they were moved by the HOLY GHOST: they were received from GOD, and committed to writing under his immediate, extraordinary influence and gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. And the divine, ever-bleſſed SPIRIT is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with himſelf. He cannot be ſuppos'd to be the author of any <hi>private</hi> revelations that are contradictory to the <hi>public ſtanding</hi> ones, which he has preſerved in the world to this day. This would be to ſet the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT of truth at variance with himſelf; than which a greater reproach can't be caſt upon him. 'Tis there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as true, that thoſe are <hi>enthuſiaſtical,</hi> who pretend
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004912_0018_100E193A67EC4E70"/>
to the SPIRIT, and at the ſame time expreſs a diſregard to the ſcripture, as that the SPIRIT is the great revealer of the things therein declared to us. And we may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the certainty of this conclusion. We have warrant to do ſo from the <hi>inſpired Paul</hi>; and we have the more reaſon to rely upon the rule he has given us, as he has made it evident to the world, that he was a <hi>prophet,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> by ſigns and wonders which he did before the people, by the power of the SPIRIT of GOD.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>rule</hi> in the text is yet more particular. It refers eſpecially to <hi>the things wrote by the apoſtle</hi> PAUL, and which he wrote to the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to rectify the <hi>diſorders</hi> that had crept in among them. And who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the perſon be, that pretends to be <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> to be under the extraordinary guidance of the SPIRIT, and yet acts in contradiction to what the apoſtle has here wrote, he vainly imagines himſelf to be under the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial guidance of the SPIRIT; he is a downright <hi>enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here ſuffer me to make particular mention of ſome of the things, the apoſtle has wrote in <hi>this Epiſtle,</hi> which, whoever will not acknowledge, in <hi>deed</hi> as well as <hi>word,</hi> to be the <hi>commandments of GOD,</hi> they are not guided by the SPIRIT, but vainly pretend to be ſo.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing, in this kind, I would mention, is that which relates to <hi>Miniſters</hi>; condemning an undue preference of one to another, the holding one in ſuch admiration as to reflect diſgrace on another. This was one of the diſorders the Apoſtle takes notice of, as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi>; and he is particular in his care to give check to this unchriſtian ſpirit, which had crumbled them into parties, and introduced among them faction and contention.</p>
            <p>Now, whoever, under the pretence of being guided by the ſpirit, ſet up one miniſter in oppoſition to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther glory in this miniſter to the throwing undue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt on that, thereby obſtructing his uſefulneſs, and making way for ſtrife and diviſions, they are not really
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004912_0019_100E196908A6EF70"/>
acted by the SPIRIT, whatever they may pretend. For they evidently contradict what the apoſtle has wrote upon this very head: And if <hi>he</hi> was inſpired, the ſpirit <hi>they</hi> are influenced by, cannot be the SPIRIT of <hi>GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that one miniſter may not be preferr'd to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; this is reaſonable: But no miniſter ought to be regarded, as tho' he was the author of our faith; nor, let his gifts and graces be what they will, is he to be ſo eſteemed, as that others muſt be neglected, or treated in an unbecoming manner. But I ſhall not enlarge here, having ſpoken fully to this point, in a Sermon you may, ſome of you, have in your hands.</p>
            <p>Another thing the apoſtle is particular in writing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, is the <hi>commandment</hi> of <hi>charity.</hi> And this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to be a matter of ſuch eſſential importance in true chriſtianity, that if a man is really deſtitute of it, he is nothing in the ſight of GOD: Nay, tho' his pretences, his attainments, his gifts, be ever ſo extraordinary or miraculous; ſtill, if he is without charity he will cetainly be rejected of GOD and the LORD JESUS CHRIST. This is beautifully repreſented in the three firſt verſes of the 13th chapter of this Epiſtle, in ſome of the boldeſt figures. "Tho' I ſpeak, ſays the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as ſounding braſs, or a tink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling cymbal. And tho' I have the gift of prophecy, and underſtand all myſteries and all knowledge; and tho' I have all faith, ſo that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. And tho' I beſtow all my goods to feed the poor, and tho' I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing." As if the apoſtle had ſaid, tho' a man had the languages of all nations, and could ſpeak with the elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of angels; tho', like an inſpired prophet, he had underſtanding in the deep counſels of GOD, and knew even all things ſacred and divine; tho' he had the faith of miracles, and could do impoſſibilities; tho' he had the zeal of a martyr, and ſhould give his body to be burned; tho' he had a diſpoſition to alms-giving, and ſhould beſtow upon the poor his whole ſubſtance;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004912_0020_100E193CD80742A8"/>
ſtill, if he was without charity, "that charity which ſuffereth long, and is kind; that charity which envyeth not, vaunteth not it ſelf, is not puffed up; that charity which behaveth not it ſelf unſeemly, ſeeketh not her own, is not eaſily provoked, thinketh no evil, rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; that charity, in fine, which beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things"; I ſay, if he was without this charity, this love of his neighbour, theſe things would be all nothing; he would notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding be out of favour with GOD, without any inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in CHRIST<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in ſuch circumſtances, as that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there was a change in them, he would certainly periſh.</p>
            <p>This, in ſum, is what the apoſtle has, in a diſtinct and peremptory manner, delivered concerning charity.</p>
            <p>And in vain may any pretend to be under the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary guidance of the SPIRIT, while in their practice they trample upon this law of chriſtian love. Men may talk of their <hi>impulſes</hi> and <hi>impreſſions,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of them as the call of GOD, and go about, as moved by them, from place to place, imagining they are ſent of GOD, and immediately commiſſioned by him: But if they are cenſorious and uncharitable; if they harbour in their minds evil ſurmiſings of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; if they ſlander and reproach them; if they claim a rights to look into their hearts, make it their buſineſs to judge of their ſtate, and proclaim them hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, carnal unregenerate ſinners, when at the ſame time they are viſibly of a good converſation in CHRIST; I ſay, when this is the practice of any, they do not acknowledge what the inſpired PAUL has here <hi>wrote as the commandment of GOD</hi>: They are not therefore acted by the ſame SPIRIT with which he ſpake; but are evidently under a ſpirit of deluſion: And this is ſo obviouſly the caſe, that there is no reaſonable room to doubt upon the matter.</p>
            <p>Charity, my brethren, is the commandment of the goſpel by way of eminence. 'Tis the grand mark by which chriſtians are to diſtinguiſh themſelves from all
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004912_0021_100E196C4B733E70"/>
others. <hi>By this,</hi> ſays our SAVIOUR<note n="*" place="bottom">John 13.35.</note>, <hi>ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love to one another:</hi> Yea, this is the grand criterion by which we are to judge, whither GOD <hi>dwelleth in us by his SPIRIT. If we love one another, GOD dwelleth in us</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">1 John 4.12.</note>. And in the following Verſe, <hi>Hereby,</hi> i e. by our loving one another, <hi>we know that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his SPIRIT.</hi> To pretend therefore that we are led by the SPIRIT, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his extraordinary influence, when, in contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the plain laws of JESUS CHRIST, revealed by the SPIRIT, we <hi>judge our brother,</hi> and <hi>ſet at naught our brother,</hi> and plead a right to do ſo, and are in a diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion TO THANK GOD, THAT WE ARE ENABLED TO DO SO; there is not a more ſure mark, in all the revelations of GOD, of a BAD HEART, or a DISTEM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PERED MIND. If any thing will evidence a man to be a <hi>prophet</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> only in his own conceit, this muſt do it: And if this is not allow'd to be ſufficient proof, there is no knowing, when a man is under the influence of <hi>enthuſiaſtick</hi> heat and zeal.</p>
            <p>Another thing the apoſtle beſpeaks this church upon, is that <hi>ſelf-conceit</hi> which appear'd among them in the exerciſe of <hi>ſpiritual gifts</hi>: And 'tis more than probable, there were thoſe among them, who being vainly puffed up in their minds, behaved as tho' they were <hi>apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>prophets,</hi> or <hi>teachers</hi>; leaving their own ſtation, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the work that was proper to others. It was to rectify ſuch diſorders, that the apoſtle, in the 12th chapter, addreſſes to them in that language, v. 29. <hi>Are all apoſtles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers?</hi> The queſtion carries with it it's own anſwer, and means the ſame thing, as when he affirms in the foregoing verſe <hi>God hath ſet ſome in the church, firſt apoſtles, ſecondarily prophets, thirdly teachers,</hi> and ſo on. 'Tis evident from what the apoſtle here writes, and indeed from the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſtrain of this whole chapter, that there is in the body of CHRIST, the Church, a diſtinction of members; ſome intended for one uſe, others for another; and that it would bring confuſion into the <hi>body myſtical,</hi> for one
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004912_0022_100E193EB414A828"/>
member to be employed in that ſervice which is adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to another, and is its proper buſineſs.</p>
            <p>'Tis not therefore the pretence of being moved by the SPIRIT, that will juſtify <hi>private chriſtians</hi> in quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own proper ſtation, to act in that which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to another. Such a practice as this naturally tends to deſtroy that order, GOD has conſtituted in the church, and may be followed with miſchiefs greater than we may be aware of.</p>
            <p>'Tis indeed a powerful argument with many, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of theſe perſons, their pretending to <hi>impulſes,</hi> and a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>e by the apoſtle as the <hi>commandment of</hi> GOD, that there ſhould be <hi>officers</hi> in the church, an <hi>order of men</hi> to whom it ſhould belong, as their <hi>proper, ſtated work,</hi> to exhort and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>each, this cannot be the buſineſs of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: And if any who think themſelves to be <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> are under <hi>impreſſions</hi> to take upon them <hi>this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,</hi> they may have reaſon to ſuſpect, whether their <hi>impulſes</hi> are any other than the workings of their own imaginations: And inſtead of being under any divine extraordinary influence, there are juſt grounds of fear, whether they are not acted from the vanity of their minds: Eſpecially, if they are but beginners in religion; men of weak minds, babes in underſtanding; as is moſt commonly the eaſe. The apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>novices,</hi> as in danger of being <hi>lifted up with pride, and falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the condemnation of the devil</hi>: And it is a ſeaſonable caution to th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And indeed, if the SPIRIT has bid men to <hi>abide in their own callings,</hi> 'tis not conceivable he ſhould influence them to <hi>leave their callings</hi>: And if he has ſet a mark of diſgrace upon <hi>buſiy-bodies in other men's matters,</hi> 'tis impoſſible he ſhould put men upon <hi>wa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004912_0023_100E196DCD8AA4F0"/>And it deſerves particular conſideration, whether the ſuffering, much more the encouraging WOMEN, yea, GIRLS to ſpeak in the aſſemblies for religious worſhip, is not a plain breach of that <hi>commandment of the</hi> LORD<note n="*" place="bottom">Context, v. 35, 26.</note>, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>Let your</hi> WOMEN <hi>keep ſilence in the churches; for it is not permitted to them to ſpeak — It is a ſhame for</hi> WOMEN <hi>to ſpeak in the church.</hi> After ſuch an expreſs conſtitution, deſignedly made to reſtrain WOMEN from ſpeaking in the church, with what face can ſuch a practice be pleaded for? They may pretend, they are moved by the SPIRIT, and ſuch a tho't of themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> may be encouraged by others; but if the apoſtle <hi>ſpake by the</hi> SPIRIT, when he delivered <hi>this commandment,</hi> they can't <hi>act by the</hi> SPIRIT when they break it. 'Tis a plain caſe, theſe FEMALE EXHORTERS are condemned by the apoſtle; and if 'tis the <hi>command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the</hi> LORD, that they ſhould not ſpeak, they are <hi>ſpiritual</hi> only in their own tho'ts, while they attempt to do ſo.</p>
            <p>The laſt thing I ſhall mention as written by the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, is that which obliges to a <hi>juſt decorum in ſpeaking</hi> in the <hi>houſe of GOD.</hi> It was an extravagance theſe <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi> had fallen into, their ſpeaking many of them together, and upon different things, while in the ſame place of worſhip. <hi>How is it, brethren,</hi> ſays the apoſtle? <hi>When ye come together, every one hath a pſalm; hath a doctrine; hath a tongue; hath a revelation; hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatien.</hi> It was this that introduced the confuſion and noiſe, upon which the apoſtle declares, if an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever ſhould come in among them, he would take them to be mad<note n="†" place="bottom">v. 23.</note>.

               <note n="‖" place="bottom">26, 27.</note>.</p>
            <p>And whoever the perſons are, who will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge what the apoſtle has here ſaid is the <hi>commandment of</hi> GOD, and act accordingly, are influenced by another

               </gap>ences what they will. The diſorder of EXHOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TING, and PRAYING, and SINGING, and LAUGHING, <hi>in the ſame houſe of worſhip, at one and the ſame time,</hi> is as great as was that, the apoſtle blames in the <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Corinth:</hi> And whatever the perſons, guilty of ſuch groſs irregularity may imagine, and however they may plead their being under the influence of the SPIRIT, and mov'd by him, 'tis evidently a breach upon common or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and decency; yea, a direct violation of the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of</hi> GOD, written on purpoſe to prevent ſuch diſorders: And to pretend the direction of the SPIRIT in ſuch a flagrant inſtance of extravagant conduct, is to reproach the bleſſed SPIRIT, who is not, as the apoſtle's phraſe is, <hi>the author of confuſion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the ſaints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe, and all other inſtances, let us compare men's pretences to the SPIRIT by the SCRIPTURE: And if their conduct is ſuch as can't be reconcil'd with an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the things therein revealed, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of</hi> GOD, their pretences are vain, they are <hi>prophets</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> only in their own proud imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I proceed now to</p>
            <p n="3">III. The third thing, which is to caution you a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt giving way to <hi>enthuſiaſtic impreſſions.</hi> And here much might be ſaid,</p>
            <p>I might warn you from the <hi>diſhonour</hi> it reflects upon the SPIRIT of GOD. And perhaps none have more reproach'd the bleſſed SPIRIT, than men pretending to be under his extraordinary guidance and direction. The veryeſt fancies, the vaineſt imaginations, the ſtrongeſt deluſions, they have father'd on him. There is ſcarce any abſurdity in <hi>principle,</hi> or irregularity in <hi>practice,</hi> but he has been made the patron of it. — And what a ſtone of ſtumbling has the wildneſs of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm</hi> been to multitudes in the world? What pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices have been hereby excited in their minds againſt the very being of the SPIRIT? What temptations have been thrown in their way to diſpute his OFFICE
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004912_0025_100E196F859E6678"/>
as the SANCTIFYER and COMFORTER of GOD's people? And how have they been over-come to diſown HIS WORK, when it has been really wro't in the hearts of men?</p>
            <p>I might alſo warn you from the damage it has done in the world. No greater miſchiefs have ariſen from any quarter. It is indeed the genuine ſource of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite evil. POPERY it ſelf han't been the mother of more and greater blaſphemies and abominations. It has made ſtrong attempts to deſtroy all property, to make all things common, <hi>wives</hi> as well as <hi>goods.</hi> — It has promoted faction and contention; filled the church oftentimes with confuſion, and the ſtate ſometimes with general diſorder. — It has, by its pretended ſpiritual interpretations, made void the moſt undoubted laws of GOD. It has laid aſide the <hi>goſpel ſacraments</hi> as weak and carnal things; yea, this <hi>ſuperior light within</hi> has, in the opinion of thouſands, render'd the <hi>bible</hi> a <hi>uſeleſs dead letter.</hi> — It has made men fancy themſelves to be <hi>prophets</hi> and <hi>apoſtles</hi>; yea, ſome have taken themſelves to be CHRIST JESUS; yea, the bleſſed GOD himſelf. It has, in one word, been a peſt to the church in all ages, as great an enemy to real and ſolid religion, as perhaps the groſſeſt <hi>infidelity.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Undoubted inſtances of theſe, and many other things of a like nature, are well known to ſuch as are, in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, acquainted with the <hi>hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>church.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>I might go on and warn you from the danger of it to yourſelves. If you ſhould once come under the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of it, none can tell whither it would carry you. There is nothing ſo wild and frantick, but you may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd to it. And if this ſhou'd be your caſe, your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to a right mind would be one of the moſt difficult things in nature. There is no coming at a thorow-pac'd <hi>enthuſiaſt.</hi> He is proof againſt every method of dealing with him. Would you apply to him from reaſon? That he eſteems a carnal thing, and flees from it as from the moſt dangerous temptation. Would you riſe higher,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004912_0026_100E1943EE928410"/>
and ſpeak to him from <hi>Scripture</hi>? It will be to as little purpoſe. For if he pays any regard to it, 'tis only as it falls in with his own pre-conceiv'd notions. He inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prets the ſcripture by <hi>impulſes</hi> and <hi>impreſſions,</hi> and ſees no meaning in it, only as he explains it from his own fancy.—'Tis infinitely difficult convince a man grown giddy and conceited under the falſe notion, that the good SPIRIT teaches him every thing. His apprehended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration ſets him above all means of conviction. He ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſpiſes than hearkens to the moſt reaſonable advices that can be given him.</p>
            <p>But as the moſt ſuitable guard againſt the firſt tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies towards <hi>enthuſiaſm,</hi> let me recommend to you the following words of counſel.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Get a true underſtanding of the <hi>proper work of the</hi> SPIRIT; and don't place it in thoſe things wherein the goſpel does not make it to conſiſt. The work of the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT is different now from what it was in the firſt days of chriſtianity. Men were then favoured with the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary preſence of the SPIRIT. He came upon them in miraculous gifts and powers; as a ſpirit of prophecy, of knowledge, of revelation, of tongue, of miracles: But the SPIRIT is not now to be expected in theſe ways. His grand buſineſs lies in preparing men's minds for the grace of GOD, by true <hi>humiliation,</hi> from an apprehenſion of ſin, and the neceſſity of a <hi>Saviour</hi>; then in working in them <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>repentance,</hi> and ſuch a <hi>change</hi> as ſhall <hi>turn them from the power of ſin and ſatan unto</hi> GOD; and in fine, by carrying on the good work he has begun in them; aſſiſting them in duty, ſtrengthening them againſt temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and in a word, preſerving them blameleſs thro' faith unto ſalvation: And all this he does by the <hi>word</hi> and <hi>paayer,</hi> as the great means in the accompliſhment of theſe purpoſes of mercy.</p>
            <p>Herein, in general, conſiſts the work of the SPIRIT. It does not lie in giving men <hi>private revelations,</hi> but in opening their minds to underſtand the <hi>publick ones</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſcripture. It does not lie in <hi>ſudden impul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and <hi>impreſſions,</hi> in <hi>immediate calls</hi> and <hi>extraordinary miſſions.</hi> Men miſtake the buſineſs of the SPIRIT, if
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004912_0027_100E197152B2DD80"/>
they underſtand by it ſuch things as theſe. And 'tis, probably, from ſuch unhappy miſtakes, that they are at firſt betrayed into <hi>enthuſiaſm.</hi> Having a wrong notion of the <hi>work of</hi> the SPIRIT, 'tis no wonder if they take the uncommon ſallies of their own minds for his influences.</p>
            <p>You cannot, my brethren, be too well acquainted with what the <hi>bible</hi> makes the <hi>work</hi> of the HOLY GHOST, in the affair of ſalvation: And if you have upon your minds a clear and diſtinct underſtanding of this, it will be a powerful guard to you againſt all <hi>enthuſiaſtical im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Keep cloſe to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and admit of nothing for an impreſſion of the SPIRIT, but what agrees with that unerring rule. Fix it in your minds as a truth you will invariably abide by, that the <hi>bible</hi> is the grand teſt, by which every thing in religion is to be tried; and that you can, at no time, nor in any inſtance, be under the guidance of the SPIRIT of GOD, much leſs his <hi>extraordinary</hi> guidance, if what you are led to, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the things there revealed, either in point of <hi>faith</hi> or <hi>practice.</hi> And let it be your care to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the motions of your minds, and the workings of your imaginations and paſſions, with the <hi>rule</hi> of GOD's <hi>word.</hi> And ſee to it, that you be impartial in this matter: Don't make the rule bend to your pre-conceiv'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inclinations; but repair to the <hi>bible,</hi> with a mind diſpos'd, as much as may be, to know the truth as it lies nakedly and plainly in the <hi>ſcripture</hi> it ſelf. And whatever you are moved to, reject the motion, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem it as nothing more than a vain fancy, if it puts you upon any method of <hi>thinking,</hi> or <hi>acting,</hi> that can't be evidently reconcil'd with the <hi>revelations</hi> of GOD in <hi>his word.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This adherence to the bible, my brethren, is one of the beſt preſervatives againſt <hi>enthuſiaſm.</hi> If you will but expreſs a due reverence to this <hi>book</hi> of GOD, making it the great rule of judgment, even in reſpect of the SPIRIT's <hi>influences</hi> and <hi>operations,</hi> you will not be in much danger of being led into deluſion. Let that be your inquiry under all ſuppos'd <hi>impulſes</hi> from the SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004912_0028_100E1945714D79A8"/>
               <hi>What ſalth the ſcripture? To the law, and to the teſtimony:</hi> If your impreſſions, and imagined ſpiritual motions agree not therewith, 'tis becauſe there is no hand of the SPIRIT of GOD in them: They are only the workings of your own imaginations, or ſomething worſe; and muſt at once, without any more ado, be rejected as ſuch.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Make uſe of the <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Underſtanding</hi> GOD has given you. This may be tho't an ill-advis'd direction, but 'tis as neceſſary as either of the former. Next to the <hi>Scripture,</hi> there is no greater enemy to <hi>enthuſiaſm,</hi> than <hi>reaſon.</hi> 'Tis indeed impoſſible a man ſhou'd be an <hi>enthuſiaſt,</hi> who is in the juſt exerciſe of his underſtanding; and 'tis becauſe men don't pay a due regard to the ſober dictates of a well inform'd mind, that they are led aſide by the deluſions of a vain imagination. Be adviſed then to ſhew yourſelves men, to make uſe of your reaſonable powers; and not act as the <hi>horſe</hi> or <hi>mule,</hi> as tho' you had no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, you muſt not go about to ſet up your own <hi>reaſon</hi> in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to <hi>revelation</hi>: Nor may you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a tho't of making <hi>reaſon</hi> your <hi>rule</hi> inſtead of <hi>ſcripture.</hi> The <hi>bible,</hi> as I ſaid before, is the <hi>great rule</hi> of religion, the grand teſt in matters of ſalvation: But then, you muſt uſe your reaſon in order to underſtand the <hi>bible:</hi> Nor is there any other poſſible way, in which, as a reaſonable creature, you ſhou'd come to an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of it.</p>
            <p>You are, it muſt be acknowledged, in a corrupt ſtate. The fall has introduc'd great weakneſs into your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable nature. You can't be too ſenſible of this; nor of the danger you are in of making a wrong judgment, thro' prejudice, careleſſneſs, and the undue influence of ſin and luſt. And to prevent this, you can't be too ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to get your <hi>nature ſanctified</hi>: Nor can you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend too ſtrongly upon the divine grace to aſſiſt you in your ſearch after truth: And 'tis in the way of due dependance on GOD, and the influences of his SPIRIT, that I adviſe you to the uſe of your reaſon: And in this way, you muſt make uſe of it. How elſe will you
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004912_0029_100E19749AA0CD90"/>
know what is a revelation from GOD? What ſhou'd hinder your entertaining the ſame tho't of a <hi>pretended</hi> revelation, as of a <hi>real</hi> one, but your reaſon diſcovering the falſhood of the one, and the truth of the other? And when in the enjoyment of an undoubted revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from GOD, as in the caſe of the <hi>ſcripture,</hi> How will you underſtand its meaning, if you throw by your reaſon? How will you determine, that this, and not that, is its true ſenſe, in this and the other place? Nay, if no reaſoning is to be made uſe of, are not all the ſenſes that can be put on ſcripture equally proper? Yea, may not the moſt contrary ſenſes be receiv'd at the ſame time ſince reaſon only can point out the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency between them? And what will be ſufficient to guard you againſt the moſt monſtrous extravagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in <hi>principle</hi> as well as <hi>practice,</hi> if you give up your underſtandings? What have you left, in this caſe, to be a check to the wantoneſs of your imaginations? What ſhou'd hinder your following every idle fancy, 'till you have loſt yourſelves in the wilds of falſhood and inconſiſtency?</p>
            <p>You may, it is true, miſuſe your reaſon: And this is a conſideration that ſhou'd put you upon a due care, that you may uſe it well; but no argument why you ſhou'd not uſe it at all: And indeed, if you ſhou'd throw by your reaſon as a uſeleſs thing, you would at once put your ſelves in the way of all manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion.</p>
            <p>But, it may be, you will ſay, you have committed yourſelves to the <hi>guidance</hi> of the SPIRIT; which is the beſt preſervative. Herein you have done well; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be objected againſt this method of conduct: Only take heed of miſtakes, touching the SPIRIT's <hi>guidance.</hi> Let me enquire of you, how is it the SPIRIT preſerves from deluſion? Is it not by opening the underſtanding, and enabling the man, in the due uſe of his reaſon, to perceive the truth of the things of GOD and religion? Moſt certainly: And, if you think of being led by the SPIRIT without underſtanding, or in oppoſition to it, you deceive yourſelves. The SPIRIT of GOD deals with men as <hi>reaſonable</hi> creatures: And
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004912_0030_100E1947F2732558"/>
they ought to deal with themſelves in like manner And while they do thus, making is wiſe and good uſe of the underſtanding, GOD has given them, they will take a proper means to prevent their falling into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions; nor will there be much danger of their being led aſide by <hi>enthuſiaſtic</hi> heat and imagination.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You muſt not lay too great ſtreſs upon the <hi>work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> of your <hi>paſſions</hi> and <hi>affections.</hi> Theſe will be exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, in a leſs or greater degree, in the buſineſs of religion: And 'tis proper they ſhou'd. The paſſions, when ſuitably mov'd, tend mightily to awaken the <hi>reaſonable powers,</hi> and put them upon a lively and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous exerciſe. And this is their proper uſe: And when addreſs'd to, and excited to this purpoſe, they may be of good ſervice: whereas we ſhall miſtake the right uſe of the paſſions, if we place our religion <hi>only</hi> or <hi>chiefly,</hi> in the heat and fervour of them. The <hi>ſoul</hi> is the <hi>man</hi>: And unleſs the <hi>reaſonable nature</hi> is ſuitably wro't upon, the <hi>underſtanding</hi> enlightned, the <hi>judgment</hi> convinc'd, the <hi>will</hi> perſwaded, and the <hi>mind</hi> intirely chang'd, it will avail but to little purpoſe; tho' the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſhou'd be ſet all in a blaze. This therefore you ſhou'd be moſt concern'd about. And if while you are ſollicitous that you may be in tranſports of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, you neglect your more noble part, your reaſon and judgment, you will be in great danger of being carried away by your imaginations. This indeed leads directly to <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi>: And you will in vain, endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve yourſelves from the influence of it, if you a'nt duly careful to keep your paſſions in their proper place, under the government of a well inform'd underſtanding. While the paſſions are uppermoſt, and bear the chief ſway over a man, he is in an unſafe ſtate: None knows what he may be bro't to. You can't therefore be too careful to keep your paſſions under the regimen of a <hi>ſober judgment.</hi> 'Tis indeed a matter of neceſſity, as you would not be led aſide by deluſion and fancy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In the laſt place here, you muſt not forget to go to GOD by <hi>prayer.</hi> This is a duty in all caſes, but in none more than the preſent. If left to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, your own wiſdom and ſtrength, you will be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004912_0031_100E1977086648A8"/>
for your own ſecurity; perpetually in danger from your <hi>imaginations,</hi> as well as the other enemies of your <hi>ſouls.</hi> You can't be too ſenſible of this; nor can you, from a ſenſe of it, apply with too much importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the FATHER <hi>of mercies,</hi> to take pity upon you, and ſend you ſuch a ſupply of grace as is needful for you. You muſt not indeed think, that your duty lies in the buſineſs of prayer, and nothing elſe. You muſt uſe your own endeavours, neglect nothing that may prove a guard to you: But together with the uſe of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means, you muſt make known your requeſt to GOD by prayer and ſupplication. You muſt daily commit the keeping of your ſoul to him; and this you muſt particularly be careful to do in times of more ſpecial hazard; humbly hoping in GOD to be your help: And if he ſhall pleaſe to undertake for you, no deluſion ſhall ever have power over you, to ſeduce you; but, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a ſound mind, you ſhall go on in the uniform, ſteady ſervice of your maker and generation, till of the mercy of GOD, thro' the merits of the REDEEMER, you are crowned with eternal life.</p>
            <p>But I ſhall now draw towards a cloſe, by making ſome ſuitable <hi>application</hi> of what has been ſaid, And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us beware of charging GOD <hi>fooliſhly,</hi> from what we have heard of the <hi>nature,</hi> and <hi>influence</hi> of <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm.</hi> This may appear a dark article in GOD's government of the world; but it ſtands upon the ſame foot with his permiſſion of other evils, whether <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral.</hi> And, if we ſhou'd not be able to ſee perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the reaſon of this diſpenſation, we ſhou'd ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attribute it to our own ignorance, than reply a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt GOD. We may aſſure ourſelves, a wiſe, and good, and holy GOD, would not have ſuffered it thus to be, if there were not ſome great and valuable ends to be hereby anſwered.</p>
            <p>Greater advantages may, in the end, accrue to true religion, by the ſufferance of an <hi>enthuſiaſtic</hi> ſpirit, and the prevalence of it, at certain times, than we may be capable of diſcerning at preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:004912_0032_100E194AD95F0E60"/>It may furniſh both opportunity and occaſion for the trial of thoſe, who call themſelves chriſtians; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they have juſt notions of religion, and courage and faithfulneſs to ſtand up for <hi>real</hi> truths, againſt meer <hi>imaginary</hi> ones.—It may ſerve as a foil to ſet off the beauty and glory of true, genuine chriſtianity.—It may tend to the encouragement of reaſonable and ſolid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and, in the run of things, recommend it, in the moſt effectual manner, to men's choice and practice.— In a word, It may put men upon a more thorough ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination into the grounds of the chriſtian religion, and be the means of their being, more generally, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in its truth, upon the beſt and moſt reaſonable evidence.</p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the ends capable of being anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the permiſſion of a <hi>ſpirit of enthuſiaſm,</hi> and the prevalence of it, for a while. And as to the perſons themſelves led aſide by it, it is, in the ſame way to be reconcil'd with the general goodneſs of GOD towards men, as in the caſe of <hi>diſtraction,</hi> and the evil ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects conſequent theruepon. The perſons, heated with <hi>enthuſiaſtic</hi> imaginations, are either, in a faulty ſenſe, acceſſary to this unhappy turn of mind, or they are not: If the <hi>latter,</hi> they may depend upon the pity and mercy of GOD, notwithſtanding the extravagancies they may run into; yea, if they are good men, as is, doubtleſs, ſometimes the caſe, it may be hoped, that this evil which has happened to them, will, after the manner of other ſufferings, work together for good to them: But if thro' the pride of their hearts, a vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious temper, accompanied with raſhneſs and arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance, or the like, they are really acceſſary to their own deluſion, and mad conduct following therefrom, let them not think to caſt the blame on GOD: They do but reap the fruit of what they themſelves have ſown. And if they ſhou'd be totally delivered up, as has ſometimes been the caſe, to the devices of their own hearts, and the <hi>lying inſpirations</hi> of <hi>wicked ſpirits,</hi> they can fault no body but themſelves. GOD is juſt while he makes them an example for the warning of others, leſt they alſo be given up to believe lies. And he is <hi>good</hi> as well as juſt; good to others, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them hereby upon their guard, tho' he is ſevere towards <hi>them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:004912_0033_100E1978E87ACB00"/>2. Let none, from what has been offered, entertain prejudices in their minds againſt the <hi>operations</hi> of the SPIRIT. There is ſuch a thing as his influence upon the hearts of men. No conſiſtent ſenſe can be put upon a great part of the <hi>bible,</hi> unleſs this be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged for a truth: Nor is it any objection againſt its being ſo, that there has been a great deal of <hi>enthuſiaſm</hi> in the world, many who have miſtaken the motions of their own paſſions for divine operations. This, it muſt be acknowledged, ſhou'd make us cautious; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us upon a careful examination of whatever offers itſelf, as a communication from the SPIRIT, that we deceive not ourſelves: But its no argument, why we ſhou'd conceive a ſlighty tho't, either of the SPIRIT, or his influences, really made upon the minds of men. Much leſs is it a juſt ground of exception againſt the SPIRIT's <hi>operations,</hi> that they may be counterfeited; that men may make an appearance, as if they were acted by the SPIRIT, when, all the while, they have no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther view in their pretences, but to ſerve themſelves. This has often been the caſe; and points it out as a matter of neceſſity, that we take heed to ourſelves, if we would not be impos'd upon by a <hi>fair ſhew,</hi> and <hi>good words:</hi> But at the ſame time, 'tis no reaſon, why we ſhou'd think the worſe of the bleſſed SPIRIT, or of thoſe influences that are really <hi>his.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us be upon our guard as to this matter. Many, from what they have ſeen or heard of the ſtrange con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of men, pretending to be under <hi>divine impreſſions,</hi> have had their minds inſenſibly leaven'd with prejudices againſt the things of the SPIRIT. O let it be our care, that we be not thus wro't upon! And the rather, leaſt it ſhou'd prove the ruin of our ſouls. This, perhaps, we may not be afraid of: But the danger is great, if we take up wrong notions of the SPIRIT, or encourage an unbecomming tho't of his influences in the buſineſs of ſalvation, leaſt we ſhou'd grieve the <hi>good</hi> SPI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIT, and he ſhou'd leave us to periſh in a ſtate of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lianation from GOD, and true holineſs.</p>
            <p>'Tis worthy our particular remark, it is by the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful operation of the holy SPIRIT on the hearts of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004912_0034_100E194D659FE5A0"/>
men, that they are chang'd from the love and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſin, to the love and practice of holineſs; and have thoſe tempers form'd in them, whereby they are made meet for the glory to be hereafter revealed: Nor can this be done, in any way, without the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial influence</hi> of the bleſſed SPIRIT.</p>
            <p>And is it likely, <hi>He</hi> ſhou'd be preſent with men to ſuch gracious purpoſes, if they ſuffer their minds to be impreſſed with contemptuous tho'ts of him? If they begin to call in queſtion his <hi>office,</hi> as the <hi>great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſer of divine grace,</hi> or look upon his operations as all deluſion and imagination.</p>
            <p>We muſt have upon our minds a juſt tho't of the good SPIRIT, and of his <hi>influences.</hi> This is a matter of neceſſity. O let us encourage a ſteady faith in him, as that glorious perſon, by whom, and by whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, we can be prepared in this world, for happineſs in the world that is come. And let nothing, no wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of enthuſiaſm, ever be alſo to tempt us to call this in queſtion. And let us ſo believe in the HOLY GHOST, as to put ourſelves under his guidance; and let our dependance be on him for grace to help us in every time of need.</p>
            <p>Only let us look to it, that we take no <hi>impreſſions</hi> for his but ſuch as really are ſo: And let us not be ſatisfied, 'till we experience within ourſelves the <hi>real effects</hi> of the SPIRIT's operations; ſuch as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all that are in CHRIST JESUS; and always have been, and always will be, accompanied with a <hi>holy frame of ſoul,</hi> and a <hi>converſation becoming the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Let not any think <hi>ill</hi> of religion, becauſe of the <hi>ill</hi> repreſentation that is made of it by <hi>enthuſiaſts.</hi> There may be danger of this; eſpecially, in regard of thoſe who have not upon their minds a ſerious ſenſe of GOD and the things of another world. They may be ready to judge of religion from the <hi>copy</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them of it, by thoſe who are too much led by their fancies; and to condemn it, in the groſs, as a
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004912_0035_100E197A8268D628"/>
wild, imaginary, inconſiſtent thing. But this is to judge too haſtily and raſhly. Religion ought not to ſuffer in the opinion of any, becauſe of the imprudencies or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies of thoſe, who call themſelves the friends of it. Any thing may be abuſed: Nor is there any thing but has actually been abuſed. And why ſhou'd any think the worſe of religion, becauſe ſome who make more than ordinary pretences to it, ſet it forth in an ugly light by their conduct relative to it?</p>
            <p>There is ſuch a thing as real religion, let the conduct of men be what it will; and 'tis, in it's nature, a ſober, calm, reaſonable thing: Nor is it an objection of any weight againſt the ſobriety or reaſonableneſs of it, that there have been <hi>enthuſiaſts,</hi> who have acted as tho' it was a wild, imaginary buſineſs. We ſhould not make our eſtimate of religion as exhibited in the behaviour of men of a <hi>fanciful</hi> mind; to be ſure, we ſhould not take up an ill opinion of it, becauſe in the example they give of it, it don't appear ſo amiable as we might expect. This is unfair. We ſhou'd rather judge of it from the conduct of men of a <hi>ſound judgment</hi>; whoſe lives have been ſuch a uniform, beautiful tranſcript of that which is juſt and good, that we can't but think well of religion, as diſplay'd in their example.</p>
            <p>But however religion may appear as viewed in the lives, even of the beſt men, 'tis a lovely thing, as requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by GOD, and pourtrayed in the bible. We ſhou'd take our ſentiments of it from this <hi>book of</hi> GOD; and this, in the calm and ſober exerciſe of our underſtandings: And if we view it, as 'tis here delineated, we can't but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of it, the <hi>doctrines</hi> it teaches, and the <hi>duties</hi> it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, whether they relate to GOD, our ſelves, or our neighbour; they are all ſo reaſonable in themſelves, and worthy of the GOD, the ſtamp of whoſe authority they bear.</p>
            <p>Let us fetch our notions of religion from the ſcripture: And if men, in their practice, ſet it in a diſadvantageous light, let us be upon our guard, that we don't take up prejudices againſt it. This will blind our eyes, and may, by degrees, prepare the way to our throwing off all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004912_0036_100E194FCAFD33B0"/>
about religion; yea, we may be bro't to treat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with contempt; than which, nothing can be more dangerous, or put our ſalvation to a greater riſque.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Let us eſteem thoſe as <hi>friends</hi> to religion, and not <hi>enemies,</hi> who warn us of the danger of <hi>enthuſiaſm,</hi> and would put us upon our guard, that we be not led aſide by it. As the times are, they run the hazard of being call'd <hi>enemies</hi> to the <hi>holy</hi> SPIRIT, and may expect to be ill-ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of by many, and loaded with names of reproach: But they are notwithſtanding the beſt friends to religion; and it may be, it will more and more appear, that they have all along been ſo. They have been ſtigmatiſed as OPPOSERS of the WORK OF GOD; but 'tis a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of GOD, there have been ſuch OPPOSERS: This land had, in all probability, been over-run with confuſion and diſtraction, if they had acted under the influence of the ſame <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>zeal,</hi> which ſome others have been famous for.</p>
            <p>'Tis really beſt, people ſhou'd know there is ſuch a thing as <hi>enthuſiaſm,</hi> and that it has been, in all ages, one of the moſt dangerous enemies to the church of GOD, and has done a world of miſchief: And 'tis a kindneſs to them to be warn'd againſt it, and directed to the proper me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to be preſerved from it. 'Tis indeed, one of the beſt ways of doing ſervice to <hi>real</hi> religion, to diſtinguiſh it from that which is <hi>imaginary</hi>: Nor ſhou'd miniſters be diſcouraged from endeavouring this, tho' they ſhou'd be ill-tho't, or evil-ſpoken of. They ſhou'd beware of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much under the influence of that <hi>fear of man, which bringeth a ſnare</hi>; which is evidently the caſe, where they are either ſilent, or dare not ſpeak out faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and plainly, leſt they ſhou'd be called PHARISEES or HYPOCRITES, and charged with LEADING SOULS TO THE DEVIL. 'Tis a <hi>ſmall matter</hi> to be thus <hi>judged</hi> and <hi>reviled</hi>; and we ſhou'd be above being affrighted from duty by this, which is nothing more than the <hi>breath</hi> of poor, ignorant, frail man.</p>
            <p>There is, I doubt not, a great deal of <hi>real, ſubſtantial</hi> religion in the land. The SPIRIT of GOD has wro't ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually on the hearts of many, from one time to another:
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004912_0037_100E197DDD91E2A0"/>
And I make no queſtion he has done ſo of late, in more numerous inſtances, it may be, than uſual. But this, notwithſtanding, there is, without diſpute, a <hi>ſpirit of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm,</hi> appearing in one place and another. There are thoſe, who make great pretences to the SPIRIT, who are carried away with their imaginations: And ſome, it may be, take themſelves to be <hi>immediately and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conducted by him</hi>; while they are led only by their own fancies.</p>
            <p>Thus it has been in other parts of the world. <hi>Enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm,</hi> in all the <hi>wildneſs,</hi> and <hi>fury,</hi> and <hi>extravagance</hi> of it, has been among them, and ſometimes had a moſt dreadfully extenſive ſpread. <hi>Ten thouſand</hi> wild <hi>enthuſiaſts</hi> have appear'd in arms, at the ſame time; and this too, in defence of <hi>groſs opinions,</hi> as well as <hi>enormous actions.</hi> The firſt diſcovery therefore of ſuch a ſpirit, unleſs due care is taken to give check to its growth and progreſs, is much to be feared; for there is no knowing, how high it may riſe, nor what it may end in.—</p>
            <p>The good LORD give us all wiſdom; and courage, and conduct, in ſuch a Day as this! And may both <hi>miniſters</hi> and <hi>people</hi> behave after ſuch a manner, as that religion may not ſuffer; but in the end, gain advantage, and be ſtill more univerſally eſtabliſhed.</p>
