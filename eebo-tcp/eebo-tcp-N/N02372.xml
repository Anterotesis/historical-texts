            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I Having Opportunity, by dwelling in <hi>Hempſted</hi> ſeveral Years before ſhe departed this Life, had an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Acquaintance with her; and as the Lord had given her a Meaſure of his holy Spirit, to guide, lead and direct her in the Way of Peace, He alſo gave her a large Talent in a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Teſtimony, in which ſhe was very ſerviceable in our Meetings; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attended with Power, Wiſdom, and true Zeal; ſo that her Teſtimony was ſound and ſavoury, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting of the Upright hearted; ſhe being many Times drawn forth to encourage the exerciſed and afflicted in Spirit, and led to declare that the Way to the Kingdom of God is thro' Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations. And alſo would frequently preſs Friends to Upright-heartedneſs, Sincerity and Integrity; ſhe being alſo a good Example in her Converſation. And altho' the Lord had given her a

            <p>IT is in my Mind to write ſomething as a Teſtimony concerning my dear and well-beloved Friend <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Stirredge,</hi> deceaſed.</p>
            <p>She was one who received the Truth in the Love of it in her young Years, as I have heard from her own Mouth, and as in her following Book is more fully related: Wherefore I need ſay no more of that, but deſcend to write ſomething concerning her, during the Time of my Acquaintance with her, which was about Fifteen Years.</p>
            <p>She lived for that Time about Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Miles from us, and ſometimes would come to viſit our Meeting at <hi>Watford,</hi> whom I and many more were glad to ſee, ſhe being one whom the Lord was pleaſed to beſtow a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and Gift of the Miniſtry upon (which he is pleaſed to give unto both Male and Female, they being all one

               </gap>s Praiſe. And indeed her Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was reaching and affecting; my Heart hath been well affected many Times in Meetings with her Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; for ſhe ſpoke as one having Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, almoſt to Admiration, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Weakneſs of Body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withal ſhe was pretty much afflicted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the Lord was with her, who gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth Strength to the Weak, and his Power was her Support.</p>
            <p>It was her Lot, many Times, when ſhe came to our Meeting, to lodge at my Houſe, (my dear Mother <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah Neale</hi> and ſhe being very intimate Friends, and heartily loving each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Company) and indeed her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany I alſo loved, for it was pleaſant and delightful to the honeſt-hearted; and I may ſay, her Diſcourſe was edifying to me.</p>

               <pb facs="unknown:002815_0015_0FE642EC757B3D08"/>
And I have been affected to hear her give an Account of the Sufferings, deep Trial and Exerciſes of Friends, which ſhe, and many others went thro' in early Days; how when they were going to a Meeting, they went as it were, in Peril of their Lives, by reaſon of wicked and ungodly People throwing Stones, Clods, and other Things at them. And altho' many were they that roſe up againſt them, yet how wonderfully did the Lord preſerve his People in that Day, thro' many Tribulations! many of which various Exerciſes and Trials that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of our worthy Antients paſſed thro', bleſſed be the Lord, we in this our Day, are freed rom.</p>
            <p>Much might be ſaid concerning this our Friend; but in ſhort, ſhe was a valiant Woman for Truth on Earth, a Mother in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and a worthy faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Elder in the Church of Chriſt in her Time.</p>
            <p>And now my Deſire is, that we who are of a younger Generation, and are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

after a very ſtrict Manner, ſo that I can truly ſay, I was much a Strang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er unto the World, and its Ways.

Surely if it were poſſible for me to have enjoyed all the World, I could freely have parted with it, for Peace, Comfort and Satisfaction for my poor diſtreſſed Soul, that mourned as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Hope; and many a time, and many Hours have I been alone, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And under this exerciſe I grew very ſad, inſomuch that my Mother feared
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:002815_0023_0FE642F62D6DAB50"/>
I was going into a Conſumption, and greatly fear'd my Death; and would ſay to me, <hi>Canſt thou take Delight in nothing? I would have thee walk forth into the F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Then I fell into a Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of reading the Scriptures, and to be alone in private, reading, and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe I knew not that Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Power and Spirit to have Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion in me, that was in them that gave forth the Scriptures; and nothing elſe but the Subſtance would give me true Satisfaction, therefore the Scripture was but a Book ſealed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</p>
            <p>Then did I fall down upon my Knees, to pray unto the Lord, with my Heart full of Sorrow, and the Tears running down my Face, and could not utter one Word; which
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002815_0024_0FE64361645D3828"/>
ſeem'd very ſtrange unto me, and ſet me a thinking, that there was none like unto me. But it was the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my's Work to perſwade me, there was none like unto me: And becauſe I could not pray in Words, as others could, and likewiſe under Afflictions, therefore the Lord had no Regard un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me. But the Enemy is a Lyar, as ever, for the Lord was near me in every Exerciſe, and broke my Heart, and melted my Spirit, or elſe it would not have been ſo with me. Oh! my Soul can now behold his Goodneſs, for he was near me, altho' I was not aware of it; for I thought none was ſo miſerable as I, the Enemy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to caſt me down to make me deſpair. And truly it was the great Mercy of the Lord in preſerving me from it, for my Affliction was great, and my Diſtreſſes very many, and the Enemy following me with his Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and for Want of right Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation where my Strength was to be found; which was to have ſtood ſtill, and have waited upon the living God

               </gap> Enemy. And inſtead of ſo doing, the Enemy ſo diſturbed me, and ſo fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd me with his ſubtil Allurements, ſometimes to draw my Mind into the Vanities of this World, and to delight my ſelf in bedecking my ſelf in fine Clothes, that I might appear comely in the Eyes of the World; for (ſaid the Enemy) as for this Way of Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Trouble that thou art under, it will redound to no Advantage, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, nor Comfort; thou will not be in any Eſteem amongſt thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, therefore take thy Pleaſure, and be at reſt. A Lyar he is, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was from the Beginning; and my dear Children, believe him not, if it be your Lots to be under Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Exerciſe of any kind; or what Way ſoever the Lord may be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to lead you in, for the Trial of your Faith and Patience in any! kind; either now, or any Time of your Pilgrimage in this Life. I ſay, the Enemy will befool as many as he can; therefore look unto the Lord,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002815_0026_0FE64361671055F0"/>
and keep him in your Remembrance, and pray unto him in the inward of your Minds. Altho' you cannot utter one Word, know it aſſuredly, that he is near to help his afflicted Children at all Times, as they ſtand in Need or him. Oh! that I had known this in the Days of my Ignorance, and in my young and tender Years, when the Lord was near me, and at Work in my Heart, and I knew it not: For Want of an Underſtanding, the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my befooled me, and led me aſide in thoſe Things above-named and by hearkning unto him, and the young People that was my Neighbours, in perſwading me, that it would be of great Benefit to me, for I was young, and knew not what I might come to and I was left of my tender Father, and hardly any Friend was left me. And in my Diſtreſs and Afflictions, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have a little Reſt and Comfort, I lent out an Ear to the Enemy of my Soul, and let my Mind go forth after fine Clothes; but when it was drawn out, it went without Limit; and when

               </gap>s I could, it would hardly give me Content; for when I had one new thing, when I ſaw another, or the third, I was as deſirous as for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; ſo ever unſatisfied. Oh! the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Enemy, who promis'd me Reſt and Peace, but could not give it me; a Lyar he is, and ever was; my Soul hates him, and is at Enmity with him; the Lord preſerve me out of his Snares, and my Houſe alſo for ever.</p>
            <p>But tho' he had drawn out my Mind, the Lord did not leave me; for I ſhould many Times have a Concern upon my Mind what would become of me; and if at any Time I was drawn out into any Mirth or Laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhould feel ſomething ſmite my Heart, and bring great Heavineſs over my Spirit; but I knew not what it was, and I little thought it was the Lord, who was ever good and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, kind, merciful, and ſlow to Anger, and not willing People ſhould run into Deſtruction, nor periſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:002815_0028_0FE64364451D0D30"/>
I little thought he looked ſo nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly to my Ways; but ſince the Lord hath been pleaſed to open my Eyes, I can look back and admire his Goodneſs, and bleſſed be his worthy Name, and the right Arm of his Strength, who hath early been my Guide, and kept me in great Part from running into the Evil of the World, which greatly attends young People. But bleſſed be the Name of the Lord, he took me by the Hand, and led me when I knew not of it, in the Days of my tender Years; and if I had not hearkened unto the Enemy, my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition had been well. But as ſoon as he had drawn my Mind into Pride, and to take Delight in fine Clothes, it ſoon became my Burden; for in a little Time after, the Lord in the Riches of his Love, was pleaſed to fit and furniſh his Faithful Servants, and painful Labourers, whoſe Induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Lord greatly proſpered, two Men of worthy Memory, dear <hi>John Audland,</hi> and <hi>John Camm,</hi> in 1654. But when I heard the Report of them,

it ſtruck a Dread over my Heart, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their Plainneſs. I began to think, how ſhall I demean my ſelf to go to hear them. In a little Time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, there was a Meeting appointed by them; where my Lot was to be, and dear <hi>John Audland</hi> was declaring; but aſſoon as I heard his Voice, it pierced me; and when I came into the Meeting, and heard his Teſtimony, and beheld his ſolid Countenance, Oh! how my Heart was troubled within me, inſomuch that I knew not what would become of me.</p>
            <p>After Meeting was over, I ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelf from my Company, and travelled alone two Miles, becauſe no Ear ſhould hear me making my Moan unto the Lord; and out of the Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of my Spirit did I ſay, <hi>Lord, what ſhall I do to be ſaved? I would do any thing for Aſſurance of everlaſting Life; and if the Lord will be pleaſed to accept of me upon any Terms, I mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not what become of this outward Body, if I could find out a Cave of the Earth that I might get into, where I

might mourn out my Days in Sorrow, and ſee Man no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I thought I could have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; but it pleaſed the Lord to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Eyes of my Underſtanding, and to lead me by a Way that I knew not, and to begin the firſt Day's Work in my Heart, <hi>which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>It would be too tedious to go thro' every particular State; but my ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Cries were unto the Lord, to lead me the right Way, and <hi>to create in me a new Heart, and renew a right Spirit within me.</hi> Oh! let me be unto thee, O Lord, what I am, and not unto Man; and I do not take Care for this outward Body, do but redeem my Soul from Death, and out of this hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Oh! my Soul can do no leſs than magnifie the Living God, who is worthy of Praiſe, Honour and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, Thankſgiving and Obedience for evermore. And why ſo? becauſe he hath condeſcended unto the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Eſtate of his Hand-maid, and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Ear unto my Prayers, and had a Regard unto my Cries, and hath anſwered my Requeſt, and given me my Heart's Deſire, which was to be led the right Way. And <hi>Sion'</hi>s poor Travellers know very well this is a Beginning or a Step in the Way; for
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002815_0032_0FE6436FCBE8EB70"/>
I can truly ſay, that I never coveted Heaven's Glory, nor to be made a Partaker of the Riches, Glory, and everlaſting Well-being for ever, more than I deſired to walk in the Way that leads thereunto. And I did as truly believe that the Lord would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem a People out of the World, and its Ways, and Cuſtoms, Language, Marriage and Burying, and all the World's Hypocriſy; I looked for this Change, before I ſaw any Appearance of it; but all my Fear was, I ſhould not live to ſee it; the Enemy always following of me with his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to work me into Unbelief, and to caſt me down into Deſparation. Oh my Soul cannot but give the Lord God the Glory, the Honour and the Renown, for he is worthy of it for ever, and evermore.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear Children, this is for you to remember, and keep by you, that ye may always know the Way to Heaven's Glory, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy true Peace and Satisfaction: It is a ſtrait and narrow Way; whoever

And more eſpecially, <hi>keep your Heart with all Diligence; for out of it are the Iſſues of Life;</hi> then will you be brought nearer and nearer unto the Lord, and grow into Acquaintance with him; which was That my Soul mourned for in the Days of my ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Years; which I cannot forget, nor I hope ever ſhall; for I find the good Effects of it from Day, unto Day, it bows my Spirit, and humbles my Heart, and keeps me in a living Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of what the Lord has done for me; tho' the Lord hath been pleas'd to give me the Waters of a bitter Cup to drink, and to feed me with Bread of Affliction, and ſuffer Temptation upon Temptation to come near me; and the Enemy, the ſubtil Serpent, the old Dragon, who was more ſubtil than all the Beaſts of the Field, following me with his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Then would I wander alone in ſome remote Place, where no Eye could ſee me, nor Ear hear me, to make my moan unto the Lord, who hath ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comforted me, and refreſhed my Spirit many a time, and hath kept my Head above the Waters, bleſſed be the worthy Name of the Lord my God, and the right Arm of his ſtrength, that hath wrought wonderfully for my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; and curſed is the old Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, who ever envied Man's Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to deſtroy the bleſſed work of the Lord, as much as in him li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Oh! let me never forget ſo great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deliverance, but for ever keep in that, that will bow my Heart from Day unto Day, and humble my Spirit before the Lord, who hath been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to do more for me than my Tongue is able to declare. And altho' I can ſay, mine Eyes have ſeen Afflictions, and no Affliction ſeems joyous, but grievous for the preſent, yet after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it brings forth the peaceable Fruits of Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And now, my dear Children, my very Aim and End is to make you a little acquainted with the work of the Lord in my Heart, and alſo with the ſubtle Devices and Contrivances of the Enemy of your Immortal Souls; his way is to ſet his Baits according unto People's Nature, for therein he is moſt likely to prevail. And becauſe I was of a ſad Heart, and very ſubject to be caſt down; therefore did he with all his might endeavour to caſt me down into Deſpair, and Unbelief; perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:002815_0036_0FE6437569DD1A20"/>
of me I ſhould never hold out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the End. Then ſhould I mourn to the Lord, to preſerve me to the End, for my Affliction was very great, both inward and outward, and many things he caſt before me, that ſeem'd too hard for me to go thro'; when my Mind was filled with Sorrow, the Enemy got Ground upon me, and fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my Heart with Thoughts and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aginations, until my Heart grew hard before I was aware of it, and I had loſt that ſweet Enjoyment and Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fellowſhip that I was comforted with in the Night Seaſon, and in the Morning Light. I had great Cauſe to Magnifie the worthy Name of the Lord, who was pleaſed to comfort my afflicted Soul; but when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my had gotten a little Ground upon me, he ſet his Baits ſo agreeable unto my Nature, which was apt to be caſt down. And when I had any thing ſtruggling in me in remembrance of my State and Condition I was in a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before, and now for a little time I had loſt it; I had great cauſe to mourn

unto the Lord, who was able to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me, as he had done many a time, bleſſed be his Holy Name, and the Right Arm of his Strength, that lives for ever. Yet tho' he was able to do it, yet the Enemy prevail'd upon me a little further: For when I was in my mournful Eſtate, making my Moan unto the Lord, ſaying in my Heart, <hi>There's no Sorrow like mine; and why none like thine? Becauſe I had loſt my Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and my Loſs was great; he that had redeemed my Soul from Death, and had done well for me.</hi> Oh!

               </gap> that ſubtil Serpent, who was too hardfor me, in perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me I was diſcontented, a Murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and a Complainer, and I made the Lord weary with my crying, and ſhould be ſhut out of his Kingdom, for 'twas the Murmurers and Complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that periſhed in the Wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>Oh! how ſoon was I caught by his Subtilty; for he infuſed in me, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded

me it was in vain to ſtrive any longer, for I ſhould never Inherit the Kingdom of Heaven. But a Lyar he was, and ever will be, my Soul is at Enmity with him; the Lord whom I truſt, preſerve me, and my Houſe for ever, as it pleaſed my Heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (who had a regard unto me) to make way for me to eſcape. For in a little time after, it was my lot to be at a Meeting, where a Faithful Servant of the Lord was, by Name <hi>William Dewsbery,</hi> whoſe Teſtimony was moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unto the diſtreſſed and afflicted, toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Tempeſt, and not comforted;<note place="margin">1655.</note> which State many were in, in that Day. A true Meſſenger he was unto many. I was 21 Years of Age when I was in this Condition; but after Meeting was ended, I dreaded to go unto him, for I thought that he was one of a great diſcerning, and he would be ſenſible the Hardneſs of my Heart; and if he ſhould Judge me, I ſhould not be able to bear it; but yet I could not go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in Peace, until I had been with

            </p>
            <p>Oh! he was one that had good Tidings for me in that Day, and great Power was with his Teſtimony at that very Time; for the Hardneſs was taken away, and my Heart was open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that Ancient Power that opened the Heart of <hi>Lydia;</hi> everlaſting Praiſes be given unto him that ſits upon the Throne for ever, who hath preſerved me out of the Snares and ſubtil Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances of the Adverſary.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>This is unto thee, O King, hear what the Lord hath committed unto my Charge concerning thee.

But it pleaſed the Lord to appear in a needful hour, and turned back the Enemy of my Soul's Peace, and ſhewed unto me that he would chooſe the weak and the dejected, and them that were nothing in their own Eyes, and that could do nothing, no not ſo much as to utter a word but what the Lord giveth into their Mouths, I mean in Teſtimony for the living God, that the Scripture of Truth may be fulfilled in this our Day, as fully as it was in Times paſt and gone, that <hi>no Fleſh ſhould glory in his Preſence.</hi> Then did I freely give up to obey the Requirings of the Lord with Peace and Comfort, and received the bleſſed Reward in my Boſom, as I have already ſaid; but our Exerciſe continued by our Perſecutors.

for the Rulers have made ſuch Laws, that never was the like in any Age.</hi> I ſaid, John, <hi>When thou haſt wronged thy Conſcience, and brought a Burthen upon thy Spirit, it is not the Rulers can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move it from thee.

            </p>
            <p>But the Officer that were with him, came and pulled down our Goods; but the Power of the Lord ſmote them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that Paleneſs was in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and their Lips quivered, and their Hands did ſo ſhake, that they could not hold it long. Then they would force a Poor Man to take them, but he refuſed, until they forced him, and laid them upon his Arms and Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; but he looking much like a dead Man, replied, <hi>You force me to do that, which you cannot do your ſelves, neither can I;</hi> for he trembled very much, tho' we had not ought farther to ſay unto them, after they came in, but could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that the Lord had found us wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

to Suffer for his bleſſed Truth and Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>A little time after they had a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Prize the Goods they took from us, and other <hi>Friends;</hi> where there met together Seven Men called Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, and the Officers and Sheriffs, and many more of their Confederates, a great Room full of them; and I was at Work in our Shop; and ſeeing the Conſtable carrying along ſome of the Goods to be Prized, it immediately came into my Heart to go after them; not knowing one word that I ſhould have to ſay; which made me a little conſider for what I ſhould go; but it more and more reſted with me to go; and when I came within the Door, I ſate down like one that was a Fool, and had not one word to ſay for a time; as near as I can count the time, half or three Parts of an hour. But when I came in they were greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieted in their Minds, and hurried in their Buſineſs, that they ſaid many a time, <hi>that they could do nothing whilſt I was with them;</hi> the Juſtices calling one
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002815_0054_0FE64E9472E2FA40"/>
another to cauſe me to be taken away many times; ſaying, <hi>We ſhall not do any Buſineſs this Day, but ſpend our time in vain, if this Woman ſit here.</hi> And they many times tempted me to ſpeak what I had to ſay, and be gone; but could not prevail with me. Then cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Man of the Houſe to take me away, ſolemnly proteſting never to come to his Houſe again, if if he would not take me away. But the Man had not Power to touch me, but full of trouble, ſaid, <hi>Sir, I cannot lay Hands on her, for ſhe is my honeſt Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour:</hi> And turning towards me, ſaid, <hi>pray Neighbour</hi> Stirredge, <hi>if you have any thing to ſay, ſpeak, that you may be gone.</hi> Then one of the Juſtices in great Rage and Fury Solemnly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted he would never ſit with them any more, if they did not take me a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; oftentimes wondering at their Folly for letting of me alone. Then he opened a Back Door, and went out as tho' he would be gone but in a little time came in again, ſaying, <hi>What is ſhe here yet? I wonder at your Folly.</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:002815_0055_0FE64397D26DAE90"/>
Then the Power of the Lord fell upon me, and filled my Heart with a very dreadful Warning amongſt them; tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them, <hi>That it was in vain for them to be found ſtriving againſt the Lord, and his People; their Work would not proſper; for the great God of Heaven and Earth would be too ſtrong for them. Therefore I warned them to Repent, and amend their Lives before it be too late; for the Lord will ſmite you in a Day at unawares, and in an Hour not expected by you, therefore remember that the Lord hath afforded you a Day of Warning, before Deſtruction comes upon you.</hi> This, and much more ran thro' me at that time; and the Lord was pleaſed in a very ſhort time to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil that Teſtimony on them. For in a few Weeks, as they were making mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at a Feaſt, Two of them died on a ſudden, after Dinner, and the reſt very hardly eſcaped, about the Year, 1674.</p>
            <p>Now, my dear Children, I write not this, to rejoyce at the Fall of our Enemies; but for you to conſider of
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002815_0056_0FE64E96EE2F0368"/>
the Goodneſs, and Mercies, and Deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Lord with his People in all Ages; and to keep in Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance his loving Kindneſs and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance to the very wicked, that are always provoking him to pour down his Vengeance upon their Heads. Yet ſo great is his Mercies, that he always warneth the Wicked, and gives them Time to repent, and Space to amend their Lives, that the Lord may be clear in the Day of Account; which Day will ſurely come upon all that draws Breath in the Air.</p>
            <p>Therefore, my dear Children, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your latter End, and the Day of Account, and keep a Bridle to your Tongues; for he that knows not a Bridle to his Tongue, his Religion is vain. And keep to the daily Croſs, <hi>which is the Power of God to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And if you will be Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven and Crown Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, you muſt take up the daily Croſs, for <hi>no Croſs, no Crown;</hi> for the Croſs will keep your Minds in Subjection to the Living God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

in Subjection, and ſtanding in Awe that you ſin not, this will keep you near unto the Lord, in a living Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him; then he will take Delight to bleſs you more and more, to inſtruct you, and to counſel you in his Way; which is pure and holy, and will not admit of any Unholineſs, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> any Uncleanneſs.</p>
            <p>Therefore, my dear Children, keep clear in your Spirits in the Sight of God, and beware of the World, and the People thereof; be not in too much Familiarity with them, nor let in their Spirit to mix with yours; that hath been the Hurt of many that have been going right on their Way, and have made a good Beginning; yet for Want of Watchfulneſs, and keeping to the Guide of their Youth, the Light of Chriſt Jeſus, which is the Way to Salvation; and whoever comes in any other Way, is a Thief and a Robber. The Way you know, you have been trained up in it; and the Concern of my Spirit is, that you may keep in it, and be concern'd
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002815_0058_0FE64E9720BE5AD0"/>
for your Children, as your Father and I have been for you; and train them up in the Way of Truth, and keep them out of the beggerly Rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this World, that they may grow up in Plainneſs, and keep to the plain Language, both you and they; which is become a very indifferent Thing amongſt many of the Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of Truth. But in the Beginning we went thro' great Exerciſe for that very Word, as <hi>Thee</hi> or <hi>Thou</hi> to one particular Perſon. And for my Part, I had a Concern upon my Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſhifted many a Time from that one Word; I would have ſaid any Word rather than <hi>Thee</hi> or <hi>Thou,</hi> that would have anſwered the Matter that I was concern'd in, but ſtill I was condemned, Guilt following of me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I was not clear in the Sight of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Way was hedged up with Thorns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I could go no further, until I had yielded Obedience unto the little Things; then I walked alone (as my Manner was, and frequently uſed ſo to do, when Things came as a Weight

or Concern upon me) where I might be private from all Concern, except my Soul's Concern. Oh! that deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Place where I uſed to retire alone, how many Times hath my Soul met with my Beloved there, that hath ſweetly comforted me, when my Soul hath been ſick of Love; and full of Doubts for Fear my Beloved had left me, and forſaken me. But bleſſed be his Name, that liveth for ever, he ſtill appeared in a needful Time, when my Soul was diſtreſſed for him, and then was the Time I truly prized him. And this is the Way of the Lord's dealing with his Children, that he may teach them to be humble, and train them up as Children, that they may learn Obedience in all Things to do his Will. And this is his End in chaſtizing of his Children, to make them fit for his Service.</p>
            <p>But I little thought in that Day, the Lord would have ſpared me ſo many Years, to bear a faithful Teſtimony to his bleſſed Truth and Powerful Appearance in the Morning of the

            <p>But the greateſt Exerciſe that ever I met withal, was conerning this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating Spirit that is gone forth from us, that firſt began to appear in theſe Parts, in <hi>John Story,</hi> and <hi>John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon,</hi> about the Year, 1670. which I find a Concern upon my Spirit to leave a ſhort Relation of my great Travail and Exerciſes in this Work and Service for the Lord, his bleſſed Truth and Teſtimony, that he in the Riches of his Love had made my Heart and Soul a living Partaker of, Praiſes be given to his Holy Name for ever.</p>
            <p>In the Year 70. which was a Time of great Suffering amongſt Friends, and from that Time forward, as it is well known amongſt Friends and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, we went to our Meetings in the Peril of our Lives, and our Goods they took for a Prey.

And indeed there was too too many that the Lord had reached unto in the Days of the breaking forth of his wonderful Power, whom the Lord had enriched both inward, and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that had forgotten the Days of their Diſtreſs, and where th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And in that Day of great Trouble, greater was our Sorrow for the Loſt of our Brethren, than for all our Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, or Loſs of Goods, or all other Abuſes of what kind ſoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for indeed, great was our Sorrow on every Hand, and my Soul was moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned for the Lord, and his bleſſed Truth and Teſtimony.

God, whom I had made a Covenant with in the Days of my bitter Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailings, when my Soul lay in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and Horror; where the Lord firſt met with me, when I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailing my ſelf in bitter Lamentation, ſaying in my Heart, <hi>O that I could find out a Cave in the Earth, wherein I might go and mourn out my Days in Sorrow, and ſee Man no more; or that the Lord would be pleaſed to accept of me upon any Terms; or if my Life would be accepted of for a Ranſom for my Soul, I would be very willing to part with it.</hi> The Cry many a time ran thro' my Heart, <hi>O Lord, what ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Oh! the Appearance of the Lord in that State was very precious to me, I very gladly entred into Covenant with him, to ſerve him for ever, if he would redeem my Soul from Death, and from under the Power of him that was too ſtrong for me. And ſeeing the Lord in his Infinite Mercy was ſo good and gracious unto me, as to give me my Hearts Deſire, how

could I forget it? No, <hi>rather let my right Hand forget her Cunning, and my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth, before I ſhould forget to pay my Vows and Promiſes to the Lord, in the Days of my Diſtreſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now to come to the Matter concerning this Libertine Spirit.—In the aforeſaid Year 70. when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their Work, the Prieſt's Son of our Town was one of the <hi>Informers,</hi> and his Curate was another. The Prieſt's Son bought him a new Sword, and ſwore, he <hi>would bathe it in our Blood;</hi> and ſaid, <hi>It was no more Sin to kill a Quaker, than it was to kill a Louſe.</hi> Thus they began their dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Work, which is too tedious to run thro' the Particulars: But they firſt Nail'd up our Meeting-Houſe-Doors, and ſet a Guard before it; and it being on a Day that the Petty-Seſſions was kept in that Town of <hi>K<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

who came in great Rage with Clubs, and other Weapons, but the Lord was good and gracious unto us, and gave us Strength according to the Day, and opened my Mouth in a Teſtimony for the Encouragement of Friends, and in Praiſe to God, for counting us worthy to ſuffer for his Name and Truth's Sake. And after me, another Woman, to the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging of Friends; and the Power of the Lord was ſo livingly felt amongſt us, that our Enemies fell, that they could hardly ſpeak to ask us our Names. But at length we were Fined 20<hi>l.</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piece, but when Meeting ended, we came away rejoycing. And indeed there was great Cauſe for it; for the Power of God was over all, to o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But for all this, the Clouds gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Blackneſs, and Storms raiſed high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and higher, and diſmal Days ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; and many ſet their Wits at Work, and conſulted together how to meet in private, and out of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies Sight. And it was but a little
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:002815_0066_0FE64EA15EA415F0"/>
Time that our Meeting held toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; for one that had been a <hi>Great Preacher</hi> of our Meeting, was ſoon weary with ſtanding in the Street, at our Meeting-Houſe-Door, and was greatly offended with us, for not lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Meeting-Houſe, and come and meet with him in private in his Dwelling-Houſe. And there was a little Remnant that could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to the Will of Man, but feared the Lord, and dreaded to deny him before Men.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>R. W.</hi> who was <hi>John Story</hi>'s great Aſſociate, whilſt the ſaid <hi>J.

many were taken in the Snare. But when I heard this Meſſage deliver'd from the <hi>Wiſe Preacher</hi> afore-nam'd, Oh! the Concern that fell upon me, in Conſideration of them that had been <hi>Preachers</hi> amongſt us many Years, that ſhould have been a Strength to the Weak, and Encouragers of the People; and Legs to the Lame, and Eyes to the Blind; that ſuch Men ſhould have no more Courage, nor Zeal, nor Love to the Lord and his bleſſed Truth. Oh! it became my great Grief, and I ſorrowed Night and Day; Lord ſtrengthen thy weak ones, and make the little ones as ſtrong as <hi>David;</hi> give us Courage and Boldneſs to ſtand as faithful Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes for thy bleſſed Truth. And bleſſed for ever be the Lord our God, he anſwered my Requeſt, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Day, was our Strength renewed; bleſſed be that Hand that never failed us, nor any that put their Truſt in him.</p>
            <p>So they parted from us, and left us as it were in the open Field, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter

with our Enemies; who the more triumphed, and made a By-Word of them and us; and cried out, <hi>Here be the Fools, the wiſe Men are gone. Aye,</hi> ſay they, <hi>they have more Wit than to meet ſo near the Juſtices Houſe to aggravate him, and ruine themſelves; they be wiſe Men to ſave themſelves, and that they have; but theſe are the Fools, they will ruine themſelves do what we can; a poor Company of ignorant Fools, that know not their right Hand from their Left? Do you think to ſtand againſt all the Powers of the Earth? a Company of ſilly Fools!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus they pleaſed themſelves with ſuch Diſcourſes, thus to loſe Ground, which was a grievous Exerciſe to us, to hear any of our Brethren, which ſhould have been as Valiants in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and have gone before the little ones, like valiant Champions to have born the Brunt of the Battle; that our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies might have ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

might have been glorified, and his bleſſed Name and Truth honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exalted over all; who alone is worthy of all Honour and Praiſe for evermore.</p>
            <p>But if any ſhould ſay, <hi>Was this a Diſcouragement to you little ones?</hi> No, our Fear and Zeal towards God was increaſed; and I can ſay, to the Praiſe and Honour of his everlaſting Name, my Cries and Supplications did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend Night and Day unto the Lord, for Strength to ſtand in my Lot and Teſtimony, and that I might be made able to hold out to the End. And for ever bleſſed be the Lord, he ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened my Weakneſs, and made the Weak as ſtrong as <hi>David,</hi> and afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his living Preſence amongſt us, to our great Comfort. But ſtill my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe increaſed, which drove me to a narrow Search, and a deep and pondrous Conſideration what ſhould be the Cauſe of my great Exerciſe; crying to the Lord, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?

            <p>And another Time in great Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe it often ſounded in my Heart, <hi>I will gather from far, from the Eaſt, Weſt, North and South, and they ſhall come and ſit down in the Kingdom, with</hi> Abraham, Iſaac <hi>and</hi> Jacob, <hi>and the Children of the Kingdom ſhall be c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

from far, and bring near them that are afar off, but ſave the Children of the Kingdom.</hi> This Thing was my daily and hourly Exerciſe; many times ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within my ſelf, <hi>O Lord, ſave the Children of the Kingdom, or take me to thy ſelf, whilſt thy Mercy is continued unto me; let me not live to be caſt out of thy Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus the Lord gently led me in theſe Things, tending towards this Service and Teſtimony that he was pleaſed to lay upon me to bear; which was the very greateſt that ever I met withal. For ſtill my Exerciſe increaſed, my inward Pains grew ſtronger and ſtronger, my Heart was troubled within me, my Eyes were as a Fountain of Tears, and I cried out, <hi>Woe is me, that ever I was born. Oh; what is the Matter that all my Bowels ſeem to be diſplaced.</hi> Then the Word ran thro' my Heart, <hi>My Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is kindled, and my Anger is wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en hot againſt this People, and my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy ſhall be with them; and the Time is coming, that they will bring

But for ever magnified be the Name and Power of our God, his Preſence was our Life and Strength, and according to the Day, was Strength given<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="56" facs="unknown:002815_0073_0FE643AF90AEC080"/>
Whereof we had great Cauſe to ſay, <hi>Good is the Lord, and his Mercies en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure for ever.</hi> And we had Cauſe to praiſe his Name, for that he had made us worthy to ſuffer for his Name and Truth's Sake; and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of us faithful to ſtand for our God, and confeſs him before Men. For I can ſay to his Praiſe, I was more encouraged in all times of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, wherein I might bear my Teſtimony for the Lord, that had redeemed my Soul from Death, and raiſed me out of the Pit of Miſery, that I rejoyced to do the Will of the Lord; for it was more to me, than all that ever my Eyes beheld, and to ſtand a faithful Witneſs for him.</p>
            <p>I was conſtrain'd in the Fear and Dread of the Lord, to warn them of the dreadful Day of the Lord, and to call them to Repentance for their Unfaithfulneſs. Thus we went on in our continual Exerciſe, and in the Strength of the Lord, and by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of his Holy Power, were born up in it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:002815_0074_0FE64EA9AB8FDB00"/>
But now to come to what is moſt before me, that all may underſtand how the Enemy works in a Myſtery, and under a fair Pretence to betray the precious Life, and from the Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the Goſpel, which is Fooliſhneſs to the Wiſdom of the World.</p>
            <p>In this troubleſome Time, it came in my Heart to viſit Friends in <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> where I heard much of J. S. his Goings on. He had much reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon ſeveral Women for bearing their Teſtimony againſt that Spirit; and I met with two good Women that had been upon the Service of Truth, and had a good Teſtimony. He grieved them, bidding them go Home about their Buſineſs, and waſh their Diſhes, and not go about to preach. And ſaid, that <hi>Paul</hi> did ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely forbid Women to preach; and ſent them crying home. And furthermore, he counſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>led Friends to uſe Chriſtian Prudence, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what is ſaid in Scripture, <hi>If you are perſecuted in one City, flee to

another.</hi> So he would have them to alter the Day and Time of their uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Meeting. And there was a little Meeting in a Dwelling Houſe, and he importuned them to remove it, or alter the Time; and the Woman Friend of the Houſe was ſoon gained, not being ſo zealous for the Truth as ſhe ſhould have been. Her Husband being more faithful, would not be caught in that Snare. She fell at Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with him, and ſaid, <hi>Doſt thou think God doth not reveal his Secrets to ſuch as</hi> J. S. <hi>more than we? Yes ſurely, and if the Lord is pleaſed to ſave us, and what we have, and make him an Inſtrument, why ſhall not we receive his Counſel?</hi> A very ſubtil Bait to catch the poor ignorant People in. Oh, this was a great Grief to the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere-hearted! it cauſed many to know Days and Nights of Sorrow. But ſtill this Teſtimony always lived in my Heart, that God's Anger was kindled againſt that Spirit that had turned their Backs on Truth's Teſtimony; and was not only fallen

            <p>But there came a faithful Servant of the Lord to our Meeting, whoſe Name was <hi>Miles Halhead,</hi> who was wonderfully endowed with the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord, and great Diſcerning; he came to ſee me, and ſaid, <hi>My Love runs unto thee, and that for the Work's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

            <p>Oh! I cannot but greatly admire the infinite Mercies and Loving Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord, and his long For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance with me, in that he did not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ut me off in my Diſobedience to him,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:002815_0080_0FE64EB319013EC0"/>
when I knew what he required of me, as well as I knew my right Hand from my Left, and would not obey him. But ſtill I reaſoned, and cried out, <hi>What ſhall I do?</hi> And I thought that if any one had born a Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in publick before me, I could the better have born it; but I to be one of the firſt, ſuch a contemptible one as I, I thought I could not do it. But what Mercy did not do, Judgment did; for the Lord was pleaſed to lay his Hand heavy upon me, and with his Correcting Rod chaſtized me; and I did feel more of the Diſpleaſure of the Lord for my Backwardneſs to his Requirings, than ever I did for my former Tranſgreſſion. For I may ſay, as true as ever <hi>Jonah</hi> was plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into the Deep, and his Head wrapped about with Weeds, ſo was my Soul plunged into a Gulph of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery; inſomuch that all Hope of ever finding Favour with God again, was hid from me, and I left in Sorrow to lament, as one without Hope.</p>
            <p>Oh! how did my Heart lament,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:002815_0081_0FE643BF1B9CAA20"/>
and my Soul languiſh Night and Day; and I ſaid, <hi>O that the Lord would be pleaſed to ſhew Mercy once more, and to raiſe up my Life again, and redeem my Soul out of this horrible Pit wherein I am held as with Chains, and bring me to my former State again, and require what thou pleaſeſt, and I will obey thy Voice, tho' I ſhould be hated of all Men upon the Face of the Earth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And before I could take any Reſt, I made a deep Engagement unto the Lord, to do whatſoever he required of me, if he would give me Strength, and be with me. So when Firſt Day Morning came, I had a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern upon me; and when I ſate down to wait upon the Lord, the Power of the Lord ſeized on me, which made me to tremble; inſomuch that my Bones were ſhaken, and my Teeth chattered, and I was in a great Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and ſtanding up, with a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Teſtimony, and proclaiming God's Controverſy with the Exalted and High amongſt the Profeſſors of Truth, and ſuch as had departed from the

Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, with ſuch God's Anger was waxen hot, and his Indignation burned, and I warned them to repent while they had a Day, and more to that Effect, but as ſhort as I could. Then a Friend ſtood up with a great Concern upon him, ſaying, <hi>A living Teſtimony is the God of Heaven and Earth raiſing up amongſt the poor and contemptible ones, that ſhall ſtand over your Heads for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi> So he went on in great Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Authority, and the Power of the Lord was greatly manifeſted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us that Day. O Glory be to his Everlaſting Name for evermore, ſaith my Soul, for his bleſſed Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to us that Day, and all other of his Mercies at all Times, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned me an hundred-fold in my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, after all my unworthy conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting againſt the Motions of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſo merciful and compaſſionate a Father, who after he had corrected me, receiv'd me into Favour again: O Glory to him for evermore.

O the Peace and Comfort and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that I received from the Lord, was more to me than all the World, or the Friendſhip of it.</p>
            <p>So ſome time after, <hi>John Story</hi> and Three of his Party came to my Houſe to rebuke me, and was very high, and ſpoke great ſwelling Words, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby to diſcourage me. <hi>John Story</hi> asked me, <hi>What I had to lay to his Charge, and what I had againſt him, I told him, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

For the Lord was
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:002815_0086_0FE64EBA8AA8BAB0"/>
pleaſed to continue my Exerciſe in that City, where <hi>John Story</hi> abode much of his Time. And ſeveral more of that Spirit oftentimes frequented thither in that Time of Exerciſe with that Spirit. And the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to make me ſo ſenſible of them, that in the Night Seaſon I had many a ſore and hard Travail upon my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, when I knew not of any of them by any Information from any one. Then did I make my Moan unto the Lord, crying in ſecret; <hi>O what ſhall I do to go thro' ſuch hard Things? O that I may be excuſed this Day, or that thou wilt be pleaſed to keep me in Silence this Day; then ſhould I be very willing to go to Meeting to wait upon thee, and to ſit under the Shadow of thy Wing with great Delight, where thy Fruit will be pleaſant to my Taſte.</hi> Then it would come up before me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Covenant that I made with the Lord in the Days of my Diſtreſs, when all the World, and the Friend, ſhip of it, would not yield me one Dram of Comfort to my poor diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

Soul. Then did I promiſe the Lord in that Day, which was twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years before That, that if he would redeem my Soul from Death, and give me Aſſurance of Life, I would ſerve him all my Days, if he would give me Strength, and be with me; for I mattered not what I went thro' for his Name's Sake. And it would often come up before me, that they that followed the Lord, and loved him moſt, did whatſoever he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded them. Oh! I cannot but ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the long Forbearance and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Kindneſs of the Lord, that he had not cut me off in my Gainſaying, and Unfaithfulneſs; for I never want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Aſſiſtance of his Holy Spirit, in giving up to his Requirings, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Holy Name of our Lord God, and the right Arm of his Strength for evermore, who alone hath been our Keeper and Preſerver to this very Day, Glory be to his Great Name for evermore.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall give a little Account of one Meeting in <hi>Briſtol,</hi> which was
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:002815_0088_0FE64EBC427889B0"/>
one of the greateſt Exerciſes that ever I met with, or ever went thro' ſince I had a Remembrance. When I was going to the Meeting, I had a great Exerciſe upon my Spirit, and knew not for what; but after ſome Time of waiting upon the Lord, I ſaw my Service, for <hi>J. Story</hi> was there, who came into <hi>Briſtol</hi> the Night before; and ſeveral Friends had warned him <hi>not to come and offer his Gift, till he was reconciled unto his Brethren;</hi> for if he did, they did believe that the Lord would concern one or another to bear Teſtimony openly againſt him, But I knew not of it till afterward; for if I had, I believe my Service would not have been ſo hard and ſtrange unto me. But whilſt he was a declaring a great Cloud came over the Meeting, and I was greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in my Spirit; inſomuch that the Lord conſtrained me to cry, <hi>Woe to that Spirit that dimned the Glory of the Lord, and woe to that Pot that the Scum remains in it, for in it is the Broth of abominable Things, ſuch as the

               </gap> that I ſhould have withſtood the Spirit of the Lord in my own Conſcience. But I ſtrove againſt it, by Reaſoning, and ſaying, <hi>O that the Lord would be pleaſed to excuſe me this Day, and that I might not loſe his Favour, then I ſhould have accounted my ſelf happy.</hi> But all this Reaſoning would not do that Service that God had for me to do that Day. But when I found no way to paſs it by, I ſtood up to clear my Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and diſcharge my Duty in the Sight of God. And when I conſider'd the low Eſtate and weak Condition that I had been in that Day; O the Lord's Strength ſuſtained me, for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

            <p>And thus, Reader, I have given this ſhort Account of the going forth and Work of that Spirit; ſince which, I have ſeen a withering and Decay come upon it, near Twenty Years having ſince paſs'd over my Head.</p>
            <p>O the many unchriſtian-like Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that have been brought forth by that Spirit; and how have ſome of them writ and printed againſt Truth and its good Order, and how have they turned their Backs in the Day of Battle, and have left their Brethren in the Hands of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? O how grievous have their Actions been ſince the Year 70. Now let all conſider whether that Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that God raiſed in my Heart in that Time of my great Diſtreſs, and

great Bowings down, and bitter Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailings, when the Lord anſwered me, for what my great Exerciſe came upon me, was not true; for I can truly ſay, I went under the Exerciſe of their Backſliding many a time. And the Lord was pleaſed to exerciſe me, and to cauſe me to go thro' a Vail of Tears, and a Land of Drougth, in Order to humble me, and that I might bow to his Will, and obey him in all Things; <hi>for Obedience is better than Sacrifice, and to hearken to the Voice of the Lord, is better than the Fat of Rams.</hi> And there is no hearing of his gracious Voice, but by humbling under his mighty Power, and ſubjecting the Mind unto his Will; then d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:002815_0098_0FE64EC5231F0B08"/>
conſider it before it be too late, and before the Days of your Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty come upon you, and the Arrows of the Almighty ſlick faſt in your Livers, and there will be none to help you, nor to deliver out of his Hands; for the Lord will aſſuredly viſit this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that for the Treachery and curſed Oaths, Pride and Oppreſſion of many therein, whoſe Sins have reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto Heaven. And it is the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the great God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of Earth to ſend his deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel amongſt them, and ſhall thin them. Great will be your Sorrow, Pain, and Perplexity, Terror and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazement, Horror and Vexation of Spirit; alas, for the Day will be great, who ſhall be able to ſtand in it, but the pure in Heart, and them that have made the Lord</hi> Jehovah <hi>their Choice, and love him above all things, as well in Times of Peace, as Times of Diſtreſs, ſuch ſhall dwell with the Lord for ever.</hi>

that are Fathers of Children, O diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour not your grey Hairs ſo much, as that you ſhould be found nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſuch ungodly Actions. Oh! conſider your Places and wherefore the Lord created you; it was to ſerve him, and not to ſerve Sin, nor Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs. And wherefore did the Lord our God, who is rich in his Mercies, ordain Means or a Way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Men might eſcape the Snare, but that he would have all to do well, and live in his Favour for ever. Oh! be you all awakened this Day, and be you rouzed up, and ſleep not in Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; for Deſtruction is near if you do not ſpeedily repent. Oh conſider the</hi> Sodomites <hi>of Old, how they were toiling, and nothing would ſatisfy them but the Servants of the Moſt High God, that he had ſent to warn them; and inſtead of being warned by them, they the more provoked the Juſt and Holy God,</hi> who willeth not the Death of Sinners, but had rather they would return and live; <hi>and therefore hath he ſent his Servants
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:002815_0100_0FE64EFEF8CD1788"/>
early and late to warn the People; that by taking warning the might eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the Wrath of the moſt High God, that all are liable to fall into, that are adding Sin unto Sin. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I know nothing more likely to draw down the Vengeance of the dreadful and terrible God, than to cruelly uſe his Children, and to make them to groan under their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, as</hi> Pharaoh <hi>did in his Day; until their Groans pierced the Ears of the Lord, and he ſaid</hi> I have heard the Groanings of my People, and I am come down to deliver them. <hi>And truly our God is the ſame, as great in Power, and as mighty to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver at this Day, as he was in that Day. And truly if you do thus go on, as you have already done, your Days will be ſhorten'd, and you ſhall not proſper. Therefore conſider it in Time, I intreat you; as you tender the Good of your own Souls, and your Childrens, be not Patterns of Cruelty to ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generations; leave not your Names upon Record for ſuch ungodly Actions,

and unchriſtian-like Dealings, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting your honeſt Neighbours for keeping their Conſciences void Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence towards God, and all Men; for it is becauſe we fear the great God of Heaven and Earth that made us, and gave us our Breath and Being, and durſt not betray our Lord and Maſter, as</hi> Judas <hi>did in his Day: But mark what became of him.

their Faithfulneſs to the Lord, and his bleſſed Truth. He was greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, but againſt me in particular was he enraged greatly; to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that he ſaid, <hi>If he could but live to ſee me ruined, and my Husband for my Sake, he cared not if he died next Day.</hi> And that which enraged him againſt me, was, I being with a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour that lay very weak, and on her Death-Bed, there being ſeveral of the ſaid Prieſt's Congregation, I had a Teſtimony amongſt them, declaring a Day of Mortality to them, which accordingly fell out to Three or Four, in Two Weeks Time, which was taken Notice of; and the Prieſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing told of it, was enraged as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and contrived and made Uſe of ſeveral Inſtruments for the carrying on of his curſed Work.

took me from a Burial, and had me before them; the Manner of which, comes up before me at this Time.</p>
               <p>It being my Lot to be at the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of a Daughter of one profeſſing Truth, where I had a Teſtimony to the People, many being there of the Prieſt's Company, which greatly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him.

ſtand on my Feet; but by taking hold on a Friend that was near me, I ſaid, <hi>There is a Day coming, in the which, the God of Heaven and Earth will be too ſtrong for the ſtout-hearted amongſt you; therefore repent, and amend your Lives, while you have a Day, and a Time; for as the Tree falls, ſo it li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, and as Death leaves, Judgment finds, for there is no Repentance in the Grave; therefore haſten, haſten to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and Amendment of Life, for the Great God of Heaven and Earth will thin this Nation, for the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are too many that are ſinning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Lord.</hi> This, and much more ran thro' me; for my Heart was opened, and my Spirit great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enlarged by the mighty Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord, and drawn forth in Bowels of Love towards the People; for I ſaw the Tears running down many Faces, and many ſaid, they would never be again as they had been.

<pb n="91" facs="unknown:002815_0108_0FE64F0847CD1200"/>
open the Warrant, without rend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, crying, <hi>Oh! that I had been twenty Miles from my Habitation, that I had not had a Hand in this Work this Day; pray don't you take it ill of me, for I am forced to it; you muſt go with me before the Juſtices, but I wiſh I had been farther off, then I had had no Hand in troubling of you, pray don't you be angry with me.</hi> I ſaid, <hi>Don't be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ſo much, I am not offended.

She ſaid, There was a Day coming, in which the God of Heaven and Earth would be too ſtrong for the ſtout-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt us; and proclaimed a Day of Mortality amongſt us, and warned us to repent, and amend our Lives; ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it made my Heart to tremble.</hi> How!

Then he that was the moderate Juſtice, went forth out of the Room, and ſent one to me, to deſire me to go forth; I not being forward to go, for that honeſt Confeſſion of the poor Man, did me more Good, as I thought, than my

Releaſe at that Time.

For after he had ſent the Officers to our Meeting, which dealt roughly with us, by pulling and throwing, and threatning; all which did not content him. But a little after, as he was preaching in his Pulpit, he fell down dead, whilſt the Words were in his Mouth; as many of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers being th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But, ſaid the People, we hope it will be a Warning to him for to leave off perſecuting his Neighbours.

               <p>
                  <hi>John Hellier</hi> being the Head Man in this Work, our Headborough ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, <hi>What he ſhould do with us?</hi> he replied, <hi>Have them away to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon preſently.</hi> The Day being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>So they returned to their Maſter the Prieſt, and told him they had done his Work effectually, for we were all committed to Priſon. He

put off his Hat, and thanked them, and ſaid, <hi>It would add Years to his Life, now he ſhould live in Peace.</hi> But take Notice how ſhort his Days were. The Headborough on the Morrow Morning, went and told him, he muſt provide Horſes to carry the <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers</hi> to Priſon on.

The Officer was our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, a moderate Man, and what he did, was ſore againſt his Will; he came from the Prieſt's Houſe to ours, and told us what the Prieſt ſaid.

But the laſt Words was, <hi>He bid one of the Boys take a Halter and hang himſelf:</hi> And then lie fell down dead.

therein, and uſed all Means they could, there being many People about him: Some crying out, <hi>Don't you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Old Man; but let him go quietly.</hi> Aye, ſaid others, <hi>Let him depart in Peace, and don't you diſturb him, that his Neighbours</hi> (the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers) <hi>may abide at Home, and not go to Priſon.</hi> Some of the Neighbours came into our Shop with Joy, and ſaid, <hi>Now you may abide at Home, for Mr.</hi> Croſs <hi>is fallen down dead in the Church-yard.</hi> And he was going mad before, ſaid the Mother of one of the Boys; for, ſaid ſhe, <hi>He bid my Boy take a Halter and hang himſelf. Lord have Mercy upon me! what wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Counſel was that of a Miniſter,</hi> ſaid ſhe; <hi>we were in good Hopes that his falling down in the Pulpit would have been a Warning to him, but we ſee it is not; but after an Hour and halfs Time, he had ſo much Life, as that he called them that were about him, Rogues.</hi> So they carried him in his Chair, to his Bed, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſome Days, and died; but ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

ſenſible, as I was informed by ſeveral. But we were carried to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon before he died, where we had ſuch Entertainment, and hard Uſage, as follows.</p>
               <p>Our Keeper <hi>Giles Bale,</hi> and his Wife, put us in the Common-Goal, with Three Felons, that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to be hanged, and would not afford us Straw to lie upon, tho' we would have paid for it; they locked us up, and carried away the Key with them (they living ſome Diſtance from the Priſon) thereby to prevent the Under-Keeper from ſhewing us any Favour: And the Head-Keeper's Wife ſaid, <hi>There let them be like a Company of Rogues and Whores together. If I had a worſe Place, I would put them therein.</hi>

But when I lay down in that diſmal Place, it came into my Heart a Conſideration of theſe Things; ſaying in my Heart, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt for what we are expoſed to this Hardſhip, it is becauſe we cannot betray our Teſtimony, nor wrong our Conſcience, nor deal treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly with our own Souls. And ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is ſo, Lord, be thou our Comfort in this needful Time; for it is thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that makes hard Things eaſie, and bitter Things ſweet, and thou haſt ſweetned the Waters of a bitter Cup. O thou Phyſician of Value, that can ſtrengthen both Soul and Body I Be with

us this Night, and all the Nights and Days that we have to live in this World.</hi> Then the Lord was pleaſed to open my Heart unto him, and to fill it with his living Mercy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable Preſence, inſomuch that it overflowed my whole Heart, that I could have ſung aloud of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Lord, and of his Mercies and Bleſſings beſtowed upon us. But I looking over my Fellow-Priſoners, and ſeeing them ſo ſound aſleep, I did forbear to open my Mouth; but in the Morning there came many People to the Priſon-Door, to ſee how many of us were dead with our hard Fare; ſome of them was ſure (as they ſaid) that I was dead, for I look'd as if I would not live until the Morning. But then finding us all alive and well, they confeſs'd and ſaid, <hi>Surely we were the People of God, if there were any.</hi> That being the firſt Day, we had a Meeting in the Priſon, and many Friends came there, where we had a very good Meeting, and the good Preſence of the Lord
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:002815_0124_0FE64F1C78291B10"/>
was with us, and filled our Hearts with Joy and Gladneſs; inſomuch that I was conſtrained to praiſe the Name of the Lord, and magnify his Power, and to teſtify in the hearing of many People, that we were ſo far from repenting our coming there, that we had great Cauſe to give Glory, Honour and Praiſes to the Lord God of Heaven and Earth; for that he had found us worthy to ſuffer for his Name and Truth; for this powerful Preſence was with us, and ſanctified our Afflictions, and made the Priſon like a Palace unto us; and we would not change our State, for all the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the World, if it were proſtered unto us.</p>
               <p>This and much more ran thro' me, which I ſhall omit for Brevity-Sake: But in a Word great was the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Mercy of the Lord towards us, from Day to Day, that I have ſometimes ſaid, <hi>Surely the Lord is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring his People; he is weaning of them from this World.</hi> It ſeemed to me, as if I had no Habitation, but
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:002815_0125_0FE64EDFC138DDC0"/>
the Priſon; then was the Time for the Lord to reveal his Secrets unto his Children, that he had tried and proved in ſuch Things; for it was Faithfulneſs that rendred the faithful Servant acceptable in his Maſter's Sight, and cauſed him to ſay, <hi>Well done thou good and faithful Servant, thou haſt been faithful in a little, be thou Ruler over much;</hi> for I cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that him that is not true to a little, will ever be made Ruler over much. No, no, therefore keep to Truth in all Things, and to the plain Language, and teach your Children ſo to do, and as I have ſaid, In that Time of great Afflictions, and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and parting of many, Wife from Husband, and Husband from Wife, and both from tender Children; then was the Lord pleaſed to reveal his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets unto his Children. And ſeeing the Goodneſs of the Lord from Day to Day, and being made ſenſible of his gathering Arm from Day to Day, a great Concern came upon me for many careleſs ones, that had depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

Oh! in Conſideration of them, and their deplorable State, my Soul hath often been poured forth before the Lord, crying, <hi>O Lord, that they may come and partake with us of thy great Mercies, as we do from Day to Day.</hi> Then it would oftentimes come up before me, the great Diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour they had brought upon the Lord, and his bleſſed Truth, by their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs, and Unbelief. Yea, great Diſhonour indeed, they could not truſt the Lord, as if he had no Power or Strength to preſerve them. Then I cried, O Lord, many are weak and feeble, and the Cruelty of Men hath been great, terrible, and deſperately wicked; and thou haſt ſuffered them to be very cruel, to the Aſtoniſhment of many; inſomuch that many a poor Soul hath been toſſed as with a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

And Lord, thou knoweſt that my Heart is pained within me; my Soul is in Travail, and my Bowels is rolling towards the Poor and the Diſtreſſed, the toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Tempeſt, and not comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Enemy of their Souls is bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to caſt them down, and to fill their Minds with Trouble and Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, always caſting before them their Unfaithfulneſs, and would fain keep them in Bondage, and from return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto thee by true Repentance, that thou mayſt heal their Backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings, and teach them to be more faithful for Time to come. O Lord, what ſhall I do for them? They are often in my Remembrance. Lord, open my Heart in Prayer more and more and bow thy Ear to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of thy Servant, as thou haſt done many a Time; and accept of
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:002815_0128_0FE64F1E34EFA2C0"/>
the Prayer of thy Servant, for them who cannot pray for themſelves. O Lord, if it may ſtand with thy bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Will, once more to afford them a Day of Viſitation, and try them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. O Lord, deal not with them according to their Deſerts; but Lord, I pray thee, have Compaſſion on the Works of thy Hands, and remember poor Mortals this Day; for ſurely many of them are greatly diſtreſſed, and compaſſed about with many Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and my Heart is pained for them. And in this mournful State, the Lord was pleaſed to ſpeak com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably unto me in the Secret of my Heart, in a living Spring of Life, and ſaid, <hi>The Time of the Deliverance of my People draweth near, and nearer than many are aware of Tho' I have ſuffered their Enemies for a Time to triumph over them, yet too many have grown high and lofty, and forgotten the Days of their Diſtreſs and Calamity, and what State they were in when I firſt found them out, as it were without Hope: Then did I ſend forth my Light and my

Truth, which many received with Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of Heart, and with a ready Mind, and bowed thereunto, and yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Obedience for a Time. But after I had confounded their Enemies, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for their Deliverance, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched them greatly, then they forgot the Days of their Diſtreſs and Poverty, and the many Promiſes that they made unto me in the Day when they were ſorely beſet with many Enemies, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and without. But ſince I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared for them, and confounded their Foes, and have done more for them; than they looked for, or expected at my Hands, how have they forgotten to pay their Vows unto me, that many of them made unto me in the Days of their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs?

Miniſtry ſo dreadful, that it pierced the Hearts of Thouſands. O the Dread and Terror that ſeized upon my Heart, at the Sound of <hi>John Aud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land'</hi>s Voice, and the Sight of him, before I rightly underſtood what he ſaid. But before the Meeting was over, the Spirit of the Lord moved in my Heart, and in the Light I came to ſee my woful and deplorable State, which made me to cry to God for Mercy; a Day never to be forgotten by me. And now I have arrived to the Seven and Fiftieth Year of my Age. Oh! the many Deliverances, both inward and outward, have I been made a living Witneſs of. The many Decrees that have been Sealed againſt us, the many Threatnings of Ruin and Deſtruction have been ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Ears, how have we been as killed all the Day long? and count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as Sheep for the Slaughter, and yet behold we are a live to this Day to praiſe the Lord.

But our Enemies hath he overturned, and broken their Bands in ſunder, and have made them to bow under his dreadful Power, and hath taken many off in his Diſpleaſure. Oh! what ſhall I ſay in the Behalf of all theſe his wondrous Works, that mine Eyes have ſeen? but more eſpecially the inward Work of Regeneration. Oh! my Tongue is not able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Tenth Part of it, that the Lord hath been pleaſed to bring me thro'. Oh! what ſhall I ſay at the Remembrance of them, all which at this Time is livingly come up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; but bow before the Lord, and prize his Mercies for evermore.</p>

Therefore, don't you exerciſe your ſelves in any Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter too high for you, but mind the Motion of the Spirit in your own Hearts, and hearken diligently to the Voice of the Lord, that your Souls may live; and keep the Lord always in your Remembrance, that you ſin not againſt him. And remember to keep to the daily Croſs, which will crucify all the Motions of the Fleſh, and keep you alive to God, and near unto him; and in ſo doing, you will know his Councel; and <hi>ſeek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, and the Righteouſneſs thereof, above all Things</hi> in this World, <hi>and other Things ſhall be added unto you.</hi>

no, thy Account is very large that thou haſt to give unto the Lord, for thou haſt required the Lord Evil for Good; and for all his ender Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and loving Kindneſs, and his Forbearance and tender Compaſſions; notwithſtanding all this, thou art in thy Sins and Abominations, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on in the broad Way which leads unto Miſery and Deſtruction, and the End thereof will be everlaſting Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, World without End. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore remember it whilſt you have a little Time lent to you, and how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle none knows; therefore conſider it, and lay it to Heart, and remember that there is a God in Heaven that ought to be feared, for he is a juſt and righteous God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that will do righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly with all People.

O come now, let Fruits of Chriſtianity appear, which will be better than many Years talking of it; the Lord hath put a Day into your Hands again, wherein you may do good. O make a good Uſe of it, whilſt you have it, leſt you provoke the Lord to take it out of your Hands again, and leave you in Sorrow to lament. Then will your latter End be worſe than your Beginning, and your Account greater than ever, and your Meaſure more filled up than ever, and by ſo doing will be made fit for Deſtruction. Oh! my Soul's Deſire it, that where-ever this may come, that it may take Place upon the Hearts of People; for ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it is high Time for People to be awakened to Amendment of Life, ſeeing their Time is ſo far gone, that many have ſpent in Vanity and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which will add to their Sorrow upon their dying-Beds, when not one Day more will be left them for to repent.</hi>
