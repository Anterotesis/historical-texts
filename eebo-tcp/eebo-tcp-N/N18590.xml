            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>ECCLESIASTES iii, I5.</bibl>
               <q>THAT WHICH HATH BEEN, IS NOW; AND THAT WHICH IS TO BE HATH ALREADY BEEN; AND GOD REQUIRETH THAT WHICH IS PAST.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is hard to find a more complicated charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in all the annals of time, than that of <hi>Solomon.</hi> The firſt part of his life preſents us with the greateſt inſtance of human ſagacity, and wiſdom, joined with a ſpecial regard to religion and virtue, but a ſecond part was filled up with luxury and wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>THE juſt portrait we have of this complex character, not only exhibits the impartiality of the ſacred hiſtory; but is joined with a diſplay of infinite wiſdom.</p>
            <p>GOD in his all wiſe providence, raiſed <hi>Solomon,</hi> to the very ſummit or worldly glory. There was ſcarce a ſingle thing in all the rich variety of nature's garden, but he might pertake of at his pleaſure. But alas! inſtead of improving the mercies he had to the glory of that God from whom they came; he laid the reins on the neck of his luſts, and gave a looſe to almoſt every vain deſire. This conduct of <hi>Solomon</hi> appears the more exceedingly criminal, when we conſider <hi>his</hi> exalted ſtation in life, which gave <hi>him</hi> a ſuperior influence among men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:024126_0005_0FC3B5E31E681690"/>IT pleaſed the Lord however to magnify the infinite riches of his grace, in making this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated king of Iſrael, a true penitent for all his ſin. This occaſioned <hi>him</hi> to write the book, of which the words now read are a part. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed contains as full, and ample a confeſſion as any we ſhall find extant upon earth.</p>
            <p>BY this means the Lord has graciouſly left a ſacred record, a ſtanding monitor to the world. By which we are aſſured, that however great our abilities, however high our attainments in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and knowledge; or if we are raiſed to the ſummit of worldly honor and riches, yet that we are poor, fallible, changing creatures, whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dependant on him that made us. By this we are aſſured that all plans and ſyſtems, founded in human wiſdom, however we may think them placed on a ſure baſis, or arranged with the greateſt coherence; yet they are ſubject to er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror.</p>
            <p>IT is often that the turning of but one leaf in the book of divine providence, makes us ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that the firmneſs of their foundation, is not ſufficient to diſſipate our fears; or prevent the diſappointment of our moſt ſanguine expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. Well did the prophet ſay, Iſaiah ii.22 <hi>Ceaſe from man, whoſe breath is in his noſtrils: for wherein is he to be accounted of. Again</hi> Pſalms xxxix, 5. <hi>Verily every man at his beſt eſtate, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together vanity.</hi> This king of Iſrael, deeply ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this humiliating truth and the madneſs of his own ſin and ſolly while he anticipated the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:024126_0006_0FC3B5E4D740AAD0"/>
ſcene of trouble that muſt come upon his fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſubjects by his means; was led, in our context, particularly to warn others of the changing, fluctuating ſtate, of all men and things, in this ſinful world: and of the great neceſſity of our engroſſing in our affections ſome ſuperior objects for delight.</p>
            <p>ROVING in his thoughts, through the wild confuſion, of a ſinful world; he at length found the deſired object, (viz.) The ſyſtem of God's unchanging government, and the glory of his character diſplayed therein, for the good of being. Like the dove of Noah, he here found an ark of reſt. Here he had found a ſyſtem that could ſuffer no change. <hi>I know,</hi> ſays he, verſe I4th. <hi>That whatſoever Gcd doth it ſhall be forever: nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God doth it that men ſhould fear before him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FURTHER to expreſs his views, of its un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing ſameneſs, he makes uſe of the words of our text. <hi>That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been, and God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth that which is paſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS ſacred paſſage, therefore, affords us this ſoul conſolating doctrine; (viz.) that that eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal rule of righteouſneſs, contained in God's moral government, and the ground of our ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance with him, is ſo infinitely perfect, and ſo well ſuited to the capacities, and circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his creatures, on every occaſion, that it can admit of no change. But that which hath
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:024126_0007_0FC3B5E6E375BA70"/>
been the rule of our conduct towards God &amp; our fellow men, and that which hath been the ground of our acceptance with God, is now; and that which is to be hath already been. And likewiſe that the ſame virtuous exerciſes, that were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in paſt ages of the world, are required now.</p>
            <p>FOR our further improvement of this ſubject on the preſent important occaſion we ſhall ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</p>
            <p>I. THAT the ſcheme of divine adminiſtration, both in its nature and requirements, is ſo ſuited to the capacities of men, that it is the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible duty, of all ranks of men, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, cheerfully to ſubmit to, and obey God therein,</p>
            <p>II. THAT this obedience only, can afford ſubſtantial and laſting ſatiſfaction to the human heart.</p>
            <p>III. THAT this obedience will qualify us to fill our ſeveral ſtations in life, as well in the civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il as the eccleſiaſtical kingdom, to the glory of God and the good of our fellow men.</p>
            <p>I. THAT the ſcheme of divine adminiſtration, both in its nature and requirements, is ſo ſuited to the capacities of men, that it is the indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible duty, of all ranks of men, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction, cheerfully to ſubmit to and obey God therein.</p>
            <p>THE nature of divine government is like its author, infinitely holy, juſt and good. Its holy nature is eaſily ſeen, when we conſider its great
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:024126_0008_0FC3B5EE00BE46F0"/>
end and deſign; which is to aſſert the rights of the Godhead, and invariably to vindicate truth and ſuppreſs falſehood: and that in a manner directly tending to the general good of being.</p>
            <p>ONE very conſiderable branch of divine ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is to be ſeen in the creation of the world: in which there are creatures made of different ranks, and their different ſtations aſſigned them, exactly according to their various capacities. As we are favored with a rank among the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, what more immediately concerns us to know, is, <hi>our</hi> own ſtation in the ſcale of being, and what is the buſineſs aſſigned us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
            <p>THAT we are made rational creatures, capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of contemplating upon and exploring objects preſented to our view, is a truth, this reſpectable audience, will think it needleſs to uſe arguments to prove.</p>
            <p>IF this be granted we are neceſſitated to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that we are capable, in ſome meaſure, to judge of the quality of thoſe objects; and feel ourſelves conſciouſly concerned, to eſtimate them according to their real value. The moſt valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble objects, therefore, that come within the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of our ſpeculation, juſtly merit our greateſt attention. Nor can this be eſteemed a hardſhip to a rational mind, if rightly diſpoſed, Should we not indeed feel ourſelves greatly injured, if we were prohibited contemplation, on the beſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects preſented to our view, and were obliged to fill up all our ſearches and reſearches on an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior good.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:024126_0009_0FC3B5EF8FD730E8"/>ONE part of the buſineſs, therefore aſſigned us in the ſyſtem, and which appears well adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our capacities, is to employ our thoughts in contemplating on, and in forming a right judgment of thoſe glorious perfections of the Deity, which are ſo clearly manifeſted in his works.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER branch of our work is, always to be employed in loving thoſe objects that are made known to us, according to their real worth.
THIS alſo is an eaſy yoke, well ſuited to our necks. That we are capable of loving objects of a moral nature, will hardly be denied: for as we cannot be delighted in objects that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not love, we either muſt allow that we are inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitated for any higher enjoyments, than thoſe which are merely natural, or that we are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, affectionately to embrace, the important ideas of holineſs and virtue. If we admit the former, then we are driven to the diſagreeable neceſſity of believing, that there are no objects for delight, afforded us in the univerſe, but thoſe which our context and our own experience proves, to be as unſtable as water, and intirely inſufficient. If the latter then, we muſt allow, that our ſupreme affection and delight, ought ever to be placed on that God who is the eſſence of all poſſible excellence and glory.</p>
            <p>THE principles of common juſtice dictate, that every being ought to be loved according to their real worth; as God therefore is the ſupreme good in the univerſe, he juſtly claims our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:024126_0010_0FC3B5F103D32BF8"/>
affections. This is ſo well ſuited to our capacities, that if we rove in our affections through all the glories of this world, we ſhall find no reſt; nothing permanent, no ſuitable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for delight: untiil we ſay with the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Return unto thy reſt, O my Soul, for the Lord hath deals bountifully with thee.</hi> Pſalms, cx, 7. I am not inſenſible that the cavils of wicked men are often raiſed againſt the degree of this holy exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe which the divine law requires of us. But ſhall I aſk, what is the extent of its requiſſtions? The Lord Jeſus defines it thus, <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul and with all thy mind, and thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour as thyſelf.</hi> Matthew, xxii, 37, 39—On theſe two hang all the law and the prophets. This reduced to practice in heart, lip, and life, compriſes the whole duty of man.</p>
            <p>NOR can this juſtly be thought too ſevere; for there is nothing more required than all the heart, ſoul, and mind, that is, all the faculties that are given. And for God to give faculties to us ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of virtuous exerciſes, and not require the uſe of them would be unjuſt, and directly mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate againſt the happineſs of his creatures.</p>
            <p>As to the love required to our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is to love our neighbour as ourſelves. This alſo is right and fit in the nature of things, for as every creature ought to be loved in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its real worth, in the ſcale of being; and as our fellow men hold the ſame rank with us in the ſyſtem, we ought therefore to love them as ourſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:024126_0011_0FC3B5F273B54630"/>ANOTHER idea implied, in this obedience to God, is an unreſerved ſubmiſſion to his ſovereign will. This alſo is juſt and reaſonable: for as with the all-wiſe and omniſcient Jehovah, there can be no poſſible error, either in judgment or deſign, it is infinitely fit that he ſhould have the ſovereign diſpoſal of all events.</p>
            <p>NOR does this take any privilege from us; ſeeing we are capacitated to be happy only is a cheerful obedience to him. So long as we may reſt aſſured, that the judge of all the earth will do right, it can never afford us any uneaſineſs that he ſhould govern, unleſs we are unwilling that right ſhould take place.</p>
            <p>THIS leads us to ſee the neceſſity of faith in God, as another branch of our duty to him. By faith I mean, that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of the mind, by which we affectionately embrace, and unreſervedly rely, on the truth of God, which he has made manifeſt concerning his character and will: and thoſe things which reſpect the relation we ſtand in to him, and our fellow creatures. No other evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is neceſſary for the ground of this faith, than to be aſſured, that the doctrine propoſed for our belief comes from God. That we are capable of believing the truth upon this evid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, will not be denied; and for finite crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to call in queſtion the teſtimony of the God of truth, is a crime of the firſt magnitude. Hence faith the apoſtle, I John v. I0. <hi>He that believeth not God hath made him a liar, becauſe he believeth not the record God gave of his ſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:024126_0012_0FC3B5F3F99760B0"/>FROM the whole it appears that the nature of the divine government, in all its demands upon us, is perfectly ſuited to our capacities, and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecures all our rights to us.</p>
            <p>An impartial view of this made our Saviour ſay, Matt. xi, 29, 30. <hi>Take my yoke upon you and learn of me, for my yoke is eaſy and my burden is light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE cannot therefore call in queſtion the moſt ſacred obligations that all men are under without diſtinction, to obey theſe divine precepts: ſeeing it is a law that neceſſarily exiſts, in conſequence of our relation to God, as his creatures, and not arbitrarily impoſed on us, by him, as a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign.</p>
            <p>BY this time, perhaps, ſome may think, that the ſpeaker has forgotten the doctrine we ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten hear from the pulpit, viz. that mankind are fallen, depraved creatures, wholly dead in treſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and ſins. Indeed I have not forgotten ſo great a truth, which is not only aſſerted by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, Epheſians ii, I, but is always written in indelible characters before my eyes. But we wiſh however to have ſkill enough to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the depravity of the human heart, and thoſe faculties by which we are capacitated to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey God. The apoſtle hath well expreſſed the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea of depravity: <hi>dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> This death therefore cannot conſiſt in reducing our natural faculties to a ſtate or inactivity: other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we could not be active in treſpaſſes and ſins.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:024126_0013_0FC3B5F5C9BC9D60"/>Depravity therefore, muſt reſpect the diſpoſition of the heart: and the ſenſe is, that man, by his fall from God, has loſt his original righteouſneſs, and is now wholly and voluntarily oppoſed to virtue.</p>
            <p>NOR can this juſtly be conſidered in the leaſt degree to leſſen our obligations: for it is not the virtue or vice that we poſſeſs, that is the bond of our obligation to God. Should a perſon guilty of treaſon againſt the ſtate, be brought before this venerable court, and appear wilfully determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to purſue his villainy, would they judge that the vileneſs of his diſpoſition ſhould exculpate him from blame? Would they not rather think that ſuch a judgment would be taking ſides with the criminal? Neither can the vileneſs of our hearts, be any juſt excuſe for our rebellion againſt God our rightful ſovereign.</p>
            <p>IT may be ſaid, if men are thus guilty, how is it God ſpares the criminal, and continues the world in its preſent ſtate? I anſwer, only upon the plan of grace which reſpects the unworthy. This GRACE however is exerciſed in a way per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conſonant with the divine law and gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment.</p>
            <p>HERE we ſee the neceſſity of a mediator, to make atonement for ſin. It can be thought but doing juſtice to the ſubject, to advert for a few minutes to the character and work of Chriſt as mediator.</p>
            <p>ST. John in the beginning of his goſpel gives in the following important account of the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:024126_0014_0FC3B5F70F7F4130"/>of Chriſt. <hi>In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. All things were made by him, and without him there was not any thing made that was made. And the word was made fleſh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory, as the glory of the only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the Father full of grace and truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM hence we learn, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is very God, that all created things were made by him, that he is of the one undivided of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, equal with God, and that he became fleſh, or took upon him our nature; ſo that he is very man as well as God: alſo that this God-man is full of grace and truth. Full of the deſigns of grace and mercy to a guilty world, and fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to exhibit that grace in a manner that ſhould aſſert the truth, reſpecting the rights of the Godhead, and the honors of divine law and government.</p>
            <p>No leſs a character than this, is equal to the work of a mediator between offended juſtice, and the offending ſinner. As ſin is againſt an infinite God, there muſt be an infinite diſplay made of his diſapprobation of it: otherwiſe hiſ character and government could not be vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The creature being finite, this diſplay could not be made, in the execution of penalty on the ſinner, in any other way, than that the ſentence ſhould extend to an infinite duration of puniſhment. Hence we ſee why the ſacred ſcriptures threaten everlaſting puniſhment upon the wicked.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:024126_0015_0FC3B5F87054B228"/>LET us pause a moment! What mean crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, however exalted in the ſcale of being, that would not bluſh to attempt the unequal taſk, of making to atonement anſwerable to the demands of infinite juſtice? And ſhould we not all ſhrink at the thought that divinity ſhould change, and become a ſuffering advocate? Here all created intelligences are thrown into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation! condemnation to the criminal muſt ſparkle in every eye! Until the complex char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of the <hi>God-man</hi> appears: who in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature was able by his obedience, perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to illuſtrate the glory, and vindicate the honors of the divine precepts: and by his ſuffering and death, fully to diſcloſe the divine righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the penal part of the law. Although his ſufferings were comparatively ſhort, yet the infinitive dignity of his perſon was ſuch, that he was able to bear the whole at once. In this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and ſuffering of Chriſt, we ſee a full diſplay made, of that infinite rule of right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the divine law, and of God's holy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt ſin.</p>
            <p>HERE we ſee a way opened for God to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe grace and mercy, to the ſinner, conſiſtent with the rights of juſtice. Through this atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the Holy Ghoſt is ſent down to renew the hearts of man, and bring them to acknowledge the rights of juſtice in repentance for ſin; and by faith to truſt alone in this complete righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt for juſtification,—as the ground of our acceptance with God.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:024126_0016_0FC3B5FA0F76D108"/>THIS will appear the more conſiſtent, when we conſider that the Lord Jeſus, not only ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and died, but that he roſe again from the dead; aſcended up on high <hi>who is ſet on the right hand of the throne of the majeſty in the heavens.</hi> Heb. VIII.I. And that all judgment is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto him, and all power both in heaven and earth. This gracious prince therefore, is become the rightful legiſlator of the world. Seated on a throne of grace his government to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards us is a gracious adminiſtration. Hence it is the world is ſpared in its preſent ſtate, and a ſpace allowed us for repentance.</p>
            <p>BY this, I think we muſt be aſſured of our renewed obligations to love, fear and ſerve God, who has made ſuch rich diſplays of himſelf; both as a God of grace and juſtice: and alſo, immediately, to repent of our ſins, and believe the teſtimony which God hath given of his ſon. Otherwiſe our crimes will be greatly augmented in his ſight. But it is time that I haſtened to ſhew,</p>
            <p>II. THAT this obedience only can afford ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial and laſting ſatisfaction to the human heart.</p>
            <p>That object in the univerſe that is of the moſt real worth, in its own eſſential properties; muſt be thought the moſt delightful object for our contemplation: if we are rightly diſpoſed and can have acceſs to the knowledge ot it.</p>
            <p>THAT God is this ſupreme good, and that he has revealed himſelf to man as ſuch, we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:024126_0017_0FC3B5FB85916A40"/>
noticed. And as we cannot be delighted in things that we have no knowledge of, it muſt be eſſential to our happineſs to employ our thoughts in contemplating on the glories of the divine character. To paſs this unnoticed is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to remain ignorant of, and deſtitute of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, the greateſt good.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, however much we may know of the qualities of an object, yet if we do not love it, the more we know of it the more diſagreeable feelings we have; love therefore, to thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the divine character which he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, is eſſential to our happineſs.</p>
            <p>THIS leads us to obſerve, that if we know and love God as he is, infinitely holy, juſt and good; with whom there can be no poſſible error, either in judgment or deſign; we cannot be happy un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we freely reſign the diſpoſal of all events into his hands. And to be deprived of believing it ſuch a being, would be to prohibit our confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the ſupreme object of our delight.</p>
            <p>FURTHERMORE, he who walks in this obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ly choſes God for his portion, and the chief object of his delight. Here he has <hi>an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance that is incorruptible and that fadeth not away.</hi> In this he is not ſubject to diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as others are; though he may be diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in creature good, yet he can ſay with the prophet, Heb. iii, I7, I8. Although the figtree, the vine, the olive, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> and the flock ſhould fail, <hi>yet will I rejoice in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:024126_0018_0FC3B5FD12918A40"/>As the divine law and government contains a perfect rule of right, it can never operate to the diſadvantage of any one, that is an obedient ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And as it is below the dignity of a ration<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conſcious mind to be happy in oppoſition to right, it is eaſy to ſee that a conformity to the divine law is eſſential to our happineſs. Indeed it is impoſſible for a man to be happy without the temper of mind that the law requires, viz. love or real benevolence; if we have not this we muſt be poſſeſſed of its oppoſite; unleſs we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that we can fall into a ſtate of entire indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and without any affectionate regard to any being whatever, which would be to fall below the rank of rational creatures.</p>
            <p>THE oppoſite to benevolence is to eſtimate our own happineſs, and the gratification of our own deſires, above the honor of God, and the good of being in general. How miſerable ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon muſt be! having ſet up himſelf in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the divine glory and the general good of being, in the promotion of which all events muſt finally terminate: every event therefore in the univerſe muſt neceſſarily operate againſt him, and fill the mind with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>uſion and guilt: unleſs at times (while in this world) the mind is amuſed, and the conſcience lull'd aſleep, in the gratification of animal ſenſations.</p>
            <p>BUT on the contrary, how happy is that ſoul, which glows with ſupreme love to God; and with undiſſembled benevolence to being in gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. And while he reſts aſſured that the allwiſe
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:024126_0019_0FC3B5FE96239E28"/>
legiſlator of the world governs in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, he delights himſelf in the ſweet employment of glorifying him, and doing good to his fellow creatures. Thus, while the mind is releaſed from the narrow circle of ſelfiſhneſs, it can rove in the extenſive fields of truth and righteouſneſs, and partake of the ſweet fruits of holineſs and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>This benevolence to being in general, muſt include our love in particular to thoſe of our own ſpecies, with whom we are more immediately converſant, and to whom we are more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called to adminiſter good. And who can but ſee what a heaven upon earth we ſhould have, if this diſpoſition was to govern in families, neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhoods, towns, and kingdoms.</p>
            <p>AGAIN, as without repentance towards God, and faith in our Lord Jeſus Christ, we cannot pleaſe God, this alſo muſt be eſſential to our happineſs. By repentance we turn from ſin un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and cheerfully ſubmit to his government: By faith we affectionately embrace, and unreſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly rely on the characters, offices and work of Chriſt as mediator, and receive his righteouſneſs, as the alone matter of our juſtification: through which we receive the free pardon of all our ſins, peace of conſcience, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>THIS righteouſneſs is an everlaſting righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that which man had in his firſt ſtate was not ſo, That righteouſneſs he deſtroyed by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. if we indeed were to be ſet back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain upon the ſoul of creature righteouſneſs, it
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:024126_0020_0FC3B600273DBB08"/>
would not be fit that an abſolute promiſe of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life ſhould be made us upon it: for we might deſtroy it again by ſin, and become un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous. But this righteouſneſs, compleated by a redeemer, will everlaſtingly ſecure the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of infinite juſtice, while gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e is diſplayed in our redemption and juſtification. We ſee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that here is a permanent foundation for hope and delight.</p>
            <p>FURTHER, to illuſtrate that our happineſs is connected with obedience to God, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that it unites us with, and engages us in, the ſame cauſe that God himſelf, the holy angels, the glorified ſpirits in heaven, and all the virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous on earth are engaged in. The cauſe I mean is that of truth and righteouſneſs. If therefore we are heartily engaged in this cauſe, we are in fellowſhip and agreement with them. Here we may reſt aſſured of the divine approbation and protection. Here we ſhall ſhare in the kind of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of angels, as miniſtering ſpirits, ſent forth to <hi>miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation.</hi> In this alſo, we ſhall enjoy the prayers of all the ſaints upon earth, and the good wiſhes of thoſe in heaven. We may ſay then with the apoſtle, Rom. viii, 3I. <hi>If God be for us who can be againſt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this righteous cauſe we are aſſured of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory over all our enemies, and that they muſt fall victims to divine juſtice, in the end, unleſs we admit, that God, at laſt, will ſuffer virtue to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a prey to vice, and truth to falſhood. We come to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:024126_0021_0FC3B60185491E70"/>III. THAT this obedience will qualify us, to fill our ſeveral ſtations in life, as well in the civil as the eccleſiaſtical kingdom, to the glory of God and the good of our fellow men.</p>
            <p>RIGHT views of God and his government, gives us right ideas of holineſs, truth, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and juſtice, adminiſtered according to the true principles of benevolence. That theſe are the principles on which all governments ought to be adminiſtered, will not be denied. That a competent degree of knowledge therefore, in this divine ſyſtem, is needful in order to the right ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of government, is equally obvious. If then we have ſo filled up our ſearches and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches, as to have obtained a good degree of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with this infinitely perfect ſyſtem, it will follow what we have acquired one very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant qualification, to be uſeful either in church or ſtate.</p>
            <p>PUT on the contrary, to remain ignorant of this, is always to remain ignorant of what is right; and conſequently not qualified to do right. Such ignorance as this is the cauſe why ſome men are to anxious to be promoted in places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic truſt. Puffed up with a ſenſe of their own importance, and ſtimulated from pecuniary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, they eagerly ruſh into important ſtations in life, ignorant of the great buſineſs they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; and without any proper concern, either for the glory of God, or the good of ſociety.</p>
            <p>THE parable of Jotham, as in Judges, 9th chapter, gives a juſt portrait of ſuch characters;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:024126_0022_0FC3B60325B945B8"/>
for while a becoming diffidence poſſeſſed the minds of thoſe worthy characters, who may fitly be compared to the olive, the figure and the vine; yet the bramble, not only destitute of thoſe ſweet fruits ſo uſeful to mankind, bur are full of pricking thorns, was ready to accept the office of ruler over the trees. Brambles indeed are ſuch ſelfiſh rulers! and experience often makes good the prophet's words: The beſt of them is as a brier, and the moſt upright is ſharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than a thorn hedge. Micah vii, 4</p>
            <p>BUT thoſe, whoſe real merit brings them to poſts of honor, feel feaſible that they have need of wiſdom and prudence, need to ponder the paths of their feet, that they might ſo ſteer the helm of government, as to run clear of thoſe fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bars, that always lie in the narrow gulf of a wicked and ſelfiſh adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>BUT knowledge only will not complete a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous character; love alſo to the truth we know is an eſſential qualification: for as we are gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally governed by the ſupreme object of our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, we ſhall never make it our chief concern to fill our ſeveral ſtations among men, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the divine character and will, unleſs he has our ſupreme affections. I do not ſay but that an unregenerate man, or one who has not true love to God, may be uſeful in civil ſociety, and do many noble things, both in the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and executive departments, or that he may not do valiantly in the martial line, and in many other reſpects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:024126_0023_0FC3B6048DF0D518"/>WICKED men are not only often reſtrained, by the all powerful influence of Jehovah, from thoſe vicious acts, which would be hurtful to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety; but are ſometimes influenced, contrary to the general bias of their minds, to do things that are for the general good. But this by no means argues, that we ſhould tempt God, by filling the important places of public truſt with wicked men. Neither does it argue, but that the truly virtuous mind is the beſt qualified to ſerve the public.</p>
            <p>WHAT ſhould we have left of a truly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic character, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> we ſubtract from it all love to the perfect rule of right, and the general good of the people? He might indeed have great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural powers, and large acquired abilities, an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy powerful and pathetic addreſs; but does not love to uſe them for the general good of ſociety. We cannot but fear the conſequences of promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a character. But when we ſee a man put into office, who poſſeſſes a real ſpirit of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm, it is with pleaſure that we anticipate the happineſs we expect to enjoy under his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, as a miniſter of God for good to the people.</p>
            <p>SUBJECTION to divine ſovereignty, is alſo a uſeful qualification for men intruſted with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of ſtate; otherwiſe in the moſt trying and critical circumſtances of government, he is lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be thrown into anxiety and confuſion: which will unfit him for thoſe manly exerciſes which the important duties of his ſtation calls for, in ſo intereſting a period.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:024126_0024_0FC3B605FAB47910"/>As the character, offices and work of Chriſt, gives us the greateſt and richeſt diſplay of the divine character and government; we can but think that faith in him, is at leaſt a very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful qualification for a civil officer. Without this it is impoſſible to pleaſe God: becauſe if we do not believe God, we do not put confidence in, nor rely on his teſtimony, but practically ſay that he is a lier, which can he thought no leſs than an inſult upon his INFINITE MAJESTY.</p>
            <p>WE may not expect therefore than an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever will ever act from the principles of true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, in any thing that he does. But more eſpecially we cannot expect it, from thoſe who are ſo lost to all virtue, as to openly treat the character, offices, and work of Chriſt, as medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator, with contempt. Eſpecially when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider then ſo hardened in ſin, as to riſe in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the teſtimony of God the Father, Son and Spirit; and in oppoſition to the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of angels, of prophets, apoſtles, and all the ſaints in every age of the world; alſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the miraculous operations of the Holy Ghoſt, to confirm the divine miſſion of Chriſt, and his apoſtles; and againſt all the corroborat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimonies of divine providence, in almoſt every age of the world.</p>
            <p>I DO not ſay, indeed, but that even thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels, (under the reſtraints before mentioned) may do many things that may be for the public good. Yet I think that we cannot deny, but that a truly virtuous and benevolent mind is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

qualified to manage the great affairs of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, on which the general good ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends.</p>
            <p>AGAIN it is eaſy for an unprejudiced mind to ſee, that the temper and practice inculcated by the goſpel of Chriſt, is eſſential to the good of ſociety, viz. love to God and man, ſubjection to the divine will, faith in the ſyſtem of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and truth: alſo meekneſs and humility, calmneſs and patience, a deſire to forgive injuries, and to do by others as we would that they ſhould do by us. Theſe things if reduced to practice, will make the child obedient to his parents, the parent to bring up his children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord; and makes the ſubjects yield all due ſubmiſſion to magiſtracy as an ordinance of God: and the magiſtrate to fill his important ſtation, as a miniſter of God for good to the people. And who will ſay that theſe are not excellent qualifications for a civil officer.</p>
            <p>IT is objected, that in many inſtances, thoſe rulers who have made the higheſt profeſſion of the chriſtian religion, have been the moſt tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical and cruel.</p>
            <p>THIS I will not undertake to deny, but it is however to be remembered, that a profeſſion on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of religion, is very different from the real poſſeſſion of it in heart and practice. Had thoſe antichriſtian rulers (as I muſt call them) have been as much concerned to be governed by reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as they were to govern <hi>it</hi> by the civil
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:024126_0026_0FC3B618552525A0"/>ſword, they would never have invaded the ſacred rights of conſcience in the manner they did. But making religion a mere engine of ſtate policy, and ſetting up its miniſters to be ſupported by the civil arm; their office ſoon became a place of worldly honor and profit. This occaſioned perſons of ſuperior advantages in life, merely from pecuniary views, to invade the ſacred of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. And what was the event but a ſcene of horrid prieſt craft, attended with pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences. This I think however, is ſo far from any juſt objection, that it rather argues the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of pious and chriſtian rulers. Such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, as have ſo ſacred a regard for the rights and liberties of the people, both civil and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligous, as that they will ſeek to preserve them inviolate.</p>
            <p>I AM far from wiſhing to have America in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in the great error of blending the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of church and ſtate together. But I heartily wiſh that all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> may be truly virtuous, and ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 words">
                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in the fear of God.</p>
            <p>THEIR ſuperior influence among men argues the neceſſity of it, their examples have great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon the common people. One vicious magiſtrate will do more towards corrupting the morals of the people, and leſſening the energy of government, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> others. Such is the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of men, that we ſhall ſcarce ever find a magis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate that is openly vile, but he has a number around him, that are glad to follow his pernicious
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:024126_0027_0FC3B623E2965308"/>
examples; and however ſuch magiſtrates may do good in ſome things, yet the hurt they do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventually, far exceeds all the benefit we receive from them.</p>
            <p>THE nature of a republican government, is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother argument why virtue ſhould be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a neceſſary qualification for a civil ruler. It is obſerved by an ingenious author, "that in deſpotic governments, the force of education is to inculcate fear; in monarchal governments, to inculcate honor; &amp; in republican governments to inculcate virtue." This is true, for virtue is the baſis of a free and republican government.</p>
            <p>THIS virtue in the people principally conſiſts in three things. Iſt. In forming a conſtitution that is a proper baſis for a virtuous government. 2d. In chooſing virtuous rulers to adminiſter upon it. 3d. In a cheerful ſubmiſſion to their righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous adminiſtration. But this golden chain is at once broken, unleſs we admit that virtue is a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary qualification for a civil ruler.</p>
            <p>FROM the whole it appears that the more we are conformed to the unchanging, and perfect rule of righteouſneſs, the more ſolid and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial happineſs we have, and the better we are qualified to do good to others. What remains therefore is ſome reflections in ſuitable addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</p>
            <p>OUR chief magiſtrate juſtly claims our firſt attention.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it pleaſe your excellency,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is with pleaſure we behold you as God's miniſter
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:024126_0028_0FC3B624CD1286F0"/>for good, to this great and growing people: your often and repeated election to the higheſt; fear in this commonwealth, gives you the greateſt aſſurance of the love and confidence of the people. May it ever be with grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements, that we as a people reflect on the goodneſs of our God, that has raiſed up one from amongſt us, of our brethren, who was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and willing to take us by the hand in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy and weakneſs, and ſafely lead us forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the brilliant fields of liberty, peace, and good government; until we have juſtly merited the approbation and eſteem of our ſiſter ſtates, and are accounted worthy to hold a ſeat in the government of the great and growing empire of America.</p>
            <p>MAY it ſtill pleaſe the great benefactor of the world, to ſcatter light in your paths, and ſafely conduct you through the many difficulties that attend the important ſtation, that God and your brethren have called you to. We can aſſure you our moſt fervent prayers, that you may be ſucceeded in all your efforts to promote the general good of the ſtate; and in giving prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er energy to government.</p>
            <p>YOUR excellency is ſenſible that while you have the approbation and eſteem of your breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, it is of the laſt importance, that all the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices done to your country, are done from ſuch motives, as will meet the approbation of him, who is the great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>SELF EXAMINATION well becomes one who fills the chair or ſtate. A wrong temper of mind ſeldom fails to miſguide the judgment; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of which are the more fatal, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the truſt repoſed in us. A miſtake in the helmſman often proves fatal, both to the ſhip and all on board. The wiſe magiſtrate therefore, will examine his own heart, and will aſcend the throne of power with the prayer of the pſalmiſt. <hi>Search me O God and know my heart; try me and know my thoughts; and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FOR one who fills the chair of ſtate, to have the motives of his actions, encloſed in the dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dungeon of ſelfiſhneſs and pride, in which there is no light, for right judging of matters, but what forces its way through the dreary gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>es of a ſtifled conſcience, is far below the dignity of his ſtation. And to die in ſuch a ſtate, is to go from a throne of power, and ſeat of judgment on earth, to be judged as a guilty criminal, at the bar of almighty God.</p>
            <p>BUT on the contrary, if his eye is ſingle to the glory of God, his whole body is full of light, and his patriotic breaſt will glow with deſire for the general good of his ſubjects; who are made to rejoice under his faithful adminiſtration. Your excellency, therefore, will feel the importance of being perſonally virtuous in heart, lip and life;
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:024126_0030_0FC3B627C23692F8"/>otherwiſe your ſacred office, of ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the ſtate, will not appear with that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al importance which it deſerves, and which is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to give proper energy to government.</p>
            <p>MAY the Lord grant you grace and wiſdom, to fill the important ſtation you hold, to his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and the people's good. That you at laſt may cloſe a life of long uſefulneſs here, with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation of him, by whom kings reign and princes decree juſtice.</p>
            <p>SHALL I be indulged, while I include your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency in an addreſs to his honor the lieutenant governor, the honorable council, and houſe of repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>VENERABLE AND RESPECTFUL RULERS,</p>
            <p>You are this day, by the free ſuffrages of your brethren, veſted with the full power of legiſlation for a great and growing people: the oath of God is upon you, to maintain the ſacred principles of our conſtitution. You have bound yourſelves, by all that is ſacred, to the faithful diſcharge of your office. In addition to your oath you will feel the ſacred injunctions of the divine law, which muſt neceſſarily exiſt as long as truth remains ſacred.</p>
            <p>THIS law of love to God and man, is eſſential to a truly patriotic character. It becomes you therefore, as men, as citizens, and eſpecially as rulers, to examine your own hearts, whether you have true evangelical repentance towards God, and that faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt that works by love and purifies the heart. Be aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

            <p>YOUR honors will also feel ſenſible, that your own importance as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>rs, the goal of ſociety, and the energy of our excellent government, much depends on your being cloathed with prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical piety.</p>
            <p>FOR thoſe who are concerned in enacting laws, ſuitable for the regulation of our conduct in civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il life, to be guilty of wronging their creditors, by keeping them out of their juſt dues, or by over reaching, cheating and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>A WISE magiſtrate will let a conſtant guard over the words of his mouth; that with a becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moderation, he may expreſs his reſentment of injuries done <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

treating mankind, better fits the character of a clown than a gentleman. Can I ſuppoſe myſelf in danger of giving offence? No, I cannot think that ſo reſpectable a body, as I am now called to addreſs, will think me too ſevere in centuring ſo great an evil: eſpecially ſeeing it ſo much prevails in our land at the preſent day.</p>
            <p>We, your children, ſhall look up to you as our political fathers, that all thoſe officers who come under the direction of your wiſdom to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point, will be ſuch characters as ſhall do honor to their office. Such as are men of integrity and uprightness. Such as ſhall make conſcience of executing the law on offenders, and ſuch whoſe examples ſhall give energy to government.</p>
            <p>THE inſtitution of learning is of great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to a tree people. Grateful acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are juſtly due to our wise legiſlators, whoſe liberal and friendly exertions, has given ſo early a birth to an inſtitution of this kind, in this infant ſtate. The tender mother of this promiſing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant, will never forget her ſucking child, but will nouriſh and cheriſh it; from whom ſhe may juſtly expect protection and ſupport in her riper years.</p>
            <p>As religion at all times, is a matter between God and individuals, your honors will never think it within the limits of your legiſlation, to dictate the conſcience of a ſingle individual. The unchangeable law of righteousneſs, forbids us to delegate ſuch a power to any man, or body of

            <p>As a man, it is the duty of a magiſtrate, to befriend the cauſe of religion in the profeſſion and practice of it. As the head of a family he ſhould maintain family worſhip, and bring up his children <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>PERMIT me here to introduce the words of an ingenous author<note n="*" place="bottom">DR. STILLMAN.</note>, whoſe learning and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence adds weight to his ſentiments. "As a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate he ſhould be a nurſing father to the church of Chriſt, by protecting all the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able members of it, from injury on account of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and by ſecuring to them the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted enjoyment of equal religious liberty." And after obſerving the neceſſity of union in the ſtate, he adds, "On the other hand, if the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate deſtroys the equality of the ſubjects of the ſtate on account of religion, he violates a fundamental principle of a free government, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablishes a ſeperate intereſt in it, and lays a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for diſaffection to rulers, and endleſs quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels among the people."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:024126_0034_0FC3B62F5E1D8C88"/>THIS however, by no means prohibits the civ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>il magiſtrate from enacting thoſe laws that ſhall enforce the obſervance of thoſe precepts in the chriſtian religion, the violation of which is a breach of the civil peace ; viz. ſuch as forbid murder, theft, adultery, falſe witneſs, and injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our neighbour, either in perſon, name, or eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. And among others, that of obſerving the Sabbath, ſhould be enforced by the civil power. Otherwiſe, thoſe irreligious perſons who are ſo loſt to virtue, as neither to regard divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, nor the time appointed for it, will not only interrupt us, by coming to our houſes in our ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and drawing off our children from good order and family government, but will alſo, in attending to their worldly buſineſs, diſturb us in the hours of our moſt ſolemn devotions to God. And this is not all, but tyrannical and cruel maſters will be allowed to ſubject their ſervants to a conſtant ſeries of labour, without proper time to reſt, or attend to the important concerns of a future world. One reaſon given by Moſes for keeping the Sabbath, was, that thy man ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant and thy maid ſervant may reſt as well as thou.</p>
            <p>As to the aid of the civil power to force men to ſupport goſpel miniſters, I humbly conceive that it never can be neceſſary. This they will do freely, unleſs it is contrary either to their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, or wills; if contrary to their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to force them is the worſt of tyranny, if
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:024126_0035_0FC3B630CA91FE60"/>
contrary to their wills, like Peter's ſword it cuts off the ear, and fills the mind with prejudice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt both the doctrine and the preacher, and of courſe does hurt to the cauſe of religion. All ſuch as are friends to religion, are heartily wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to comply with thoſe plain injunctions of heaven, that require the honorable ſupport of goſpel miniſters. And if we would make them religious that are not, it is a poor way firſt so be let them by cutting their purſe-ſtrings with the civil ſword, which lays a fatal bar againſt our having acceſs to their conſciences afterwards. I appears therefore, that as religion is a benefit to ſociety, that forcing men to ſupport its min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters, is a damage both to church and ſtate.</p>
            <p>MAY the great legiſlator of the world honor you with his divine preſence and bleſſing, and prefine over you in all your deliberations: that the people may rejoice under your wife and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous adminiſtration, and you be ſo happy at laſt as to meet the approbation of him, who is king of kings, and lord of lords.</p>
            <p>SHALL I be allowed a few words to this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable audience in general,</p>
            <p>FRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS,</p>
            <p>THROUGH the infinite goodneſs of God, we as ſubjects of America, enjoy the precious jewel of liberty, which is of more worth than mountains of gold. How doth it become us to adore and praiſe that God who has exalted us in privileges above any other nation in the world. It we
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:024126_0036_0FC3B63238C6E598"/>
would have theſe bleſſings perpetuated to us, let us make it our chief concern to walk worthy of them. Let us examine our own hearts, whether we love the perfect ſyſtem of ihe divine govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and delight in ſubjection to it. The more we are ſubjected to this perfect rule of righit, the better we ſhall be qualified to perform the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous duties we owe to God and our fellow man.</p>
            <p>BUT if we live and die enemies to God, by wicked works, although we may here enjoy na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural liberty, yea we muſt go at laſt to the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful confines of eternal darkneſs and deſpair. But if we live the life we now live in the fleſh, by the faiht the Son of God, we ſhall receive that grace, through his worthineſs, whereby we may perſeve in well doing, unto eternal life and lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty above.</p>
            <p>LET US then ſtrive to fill up our remaining moments, in love to God and man, and in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ihe examples and precepts of our divine redeemer. And as virtue is of ſo great neceſſity for civil rulers, let us not ſacrifice our country and privileges, either by inattention to whom we elect from one time to another, to rule over us, or by knowingly appointing ſuch as have not a regard to religion and virtue. Let us alſo yield due ſubmiſſion to magiſtracy as an ordinance of God. Rendering honor to whom honor is due—and fear to whom tear.</p>
