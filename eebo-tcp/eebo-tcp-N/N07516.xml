            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE PAXTON RIOT (as it is called) makes ſo great a Noiſe, and is ſo much the general Topick, that a Man muſt be but little in Converſation, without having his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion aſk'd concerning this Affair.—In Truth, Matters are now come to ſuch a Paſs, that ſome People are of Opinion, that an Endeavour to make them worſe may probably be the Way to make them better. Reſentment rages high, and gathers thick from every Quarter; and where it will ſtop, I muſt leave to thoſe that have more <hi>Light within them,</hi> than I can boaſt of, to determine.</p>

            <p>Whoever will examine the Proceedings and Debates of Parliament, eſpecially thoſe in the Year 1737, will find the Sentiments of the wiſeſt and braveſt People under Heaven, concerning Tumults and Riots.—As theſe Things were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into the Debates of that Seſſion, I ſhall trouble you with a few Extracts of the Speeches on that Occaſion.</p>
            <p>Lord C—T declared himſelf thus—<q>The People (ſays he) ſeldom or never aſſemble in any riotous or tumultuous Manner, unleſs when they are oppreſſed, or at leaſt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine they are oppreſſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If the People ſhould be miſtaken, and imagine they are oppreſſed, when they are not, it is the Duty of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to endeavour firſt to correct their Miſtake by fair Means and juſt Reaſoning; in common Humanity he is obliged to take this Method, before he has Recourſe to ſuch Methods as may bring <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Deſtruction</hi> upon a great Number of his Fellow-Countrymen; and this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod will generally prevail, where they have not met with any real Oppreſſion: But when this happens to be the Caſe, it cannot be expected that they will give Ear to their Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor; nor can the ſevereſt Laws, nor the moſt rigorous Execution of thoſe Laws, always prevent the People's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming tumultuous:—You may ſhoot them—You may hang them—But till the Oppreſſion is removed or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviated, they will never be quiet, till the greateſt Part of them are deſtroyed. The only effectual Method to ſuppreſs Tumults will be, to enquire into the Cauſes, and to take ſuch Meaſures as may be proper for removing thoſe Cauſes: For in the <hi>Body Political,</hi> as in the <hi>Body Natural,</hi> while the Cauſe remains, it is impoſſible to remove the Diſtemper.</q>
            </p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:009594_0014_0F76DC65DFE880B8"/>
Lord B—ST ſpoke to this Effect—<q>The chief End of a Parliamentary Enquiry is not to <hi>diſcover</hi> or to <hi>puniſh</hi> the Perſons concerned in any Tumult; it is the Conduct of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> that we are principally to enquire into; and if upon ſuch Enquiry, it ſhould appear, that the Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult was occaſioned by any unjuſt or <hi>Oppreſſive Conduct,</hi> or by <hi>Negligence</hi> and <hi>Indolence,</hi>
               </q> we ought to cenſure or to puniſh ſuch a Magiſtrate—Such an Enquiry, and ſuch an Iſſue on <q>Enquiry, will ſatisfy the People, it will remove the Cauſe of Tumults, and conſequently will prevent them for the future: Whereas if we employ ourſelves ſolely in diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and puniſhing the Rioters, we do not remove but encreaſe the Cauſe of Tumults;—we ſhall make the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more diſcontented than they are—The Severity of the Puniſhment may ſear up the Wound for a Time, but it will not be healed; it will feſter, and endanger the total Diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Political Body.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>By theſe Kind of Proceedings (ſays another noble Lord) we may for a While keep the People quiet, or knock out the Brains of thoſe who ſhall preſume to be otherwiſe; but we ſhall never remove their Diſcontents, or gain their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and this muſt be done, or our Government muſt be made Arbitrary; for a free Government cannot be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported but by having the Affections of the Generality of the People.</q>

            <p>Now, Sir, had your Quakers, thoſe <hi>Children of Peace,</hi> adopted theſe wiſe Sentiments, and purſued theſe humane juſt and truly politic Meaſures, every Thing might have been eaſy.

But if they were all innocent, by what Law are we obliged to maintain 140 idle Vagabonds? Muſt <hi>Pennſylvania</hi> work for murdering Savages as their Lords and Maſters?</p>

But in the Name of Wonder! What could be meant by all theſe warlike Preparations? Surely the Quakers did not intend to make Uſe of <hi>Muſquetry</hi> and <hi>Cannon</hi> too, in caſe the <hi>Rioters</hi> had proceeded! If they did, they muſt either be very ignorant or very deſperate and cruel—It has often been declared in Parliament, That <q>the Liberty of Firing at Random, upon any Multitude of his Majeſty's Subjects, is a Liberty which ought to be moſt cautiouſly granted; and never made uſe of but in Caſes of the moſt abſolute Neceſſity—And in this Way of thinking (ſays one of the great Speakers upon the Subject) I am ſupported by the whole Tenor of the Laws of England—It is now 2 or 300 Years ſince <hi>Fire-Arms</hi> came in Uſe amongſt Us, yet the Law has never ſuffered them to be made Uſe of by the common Officers of Juſtice—Pikes, Halberts, Battle-Axes, and ſuch like, are the only Weapons that can be made Uſe of according to Law by ſuch Officers.—It it well known that by a late Statute, which is in Force in <hi>Scotland</hi> as well as in <hi>England;</hi> the Power of the Civil Magiſtrate, in the Caſes of any Mob or riotous Aſſembly, is fully and diſtinctly regulated; yet even by that Law (which I have often heard complained of as a Law not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable in a free Country) there is no expreſs Order given to the Magiſtrate or his Aſſiſtants, to make Uſe of <hi>Fire-Arms;</hi> ſo cautious was the Legiſlature of giving a legal Authority for making uſe of ſuch Weapons.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I know it will be ſaid that Officers of juſtice and their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtants, eſpecially his Majeſty's Troops, when they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be called to the Aſſiſtance of the Civil Magiſtrate, are in a very unlucky Situation, if they are not allowed to make uſe of the Arms in their Hands to prevent their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing knocked on the Head—Their Situation, I ſhall readily grant, may be unlucky enough; but we are to conſider the Law as it ſtands; and as the Law ſtands in <hi>England</hi> as well as in <hi>Scotland,</hi> if a Perſon ſuffers Death by <hi>firing,</hi> the Perſon that fired, and he who gave him Orders to fire, might both be proſecuted for <hi>Murder;</hi> and I am afraid neither of them would have any Reſourſe, but in the King's Mercy.—The Soldiers may upon ſuch Occaſions make Uſe of their ſcrew'd Bayonets, for diſperſing or ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

            </p>
            <p>Such was the Senſe of the greateſt Men in England, and ſuch the Caution and Lenity of a Britiſh Parliament.</p>
            <p>But what will the World ſay, or Poſterity think of your meek and peaceable Quakers, who thro' pretended Scruples againſt Reſiſtance! thro' Obſtinacy and Love of worldly Power, which they themſelves would neither ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Ends for which it ought to be uſed, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign into the Hands of thoſe that would; who have ſo long ſuffer'd the Province to bleed beneath the <hi>Savage Knife,</hi> its faireſt and moſt fruitful Fields to be deluged in Gore, and laid waſte and deſolate by <hi>Barbarian Spoilers!</hi> when they have been frequently ſupplicated, entreated and conjured, by all the ties of brotherly Love, Friendſhip, Humanity and Juſtice, to conſider the Miſery and Diſtraction of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try —but could never be prevailed upon to ſtand up in its Defence, or to uſe proper Means to reſcue it from theſe ſad Calamities: Yet have lately appeared with Arms and all the <hi>dread Machinery of War,</hi> to fight their beggar'd, ruined, miſerable Fellow Subjects; and to afford that Protection to their cruel Enemies and Murderers, which their Unhappy Countrymen, in their moſt deplora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Circumſtances, could never obtain from them?—O ungenerous, unfeeling Men! Was this the way to treat a ruined, deſparing People?—Will not Religion, Reaſon, Humanity, Juſtice, Charity, anſwer No?—Who was it that reduc'd them to the diſagreable Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of proceeding in the Manner they did?—From what Source are they to derive their Miſery? and, Who was it that provok'd and moved them to Reſentment? Who is it that has made them Rioters, and then Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, and deſires they may be <hi>Shot</hi> or <hi>Hang'd</hi> for being ſo? Who is it that has thrown ſo many Obſtacles in the Way of their Protection and Security?

and puniſh them? Theſe are Queſtions which every Body, with a Moments Reflection, may anſwer.</p>
            <p>A mighty Noiſe and Hubbub has been made about kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a few Indians in Lancaſter-County; and even <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> and <hi>Legiſlators</hi> have been employed to raiſe the Holloo upon thoſe that killed them; and to ranſack <hi>Tomes</hi> and <hi>Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems,</hi> Writers ancient and modern, for Proofs of their Guilt and Condemnation! And what have they proved at laſt? Why, that the WHITE SAVAGES of <hi>Paxton</hi> and <hi>Donnegall</hi> have violated the Laws of Hoſpitality! I can ſincerely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the ingenious and worthy Author of the NARRATIVE, that a Shock of <hi>Electricity</hi> would have had a much more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Effect upon theſe People than all the Arguments and Quotations he has produced.</p>
            <p>For my own Part, I utterly abhor and diſclaim every Act and Species of Cruelty, and I do ſolemnly declare, that I diſapprove of the Manner of killing the Indians in <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> as it was a Kind of Inſult to the Civil Magiſtrates, and an Encroachment upon the Peace and Quiet of that Town; and I wiſh that the <hi>Women</hi> and <hi>little Ones</hi> at leaſt, could have been ſpared.—But no doubt the Actors in that Affair, thought with <hi>Friend Biſhop,</hi> whom I quoted before, that the beſt Way was, while their Hands were in, to <hi>kill all,</hi>

The Public are alſo informed, that <q>The Magiſtrates of Lancaſter ſent to collect the remaining <hi>Indians,</hi>—brought them into the Town, comforted and promiſed them Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</q>—</p>
            <p>If they did this, they muſt be very ſilly indeed—For how was it poſſible for Men deſtitute of a MILITIA, without Men, Arms, or Ammunition to protect them?— But I am credibly informed that the Truth of the Matter was,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:009594_0020_0F76DC6A70619308"/>
That theſe Magiſtrates being apprehenſive of the Danger of the Indians, were very deſirous to have them removed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> as a Place of much greater Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity—through which Neglect to remove thither they muſt have

loſt their Lives, and not through any Miſconduct of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates—For it ſeems the Affair was accompliſh'd ſo unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly and ſuddenly, that not one Half of the Magiſtrates knew any Thing of the Matter till they were all kill'd; and thoſe that did, could do nothing, unleſs it was to go at the Peril of their Lives, among an enraged and armed Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and attack them with <hi>Stones</hi> and <hi>Brickbats.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have indeed heard it alledged againſt thoſe Magiſtrates, that there were ſome <hi>Soldiers</hi> in the Place, which they might have called to their Aſſiſtance— But I have heard it poſitively declared, by many of the Inhabitants of that Town, who were Eye-witneſſes of the whole Tranſaction, that if there were <hi>Ten Thouſand Soldiers</hi> diſpers'd and ſtrolling about in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that theſe were at the Time, it would have been impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have got them to their Arms, and properly drawn up, before the Indians were killed; ſo dextrous and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious were the PAXTONIANS in executing their Purpoſe.</p>

was a Breach of the Rites of <hi>Hoſpitality, which, Heathens, Turks, Saracens, Moors, Negroes</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> have held more ſacred than the PAXTONIANS. The Author here proſtitutes his own good Senſe, and contrary to the known Rules of Logic and ſound Reaſon, draws an univerſal Concluſion from particular Premiſes: As well might he argue that <hi>Goliah</hi> was a Giant, and ſo were all the Soldiers in the Army of the <hi>Philiſtines;</hi> or <hi>David</hi> ſpared <hi>Saul</hi> aſleep in the Cave, and therefore he ſpared all his Enemies.</p>
            <p>Would the Limits I have preſcribed to myſelf in this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter allow me, I could eaſily ſhew you, that every one of thoſe Nations have, in a Thousand Inſtances, violated the Laws of Hoſpitality, and Faith too, in a much higher Degree than theſe People could poſſibly have been guilty of.—But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out carrying you through <hi>Homer,</hi> old <hi>Legends,</hi> and <hi>fabulous Travels</hi> and <hi>Voyages—</hi> if you look into your <hi>Bible,</hi> you will find a very notable inſtance, which will ſet this Matter right.—We read in the 4th Chapter of <hi>Judges,</hi> that when <hi>Iſrael</hi> was ſold into the Hands of <hi>Jabin,</hi> King of <hi>Canaan,</hi> the Captain of whoſe Army was <hi>Siſera,</hi> who had nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Chariots of Iron, and had mightily oppreſſed the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael for 20 Years; the Lord at laſt, by his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak,</hi> delivered <hi>Iſrael</hi> from <hi>Jabin</hi> and <hi>Siſera.</hi>—<q>And the Lord diſcomfited <hi>Siſera,</hi> and all his Chariots, and all his Hoſt with the Edge of the Sword, before <hi>Barak;</hi> ſo that <hi>Siſera</hi> lighted down off his Chariot, and fled away on his Feet, to the Tent of <hi>Jael,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Heber</hi> the <hi>Kenite:</hi> For there was Peace between Jabin the King of Hazor, and the Houſe of <hi>Heber</hi> the <hi>Kenite.</hi>

            <q>
               <p>And he ſaid unto her, give me, I pray thee, a little Water to drink, for I am thirſty; and ſhe opened a Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Mil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Again he ſaid unto her, ſtand in the Door of the Tent, and it ſhall be when any Man doth come and enquire of thee and ſay, Is there any Man here? that thou ſhall ſay, No.</p>

Then <hi>Jael, Heber</hi>'s Wife, took a Nail of the Tent, and took an Hammer in her Hand, and went ſoftly unto him, and ſmote the Nail in his Temples, and faſtened it into the Ground; (for he was faſt aſleep and weary) ſo he died.</p>

            <p>Now was this Action (which has every Appearance of Cruelty in it) deemed a Breach of Faith, or a Violation of the Rites of Hoſpitality?

               <p>She put her Hand to the Nail, and her right Hand to the Workman's Hammer; and with the Hammer ſhe ſmote <hi>Siſera,</hi> ſhe ſmote off his Head, when ſhe had pierced and ſtri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>At her Feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down, there he lay down dead.</p>
            </q>
            <p>In the <hi>Apocrypha,</hi> we have another Inſtance no leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable than the above—We find that <hi>Judith</hi> killed <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lofernes</hi> even deceitfully, when it could be done no other Way.—<hi>Holofernes</hi> was the chief Captain of the Army of <hi>Aſſur,</hi> who made War againſt <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and when he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out againſt them, he threaten'd in theſe Words;—<q>I will go forth in my Wrath, and will cover the whole Earth with the Feet of my Army, and I will give them for a Spoil unto them:—So that their Slain ſhall fill their Valleys and Brooks, and the River ſhall be filled with their Dead, till it overflow—And I will lead them Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to the utmoſt Parts of the Earth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>Judith,</hi> a Widow, of whom it was ſaid—<q>There was none that gave her an ill Word; for ſhe feared GOD greatly</q>— I ſay, this good Woman, having humbled herſelf, and prayed to God to proſper her Purpoſe, went over to the Camp of the Enemy; and being taken by the Watch and conducted to <hi>Holofernes,</hi> ſhe declared to him that ſhe had fled from her own Nation—<q>Now therefore, my
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:009594_0027_0F76DC705B48A268"/>
Lord, (ſays ſhe) I will remain with thee, and thy Servant will go out by Night into the Valley, and I will pray unto God, and he will tell me when they have committed their Sins.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>And I will come and ſhew it unto thee: Then thou ſhalt go forth with all thine Army, and there ſhall be none of them that ſhall reſiſt thee.</p>
               <p>And I will lead thee through the Midſt of <hi>Judea,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til thou come before <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and I will ſet thy Throne in the Midſt thereof, and thou ſhalt drive them as Sheep that have no Shepherd, and a Dog ſhall not ſo much as open his Mouth at thee.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Yet notwithſtanding theſe Declarations we find that when ſhe was left alone in the Tent, and found <hi>Holofernes</hi> drunk, and lying upon his Bed—<q>She came to the Pillar of the Bed which was at <hi>Holofernes'</hi> Head, and took down his Faulchion from thence, and approached to his Bed, and took hold of the Hair of his Head, and ſaid, Strengthen me, O Lord God of Iſrael, this Day. And ſhe ſmote twice upon his Neck with all her Might, and ſhe took away his Head from him.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which Ozias ſaid unto her, <q>O Daughter, bleſſed art thou of the moſt high God, above all the Women upon the Earth; and bleſſed be the Lord God, which hath created the Heavens and the Earth, which hath di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected thee to the cutting off the Head of the Chief of our Enemies.</q>
            </p>

               <q>And God turn theſe Things to thee for a perpetual Praiſe, to viſit thee in good Things, becauſe thou haſt not ſpared thy Life for the Affiliction of our Nation, but haſt revenged our Ruin, walking a ſtraight Way before our God. And all the People ſaid, So be it, So be it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But no doubt it will be objected here, that theſe were not <hi>Chriſtians</hi>— And perhaps I might be challeng'd to produce an Example from any <hi>"civiliz'd Nation in Europe"</hi>—Left you ſhould be prevailed upon to believe that it was not in my Power to anſwer ſuch a Challenge, I ſhall give you an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the horrid Cruelty and Inhumanity of a <hi>civilized Nation,</hi> whoſe Honour and Hoſpitality the Author of the <hi>Narrative</hi> has taken great Pains to applaud and extol; and

            <p>In the Year 1746, or 1747, a <hi>Spaniſh Privateer</hi> entered the River <hi>Delaware,</hi> and proceeded almoſt up to <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> The Crew went on Shore, and plundered two or more Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations—On their Return they met with, and attacked, an Engliſh Ship commanded by Captain <hi>Brown,</hi> who gallantly defended himſelf, till being overpowered, he was obliged at laſt to ſtrike and ſubmit; but the <hi>Spaniſh Officers</hi> were ſo exaſperated at the gallant and brave Defence he made, for which a generous and merciful Enemy would have eſteem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>What need I adduce any further Inſtances than theſe? If killing the Indians in <hi>Lancaſter</hi> County, was a Violation of the Laws of Faith and <hi>Hoſpitality,</hi> I muſt then declare it, as my Opinion, that every Nation under Heaven, have been guilty of this Crime in a much higher Degree than the <hi>Pax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton People,</hi> and with leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
