            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Chriſt Anſwers, <hi>It is I.</hi> In his Anſwer he gives a deſcription of himſelf. (1.) From his Fidelity: <hi>I that ſpeak in Righteouſneſs</hi>: What he ſpeaks, he does faithfully perform. He is always as good as his Word. He has promiſed Salvation to his People, and he does accompliſh it: He has threatned Deſtruction to his implacable Enemies, and he does accompliſh that alſo, and is <hi>Righteous</hi> therein. (2.)

Luk. 2.10, 11. <hi>The Angel ſaid, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all People, for unto you is born this day a Saviour which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> And there was a great Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Heavenly Hoſt, Praiſing God for it.

Moſes was a ſhadow of Chriſt. The ſhadow re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents the Body whoſe ſhadow it is, ſo in Moſes we ſee ſome Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Chriſt ſhadowed to us. He was a <hi>Deliverer,</hi> but not comparable to Chriſt. The <hi>Judges</hi> in Iſrael were Saviours, and on that account Types of Chriſt. In a ſpecial manner <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was ſo. <hi>Jacob</hi> in his dying Propheſy concerning the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> breaks forth into this Expreſſion, <hi>I have waited for thy Salvation, O Lord.</hi> Sampſon was of that Tribe, he was a Type of Chriſt,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001767_0022_0FB828385D165D88"/>
whoſe <hi>Salvation</hi> was that which the holy Patriarch waited &amp; longed for. <hi>Sampſon</hi> ſignifies a <hi>Little Sun</hi>: Chriſt is a great <hi>Sun</hi>: He is the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, that has healing (Salvation) under his Wings: He is <hi>the Light of the World.</hi> Sampſon ſaved his People with the loſs of his own Life: At and by his Death he Conquered more E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, than in all his Life.

Number of the Captives of Hell; He is a Saviour not only of Jews, but of Gentiles diſperſed throughout the World. Wherefore the Apoſtle ſays, 1 Joh. 2.2. <hi>He is a Propitiation for our ſins, and not for ours only.</hi> Not for ours only who are Jews, <hi>but alſo of the whole World;</hi> meaning the Gentile World: Great Numbers among the Jews have been ſaved by Chriſt: In the Apoſtles days, there were <hi>Myriads</hi> of them. Act. 21.20. <hi>Many thouſands of Jews believe</hi>: but far more thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of that People ſhall ere long believe on Chriſt, and ſo become the Subjects of his Salvation. It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by ſome Learned Men, that if the Jews which are ſcattered over the face of the whole Earth, were gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red together, they would be the moſt Numerous Nation in the World: but this Nation ſhall turn to the Lord, and then all Iſrael ſhall be Saved. But among the Gentiles Chriſt has had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

by him. And among the Gentiles alſo, there are whole Nations that ſhall ere long become Chriſts Subjects. He will be their King, and he will Save them. <hi>All the Ends of the World ſhall turn to the Lord.</hi> The Lord ſhall be King over all the Earth; <hi>In that day ſhall there be One Lord and his Name One,</hi> Zech. 14.9. Then all the World will ſee and know and believe that Jeſus Chriſt is a Mighty Saviour.

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:001767_0025_0FB8283F03729D38"/>5. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is a Saviour of Souls,</hi> and therefore a Mighty Saviour. He is called the <hi>Shepherd of Souls,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.25. Sin has brought death not only on the Bodies of Men, but on their Souls. Ezek. 18.4. <hi>The ſoul that ſinneth ſhall dy.</hi> And a woful death it is that Sin brings on the Souls of Men. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Soul does not dy a natural death as the Body does, but it may be a ſubject of great wo and miſery, and that's death. Iſal. 3.9. <hi>They declare their ſin as Sodom, wo to their ſoul.</hi> But Jeſus Chriſt ſaves both Soul &amp; Body. Who is able to redeem a Body that is dead from the Power of the Grave? Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God can do it, has done it, and will do it. Joh. 5.25. <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live.</hi> But to quicken and ſave a Soul that has been dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, is a Mightier work, than to raiſe all the dead Bodies in the World, yet this Jeſus Chriſt has Power to do.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001767_0026_0FB82840B42BFCD0"/>
Therefore he ſays, Iſai. 55.3. <hi>Come unto me, hear, and your ſouls ſhall live.</hi> Chriſt has redeemed Souls as well as Bodies by a <hi>Mighty Price.</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. <hi>You are bought with a price, therefore glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rify God in your body, and in your ſpirit.</hi> And what it that price, which has bought both Body and Spirit? It is the price of blood, and the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious blood that ever was, or that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly can be, the blood of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which is <hi>the blood of God.</hi> And as Chriſt has ſaved the Souls of his People by <hi>Price,</hi> ſo likewiſe by <hi>Power.</hi> His <hi>All-powerful Arm</hi> has vanquiſhed all the Powers of darkneſs. Col. 2.15. <hi>Having ſpoiled Principalities and Powers, he made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them.</hi> He has led Captivity Captive: He has diſ-armed the Devil and all his Angels and as it were tied them to his triumphal Chariot, and expoſed them openly in the ſight of Heaven and Earth: So has he ſet the Souls that were the Captives of Hell at Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. The Salvation of a Soul is a Mighty thing. It is ſo, conſidering
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001767_0027_0FB828424FD2EF10"/>
the worth of the Soul: One Soul is more worth than all this World. Has not Chriſt ſaid, <hi>What is a man profited, if he gain the whole World, and looſe his own ſoul? or; what ſhall a man give in exchange for his ſoul</hi>? Mat. 16.26. A Scripture which a Religious Man adviſed a King that he would think on it, a quarter of an hour every day, The Soul is of invaluable worth, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the Immortality of it. Every Man has a Mortal Body, and an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Soul: A body that muſt dy, and ſhall dy, and a Soul that ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dy. To Save ſuch a Soul is a Mightier thing than to ſave all the Bodies in the World. To redeem one Soul is ſuch a Mighty thing, as that all the Men on Earth, and all the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven cannot do it. Pſal. 49.8. <hi>The redemption of their ſoul is precious, and it ceaſeth for ever.</hi> But what a Mighty Saviour then is Jeſus Chriſt, who has Redeemed Thouſands of Millions of Precious and Immortal Souls?</p>

The Captives of the Mighty ſhall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible ones ſhall be delivered.</hi> Sinners are ſaid to be lawful Captives, in that the Juſtice of God had delivered them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of Satan, and his evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, who were <hi>terrible Ones.</hi> They had never been delivered from thoſe terrible Ones, nor the prey taken out of the hands of the Mighty, if Chriſt had not done it. <hi>Satan</hi> is a powerful Enemy; the Scripture ſpeaks of the power of that Enemy, <hi>Luk.</hi> 10.19.

him that had the power of death that is the Devil;</hi> not as to his Being, but as to his Dominion. We find in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, that Chriſt delivered many that were under bodily Poſſeſſion by De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, thereby declaring that he would deliver Souls that were under Spiritual Poſſeſſion by Evil Spirits. Spiritual Plagues are the greateſt, therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from them is a <hi>Mighty Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Blindneſs of Mind is a Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Judgment.

For one that is blind to have his ſight reſtored to him is a Mighty thing eſpecially if he was born blind. Joh. 9.32. <hi>Since the World began was it not heard, that any man opened the Eyes of one that was born blind</hi>: But Chriſt has opened the Eyes of many a one that was born blind; that came into the World with a dark Soul. To give ſight to a dark Soul, is a greater thing than to reſtore ſight to a dark Body:

This is that which Sinners are condemned unto. If it had not been for Jeſus Chriſt, no Sinner in the World had been delivered from that terrible death: But Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God has ſaved a World of Periſhing Souls from it. Joh. 3.17. <hi>God ſent not his ſon into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved.</hi> The moſt formidable Thing that can poſſibly be thought on, is the Wrath of the Infinite God. Who can ſave from it? It is too mighty for any Creature in Heaven or Earth to undertake. Who can quench that Devouring Fire? Chriſt has done it with his own Blood. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Juſtified by his Blood, we ſhall he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from Wrath through him,</hi> Rom 5.9.

And this He does by ſaving from Sin.

Chriſt by ſaving from Sin, has ſaved from Wrath, and from all the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful direful Effects of that Wrath. Sin is the greateſt Evil.

                  <hi>IT is a dangerous and a deſtructive Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror for Men to ſeek Salvation in whole or in part in any thing beſides Chriſt.</hi> And yet thus it is with a World of People. Wherefore the Prophet ſays, <hi>All People will walk every one in the Name of his God,</hi> Mic 4.5. To walk in the Name of God is to Pray to him, and depend on him for Salvation. There is an abundance of People that do ſo, but the God they put their truſt in is an Idol that cannot ſave. This has been the practice of the Nations of the Earth generally. Thence it is that the greateſt part of the Children of Men, yea, whole Nations of them are in a periſhing condition. Pſal. 9.17. <hi>The wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all the Nation, that forget God.</hi> Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation they would have, and Salvation

they hope for, but in vain becauſe they hope for it without Chriſt. Jer. 3.23. <hi>Truly in vain is ſalvation hoped for from the hills and from the mountains.</hi> They worſhipped their Idols on the Hills and on the Mountains; thoſe Idols were not Chriſt, and therefore in vain was Salvation hoped for from them. There are many in the World that never heard of Chriſt: How ſhould ſuch depend on him for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Rom. 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed, and how ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard, and how ſhall they hear without a preacher.</hi> A very great part of the Nations in the World, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had a <hi>Preacher of Chriſt</hi> among them. And many that have heard of him do not believe on him. Rom. 10.16. <hi>They have not all obeyed the Goſpel, for Iſaias ſaith, who has believed our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi>? The Jews do not believe that Chriſt is Chriſt, that <hi>Jeſus</hi> of Nazareth is the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah</hi>; He came to them and offered himſelf to them to be their Saviour, but as the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001767_0043_0FB835E7EB278BE0"/>
foretold that they would do, they deſpiſed and rejected him. Joh. 1.11. <hi>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</hi> They would be their own Saviours, they thought by a righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of their own to ſave them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but therefore Salvation they never obtained, nor was it poſſible they ſhould without Chriſt, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Faith in him. <hi>They attained not Righteouſneſs,</hi> they were not Juſtified: why? <hi>becauſe they ſought it not by Faith, but as it were by the works of the Law,</hi> Rom. 9.32. And there are many who own Chriſt to be their Saviour, but then they joyn other Saviours with him, as if this <hi>Mighty Saviour</hi> were not able to ſave them himſelf alone Chriſt ſayes in the Context before us; Iſai. 63.3. <hi>I have troden the wine preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me.</hi> They then who expect Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on partly from Chriſt, and partly from ſomething elſe, will be diſappointed in their Expectation. Such Chriſtians are too like the <hi>Samaritans</hi> of old, of whom it is ſaid, that they <hi>Feared the
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001767_0044_0FB835EA77C62ED8"/>
Lord, and ſerved graven Images.</hi> All <hi>Papiſts</hi> are ſuch. They pretend that they hope for Salvation by Chriſt, yet they Pray for Salvation to this and the other Saint, to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> or St. <hi>Paul,</hi> more often than they do to Chriſt Himſelf: nay, to fictitious Saints of their own ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king. The Pope will Canonize them, and the deluded People will Pray to them, though it may be they were wicked men, and their Souls now in Hell. Yea, they make a Crucifix their Saviour: They ſay of a Croſs, <hi>Vnica ſpes, ſaluſque noſtra,</hi> thou art our only hope &amp; ſalvation. And among thoſe that are called <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> many build their hopes of Salvation on other things beſides Chriſt. It may be on ſome righteouſneſs of their own. Nothing i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> more natural nor more dangerous than to do ſo. Thus it was with <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion: He was touching the righteouſneſs of the Law blameleſs. A Man <hi>Zealous for the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi> of Moſes Law, and free from any Scandalous Immorality, and <hi>thoſe things

he accounted gain,</hi> Phil. 3.7. He made account that by this Righteouſneſs he ſhould gain Heaven. Is it not thus with many that go under the Name of Chriſtians! Ask them a reaſon of their hope, they will preſently ſay as the Phariſee did, I thank God I am not as many other men are, Extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, Unjuſt, Adulterers; and this Morality they depend upon for Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, eſpecially if with a Sober Life they practiſe Religious Duties, they Pray and it may be Faſt often; this form of Godlineſs they doubt not will ſave them. They Pray to God, they Read the Scripture, they Hear Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Publick Aſſemblies, they go to Private Meetings. All this is well done: But is Prayer, Chriſt? Is Reading &amp; Hearing the Word, Chriſt? Are Private Meetings Chriſt? Again, ſome build their hopes of Salvation on thoſe Spiritual Priviledges which they are the Subjects of. <hi>They are baughty becauſe of the holy mountain,</hi> Zech. 3.11. They are Church-Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Baptiſed, admitted to the Lords

Yet again, there are who think that becauſe they are the Children of Godly Parents, and many Prayers have been made for them, that therefore they muſt needs be ſaved. But are thy Parents, Chriſt? or are their Prayers, Chriſt? The Jews had no words in their Mouths more frequently than <hi>Abraham Abinu,</hi> that is, Abraham is our Father: They ſet up <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Place, hoping to be ſaved becauſe of their Relation to, and deſcent from that holy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> endeavoured to Convince them of this their fatal Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Mat. 3.9. <hi>Think not to ſay within your ſelves we have Abraham to our Father.</hi>

but it proved his own ruin. That <hi>Mighty Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who ſaveth his People with an <hi>Eternal Salvation,</hi> is eaſily able to accompliſh <hi>Temporal Salvations</hi> for them, when and ſo far as he pleaſeth. Oft-times he has done ſo when his People have been reduced to the greateſt extremity. When he ſees that their Power is gone, and there is none ſhut up and left to be a Delieverer for them, his own Arm brings Salvation. When it is with them as it was with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Knife was juſt made ready to cut his Throat, then the Angel called out of Heaven, <hi>Hold thy hand,</hi> Gen. 22.11, 12. Chriſt was that Angel. <hi>In the Mount, the Lord will be ſeen.</hi> When his People are brought into a Mount of the greateſt difficulty and danger, then it will be ſeen what God can do, and will do for them. It has been Chriſts uſual way, to ſave his People by ſuch means, and at ſuch a time as they leaſt expected it. So when he brought them out of Aegypt, the Mountains did flow at his Preſence, and he did
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:001767_0057_0FB83605743EF448"/>
terrible things which they looked not for. In ſpecial when they were at the Red Sea, rocky Mountains were on each ſide of them, which they could not poſſibly go over. <hi>Pharoah</hi> with a bloody Army was behind them. The Jewiſh Hiſtorians relate, that there was Fifty Thouſand Horſe, and Two Hundred Thouſand Foot in that Army. The Sea was before them. Now Chriſt appears in this Extremity. The <hi>Angel of God</hi> ſteps in between Iſrael and the Aegyptians, and wrought a Miraculous Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. That Angel was Chriſt. The Lords People in Babylon, ſaid, we are cut off, our hope is loſt; then did Chriſt open their Graves, and caus'd them to come out of their Graves. And thus it has been with the Chriſtian Church. The Emperor <hi>Diocleſian</hi> raiſed the greateſt Perſecution againſt Chriſtians that ever was known, he endeavoured, and thought it was done, to have all the Bibles in the World Burned. He cauſed a Pillar to be Erected with that Inſcription,

Of this I conceive the Scripture ſpeaks, Rev. 12.10. <hi>Now is come Salvation, and Strength, &amp; the Kingdom of our God, and the Power of his Chriſt.</hi> But thoſe <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable dayes</hi> for the Church were ſoon ended, and a very dark time quickly followed. <hi>Arianiſme</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm</hi> has overwhelmed the Church, and covered it with worſe than Aegyptian Darkneſs.

Would to God it were ſo; But alas! many call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians, whom Chriſt will not own for ſuch another day. Mat. 7.21. <hi>Not every one that ſayeth unto me, Lord, Lord, ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven; many will ſay have we not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied in thy name, and then will I profeſs unto them, I never knew you.</hi> Moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it is:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That there are but few in the World that have a true ſaving juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Faith. Rom. 10.16. <hi>Who has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved our report.</hi> Among thoſe that enjoy the Goſpel, who has believed? Among thoſe that have Chriſt Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, who has believed? Faith is a rare Grace. Old <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that of the Chriſtians under his
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001767_0068_0FB8361C5B6D60A8"/>
inſpection, not one of an Hundred was a true Believer. But they that are <hi>Faithleſs</hi> are <hi>Chriſtleſs.</hi> For <hi>Chriſt dwells in the heart by Faith,</hi> Eph. 3.17. Nor is it every kind of Faith that gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth an Intereſt in him. It is not an Hiſtorical, or meer Doctrinal Faith, but a Faith that is attended with O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that is ſaving. Jam. 2.14. <hi>What does it profit my brethren, though a man ſay he has faith,</hi> he does but ſay ſo, the thing is not true, <hi>and have no works, can faith ſave him</hi>? No, ſuch a Faith can never ſave him. A true ſaving Faith is a working Faith. It works by Love. By Love to Chriſt, and Love to his People, and Love to all his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As for ſuch as live ungodly lives, Chriſt will not be their Saviour, if they go on in their ſins. Chriſt came to ſave his People <hi>from</hi> their ſins, not to ſave them with or <hi>in</hi> their ſins. Let every one that names the Name of Chriſt depart from iniquity. There are Men that call themſelves Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that live ſuch wicked lives, that
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001767_0069_0FB8361F269D6810"/>
Chriſt eſteems them a diſhonour to his Name. They bring a reproach on his Name. Some of the Ancients tell us, that Pagans in their dayes, would ſay, If Chriſt was a good God, they that call themſelves Chriſtians would not be ſuch wicked Men, as we ſee many of them are. So tis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported of the Indians, that they would not believe that Chriſt was a good God, becauſe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to Worſhip him were the worſt of Men. Alas many that call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Chriſtians are voluptuous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſcandalous Worldlings. Phil. 3.18, 19. <hi>For many walk, of whom I have told you often, that they are enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whoſe God is their belly, and whoſe glory is in their ſhame, who mind earthly things.</hi> There are among pretended Chriſtians, thoſe that indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſome in one Luſt, ſome in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſome in Luſts of the Fleſh, others in Luſts of the Mind. Chriſt will own and ſave none of them at the laſt Day. <hi>But he will ſay, I tell you, I know you not
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:001767_0070_0FB83621C73E04E8"/>
whence you are, depart from me all ye that work iniquity,</hi> Luk. 13.27. He will ſay to one, thou waſt a Drunkard, thou waſt a worker of Iniquity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me; He will ſay to another, thy life was among the Unclean, thou art a worker of Iniquity, depart from me; He will ſay to another, thou waſt given to Lying, thou didſt love and make a Lye, thou art a worker of Iniquity, depart from me. Oh that Sinners would think ſadly of this, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they muſt depart from all their Iniquities, or Chriſt will ſay to them at the Great Day, depart from me.</p>
               <p n="3">3. They that live in diſobedience to the known Commandments of Chriſt, have not an Intereſt in him. It is in vain for ſuch to think, that this <hi>Mighty Saviour</hi> will ſave them. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſayes, that <hi>He is the Author of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſalvation to all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.9. Then he will not be the Author of Salvation to them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in their diſobedience to him. What then will become of Prophane Sinners, that go on in their Trepaſſes?
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001767_0071_0FB83623C3C3E5D0"/>
Does not Chriſt in his Word ſay, Swear not at all? How then can any profane Swearer think that Chriſt will ſave him? Does not Chriſt in his Word ſay, Bleſs and Curſe not? How then can they who in their rage will Curſe and Damn themſelves and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, think that Chriſt will ſave them from Damnation? And ſins of <hi>Omiſſion,</hi> contrary to the expreſs commandment of Chriſt, may hinder Salvation as well as ſins of <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> Now ſay, has not Chriſt poſitively commanded Men to Pray in Secret? Mat. 6.6. <hi>When thou prayeſt enter into thy cloſet, and when thou haſt ſhut the door, pray to thy Father which is in ſecret.</hi> It may be the hour is yet to come, the day is yet to dawn, when thou haſt done ſo.

Two Reaſons may be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, why ſome of the Elect of God are Converted in their Youth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe ſome of them dye in
their Youth. Therefore they muſt either be Converted in their Youth, or not at all. For there is no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion after Death, ſince every Mans Eternal State is then determin'd. <hi>After Death comes Judgment,</hi> Heb. 9.27. The Immortal Soul then returns to God that gave it, and is accordingly adjudged to its Everlaſting State. Some that dye in their Youth, go to Heaven when they leave this World.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:001767_0084_0FB83641A5F27270"/>
Now the Glory of Heaven is begun in Grace. Without holineſs none ſhall ſee the Lord. Wherefore it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that Regenerating Grace ſhould be wrought in them, in their young Years. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> tho' a very wicked Man had a Son which was a godly Child: 2 King. 14.13. <hi>In him there was found ſome good thing towards the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> In the 17th verſe, 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Child dyed</hi>: Since he was to dye when a Child, it was neceſſary that <hi>a Good Thing,</hi> that Grace ſhould be found in him before Death took him out of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some of the Elect of God are in his Eternal Purpoſe deſigned to do great Service for his Name. Moſt of thoſe mentioned in the Scripture as Converted in their Youth, were in their Generation ſingular Inſtruments of Gods Glory, and of doing Service for his Name. That ſo Men may do Service for God, it is ordinarily requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite that they ſhould have an unblemiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Youth. Otherwiſe it is like to be with them as was Propheſied concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:001767_0085_0FB83645D41C1A10"/>
               <hi>Reuben,</hi> when his Youth had been blemiſhed with an Inceſtuous Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Gen. 49.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt not excell, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,</hi> &amp;c. Such Sinners upon their true Repentance ſhall have their Sins forgiven and their Souls Saved: but tho' they ſhall go to Heaven they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <hi>excell</hi> on Earth. Scandalous Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages will be a laſting wound to a Mans Reputation. Wherefore God ordinarily when he deſigns a Perſon for ſpecial Service, ſeizeth him for himſelf whileſt he is Young. It is true, that <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion had been a great Sinner; and yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards the moſt Serviceable Man in the World. But altho' he was a great Unbeliever and Perſecutor, he was not guilty of ſuch Sins as blemiſh a Mans Reputation in the eſteem of the World. He was a very blameleſs Perſon. It is a very great Mercy to have an unblemiſhed Youth; for that Scandalous Miſcarriages in Youth, will ſtick upon a Man all his days after. Now if a Man has Grace wrought in his Soul whileſt it is Early dayes with
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:001767_0086_0FB83646E726C038"/>
him, that will be a bleſſed means to preſerve him from an unblemiſhed Youth. Again, That ſo a Man may do much Service for Chriſt he muſt have time allowed him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But how doſt thou know thou ſhalt live to <hi>Old Age</hi>? Where there is one that does ſo, there are many that do not. Have not Deaths been multiplied among Young Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? How many have you known as likely to live as you, but Death has cut them off Some godly ones dye in Youth, but far more ungodly ones. Job 36.14. <hi>They dye in youth, and their life is among the unclean.</hi> When Young Men are very Wicked, they provoke the Lord to ſhorten their days. Prov. 10.27. <hi>The fear of the Lord prolongs days, but the years of the wicked ſhall be ſhortened.</hi> Then be not Wicked overmuch for why ſhouldſt thou dye before thy time.

<pb n="86" facs="unknown:001767_0099_0FB82371AF6F5B38"/>
he that ſeeth into the Hearts of Men, knows when they are not ſincere. Pſal. 78.34. <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and inquired early after God. Nevertheleſs, they did flatter him with their mouths, and they lyed unto him with their tongue, for their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his covenant.</hi> Do we not often ſee it, that Sinners when they think they ſhall dye make great promiſes, that if God will ſpare their lives they will reform their Evil ways and yet after the Lord has mercifully ſpared them, they are as bad and worſe than ever before. Moreover, how doſt thou know that thou ſhalt lye on a Sick-Bed. It may be thou ſhalt be taken out of the World by a Sudden Death, and not have time to put up ſo much as One Prayer to God for the Pardon of thy ſins, and the Salvation of thy Soul.

The Martyr was troubled at him, and ſaid that Man did not Preach the Goſpel. The Goſpel offers Salvation to all Men, Old as well as Young, if any

will Repent and Believe. Since God Calls you ſtill, he will not refuſe you, no not the Oldeſt Sinner among you all, if you will turn to him with all your Heart. We read in the Goſpel concerning a poor Blind Man, that cryed to the Lord Jeſus to have Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy on him, Jeſus ſtood ſtill and commanded him to be called, and it was ſaid to the Blind Man, <hi>Be of good comfort, he calls thee,</hi> Mat. 10.49. So there is this Crevis of hope &amp; comfort left for thee, that haſt continued in thy ſins to Old Age, Behold, <hi>the Lord calls thee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Thy Time is limited to an Hour, yet <hi>if after ſo long a time</hi> of Diſobedience, you will <hi>this Day</hi> hearken to the Voice and Call of God, happy art thou, otherwiſe Everlaſtingly Miſerable. Think on that Scripture (Old &amp; Young think of it) with which I conclude.

World. Wherefore the Doctrine to be inſiſted on, is,
<q>
                  <hi>DOCT.</hi> That when Godly Men dye, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe them to be never ſo Poor in this World, their Souls do not dye, but are carried by holy Angels into another and a better World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctrine may be Opened and Confirmed in ſeveral <hi>Propoſitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>PROP. I. <hi>Every Man conſiſts of a Body and a Soul in reſpect of the one of which he is ſubject to Death, but not in reſpect of the other.</hi> Theſe are the two eſſential Parts of Man. It was ſo in the firſt Creation, and it is ſo ſtill. The firſt Man conſiſted of a Body and a Soul: Gen 2.7. <hi>The Lord God formed Man of the duſt of the Ground, &amp; breathed into his Noſtrils the breath of Life, &amp; Man became a living ſoul.</hi> Thus does every Man conſiſt of an humane Body, and a rational Soul. That Creature which does not ſo, is not one of Mankind. Math. 10, 28, <hi>Fear not them which kill
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:001767_0110_0FB823885993F940"/>
the body, but are not able to kill the ſoul, but rather fear him, which is able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy both ſoul and body in hell.</hi> Theſe two are of very differing nature and properties. The Body does incur the outward Senſes, but the Soul does not ſo. The Body may be ſeen and felt, but the Soul cannot be ſo; for it is a Spiritual ſubſtance. Chriſt ſaid to the Diſciples when he appeared to them after his Reſurrection, &amp; they thought he had been a Spirit, <hi>Handle me and ſee for a ſpirit has not fleſh &amp; bones as you ſee me have,</hi> Luk. 24.39. The <hi>Soul</hi> is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten called a <hi>Spirit.</hi> In the Scripture, Man, is diſtributed into <hi>Body and Soul,</hi> (as was ſhewed) and ſometimes into <hi>Body and Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.20. It is in reſpect of the Body that Men dye, which is therefore called your <hi>Mortal Body,</hi> Rom. 5.14. And that being an Eſſential Part of Man, he is called <hi>Mortal Man,</hi> Job 4.17. Its uſual a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Writers to call <hi>Men</hi> by the Name of <hi>Mortals.</hi> To dye is the fate of all the Men on the Earth.

               </gap> the light of Natural Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n dye with their Bodies. 1 Cor. 15.19. <hi>If in his life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable.</hi> If there is no life but this, the beſt Men would be the unhappieſt Men. What reaſonable Man can believe that to be ſo? Bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards are Promiſed to the Righteous; But in this life they ſee them not. <hi>There is one event to the Righteous and to the Wicked.</hi> Yea, many times they are ſubject to greater Miſeries than others, and that all their life long. The holy Penman of the Seventy third Pſalm, ſays, <hi>All the day long have I been plagued and chaſtened every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> Severe puniſhment is threatned, for thoſe that have been great Sinners.

Whenas many times they are not pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed in this World. The ungodly proſper in the World, they have more than heart can wiſh. From theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations the Philoſophers and Wiſe Men among the Gentiles, did believe the Immortality of the Soul, and that there is another World in which Good Men ſhall be Happy, and the Wicked Miſerable. <hi>Balaam</hi> was ſo far in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned as to believe this. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaid, <hi>Let me dye the Death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his,</hi> Numb. 23.10. He knew that when Righteous Men dye, their Souls do not dye, but that <hi>afterwards,</hi> (as the Original Hebrew imports,) after Death they are happy. And this has been the Faith of all Righteous Men. It is therefore ſaid, <hi>The righteous has hope in his Death,</hi> Prov. 14.32. He has hope of being made happy at and by his Death. The Martyr <hi>Stephen</hi> did not think that his Soul dyed with his Body, for then he would not when dying have ſaid, <hi>Lord Jeſus receive my ſpirit.</hi> The Faith of this, comforted

the Martyrs, when their Perſecutors threatened them with Death, they would ſay, kill our Bodies you may, but you ſhall never kill our Souls.</p>
            <p>PROP. II. <hi>When Godly Men dye, their Souls go to another and a better World.</hi> Their Souls go to that World where <hi>Abraham</hi> now is. When <hi>Lazarus</hi> died he was in <hi>Abrahams boſom.</hi> When Good Men die they are no ſooner dead as to their Bodies, but they are bleſſed in reſpect of their Souls. Rev. 14.13. <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord.</hi> When they are taken out of this World, they <hi>go to reſt,</hi> they reſt from their Labours, and their works follow them. This is implied by their lying in <hi>Abrahams boſom.</hi> When <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarus</hi> was dead, he was no more afflicted with poverty and pains. Saints de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted this Life, enjoy a perfect free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from all evils whatſoever. Then, and not till then, will that Promiſe be fulfilled, Jer. 31.12. <hi>They ſhall not ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row any more at all.</hi> And which is a greater happineſs, they are fully and
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:001767_0115_0FB823974A01F360"/>
forever freed from ſin. Rom. 6.7. <hi>He that is dead is freed from ſin.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore does the Scripture ſpeak of <hi>the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23. They go to a place where they have nothing but comfort. When <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead, it was ſaid of him, <hi>Now he is comforted.</hi> Altho' their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are not glorified before the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, their Souls are as ſoon as they leave their Bodies. When the Cloathing of Mortality is put off, a Cloathing of Glory is put on. 2 Cor. 5.2, 3, 4 <hi>For in this we groan earneſtly, deſiring to be cloathed upon with our houſe which is from heaven, if ſo be that being cloathed we ſhall not be found naked. We that are in this tabernacle groan being bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened, not for that we would be uncloathed, but cloathed upon, that mortality might be ſwallowed up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f life.</hi> Their Souls do not remain in a naked condition, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of a Cloathing of Fleſh, they have a Cloathing of Glory. It is ſaid concerning the <hi>Souls under the Altar,</hi> viz The Chriſtians that were Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyred in the Primitive times, that <hi>white
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:001767_0116_0FB82398E8BA4500"/>
robes were given to every one of them,</hi> Rev. 6.11. White Robes are an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Glory. When the Prieſts were admitted into the inner Courts, <hi>White Robes</hi> were given to them. Thus the departed Souls of Believers when they firſt enter into the Heavenly Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, <hi>Robes of Glory</hi> are given to them. They then go to a bleſſed place. To a place of which <hi>Paradiſe</hi> and the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Eden</hi> was a figure. It was a uſual Prayer with the Jews, for an Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite, <hi>Let his ſoul be in the Garden of, Eden.</hi> They ſay, when Abraham <hi>dyed he went to Paradiſe,</hi> and that when Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes dyed, <hi>he went to Paradiſe.</hi> This is true not only of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> but of all penitent Believers on Jeſus Chriſt. It was therefore ſaid to the Penitent on the Croſs, <hi>To day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> Luk. 23.43. When they leave this World, their Souls go to Heaven. The Scripture ſpeaks of ſome who <hi>Blaſpheme them that dwell in heaven,</hi> Rev. 13.6. <hi>Idolatry</hi> is called <hi>Blaſphemy.</hi> Papiſts worſhip Saints departed. They Pray to <hi>St.

Peter</hi> and <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and to the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi>; to make Gods of them is Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy. So do they Blaſpheme <hi>them that dwell in Heaven.</hi> We read of <hi>thing, in Heaven</hi> reconciled to God, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. The Elect Angels are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed things in Heaven, they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Angels of Heaven,</hi> that's their Native Country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But they never needed to be reconciled to God, as not having ſinned, nor did the Son of God ſhed his Blood for them.

Good Men at their departure out of this world, go where they have bleſſed Communion with thoſe holy Souls, which are gone to Heaven be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them. They go to <hi>Abraham</hi> as we have ſhewed. It was ſaid to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> that at his Death he ſhould <hi>go to his Fathers,</hi> Gen. 15.15. He went to that World where <hi>Shem</hi> and <hi>Noah</hi> and other of his Fathers were

gone before him. That ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which ſerved God as he had done, at the hour of his Death he was <hi>ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to them,</hi> Gen. 25.8. They go to be with Angels. God ſaid to the Prophet, <hi>If thou wilt walk in my ways, and keep my charge, I will give thee pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to walk among theſe that ſtand by,</hi> Zech. 3 7. Were they not <hi>Angels</hi> that ſtood by? When the faithful Servants of God, have finiſhed their work in this world, they go to be with Angels, and to walk with them in the walks of Heaven. They go to be <hi>with Chriſt.</hi> Phil. 1.23. <hi>I deſire to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part, and to be with Chriſt.</hi> They go to God. As long as they are in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, they are abſent from the Lord, but when <hi>abſent from the body they are preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. All this we ſee in one bleſſed Scripture, viz. that in Heb. 12.22, 23. <hi>We are come to the heavenly Jeruſalem, to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable company of Angels, to God the judge of all, to the Spirits of juſt men made perfect, to Jeſus the mediator of the new covenant.</hi>

III. <hi>When Godly Men dye, holy Angels carry their Souls to Heaven.</hi> They go to <hi>Abraham's Boſom,</hi> but who does Conduct them thither: <hi>Angels</hi> do it. <hi>Lazarus</hi> died, and <hi>Angels</hi> carried him to be with <hi>Abraham.</hi> As when <hi>Elijah</hi> was carried to Heaven Body and Soul, it was by the Miniſtry of Holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels. There was ſeen a <hi>Chariot of Fire, and Horſes of Fire,</hi> Holy Angels appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that Form, and <hi>Elijah went up to Heaven,</hi> 2 King. 2.11. And they ſhall carry the raiſed Bodies of the Saints to be with Chriſt at the Laſt Day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.31. He ſhall ſend his Angels with the ſound of a Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and they ſhall <hi>gather together his Elect from the four Winds, from one end of Heaven to the other.</hi> So do they do with the Souls of the Elect when their Bodies die. It was an Ancient Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among the Jewiſh Writers, That <hi>none have right to Paradiſe, but the Juſt, whoſe Souls are carried thither by Angels.</hi> The Platonick Philoſophers did not only believe, that the Souls of Men
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:001767_0120_0FB826FD3304DA20"/>
were Immortal, but that the Souls of Wicked Men at the Hour of Death, were by Evil Angels carried to a worſe World than this, and the Souls of Good Men by Good Angels, to a better World. We may ſuppoſe that they had this Knowlege from the Jews, and that the Jews derived it from the holy Patriarchs and Prophets. To intimate this Truth, is a ſpecial ſcope and deſign of the Parable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus.</hi> And this has been the Faith of dying Saints. It is reported concerning the Famous <hi>Morney,</hi> that when dying he expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf after this manner. <hi>I am ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king my flight to Heaven: there are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſtanding, ready to carry my Soul into the Boſom of my Saviour.</hi> There was a Faithful Miniſter of Chriſt in <hi>New-England,</hi> (it was Mr. <hi>Newman,</hi> Paſtor of the Church in <hi>Reho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

concerned or afraid, but after he had ſpoke a few ſolemn Words to them about him, made an <hi>Apoſtrophe</hi> to the Angels; <hi>And now</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels come and do your Office.</hi> Thoſe Words were no ſooner out of his Mouth but he dyed Angels were by, they heard what he ſaid, and were ready to Conduct his Pious Soul to Heaven. Several Things may be mentioned which confirm the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine before us</p>
            <p n="1">1. Angels are by Divine appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Guardians of ſuch as belong to God. Pſal 34 7. <hi>The Angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him.</hi> They are charged with them, Pſal. 91.11, 12. <hi>He ſhall give his Angels charge over them. They ſhall bear them up in their h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An Heir of Salvation does no ſooner come into the World, but Angels are charged to look after him. Nor does the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Angel in Heaven think it beneath him, to have ſuch a Charge: <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:001767_0122_0FB82701280B8E70"/>
14. <hi>Are they not all miniſtring Spirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of Salvation.</hi> For the Devil ſtands ready to devour them as ſoon as they are born, as he would have done our Saviour Chriſt: Rev. 12.4. <hi>The Dragon ſtood before the Woman, which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her Child as ſoon as it was born</hi>: which Words altho' figurative, have reſpect to that which is really true. As ſoon as Chriſt was Born, the <hi>Devil</hi> ſtood ready to devour Him, by his Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>Herod,</hi> but he was preſerved from that Dragon, by the Miniſtry of an Angel, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.13. So are the Elect of God under the Guardianſhip of Angels, whileſt in a ſtate of Infancy. The Scripture gives us to underſtand that <hi>

                  </gap> ones</hi> have <hi>their Angels,</hi> Mat. 18 10 And when they are arrived to Adult Age, ſtill Angels have the charge of them. Wherever they are, whether by Sea or Land Angels are with them Thus from their Infancy, and to their Old Age, and to their dying Day. The Lord ſays of his
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:001767_0123_0FB827052FA0A468"/>
People, <hi>They are born by me from the belly, and are carried from the womb, and even to your old age I am he, and even to hoar hairs will I carry you, even I will carry and deliver you,</hi> Iſai. 46.3, 4. And how does God bear and carry them? He does it by the Miniſtry of holy Angels. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in his Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, was affected with this thought, that <hi>from the time of his nativity to the end of his Life, Angels were appointed to be his Guardians.</hi> Can we think that Angels will take care of us all our life time, and then leave us at our Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Angels have a great love for godly Men. They rejoyce at their welfare. They ſang when there was a Saviour born for Men. Luk. 2 13, 14. <hi>There was with the Angel a multitude of the heavenly hoſt praiſing God, and ſaying, glory to God in the higheſt, and on Earth peace, good will toward men.</hi> When an Elect ſinner is Converted it cauſes no little joy among the Angels of God in Heaven, <hi>Luk</hi>

<pb n="111" facs="unknown:001767_0124_0FB8270688743328"/>
Men that keep his Covenant. The Pſalmiſt having ſpoken thus, calls up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Angels to bleſs the Lord: Pſal. 103.20, 21. <hi>Bleſs the Lord ye his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, bleſs the Lord all ye his hoſts, ye Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of his that do his pleaſure.</hi> God loves godly Men, and therefore An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do ſo, for it is natural for them to love what God loves. They love the Image of God wherever they ſee it. They are of the ſame Family with Believers on Chriſt, therefore they love them. Eph. 3.15. <hi>Of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named.</hi> Angels in Heaven and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers on Earth belong to the ſame Family of God. They are fellow Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. The Angel ſaid to <hi>John, I am thy fellow ſervant, and of thy brethren that have the teſtimony of Jeſus,</hi> Rev. 19.10. Their love to holy Men muſt needs be confirmed and encreaſed, by their having been their Companions and Guardians for ſo long a time. Kind Offices encreaſe love. We ſee that Nurſes have a ſpecial affection for the Children that have been foſtered
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:001767_0125_0FB82707DCFBEFE8"/>
by them. So have the Angels of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for thoſe Children of God who have been under their care, tuition, and education, and have been foſtered by them from their Cradles to their Graves. Moreover, they know that godly Men ſhall live with them in Heaven forever, and therefore they muſt needs be willing to go with their Souls to Heaven when they leave this Earth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſeparated Souls of godly Men, ſtand in need of ſuch Guardians to carry them to Heaven. For they paſs through their Enemies Country. The Air is the Devils Territory. There is a <hi>power</hi> of thoſe evil Spirits there. The Devil is called <hi>the prince of the power of the air,</hi> Eph 2 2. If Men are to paſs through the midſt of Pyrates, they need a ſtrong Convoy to guard them. The Pyrates of Hell are waiting to ſeize upon the Souls of Men, as ſoon as they are out of their Bodies. Godly Souls need not fear them, becauſe they have a Convoy of Angels to protect them, and to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

            <p>PROP. IV. <hi>This Priviledge belongs to the pooreſt and meaneſt godly Men as well as to the richeſt and greateſt.</hi> As the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks with reſpect to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dignity, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

A poor beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly <hi>Lazarus</hi> having a godly Soul, is conducted to Heaven after this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable manner, with a glorious E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipage.

is as valuable as the Soul of a rich Man, more worth than the whole World. There are poor Men belonging to the Election of God, as well as rich Men. Nay, there are more poor than rich among thoſe whom God has choſen. Jam. 2 5. <hi>Has not God choſen the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promiſed to them that love him.</hi> The Redemption of the Soul of a poor Man, has coſt as great a price as the Redemption of the Soul of a rich Man <hi>viz.</hi> the precious Blood of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God.

                  <hi>Godly Men ought not to be afraid of Death, but rather to rejoyce at the thought of it.</hi> Death is indeed a frightful evil to Nature. The Philoſopher calls it, <hi>Of all terribles the moſt terrible.</hi> And

                  <hi>Bildad</hi> ſtyles Death, <hi>The King of Terrors,</hi> Job 18 14. It exceeds other <hi>terribles</hi> as much as a King excels ordinary Men. A great Man among the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans was ſo terribly afraid of Death, as that he ſaid he would be willing to be in any pain and miſery, on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he might but live. And ſince Godly Men have Nature remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them, the apprehenſion of Death is frightful to ſome of them. <hi>Through fear of Death they are kept in bondage all their life time.</hi> But believers ought not to be afraid of it. And we find in the Scripture that ſome of the Lords Servants, have been above the fear of Death. The Pſalmiſt could ſay, <hi>Though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil.</hi> And why ſhould he, when he had Angels to be with him? When <hi>Moſes</hi> was told that he ſhould go up Mount <hi>Nebo</hi> &amp; there die, he was no more afraid than a Man would be to go up his Chamber, there to ly down &amp; ſleep.

rather be <hi>willing,</hi> nay, <hi>deſirous</hi> of the hour of their death, than to be afraid of it: 2 Cor. 5.8. <hi>We are willing <hi>rather</hi> to be abſent from the body &amp; pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Lord.</hi> Good old <hi>Simeon</hi> ſaid, <hi>Now Lord let thy ſervant depart in Peace,</hi> Luk. 2.29.

Well may they be willing &amp; deſirous of the Day of Death, which will be better to them than the Day of their Birth, Conſidering that their Bodies are no ſooner dead, but their Souls are in the hands of Angels, who will fly with them to Heaven. It is for Ungodly Men to be afraid of Death, and well they may, becauſe of that which (as to them) ſhall follow Death, which what it will you may find in, Rev. 6.8. <hi>Behold a pale horſe, and his name that ſat on him was <hi>Death,</hi> and hell followed with him.</hi> An Ungodly Man is no ſooner dead as to his Body, but his Soul is in Hell.
