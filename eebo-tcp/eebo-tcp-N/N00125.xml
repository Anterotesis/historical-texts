         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

wherein the Lord (after the manner of men) passionately expresseth his desire that <hi>they would be spiritually wise to consider what would become of them, if they held on their course of sinning against the Lord:</hi> what would be the sad end and issue of their Rebellions against <hi>the God of their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> I know indeed that some understand these words, <hi>ver.</hi> 28, 29. as spoken of the Enemies of <hi>Israel.</hi> As if the Lord had said: <hi>If they were wise in deed, they would not say our band is high and the Lord hath not done all this as</hi> ver. 27. <hi>nor attribute and ascribe their prosperous and victorious Proceedings, and the destructions they bad brought upon</hi> Israel <hi>to their own prowess and policy, but would easily understand that God had delivered up his People to misery and destruction for their sins.</hi> Yea, and they would consider also their own latter end, that is, what end remaineth for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves also, even the like destruction for their great Abominations impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently persisted in. But we have no reason to recede from the received common Interpretation of the Words, or question their immediate Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication to the People of <hi>Israel.</hi> The Words are plainly spoken of <hi>Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, the peculiar People of God, in a condition of great degeneracy:</hi> wherein the Lord intimates and expresseth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ground and occasion of that Misery and Ruine that was come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon them, namely, their want of Counsel and Understanding, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. The misery that befel them at several seasons in these and those Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations was not either undeserved or accidental: but as the hand of God inflicted it in a way of just severity, so their incurable Folly and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness was the meritorious cause that brought it upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Cure, the Help, the only Remedy, or rather, that which would have saved them and secured their Nation, with all the concernments of it from those Ruines, and prevented such a sad issue and calamitous event, namely, Wisdome, <hi>ver.</hi> 29. which is in the words of the Text, amplified from the Act and Object thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>First,</hi> The Act of this Wisdome: and that is double,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To Understand. <hi>Oh that they were wise, that they understood this.</hi> The Word so translated signifies also to prosper, and to make prosperous: because though men of Understanding are not alwayes, yet they are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily prosperous, their counsels and actions are usually attended and waited on with success. The Word therefore may import a prosperous, successful, right understanding of things. Yet it signifies an acute and subtle and accurate understanding, with an intense and industrious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

observes. And considering the Conjugation wherein it is used, it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, to make (that is, to make themselves) to understand. Gods donation of this wisdome and understanding excludes not, but supposes our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to acquire it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To Consider: The Original word hath Affinity with <hi>Banah</hi> (as <hi>Avenarius</hi> notes) which signifies <hi>to build.</hi> A man of consideration must be like a wise <hi>Architect</hi> that disposes in his minde, contrives, conceives, models, frames and casts the several parts of his Fabrick or building. To consider is to cast, and conceive, and get the model or idea, the Platform (as it were) of this or that Object in our minds. And it notes a judicious, fixed or abiding dijudication of things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Object of this Wisdome, Understanding and Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and that is, <hi>their latter End. End</hi> in this place noteth not the final cause (as when we say, the last end of man is to glorifie God) but the <hi>exitus,</hi> the term, the issue, the upshot, the event and the conclusion of those sinful wayes they were engaged in. As when it is said <hi>the end of some way that seemeth right unto a man (are the wayes of death: and the end of some mirth is heaviness, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> Prov.</hi> 14. 12,13. the wisdome of that people should have exprest it self in understanding and considering the latter end of their wayes. Not so much <hi>finis operantis,</hi> the end intended by themselves; as <hi>finis operis,</hi> the end of their wayes and doings, the scope, and tendency, and issue of their evil and unworthy deportments should have been considered by them.</p>
            <p>I shall only adde, that the form of this expression in the Text is <hi>opta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; O that they were wise,</hi> &amp;c. we meet with the like form of speech, and mode of expression attributed to God in other places of Scripture. As <hi>Psal.</hi> 81. 13. <hi>O that my People had hearkened unto me, and Israel had wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked in my wayes,</hi> and Isai. 48. 18. <hi>O that thou hadst hearkened to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,</hi> &amp;c. the like occurs in other places. There is indeed some difficulty in it; For you will say,</p>
            <p>Obj. <hi>How can the Lord be said to wish this? He could have made them wise, and understanding, and considering men and women, if it had been his good will and pleasure.

manner becoming the glorious Nature and Being of God. It is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festly an expression borrowed from the manner of men, lamenting the rashness, the folly, the inconsiderateness of their Children, and their want of understanding, their wayes and the issue of them. And yet we must understand, and take it up in a manner becoming and comporting with the perfect nature of the blessed God. The Lord doth not really and properly carry himself, as a Father that stands wringing his hands over a prodigal Son, and saith, <hi>O that thou wouldst be wise, that thou wouldst un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand thy self, that thou wouldst consider what these prodigal courses will come to at last,</hi> what will be the end of thy Drunkenness, thy Lacivious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, thy Company keeping, thy great Idleness, and vain expence of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Time, Estate and Strength in this manner! O that thou wouldst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>think thy self and consider what will be the issue of these lewd wayes and courses! the poor afflicted Father may wish and desire it; but hath not power to give such an heart: but God alone can do it. If the Lord had willed properly with the will of purpose, or decreed that <hi>Israel</hi> should be wise to understand and consider their latter end, he both could and would have conferred upon them that wisdome, and prudent consideration of it; and that without any impeachment of or detriment to the liberty of their wills. It is at first sight a strange expression which we meet with; <hi>Deut.</hi> 5 29. <hi>O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear me,</hi> &amp;c. In the Original it is (word for word) <hi>Who will give that their heart may be such in them.</hi> as Mr.<hi>Ainsworth</hi> reads it. Why doth God need to ask the question: <hi>who will give them such an heart?</hi> He knows that none but himself can give such an heart, and that he can effectually give it: and he knows whether he hath determined to give it or not. And therefore the expression must be understood after the manner of men. It is evident to any under standing man, that these things cannot be spoken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of God pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly and rigorously (as the <hi>Arminians</hi> absurdly strain them) <hi>salva Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               <hi>Reas.</hi> 1. Because it is the great act of Wisdome to deduce, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to inferre one thing from another. And so one of the <hi>Jewish Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors</hi> saith, that <gap reason="foreign">

To <hi>consider understandingly what will be the End of these or those wayes,</hi> imports in it a laying of things together in a Syllogistical way. Hence when men reason amiss, and conclude that which is not virtually contained in the Premises, or make wrong inferences, they are said to Paralogize themselves. <hi>Be ye doers of the word</hi> (saith the Apostle, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 22.) <hi>and not hearers onely,</hi>

               </gap>. We are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant hearers of the Word, and waiters upon the Ordinances of God; therefore we are certainly in a good condition. The Apostle calls this a Paralogism, Sophistical Reasoning, and unsound Argumentation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with many Professors are wont to cheat themselves. So, <hi>We are Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's children,</hi> a people in Covenant with God, and we have his Temple,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000180_0017_0FA315DA04E7A550"/>
and Worship, and Ordinances among us: therefore though we indulge to sin, and do these and those abominations, yet God will dwell among us, and we shall do well enough. These are lying words, false inconse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quential Inferences, and foolish Reasonings. But to syllogize aright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>the End of these and those wayes,</hi> is an act of Wisdome indeed. This is the work of Conscience, when it relates to the Moral actions of a man, and the issue of them; and it belongs to <hi>Syllogistical Judgement. This</hi> will follow upon <hi>that;</hi> this will be the <hi>certain Consequent of such an Antecedent;</hi> this will be the <hi>Conclusion</hi> resulting from <hi>those Premises.</hi> Wisdome lyes in the <hi>Rational Application</hi> of general Rules of Scripture to our selves and our own conditions, and in the <hi>induction of particulars,</hi> and due Reasoning from it: <hi>This hath been the End of such and such wayes, to these and those persons</hi> (witness Scripture and Experience) <hi>therefore will be so of mine also.</hi> The End is virtually in the way, as the Conclusion in the Premises. To consider and finde out this, and reason aright in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is an act of great wisdome and judgement.</p>

There can be no greater wisdome then to conform to, and comply with every part of the revealed will of God. The Lord calls aloud upon that people of <hi>Israel</hi> again and again to <hi>consider their wayes,</hi> Haggai 1. 5,7. that is, the sad fruit and issue of them.

               </gap>rue thereby? <hi>Interest</hi> and <hi>Advantage</hi> is wont to lead men captive, and to influence them marvellously: and there is ordinarily no surer way to prevail with them, then by arguing <hi>ab Utili,</hi> and demonstrating the advantagiousness and expediency of any course or duty. Hence the Lord, when he would reason his people into a Care and Conscience of universal obedience to his Commandments in general, argues from this Topick or Head of Argument, <hi>Ut tibi benè sit, That it may go well with thee,</hi> Deut. 4. 40.—5. 29.—6. 3,18.—12. 28. So may I reason in this case from the profit and advantage of such a course of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration. A person or people do consult their own good, singular advantage in it. Hereby they may come to <hi>understand the signs of the Times,</hi> the want of which skill our Saviour taxeth severely, <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 2,3. Men are usually wise to discern the signs of the Weather, and can probably conjecture when it will be fair, and when it will be foul Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but this is Wisdome indeed, to understand and discern the dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sations of God, in a way of <hi>Mercy</hi> or <hi>Judgement,</hi> beforehand, and to know what God is doing, or about to do with them. As men can by the Aspect of the Sky prognosticate what Weather it will be: so they may be able to <hi>make a Judgement</hi> of their condition, and what is like to become of them, by the Aspect of their own wayes and deportments towards the Lord. Hereby they may know what to expect from the Lord, whether Mercy or Judgement, according to the ordinary Rule and Tenour of Gods dispensations. Hereby they may be awakened to Repentance, and the casting away or turning from those iniquities and transgressions that are otherwise sure to be their Ruine, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 30,31. Mark those steps, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. <hi>Because he considereth, and turneth away from all his transgressions that be hath committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</hi> Consideration makes way for Repentance and Conversion, and this for life and happiness. Serious consideration of <hi>the nature and End of our wayes,</hi> leads the way to Repentance and Reformation. Hereby
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000180_0019_0FA315DB866C6CA8"/>
they may be quickned and helped to <hi>meet God, when he is coming forth in the way of his Judgements,</hi> in a way of Humiliation and Supplication, <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 12. and to <hi>wait for him in the way of his Judgements,</hi> Isa. 26. 8. And if there be any way to avert the Judgements of God, this is it.

And to follow him into a wilderness, a land that was not sown, a place of great hardships and difficulties? And was it not God who then sweetned their wilderness condition to them, conducted them as with the <hi>Pillar of Cloud and Fire,</hi> protected them from the many dangers that threatned them, and directed them (being <hi>a Sun as well as a shield unto them.</hi> Psal. 84. 11) in the happy settlement of Church and State, effecting great things by small and despicable means? was it not the same mighty hand of God, that routed and put to flight the spirit of Error and Heresie that was growing and getting head among you in your beginning times, plainly threatning the subversion of your State, and the destruction of your Civil and Sacred Concernments and Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? was it not the same Almighty Arm that vanquished the <hi>Pequots,</hi> and put the dread and terrour of you into the hearts of the Natives, that you have <hi>dwelt safely in this wilderness, and slept securely in thes. woods? Ezek</hi> 34. 25. Hath not the Lord given a miscarrying womb unto all such as have conceived and been big with mischievous designs against you?

sensible experience of the lighting down of the omnipotent Arm of God on your behalf. Happy art thou Oh <hi>New England-Israel!</hi> who is like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, O people saved by the Lord, <hi>the Shield of thy help, and who is the Sword of thy Excellency! and thine enemies have been found lyars unto thee.</hi> as <hi>Moses</hi> speaks upon consideration of the Condition of that <hi>Israel,</hi> Deut. 33. 29. So that as he faith, <hi>Bless ye the Lord from the Fountain of</hi> Israel.<hi> Psal.</hi> 68. 26. That is, either you that derive your Original from the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Israel,</hi> that descend from him as his natural off-spring and Posterity, (as the words are generally expounded) or (if I may be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed so to gloss and improve them) Bless him for all the mercies that have been conferred upon you from the Fountain, or first Original of <hi>Israel</hi> to this Day.

We may say with wonderment (almost) in the words of <hi>Moses,</hi> Deut. 4. 32. Ask now of many of the Ages that are past, and ask from one side of Heaven unto the other, whether there hath been any such Thing as this great Thing is, or hath been heard like it, for many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations? Hath God essayed to go and take him a part of a Nation from the midst of a Nation, by temptations, by signs, by wonders, by a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hand &amp; by an out-stretched arm, according to all that the Lord your God hath done for you before your eyes? God hath shewn us almost unexam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled unparalled mercy. And it were very well if there were a memorial of these things faithfully drawn up, and transmitted to Posterity, as the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Servant of God, that spoke to you the last year, moved and advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Mr. <hi>Shepard's</hi> Election Sermon, <hi>pag.</hi> 15. 16. However it is our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duty to be the Lords <hi>Remembrancers or Recorders, Isa.</hi> 62. 6 that the mercies of the Lord (that hath allured us into this wilderness, spoken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to us and dealt bountifully with us therein) may be faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistred in our hearts, and remembred by us. It is a desirable thing, that all the loving kindnesses of God, and his singular favours to this poor and despised out cast might be Chronicled and communicated (in the History of them) to succeeding Ages; that the memory of them may not dy and be extinct, with the present Generation: And it is the unquestionable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of every one of us to keep in mind and <hi>consider the signal works of the Lord, and the operation of his hands</hi> for and in the behalf of his dear people in this wilderness.</p>
            <p>Now then, this being your Condition that you are in a manner parallel with <hi>Israel</hi> in their mercies: and that in the apprehension of all considering
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000180_0029_0FA315E3048B25A0"/>
men we are too like them in their sinful deportments also: (all sides are agreed that things are in a declining posture, that there is a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generacy, that things look with another Face, that there is a defection and declension: though all are not resolved wherein it doth consist, some char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging it one way, some another, as their judgement or Affection, or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Interest leads them; yet they all center in this, that there is a back sliding and declension among us) Give me leave therefore, (who am much a stranger) to take it for granted, not only from <hi>my own observation,</hi> but especially from the <hi>the Confession of all parties</hi> (and what better evidence can be expected?) that this <hi>Noble vine</hi> planted by the Lords own right hand is become <hi>degenerous,</hi> that your wayes are unanswerable to the wayes of God, that your <hi>deportments</hi> are unsuitable to your <hi>engagements</hi> and the Lords <hi>expectations:</hi> and therefore to <hi>pursue the Exhortation</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seeching and perswading you <hi>to understand and Consider what is like to be your latter end.</hi> It will be your Interest to Consider, first,<hi>whence you are fallen,</hi> Rev. 2. 5.

And truly me-thinks I hear the Lord speaking these very words of <hi>New-England</hi> at this Day: <hi>Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider, their latter end.</hi> As Christ sometimes stood weeping over <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> &amp; said, <hi>O that thou badst known even thou, at least in this thy day, the things which belong unto thy peace!</hi> Luk. 19. 41,43. So me thinks the Lord Jesus is this day standing above, beholding us from the height of his glory, and saying, Oh that my dear people in <hi>New England</hi> (whom I have peculiarly loved, and pitied, and protected, and blessed,) <hi>were wise, and would consider understandingly and rationally what the end of their sinful deportments before me will be at last.</hi> I hope he doth not adde; <hi>But now this wisdom is bid from their eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I confess I was under some temptation to have singled out such a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the Discussion or Handling whereof some general Christian Duties might have been commended to this great Assembly (so considerable as to the quality and publick capacity, as well as numerousness of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors,) to have declined all such Discourses as might seem to grate, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect blame, and bear too hard upon these or those. I would not have the Ministers of Christ needlesly to tamper or intermeddle with State affairs, or direct and dictate to Rulers, and intrude themselves into such things as are out of their sphere, and forreign to their calling and profession, unless upon insuperable occasions. I have seen much evil and inconvenience in it elsewhere: I would not pass the bounds, or go beyond he line of my

calling and commission from Jesus Christ. <hi>Trectent Fabrilia Fabri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Moreover I have considered (as a Discouragement from attempting any thing in this kind) that I am much a stranger to the Spirits, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and Practises of men in this Country, and greatly unacquainted with the state of affairs among you, and that it is no easie matter to gain thorough and certain information. And that good caution also came to minde, as a seasonable <hi>memento,</hi>

               <hi>a Stranger must be no needless medler.</hi> I considered also, that where men are in a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided posture, and their hearts are hot within them, there is small hope of doing any good. To what purpose is it to charm <hi>deaf Adders?</hi> such are men usually that are addicted to sides and parties: they are deaf on one side, and cannot hear of that ear. If a man had the meekness and gravity, and Fatherly spirit and affection that <hi>Moses</hi> discovers in the Book of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> the Wisdome and Reason on <hi>Solomon</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> the Tongue and Eloquence of <hi>Isaiah,</hi> the best accomplishments of any Son of <hi>Adam:</hi> yet it would in reason signifie little, where he hath to do with the ignorance, the pride, the perverseness, the conceitedness, the prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the opinionativeness of engaged men. Many good men, though in no good frame, are too like him in the Comedy, that said <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> God alone in some more then ordinary way of working that can retrive the Interest of Christ among us, and reduce us again. Probable it is, that it must be some sharp affliction, some smarting rod, or sore tryal that must come upon these Churches to reduce them generally to their old trembling frame of spirit at the Word of God, and humble submission to the dispensation of it: And there is great reason to conceive that many Professors may be grown Sermon proof, that we had as good preach to the Heavens and Earth, and direct our discourse to the Walls and Seats and Pillars of the meeting house, and say, Hear, O ye Walls, give ear O ye Seats and Pillars, as to many men in these Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, that are deaf to all that is cried in their ears by the Lords Messengers, and are indeed like Rocks in the Sea, not to be stirred and moved by the beating and dashing of these waters of the Sanctuary, or by the strongest gust of rational and affectionate discourse that can blow upon them. I considered also that there may be too many, even in the Bosome of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>English Churches that have lived long in that great sin of confronting

I considered also that it is a matter of some difficulty, a dangerous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, to search the wounds of this poor Country, left instead of Help and Healing, they should be but the more enflamed, irritated and exasperated thereby.</p>
            <p>However having this oportunity, unsought and undesired by me, nay thrust upon me, I shall adventure (as God shall assist) to speak something to the present case and condition of the Country: If weakly and unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visedly in any respect, I beg pardon of God and of his People; And if the Lord help to any words of wisdome; I know wisdome will be justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied of its Children, whoever condemn it, and I shall deliver my own soul, and express my compassion to the souls of others, and my faithfulness to the Interest of Christ in <hi>New-England,</hi> and those that will not hear shall be inexcusable. The condition of Affairs at this juncture calls for some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.—<hi>In magnis voluisse sat est.</hi> I beseech you lend me a patient and unprejudiced ear.

            <p>That which I have to commend to you, and entreat of you (even <hi>in the bowels of Jesus Christ</hi>) is, <hi>the understanding, serious consideration of the latter

their respective interests) do not make more Church-members, then the conviction or evidence of their fitness for such a priviledge. May not that be the issue of these differences, that Adherence to a party, or to be a Darling of the Faction, will become as passant a Qualification with this or that party or Faction for admission into the Church of God, as visible Saint-ship hath been among us? And that, <hi>Who are you for,</hi> will be in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality the only <hi>Test and Touch stone</hi> of the sufficiency of persons for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with us in Church ordinances? Nay further, as <hi>I</hi> remember it hath been said of Lawyers, and too much verified in the men of that profession, that <hi>Contention maintains them, and they maintain Contention:</hi> so may it not be truly said of many men in Churches, (that have few commendable Qualities in them, whether you consider them as men or Christians) that <hi>Contention</hi> maintains them in Credit and Reputation with their party: and <hi>they</hi> maintain <hi>Contention</hi> in heart and vigour among us?

Moreover it is a very great provocation to the God of peace, that you should strive and contend, judge and despise one another, and fall out so unreasonably about lesser matters, and such things as are forreign to the Bond of Christian-Communion. When you should be blessing God that you agree so far, you are wrangling because that you disagree a little: when you should thank God that you agree so much, you quarrel because you agree no more.

And for their Way of <hi>Church-Government</hi> it must be confessed that, in the day of it, it was a very considerable step to Reformation. The Church of God hath been recovered by degrees out of the <hi>antichristian Apostacy.</hi> When our Lord Jesus wrought the Cure on that <hi>Blind Man,</hi> Mark 8. 23,24,25.

The <hi>Reformation</hi> in King <hi>Edward's</hi> dayes was then a blessed work: And the <hi>Reformation of Geneva</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> was a larger step, and in many respects purer then the other.

degeneracy, if we should leave the good old way so far as to turn <hi>Councils</hi> and <hi>Synods</hi> into <hi>Classes</hi> and <hi>Provincial Assemblies,</hi> and there should be such a laxeness in Admission of Members to Communion as is pleaded for and practised by many <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and Elders should manage all them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in an <hi>Autocratorical, absolute way</hi> to the utter Subversion or Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the liberty and priviledge of the Brethren. Our Worthies that are gone off the Stage allowed the Priviledge of the Brethren without any infringement of the Rule and Authority of the <hi>Presbytery,</hi> and knew how to reconcile them together. Whatever influence the concurrence of the Brethren hath into Church Acts, clear it is that it is necessarily required to the exercise of Church Authority, that all Ordinances may be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistred in a way of Edification. The Expressions of the deservedly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Dr. <hi>Owen</hi> are very considerable. <q>
                  <hi>The Reason</hi> (saith he) <hi>why the consent of the Church is required unto the Authoritative Acting of the Elders therein, is not because from thence any Authority doth accrue unto them a new, which vertually and radically they had not before: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by the Rule of the Gospel this is required to the orderly acting of their power, without which it would be contrary to Rule, and therefore ineffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al: as also it must needs be from the nature of the thing it self: for no act can take place in the Church without or against its own consent, whilest its Obedience is voluntary and of choice. And in case the Church refuse to consent to such Acts as are according to Rule, the Elders must instruct them in their Duty, declare to them the danger of Dissent, wait patiently for the concurrence of the Grace of God with their Ministry in giving Light and Obedience to the Church: and in case of the Churches continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in any Failure of Duty, to seek for advice and counsel from the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and Brethren of other Churches.</hi>

not see this, And just it is that those that will not obey them in the Lord that have the rule over them, should be thus enslaved to the imperious and uncertain Humours of these and those usurping Brethren. And it is to be feared, that many of our Brethren (such is their weakness, and the power of prejudice) will never come humbly and kindly to submit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in the Lord to the Government as Jesus Christ in his Church, till they have been soundly scratched with this <hi>Bramble Government</hi> of some aspiring and domineering Brethren. But I beseech you, Observe the mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief of this practise. It is a staple Principle of our ablest <hi>Congregational, men</hi> that as there is a liberty and priviledge appertaining to the Brethren; so the Rule and Government (properly so called) is appropriated to the Elders by the appointment of Jesus Christ. Now the Promise and Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing goes with the Institution. So that where the Elders are in effect set by, and three or four heady Brethren lead the Church and rule all: They are in such Administrations under the wing and shadow of no promise or bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing which to a gracious heart is a dreadful consideration. Again the loud Out-cry of some is for <hi>Liberty of Conscience:</hi> that they may hold and practise what they will in Religion. This is the <hi>Diana</hi> of some men, and <hi>great is the Diana of the Libertines of this age.</hi> I remember <hi>Julian</hi> the <hi>Apostate,</hi> that malicious and implacable Enemy to Christianity have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served that the <hi>Christian Religion</hi> prospered the more for the severe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution in <hi>Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Such is that liberty of Conscience, even a liberty of Perdition, that some men are so unconscionably Clamorous for. But remember, that as long as you have liberty to walk in the Faith and Order of the Gospel, and may <hi>lead quiet and peaceable lives in all Godliness and Honesty,</hi> you have as much liberty of Conscience as <hi>Paul</hi> desired under any Government, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 1, 2. He that is allowed without molestation to walk with God, and serve him with all good Conscience, hath liberty enough. Never complain, when that is your condition, that you may be as good as you will.

God is to be trusted with the preservation of thy Life: wilt thou not therefore in Case of Ilness, bleed and vomit, and purge out the peccant and noxious humours? God is to be trusted for the preservation of thy Corn in the Field, when it is growing up: wilt thou not therefore weed thy Corn, and take away what offends, and hinders the thriving of it? If it be replied; But this is no means of God's Appointment. Magistrates have nothing to do with matters of Religion, to interpose and exercise their coercive power in and about the things of God. I Answer. This is a meer begging of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, and was never yet proved. But I must not dispute or further expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate here.
