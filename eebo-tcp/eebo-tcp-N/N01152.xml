            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>THOSE that have been Eminent Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers in the Church of God, have ſeldom or never been ſo happy, as to Effect a perfect Reformation. <hi>Aſa</hi> reformed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, <hi>But the high places were not taken away,</hi> 2 Chron. 15. 17. And tho' it is ſaid of <hi>Jehoſhaphat.</hi> that <hi>he took away the high places out of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> 2 Chron. 17. 6. Yet, <hi>Chap.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 33 it is noted, that in the latter end of his Reign, <hi>That the high places were not taken away:</hi> the meaning is, that he did take them away in part, yet did not perfectly effect it. Corruption is wont to creep upon the Church by degrees, and Reformation is not effected at once. Sometimes when thoſe things that are more groſs are taken away, ſome leſſer Corruptions are retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and ſometimes when men go from one extream, they don't ſtop where they ſhould, but treſpaſs on the other hand. This comes to paſs, partly through the dim-ſighredneſs of men: when many Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are grown up in the Church, it muſt be a work of Time to make a diſcovery of them; thoſe that diſcern ſome, are not ſuſpicious of others; when the Church is much corrupted, it is a time of darkneſs, and Errors do not lye open to Obſervation. Partly it comes to paſs through the perverſneſs, and ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borneſs of People, who are backward to turn out of thoſe ways that they have been naturalized unto: that is given as the reaſon why the High places were not taken away, becauſe <hi>the People had not prepared their heart to the Lord God of their Fathers,</hi> 2 Chron. 20. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:001372_0003_0FB292C8548D98C0"/>
There have been three remarkeable Inſtances in theſe later Ages of the imperfect accompliſhment of the work of Reformation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucher</hi> was an inſtrument in the hand of God to open a door of deliverance from <hi>Popery:</hi> and he did with abundance of Evidence, make a diſcovery of a Multitude of Abominations in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> yet was ſo unhappy as to fall into that corrupt Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Conſubſtantiation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The glorious Reformers of our Nation in the dayes of K. <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixth, went beyond <hi>Luther</hi> in the work of Reformation, and yet even that glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation was very imperfect, and wanting in many things to be mended by the Church in Succeeding Ages: And thoſe holy men who firſt planted this Land, carryed on the work of Reformation to an higher pitch, yet failed in ſeveral things; eſpecially in two points, <hi>viz.</hi> in not accepting Non-ſcandalous Perſons into their Communion; and in not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging a Publick Government in the Church.</p>
            <p>And ſuch is the miſery of the Church of God that the miſtakes of thoſe worthy men, who have led in the work of Reformation, do prove an invincible temptation to many men. As the Renown of thoſe Reformers is a bulwark againſt thoſe Errors that were Exploded by them, ſo we find our ſelves embarraſſed by their miſtakes from proceeding in the work of Reformation: As if it were criminal not to miſtake with them.</p>
            <p>It may poſſibly be a fault and an aggravation of a fault, to depart from the ways of our Fathers; but it may alſo be a vertue, and an eminent act of Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to depart from them in ſome things. Men are wont to make a great noiſe, that we are bringing in of Innovations, and depart from the Old Way: But it is beyond me to find out wherein the iniquity does
<pb facs="unknown:001372_0004_0FB292C9D46786A8"/>lye. We may ſee cauſe to alter ſome practiſes of our Fathers, without deſpiſing of them, without priding our ſelves in our own Wiſdom, without Apoſtacy, without abuſing the advantages that God has given us, without a ſpirit of compliance with corrupt men, without inclinations to Superſtition, without making diſturbance in the Church of God: And there is no reaſon that it ſhould be turned as a reproach upon us.</p>
            <p>Surely it is commendable for us to Examine the practiſes of our Fathers; we have no ſufficient reaſon to take practiſes upon truſt from them: let them have as high a character as belongs to them, yet we may not look upon their principles as Oracles. <hi>Nathan</hi> himſelf miſſed it in his conjecture about building the houſe of God: He that believes principles, becauſe they affirm them, makes Idols of them: and it would be no humility, but baſeneſs of ſpirit, for us to judge our ſelves uncapable, to Examine the principles that have been handed down to us: If we be any ways fit to open the Myſteries of the Goſpel, we are capable to judge of theſe matters: And it would ill become us ſo to indulge our ſelves in eaſe, as to neglect the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination of received principles. If the practiſes of our Fathers in any particulars were miſtakes, it is fit they ſhould be rejected, if they be not, they will bear Examination: If we be forbidden to Examine their practiſes, that will cut off all hopes of Reformation.</p>
            <p>The deſign of the following Diſcourſe, is to Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine One practiſe of theſe Churches, which is thought to be a failing. It was not compoſed on a deſign to be made thus Publick: but the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſome Gentlemen who heard it, has prevailed for the Printing of it.</p>
            <p>All that I requeſt of the Reader is, That he do not act like thoſe who told the Prophet: Jer. 44. 16. <hi>A for the word which thou haſt Spoken to us in the Name <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" extent="1 word">

            <head>The Inexcuſableneſs OF NEGLECTING THE Worſhip of GOD, under a pretence of being in an Unconverted Condition.</head>
            <epigraph>
               <bibl>Exodus XII. 47, 48.</bibl>
               <q>All the Congregation of Iſrael ſhall keep it. And when a ſtranger ſhall ſojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the Lord, let all his Males be circumciſed, and then let him come near and keep it: and he ſhall be as one that is born in the land: for no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed perſon ſhall eat thereof.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this Chapter we have the Inſtitution of the Paſsover, and the ſeveral Laws and Ordinances, that were to be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the celebration of it. Two of which are ſet down in theſe Verſes: Firſt, <hi>v.</hi> 47. <hi>All the Congregation of Iſrael ſhall keep it.</hi> This muſt be underſtood with its excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001372_0006_0FB292CCDAF0BA80"/>Thoſe that were Unclean, were not to keep it until they were cleanſed: <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 13. <hi>The man that is clean &amp; is not in a journey, and forbeareth to keep the Passover, even the ſame ſoul ſhall be cut off from his People.</hi> Another exception was of the Females: Women were not bound to go to the place which God ſhould chooſe, where the Paſsover was to be kept: <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 17. <hi>Three times in the year ſhall all thy Males ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before the Lord God.</hi> Yet when they were preſent they were bound to keep it. <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 4. <hi>If the houſehold be too little for the Lamb, let him &amp; his neighbour next unto his houſe, take it according to the number of the ſouls.</hi> Moſt probably alſo, they that were cut off from their People by a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Excommunication, were not to keep it. Secondly, <hi>v.</hi> 48. The ſtranger is allowed to keep it upon two conditions. (1) That he did deſire it. Sometimes ſtrangers that dwelt among them, became proſelites and did deſire to keep this Ordinance as they were not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled, ſo they were not to be rejected, if they deſired it in an orderly way. (2) That all his Males were circumciſed. Circumciſion was a token of God's Covenant, when they were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed, they were incorporated, and became as thoſe, who were born in the Land, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed equal priviledges with natural Iſraelites.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Doctrine</hi> to be ſpoken to, is, 
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001372_0007_0FB292CE48CA59D8"/>
That Sanctifying Grace is not neceſſary unto the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full attending of any duty of Worſhip.</p>
            <p>The whole Congregation whether ſincerely Godly or not, were to keep the Paſsover: Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace is an ineſtimable bleſſing, far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all the common gifts of the Spirit; it is the very Life of the Soul, it fus it to ſerve God &amp; to enjoy communion with him; and Sanctifying Grace is neceſſary to Salvation: without holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs no man can ſee the face of God: Yea, Sanctifying Grace is neceſſary to the accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attendance of every duty of Worſhip; if men were not holy their offerings were not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, nor their Sacrifices ſweet to God: but Sanctifying Grace is not neceſſary to the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attending of any duty of Worſhip: if men be not holy, yet it is lawful for them to attend any duty of Worſhip: No duty of Worſhip is forbidden to men, becauſe they are deſtitute of Sanctifying Grace. From the beginning of the World to this day, Men were never forbidden any duty of Worſhip, for want of Sanctifying Grace. Sanctifying Grace is neceſſary unto the right diſcharge of moral duties, as well as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted: but it is not neceſſary unto the lawful attending of Moral duties, or the lawful at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of Inſtituted duties; and as men may not excuſe themſelves from moral duties from the want of Grace, ſo they may not excuſe themſelves from any duty of Worſhip.</p>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001372_0008_0FB292CFB8AFDB28"/>
I ſhall clear up the Truth of this Doctrine by an Induction of particulars.</p>
            <p>I. <hi>Sanctifying Grace is not neceſſary unto the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending of thoſe duties of Worſhip which are required in all Ages.</hi> There are ſome duties of Worſhip that are not peculiar either to the State of the Church in the time of the Old Teſtament, or of the New, but common to both: and they may be attended by ſuch as are Godly, and ſuch as are not. Men in a natural condition may lawfully attend them; Mens being in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition is no ſufficient pretence for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting of them. <hi>As,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Prayer:</hi> Such mens Prayers are an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto God. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 9. <hi>He that turneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way his Ear from hearing the law, even his Prayer ſhall be abomination;</hi> but yet they are to be performed. It is the duty of all men to Pray to God, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18. 1. <hi>He ſpake a parable to them to this end that men ought always to pray:</hi> The Phariſees were blamed by Chriſt for Praying in the Streets, that they might have glory from men, and for making long Prayers for a pretence; but they are not blamed for Praying. Ungodly men are much blamed in Scripture for not Praying: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 4. <hi>They call not upon God.</hi> Iſai. 43 22. <hi>Thou haſt not called upon me, O Jacob.</hi> So men are bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for leaving off Praying: <hi>Job</hi> 27. 10. <hi>Will he always call upon God:</hi> And <hi>chap.</hi> 36. <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>They cry not when he bindeth them.</hi> All forts of men are directed to cry to God in their neceſſities:

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hearing of the Word.</hi> Men muſt aſſemble themſelves on the Sabbath to hear the Word. <hi>Lev.</hi> 23. 3. <hi>The ſeventh day is a Sabbath of reſt an boly convocation.</hi> Ungodly men muſt do it in order to their Converſion: The Word of God is the Means of Converſion: <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 18. <hi>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.</hi> The word of God teaches men to turn to God: it holds forth Conviction, Warning, Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment &amp; Direction. <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. 14. <hi>How ſhall they believe on him, of whom they have not heard.</hi> The word of God is the means of Regeneration: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19. 7. <hi>The law of the Lord is perfect Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Soul.</hi> Therefore Miniſters muſt Preach the Word to all ſorts of men, good &amp; bad, Chriſt Preached to the Multitude, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 1, 2. So did John the Baptiſt, ſo the Apoſtles: And it is ſpoken of as a very bad thing for men to withdraw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the aſſemblies of the People of God: <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25. Yea it is lawful to Preach the word of God to the Heathen: there was a tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry command to the Diſciples, that they ſhould

               <hi>not go into the way of the Gentiles, Mat.</hi> 10. 5. But afterward they were commanded, to <hi>teach all Nations, Mat.</hi> 28. 19. And go into all the world and Preach the Goſpel to every Creature; and if it be lawful to Preach to them, it is lawful for them to hear it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Preaching of the Word: It is upon all accounts moſt deſireable, that Preachers ſhould be Godly men,</hi> and <hi>Caeteris Paribus,</hi> they that are Converted themſelves are moſt likely to be inſtruments of the Converſion of Sinners, and the Edification of Saints. Yet it is lawful for men in a natural condition to Preach the Word Chriſt Jeſus ſent out <hi>Judas</hi> to Preach the Goſpel as well as the other Diſciples: <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 7. It was the work of the Prieſts and Levites to Preach to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Iſrael: Deut.</hi> 33. 10. <hi>They ſhall teach Jacob thy law, and Iſrael thy judgments.</hi> But we have no reaſon to think that they were all Godly. God gave extraordinary gifts in the Primitive times to ſome that were not Godly, to fit them for Preachers, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 11. <hi>If I ſpeak with the tongue of Men &amp; Angels, and have not charity,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſt directed the People to attend on the Preaching of the Scribes &amp; Phariſees. <hi>The Scribes &amp; Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, ſet in Moſes ſeat; whatſoever therefore they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do.</hi> And <hi>Paul</hi> rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in ſome mens Preaching of Chriſt, though they did it with a bad ſpirit, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 18.</p>
            <p>II. <hi>Sanctifying Grace was not neceſſary unto thoſe duties of Worſhip, that were peculiar to the times of
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001372_0011_0FB292DCABADE668"/>the Old Teſhament.</hi> There were ſeverals acts of worſhip that were Inſtituted of Old, but have been aboliſhed long ſince; when they were Divine inſtitutions, they were to be attended, not only by Godly, but alſo by Natural men.</p>
            <p>As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Circumciſion:</hi> Circumciſion was an holy Ordinance, a token of the Covenant between God and his People: but multitudes of People were according to the Ordinance of God to be Circumciſed in the fleſh, that were not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in heart. God never blamed the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for Circumciſing perſons that were not Regenerate. <hi>Abraham</hi> was appointed to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſe all the Males in his Family: <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 12, 13. <hi>Iſhmael</hi> was Circumciſed, but yet a carnal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon: <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 25. When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> bought Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants from among the Heathen, they were bound to Circumciſe them. All the Iſraelitiſh Male Children were in their ſeveral Generations to be Circumciſed, yet there were but few of them that proved Godly. God ordered that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be Circumciſed at <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal: Joſh.</hi> 5. 2. <hi>At that time the Lord ſaid unto Juſhua, make thee ſharp knives, &amp; circumciſe again the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael the ſecond time:</hi> yet multitudes of them were carnal men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Paſsover:</hi> This was a memorial of the Angels paſſing over the houſes of the Iſraelites, when the firſt born of the AEgyptians were ſlain, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 27. which was a Type of our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001372_0012_0FB292DE1CE0DA50"/>by Chriſt; therefore Chriſt is called our Paſsover: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 7. <hi>Chriſt our Paſsover is Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced for us.</hi> And it was lawful for men to partake of the Paſsover who were not Regenerated, for it was Gods appointment that the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation ſhould keep it: <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. 47. At the time of the firſt Inſtitution there were very few God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among them, for they are called <hi>an evil Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</hi> And ſo at many other times; yet God threatens thoſe that under any pretence did neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to celebrate the Paſsover, if they were clean and not in a Journey, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9. 13. And <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſent to invite the People of <hi>Ephraim</hi> &amp; <hi>Manaſſeb,</hi> and other Tribes to celebrate the Paſsover, tho' they had lived in Idolatry for ſome Ages, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 1. <hi>And Hezekiah ſent to all Iſrael &amp; Judah, &amp; wrote letters alſo to Ephraim &amp; Manaſſeb, that they ſhould come to the houſe of the Lord at Jeruſalem, to keep the Paſsover to the Lord God of Iſrael.</hi> And Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelf partook of the Paſsover along with Judas: <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 13, 14. <hi>They made ready the Paſsover, and when the hour was come, he ſat down and the twelve Apoſtles with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Offering of Sacrifice:</hi> Many times the whole Congregation of Iſrael offered Sacrifices to the Lord, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. 20, 21. Though multitudes of them were in a natural condition. Any one of the People of Iſrael had his liberty as he ſaw oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to bring his Sacrifice to the Lord, <hi>Lev.</hi> 1. 2. Yea not only the People of Iſrael, but the Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets among them, had a liberty to bring their
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001372_0013_0FB292DFFACDD928"/>Sacrifices, <hi>Lev.</hi> 22. 18, 19. <hi>Wheever he be of the houſe of Iſrael, or of the Strangers in Iſrael that will offer his oblation for all his Vows, and for all his free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will offerings, which they will offer unto the Lord, for a burnt offering: Ye ſhall offer it at your own will, a male without blemiſh.</hi> And in many cafes the People of Iſrael were bound to bring their offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. So the Sin-offerings for Sins of Ignorance, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4. The treſpaſs offerings for Sins wittingly committed, <hi>Lev.</hi> 6. 10. So when they were clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the Leproſy; and in many other caſes: they indeed did it in a very provoking way be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they lived in wickedneſs, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. 20. He tells them, <hi>their offerings were not acceptable, nor their Sacrifices ſweet to him.</hi> But it was lawful for them, whether Regenerate or Unregenerate to bring their Sacrifices.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Officiating in the work of the Prieſt-hood.</hi> The Prieſts beſides teaching of the People, were bound to many other Services: as the offering of their Sacrifices at the brazen Altar; the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the ſhew bread in order; the lighting of the Lamps; the offering of Incenſe; the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in caſes of Leproſy; and in all Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal caſes. But if they were not Regenerate yet it was lawful for them to officiate: If they had any blemiſh they might not, <hi>Lev.</hi> 21. 17. But the want of Regenerating Grace did not make it unlawful for them to officiate. The Prieſt-hood went by lineal deſcent from <hi>Aaron,</hi> it belonged to them by Generation, not by Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration:
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001372_0014_0FB292E1142E9488"/>and it is unreaſonable to think that all the Poſterity of <hi>Aaron</hi> were Regenerate. <hi>Hophni</hi> &amp; <hi>Phineas</hi> were not, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>The Sons of Eli were Sons of Belial, they knew not the Lord.</hi> And the chief Prieſts were principal Enemies to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>III. <hi>Sanctifying Grace is not neceſſary unto the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending ſuch duties of Worſhip, as are peculiar to the times of the New-Teſtament.</hi> There be a few du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Worſhip that are peculiar to theſe times of the New-Teſtament, but there's no peculiar qualifications requiſite in thoſe that do attend them: they agree with the Worſhip in the time of the Old Teſtament, ſo that they are to be attended by the Members of the Viſible Church.</p>
            <p>As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> In Adult perſons, it is needful that there be a profeſſion of Faith &amp; Repentance, morally ſincere, in order to their being Baptiſed. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>They were baptiſed of John in Jordan, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing their Sins:</hi> So the Eunuch before his Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, made confeſſion of Chriſt: <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 37. <hi>I believe that Jeſus Chriſt is the Son of God.</hi> But Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm may be adminiſtred to thoſe who are not Regenerate: It is not to be imagined that all that were Baptiſed by <hi>John</hi> were Regenerate, or judged by him to be ſo; If Regeneration had been neceſſary unto Baptiſm, Chriſt would not have committed that Work to his Diſciples, who were then exceeding raw, <hi>Job.</hi> 4. 1, 2. The Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees <hi>heard that Jeſus made &amp; baptized more Diſciples
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001372_0015_0FB292E274D091A0"/>then John, though Jeſus himſelf baptiſed not but his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> So there were multitudes Baptiſed by <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> in <hi>Samaria;</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> among the reſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 12, 13. And it is the appointment of God that the Children of his viſible People, ſhould be Bapriſed, who are generally at that time in a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural condition. If Unregenerate Perſons might not be Baptiſed, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> would not have been blamed for neglecting Baptiſm: they would have been excuſed, as not prepared for it: but they are condemned for not being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, <hi>Luk.</hi> 7. 30. <hi>The Phariſees &amp; Lawyers rejected the counſel of God againſt themſelves, not being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lords Supper:</hi> No Scandalous perſon may be admitted to Baptiſm, neither may any Scandalous perſon be admitted to the Lords. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; but thoſe that are not Scandalous may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of it, tho' they are not Regenerate. Such perſons as might lawfully come to the Paſsover, may alſo if they have Knowledge to diſcern the Lords-body, lawfully come to the Lords-Supper, for they are alike figures; the Paſsover was a type of Chriſt to dye; the Lords-Supper is a repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Chriſt who has dyed: It is lawful for Unregenerate men to celebrate the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the death of Chriſt, which is a great incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement &amp; comfort unto them; and ſo they do in this Ordinance: It is lawful for Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate men to give a Solemn Teſtimony to the vertue of the death of Chriſt, and ſhew it forth;
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001372_0016_0FB292E414FF2328"/>and ſo they do in this Ordinance, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>Ye ſhew forth the Lords Death till be come.</hi> That which God teaches us in this Ordinance, is very needful for Unregenerate men to learn; name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the inſufficiency of all other things beſides the death of Chriſt for Salvation, and the alſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of Chriſt for Salvation: that which we profeſs in this Ordinance is very fit for Unrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men to profeſs; namely the need of Chriſt, and ſaving vertue of his blood: as it may be of great advantage to natural men to hear Gods Promiſe in the Covenant of Grace. So to ſee God ſetting his Seal to the Covenant of Grace. If it be lawful for all the Adult Members of the Church to partake of the Lords-Supper, then it is lawful for ſome Unregenerate men to do it: but it is lawful for all the Adult Members of the Church to do it: this was the practice in the primitive Church, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>We are all parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of that one bread:</hi> If it be lawful for the Church to require Unregenerate perſons to come to the Lords Supper, then it is lawful for them to come; but it is lawful for the Church to require all its Adult Members to keep the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God: If it be lawful for an Ungenerate man to be in Covenant with God, it is lawful for them to come to the Lords Supper, for if it be lawful for them to be in Covenant, it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them to keep Covenant: If Sanctification were a neceſſary qualification to partaking in the Lords Supper, than it would be a very Sinful.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001372_0017_0FB292E5F68BCA78"/>thing for any unſanctifyed perſon to come, tho' he hoped he was Godly, tho' he was conſident of his Godlineſs. When Chriſt Inſtituted this Ordinance, He commanded his Diſciples to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 19. Therefore it is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to be attended by the whole Church, by all the Diſciples of Chriſt, that have Knowledge. If Sanctification were a neceſſary qualification, in order to partaking, then the Church ſhould let no others come, and then God would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them a certain Rule in attending of which, they might keep all others away. Men had need have good arguments to make the World believe, that coming to the Lords Table is a priviledge equally confined with Juſtification, Adoption and eternal Glory; and that none may venture to the Lords Table, but thoſe that ſhall be admitted into the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Officiating in the work of the Goſpel Miniſtry:</hi> If a man do know himſelf to be Unregenerate, yet it is lawful for him to adminiſter Baptiſm and the Lords Supper. The bleſſing of this Ordinance does not depend upon the Piety of him that doth adminiſter it. Chriſt knew <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> to be Unregenerate, yet he let him as well as the reſt of the Diſciples to adminiſter Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Joſus baptized not but his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</hi> If men be deſtitute of Regenerating Grace, yet they may adminiſter Gods Ordinances in ſuch a manner as may be for the glory of God, and the Edification of his People. It is moſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001372_0018_0FB292E704863018"/>deſirable upon all accounts that they who Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate in the work of the Miniſtry, be holy and gracious men: but men that are deſtitute of Grace are not prohibited in the word of God to adminiſter the Ordinances of God, if ſuch may Preach ſurely they may adminiſter Sacraments. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Preaching as a greater work than adminiſtring. Baptiſm, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17. And we may argue that it is greater than adminiſtring the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p>The Reaſons of the Doctrine we,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>There is no certain, knowledge who have Sanctifying Grace.</hi> If we ſhould be limited by God, ſo that we might admit none to Church fellowſhip, but ſuch as have Sanctifying Grace, we ſhould be under extream difficulties &amp; great ſcruples of Conſcience; for if we make the moſt exact ſearch, we ſhould often be very much miſtaken, and in danger to accept of ſome that were not ſincere, and to reject ſome that were ſincere. There is no certain rule given in the Scripture to the guides of the Church, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they can diſtinguiſh Saints from Hypocrites; neither do many Perſons know what to make of themſelves: Some that are Godly have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny fears whether their hearts be right in the ſight of God: which is implyed in that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Give all diligence to make your Calling and your Election ſure.</hi> And many Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crites have a great conſidence that they are Saints, <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 40. <hi>Are we blind alſo?</hi> It is not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001372_0019_0FB292E8819BD5B0"/>to be imagined that God would give a Rule to his People that is impracticable: If that were the Rule that only Godly men, were to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to communion in the Church, there is not knowledge enough upon Earth in order to the practice of it: the Church through their ignorance muſt wholly forbear acting: for their knowledge of other mens Piety is but a ſuppoſition, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5. 12. <hi>By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I ſuppoſe.</hi> And particular Perſons, would never be able to attend that Rule for want of the knowledge of themſelves; ſome would exclude themſelves, and others would obtrude themſelves contrary to it, ſo that the Rule would come to nothing. Gods Rules are ſuch that no man has any juſt cauſe to object againſt them: but if this were the Rule that Godly men only might enjoy Ordinances; the Church might object, that it is Gods preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to know the hearts of men, and we are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly uncapable to attend that Rule.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is needful that others ſhould attend duties of Worſhip, that the Worſhip of God may be carryed on.</hi> In the flouriſhing times of the Church, that will hold, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20. 16. <hi>Many are called and few are choſen:</hi> but there be degenerate times, when Religion runs very low among the People of God; and at ſuch a time, there is a great ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Godly men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12. 1. <hi>The Godly man ceaſeth, the faithful fail from among the Children of men.</hi> Iſai. 53. 1. <hi>Who hath believed our Repors,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:001372_0020_0FB292E9F5DC8360"/>
               <hi>and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed.</hi> It may be there may be but two or three ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in a Pariſh: in ſome Countrys eſpecially Godly men are very thin ſown: and if the reſt muſt be excluded from any part of the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God, how can it be carryed on, how can they ſhew forth the Lords Death till he come? Yea if none but holy men muſt Offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in the Church; they would be neceſſitated many times to be deſtitute of Miniſters: in ſome Countrys eſpecially it would be a difficult thing to find men qualifyed with Sanctifying Grace. Sometimes there is a great ſcarcity of Godly Magiſtrates: <hi>Jer.</hi> 5. 1. <hi>Run to and fro through the Streets of Jeruſalem, and ſee now &amp; know and ſeek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if there be any that executeth Judgment, that ſeeketh the truth, and I will pardon it.</hi> So many times there is a great ſcarcity of Godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 3. <hi>Do not after their works, for they ſay and do not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>This is very uſeful that men may obtain Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Grace.</hi> If men have it not now yet it will be a wonderful Mercy if they can obtain it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they dye: and the attending duties of Worſhip is very ſerviceable to that end. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are in the way to be gained, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 29. 9. <hi>In his Temple doth every one ſpeak of his glory.</hi> It is a bleſſed thing to be waiting upon God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 34. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that beareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the poſts of my doors.</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:001372_0021_0FB292EC985A5448"/>The giving of Converting Grace is not Timit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any one Ordinance. Prayer is very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable that way, <hi>Prov.</hi> 2. 3. <hi>If thou cryeſt after knowledge and lifteſt up thy voice for underſtanding.</hi> So the Hearing of the Word is very ſerviceable. The entrance of God's Word giveth light. So the Sacraments are very uſeful for Converſion: God teaches us in Baptiſm that we are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally polluted, and that we need to be cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the blood of Chriſt. God in the Lords Supper in vites us to come to Chriſt, makes an affecting repreſentation of his Sufferings for our Sins, teſtifies the Sufficiency of Chriſt: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the truth of the Covenant of Grace, teaches us that the Promiſe of Salvation to thoſe that believe in Chriſt is certain; all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are Seals of the Covenant, as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion was: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>The attending of theſe duties are part of the External Covenant:</hi> The Covenant People of God are bound to attend Covenant duties. If any part of the External Covenant be neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the Covenant is broken. The Covenant that God makes with his Viſible People ought to be attended, the Viſible People of God have a natural power to attend thoſe duties, &amp; they have a legal power to attend them: they may attend them lawfully: There is no part of the external Covenant, but it may be kept by the Viſible Church, therefore they have power to qualify themſelves ſufficiently, in order to the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001372_0022_0FB292EF86D11630"/>attending of them: but if Sanctifying Grace were neceſſary in order to the lawful attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, than it would be out of their power.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The USE of this Doctrine is of Warning; That you be not afraid to attend duties of Worſhip, becauſe deſtitute of Sanctifying Grace.</hi> Men that are deſtitute of Sanctifying Grace can perform no duty in an acceptable manner: but yet you muſt not give way to a ſpirit of fear, ſo as to neglect your duty. Men muſt be afraid to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it and not afraid to attend it: You muſt make haſte to get Sanctifying Grace, but you muſt not deny God any part of his Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, till that is done. It is a poor thing for men to be ſcared into Religion, but it is ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed for men to be ſcared out of Religion, &amp; to neglect Gods Worſhip out of fear of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>There be two things that make men neglect the Lords-Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some deſpiſe it, they don't find any need of it; their deſign is the World and their pleaſures; and they don't regard the Lords-Supper.</hi> There is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane Spirit prevailing in the Land; and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men neglect the Lords-Supper from the ſame reaſon, that they neglect Secret Prayer: <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe they do deſpiſe holy things, they don't regard communion with God, nor help and advantages to Eternal Life: they are far from that Spirit that <hi>David</hi> had, Who ſaid, <hi>One thing have I deſired, and that I will ſeek after, that I may dwell in the houſe of the Lord all the dayes of

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Some are afraid of it.</hi> They are deſirous to do any thing that they can for the promotion of their Salvation; but they are afraid to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that Ordinance. It is with them as it was with <hi>David,</hi> 2 Sam. 6. 9. <hi>And David was afraid of the Lord that day, &amp; ſaid, how ſhad the Ark of the Lord come to we.</hi> They have drunk in an opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that none but Converted, Perſons ſhould come to that Ordinance, and ſo they neglect in: they have been miſ-informed about it, and ſo dare not come: But they ſhould not be afraid to attend that Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Conſider 1. <hi>Thoſe who diſcourage Perſons from coming to it, becauſe Unconverted, do in their zeal make others to ceaſe from fearing the Lord.</hi> As the <hi>Reubenites</hi> and <hi>Gaditer</hi> did argue in ſome what alike caſe, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22. 23, 24. The neglecting outward Worſhip is the way to neglect inward Worſhip. Staying from Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances is not the way to fit men for Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces: the neglecting of the Sacrament is the way to make the Country grow prophane. Gods Ordinances are the means to advance Religion. If they neglect Prayer, it would hinder them from fearing the Lord; if they neglect Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word; if they neglect Baptiſm; ſo likewiſe if they neglect the Lords Supper: it will prove no advantage to Religion to neglect any of God's Ordinances; the ſolemn attending
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001372_0024_0FB292F8CFD39708"/>of Gods Ordinances lead men into a ſence of the need of Chriſt, and benefit of Chriſt. The limitting of the Lords Supper to a ſmall num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, has a tendency to nouriſh carnal conſidence in them that are admitted, and to nouriſh pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs in them that are excluded.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>There can be no ſufficient reaſon aſſigned, why thoſe who are deſtitute of Sanctifying Grace, ſhould be debarred from the Lords Supper.</hi> The holineſs of the Ordinance can be no reaſon: for circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion and the Paſsover were holy Ordinances, yet many Unregenerate Perſons did partake of them. Baptiſm is an holy Ordinance, yet it may be adminiſtred to Unregenerate men: the ſignification of the Lords Supper can be no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, it ſignifies Chriſt as Suffering for our Sins; the Bread is the ſign of his Body, and the Wine the ſign of his Blood. So the Water in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, is a ſign of the Blood of Chriſt, yet may be applyed to Unregenerate Perſons. The ſign of Chriſt crucifyed is of great uſe to put them in mind of Chriſt's Sufferings for us: Its being a Seal of the Covenant is no reaſon, it is of great uſe to them to ſee God Sealing his Covenant. As it is of uſe for God to declare his Covenant, ſo to ſee God Sealing his Covenant: the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony that is given to Chriſt in this Ordinance can be no reaſon, it is very fit that they as well as others ſhould ſhew forth his Death.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Many that judge that Perſons ſhould be Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before they come to the Sacrament, do run into a
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001372_0025_0FB292F9C864E148"/>great fault, viz.</hi> they perſwade Perſons that they are Converted before they are: they are zealous againſt mens coming to the Lords-Supper in an Unconverted condition, yet adviſe &amp; incou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage ſuch perſons to come under a notion that they are Converted; if perſons do but carry civilly &amp; religiouſly, they think they are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and urge them to joyn to the Church; hereby abundance of wrong is done; men are greatly hardned in a natural Eſtate: and they are laid under great Temptation to flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, as if the bitterneſs of death were paſt: this is a means to prevent many mens Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; if men are made to believe that they are Godly before they be, that is like to prove a mighty impediment unto their Converſion, they don't lye open to the threatnings of the Word, they think others ſpoken to, and they pity them; but they are not ſenſible of their own danger: <hi>Joh.</hi> 9. 41. <hi>Becauſe you ſay, you ſee, therefore your ſin remaineth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>If none that are deſtitute of Sanctifying Grace may come, than two ſorts of Perſons that do come ſhould ſtay away.</hi> Firſt, ſuch perſons as are in a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral condition, yet have got a confidence that they are Converted: there are many ſuch. <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 12. <hi>There is a Generation that are pure in their own eyes, yet are not cleanſed from their filthineſs:</hi> But there is no way to keep them from it, the Church can't keep them from it, becauſe they are viſible Saints: and their own Conſciences will not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001372_0026_0FB292FB6E03D8A0"/>them, becauſe they are confident that they are Converted. And Secondly, there is another ſort that ſhould forbear, <hi>viz.</hi> Such Godly men as do not know that they are Converted. If a man be Godly, yet how can he with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience come to an Ordinance, peculiar to God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men, when he don't know himſelf to be God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: if only Saints are allowed to come, he muſt know himſelf to be a Saint, before he can know that he is allowed of God to come. As if a man has power to Sell nothing but what is his own, then he muſt know a thing to be his own before be can sell it with a good Conſcience. Or if a Church have power to conſure only Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous perſons, then they muſt know a man to be Scandalous before they can with a good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience cenſure him. So in this caſe, if the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament be only for Godly men, they dont know that they have any right to it, until they know that they are Godly.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>It is from the miſunderſtanding of one Scripture principally, that theſe are afraid to come to the Lords<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Supper:</hi> viz. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. There are two expreſſions in that Chapter that they are terrifyed with, One that <hi>He that eateth &amp; drinketh unworthily, is guilty of the body &amp; blood of the Lord:</hi> that is of propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Ordinance. And they are ſaid <hi>to eat &amp; drink damnation or judgment to themſelves:</hi> but this unworthy eating is doing of it in a rude manner, as <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>For in eating every one taketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore others his own Supper, and one is hungry &amp; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001372_0027_0FB292FCD8C431D8"/>is drunken.</hi> And he explains himſelf, v. 29. <hi>Not diſcerning the Lords body;</hi> that is, not diſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that bread from common bread. Another expreſſion is, <hi>Let a man examine himſelf &amp; ſo let him eat, v.</hi> 28. But it is not ſaid, Let him examine himſelf whether he ſhould eat or forbear, <hi>but let him Examine himſelf, &amp; ſo let him eat.</hi> The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, that he muſt come ſolemnly to that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, Examining what need he has of it.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>The Church is bound to receive men if they be externally qualifyed, whether they be Godly or no.</hi> If men make a profeſſion &amp; are not Scandalous in their Converſation, the Church cannot refuſe them. The Apoſtle ſtill received thoſe that made a profeſſion of the Goſpel, <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 41. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 7. Thoſe that are Saints by calling are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of the Church, whether they be Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or not. The matter of the Church are vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Saints: if the Church were only to receive thoſe that are Converted, God would have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them a certain rule, in attending of which Unconverted Perſons ſhould be excluded, but there is no ſuch Rule given: Neither is there any external ſign, that does certainly diſtinguiſh Converted men from Unconverted; the Church is not concerned to ſee that they be all real Saints, their work is to ſee they be viſible Saints, if they reject ſuch they are to blame.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>It cannot be an unlawful thing for men to keep the External Covenant.</hi> As the viſible People of God have a natural power, ſo they have a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001372_0028_0FB292FFD53A43E0"/>power to keep the External Covenant. if they keep the External Covenant they are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as a righteous People, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6. 25. <hi>It ſhall be our righteouſneſs if we obſerve to do all theſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi> If they neglect to do any part of the Covenant, they lay themſelves open to the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God. God brings War to avenge the quarrel of his Covenant; and this is one part of Gods Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 10. Circumciſion is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Covenant. So this is one branch of the Covenant. It is required in the ſecond Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, That we worſhip God in that way which he has appointed: and this is the appointment of God, that his whole viſible Church do cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate the Memorial of the Death of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. <hi>We being many do all partake of that one bread.</hi> And indeed it is the duty of the Church to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire all its Adult orderly Members to come to the Lords-Supper, and it would be very ſtrange that it ſhould be the duty of the Church to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire them to come, &amp; cenſure them for not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and yet be their duty to ſtay away becauſe Unconverted.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>It is exceeding ſtrange that it ſhould be the Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, that only Converted Perſons ſhould come to the Lords-Supper, and yet no more care taken that that Inſtitution ſhould be attended.</hi> If it were Gods will that no Unconverted Perſons ſhould come, it is much that he does not charge his Church to uſe their utmoſt endeavours to diſcover Secret Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and to keep them out of the Church,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001372_0029_0FB29301618E7828"/>and that he don't command them to pluck up all the Tares that they can diſcover among the Wheat; as was propoſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. 28. And is it not much that he does not charge Unconverted men, not to meddle with thoſe holy things? &amp; tell them that they muſt content themſelves with Praying &amp; Faſting, and Hearing &amp; being Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, but proceed no further: but we find no ſuch injunctions in the Scripture.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>We have no cauſe to wonder to find ſome Divines of our own Nation, and ſome of other Nations to deny that the Supper is a Converting Ordinance.</hi> I find <hi>Wendiline,</hi> a great Divine in his diſputations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Lutherans</hi> acknowledging again &amp; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, that the Sacraments may inſtrumentally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Faith in Adult Perſons; &amp; in another place, ſaying, That the Sacraments of confirmation; he means the Paſsover, and the Lords-Supper may organically begin Faith. Yet there be a great many Divines that do deny this. But this is not to be wondred at, ſeeing they hold, That Elect Infants that have faederal holineſs, have at the ſame time the internal grace of Regeneration. Thus <hi>Voetius Statu. Elect. Unte. Conv.</hi> And he ſays, That Dr. <hi>Burges</hi> does prove by many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, that Elect Infants have an initial &amp; ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Regeneration upon their Baptiſm; if it were ſo, no doubt but their actual Converſion would be in early days, before they come to that Age, when perſons are wont to be admitted to the Lords Supper.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:001372_0030_0FB29302D6356CC0"/>
10. <hi>No Chriſtian Country does neglect this Ordinance no we do in this Land.</hi> In our own Nation at home, ſo in <hi>Scotland, Holland, Denmark, Sweedland,</hi> and among the Proteſtants in <hi>Germany</hi> &amp; <hi>France,</hi> they do generally Celebrate the Memorial of Chriſts Death. This Country is ſingular in neglecting of it. About Forty years paſt, there were a Multitude in the Country, Unbaptized: but that neglect was taken into Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and now there is an alteration in that parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. But to this day there be Four to One that do neglect the Lords-Supper; as if it did not belong to them to magnify God upon the account of the Work of Redemption. We are a People that pretend high in Religion, but indeed we fall ſhort of other People in the very Form of it, and don't come up in our practice in this particular to many other Churches.</p>
            <p n="11">11. <hi>The general neglect of this Ordinance is a viſible denying of the Goſpel.</hi> Chriſt has threatned to <hi>deny them before his Father, that do deny him before men,</hi> Mat. 10. 33. And the neglect of this Inſtitution is a viſible denyal of Chriſt. Our buſineſs at the Lords Supper is to Celebrate the Memorial of Chriſts Death, &amp; to give our Teſtimony to the Goſpel: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 26. <hi>As often as ye eat this Bread, &amp; drink this cup, ye ſhew forth the Lords death till he come.</hi> They therefore that do neglect to do this, do with-hold their Teſtimony. They act as if they did not believe the Doctrine to be true. What conſtruction can be put upon it, but that they are unconcerned to give their Teſtimony to Chriſt, and queſtion the truth of the Goſpel; it is an open reproaching of Chriſt, &amp; a viſible contempt of the Goſpel? This neglect has a great tendency, to ſtrengthen &amp; confirm others in their Infidelity; for they act as if they did not believe it. And many Children when they are reproved for their Infidelity,
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001372_0031_0FB29304AD845418"/>have that excuſe for themſelves, That their Fathers and Mothers do not believe the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="12">12. <hi>The neglect of this Ordinance is one great cauſe of Gods Judgments.</hi> We are under ſorrowful diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and have reaſon to conclude this neglect to be one eſpecial cauſe of them. There be indeed abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Moral Evils in the Land, that do provoke God to anger: but generally when God brought Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on Iſrael, it was mainly for corruptions in Worſhip. As we may not introduce Ceremonies of mens Invention, ſo we muſt not neglect Ordinances that are of Divine Inſtitution. Neglects of Worſhip bring deſtroying Judgments: <hi>Exod.</hi> 5. 3. <hi>Let us Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Lord our God, lest he fall upon us with Pestilence, or with Sword.</hi> Let men have what pretences they will, yet thoſe pretences will not excuſe them in the neglect of Gods Ordinances. God don't allow men to be ſcared out of his Worſhip. But I do judge that the generality that do neglect it, do it out of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and prophane Spirit, and then it is no wonder, if it brings down the Wrath of God.</p>
            <p>It is Objected by ſome againſt this Doctrine, <hi>That if the Lords-Supper be a Converting Ordinance, then not only ſuch as are Civil &amp; Religious may be admitted to it, but prophane &amp; vicious Perſons for they likewiſe need Converſion, &amp; it is pity but they ſhould have all helps to Converſion?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A. 1. <hi>That Baptiſm is a Converting Ordinance, but yet is not to be administred to Adult Perſons that are prophane:</hi> For Baptiſm is only a Converting Ordinance to the Members of the Church, who are Unconverted. The Hearing of the Word only is the appointed means for the Converſion of others.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Lords Supper is an Ordinance for the ſtrengthening &amp; exerciſing of Grace:</hi> yet it doth not follow that it is to be adminiſtred to Godly men, who are guilty of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:001372_0032_0FB2930699D5C500"/>Scandal, the need that they have to have their Grace ſtrengthned, is no argument that the Lords-Supper ſhould in that caſe he adminiſtred to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Though the Lord Supper is a Converting Ordinance, yet it is not to be adminiſtred to any prophane &amp; vicious men:</hi> For it is a Converting Ordinance only to thoſe that it is appointed to be adminiſtred unto; <hi>viz</hi> Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church walking orderly. When Church Members carry Scandalous, there are other Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appointed for their Converſion, in caſe they be Unconverted.</p>
            <p>It is alſo Objected, <hi>That theſe who were Unclean were not to partake of the Passover,</hi> Numb. 9 7 <hi>which ſeems to hold forth to us. That thoſe that are ſpiritually Unclean in the dayes of the Goſpel, may not partake of the Lords-Supper?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A 1. <hi>If thoſe that were ſpiritually Unclean might come to the Passover, no reaſon can be aſſigned why they may not alſo come to the Lords Supper:</hi> For the Paſsover was an holy Ordinance as well as the Lords Supper; and the Paſsover ought to be attended in an holy manner, as well as the Supper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Ordinances of the Old Teſtament were not Types of the Ordinances of the New-Teſtament.</hi> If the reaſon why the Unclean might not come to the Paſsover was to ſignify that thoſe who were Unregenerate might not come to the Lords-Supper: of what Edification would that Inſtitution be to the Jews. They did not underſtand any ſuch meaning, &amp; if they had, it would have done them no good. But the Ordinances of the Old Teſtament did ſignify Evangelical Doctrines, which were of great uſe to the Jews, ſo this appointment, that Unclean Perſons might not come to the Paſsover did ſignify, that thoſe who were ſpiritually Unclean, ſhould not have communion with God in the higheſt Heaven, but be Excluded out of the Kingdom of GOD.</p>
