            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

quickning Motive can I offer to excite you to this Duty, than my Text affords us; the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the frailty of Man reſpecting his firſt Birth, and as he is a Child of apoſtate <hi>Adam;</hi> and of the immortal Life he is begotten to, when he receiveth the incorruptible Seed of the Word of God into his Heart, of that God who liveth and abideth for ever.</p>
            <p>Here then we may conſider from the Words the following Obſervations,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Man is Fleſh; weak and frail as the Graſs. II. All the Glory of Man is as the Flower of Graſs. III. As ſuch a fading Creature he withers &amp; falls by Death. IV. The Word of the Lord endureth for ever. V. This is the Word which by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel is preached unto you.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Man is Fleſh; weak and frail as the Graſs.</hi> Man is call'd Fleſh. <hi>All Fleſh has corrupted his Way upon the Earth,</hi> Gen. 6. 12. Such is his Body, and his Soul is defil'd with fleſhly Luſts. <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh,</hi> Joh. 3.6. Indeed in his original Conſtitution, Man had not the Seeds of Corruption ſown in his Nature; no, <hi>Adam</hi> was made in God's Image, and after his Likeneſs; a Candidate for a bleſſed Immortality: But when he had tranſgreſs'd his Maker's Law by eating the forbidden Fruit, that Threatning was denounc'd, <hi>Duſt thou art, and unto Duſt thou ſhalt return,</hi> Gen. 3. 19 As Graſs Man ſprings out of the Earth, being form'd out of the Duſt reſpecting his Body. It's true, his Body was at firſt, a noble Structure in which <hi>Adam</hi> appear'd in excellent Majeſty as the Head over the brute Creation. And here the meaneſs of the Materials out of which he was form'd was a ſoil to the divine Power and Skill of the

                  </gap>perabat opus.</note> And even ſince the Fall has mar'd God's Workmanſhip, impair'd the Strength, and defac'd the Beauty of it; ſtill there's reaſon to ſing the Praiſes of our Maker in the Words of the royal Pſalmiſt, <hi>I will praiſe thee, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made,</hi> Pſal. 139. 14. And I may add, no leſs wonderfully preſerved; for as the Graſs, our Life is now exceeding frail, and liable to be blaſted by every Wind. <hi>As for Man his Days are as Graſs: as a Flower of the Field, ſo be flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. For the Wind paſſeth over it, and it is gone; and the Place thereof ſhall know it no more,</hi> Pſal. 103.15, 16. And accordingly as Graſs, when Man has ſtood for a little time, he falls to the Earth, and in his Diſſolution returns to it. Even ſuch as are now in their Verdure, may ſay, the time of our Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is at Hand. For what is <hi>your Life?</hi> It is even a <hi>Vapour</hi> that appeareth for a little time, and then vaniſheth away. <hi>Surely the People is Graſs,</hi> Iſai. 40. 7. All Orders of Men, whether they be high or low, rich or poor, young or old, agree in this; they are all as Graſs, frail dying Creatures. And this leads me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>All the Glory of Man is as the Flower of Graſs, Verily every Man at his beſt State is altogether vanity,</hi> Pſal. 39. 5. Suppoſe him to be flouriſhing in Beauty, Health, and the moſt agreable outward Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Wealth, Honour, Friends, and the like; in all this Glory, Man is but a fading Flower, like the <hi>Lilies</hi> of the Field. Yea, this Compariſon is not too low for <hi>Solomon</hi> in all his Glory; for our Lord aſſureth us, <hi>he was not arayed like one of theſe,</hi> Mat. 6. 29. Even theſe Works of God which are to Day, and to Morrow are caſt into the Oven, appear with inimitable Luſtre in their fine and beautiful Colours, vaſtly exceeding all humane Art. But
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004802_0006_100DF1B14ED89150"/>
why do we ſet our Eyes upon that which is not? While we behold this periſhing Creature, it fadeth and vaniſheth away. <hi>Surely Men of high Degree are a lie: to be laid in the Balance, they are altogether lighter than vanity,</hi> Pſal. 62. 9. Which brings me to the third Head,</p>
            <p n="3">III. <hi>As ſuch a frail Creature, Man withereth, and falls by Death.</hi> As the Flower of the Graſs he paſſeth away. <hi>For the Sun is no ſooner riſen with a burning heat, but it withereth the Graſs, and the Flower thereof falleth, and the Grace of the faſhion of it periſheth,</hi> Jam. I. II. So do we fade away. <hi>My Days are like a Shadow that declineth: and I am withered like Graſs,</hi> Pſal. 102. 11. How feeble are we from our Birth! How brittle is our Conſtitution! We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to die as ſoon as we begin to live. We are continually changing and wearing away as we paſs the different Scenes of Life, and at Death that Word is fulfil'd, <hi>Thou prevaileſt for ever againſt him, and he paſſeth: thou changeſt his Countenance, and ſendeſt him away,</hi> Job 14. 20. Almoſt every thing we converſe with in this paſſing World would teach us this plain Truth. Particularly, our <hi>daily Food.</hi> We live upon the Dead. The Fleſh of brute Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures fed with Graſs and then ſlain, is a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Part of our Livelihood. And can a Life thus ſupported endure always? No ſurely. Every Meal puts us in Mind of thoſe Words, <hi>Meats for the Belly, and the Belly for Meats; but God ſhall deſtroy both it and them,</hi> 1 Cor. 6. 13. How careful then ſhould we be to glorify God, whether we eat or drink? How watchful over our ſelves, leſt by any Exceſſes we ſhould further ſhorten this frail Life? And how earneſt ſhould we be in ſeeking the living Bread which came down from Heaven, that we may eat and live for ever? Even the Fleſh of the Son of God, which he hath Given for the Life of the World. O <hi>labour, not for the Meat which pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, but for that Meat which endureth unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

Life.</hi> But it's time I return from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. We may each one of us ſay with <hi>Job, Is my Strength the Strength of Stones? or is my Fleſh of Braſs?</hi> No, it is much more fitly compar'd to the Graſs. Our Fleſh is a little mouldring looſe Earth, ſoon crumbled and broken to Pieces. O frail Man! why doſt thou boaſt thy ſelf in Vanity? Let the ſerious Conſideration of thy haſtening Diſſolution hide Pride from thee. You may ſay <hi>to Corruption,</hi> Thou <hi>art my Father;</hi> to the <hi>Worm,</hi> Thou art <hi>my Mother,</hi> and <hi>my Siſter.</hi> Glory not then in thy Strength or Beauty, Wealth or Honour; but rather lie down in the Duſt before the Lord of Life, and bewail thy Sin which hath ſtain'd thy Glory with the Shadow of Death, and turn'd thy Beauty into Corruption. <hi>Bury my Dead out of my Sight.</hi> And yet again I ſay to thee, Lift up thy Head, and behold thy Saviour offering to raiſe you to an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Life by his Word and Spirit, a Life much better than that which you forfeited and loſt by the original Apoſtacy. O that this may be the Hour in which ſuch as are dead in Sins ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and live!</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>The Word of the Lord endureth for ever.</hi> Now this is here ſpoken in oppoſition to the frail periſhing Condition of Man, conſider him in his unregenerate State, and as born of the Fleſh. As he proceeds from the <hi>firſt Adam,</hi> he is altogether Vanity, and whatever appears excellent in him, muſt ſoon vaniſh away; but then in the Word, CHRIST the <hi>ſecond Adam</hi> is reveal'd and offer'd to us, who hath aboliſhed Death, and brought Life and Immortality to Light by the Goſpel; and we have a new and living Way open'd to Glory and Bleſſedneſs. Sin is expiated by one perfect Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our great High Prieſt, God-Man; and the Holy Spirit purchas'd to ſanctity God's People, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004802_0008_100DF1B5B5A93690"/>
ſo prepare them for eternal Life in Heaven. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably we read that God's People are <hi>born again not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God, which liveth and abideth for ever.</hi> ver. 23. Context. When the <hi>Son</hi> of God who is the <hi>eſſential and eternal Word</hi> is pleas'd to make uſe of the <hi>Word written,</hi> and accompany it with the divine Influence of his Spirit; then the Word of God is quick and powerful, it is Spirit and Life; the bleſſed Mean of be getting a new and ſpiritual Life in God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and of nouriſhing it to eternal Life. Of the Son, who is call'd the <hi>Word of God,</hi> Rev. 19. 13. it may be ſaid in the higheſt Senſe, that he liveth and abideth for ever, reſpecting his Divine Nature. This true &amp; faithful Witneſs declareth, <hi>I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning &amp; the ending, ſaith the Lord, which is, &amp; which was, and which is to come,</hi> Rev. 1. 8. And as Mediator, God <hi>has given him Power over all Fleſh, that be ſhould give eternal Life to as many as thou baſt given him,</hi> Joh. 17. 2. Indeed I do not ſay that the Word is here nextly to be underſtood of the Son of God perſonally; but then it is to be underſtood of the Word of the Goſpel as it is the Word of Chriſt, and as it is breath'd into the Hearts of his People by his Spirit. And this Name ſeems to have been given to our Lord Jeſus, not only as God utter'd his mighty Voice by him, and ſpake the World into being. <hi>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The ſame was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any Thing made that was made,</hi> Joh 1. 1, to 3. But alſo as God <hi>ſpeaks</hi> to his People the <hi>Word of Life by him,</hi> and <hi>createth</hi> the <hi>new Heavens and the new Earth, Wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs.</hi> Accordingly, thoſe Words Heb. 4. 12. <hi>For the Word of God is quick, and powerful, and ſharper than any two-edged Sword, pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing even to the dividing aſunder of Soul and Spirit,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004802_0009_100DF1B74428C220"/>
and of the Joynts and Marrow, and is a diſcerner of the Thoughts and Intent of the Heart;</hi> are by ſome underſtood as ſpoken of the <hi>eſſential Word,</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; by others of the <hi>written Word.</hi> I humbly conceive that the full Senſe of the Place comprehends both Interpretations, and may well be underſtood of the Goſpel of Chriſt, as ſpoken to the Heart by him, when it becomes Spirit &amp; Life to dead Souls.</p>

But to return, after this the Word of God was written by <hi>Moſes</hi> and other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired Pen-men. Our Lord owns the Writings of the <hi>Old Teſtiment</hi> in uſe in his Day, as authentick.

This Foundation of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Prophets,</hi> wherein <hi>Chriſt</hi> is reveal'd and doctrinally exhibited as the <hi>chief Corner Stone,</hi> none could ever remove.

begat he us with the Word of Truth,</hi> Jam. 1. 18. <hi>Which were born, not of Blood, nor of the will of the Fleſh, nor of the will of Man, but of God,</hi> Joh. 1. 13. And this Work is particularly aſcrib'd to the third Perſon in the Godhead, the Holy Spirit. <hi>Except a Man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the Kingdom of God,</hi> Joh. 3 5. Ver. 6. <hi>That which is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh; and that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi> We are ſav'd by the waſhing of Regeneration, when we are renew'd by the Holy Ghoſt in the Spirit of our Minds. And as the divine Author is the Spirit of God, ſo the Work is ſpiritual. In this new Birth there are holy Inclinations, and vital Principles of Grace wrought in the Soul. Look upon the Man in a natural or phyſical Senſe, and he is the ſame Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as before Converſion; but in a ſpiritual Senſe, he is a new Creature. 2 Cor. 5. 17. <hi>If any Man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature: old Things are paſt away, behold, all Things are become new.</hi> There's a <hi>new Light</hi> in the Undeſtanding to diſcern ſpiritual Objects after a ſpiritual Manner, a <hi>new Biaſs</hi> on the Will and Affections, whereby they are turn'd from Sin to God. And ſuch may fitly be ſaid to be born of God; for there's ſpiritual <hi>Life</hi> commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, even a Power of ſpiritual Perceptions, Operations and Enjoyments; and alſo ſpiritual <hi>Likeneſs,</hi> it is after the Image of God in Knowlege and Holineſs. <hi>The new Man, which after God is created in Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs,</hi> Eph. 4.24. <hi>The new Man, which is renewed in Knowledge, after the Image of him that created him,</hi> Col 3.10 Furthermore, as God's People are begotten through the Goſpel, (1 Cor. 4. 15.) ſo by the ſame Word is the Work carried on till the Children of God grow up to the Stature of perfect Men in Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>We all with open Face, beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from

Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 18. While the People of God behold the Glory of the Lord in the clear Glaſs of the Goſpel, they paſs on from one Degree of glorious Grace to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, till Grace is perfected in the beatific Viſion. While the outward Man decays, and the Beauties of Fleſh and Blood fade, the new Creature ſhineth more and more to the perfect Day, till the <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous ſhall ſhine forth as the Sun, in the Kingdom of their Father,</hi> Matth. 13. 43. When the Seed of the Goſpel is ſown in the Heart, and takes Root there, being mix'd with Faith, and receiv'd in Love; it ſprings up, and bears Fruit to Life eternal, not a fading Flower, but a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away. This Seed of God remains in the Heart. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remaineth in him: and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 9. The Words can't intend that God's People in this Life have no remains of Sin in them. Scripture and ſad Experience teſtify the contrary.

Thus as God's People have born the Image of the <hi>earthy,</hi> they ſhall alſo bear the Image of the <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Adam,</hi> that bleſſed Man, who is the great God our Saviour. <hi>For our Converſation is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, from whence alſo we look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: who ſhall change our vile Body, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glorious Body, according to the working whereby he is able to ſubdue all Things unto himſelf,</hi> Phil. 3. 20, 1. Nor can it be in any Meaſure difficult to infinite Knowledge &amp; Power, ſo to order all Events relating to the Bodies of his People buried in the Earth, or ſunk in the Sea, that every one ſhall have his own Body without the leaſt Confuſion. Behold, Life and Immortality brought to Light thro' the Goſpel! Behold fallen Man rais'd to a State of conſummate Glory and Bleſſedneſs, by the Word of God! <hi>They which ſhall be accounted wortby to obtain that World, and the Reſurrection from the Dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage. Neither can they die any more; for they are equal unto the Angels, and are the Children of God, being the Children of the Reſurrection,</hi> Luk. 20 35, 6.</p>

            <p>We need not inquire, as at a loſs about the Way of Life, Who ſhall aſcend into Heaven to bring Chriſt down from above?

The Word delivered by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> to God's ancient People; is here confirm'd by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, The Voice ſaid, Cry. And he ſaid, What ſhall I cry? All Fleſh is Graſs, and all the goodlineſs thereof is as the Flower of the Field. The Graſs withereth, the Flower fadeth; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Spirit of the Lord bloweth upon it: ſurely the People is Graſs. Tbe Graſs withereth, the Flower fadeth: but the Word of our God ſhall ſtand forever,</hi> Iſai. 40. 6,--8. The ſacred Writings of the Old and New Teſtament agree in this, to ſhew vain Man his vile and periſhing Condition by the Fall, and the only Way to Glory and Immortality thro' a Redeemer. And the only wiſe God hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that this Word ſhould be preached unto us by Men like our ſelves, who are formed out of the Clay, and ſubject to the ſame natural and moral Infirmities; that the excellency of the Power may be of God, and that we may give Him the entire Glory of the wonderful Change wrought when Men are born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible, by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever. But the Time will not allow me to enlarge on this laſt Head. I therefore proceed to the APPLICATION.</p>

are the Things whereby Men ſeek a Name upon Earth? <hi>Job</hi> will tell us. <hi>Your Remembrances are like unto Aſhes,</hi> Job 13. 12. Yea, tho' ſinfulMan riſe ever ſo high in worldly Proſperity, yet is he vile and contemptible in the Eyes of that God who is the Fountain of all true Honour and Happineſs. <hi>Surely thou didſt ſet them in ſlippery Places; thou caſtedſt them down into Deſtruction. How are they brought into Deſolation, as in a Moment! they are utterly conſumed with Terrors. As a Dream when one awaketh; ſo, O Lord, when thou awakeſt thou ſhalt deſpiſe their Image,</hi> Pſal. 73.18,--20. Doth not their Excellency go away? Yes ſurely; and their Glory fadeth like a Leaf. Indeed, if Men attain to the Riches and Honours of this World, they are very prone to flatter themſelves as if they had gotten ſomething ſubſtantial and enduring; but what ſay the Oracles of God in oppoſition to theſe vain Thoughts? <hi>Their inward thought is, that their Houſes ſhall continue for ever, and their dwelling Places to all Generations; they call their Lands after their own Names. Nevertheleſs, Man being in Honour abideth not: he is like the Beaſts that periſh,</hi> Pſal. 49.11, 12. O then let us lie down in deep Abaſement before the Lord, and cry to him that we may be born again, born from above. We muſt be made Partakers of the divine Nature in the Image of God reſtor'd to us, or we ſhall live in vain, and die without Wiſdom.</p>

unto living Fountains of Water: and God ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes,</hi> Rev. 7. 17. And the Word of God declareth, that as <hi>Jeſus</hi> died, and roſe again, even ſo them which ſleep in <hi>Jeſus</hi> will God bring with him. They ſhall awake to Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Life in the Morning of the Reſurrection. Therefore you ſhould not Sorrow as others which have no Hope; but comfort your ſelves, and one another with theſe Words. See 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. In a Word, do your Souls cleave to the Duſt under diſtreſſing Troubles of a temporal or ſpiritual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? beſeech the Lord to quicken you according to his Word. Delight in God's Law, and you ſhall not periſh in your Afflictions; but thro' the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Comfort of the Scriptures, you ſhall have Hope. Thus you may rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, while you can have no Confidence in the Fleſh. And when your Fleſh and Heart ſhall fail, God will be the Strength of your Heart, and your Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Let us all, ſenſible of the frailty of this Life, be earneſt with God that we may be born again, not of corruptible Seed, but of incorruptible, by the Word of God; and then live as the believing Expectants of the Glory to be revealed.</p>
            <p>Go to the Father of Lights this Day, and ask that good and perfect Gift, a new Heart. Plead that promiſe, Ezek. 36 26, 7. <hi>A new Heart alſo will I give you, and a new Spirit will I put within you, and I will take away the Hony Heart out of your Fleſh, and I will give you an Heart of Fleſh. And I Will put my Spirit within you.</hi> And now, put off the old Man which is corrupt according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Luſts; and be renewed in the Spirit of your Minds; and put on the new Man which after God is created in Righteouſneſs &amp; true Holineſs. Eph. 4 22,--24 O let not the everlaſting State of your

memortal Souls hang in Suſpenſe upon the ſlender Thread of this frail Life? <hi>For what ſhall it profit a Man if he ſhall gain the whole World, &amp; loſe his own Soul? Or what ſhall a Man give in exchange for his Soul?</hi> Mar 8 36, 7 One Thing is needful; that you fit at Jeſus Feet, and hear his Word. O be not ſo careful and troubled about the Things of this vain Life, as to neglect this! But now chooſe that good Part which ſhall not be taken away from you, by taking God's Teſtimonies as an Heritage forever. Accept of Chriſt without delay, and ſubmit to him as your Prince and Saviour; for he hath the Keys of Hell and of Death. O be perſwaded to give Glory to that God in whoſe Hand your Breath is, before your Feet ſtumble upon the dark Mountains, and while you look for Light, He turn it into the Shadow of Death! Turn at God's Reproof, leſt you be ſuddenly deſtroyed. O that ſuch as are yet in their Sins, might remember the firſt Day of the Year by this good Token, their beginning to live to God! And may the Children of God have his Work reviv'd in their Souls! For theſe Ends, let us Pray, <hi>Lord, make me to know mine End, and the meaſure of my Days, what it is, that I may know how frail I am,</hi> Pſal. 39. 4. <hi>So teach us to number our Days, that we may apply our Hearts unto Wiſdom,</hi> Pſal. 90. 12. Men are very prone to put away the evil Day of Death, and ſo to neglect their Preparation for the eternal World. Let us then more cloſtly conſider the frailty and uncertainty of human Life, &amp; then apply it to ourſelves.</p>
            <p>It hath been conjectured that there are about three hundred and twenty Millions of People alive on the Earth at one Time; and computed from various Obſervation, that in Cities about One in Thirty die in a Year. <note n="*" place="bottom">Sir <hi>Willam P<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

It would be nothing ſtrange, if that Meſſage ſhould be brought to us, <hi>This Year thou ſhalt die.</hi> It is highly probable, according to the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courſe of God's Providence, that a Number of us ſhall be in our Graves before the next Year. And ſhall we not bring this Matter which ſo nearly concerns us all, each one of us, home to himſelf? It may be I am the Man; it may be you, and you, and you. We know not the Day of our Death. This Life may fitly be compar'd to a Lot. Our Days are determined with God; but altogether uncertain as to us. O let each one of us then ſay, It may be my Lot to die before the next Year. And ſhall I not make ready for my Lord's coming? Am I prepar'd to obey his Call by reſigning my Life to the Lord of it, and by committing my Soul into the ſaving Hands of Chriſt? And as our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Life may rather be reckon'd by Days than Years; let us ſay after our Saviour, <hi>I muſt work the Works of him that ſent me, while it is Day: the Night cometh when no Man can work,</hi> Joh. 9 4 And let us all be exhorted to work out our own Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear &amp; trembling; for there is no Work, nor Device, nor Knowlege in the Grave, whither we are going. I deſign'd to apply theſe Things in a more particular manner; but muſt only hint a few Things.</p>
            <p>Let <hi>Husbands &amp; Wives</hi> conſider that the Time is ſhort, and live as Heirs together of the Grace of Life, walking in all the Commandments and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Lord, blameleſs. O improve your intimate Acquaintance and dear Affection in help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each other on in the Way towards Heaven, where the Children of God live and converſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the holy Angels. Let <hi>Parents</hi> ſeek, firſt for themſelves, and then for their Children, that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004802_0024_100DF1D9919D3B48"/>
they may be born again. The Life which they derive from you the <hi>Fathers of their Fleſh,</hi> is very frail and defil'd with Sin; ſo that unleſs they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a better Life, it had been good for them, if they had not been born. O be not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd then to provide for their outward Man, that they may enjoy the Comforts of this Life; but rather travail in Birth again until Chriſt be formed In them, that they may be prepared for the Life of Heaven. Let the <hi>Aged</hi> give Diligence that while their outward Man decayeth, the inward Man may be renewed Day by Day Let our <hi>young People</hi> earneſtly ſeek the New Birth, that you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secrate the ſprightly Powers and growing Strength of Youth to the Lord of all your Time. O that you may be ſtrong to overcome the evil One, When he tempts you to delay your Converſion to God! Now, that we hope there are many of your Age preſſing into the Kingdom of God, O take heed leſt you be leſt under the Power of Darkneſs! <hi>Seek ye the Lord while he may be ſound, call ye upon him while he is near.</hi> Do not preſume of long Life. We read of the <hi>Sun's going down at Noon,</hi> Amos 8 9. Yea, the Shadows of Death have reach'd many before the Morning of Life was paſt, <hi>The young Men are dead,</hi> Job 1. 19. Make haſte to Chriſt then, leſt the Strength of Youth fail before you have laid hold on eternal Life. Let the <hi>great Men</hi> whoſe Wealth and outward Glory are increaſing, remember that Man being in Honour abideth not, his Glory ſhall not deſcend after him. O let not theſe periſhing Things then hinder you from ſeeking durable Riches and Righteouſneſs in Chriſt Jeſus! Let not the Riches or Cares or Pleaſures of this Life choke the Word, that it ſhould become unfruitful. For we are not redeemed from Sin and Death with corruptible Things, as Silver and Gold; but with the precious Blood of Chriſt.

Laſtly, Let Chriſt's <hi>Miniſters</hi> preach the Word, and the <hi>People</hi> hear it, under the impreſſive Belief of theſe important Truths. O conſider, you are as Graſs; but the Word of the Lord endureth for ever!</p>
            <p>To Conclude,</p>
            <p>This remarkable Year of <hi>forty one</hi> may put us in Mind of God's awful Judgments, particularly in the <hi>bloody Maſſacre</hi> in <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein about Two Hundred Thouſand Proteſtants were accounted as Sheep for the Slaughter by inhumane Butchers, under the Inſtigation of the <hi>Whore of Babylon,</hi> whom the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſaw in Viſion <hi>drunken with the Blood of the Saints, and with the Blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus,</hi> Rev. 17. 6. How were the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as Graſs in that terrible Day of the Lord! <note n="‡" place="bottom">This horrible Rebellion began October 23.1641. See <hi>Whitlooke's</hi> Memoirs, and Sir <hi>John Temple's</hi> Hiſtory of the Iriſh Rebellion. The Rev. Dr. <hi>Daniel Williams,</hi> who liv'd many Years in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> hath theſe Words, "Two Hundred Thouſand Proteſtants were deſtroy'd by theſe bloody Men. Many, at the firſt breaking out of this Rebellion, were invited to Feaſts by the <hi>Iriſh,</hi> and butcher'd at the Entertainment: Mere dying was a Kindneſs; tediouſneſs and barbarity muſt heighten their Slaughters; they ſtrip'd Multitudes, and forced them to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by Cold and Famine in that hard Winter Crowds were burnt together in Barns; many driven into Rivers, and ſuch as attempted to eſcape, were forced back to periſh in the Waters. Women with Child they rip'd open; poor Babes they toſſed on Pikes, as pleaſing Sport. Candles were made of Man's Greaſe; no Intreaties of Women or Children could induce to Pity. —Thankſgiving Sermon preach'd <hi>October</hi> 22. 1689. for the Proteſtants Deliverance from the <hi>Iriſh Rebellion.</hi>

Let us make ſure of the Bleſſing's of Chriſt's Kingdom, Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt; that we may be carried well thro' all the Troubles of this Life, and be prepat'd for that Inheritance which is incorruptible, and that fadeth not away.</p>
