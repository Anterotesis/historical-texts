            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In the Year 1681, the province of Pennſylvania being granted to William Penn, he removed thither with a conſiderable number of his friends, moſtly of the people called Quakers. It is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſpecial notice, that moſt of the ſettlements in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica were made with little regard to any prior title in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; but William Penn did not think his permiſſion to colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize the tract of land granted to him by king Charles II. a ſufficient title to the country; but aſſembled the Sachems or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and obtained their conſent to ſettle upon the extent of land that he wanted.

The Quakers hold that this law of truth, this teſt of virtue and vice is not hid from any part of mankind; but that every man born into the world, is enlightened by it; the ſerious and well diſpoſed Heathens, in different ages and nations, have, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der various appellations, expreſſed their ſenſibility of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence and efficacy of this Divine Principle, this law of God written in the heart, to deliver from that corruption under which they laboured. Socrates, Plato, Seneca, Epictetus, and ſeveral others of the philoſophers called their diſciples to an attention to its dictates.

            <p>THE temporal miſeries and wrongs which are the ſad ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of war, are neither to be numbered nor expreſſed.—What theivery bears any proportion to that which with the boldneſs of drum and trumpet, plunders the innocent of all they have? and if themſelves are left alive, with all their limbs, or their daughters unraviſhed, they have many times only the aſhes of their conſumed houſes to lye down upon.—What honour has war gotten, from its thouſands and tens of hundreds of thouſands of men ſlaughtered on heaps, with as little regret or concern as at loads of rubbiſh thrown into a pit—Who but the fiery dragon, would put a wreath, of laurel on ſuch heroes heads. Who but he, could ſay unto them. <hi>Well done, good and faithful ſervants.</hi> But there is ſtill an evil of war much greater, though leſs regarded, apparent to thoſe who reflect, how many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of thouſands of men, born into this world, for no other end but that they may, by being born again of Chriſt, from ſons of Adam's miſery, <hi>became ſons of God, and fellow-heirs with Chriſt,</hi> in everlaſting glory; who reflects, I ſay, what name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs numbers of theſe are robbed of God's precious gift of life to them, before they have known the one ſole benefit of living, who are not ſuffered to ſtay in this world, till age and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have helped them to know the inward voice and operation of God's ſpirit, have helped them to find and feel that evil, curſe, and ſting of ſin and death, which muſt be taken from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them, before they can <hi>die the death of the righteous;</hi> who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of this, have been either violently forced or tempted in the fire of youth, and full ſtrength of ſinful luſts, to forget God, eternity, and their own ſouls, and ruſh into kill or be killed, with as much furious haſte and goodneſs of ſpirit, as tyger kills tyger for the ſake of his prey. Amongſt unfallen creatures in heaven, God's name and nature is love, light and glory—to the fallen ſons of Adam, that which was love, light, and glory

in heaven, becomes infinite pity and compaſſion on earth, in a God, cloathed with the nature of his fallen creature, bearing all its infirmities, entering into all its troubles, and in the meek innocence of a lamb of God; living a life and dying a death of all ſufferings due to ſin, Sing! O ye heavens! and ſhout all ye lower parts of the earth, for this is our God, that varies not, whoſe firſt creating love knows no change, but into a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming pity towards all his fallen creatures. Look now at warring Chriſtendom, what ſmalleſt drop of pity towards ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners is to be found in it? or how could a ſpirit, all helliſh, more fully contrive and haſten their deſtruction; it ſtirs up and kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles every paſſion of fallen nature, that is contrary to all hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, all-meek, all-loving, all-forgiving, all-ſaving ſpirit of Chriſt—it unites, it drives, and compells nameleſs numbers of unconverted ſinners to fall murdering and murdered, amongſt flaſhes of fire, with the wrath and ſwiftneſs of lightning, into a fire infinitely worſe than that in which they died—O ſad ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject for thankſgiving days, whether in popiſh or proteſtant churches; for if there is a <hi>joy of all the angels in heaven for one ſinner that repenteth,</hi> what a joy muſt there be in hell, over ſuch multitudes of ſinners, not ſuffered to repent?

will one ſingle chriſtian church, people, or language, tremble as the ſhare they have in this death of ſinners—Again, would you further ſee the fall of the univerſal church, from being led by the Spirit of Chriſt, to be guided by the inſpiration of the great fiery dragon, look at all European Chriſtendom failing round the globe, with fire and ſword, and every murdering art of war, to ſeize the poſſeſſions and ſteal or kill the inhabitants of the Africa and the Indies—What natural right of man, what ſupernatural virtue, which Chriſt bro't down from heaven, is not here trodden under foot?—all that you ever read or heared of heathen barbarity, was here outdone by chriſtian conquerors. What wars of chriſtians againſt chriſtians, blended with ſcalping heathens, have ſtained the earth and the ſeas with human blood, for a miſerable ſhare in the ſpoils of a plundered heathen world; a world which ſhould have heard, or ſeen, or felt nothing from the followers of Chriſt, but a divine love that had forced them from diſtant lands, and through the perils of long ſeas, to viſit ſtrangers, with thoſe glad tidings of <hi>peace and ſalvation,</hi> to all the world, which angels from heaven, and ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds on earth, proclaimed at the birth of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>But to know whether chriſtianity admits of war, chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is to be conſidered as in its right ſtate; now the true ſtate of the world, turned chriſtian, is thus deſcribed by the great Goſpel-prophet, who ſhewed what a change it was to make in the fallen ſtate of the world; <hi>It ſhall come to paſs, in the laſt days, that the mountain of the Lord's houſe ſhall be eſtabliſhed in the top of the mountains, and all nations ſhall flow into it, and many people ſhall ſay, Let us go up to the mountain of the Lord's houſe, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths,</hi> Iſa. ii. 2. Now what follows from this going up of the nations to the mountain of the Lord's houſe, the holy prophet expreſsly tells you in the following words: <hi>They ſhall beat their ſwords into plow-ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning-hooks: nation ſhall not lift up its ſword againſt nation, ☞ neither ſhall they learn war any more, Iſa.</hi> ii. 4. <hi>Mic.</hi> iv. 3.

upon it, as when the Lamb of God ſaid, <hi>By this ſhall all men know, that ye are my diſciples, if ye love one another, as I have loved you, John</hi> xiii. 34.

Would you farther ſee when and where the kingdoms of this fallen world are become a kingdom of God, the Goſpel prophet tells you, that it is then and there where all enmity ceaſeth. <hi>The wolf,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard ſhall lye down with the kid: the calf and the young lion, and the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Hence we are enjoined, by our bleſſed Saviour, to pray for, and continually to watch over every ſuggeſtion of our corrupt minds, which may impede the accompliſhment of theſe gracious promiſes: <hi>Thy kingdom come, thy will be done in earth, as is done in heaven.</hi> The frequent accounts we meet with in the Old Teſtament, of wars being carried on in the time of the law, gives no ſanction to the ſame practice under the goſpel; as this laſt diſpenſation is a wonderous diſplay of divine benignity and love, pronouncing thoſe only bleſſed, who are found in the actual poſſeſſion of that poverty of ſpirit, that meekneſs and

            <p>We are Chriſtians, not Jews, and are therefore required to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to the inſtruction and practice of our great and good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampler, Jeſus Chriſt, who was declared from heaven to be <hi>the beloved Son of God;</hi> and whoſe appearance on earth was uſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in by the angels and heavenly hoſt, with a publication of <hi>peace on earth, and good will towards men.</hi> The prophecies which preceded our Saviour's coming, clearly pointed to the greater excellency of the diſpenſation, which was to take place when He, <hi>the peaceable Shiloh, the deſire of nations ſhould come,</hi> unto whom the gathering of the people was to be, <hi>Hag.</hi> ii. 7.</p>

            <p>The efficacy of this ſuffering ſpirit of Chriſt was contrary to the natural will, and a myſtery to the reaſoning part in man; <q>it was to the Jews a ſtumbling-block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs,</q> and ſtill remains a myſtery to the <q>wiſdom of the world,</q> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.22.</p>

            <p>Hence we have reaſon to believe, that the injunction and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance granted to the Jews, of making war upon their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and one upon another; was in conſequence of that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, which prevailed amongſt them; and that this permiſſion was granted from the ſame motive, as that mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by our Lord, when the Jews were pleading the licence given them by Moſes, to put away their wives and marry other women, <hi>Mark</hi> x. 5 <q>For the hardneſs of your hearts, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes wrote you this precept; but from the beginning of the creation God made them male and female—what therefore God hath joined together, let no man put aſunder.</q> This, as well as war, ſlavery, and other practices of the like nature, were a violence upon that union, purity and brotherly love, which ſubſiſted in the beginning, in the original conſtitution of things, whilſt man retained his primative innocency. And that the ſpilling of human blood was not acceptable in the eyes of perfect Purity, who the apoſtle denominates under the appellation of love, <hi>God is Love,</hi> appears from the prohibition laid upon king David, not to build an houſe unto God, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his having been concerned in the deſtruction of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his fellow creatures, as himſelf declared, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxii. 8. <q>The word of the Lord came to me, ſaying, Thou haſt ſhed blood abundantly, and haſt made great wars; thou ſhalt not build an houſe unto my name, becauſe thou haſt ſhed much blood upon the earth in my fight.</q>

            <head type="sub">WHAT IS A TRUE CHRISTIAN?</head>
            <p>IS it one who aſſerts to and believes certain facts, as recorded in holy writ, and forms certain principles and opinions thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; producing perhaps a partial reformation, an abſtaining from the groſſer pollutions of ſin, but denying the poſſibility of a total cleanſing and freedom from ſin in this world? Or is it one who knows not in word only, but in deed and in truth, a death unto ſin, and a new birth unto righteouſneſs; a being born again, not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of man, but of God? For, ſays our bleſſed Lord, "except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." A man may know with Nicodemus, and confeſs, that Chriſt is a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſent from God, he may be able to talk much about the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of the goſpel, and fancy himſelf ſecure by imputation, but what has this to do with the new birth ſo eſſentially neceſſary? What can all his wiſdom and underſtanding teach him. Nay, he cannot come into the new birth till all is parted with. The very nature of the thing implies a beginning again, a life as dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, from his former as light from darkneſs. <q>Ye were ſometime darkneſs,</q> ſays Paul, "but now are ye light in the Lord." Now he who knows this new birth, not a change

of opinion, not a comprehending the truths of the goſpel in his underſtanding, or joining this or that ſociety, but who knows the thing itſelf; not the name, not the imaginations concerning it, but the nature, the life, the eſſence, will ſuch a man be like what he was before.</p>
            <p>The forerunner of our Lord expreſsly told his hearers; when preparing them for the goſpel diſpenſation, <q>The axe is laid to the root of the trees, and every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and caſt into the fire.</q> What tree and what root is there meant? Is it outward or inward? Who can anſwer that, but he who hath felt the axe, and the deſtruction in a meaſure of the corrupt tree? <q>His fan is in his hand, he adds, and he will thoroughly purge his floor;</q> (mark "thoroughly,") what will remain then? that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors were concerned to know, and willing to part, with all that ſtands in the way, that they may know indeed what it is to be thoroughly purged, inſtead of denying the poſſibility of it; for it is a dreadful thing to oppoſe or deny the power of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Chriſt ſaid, "Bleſſed are the pure in heart," but modern Chriſtians, as they would be thought, ſay, There is no purity of heart, but it is and muſt remain deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked? Again it is ſaid, <q>who brings a clean thing out of an unclean?</q> That the heart is naturally unclean as allowed, but hath not the Lord promiſed to cleanſe his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple from all their uncleanneſſes; mark all, what uncleanneſs will then remain? Some attempt to excuſe themſelves by what Paul once experienced; <q>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit, and the ſpirit againſt the fleſh; a law in the members warring againſt the law of the mind.</q> That Paul once felt that, is allowed, but did he not after ſay, <q>There is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit,</q> and did he not ſay, "The law of the ſpirit of life had made him free from the law
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035518_0049_10055B9BEE6C4ED0"/>
of ſin; and how could they who were dead unto ſin live any longer therein?" Doth he not again ſay, <q>I am dead with Chriſt, nevertheleſs I live, yet not I, (not natural ſinful ſelf,) but Chriſt liveth in me?" "I will dwell in them, and walk in them, ſaith the Lord;</q> and will the Lord dwell in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy place? As ſoon would light dwell with darkneſs. Satan can indeed tranſform himſelf into an angel of light, yea, he, as God, ſitteth in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God. The imagining part in man is ſure to be deceived, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the appearance inſtead of the reality, for the worldby wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, man by his natural or humanly acquired abilities, knew not, nor ever can know God. "If any man, ſays Paul, will be wiſe, let him firſt become a fool," that his old eye may be cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the new eye which alone can diſcern the things of God, may be opened.</p>
            <p>Again, Chriſt ſaith, <q>Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</q> But modern Chriſtians, as they call themſelves, ſay there is no ſuch thing as perfection. O that they would conſider whom they oppoſe by ſo ſaying.</p>

            <p>Again, Chriſt ſaith, "Swear not at all;" but modern Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſay, We may ſwear in ſome caſes.

I became ſenſible, that the tree muſt firſt be made good, before the fruit could be good; a doctrine eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally different from what I had heard of men, even of men highly eſteemed; by whom I was taught, that deliverance from ſin is not to be expected in this life; and was hearing, day after day, the uniform acknowledgement of 'being miſerable ſinners, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no health,' &amp;c. which I found by the manifeſtations of that ſpirit which "is given to every man to profit withal," 1 Cor. xii. 7, and which diſcovers the ſecret things of darkneſs, to be not agreeable, but contrary, to the ſcriptures of truth; which expreſsly declare, that the great Author of the goſpel diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation "came to ſave his people <hi>from</hi> their ſins," Matt. 1.21, and <hi>not in them:</hi> a very eſſential difference. This I believe muſt be experimentally known, feeling ſin to be the great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the ſoul, the alone cauſe of ſeparation from the moſt High, in whom alone true happineſs is found. I was ſenſible that while ſin remained, the ſeparation muſt continue, there being "no communion between light and darkneſs, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and unrighteouſneſs; 2. Cor. vi. 14, nor could that gracious promiſe be fulfilled, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them, I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people;" 2 Cor vi. 16, for the apoſtle ſays, "ye are the temple of God, and the temple of God is holy." 1 Cor. iii. 17.</p>
            <p>Further, John the Baptiſt who was ſent to prepare the way of the Lord, deſcribing the nature and effects of his maſter's kingdom, ſays "Now (mark now) is the axe laid to the root of the tree; every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and caſt into the fire." Mat. iii 10. This is a language ſurely implying a complete, effectual cleanſing from all the pollutions of ſin, even now in this life. Our Lord himſelf uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly, in all his diſcourſes, inculcated this doctrine. In that
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035518_0052_10055B7930EEF658"/>
moſt excellent ſermon on the Mount, Matt. v. 6.7, he inſiſts on the neceſſity of a righteouſneſs ſuperior to that of the law; for ſays he, "except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Scribes and Phariſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

               </gap> no caſe enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the kingdom of heaven." What language can be plainer? And that he did not mean an imaginary, merely imputed right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eousneſs, as I fear, many vainly ſuppoſe, is evident from the concluſion; where he draws the compariſon between thoſe who hear, and do his ſayings, and them who hear and do them not; thereby fully eſtabliſhing the poſſibility of doing them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And if due attention is paid to every part of that diſcourſe, I think it muſt be obvious, that they who are of the happy number, who not only hear, but do thoſe ſayings; and who our Lord li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens to a building upon a rock, on which they are able to withſtand all oppoſition; will not be miſerable ſinners, doing what they ought not to do, having no health in them; &amp;c. but will know a righteouſneſs wrought in them far ſuperior to that of the law. For, as the law, the outward law, written on ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of ſtone, took cognizance of outward actions; the law of Chriſt, written, as the apoſtle ſays, in the fleſhly tables of the heart, reaches to the root, and ſource of action; for, whereas the law ſaid, "Thou ſhalt not kill," Chriſt forbids being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry without cauſe. Again, the law ſaid, "Thou ſhalt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit adultery;" Chriſt forbids luſt, thus ſtriking at the root. The cauſe being removed, the conſequence or effect muſt una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably be done away. Once more, the law ſaid, "Thou ſhalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy; an eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth." Chriſt ſays, "Reſiſt not evil, love your enemies, do good to them that hate you;" with much more of like import, which many who profeſs to follow him, ſeem to pay very little attention to; as though it was an indifferent matter, whether they do them or not. But it may be well for ſuch to conſider whether our Lord would have ſaid, "Be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect," if he did not mean that they ſhould be ſo; and whether they who do as he there exhorts, will not be perfect. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035518_0053_10055B7D80F84698"/>
conceive how it is poſſible to deduce any other inference without groſsly wreſting the ſcripture "Ye are my friends," ſaid he at another time, <q>if ye do whatſoever I have command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you.</q> John xv. 14. <q>He that loveth me keepeth my commandments,</q> John xiv. 21. "Not every one that ſaith unto me Lord, Lord, (that call me maſter and honour me with their lips,) ſhall enter into the kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father, which is in heaven." Matt. vii. 21. "If ye know theſe things happy are ye if ye do them," John xiii. 17. For if the ſimple belief of Chriſt's ſufferings, reſurrection, &amp;c. be ſufficient to ſave; to what purpoſe was all his diſcourſes, wherein he repeatedly inſiſts upon the neceſſity of regeneration, a being born again; which certainly implies ſomething more than a change of opinion, a perſuaſion of the judgment, and a partial reformation? For as he ſaid to Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, "That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh, and that which is born of the ſpirit, is ſpirit," John iii. 6. it obviouſly follows, that they who are really born of the spirit, will be of the ſame nature as the ſpirit. "Old things will be paſſed away, and all things become new, and all of God," 2 Cor. v. 17. "A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump," Luke xiii. 21. "New wine muſt be put into new bottles." Mark ii. 22; with many other ſimilitudes, plainly implying the neceſſity of a total effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual change. Again to confirm this great and neceſſary truth of freedom from ſin, he ſays to his diſciples, "if ye continue in my word, then are ye my diſciples indeed, and ye ſhall know the truth, and the truth ſhall make you free," and, to reprove their carnal ideas of a temporal outward freedom, he adds, "He that committeth ſin, is the ſervant of ſin," and "If the Son ſhall make you free, ye ſhall be free indeed," John viii 31. &amp;c. That this freedom from ſin, even from the power, as well as the guilt, is to be known in this life, is certified again, by his ſaying of thoſe who die in their ſins, "Whither I go, ye cannot come," John viii. 21. Now if deliverance from ſin is not known in this life, we muſt of neceſſity die in our ſins. Therefore it matters not what knowledge a man hath, what is
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035518_0054_10055B86920DBC10"/>
his faith, or what profeſſion he hath made, if he hath not known deliverance from ſin. This is a point ſo important, and a miſtake therein liable to ſuch baneful conſequences, that I am induced to dwell upon it: knowing from my own experience, how pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing is the contrary opinion. Nor is it ſtrange, that people ſhould prefer and indulge the notion of the poſſibility of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from the guilt and puniſhment of ſin, without the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er thereof being ſubdued. We naturally love eaſe, an eaſe which the croſs of Chriſt is decidedly againſt. So cloſe does it apply, that it is, in our Lord's own words, as cutting off a right hand, and plucking out a right eye. Matt. vi. 29.30. "Who ſoever," ſays he, again and again, "doth not bear his croſs, and come after me, cannot be my diſciple," Luke xiv. 27. The apoſtle bears teſtimony to this important truth, where he ſays "They that are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh with its affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and luſts." Gal. v. xxiv. Surely if luſts and affections, the very root and ſeed of ſin, are ſlain, what can remain there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of? In another place he ſays, "How ſhall we that are dead to ſin live any longer therein?" Rom. vi. 2. Another apoſtle ſays, Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him, and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God." 1 John iii. 9.</p>
            <p>I have produced a few plain paſſages of ſcripture, to ſhew the ground or cauſe of my ſeparation; that deliverance from ſin, a being cleanſed from all defilement thereof in this life, is not only poſſible, but indiſpenſibly neceſſary; and that the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry doctrine is fundamentally erroneous; as it ſets up the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow inſtead of the ſubſtance, an imaginary, inſtead of a real holineſs. I may probably make ſome more obſervations on this moſt important point, as I proceed. I ſhall now offer a few remarks on ſome of the ſervices uſually performed; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them alſo with the ſcriptures of truth, which moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors acknowledge to be the ſtandard or rule; from which compariſon they clearly appear to me, not to be what many call them, means of grace and ordinances of God; but the mere inventions of man, ſet up in his own fallen wiſdom, as a ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:035518_0055_10055B8BF3272F30"/>
for the life and power, which were loſt in a long dark night of apoſtacy: not the true worſhip of God, but ſuch bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe as the apoſtle ſays, "profiteth little, 1 Tim. iv. 8. For be it remembered, the great Author of the goſpel diſpenſation expreſsly declared, "that the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth," John iv. 23. And the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle confirms it, by ſaying, "We know not what we ſhould pray for, as we ought; but the ſpirit helpeth our infirmities and maketh interceſſion for us with groanings which cannot be uttered, Rom. vii. 26. Therefore, as this neceſſary aſſiſtance is not at our command, for people to pretend to worſhip the Moſt High in a preſcribed form, or in the ſtudied or extempore pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of their own natural or acquired abilities, in their own wills, and their own time, without waiting to feel the influences and movings of the Holy Spirit, in and through which alone true worſhip can be performed, appears to me to be nothing better, whatever it may be called, than <hi>will-worſhip.</hi> The ſcriptures alſo repeatedly mention a growing in grace, 2 Pet. iii. 18, a going on unto perfection, Heb. vi. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> How inconſiſtent then is the repeated uniform acknowledgment, "We are miſerable ſinners, doing what we ought not to do, having no health in us," &amp;c? Doth it not obviouſly confeſs, if the truth is ſpoken, that no benefit hath been received, notwithſtanding the frequent (as it is pretended) waiting upon the Lord? But if it is true, as the ſcriptures declare, that Chriſt came to 'ſave his people from their ſins;' they who make that confeſſion, acknowledge they are not of that number; for if they are miſerable ſinners, they certainly are not ſaved from their ſins, however they may attempt to reconcile ſo plain a contradiction. This is a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage not confined to a particular part of the ſervice; the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency of the whole appears equally obvious; as at one time confeſſing their ſins and wickedneſſes; then called upon to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the moſt High, with pure, humble, penitent, and obedient hearts; one while returning thanks for creation, preſervation and redemption; again acknowledging having erred and ſtrayed like loſt ſheep; deſiring to ſhew forth his praiſe not only with
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:035518_0056_10055BA35FFFD178"/>
their lips, but in their lives, by giving themſelves up to his ſervice, and walking before him in holineſs and righteouſneſs all their days; but ſtill miſerable ſinners, doing what they ought not to do, &amp;c. Can this running backwards and forwards, one time ſaying one thing, another time quite the contrary, be acceptable ſervice to that God, who ſearcheth the heart, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ins, and requireth truth in the inward parts? Again, in repeating the experiences of the royal Pſalmiſt, how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but many groſs falſehoods muſt be expreſſed? For if the words of the mouth do not expreſs the real experimental lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the heart, however excellent they may be yet they are to thoſe who utter them, not the language of truth but of falſehood. I ſhould hope a little ſerious conſideration will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of this.</p>
            <p>Again, reſpecting the cuſtom or practice of ſinging, I have a few obſervations to make. How inconſiſtent is it, that they who have juſt before been confeſſing their miſery and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, ſhould appear ſo quickly and eaſily to forget all, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin ſinging. Surely it ſeems evidently to declare, they were not ſincere in their acknowledgments, or that they think it of very little conſequence whether their prayers are anſwered or not. Beſides, not only the manner to me appears abſurd and inconſiſtent: but the matter in many quite contrary to truth, and to what has been juſt before openly avowed. I could ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cify many inſtances in every collection I have ſeen, but I wiſh people to ſearch for themſelves. Surely this is trifling with ſerious things. I am fully perſuaded that the common practice of ſinging is only calculated to amuſe the creature, to pleaſe the outward ear; whatever may be pretended of its warming the heart and kindling devotion. And if thoſe who practiſe it would be honeſt and candid, I am of opinion they would be conſtrained to acknowledge that <hi>amuſement</hi> is the chief object; or why ſo pleaſed with tunes and muſic? Can it for a moment be ſuppoſed, that the Almighty is to be pleaſed with ſuch ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:035518_0057_10055BA5165170A0"/>
conduct? Surely not, And with reſpect to its kindling devotion, it may be well to remember what is ſaid of thoſe, "who kindle a fire, and encompaſs themſelves about with ſparks; they may walk in the light thereof, but they ſhall lie down in ſorrow," Iſa. l. 11. I readily admit what is advanced to defend this cuſtom, that our Lord and his diſciples, the night before he ſuffered, ſang a hymn, but what or how we are not informed; no doubt the matter and manner were both proper and ſeaſonable; and that Paul and Silas, in priſon, "ſang praiſes to the Lord," I believe; but I cannot conceive what argument can be deduced from thence for the preſent cuſtom of ſinging whatever may be given out, ſuitable or not, whether praiſe, profeſſion, acknowledgment or petition. I fully believe this outward inconſiderate ſinging is very different from that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the apoſtle, "Singing with the ſpirit, and with the underſtanding, 1 Cor. xiv. 15. "Singing and making melody in your hearts to the Lord," Eph. v. 19. And I alſo believe, that the true ſource of praiſe, even a greatful ſenſe of the Lord's mercies, can be more conſiſtently expreſſed than in outward jingle and ſound.</p>
            <p>Indeed, my friends, I fear you are, many of you, agreeably to your own confeſſion, in a miſerable condition. Suffer me to prevail upon you to conſider, whether your continuing year after year miſerable ſinners, is not the conſequence of your prayers not being heard; and let a concern ariſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether you have been ſeeking aright or not: for our Lord promiſed plainly and expreſsly, "that they who ſeek ſhall find," Matt. vii. 5. Now, what have they found, who continue as they acknowledge, 'miſerable ſinners having no health in them &amp;c? Do they not rather confeſs that the means they have uſed are inſufficient to cleanſe and heal them; that they have not rightly applied to the great phyſician, to the balm of Gilead, "to that tree, whoſe leaves are for the healing of the nations; but have been ſpending their money for that which is not bread, and their Labour for that which ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth not; inſtead of hearkening diligently unto the Lord, and eating that which is good;" Iſa. lv. 2. that true bread of life,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:035518_0058_10055BA7F62BEB80"/>
which our Lord ſaid, "whoſoever eat thereof ſhould live fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver?" John vi. 58. It may be well to have recourſe to theſe means before the poſſibility of cure is denied; leſt they thereby deny the power of God, that he is not able to "caſt out the ſtrong man armed, who keepeth his palace and his goods in peace," Luke xi 21. I think I need not add, who is there meant by the ſtrong man armed, where is his palace, and what are his goods. The apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome, "who had a form of godlineſs but denied the power thereof." 2 Tim. iii. 5. Now, it may be well to conſider, in what can the power of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be known, but in dominion over its adverſary, which is ſin. And do not they who deny the poſſibility of ſins being ſubdued, deny the power of godlineſs? A ſerious conſideration may not be unprofitable. I have often admired, that thoſe who plead for ſin pretend highly to value the ſcriptures, and ſay, 'the ſcriptures is the rule;' whereas the ſcriptures uniformly inſiſt upon the neceſſity of holineſs; not an imaginary holineſs, but a real purity of heart and of life. "Without holineſs," ſaid the apoſtle, "no man ſhall ſee the Lord." Heb. xii. 14. "Be ye holy in all manner of converſation, becauſe it is written, Be ye holy for I am holy," 1. Pet. i. 15. "Preſent your bodies, (mark, your bodies) a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice," Rom. xii. 1. They talk much of the blood of Chriſt; it is a ſubject often in the mouth, but what of the nature and effects of it is known, let their own acknowledgments teſtify. The apoſtle declares it cleanſeth from all ſin," 1 John i. vii. Now how thoſe who continue 'miſerable ſinners, doing what they ought not to do,' &amp;c can be cleanſed from all ſin, let the conſiderate judge.</p>
            <p>It is with me now, to anſwer ſome objections to this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truth; and to remark on ſome paſſages of ſcripture, which thoſe who deny the poſſibility of ſin being ſubdued, endeavour to cover themſelves with. Firſt, that 'The heart of man is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked, who can
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:035518_0059_10055BAA4787FE68"/>
know it?' Jer. xvii. 9. That the heart of every man, of every natural unregenerate man, is truely ſo, I firmly believe: but be it remembered that the Lord promiſed to give his people a new heart and a new ſpirit: Ezek. xxxvi. 26. And dare any one ſay, that heart is deceitful and wicked? O, beware of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciating the gift of God. "Bleſſed are the pure in heart' ſaith our Lord, for they ſhall ſee God." Matt. v. 8. "A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit." Mark vii. 18. "The ſeed on the good ground are they who in an honeſt and good heart, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence." Luke viii. 15. For now, in the goſpel diſpenſation, the axe is laid to the root of the tree, Matt. iii. 10. What is the root of the tree there alluded to but the heart, from whence words and actions have their birth? "Thou blind Phariſee," ſaid Chriſt, "cleanſe firſt that which is within the cup and the platter, that the outſide may be clean alſo" Matt. xxiii. 26. And do they not in the ſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed form, pray that God, 'would cleanſe the thoughts of their hearts, by the inſpiration of his holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit" a moſt excellent petition; but what is it in thoſe who uſe it and yet deny the poſſibility of its being anſwered, but a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn mockery? For if the thoughts of the heart are really cleanſed, there can be no ſin, for ſin defiles and pollutes the heart.</p>
            <p>Another objection, is the language of the apoſtle, where he ſpeaks of 'a law in his members warring againſt the law of his mind, and bringing him into captivity to the law of ſin, and that in his fleſh dwelt no good thing, Rom. vii. That the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle once was in that ſtate, I think, is beyond a doubt; and that every real Chriſtian experiences a ſimilar, till the ſtrong man armed is caſt out, and the old leaven purged away. But that he was ſo at the time of waiting it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o me appears by no means credible, from what he has written juſt before and after; or he muſt groſsly contradict himſelf, which will hardly be allowed? but rather that he was deſcribing the effects of the law upon the carnal unregenerate mind: for he ſays, "The
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:035518_0060_10055BAC8EA7ADB0"/>
law is ſpiritual, but I am carnal, ſold under ſin." Now can it be ſuppoſed that the apoſtle was then carnal? &amp;c. Surely not, For juſt after, he ſays. 'the carnal mind is enmity againſt God, and 'to be carnal minded is death.' chap. viii. 6.7. and that "they who are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God;" but he adds, "Ye are not in the fleſh, but in the ſpirit, if the ſpirit of God dwell in you; and if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his." It conſequently follows, that if the apoſtle was then in a carnal ſtate, he was none of Chriſt's, but at enmity againſt God. A little before, he ſays, "Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of ſin might be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that henceforth we ſhould not ſerve ſin: for he that is dead is freed from ſin, " chap. vi. 6.7. And in the 2nd verſe, "How ſhall we that are dead to ſin, live any longer therein." And in the 22nd verſe, "Being made free from ſin, and become ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to God, ye have your fruit unto holineſs, and the end e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting life."</p>
            <p>Now let this plain language, both before and after, written no boubt at the ſame time, determine whether the apoſtle was then in a carnal unregenerate ſtate or not. And though he elſewhere ſays, "Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect;" Phil. iii. 10. I think it in no reſpect fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours the conſtruction many put upon it, that the apoſtle was then in a ſinful ſtate, but rather makes againſt them, as it plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemns the notion, of being perfectly and for ever juſtifiable by mere imputation, and evinces the danger of ſitting down at eaſe, reſting ſatisfied with an imaginary juſtification. For in another place, ſpeaking of the Chriſtian progreſs, he ſays, though he did not run as uncertainly, or fight as one that beateth the air, yet he found it neceſſary to keep under his body and bring it into ſubjection, or there was a danger, notwithſtanding he had preached to others, of his being ſtill a caſt away, 1 Cor. ix. 26, 27. Another objection is, the ſame apoſtle ſays, "By grace ye are ſaved, through faith, and that not of yourſelves? it is the gift of God, not of works, leſt any man ſhould boaſt." Eph. ii. 8, 9. In anſwer to which, I believe it is very neceſſary to
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035518_0061_10055BAE201D7750"/>
diſtinguiſh between the works of man, which he does in his own will and ſtrength, and thoſe works which are wrought of God. Perhaps it is not rightly knowing this diſtinction that people cry out againſt works us though they were all a ſelf-righteouſneſs. The works of man, of the unrenewed carnal mind, yea the beſt of them, are as filthy rags; but I think there ſhould be a great care not to join the works of God (thoſe which he worketh in his people) with man's own works; for in the next verſe the apoſtle ſays, "Ye are his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works, which God hath before ordained, that we ſhould walk in them." That it is by grace, I believe, no real Chriſtian will deny, but will, with humble gratitude in all his progreſs, acknowledge with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, "by the grace of God I am what I am," 1 Cor. xv, 10. This grace the ſame apoſtle declared, hath appeared to all men, (mark that, not to any particular part) and teaches, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly, in this preſent world. He does not ſay (it teaches) we muſt continue in ſin, "What," ſays he in another place, "ſhall we continue in ſin, that grace may abound, God forbid," Rom. vi. 1. That it is alſo through faith, who will deny? for "without faith it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to pleaſe God," Heb. xi, 6. But the apoſtle ſpeaks of a dead faith, James ii. 17. of a faith the devils have, verſe 19. The true faith, he ſays, worketh by love, Gal. v. 6. purifieth the heart, Acts xv. 9. and overcometh the world, 1 John v. 4. Now what faith have thoſe, who ſay, they are 'tied and bound with the chain of their ſins, that they are miſerable ſinners, having no health in them" &amp;c. The tree is known by its fruit.</p>
            <p>Again, the words of our Lord, when upon the earth in the days of his fleſh, to thoſe whom he had healed of their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, are pleaded in excuſe for continuing in ſin, as "Thy faith hath ſaved thee, thy faith hath made thee whole, &amp;c. But be it remembered, that thoſe to whom he ſaid ſo were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely cured, received 'perfect ſoundneſs;' and, I believe,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035518_0062_10055BAFAC488858"/>
there is a remnant at this day, who witneſs the ſame works, ſpiritually accompliſhed by the powerful operation of the ſame word in the heart, even a being made whole, a being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> of the great diſeaſe of ſin, prefigured by the various cures performed on the bodies of the people.</p>
            <p>Once more, another argument adduced is where the apoſtle ſays, "If we ſay we have no ſin we deceive ourſelves and the truth is not in us," 1 John i. 8. But a due attention to what follows, I think will clearly explain, that the apoſtle does not favour the idea that he was then in that ſtate; for he adds, 'if we ſay we have ſinned,' plainly alluding to time paſt, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, "if we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs;" and as all unrighteouſneſs is ſin, chap. v. 16. they who are cleanſed from all, ſurely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> have none remaining. It is the ſincere de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of my mind, that the people would conſider for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and not take things of ſuch importance upon truſt, but attend to the advice of the apoſtle, "Let every man prove his own work, then ſhall he have rejoicing in himſelf, and not in another, for every man ſhall bare his own burden." Gal. vi. 4, 5. "Be not deceived," he adds juſt after, "God is not mocked; whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he reap," what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever be his opinion, knowledge or faith. And in another place he ſays, though he had all knowledge, could underſtand all myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, though he had all faith, even to remove mountains, yet he might be as nothing, 1 Cor. xiii. 2. Therefore it might be well to have a care of talking ſo highly of the ſcriptures, while the life and converſation is not agreeable thereto; and remember the words of our Lord to ſome of old, "Search the ſcriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life; and they are they which teſtify of me, and ye will not come unto me that ye might have life," John v. 39.40. From which it appears, and is worthy the moſt ſerious attention, that thoſe who had the ſcriptures and valued them, as to think they had eternal life in them, yet they would not come unto Chriſt, of whom they teſtified; and "who was and is alone the life as
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035518_0063_10055BB20A9C04C8"/>
well as the light of men," John i. 4. Therefore it may be well to take care of putting the letter, the teſtimony, the decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, concerning an object, for the object itſelf; for our Lord did not ſay the ſcriptures is the way; but "I am the way, the truth, and the life, and no man cometh unto the Father but by me," John xiv. 6. And learn the difference between the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the outward word, and the word that was in the beginning, John i. 1, before the ſcriptures, "the word high in the mouth, and in the heart;" Rom. x. 8, "which is quick and powerful, ſharper than a two-edged ſword, dividing aſunder ſoul and ſpirit, joints and marrow, and is a diſcerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, before whom all things are naked and open," Heb. iv. 12. and of whom, as I before obſerved, the ſcriptures teſtify; and without whoſe all powerful aid they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a dead letter, a ſealed book. The apoſtle declared, the things of God can only be known but by the Spirit of God, 1 Cor. ii. 11. They are fooliſhneſs to the natural man. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I think we ſhould be careful how we attempt to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the truths, which are contained in the ſcriptures by our own underſtandings; but rather be willing, as the apoſtle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends, to become fools, that we may be truely wiſe, 1 Cor. iii. 18.</p>
            <p>I would now offer a few remarks on thoſe two ordinances or ceremonies, Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper as they are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the firſt, as practiſed by thoſe I more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly addreſs myſelf to, little need be ſaid; as ſprinkling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants is not even an imitation of true baptiſm, has no relation to it whatever, nor do I believe, can there be found a ſingle precept or example for it in any of the ſcriptures of truth. I am well perſuaded it is, like many other things of the kind, a mere po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh invention, in the times of darkneſs and apoſtacy, as a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute for the reality; not in any one reſpect calculated to anſwer any good purpoſe whatever. It may be well ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to conſider a language uſed at that ceremony, that 'this child is regenerate, and grafted into the body of Chriſt's
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035518_0064_10055BB5D2A869B8"/>
church;' and in the catechiſm reſpecting it, that 'he is therein made a member of Chriſt, a child of God, and an inheritor of the kingdom of Heaven.' Now let every conſiderate perſon ſolemnly aſk himſelf, whether he really believes ſuch effects are really produced by it. If it is poſſible that any one can think ſo, his ideas of regeneration, and Chriſt's church alſo, differ very widely from mine.</p>
            <p>Let it be conſidered alſo, what people are taught to promiſe at this ceremony: To renounce the devil and all his works, the pomps and vanities of this wicked world, and all the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful luſts of the fleſh; to keep God's holy will and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to walk in the ſame all the days of their lives.' Are they not here required to promiſe what is believed and confeſſed to be impoſſible to perform; for ſurely if it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, they would not 'be miſerable ſinners, doing what they ought not to do,' &amp;c.</p>
            <p>That baptiſm is neceſſary, abſolutely neceſſary, for every member of Chriſt's church, I fully believe; but I believe, no application of water, even when rightly imitated, is the one true baptiſm. It is not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, which is all outward elementary water can do, but the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of the Holy Ghoſt and of Fire,' Matt iii. 11, even a being baptized in the name, that is nature, of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, thereby experiencing the conſuming of the earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part in themſelves, and a being cleanſed and purified from all filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of the Lord; for the apoſtle ſays, "As many as are baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt, "Gal. iii. 27. not imaginarily, but really; and being buried with him, by this ſpiritual baptiſm into death, even a death unto ſin: that "like as Chriſt was raiſed from the dead; by the glory of the Father, ſo they alſo will walk in the newneſs of life," Rom. vi 4. And again, If any man be in Chriſt he is a new creature, old things are paſſed away, all things become new, and all of God:" 2 Cor. v.
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035518_0065_10055BB75AA672E0"/>
17. and if all of God, there can be no ſin, for "ſin is of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and not of God." 1 John iii. 8.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to that other ceremony, called the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, notwithſtanding I am ſenſible of the deep rooted prejudice in favour of it, I feel no diſcouragement: under a belief that a glorious day is dawning, when clouds and ſhadows, ſigns and appearances, ſhall give place to reality, to the pure eſſential ſubſtance. I am perfectly ſatisfied in mine own mind reſpecting it, and will endeavour to give my reaſons, why I believe it is not of that conſequence or obligation many fix upon it.</p>
            <p>That our Lord, the night before he ſuffered, took bread and brake it, and gave to his diſciples, as alſo the cup, I believe; and that he ſaid, this do in rememberance of me; but that he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined it to be an ordinance I cannot find. I preſume it will be allowed to be a part of the feaſt of the Jewiſh paſſover, as our Lord ſaid, "With deſire, I have deſired to eat this paſſover with you, before I ſuffer," Luke xxii. 10. and which was a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable type or figure of Chriſt, who was the very Paſchal Lamb, the ſubſtance or antitype itſelf. That the bread and wine, as a part of the paſſover, repreſented the body and blood of Chriſt, to be broken and ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins, I preſume will alſo be allowed. Now as there is certainly a very eſſential difference between the ſign and the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, let us conſider a little, which is of moſt conſequence, or whether both are of obligation. I expect none to whom I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs myſelf will deny, that Chriſt was and is really the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and antitype of every type and figure, under the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic ceremonial diſpenſation. This then being one of thoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures repreſenting the death of Chriſt; the ſubſtance being come, the type fulfilled, what need of the ſhadow; why not give place, as others are acknowledged to do? The apoſtle, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſome, remarks, "As often as ye eat this bread, and drink this cup, ye do ſhew the Lord's death, till he come." 1 Cor. xi. 26. But this I think, by no means implies that it was an enjoined ordinance, but rather, that thoſe to whom he was writing, continued in the uſe or obſervance of the Jewiſh paſſover
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:035518_0066_10055BBB082BE758"/>
This I think, cannot appear improbable, when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that for a time it was taught by ſome of the diſciples, that "it was needful to be circumciſed, and to keep the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>w of Moſes," Acts xv. 5. of courſe this among the reſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it appears to me, that they, as yet, knew not, in a ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſenſe, the coming of Chriſt; that is, his ſpiritual appearance in their hearts: an inference which ſeems to be confirmed by what is recorded of ſome, who had been baptized with John's baptiſm, that is of water, yet had not ſo much as heard whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there were an Holy Ghoſt, Acts xix 2. the promiſed mode of his coming again, John xvi. 7. Again, the apoſtle ſays, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto wiſe men, no doubt ſpiritually wiſe, "The cup of bleſſing we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt? The bread we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt?" 1 Cor. x. 15.16. Can it be ſuppoſed that he here alludes to outward bread and wine? for if he did, all who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of that ceremony, let them be who they may, or what they may, have communion with Chriſt. Surely that would be join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing light and darkneſs, Chriſt and Belial, righteouſneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs together, in direct oppoſition to the ſame apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's plain declaration to the ſame people. 2. Cor vi. xv. He ſays again, "Ye cannot drink of the cup of the Lord, and the cup of devils; ye cannot be partakers of the Lord's table, and the table of devils." 1 Cor. x. 20. Now it is very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious, that any can partake of the outward bread and wine, therefore that cannot be the cup and table of the Lord. Again, what is recorded of the diſciples breaking bread from houſe to houſe, Acts ii. 24, I think by no means implies ſuch a ceremony, but rather a ſocial way of living among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; as it is ſaid, they had all things common verſe 44 and, from what immediately follows, "did eat their meat with glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſingleneſs of heart," verſe 46, plainly alluding to their common meals. It is alſo I think, very obſervable, that when the apoſtles were aſſembled at Jeruſalem, to conſider what was neceſſary to be enjoined to the believing Gentiles, this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035518_0067_10055BBD6F8F2BC0"/>
was not even mentioned: which had it been neceſſary, would ſure not have been omitted, conſidering the things which were then enjoined; moſt of which have ſince been laid aſide, Acts xv. 20. But our Lord's own words appear to me decidedly to diſcountenance the outward ſign; as where he emphatically calls himſelf the "Bread of Life." "That his fleſh is meat indeed, and his blood drink indeed, and that who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ate and drank it had eternal life." John vi. 46, &amp;c. And to reprove their carnal ideas of outward eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, verſe 52. and to direct their minds to the ſpiritual alluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he adds, "What, and if you ſhall ſee the Son of Man aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend up where he was before," verſe 62, how will ye eat him then, not in outward bread and wine, "it is the ſpirit that quickeneth, the fleſh (or outward food) profiteth nothing."</p>
            <p>I believe there are among thoſe whom I addreſs myſelf to, ſuch as are ſenſible of the neceſſity of this ſpiritual communion, and are truly deſirous to partake thereof. Far be it from me to wound any of theſe. I do tenderly ſalute them, and feel a degree of unity with the leaſt appearance of the true ſeed of the kingdom: I would not hurt the lead plant of the Lord's own right hand planting. However ſome little differences may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, yet let me ſay to theſe in a ſpirit of love and unity, as this is acknowledged to be but a ſign or token, why is this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, when others of equal authority and obligation are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with? For inſtance, that of circumciſion, which our Lord ſubmitted to, Luke ii. 21; and which for a time, even after his aſcenſion, was enjoined by his diſciples as I before quoted; Why this laid aſide? It may perhaps be anſwered, this ſign according to the apoſtle's definition of it, repreſented the circumciſion made without hands, in putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, Col. ii 11. I fully believe it did, and as it is equally true that bread and wine is alſo a ſign, there appears to me not a ſhadow of a reaſon why the one ſhould be continued in preference to the other: the thing ſignified by both being of equal obligation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:035518_0068_10055BBFD3ABE380"/>
Again, it is worthy of obſervation that the beloved diſciple John, in his relation, makes not the leaſt mention of this cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; but is very particular in giving an account of our Lord's waſhing his diſciples feet. Why is not this ceremony obſerved, as it appears to be more particularly enjoined than the other? For ſays Chriſt "Ye call me Maſter, and Lord and ye ſay well, for ſo I am; if I then your Lord and Maſter have waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed your feet, ye ought alſo to waſh one another's feet, for I have given you an example, that ye ſhould do as I have done unto you" John xiii. 13. Now where can there be found ſo ſtrong an injunction for the other, that of bread and wine? If it is anſwered, that was a ſign or figure to teach humility and love to each other which I readily admit it was. I think it is neceſſary to prove, that the other is ſomewhat more than a ſign, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port its continuance in preference; which I expect will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be attempted. That it was not practiſed or obſerved as an ordinance by the apoſtles, I think evidently appears from the whole tenor of their writings. Paul reproves ſome for being ſubject to ordinances. "Touch not, taſte not, handle not," ſays he, "which all are to periſh with the uſing." Col. ii. 20. and doth not outward bread and wine periſh with the uſing? The apoſtle well knew the true living bread is not of a periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able nature. Again, he ſays, "Let no man judge you in meat and in drink, or in reſpect to the holy day, new moon, or the ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath, which" he adds, "are a ſhadow of things to come, but the body, (the ſubſtance) is of Chriſt, verſe 16. In another place he ſays, "The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt." Rom. xiv. 17. And to ſome others he ſaid "I am afraid of you, left I have beſtowed on you labour in vain," becauſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had known God, had taſted ſomewhat of the ſubſtance, they turned again to the weak and beggarly elements, whereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to they deſired again to be in bondage. Gal iv 9. "Ye obſerve days, and months, and times, and years." verſe 10, ſaid he, which he had declared to be but ſhadows of good things; and I fear the ſame language is too applicable to many, who make a very high profeſſion in this day.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="70" facs="unknown:035518_0069_10055BC1D7B1C7D8"/>
From what I have obſerved on this ſubject, I think to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced mind, it muſt appear that the true ſupper of the Lord is an inward, ſpiritual communion. "Behold," ſays Chriſt, "I ſtand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me," Rev. iii. 20; and that the outward bread and wine, was nothing more than a part of the Jewiſh ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial diſpenſation; neither commanded to, nor practiſed generally by, the Gentiles in the apoſtle's days. For, I would juſt add, if it is a neceſſary ordinance; if in other words, it is what by many it is aſſerted to be, the effects of it would be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident; for our Lord ſaid, "Whoſoever ate his fleſh and drank his blood, had eternal life." Now I preſume no one to whom I now addreſs myſelf, will impute ſuch an effect to outward bread and wine; therefore it cannot be the Lord's ſupper. We no where read of two ſuppers. The difference between the ſign and thing ſignified, the ſhadow and the ſubſtance, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve many are in a degree ſenſible of; and as the ſubſtance, the reality is to be partaken of, yea abſolutely neceſſary; (for ſaid our Lord, "Except ye eat the fleſh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, ye have no life in you;" John vi. 53.) and as I before obſerved we read of but <hi>one</hi> ſupper of the Lord; ſurely it is of conſequence rightly to know which is indeed the true ſupper.</p>
            <p>I have no doubt but there are thoſe who in ſincerity and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of heart continue in the uſe of the ſign; far be it from me to judge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>eſe. I have only a caution to give in love, that where theſe ſigns are regarded, it may be as to the Lord, and and not unto men. See Rom xiv. 6. I fully believe religion doth not conſiſt in obſerving, or not obſerving, outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. For as the apoſtle ſays, "In Chriſt Jeſus, neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion; but a new creature;" Gal. vi. 15. It is not a name, a profeſſion, or any outward obſervance; but I am not without a fear that many regard them as to men, and are in bondage unto them, and ſo ſettled down at eaſe in them, that they will hardly hear
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035518_0070_10055BC43368D7C8"/>
the leaſt objection to them. Such perhaps muſt be left for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> time: however, I have given ſome of my reaſons for abſenting myſelf from your communion, and why I believe the worſhip there performed, <hi>is not the worſhip which the Lord requireth;</hi> that it is not agreeable, but contrary to, the Scriptures; that it is not the means of grace, and ordinance of God" but the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention and imagination of man; that it is wrong in principle and in practice; in <hi>principle,</hi> becauſe you are taught you muſt not expect deliverance from ſin in this life, whereas the ſcriptures teſtify the contrary; <hi>in practice,</hi> becauſe you worſhip in your own wills, and teach for doctrines the commandments of men, which our Lord teſtified againſt; Mark vii. 7: yea in an unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate ſtate, according to your own confeſſion, for a ſinner is not regenerate. Therefore, what I have heard among you, that your beſt ſervices are polluted, is ſtrictly true; for while you yourſelves are in the polluted ſtate, all your performances are polluted alſo. "For who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean; not one," Job xiv. 4; but it may be well to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, it ſtands an unchangeable truth, "That the ſacrifices of the wicked are an abomination to the Lord," Prov. xxi. 27. and though we may amuſe ourſelves with the vain idea that all is well, I do aſſuredly believe, that to offer any acceptable ſacrifice or ſervice, we muſt know, experimentally know, a being waſhed, ſanctified, and juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God. 1 Cor. vi. 11. Therefore remember a language of old to ſome who had no health in them, but were unſound from head to foot, as many confeſs they now are. "To what purpoſe is the multitude of your ſacrifices," v. 12. "Bring no more vain oblations, incenſe is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bomination to me, the new moons and ſabbaths, the calling of aſſemblies I cannot away with, it is iniquity even the ſolemn meeting. When you ſpread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes, yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear." ver. 13, 14. And conſider the exhortation to them, "Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes: ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well," &amp;c. ver. 16. Then it is added, "Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035518_0071_10055BC722499A68"/>
be white as ſnow: though they be red like crimſon they ſhall be as wool. If ye be willing and obedient, ye ſhall eat the good of the land; but if ye refuſe and rebel, ye ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with the ſword: for the mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it." ver. 18. Oh, how awful is this denunciation now fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing around us! It is the fervent breathing of my ſpirit, that this highly profeſſing, much favoured nation, who have been calling abundantly upon the Lord with their mouths and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring him with their lips, may avert the impending ſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I know, friends, from a degree of experience, that there are many and various appearances ſigns and ſhadows, ſet up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong profeſſing Chriſtians; ſome of which I have pointed out. I now wiſh to direct, according to the ability I am at preſent favoured with, to the reality or ſubſtance itſelf; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable treaſure which I had long in vain ſought for without, among the various appearances, I at laſt found to be within. I can anticipate the ſurpriſe, and perhaps the indignation, the word <hi>within</hi> may excite in ſome minds, who may be ready to exclaim, Can there be any thing good in man? Yes, friends, the ſovereign good, the only good, is to be found there; and I deſire your patient attention while I endeavour to remove that unjuſt, deluſive, yea too deſtructive idea, that nothing good is to be found in man. I believe it is the grand artifice, the moſt ſucceſsful inſinuation, of the great adverſary of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, to divert the attention, from <hi>that</hi> which is alone able ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to deſtroy his kingdom or rule in the heart, to objects without, to ſimilitudes and appearances. (Myſtery Babylon.) This good then, though in man is not or man, it is not natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to him; but a free, ſpontaneous, unmerited gift. This good is, with reverence be it ſpoken even God himſelf, a truth I believe of the utmoſt importance to be experimentally known by every individual; and a truth abundantly teſtified to in the ſacred writings; as the ground work, the ſubſtance the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of real religion; a language alſo repeatedly expreſſed
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035518_0072_10055BC973C38E70"/>
by the profeſſors of Chriſtianity; though the truth, the reality of it, appears ſo little known, as by many even to be denied. Do not you frequently read, "I will dwell in them, and walk in them; I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people," 2 Cor. vi. 16. "If a man love me," ſaid our Lord, "he will keep my words, and my father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him," John xiv. 23. "The Comforter, even the Spirit of Truth," proceeding from the Father, ſaid he, "dwelleth with you and ſhall be in you," ver. 17. "Know ye not," ſaid the Apoſtle, "that Jeſus Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobates?" 2 Cor. xiii. 5, and that your bodies are the temples of the living God? 1. Cor. vi. 19. I could multiply quotations of Scriptures, to prove this great important truth, but am ſenſible that thoſe to whom I addreſs myſelf are well acquainted with the words. 'You are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reading, of "Chriſt within the hope of glory," Col. i. 27<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> under various ſimilitudes; but what is the reaſon, he is not known there? it is an important queſtion. What is the reaſon, I again repeat it, that Chriſt ſo often read of in the Scriptures as within, notwithſtanding ſo much talk and imaginations about him, is not known there in reality? I believe, friends, I can tell you the reaſon why he, the one great foundation, is not known, where alone he is truly to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Becauſe he is not ſought for there, but in ſomething without ſome appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance or repreſentation of him, a knowledge gathered from men or books, from the hiſtory or outward letter, which, however highly it may be valued, I believe is merely notional. The real experimental knowledge is only known by his internal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, his ſecond coming, without ſin, unto ſalvation; Heb. ix. 23, and the operation and effects thereby produced. See Mal. iii, 3. "The kingdom of God," ſaid our Lord, "cometh not by obſervation:" man with all his wiſdom, is unable to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend it, neither ſhall they ſay, "Lo here is Chriſt, or lo there," not in any outward appearance, "for behold the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God is within you." Luke xvii, 20, 21. "Say not in

Rom. x. 6, 7, 8. Our Lord repreſented this great truth by various objects or ſimilitudes, to convey ſpiritual inſtruction to his diſciples; as a treaſure hid in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ield; Mat. xiii, 44, ſeed ſown in the ground; Mark iv. 26, a grain of muſtard ſeed; Mat. xiii. 31, a little leaven hid in meal; ver. 33. plainly alluding to this ineſtimable treaſure as hid in the heart, the earthly part of man. There were ſome of whom our Lord ſaid, having ears they heard not; they could not underſtand the ſpiritual meaning of his parables; but to ſome he ſaid, "Unto you it is given to know the myſteries of the kingdom of God." Mark iv. 11. Now, friends, it is of conſequence to know of which number we are, whether theſe are ſtill to us as parables, or whether we know <hi>that</hi> which unſolds their true meaning: "I am the light of the world;" ſaid Chriſt, "he that followeth me ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life." John viii. 12.</p>
            <p>The apoſtle ſays there is no communion between light and darkneſs. 2 Cor. vi. 14. If we have not light, we muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be in darkneſs. There is a ſpiritual light, as well as a natural. This great apoſtle to the Gentiles, declaring his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to preach the goſpel, ſaid it was to turn people from darkneſs, to light, from the power of ſatan unto God. Acts xxvi. 18. Of what conſequence then is it to be acquainted with this light, by which alone we can diſcern between good and evil. "All things." ſaid the apoſtle, "that are reproved, are made manifeſt by the light; for whatſoever doth make manifeſt is light." Eph. v. 13. That we may know what this light is the ſcriptures abundantly declare. John the Baptiſt was ſent to bear witneſs of this light, which is the true light, which light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth every man that cometh into the world. John 1. 8, 9. In him, i. e. Chriſt was life, and the life was the light of men. ver. 4. This light ſhineth in darkneſs, even the dark heart of man;
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035518_0074_10055BCD3456F8B8"/>
though the darkneſs comprehended it not. ver. 5. This is the light of the glorious goſpel; therefore, friends, I caution you to beware of calling it a natural light, or a new lights, as many have done. For I believe the ſame light, if attended to and its diſcoveries obeyed, will eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> the ſame works ſpiritually in the heart, or inner man, as it formerly did on the bodies of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Therefore I believe there is great danger of ſpeaking evil of the light, for whoever do, confeſs they are ſtrangers to it, and of courſe are walking in darkneſs, for there is but one true ſpiritual light. And "If we ſay we have fellowſhip with him and walk in darkneſs, <hi>we</hi> lie, and do not the truth: but if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his ſon, cleanſeth us from all ſin." 1. John, i. 6, 7.</p>
            <p>Our Lord himſelf plainly declared, that "Every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved; but he that doeth truth cometh to the light, that his deeds may be made manifeſt, that they are wrought in God." John. iii. 20, 21. Therefore it is not ſtrange that thoſe who plead for ſin, which is evil, ſhould ſpeak againſt this light, and call it a natural light; or any thing, to excuſe themſelves; becauſe it cannot but condemn them. Thoſe things which the light, if attended to, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ould manifeſt to be evil, are too dearly loved, to be parted with, while they can perſuade themſelves they are ſecure in retaining them. I ſpeak from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and do earneſtly recommend a turning to this light within from all the <hi>'Lo heres,'</hi> and <hi>'Lo theres:'</hi> the various appearances, ſigns, and ſhadows, ſet up by the will and wiſdom of men, in the times of darkneſs and apoſtacy; even to <hi>Chriſt within,</hi> the hope of glory, the true foundation, 1 Cor. iii. 11; the rock againſt which even the gates of hell ſhall not prevail, Mat. xvi. 18; nor all the oppoſition of men, as it is faithfully abode in. This I believe is the ſubſtance of every ſhadow, the reality of every appearance, the word nigh in the mouth and in the heart; the true anointing, which is truth and no lie, and
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035518_0075_10055BCF653E7C20"/>
which teacheth all things without need of man's teaching. 1. John ii. 27. This is the new covenant, graciouſly promiſed by the Moſt High. "I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people; and they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord, for they ſhall all know me from the leaſt of them unto the greateſt of them, ſaith the Lord." Jer. xxxi. 33, 34.</p>
            <p>Behold, ſaid our Lord, the kingdom of God is within you. Luke xvii. 21. The ſeed of the kingdom which is ſown in the hearts, though too ſmall for the eye of man's wiſdom to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though it is ſtill to the high profeſſing Jew a ſtumbling block, and to the worldly wiſe Greek fooliſhneſs; yet it is to thoſe who hear its call and obey it, Chriſt the power of God, and the wiſdom of God. 1. Cor. i. 23, 24. This I believe is the new birth, without which our Lord declared no one even could ſee the kingdom of God. John iii. 3. The birth which is not of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God, John, i. 13. For that which is born of the fleſh, however high and ſpecious its appearance, is ſtill fleſh; and that which is born of the ſpirit, however mean and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the eye of man's wiſdom, is ſpirit. The goſpel is a ſpiritual diſpenſation. The ſpirit of truth inwardly manifeſted, our Lord promiſed ſhould guide into all truth. John xvi. 13. The apoſtles were not to leave Jeruſalem till they had received it. Acts i. 4. And then we are informed, "They ſpake as the ſpirit gave them utterance." Acts ii. 4. We have no reaſon to ſuppoſe they uſed any form of words, neither that they ſpake when or where they choſe; but we are frequently informed of their going or forbearing; as by the ſpirit they were directed; Acts viii, 29. xix. 7, &amp;c. neither are we to ſuppoſe that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and direction of the ſpirit was confined to any period of time; for, ſays our Lord, "Lo, I am with you alway, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world." Mat. xxviii. 20. What a departure from their example and precepts is lamentably conſpicuous among moſt profeſſing Chriſtians; who have invented various
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035518_0076_10055BD24BEA1450"/>
images, forms, and modes of worſhip, which they can perform when they pleaſe; evidently acknowledging that they think the influence and aſſiſtance of the ſpirit unneceſſary; at leaſt that they will begin at a venture, whether it may come or not. Surely it may be well to conſider, whether it is not offering ſtrange fire before the Lord. Lev. x. 1. The only <hi>true worſhip</hi> under the goſpel diſpenſation, is, agreeably to our Lord's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs declaration, <hi>that which is in ſpirit and in truth,</hi> John iv. 24, and as the influences and movings of the ſpirit, (although ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely neceſſary, as that no acceptable worſhip can be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed without them) are not at our command; how proper, yea, how needful then, is a humble, ſilent, dependent waiting upon Him, who alone can adminiſter this aſſiſtance; that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the true preparation of the heart may be experienced, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive whatever He, who ſearcheth the heart, and who alone knoweth what is good for thoſe who wait upon him, may be pleaſed to adminiſter: whether immediately, by his ſtill ſmall voice in the ſecret of the heart; or inſtrumentally, by whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever he may pleaſe to appoint!</p>
            <p>"They that wait upon the Lord," ſaid the Prophet, "ſhall renew their ſtrength." Iſa. xl. 31. It is the profeſſed object of moſt aſſemblies for religious worſhip, <hi>to wait upon the Lord.</hi> Now, whether thoſe who in ſolemn humble ſilence, wait to feel the influences of the ſpirit, to inſtruct and enable, when and what to offer, or what immediately to receive from the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of good, are ſuch as that promiſe applies to; or thoſe who are always ready to begin, either in a preſcribed form, or in the exerciſe of their own natural or acquired abilities, whether they may have the aſſiſtance ſo neceſſary or not; I think a little ſerious conſideration may determine. Indeed the plain expreſs meaning of the term, <hi>Waiting,</hi> appears to me to be a ſilent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive expectation of ſomething; and if it is weightily conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, that, at ſuch times, we more particularly profeſs to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the ſacred preſence of Him, "who ſearcheth the heart, trieth the reins, and requireth truth in the inward parts;" who cannot poſſibly be deceived or amuſed by the moſt plauſible
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035518_0077_10055BD3E1387C70"/>
expreſſions or the moſt eloquent language; who has decidedly condemned the practice of drawing near to him with the mouth, and honouring him with the lips, whilſt the heart is far from him; Iſa. xxix. 13. ſurely it is needful at ſuch times to wait, ſilently wait, for the reception of ſpiritual power, leſt we ſhould be like thoſe who offer the ſacrifice of fools. Eccleſ. v. 1. "Let not thine heart," ſaid the wiſe man, "be haſty to utter any thing before God, for God is in heaven and thou upon earth; therefore let thy words be few." ver. 2. "Without me," ſaid our bleſſed Lord, "ye can do nothing." John xv. 5. Yet the practice of many who profeſs to follow him, evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that they think they can do without him, for they are, as to words and outward performances, always ready. The apoſtle plainly declared, that "we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but it is the ſpirit that helpeth our infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities." Rom. viii. 26. Then what are all the arts of compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the powers of human eloquence, without this aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, but as "ſounding braſs or a tinkling cymbal?" "When we pray," ſaid our Lord, "uſe not vain repetitions as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then do: for they think they ſhall be heard, for their much ſpeaking;" Mat. vi. 7. a language too applicable I fear, not only to the preſcribed formal prayers, but to the more private extempore productions: as though prayer conſiſted in outward expreſſions, an idea repeatedly condemned in the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
            <p>The apoſtle, after ſaving we know not what to pray for, adds, "The ſpirit itſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered," and Chriſt called them hypocrites who prayed to be ſeen of men; Mat. vi. 5, and directed his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to pray in ſecret to the father, who ſeeth in ſecret. ver. 6. The apoſtle alſo recommends a praying always, with all prayer and ſupplication in the ſpirit and watching thereunto with all perſeverance. Eph. vi. 18. He does not recommend to begin ſinging as ſoon as they conclude a prayer. In another place, he exhorts to a "Continuing inſtant in prayer;" Rom. xii. 12. again, "Pray without ceaſing;" 1. Theſ. v. 17. from all which
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:035518_0078_1005560DEA1A2320"/>
I think it muſt appear that <hi>there may be true prayer without words, and that there may be alſo words without prayer.</hi> I believe, there are thoſe poſſeſſed of conſiderable abilities, a ready flow of words, and a pleaſing eloquent delivery, who can at any time when they pleaſe, deliver what I have heard called an excellent prayer; without waiting to feel that influence, which can alone enable to "pray with the ſpirit, and with true underſtanding;" but though ſuch exerciſes may produce a temporary warmth, both in ſpeaker and hearer, I believe, it will be found to be only a fire of their own kindling, a mere appearance, and not the effects of the live coal from the true altar. Iſa. vi. 6. The ſame obſervations are equally applicable to every other external performance of worſhip, public or private: for however it may affect the outward ear, yea, and kindle ſparks as it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a temporary warmth; if it does not proceed from the immediate ſenſible movings of the ſpirit of truth, I much fear the appellation of will-worſhip is too applicable to it.</p>
            <p>I have alſo had a fear, that a language of old, reſpecting ſome of whom it was ſaid, "They limited the Holy One of Iſrael," Pſa. lxxviii. 41. is applicable to moſt profeſſing religious ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, where any particular man or ſet of men, aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the excluſive right of teaching or preaching: a practice I believe totally repugnant to the goſpel diſpenſation, and the uniform example and precepts of Chriſt and his apoſtles. For I fully believe that <hi>no human authority, call, qualification, or or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, can make a miniſter of Chriſt. That is the perogative of Chriſt himſelf.</hi> It is abſolutely neceſſary that every individual Chriſtian ſhould be born of the Spirit; John iii. 5. and ſurely it moſt alſo be neceſſary that the miniſters of Chriſt ſhould, in an eſpecial manner, be ſo too. Paul ſaid he was made an apoſtle, "Not of men, neither by man, but by Jeſus Chriſt and God the Father." Gal. i. 1. And, as I before obſerved, the diſpenſation of the goſpel being 'a diſpenſation of the ſpirit,' the miniſters thereof are miniſters of the ſpirit, and not of the letter: not miniſters of the words only, though ſcripture words themſelves; but of the "word of eternal life," even of the "word which
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:035518_0079_10055C2792E3F7D0"/>
was in the beginning, which liveth and abideth for ever." 1. Pet. i. 23. That word which is "quick and powerful, diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thoughts and intents of the heart." Heb. iv. 12. Words may have, and no doubt have, their ſervice, as the ſpirit brings to rememberance, and giveth utterance; but to ſteal the words of Scripture, ſee Jer. xxiii. 30, 31. and put them in a premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated form, however eloquently they may be delivered, I believe is not preaching the goſpel. But I believe that they who are particularly called, qualified, and ſent by Chriſt himſelf, as I believe every true miniſter is, will not preſume to preach or pray, when, where, or what they pleaſe; but as they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately moved and directed by the ſpirit of Chriſt, inwardly revealed; ſee Gal. i. 1.16. who can alone know what is needful to be adminiſtered, and theſe as they freely receive, they will, agreeably to our Lord's command, <hi>Freely give,</hi> Mat. x. 8, &amp;c. 'without any view to temporal intereſt whatever.' And as they are not their own, they cannot diſpoſe of their time or talents, according to their own wills; but as He who hath call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them is pleaſed to direct.</p>
            <p>To conclude: the few obſervations I have now offered, may perhaps, to unprejudiced minds, be ſufficient to evince the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpiritual nature of the goſpel diſpenſation; and that <hi>ſigns and figures, all external ceremonial performances, are totally aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from that worſhip, which can only be performed in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> John iv. 23, 24.</p>
            <p>They may alſo evince that the only neceſſary qualification for true worſhip, is the influence and direction of the ſpirit of truth, inwardly revealed: that this neceſſary aſſiſtance is not confined to time or place, nor to any particular man or ſet of men. For as the apoſtle declared, "The manifeſtation of the ſpirit is given to every man, to profit withal," 1. Cor. xii. 7<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I believe there are no individuals arrived to the years of diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but who are favoured with a ſufficient portion thereof, if properly attended to, to direct them into the paths of true judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The word, even the word of eternal life, is nigh to all, nor need any look to men for inſtruction; but this ſame anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:035518_0080_1005561A90AC95D0"/>
if the mind is ſimply and unreſervedly directed to it, teacheth all things and is truth. 1 John ii. 27. Who is there, who has not felt its ſecret reproofs for evil, and its approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for good? To this true teacher, of whoſe all ſufficient aid I have thankfully to acknowledge a degree of experience, I do earneſtly recommend the particular, unwearied, faithful attention of every individual.</p>

engroſſed ſo much of my Time, I would have taken Opportunity to anſwer my dear Friend's Letter e're now, and upon that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count my Delay will be the more excuſable.</p>
               <p>The News thou haſt heard of my late Change, is really true, I cannot conceal it, for it is what I glory in; neither was it any Proſpect of temporal Advantage that induced me to it, but a ſincere Love to the Truth, and pure Regard to my own Soul: Neither can I be ſufficiently thankful to God, that he hath let me live to this glorious Day, &amp; not cut me off in the Midſt of my Sins and Provocations againſt Him; He is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance: He hath brought me off from the Forms and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of Religion, and let me ſee in a more illuſtrious Manner what is the Life and Subſtance of it, as he found me in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree faithful to that Meaſure of Light and Knowledge he hath beſtowed on me, whilſt I was in the Communion of the <hi>Church of England;</hi> therefore he was pleaſed of late, as I humbly waited upon him, to make known to me greater and deeper Myſteries of his Kingdom: And I can truly ſay, that I find by daily Experience, as I keep low and retired into that pure Gift which he hath planted within me, Things are every Day more and more cleared up to me, and the Truth ſhines and prevails greatly over the Kingdom of Darkneſs; And if I ſhould now turn my Back upon ſuch Manifeſtations as theſe, and entangle myſelf again with the Yoke of Bondage, ſurely I ſhould grieve the Holy Spirit: So that he might juſtly withdraw his kind Operations, and never return more to aſſiſt and comfort me: For God is not mocked; Religion is a very ſerious and weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thing; Repentance and Salvation are not to be trifled with, nor is turning to God to be put off till our own Time, Leiſure or Conveniency, but we muſt love and cheriſh the leaſt Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Chriſt, not ſlighting or deſpiſing the Day of ſmall Things, but embrace the firſt Opportunity of following Chriſt in any of his Commands: When he ſpeaks, there is ſuch Force and Authority in it that we cannot ſtand to cavil, diſpute or aſk Queſtions; for unleſs we will be ſo obſtinate as to ſhut our Eyes

againſt the Sun, we muſt needs confeſs to the Truth of his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, and preſently ſtrike in with it. And therefore, when for ſeveral Weeks I had lived more privately and retiredly in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> than was uſual, Faſting twice or thrice in a Week, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, ſpending my Time in reading the Scriptures and in Prayer to God, this was a good Preparation of my Mind to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Truth which he was then about to make known to me: I lamented the Errors of my paſt Life, and was deſirous to attain a more excellent Degree of Holineſs than I had diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the <hi>Church of England.</hi> In this religous Retirement God knew the Breathings of my Soul, how ſincere I was, and reſigned to him when alone; I wanted him to ſet me free, and to ſpeak Peace and Comfort to my Soul, which was grieved and wearied with the Burthen of Sin: For tho' I had ſtrictly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed myſelf to the Orders and Ceremonies of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and had kept myſelf from running into any great or ſcandalous Enormities, the Fear of the Almighty preſerving me; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>As for a ſober and plauſable Converſation in the Eye of the World, I knew that was a very eaſy Attainment; a good na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Temper, with the Advantage of a liberal Education, will quickly furniſh a Man with Abilities for that, ſo that he ſhall be looked upon as a Saint, and very ſpiritual, when perhaps in Chains of Darkneſs, in the Gall of Bitterneſs, and in the very Bond of Iniquity. If this ſort of Righteouſneſs would have done; perhaps I might make as fair Pretenſions that Way as ſome others: But alas! I ſoon ſaw the Emptineſs and Unſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs of thoſe Things: This is a covering that will not protect or hide us from the Wrath of the Almighty, when he comes to Judgment: 'Tis not a Man's natural Temper, nor his Education, that makes him a good Chriſtian; this is not the Righteouſneſs,

I thank my God, I can truly ſay, Whilſt I uſed thoſe Prayers I did it with Zeal and Sincerity, in his Fear and Dread; but ſtill, I ceaſed not my earneſt Supplication to him in private, that he would ſhew me ſomething more excellent, that I might get a compleat Victory over all my Luſts and Paſſions, and might perfect Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs before him; for I found a great many Sins and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes daily attending me: And tho' I made frequent Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to forſake thoſe Sins, yet ſtill the Temptation was too ſtrong for me ſo that often I had Cauſe to complain with the Apoſtle, in the Bitterneſs of my Soul, <hi>O wretched Man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</hi> Who ſhall ſet me free, and give me Strength to triumph over Sin, the World and the Devil? That I may in every Thing pleaſe God, and there may not be the leaſt Thought. Word or Motion, Geſture or Action, but what is exactly agreeable to his moſt holy Will, as if I ſaw him ſtanding before me, and as if I were to be judged by him for the Thoughts of my Heart next Moment. O divine Life! O ſeraphiek Soul! O that I could always Stand here! for here is no reflection, no Sorrow, no Repentance! but at God's right Hand there is perfect Peace, and a river of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable joy. O that we might imitate the Life of Jeſus, and be throughly furniſhed unto every good Word and Work! This was the frequent Breathing of my Soul to God when I was

in the Country, but more eſpecially after I had left my new Preferment of a Chaplain, and took private Lodgings in <hi>London:</hi> In this Retirement I hope I may ſay, without Boaſting, that I was very devout and Religious, and I found great Comfort and Refreſhment in it from the Lord, who let me ſee the Beauty of Holineſs; and the ſweetneſs that ariſes from an humbled morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Life, was then very pleaſant to my Taſte, and I rejoiced in it more than in all the Delights and Pleaſures of the World.</p>
               <p>And now it pleaſed God to ſhew me, that if I would indeed live ſtrictly and holily as becomes the Goſpel, then I muſt leave the Communion of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> but knew not yet which Way to determine myſelf, nor to what Body of Men I ſhould join, who were more orthodox, and more regular in their Lives. As for the <hi>Quakers,</hi> ſo called, I was ſo great a Stranger to them, that I had never read any of their Books, nor do I remember, that ever I converſed with any one Man of that Communion in my whole Life: I think there was one in <hi>Foxly</hi> while I was a Curate there, But I never ſaw the Man, tho' I went ſeveral times to his Houſe on Purpoſe to talk with him, and to bring him off from his wild and mad Enthuſiaſm, as I then ignorantly thought it to be: As for that Way, I know it was every where ſpoken againſt; he that had a mind to appear more witty and ingenious than the reſt, would chuſe this for the Subject of his profane Jeſts and Drollery; with this he makes Sport, and diverts the Company; for a <hi>Quaker</hi> is but another Name for a Fool or a Mad-man, and was ſcarce ever mention'd but with Scorn and Contempt. As for Drollery, I confeſs I was never any great Friend to it; but indeed if all was true that was laid to the <hi>Quaker's</hi> Charge, I thought that they were ſome of the worſt People that ever appeared in the World, and wondered with what Face they could call themſelves Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ſince I was told they denied the fundamental Articles of the Holy Faith, to which I ever bore the higheſt Veneration and Eſteem; and notwithſtanding I had always lived at the greateſt Diſtance from that People, and was very zealous in the worſhip of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and upon all Occaſions would

ſpeak very honourably of it, moreover was content to ſuffer ſome few Inconveniences upon that Account, (as thou very well knoweſt) yet my Father ſtill look'd upon me as inclining to the <hi>Quakers;</hi> and ſome Years ago ſignified to a Friend, he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid I would become an Enthuſiaſt; and whilſt I was at <hi>Bungan</hi> School he ſent me two Books to read that were writ againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> one of which was <hi>John Faldo's,</hi> who hath been ſufficiently expoſed for it by <hi>William Penn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt I lived in <hi>London</hi> in that private retired Manner (I was juſt now ſpeaking of) walking very humbly in the Sight of God, and having Opportunity to reflect upon my paſt Life, as I had Occaſion to be one Day at a Book-ſeller's Shop, I happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to caſt my Eye on <hi>Barclay's</hi> Works; and having heard in the Country, that he was a Man of great Account among the <hi>Quakers,</hi> I had a mind to ſee what their Principles were, and what Defence they could make for themſelves; for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

I took Barclay home with me, and I read him through in a Week's Time, ſave a little Treatiſe at the End, which I found to be very philoſophical, I omitted; but however, I ſoon read enough to convince me of my own Blindneſs and Ignorance in the Things of God; there I found a Light to break in upon my mind, which did mightily refreſh and comfort me in that poor, low, and humble ſtate in which I then was; for indeed I was then, and had been ſo for a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Time before, very hungry and thirſty after Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and therefore I received the Truth with all Readineſs of mind; 'twas like Balm to my Soul, and as Showers of Rain to the thirſty Earth which is parched with Heat and Drought.</p>
               <p>This Author laid things down ſo plainly, and proved them with ſuch Ingenuity and Dexterity of Learning, and opened the Scriptures ſo clearly to me, that without ſtanding to cavil, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, raiſe Argument or Objection; or conſulting with Fleſh and Blood, I preſently reſigned myſelf to God, and weeping

for Joy that I had found ſo great a Treaſure, I often thanked him with Tears in my eyes for ſo kind a Viſitation of his Love, that he was graciouſly pleaſed to look towards me when my Soul cried after him; ſo, that tho' before I was in great Doubt and Trouble of mind, not knowing which Way to determine myſelf, yet now the Sun breaking out ſo powerfully upon me, the Clouds were ſcattered: I was now fully ſatisfied in my own Mind which Way I ought to go, and to what Body of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I ſhould join myſelf. So I immediately left the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> and went to <hi>Gracious-ſtreet</hi> Meeting. After I had read <hi>Barclay,</hi> I read ſome other Books of that Kind, among which was an excellent Piece, tho' in a ſmall Volume, called, <hi>No Croſs, No Crown:</hi> Thus I continued reading and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting Meetings for ſeveral Weeks together, but did not let any one Soul know what I was about: The firſt Man I converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with was <hi>G. Whitehead,</hi> and this was ſeveral Weeks after I began to read <hi>Barclay,</hi> and frequent their Meetings; By him I was introduced into more Acquaintance, and ſtill the farther I went the more I liked their Plainneſs, and the Decency and Simplicity of their Converſation: They do not uſe the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Salutations of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but ſhake hands freely and converſe together as Brothers and Siſters that are ſprung of the ſame Royal ſeed, and made Kings and Prieſts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God. O, the Love, the Sweetneſs and tenderneſs of affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have ſeen among this people! <hi>By this</hi> ſays Chriſt, <hi>ſhall all men know that ye are my diſciples, if ye have love one to another.</hi> John xiii. 35. <hi>Put on therefore,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, (<hi>as the Elect of God holy and beloved) bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering,</hi> Col. iii. 12.</p>
               <p>Thus, my dear friend, I have given thee an account of my proceedings on this affair. As to my bodily ſtate, if thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireſt to know what it is, I may acquaint thee that I have my health as well as ever, and I bleſs God I have food and raiment ſufficient for me, ſo that I want no outward thing; and I have the neceſſities and conveniencies of life liberally. Let us not burthen ourſelves with taking care for the vanities and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities

of it; let us <hi>poſſeſs our veſſels in ſanctification and honour.</hi> 1. <hi>Theſ.</hi> iv. 4. And as we bring our minds into perfect ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the whole will of God, ſo let us bring our body to the moſt ſimple and natural way of living, being content with the feweſt Things, never ſtudying to gratify our wanton Appetites, nor to follow the Cuſtoms and Humours of men, but how we may ſo contract our earthly Cares and Pleaſures, that we may bring moſt Glory to God, moſt Health and Peace to our own Souls, and do moſt Service to the Truth; and if this be our Aim, certainly a very ſmall portion of the Things of this World will ſuffice us: Seeing we are Chriſtians, we ſhould therefore earneſtly purſue thoſe Things which bring us neareſt to God, and which are moſt perfective of human Nature; for what is more than a Competency ſeems to be a Burden to a generous philoſophical Soul, which would breathe in a pure Vehicle, that ſo it may have a quick Senſe and Reliſh of all Bleſſings, both of the ſuperior and inferior Worlds.</p>
               <p>Thou knoweſt, my dear Friend, that Religion is a very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Thing, and Repentance is a great Work, and one preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous immortal Soul is of more worth, than ten thouſand periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Worlds, with all their Pomp and Glory: Therefore let us take Courage, and be valiant for the Truth upon the Earth, let us not content ourſelves with a Name and Profeſſion of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, let us come to the Life and Power of it; let us not deſpond of getting the Victory; we have a little Strength for God; let us be faithful to him and he will give us more Strength, ſo that we ſhall ſee the Enemy of our Peace fall before us, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall be impoſſible unto us: I ſay, my Friend, let us be faithful to that Meaſure of Light and Knowledge which God has given us, to be profited and edified by it in a ſpiritual Life, and as God ſees we are diligent and faithful to work with the Strength we have, he will more and more enlighten us, ſo that we ſhall ſee to the End of thoſe Forms and Shadows of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wherein we have formerly lived; but if he ſees we are about to take up our Reſt in thoſe Shadows, that we grow cold and indifferent in the purſuit of Holineſs, running out into Notions and Speculations, and have more mind to diſpute; and to make
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:035518_0088_10055BE741FB8D98"/>
a Shew of Learning and Subtility, than to lead a holy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Life, then 'tis juſt with God to leave us in a carnal and polluted State, to continue yet but in the outward Court, where we may pleaſe ourſelves with beholding the Beauty and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a worldly Sanctuary, and never witneſs the vail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken away, and that we are brought by the Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus into the Holieſt of all, where alone there is true Peace with God, and Reſt to the weary Soul. I could ſay much more up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Head, if Time or Leiſure would give Leave.</p>
               <p>As for a particular Anſwer to thy Letter, I have not Time now to give it; and for the preſent let this general Anſwer ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: and if thou wilt conſider Things in their pure abſtracted Nature, and not ſuffer the Prejudices of Education to ſway thee, but in Fear and Humility wilt ſearch out the Truth for thyſelf, thou wilt find that there needs no other Anſwer to thy Letter than what I have already given; for by waiting on God, and deligently ſeeking him, thou wilt find Anſwer to it in thy own Boſom, and this will be much more full, clear, and ſatisfactory than I, or any other Man living can pretend to give thee, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Friend who hath lovingly wrote to me, for whom I deſire, with all the ſincere-hearted in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that they may come to witneſs the Almighty Power of God, to ſave and redeem them from every Yoke; and that they may ſee clearly to the End of thoſe Things which are aboliſhed, and come to the Enjoyment of ſpiritual and heavenly Things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, is the daily Prayer and deep Travil of my Soul, God knoweth.

               <p>I LATELY received a kind and brotherly Letter from thee, for which I return thee many Thanks. I am now in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of the People called <hi>Quakers;</hi> and I have Cauſe to bleſs God for this happy Change of my Life: I am thro' Mercy brought off from the Shadow of Religion, and am preſſing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to get Acquaintance with the quickening Power, Life and Virtue of it, if that I may be a Chriſtian indeed, and not in Name and Profeſſion only. I had a threat while talk'd and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd of Holineſs, but did not underſtand what it was to talk with God, to live and dwell in him. Perhaps indeed ſome may think I made a fair Shew of Piety when I was with you. But alas! I was deeply ſenſible of my own Faults and Miſcarriages and I reſolved thro' God's Aſſiſtance to enquire after ſomething more Noble and Excellent than I had diſcovered in that State; and bleſſed be his Name for ever, that God hath anſwered the Cry of my Soul, and let me ſee a People that are hated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by the World, but are dear to him; for he hath revealed to them the Myſteries of the Kingdom; he hath carried them upon Eagles Wings, and cheriſhed them as the Apple of his Eye. As for me, I have been yet but in the outward Court; and far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> of that Truth and Righteouſneſs that is taught and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed among this People: For they are come within the Holieſt of all, they are come into a near Communion with God, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the Cherubims of Glory that cover the Mercy-Seat, to be fed with the true Manna. Theſe are Myſteries that are to be revealed unto the Meek and Lowly, but the Haughty, Inſolent and Prophane, cannot come near them, nor taſte of the Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor Comfort of them. Indeed the formal traditional ſort of People of the World, may talk of theſe Things as they have heard from others, and in their ſober minutes may have ſome faint Glimmerings that Way; but to come to a real and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Enjoyment of them, they can no more pretend to, than to work the greateſt Impoſſibilities; all their Wit and Subtility, and Learning cannot reach higher for to handle of the Word of

Life; this is peculiar only to thoſe who are content to forſake all, and become Fools for Chriſt, they are thoſe who are in a good Temper to receive and co-operate with the influence of the Holy Spirit, and have ſeen the Emptineſs and Vanity of all thoſe Things that are ſo much admired by the World; the Schools, and Univerſities, and Learned Doctors, and Great Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, have not profitted me; they are ravened from the Spirit of God, and gone out into their own Notions and Speculations, thinking thereby to ſearch out God and comprehend the Truth. Alas! the Myſteries of God's Kingdom are far out of their Reach in their carnal minds; they weary themſelves in vain; the Vulture's Eye cannot pierce into theſe Secrets; all the great Critick Scholars and Philoſophers of the World are Fools in theſe things, and whilſt they are wearying themſelves to find the deep Things of our God, ſtudying and racking their Heads, toſſing and tumbling to and fro like a wild Bull in a Net, and knows not which Way to diſentangle himſelf; the more he ſtruggles, the weaker he grows, the faſter he is bound; ſo the more theſe vain Talkers read the more they write; the more they cavil and diſpute, the further they are from God, and the more they declare their Hatred and Enmity to the Spirit of Chriſt, and to the Simplicity of the Goſpel. I have been a long time aware of the Folly and Impertinency of theſe Men, and chiefly the celebrated Fathers of the Church, as they call them; the Councils and Synods of Old, are now of very ſmall Account with me; I am not aſhamed to ſit under the Teachings of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Mechanicks, howſoever they may ſeem in the Eye of the World; for they teach me more Chriſtianity, and inſtruct me more perfectly in a divine Life, than all the ſtudied elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated Sermons and Diſcourſes that ever I heard at the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, or ſince; their Words are with Power, they are mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſiſted with the Spirit of God, they ſpeak with Majeſty and Authority, and there is a native Beauty, Clearneſs and Solidity of Expreſſion that ſhines thro' their Diſcourſes, which is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to anſwer that groundleſs Calumny, viz, <hi>The Quakers

Preaching is Nonſenſe, and no Body could underſtand them.</hi> This I have heard often refuted by many living Teſtimonies, ſo that I do rather think them the beſt Wits, and the moſt ingenious Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the World; for they employ their Parts and Learning in the Fear of God to his Glory and Service, and to promote the trueſt Intereſt of Mankind. As for the little Jeſts, Witneſſes, and vain Pedantry of the Age, which I know the World hath Eſteem for, and nothing will pleaſe but what abounds with ſuch Fooleries. I ſay, if the <hi>Quakers</hi> be deficient in any of theſe, it is not for want of Abilities, or becauſe they have leſs Wit than other Men, but becauſe they have more Prudence and Wiſdom to govern it, and that is the Reaſon why they avoid ſuch child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Vanities, which are ſo freely uſed and indulged by others, to the great Diſhonour of God and the Chriſtian Religion; and therefore becauſe they do not ſeek to pleaſe a wanton Age, to make people laugh and be merry, nor to entertain the carnal airy Mind with pleaſant Stories, fine Notions, and witty Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of natural Things; from thence it is that they have been ſhamefully traduced by the World, as the moſt ignorant, blind and fooliſh People that ever made any Profeſſion of Religion, and yet this is the People to whom I have now joined myſelf in a ſincere Love to Truth, God knoweth; and I glory more in this Fellowſhip and Acquaintance with theſe Lambs of Chriſt, than if I were related to the greateſt Kings, Lords and Potentates upon the Earth. Oftentimes hath my Spirit been refreſhed with theirs, when we have met together to wait upon God; and my Soul ſtill longs and pants more and more to be filled with theſe divine Comforts: he is ready always to pour down Bleſſings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, if we could qualify ourſelves for the Reception of them; If we would put away vain Thoughts, which cloud and darken the Mind, and ſo hinders the Favourable Influence and Iradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Heaven.</p>
               <p>And ſince it hath pleaſed God to viſit me of late, and to make known to me Excellent Things in Righteouſneſs, he alone is to have the Praiſe and Glory of all, and now I freely reſign myſelf to the Conduct of the bleſſed Spirit; now let the Truth proſper, now let it run and be glorified in the Earth, let it ſhine out in

its full Luſture, to the Terror and Confuſion of all the Enemies thereof, and to the reviving of the Souls of the Hungry and Thirſty, who are ready to faint, waiting for and expecting the Conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> until the Times of Refreſhment comes from the Preſence of the Lord, who will open a Fountain for <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſo that Rivers ſhall run in dry Places: There will he ſpeak Peace to his People, and after they have ſat ſilent a little While in the Duſt, ſuffering patiently the chaſtiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Rod of his Love to paſs over them, he ſhall then comfort the Daughter of <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Ariſe thou afflicted, and weep and mourn no more, but put on thy beautiful Garments.</hi> Oh! <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> raiſe thy Head, uncover thy Face, and gird up thy Loins with Strength, ſee the Day break, and the Morning ſpread itſelf upon the Mountains; now the ſorrowful Nights of Affliction are gone over, the Clouds are ſcatter'd and gone, the Sun is riſen in its Brightneſs, and now Joy and Peace ſhall be multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; in a little Wrath I hid my Face from thee for a Moment, but with everlaſting Kindneſs will I have Mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer. Oh! let us wait in Humility of Soul, and tenderneſs of Heart, before the Lord, that we may witneſs this great Change and Salvation wrought in us and for us, that the Scripture may be no more a ſealed Book to us, but that we may feel the precious Truths therein recorded to be fulfilled, in our own Particulars. Then there we ſhall never be weary of praying, and reading the holy Scriptures, we ſhall never be loath or unwilling to come into God's Preſence; for his Love, &amp; the ſweetneſs of his Ointment, will draw &amp; allure us to dwell always under his Canopy, that we may feel Life and Power to flow from Him who is the Ocean that ſupplies all the Wants of the Children of Men; and how ſhall we come to taſte of that heavenly Banquet he hath prepared for us, that we may eat and drink at his Table, and that our Souls may delight in Fatneſs? I ſay, how ſhall we attain to this, but by a ſtrict and mortified Life? Certainly the more we retire from worldly Joys, and empty ourſelves of earthly Comforts and falſe Delights, the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter we ſhall be to receive thoſe that are ſpiritual and heavenly; and not only to receive and rejoice in them for a Time, but to
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:035518_0093_10055BF1F3477CB8"/>
live and dwell in them for ever, for this is the Life of Jeſus and here the Kingdom of God reigns in the Heart and Soul, by which it is changed from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord. And now I would aſk all the wiſe and prudent, all the rich, all the noble and learned Men of the World, what they think of theſe Things? Whether this is to be learned in their Courts and Palaces? Or whether any of the great Scholars and Univerſities in Chriſtendom can furniſh us with ſuch a Syſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of Divinity as this? No, they hate it, and deſpiſe it, and inſtead of a ſober Anſwer to my Query, they return Scoffs and Contempt. This is Canting they ſay, and an idle Dream, and forged Chimera of my own Brain, and a great many more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious Names they have for ſuch Enquiries as theſe. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, perhaps, they will ſuffer the Expreſſion, with an hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Shew, will pretend to pity me, calling it an unhappy Effect of Melancholy, and too much Retirement from the World; and this they think too much Condeſenſion, that I ought to think myſelf beholding to them for giving it ſo mild a Character; for at other Times they deal more ſharply, and ſay confidently that it is Madneſs, Deluſion, Witchcraft, and diabolical Enthuſiaſm.</p>
               <p>But I am content to lie under all theſe odious Imputations from the World, knowing very well that better Men than <hi>I,</hi> have ſuffer'd the ſame Things before me, and do, at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Time. As for my Enemies, I can truly ſay, I thank God I pity them, and pray for them; they do not hurt me, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. And now, my dear Friend, before I conclude, ſuffer me a little to ſpeak of thy preſent Circumſtances; for, as God knoweth, my Bowels yearns towards thee in the tender Love of Jeſus. I ſuppoſe thou art now where I left thee, <hi>viz.</hi> with the Lord <hi>Richardſon,</hi> ſo called, in the Capacity of a Chaplain, an Office which I havv had a little Experience of myſelf, ſince I laſt ſaw thee; but was quickly ſo weary of that ſervile Yoke, ſo unworthy of that holy Function I bore, that in ten Days Time I quitted my new Preferment, and left it more freely than ever I undertook it. What Peace or ſatisfaction thou canſt have in ſuch Employment I know not; for my Part, I could find none;

my Soul was grieved and burthen'd every Day with ſeeing and hearing their evil Deeds, beholding their Vanities and Exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; this was a ſword to my Soul and ſpirit, it wounded me very deep; and I do ſolemnly profeſs, I had rather beg my bread from Door to Door, than to live in the like Bondage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, where I muſt be obliged to ſuch Ceremonies and Forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, to flatter Men in their Sins, to cry Peace, peace; and to ſow Pillows under the arm-holes of delicate people, that can never bear the leaſt Check or Frown, but expect the mercenary Prieſt ſhould always laugh or ſmile in their Faces, even when he ſees plainly they are going to Hell and Deſtruction; and yet I muſt tell thee, the Family I was in, was looked upon as one of the moſt ſober and regular, as the World goes now; and I muſt needs ſay, I did not leave them for any Drinking, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, Swearing or Whoring that I preceived amongſt them; in all theſe filthy ſcandalous Practices, as far as I could ſee, they were blameleſs; but yet I ſaw their Hearts were not right; for they were Lovers of pleaſures, more than Lovers of God; and thou knoweſt that he or they, let them be great or ſmall, if they live in Pleaſure, grow fat and wanton againſt Chriſt; ſuch Perſons are dead while they live: I ſay, whatever their Faith, or Principles, or Profeſſions may be, yet in Religion they are dead.</p>

               <p>THERE is nothing more capable of letting us into the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of human miſery, than an inquiry after the real cauſe of that perpetual hurry and confuſion, in which we paſs our lives. The ſoul is ſent into the body, to be ſojourner of a few days.

She knows this is but a ſtop, till ſhe may embark for eternity; and that a ſmall ſpace is allowed her to prepare for the voyage. The main part of this ſpace is raviſhed from her by the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities of nature, and but a ſlender pittance left to her own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal: and yet, this moment that remains, does ſo ſtrangely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and perplex her, that ſhe only ſtudies how to loſe it. She feels an intolerable burden, in being obliged to live with herſelf, and think of herſelf; and, therefore, her principal care is to forget herſelf, and to let this ſhort and precious moment paſs away without reflection, by being amuſed with things that prevent her notice of its ſpeed. This is the ground of all the tumultuary buſineſs, of all the trifling diverſions amongſt men; in which our general aim is to make the time paſs off our hands, without feeling it, or rather without feeling our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and, by getting rid of this ſmall portion of life, to avoid that inward diſguſt and bitterneſs, which we ſhould not fail to meet with, if we found leiſure to deſcend into our own breaſts.</p>
               <p>We imagine that, at leaſt, ſome reſpite, ſome ſhelter, may be found, by agreeing to baniſh them from our meditation. This is the only natural comfort which mankind have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to invent under their numerous calamities. But a moſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable comfort it proves; becauſe it does not tend to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of theſe evils, but only to the concealment of them for a ſhort ſeaſon; and becauſe, in thus concealing them it hinders us from applying ſuch proper means as would remove them. Thus, by a ſtrange revolution in the nature of man, that grief and inward diſquiet which he dreads as the greateſt of ſenſible e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, is, in one reſpect, his greateſt good; becauſe it might contribute, more than all things beſides, to the putting of him in a ſucceſsful method of recovery. On the other hand, his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions, which he ſeems to prize as his ſovereign good, are, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed his greateſt evil; becauſe they are of all things the moſt effctually in making him negligent under his diſtemper: they do but amuſe and beguile him; and, in the concluſion, lead him down blindfold into the grave. It is, indeed, one of the miracles

of Chriſtianity, that, by reconciling man to God, it reſtores him to his own good opinion; that it makes him able to bear the ſight of himſelf; and, in ſome caſes, renders ſolitude and ſilence more agreeable than all the intercourſe and action of mankind. Nor is it by fixing man in his own perſon, that theſe wonderful effects are produced; it is by carrying him to God, and by ſupporting him under the ſenſe of his miſeries, with the hopes of an aſſured and complete deliverance in a better life.</p>

               <p>"THE call which men have for diverſion, is not by far ſo great as is thought, and it conſiſts more in imagination or in cuſtom, than in real neceſſity. Thoſe who are employed in bodily labour, have only need of a bare ceſſation from it. Thoſe who are employed in affairs toilſome to the mind, and but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle laborious to the body, have only need to recollect themſelves from that diſpoſition which thoſe ſort of employments naturally cauſe, and not to diſſipate themſelves yet more, by diverſions which extremely engage the mind. It is a jeſt to fancy that one has need to paſs three hours in filling the mind with follies at a play. Thoſe who find in themſelves this need, ought to look on it, not as a natural weakneſs, but as a vice of cuſtom, which they muſt cure by ſerious employment."</p>
               <p>"If the ſoul abandon itſelf to falſe pleaſures, it loſes the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh of ſpiritual ones, and finds nothing but diſguſt for <hi>God.</hi> When one feeds himſelf with the vain pleaſures of the world, the ſpiritual ſenſes become ſtupified, and incapable of reliſhing or underſtanding, the things of God.—Now, among the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the world, which extinguiſh the love of <hi>God,</hi> it may be ſaid that plays and romances hold the firſt rank; becauſe there is nothing more oppoſed to truth; and the Spirit of God, being a Spirit of truth, can have no part with the vanities of the world."</p>
               <p>"Plays and romances not only indiſpoſe the ſoul for all acts of religion and piety, but they give it a diſguſt, in ſome meaſure, to all ſerious and ordinary actions. As nothing is repreſented

in them but galantries, or extraordinary adventures, and the diſcourſes are far diſtant from ſuch as are uſed in ſerious affairs, one inſenſibly takes from them a romantic diſpoſition of mind: the head is filled with heroes; and heroines; and women, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the adorations which, in them are given to their ſex, have that ſort of life ſo much impreſſed on their minds, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of their family and of common life, become inſupportable to them; and when they return to their houſes, with minds thus evaporated and filled with theſe follies, they find every thing there diſagreeable, and eſpecially their huſbands, who, being taken up with their affairs, are not always in the humour of paying them thoſe ridiculous complaiſances which are given to women in plays, in romances, and in the romantic life."</p>
               <p>"Thoſe deceive themſelves extremely, who think that plays make no ill impreſſion on them, becauſe they do not find them excite any formed evil deſire. There are many degrees before one comes to an entire corruption of mind; and it is always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely hurtful to the ſoul, to deſtroy the ramparts which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured it from temptation."</p>
               <p>"One does not begin to fall when the fall becomes ſenſible; the fallings of the ſoul are ſlow, they have preparations and progreſſions; and it often happens, that we are overcome by temptations, only by our having weakened ourſelves in occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which ſeemed of no importance: it being certain, that he who deſpiſes little things, ſhall fall by little and little."</p>
               <p>"It muſt not be imagined that the wicked maxims of which plays are full, are not hurtful, becauſe people do not go there to form their ſentiments, but to divert themſelves: for they do not fail of making impreſſions, notwithſtanding, without being perceived.—For inſtance, the opinion that the chimera of honour is ſo great a good, that it muſt be preſerved, even at the expence of life, is what produces the brutal rage of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of France. If thoſe who fight a duel were ever ſpoken of but as fools and madmen—as indeed they are; if that phantom

Now, it cannot be denied that plays, which are full of theſe evil maxims, do greatly contribute to fortify that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; becauſe the mind being by them tranſported, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely out of itſelf inſtead of correcting thoſe ſentiments abandons itſelf to them without reſiſtence and delighst to feel the motions they inſpire, which diſpoſe it to produce the like upon occaſion."—"God does not impute to us the coldneſs which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the withdrawing of his light, or merely from the heavineſs of this body; but, no doubt, he imputes to us that to which we have contributed by our negligence, and our vain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions. It is his will that we ſhould eſteem nothing ſo much as the gracious gift which he has made us of his love; and that we ſhould be careful to preſerve it by giving it nouriſhment. This command he has intimated to us in the perſons of the prieſts in the ancient law, whom he ordains always to maintain the fire on the altar, and to take care to put wood upon it eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day in the morning. This altar is the heart of man, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Chriſtian is the prieſt; who ought to be careful to nouriſh the fire of charity on the altar of his heart, by putting wood e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day upon it; that is to ſay, maintaining it by the medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of divine things, and by exerciſes of piety. Now, if thoſe who go to plays have yet any ſenſe of piety, they cannot diſown that plays deaden, and tend to entirely extinguiſh devotion; ſo that they ſhould not doubt, God judges them extremely guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, for having made ſo little account of his love, that inſtead of nouriſhing and endeavouring to augment it, they have not feared to extinguiſh it by their vain diverſions; and that he will impute to them as a great ſin, the abatement or the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>It becomes us then, as rational beings, as Chriſtians, who are called to renounce the vanities of this tranſient precarious ſtate, and who have a permanent and better world in view, to aſſert the dignity of our nature, and to act conformably to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of our deſtination.

               <p>May thoſe perſons, therefore, who have doubts reſpecting propriety of indulging themſelves in theatrical amuſements, and, indeed, may all who read theſe lines, ſeriouſly conſider the hazard of ſuch indulgences and give the ſubject that attention which its importance demand.

               <p>"This is true religion, which is the perfection of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the joy and delight of every one that feels it active and ſtrong within him. It is true this is not arrived at, all at once, and it will have an unhappy alloy, hanging long even about a good man; but, as thoſe ill mixtures are the perpetual grief of his ſoul, ſo that it is his chief care to watch over, and mortify them, he will be in a continual progreſs, ſtill gaining ground upon himſelf: and as he attains to a degree of purity, he will find a flame of life and joy growing up in him. Of this I write with a greater concern and emotion, becauſe I have felt this the true, and indeed, the only joy which runs through a man's heart and life. It is that which hath been, for many years my greateſt ſupport. I rejoice daily in it, I feel from it the earneſt of that ſupreme joy which I want &amp; long for; and I am ſure there is nothing elſe which can afford any true and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete happineſs."</p>
