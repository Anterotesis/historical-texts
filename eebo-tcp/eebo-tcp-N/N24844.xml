            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IN Europe, dedications have their price; and the author oftener looks to the plenitude of the pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, than the brains of his patron.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>ONE of the firſt obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the author of the following ſheets made, upon his return to his native country, after an abſence of ſeven years, was the extreme avidity, with which books of mere amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were purchaſed and peruſed by all ranks of his countrymen. When he left New England, books of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ography, Travels, Novels, and mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:032945_0005_0FF5E96A7A128420"/>
Romances, were confined to our ſea ports; or, if known in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, were read only in the families of Clergymen, Phyſicians, and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers: while certain funeral diſcourſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, the laſt words and dying ſpeeches of Bryan Shaheen, and Levi Ames, and ſome dreary ſomebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's Day of Doom, formed the moſt diverting part of the farmer's library. On his return from captivity, he found a ſurpriſing alteration in the public taſte. In our inland towns of conſequence, ſocial libraries had been inſtituted, compoſed of books, deſigned to amuſe rather than to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct;
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:032945_0006_0FF5E9914ACF7C90"/>
and country bookſellers, foſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the new born taſte of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, had filled the whole land with modern Travels, and Novels almoſt as incredible. The diffuſion of a taſte, for any ſpecies of writing, through all ranks, in ſo ſhort a time, would appear impracticable to a European. The peaſant of Europe muſt firſt be taught to read, before he can acquire a taſte in letters. In New England, the work is half completed. In no other country are there ſo many people, in proportion to its numbers, who can read and write; and therefore,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:032945_0007_0FF5E96C89A2ACC0"/>
no ſooner was a taſte for amuſing literature diffuſed than all orders of country life, with one accord, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook the ſober ſermons and Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Pieties of their fathers, for the gay ſtories and ſplendid impieties of the Traveller and the Noveliſt. The worthy farmer no longer fatigued himſelf with Bunyan's Pilgrim up the "hill of difficulty" or through the "ſlough of deſpond;" but quaff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wine with Brydone in the her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitage of Veſuvius, or ſported with Bruce on the fairy land of Abyſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia: while Dolly, the diary maid, and Jonathan, the hired man, threw a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:032945_0008_0FF5E99352F42088"/>
the ballad of the cruel ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, over which they had ſo oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en wept in concert, and now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed themſelves into ſo agreeable a terrour, with the haunted houſes and hobgobblins of Mrs. Ratcliffe, that they were both afraid to ſleep a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
                  <p>While this love of literature, however frivolous, is pleaſing to the man of letters, there are two things to be deplored. The firſt is that, while ſo many books are vended, they are not of our own manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If our wives and daughters
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:032945_0009_0FF5E970986F9D80"/>
will wear gauze and ribbands, it is a pity, they are not wrought in our own looms. The ſecond miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune is that Novels, being the picture of the times, the New En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland reader is inſenſibly taught to admire the levity, and often the vices of the parent country. While the fancy is enchanted, the heart is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. The farmer's daughter, while ſhe pities the misfortune of ſome modern heroine, is expoſed to the attacks of vice, from which her ignorance would have formed her ſureſt ſhield. If the Engliſh Nov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el does not inculcate vice, it at
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:032945_0010_0FF5E96E0ECB6E08"/>
leaſt impreſſes on the young mind an erroneous idea of the world, in which ſhe is to live. It paints the manners, cuſtoms, and habits of a ſtrange country; excites a fondneſs for falſe ſplendour; and renders the homeſpun habits of her own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try diſguſting.</p>
                  <p>There are two things wanted, ſaid a friend to the author: that we write our own books of amuſement, and that they exhibit our own man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Why then do you not write the hiſtory of your own life? The first part of it, if not highly intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:032945_0011_0FF5E9729AF21DF8"/>
would at leaſt diſplay a portrait of New England manners, hitherto unattempted. Your captivity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Algerines, with ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the manners of that fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious race, ſo dreaded by commercial powers, and ſo little known in our country, would be intereſting; and I ſee no advantage the Novel writer can have over you, unleſs your read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould be of the ſentiment of the young lady, mentioned by Addiſon in his ſpectator, who, he informs us, borrowed Plutarch's lives; and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter reading the firſt volume, with infinite delight, ſuppoſing it to be a
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:032945_0012_0FF5E994D7ABB140"/>
Novel, threw aſide the others with diſguſt, becauſe a man of letters had inadvertently told her, the work was founded on FACT.</p>

                        <p>The Author giveth an Account of his gallant Anceſtor, Captain John Underhill, his Arrival in Maſſachuſetts, and Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the firſt Settlers.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I DERIVE my birth from one of the firſt emigrants to New England, being lineally deſcended from Captain John Underhill, who came into the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032945_0023_0FF5E9D46EA62380"/>
in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and thirty; of whom honourable mention is made by that elegant, accurate, and intereſting hiſtorian, the Reverend Jeremy Belknap, in his Hiſtory of New Hampſhire.</p>
                     <p>My honoured anceſtor had early im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed an ardent love of liberty, civil and religious, by his ſervice as a ſoldier among the Dutch, in their glorious and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtruggle for freedom, with Philip the ſecond of Spain; when, though quite a youth, he held a commiſſion in the Earl of Leiceſter's own troop of guards, who was then ſent to the aſſiſtance of that brave people, by the renowned Queen Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth of England.</p>
                     <p>The extravagant paſſion, which that princeſs was ſuppoſed to entertain for va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious male favourites, which occaſioned the diſgrace of one, and the prema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture death of another, while it has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed a darling theme to the noveliſt, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032945_0024_0FF5E9A384432BD8"/>
has been wept over in the tragic ſcene, has never yet received the ſober ſanction of the hiſtorian.</p>
                     <p>A traditional family anecdote, while it places the affection of the queen for Leiceſter beyond doubt, may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing to the learned reader, and may benefit the Engliſh hiſtoriographer.</p>
                     <p>It is well known that this crafty queen, though repeatedly ſolicited, never effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly aſſiſted the Netherlanders, until their affairs were apparently at the loweſt ebb, and they in ſuch deſperate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, as to offer the ſovereignty of their country to her general, the Earl of Leiceſter. Captain Underhill carried the diſpatches to England, and delivered them at the office of Lord Burleigh. The ſame evening, the queen ſent for the captain, and, with apparent perturbation, inquired of him, if he was the meſſenger from Leiceſter, and whether he had any private diſpatches for her. He replied, that he
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032945_0025_0FF5E9D5F4793A40"/>
had delivered all his letters to the ſecreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſtate. She appeared much diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and, after muſing ſome time, ſaid, "So Leiceſter wants to be a king." Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhill, who was in the general's confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, replied that the Dutch had indeed made the offer of the ſovereignty of their country to her general—eſteeming it a great honour, as they ſaid, to have a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of her grace for their ſovereign. No, replied the queen, it is not the Dutch; they hate kings and their divine right; it is the proud Leiceſter, who yearns to be independent of his own ſovereign, who moves this inſolent propoſal. Tell him, from me, that he muſt learn to obey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is fit to govern. Tell him, added the queen, ſoftening her voice, that obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence may make him a <hi>king indeed.</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Captain Underhill had taken the public diſpatches, the queen ſent for him to her privy cloſet, recalled her verbal meſſage, delivered him a letter for
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032945_0026_0FF5E9A509363338"/>
Leiceſter, directed with her own hand, and a purſe of one hundred crowns for himſelf; charging him to encloſe the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in lead, ſink it in caſe of danger in his paſſage by ſea, and to deliver it privately. On the receipt of this letter, Leiceſter was violently agitated, walked his chamber the whole of the enſuing night. Soon after, he reſigned his command, and returned to England, animated by the brighteſt hopes of realizing the lofty ſuggeſtions of his ambition. With him Captain Underhill returned, and upon the deceaſe of the Earl of Leiceſter, attached himſelf to the fortunes of the Earl of Eſſex, the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſucceſſour to Leiceſter in the queen's favour. He accompanied that gallant nobleman in his ſucceſsful attack upon Cadiz, and ſhared his ill fortune in his fruitleſs expedition againſt Tyronne, the rebel chief of the revolted clans of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; and, returning with the Earl into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, by his attachment to that imprudent
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032945_0027_0FF5E9D78F3320E8"/>
nobleman, ſallying into the ſtreets of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the petty inſurrection, which coſt Eſſex his head, he was obliged to ſeek ſafety in Holland, until the acceſſion of King James, in one thouſand ſix hundred and three, when he applied for pardon and leave to return to his native country. But that monarch entertained ſuch an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted idea of the dignity of kings, and from policy, affected ſo great a veneration for the memory of his predeceſſor, that no intereſt of his friends could procure his pardon for an offence, which, in this day and country, would be conſidered a ſimple rout or riot, and puniſhed with a ſmall ſine, in that age of kingly glory was ſuppoſed to combine treaſon and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy: treaſon againſt the queen in her political capacity, and blaſphemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt her as God's repreſentative and vicegerent on earth.</p>
                     <p>The Reverend Mr. Robinſon, with a number of other pious puritans, having
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:032945_0028_0FF5E9A712356080"/>
ſled, from the perſecuting fury of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh prelates, to Holland, in one thouſand ſix hundred and three, he dwelt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muned with them a number of years. He was ſtrongly ſolicited to go with Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Carver, Elder Brewſter, and the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er worthies, part of Mr. Robinſon's church, to the ſettlement of Plymouth, and had partly engaged with them, as their chief military officer; but, Captain Miles Standiſh, his brave fellow ſoldier in the low countries, undertaking the buſineſs, he declined.</p>
                     <p>How he joined Governour Winthrop, does not appear, but he came over to New England with him, and ſoon after we find him diſciplining the Boſton militia, where he was held in ſuch high eſtimation that he was choſen to repreſent that town in the general court; but, his ideas of relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious toleration being more liberal than thoſe around him, he loſt his popularity, and was, on the twentieth of November,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032945_0029_0FF5E9DA8904F5C0"/>
one thouſand ſix hundred and thirty ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, diſfranchiſed and eventually baniſhed the juriſdiction of Maſſachuſetts.</p>
                     <p>The writers of thoſe times differ, as to the particular offence for which he was puniſhed. Some ſay that it was for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the antinomian tenets of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Ann Hutchinſon, others that the charge againſt him was for ſaying, <hi>That the government al Boſton were as zealous as the ſcribes and phariſees, and as Paul before his converſion.</hi> The beſt account, I have been able to collect, is, that at the time when the zeal of our worthy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers burned the hotteſt againſt heretics and ſectaries, when good Roger Williams, who ſettled Providence, the pious Wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright, and others, were baniſhed, he, with about ſixty other imprudent perſons, who did not believe in the then popular arguments of fines, impriſonment, diſfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſement, confiſcation, baniſhments, and halters for the converſion of infidels,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032945_0030_0FF5E9A993E761F8"/>
ſuppoſed that the chriſtian faith, which had ſpread ſo wonderfully in its infancy, when the ſword of civil power was drawn againſt it, in that age, ſurrounded by nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous proſelites, needed not the ſame ſword unſheathed in its favour. Theſe miſtaken people ſigned a remonſtrance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the violent proceedings, which were the order of that day. William Aſpinwall and John Coggeſhell, two of the Boſton repreſentatives, who ſigned the remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, were ſent home, and the town or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to chooſe others in their room. Some of the remonſtrants recanted, ſome were fined, ſome were disfranchiſed, and others, among whom was Captain Underhill, were baniſhed.</p>
                     <p>It is ſaid by ſome authors, that he was charged with the heinous crime of adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that he even confeſſed it. The candid American author, above named, has fallen into this error. As I am ſure it muſt have given him pain <hi>to ſpeak evil
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032945_0031_0FF5E9DC94A435D0"/>
even of the dead,</hi> ſo I am certain he will rectify this miſtake in the next edition of his invaluable hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>That author informs us, page forty three of his firſt volume, "That he, Captain Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhill, was privately dealt with, on ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of adultery, which he diſregarded, and therefore on the next ſabbath was queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned for it before the church; but the evidence not being ſufficient to convict him, the church could only admoniſh him."—Page forty five, "He went to Boſton, and in the ſame public manner acknowledged his adultery. But his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion was mixed with ſo many excuſes and extenuations, that it gave no ſatiſfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
                     <p>The unwary reader would perhaps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that actual adultery was intended, as well as expreſſed, in theſe extracts. The Reverend author himſelf did not advert to the idea, that the moral law of Boſton, in one thouſand ſix hundred and thirty ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032945_0032_0FF5E9AB9D475C80"/>
was not ſo lax as the moral law of the ſame place, in one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty four, as explained by the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of its inhabitants. The rigid diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline of our fathers of that era often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrued actions, expreſſions, and ſometimes thoughts, into crimes; which actions in this day, even the moſt preciſe would conſider either innocent, indifferent, or beneath the dignity of official notice. The fact is, that Captain Underhill, ſo far from CONFESSING, was never charged with committing actual ſtatute book a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery. At a certain lecture in Boſton, inſtead of noting the referred texts in his bible, according to the profitable cuſtom of the times, this gallant ſoldier had fixed his eyes ſtedfaſtly, and perhaps inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, upon one Miſtreſs Miriam Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore; who it ſeems was, at that very time, herſelf in the breach of the ſpirit of an exiſting law, which forbad women to appear in public with uncovered arms and nocks,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032945_0033_0FF5E9DE1A16DD10"/>
by appearing at the ſame lecture with a pair of wanton open worked gloves, ſlit at the thumbs and fingers, for the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iency of taking ſnuff; though ſhe was not charged with the latter crime of uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tobacco. It was the ADULTERY OF THE HEART, of which my gallant anceſtor was accuſed, and founded on that text of ſcripture, "Whoſoever looketh on a wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an to luſt after her, hath committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery with her already in his heart."</p>

for coming to that lecture with a pair of wanton open workt gloves, ſlit at the thumbs and fingers, for the purpoſe of tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſnuff; for, as maſter Cotton obſerved, for what end ſhould thoſe vaine open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings be, but for the intent of taken fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſnuff; and he quoted Gregory Naz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ianzen upon good works.—Maſter Peters ſaid, that theſe opennings were Satan's port holes of firy temptatione. Miſtreſs Miriam offerd in excuſe of her vain attire, that ſhe was newle married, and appeared in her bridall arraye. Maſter Peters ſaid, that marriage was the ocaſion that the Devil tooke to caſte his firy darts, and lay his pit falls of temptation, to catche frale fleſh and bloode. She is to be further dealt with for taken ſnuff. How the uſe of the good creature tobaccoe can be an offence I cannot ſee—Oh my beloved, how theſe prowde phariſees labour aboute the minte and cummine. Governour Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp inquired of mee, if I confeſſed the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032945_0038_0FF5E9B1AD260390"/>
matter. I ſaid I wiſhed a coppy of there charge.—Sir Harry Vane ſaid, there was no neede of any coppie, ſeeing I knew I was guiltee. Charges being made out where there was an uncertantie whether the accuſed was guiltie or not, and to lighten the accuſed into the nature of his cryme, here was no need. Maſter Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſaid, did you not look upon miſtreſs Wilbore? I confeſsd that I did. He ſaid then you are verelie guiltie, brother Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derhill. I ſaid nay, I did not look at the woman luſtfully.—Maſter Peters ſaid, why did you not look at ſiſter Newell or ſiſter Upham? <hi>I ſaid, verelie they are not deſyrable women, as to temporale graces.</hi>—Then Hugh Peters and al cryed, it is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, he hath confeſſed, and paſſed to excommunication. I ſayd where is the law by which you condemne me. Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp ſaid, there is a committee to draft laws. Brother Peters are you not on that committee, I am ſure you have maide a law
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032945_0039_0FF5E9E2A28514F8"/>

                     <p>WHEN the ſentence of ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment paſſed on Captain Underhill, he returned to Dover in New Hampſhire,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:032945_0043_0FF5E9E84820FA78"/>
and was elected governour of the Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean ſettlers there; but, notwithſtanding his great ſervice to the people of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, in the Pequod wars, his perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutors in Boſton would not allow him to die in peace. Firſt, by writing injurious letters to thoſe he governed; by threats of their power; and laſtly, by determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Dover was within the juriſdiction of Maſſachuſetts, they forced him to flee to Albany, then poſſeſſed by the Dutch, under the name of Amboyna.</p>
                     <p>The Dutch were highly pleaſed with the Captain, and after Dutchifying his name into Captain Hans Van Vanderhill, they gave him a command of one hundred and twenty men, in their wars with the natives. It is ſaid that he killed one hundred and fifty Indians on Long Iſland, and upwards of three hundred on the Main. The laurels of the famous Colonel Church wither in compariſon. The Dutch granted him fifty thouſand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032945_0044_0FF5E9B74CD074E0"/>
of land, then in their poſſeſſion. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Engliſh, when they took poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of that country for the Duke of York, afterwards James the ſecond, had promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to quiet the claims of the ſettlers; yet Captain Underhill, or his poſterity, have never availed themſelves of the grant.—Mentioning this circumſtance, ſometime ſince in Hartford, ſome gentlemen imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately offered to raiſe a company and purchaſe my right. I candidly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that I was not poſſeſſed of the title, and knew not the particular ſpot where the land lay, and conſequently was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſell land without title or bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. To my ſurpriſe they laughed at my ſcruples, and obſerved that they wanted the land to ſpeculate upon, to <hi>ſell,</hi> and not to <hi>ſettle.</hi> Titles and boundaries, in ſuch caſes, I underſtood, were indifferent matters mere trifles.</p>
                     <p>My brave anceſtor at an advanced age, died in Albany, leaving two ſons; the

                     </argument>
                     <p>I WAS born on the ſixteenth of July, Anno Domini, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty two. My mother, ſome months before my birth, dreamed that ſhe
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:032945_0047_0FF5E9ECCD99B468"/>
was delivered of me; that I was lying in the cradle, that the houſe was beſet by Indians, who broke into the next room, and took me into the fields with them; that, alarmed by their hideous yellings and warhoops, ſhe ran to the window, and ſaw a number of young tawny ſavages, playing at foot ball with my head; while ſeveral ſachems and ſagamores were look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on unconcerned.</p>
                     <p>This dream made a deep impreſſion on my mother. I well recollect, when a boy, her ſtroking my flaxen locks, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her dream, and obſerving with a ſigh to my father, that ſhe was ſure Updike was born to be the ſport of fortune, and that he would one day ſuffer among ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. Dear woman, ſhe had the native Indians in her mind, but never appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended her poor ſon's ſuffering, many years as a ſlave, among barbarians, more cruel than the monſters of our own woods.</p>

The learned reader will ſmile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuouſly, perhaps, upon my mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dreams, in this enlightened age. I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relate facts, and leave the reader to his own comments. My own opinion of dreams I ſhall conceal, perhaps becauſe I am aſhamed to diſcloſe it. I will venture to obſerve that, if we inſpect the ſacred ſcriptures, we ſhall find frequent inſtances, both of direction to duty, and forewarning of future events, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by Providence, through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of dreams. Is not the modern chriſtian equally the care of indulgent Heaven, as the favoured Jew, or the belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed patriarch?</p>
                     <p>Many modern examples, of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boding viſions of the night, may be adduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. William Phipps, a poor journeyman ſhip carpenter, dreamed that he ſhould one day ride in his coach, and live in a grand houſe near Boſton common. Many years afterwards, when he was knighted
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:032945_0049_0FF5E9EE51E30E48"/>
by King William the third, and came from England, governour of Maſſachuſetts Bay, this dream, even as to the ſituation of the grand houſe, was literally and minutely fulfilled. If the inſect infidels of the day doubt this fact, let them conſult, for their edification, the learned Doctor Math<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's Magnalia, where the whole ſtory, at large, is minutely and amply related.—<hi>It was the errour of the times of monkiſh igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to believe every thing. It may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be the errour of the preſent day, to credit nothing.</hi>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN my childhood I was ſent, as is cuſtomary, to a woman's ſchool, in the ſummer, and to a man's, in the winter ſeaſon, and made great progreſs in ſuch learning as my preceptors dealt in. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout my twelfth year, our miniſter, who made it his cuſtom to inſpect the ſchools annually, came to our diſtrict. My maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who looked upon me as his beſt ſchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar,
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:032945_0051_0FF5E9F0576F9A70"/>
directed me to read a leſſon in Dil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's ſpelling book, which I recited as loud as I could ſpeak, without regard to emphaſis or ſtops. This ſo pleaſed our miniſter, who prided himſelf on the ſtrength of his own lungs, that, a ſhort time after, coming to my father's, to <hi>dicker,</hi> as they ſtiled it, about a ſwop of cattle, and not finding my father ſharp at the bargain, he changed the diſcourſe upon me; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving how delighted he was with my performances at ſchool. What a pity it was ſuch a genius was not encouraged. Mr. Underhill, you muſt put Updike to learning. My father pleaded poverty. When I went to Harvard College, replied the miniſter, I was poor indeed. I had no father with a good farm to aſſiſt me; but, with being butler's freſhman, and ringing the bell the firſt year, waiter the three laſt, and keeping ſchool in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, I rubbed through, and am now what I am; and who knows, continued
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:032945_0052_0FF5E9BEE957A610"/>
he, but when Updike has completed his education, he may make a miniſter, and poſſibly, when my uſefulneſs is over, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply our very pulpit.</p>
                     <p>My mother here interfered. She was a little ſpare woman. My father was a large bony man; famous, in his youth, for carrying the ring at wreſtling; and, in his latter years, for his perſeverance at town meetings. But, notwithſtanding my father's ſucceſs in carrying points abroad, my mother, ſome how or other, contrived always to carry them at home. My father never would acknowledge this; but, when a coarſe neighbour would ſometimes ſlily hint the old adage of the gray mare being the better horſe, he would ſay to his particular friends that he always was conqueror in his domeſtic warfare: but would confeſs that he loved quiet, and was of late tired of perpetually getting the victory. My mother joined the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; obſerving that Updike ſhould have
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:032945_0053_0FF5E9F2DC428EE0"/>
learning, though ſhe worked her hands to the bone to procure it. She did not doubt, when he came to preach, he would be as much run after as the great Mr. Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. I always thought, continued ſhe, the child was a genius; and always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he ſhould go to college. The boy loves books. He has read Valentine and Orſon, and Robinſon Cruſoe. I went, the other day, three miles to borrow Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim's Progreſs for him. He has read it through every bit; ay, and underſtands it too. Why, he ſtuck a ſkewer through Apollyon's eye in the picture, to help Chriſtian beat him. My father could not anſwer my mother's argument. The dicker about the oxen was renewed; and it was concluded to ſwop even, though my father's were much the likelier cattle, and that I ſhould go that week and ſtudy Latin with the miniſter, and be fitted for college.</p>
                     <p>With him I ſtudied four years, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring inceſſantly at Greek and Latin:
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:032945_0054_0FF5E9C20600B670"/>
as to Engliſh grammar, my preceptor, knowing nothing of it himſelf, could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate nothing to me. As he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſtically attached to the Greek, and had delivered an oration in that language, at the commencement at Cambridge, when he took his firſt degree, by his direction, I committed to memory above four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the moſt ſonorous lines in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, which I was called to repeat before a number of clergymen, who viſited him at an annual convention, in our pariſh. Theſe gentlemen were ever pleaſed to expreſs aſtoniſhing admiration at my lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary acquirements. One of them prognoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticated that I ſhould be a general, from the fire and force, with which I recited Homer's battles of the Greeks and Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans. Another augered that I ſhould be a member of congreſs, and equal the Adamſes in oratory, from my repeating the ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, at the councils of the heathen gods, with ſuch attention to the caeſura. A
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:032945_0055_0FF5E9F4FA921078"/>
third was ſure that I ſhould become a Witherſpoon in divinity, from the pathos, with which I declaimed Jupiter's ſpeech to all the gods. In fine, theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men conſidered the claſſics the ſource of all valuable knowledge. With them dead languages were more eſtimable than living; and nothing more neceſſary to accompliſh a young man for all, that is profitable and honourable in life, than a profound knowledge of Homer. One of them gravely obſerved that he was ſure General Waſhington read Greek; and that he never would have captured the Heſſians at Trenton, if he had not taken his plan of operation from that of Ulyſſes and Diomede ſeizing the horſes of Rheſus, as deſcribed in the tenth book of the Iliad.</p>

In June, one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty, my father began ſeriouſly to think of ſending me to college. He called upon a neighbour, to whom he had ſold part of his farm, for ſome caſh. His creditor readily paid, the whole ſum due, down in paper money, and my father found, to his ſurprize, that the value of three acres paid him the principal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the whole ſum, for which he had ſold ſeventy five acres of land, five years before. This was ſo ſevere a ſtroke of ill fortune, that it entirely fruſtrated the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſending me to college.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHAT added to the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, mentioned in the laſt chapter, a worthy divine, ſettled in Boſton, paſſing through our town, told my father, in a private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, that all the Greek I had acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was of no other ſervice than fitting me for college. My father was aſtoniſhed. He was a plain unlettered man, of ſtrong natural abilities. Pray, Reverend Sir, ſaid my father, do they not learn this Greek language at college? If ſo, why do ſuch wiſe men, as the governours of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, teach boys what is entirely uſeleſs?
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032945_0058_0FF5E9C58B7983E8"/>
I thought that the ſum of all good edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was, to teach youth thoſe things, which they were to practiſe in after life. Learning, replied our enlightened viſitor, has its faſhions; and, like other faſhions of this world, they paſs away. When our forefathers founded the college, at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, critical knowledge in the mazes and ſubtleties of ſchool divinity was all the mode. He that could give a new turn to an old text, or detect a miſtranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the verſion, was more admired than the man, who invented printing, diſcovered the magnetic powers, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived an inſtrument of agriculture, which ſhould abridge the labour of the huſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. The books of our faith, with the voluminous commentaries of the fathers, being originally written, in what are now called, the dead languages, the knowledge of thoſe languages was then neceſſary, for the accompliſhment of the faſhionable ſcholar. The moderns, of New England,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032945_0059_0FF5E9F88D085978"/>
have ceaſed to intereſt themſelves in the diſputes, whether a civil oath may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered to an unregenerate man; or, whether ſouls, exiſting merely in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of Deity, are capable of actual tranſgreſſion. Faſhion has given a new direction to the purſuits of the learned. They no longer ſoar into the regions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſpace; but endeavour, by the aid of natural and moral philoſophy, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the manners and better the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man: and the college, at Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, may be aſſimilated to an old beau, with his pocket holes under his arm pits, the ſkirts of his coat to his ancles, and three groſs of buttons on his breeches; looking with contempt on the more eaſy, uſeful garb of the preſent day, for deviat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what was faſhionable in his youth.</p>
                     <p>But, inquired my father, is there not ſome valuable knowledge contained in thoſe Greek books? All that is uſeful in
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:032945_0060_0FF5E9C82DE5A240"/>
them, replied our viſitor, is already tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into Engliſh; and more of the ſenſe and ſpirit may be imbibed, from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, than moſt ſcholars would be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to extract, from the originals, if they even availed themſelves of ſuch an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with that language, as is uſually acquired, at college.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Well,</hi> replied my father, do you call them dead languages. It appears to me now, that confining a lad of lively genius to the ſtudy of them, for five or ſix of the moſt precious years of his youth, is like the ingenious cruelty of thoſe tyrants, I have heard of, who chained the living and the dead together. If Updike went to college, I ſhould wiſh he would learn, not <hi>hard words,</hi> but <hi>uſeful things.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>You ſpake of governours of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, continued our viſitor. Let me ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, as an apology, for the concern they may be ſuppoſed to have, in this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, that they are moral, worthy men,
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:032945_0061_0FF5E9FB1094D7B0"/>
who have paſſed the ſame dull routine of education, and whoſe knowledge is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily confined to theſe defunct languages. They muſt teach their pupils what they know, not what they do not know. That meaſure, which was meaſured unto them, they mete out, moſt liberally, unto others.</p>
                     <p>Should not the legiſlature, as the fathers of the people, interfere, inquired my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? We will not talk politics, at this time, replied our viſitor.</p>
                     <p>My father was now determined that I ſhould not go to college. He concealed this converſation from me, and I was left to be proud of my Greek. The little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, this deceaſed language has ſince been to me, has often cauſed me ſorely to regret the miſpenſe of time, in acquiring it. The French make it no part of their academical ſtudies. Voltaire, D'Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, and Diderot, when they completed their education, were probably ignorant of the <hi>cognata tempora</hi> of a Geek verb.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="unknown:032945_0062_0FF5E9CA2E754F80"/>
It was reſolved that I ſhould labour on my father's farm; but alas! a taſte for Greek had quite eradicated a love for la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Poring ſo intenſely on Homer and Virgil had ſo completely filled my brain with the heathen mythology, that I imagined a Hamadryade in every ſapling, a Naiad in every puddle; and expected to hear the ſobbings of the infant Fauns, as I turned the furrow. I gave Greek names to all our farming tools; and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cattle with hexameter verſe. My father's hired men, after a tedious day's labour in the woods, inſpecting our ſtores, for refreſhment, inſtead of the cuſtomary bread and cheeſe and brandy, found Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's Iliad, Virgil Delphini and Schreve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius's Lexicon, in the baſket.</p>
                     <p>After I had worked on the farm ſome months, having killed a fat heifer of my father's, upon which the family depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for their winter's beef, covered it with green boughs, and laid it in the ſhade to
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:032945_0063_0FF5E9FD1CE2DDF0"/>
putrify, in order to raiſe a ſwarm of bees, after the manner of Virgil; which proceſs, notwithſtanding I followed cloſely the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections in the georgics, ſome how or other, failed, my father conſented to my mother's requeſt, that I ſhould renew my career of learning.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>BY our miniſter's recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, I was engaged to keep a ſchool, in a neighbouring town, ſo ſoon as our fall's work was over.</p>
                     <p>How my heart dilated with the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, in the tedious interval, previous to my entering upon my ſchool. How oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en have I ſtood ſuſpended over my dung fork, and anticipated my ſcholars, ſeated
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032945_0065_0FF5E9FEA18FCC00"/>
in awful ſilence around me, my arm chair and birchen ſceptre of authority. There was an echo in my father's ſheep paſture. More than once have I repaired there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and exclaimed with a loud voice, is MASTER Updike Underhill at home? I would ſpeak with MASTER Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hill, for the pleaſure of hearing how my title ſounded. Doſt thou ſmile, indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reader, pauſe and recollect if theſe ſenſations have not been familiar to thee, at ſometime in thy life. If thou anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſdainfully—no—then I aver thou haſt never been a corporal in the militia, or a ſophimore at college.</p>
                     <p>At times, I however entertained leſs pleaſing, but more rational contemplations on my proſpects. As I had been once unmercifully whipt, for detecting my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a falſe concord, I reſolved to be mild in my government, to avoid all manual cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and doubted not by theſe means to ſecure the love and reſpect of my pupils.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="69" facs="unknown:032945_0066_0FF5E9CDB85090A0"/>
In the interim of ſchool hours, and in thoſe peaceful intervals, when my pupils were engaged in ſtudy, I hoped to indulge myſelf with my favourite Greek. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be overwhelmed with the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of their parents, for pouring the freſh inſtruction over the minds of their children, and teaching their young ideas how to ſhoot. I anticipated indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from my ſalary, which was to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to four dollars, hard money, per month, and my boarding; and expected to find amuſement and pleaſure among the circles of the young, and to derive infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and delight from the claſſic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of the miniſter.</p>
                     <p>In due time my ambition was gratified, and I placed at the head of a ſchool, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of about ſixty ſcholars. Excepting three or four overgrown boys of eighteen, the 'generality of them were under the age of ſeven years. Perhaps a more rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, ill bred, ignorant ſet, never were col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032945_0067_0FF5EA23BB764E28"/>
for the puniſhment of a poor peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue. To ſtudy in ſchool was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Inſtead of the ſilence I anticipated, there was an inceſſant clamour. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant among the jarring ſounds were, Sir, may I read? May I ſpell? Maſter, may I go out? Will maſter mend my pen? What with the pouting of the ſmall children, ſent to ſchool, not to learn, but to keep them out of "harm's way," and the gruff ſurly complaints of the larger ones, I was nearly diſtracted. Homer's <hi>poluphloſboio thalaſſes,</hi> roaring ſea, was a whiſper to it. My reſolution, to avoid beating of them, made me invent ſmall puniſhments, which often have a ſalutary impreſſion, on delicate minds; but they were inſenſible to ſhame. The putting of a paper fool's cap on one, and ordering an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other under my great chair, only excited mirth in the ſchool; which the very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquents themſelves often increaſed, by loud peals of laughter. Going, one froſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032945_0068_0FF5EA321DD23378"/>
morning, into my ſchool, I found one of the larger boys ſitting by the fire in my arm chair. I gently requeſted him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move. He replied that he would, when he had warmed himſelf; "father finds wood, and not you." To have my throne uſurped, in the face of the whole ſchool, ſhook my government to the centre. I immediately ſnatched my two foot rule, and laid it pretty ſmartly acroſs his back. He quitted the chair, muttering that he would tell father. I found his threats of more conſequence than I apprehended. The ſame afternoon, a tall, raw boned man called me to the door; immediately col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lering me with one hand, and holding a cart whip over my head with the other; with fury in his face, he vowed he would whip the ſkin from my bones, if ever I ſtruck Jotham again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ay, he would do it that very moment, if he was not afraid I would take the law of him. This was the only inſtance of the overwhelming grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032945_0069_0FF5EA00A7343970"/>
of parents I received. The next day, it was reported all over town, what a cruel man the maſter was. "Poor Jotham came into ſchool, half frozen and near fainting; maſter had been ſitting a whole hour by the warm fire; he only begged him to let him warm himſelf a little, when the maſter roſe in a rage, and cut open his head with the tongs, and his life was deſpaired of."</p>
                     <p>Fatigued with the vexations of my ſchool, I one evening repaired to the tav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern, and mixed with ſome of the young men of the town. Their converſation I could not reliſh; mine they could not comprehend. The ſubject of race horſes being introduced, I ventured to deſcant upon Xanthus, the immortal courſer of Achilles. They had never heard of 'ſquire Achilles, or his horſe; but they offered to bet two to one, that Bajazet, the Old Roan, or the deacon's mare, Pumpkin and Milk, would beat him, and challenged me to appoint time and place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="unknown:032945_0070_0FF5EA3433D33A28"/>
Nor was I more acceptable among the young women. Being invited to ſpend an evening, after a quilting, I thought this a happy opportunity to introduce Andromache, the wife of the great Hec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, at her loom; and Penelope, the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful wife of Ulyſſes, weaving her ſeven years web. This was received with a ſtupid ſtare, until I mentioned the long time the queen of Ulyſſes was weaving; when a ſmart young woman obſerved, that ſhe ſuppoſed Miſs Penelope's yarn was rotted in whitening, that made her ſo long: and then told a tedious ſtory of a piece of cotton and linen ſhe had herſelf woven, under the ſame circumſtances. She had no ſooner finiſhed, than, to enforce my obſervations, I recited above forty lines of Greek, from the Odeſſey, and then began a diſſertation on the <hi>caeſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.</hi> In the midſt of my harrangue, a florid faced young man, at the further end of the room, with two large promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:032945_0071_0FF5EA03343B0090"/>
foreteeth, remarkably white, began to ſing,
<q>
                           <l>"Fire upon the mountains, run boys, run;"</l>
                        </q>
And immediately the whole company ruſhed forward, to ſee who ſhould get a chance in the reel of ſix.</p>
                     <p>I was about retiring, fatigued and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted, when it was hinted to me, that I might wait on Miſs Mima home; but as I could recollect no word in the Greek, which would conſtrue into <hi>bundling,</hi> or any of Homer's heroes, who <hi>got the bag,</hi> I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined. In the Latin, it is true, that AEne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as and Dido, in the cave, ſeem ſomething like a precedent. It was reported all over the town, the next day, that maſter was a <hi>papiſh,</hi> as he had talked French two hours.</p>
                     <p>Diſappointed of recreation, among the young, my next object was the miniſter. Here I expected pleaſure and profit. He had ſpent many years in preaching, for the edification of private families, and was ſettled in the town, in a fit of enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm;
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032945_0072_0FF5EA364003EBE8"/>
when the people drove away a clergyman, reſpectable for his years and learning. This he was pleaſed to call an awakening. He lectured me, at the firſt onſet, for not attending the conference and night meetings; talked much of gifts, and decried human learning, as carnal and deviliſh, and well he might, he certainly was under no obligations to it; for a new ſinging maſter coming into town, the young people, by their maſter's advice, were for introducing Dr. Watts's verſion of the Pſalms. Although I argued with the miniſter an hour, he remains firmly convinced, to this day, that the verſion of Sternhold and Hopkins is the ſame in language, letter, and metre, with thoſe Pſalms King David chaunted, in the city of Jeruſalem.</p>
                     <p>As for the independence I had found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on my wages, it vaniſhed, like the reſt of my ſcholaſtic proſpects. I had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſome debts. My requeſt for preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:032945_0073_0FF5EA0534EE3B60"/>
payment, was received with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment. I found, I was not to expect it, until the next autumn, and then not in caſh, but produce; to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my own collector, and pick up my dues, half a peck of corn or rye in a place.</p>
                     <p>I was almoſt diſtracted, and yearned for the expiration of my contract, when an unexpected period was put to my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs. News was brought, that, by the careleſſneſs of the boys, the ſchool houſe was burnt down. The common cry now was, that I ought, in juſtice, to pay for it; as to my want of proper government the careleſſneſs of the boys ought to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted. The beating of Jotham was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, and a thouſand ſtories of my want of proper ſpirit circulated. Theſe reports, and even the loſs of a valuable <hi>Gradus ad Parnoſſum,</hi> did not damp my joy. I am ſometimes led to believe, that my e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancipation from real ſlavery in Algiers,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032945_0074_0FF5EA37C3C47E28"/>
did not afford me ſincerer joy, than I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced at that moment.</p>
                     <p>I returned to my father, who received me with kindneſs. My mother heard the ſtory of my diſcomfitures with tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; as, ſhe ſaid, ſhe had no doubt that her dream, about my falling into the hands of ſavages, was now out.</p>

and diſcovered the circulation of the ſoul had, in the full exerciſe of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, played at duck and drake, on the Thames, with his gold watch, while he gravely returned the pebble ſtone, which he held in his other hand, into his fob; and, that the learned Sir Iſaac Newton made ſoap bladders with the funk of a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco pipe, and was, ever after, ſo enam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured with his ſooty funk, as to make uſe of the delicate finger of a young lady, he courted, as a pipe ſtopper.</p>
                     <p>I was allowed the choice of my profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to diſcover the bent of my genius. By the advice of a friend, my father put into my hands, what he was told were ſome of the prime books, in the ſeveral ſciences. In divinity, I read ten funer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, five election, three ordination, and ſeventeen farewell ſermons, Bunyan's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly War, the Life of Colonel Gardner, and the Religious Courtſhip.

Burn's Juſtice abridged. In phyſic, Buchan's Family Phyſician, Culpepper's Midwifery, and Turner's Surgery. The agreeable manner in which this laſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor relates his own wonderful cures, the lives of his patients, and his remarkable dexterity, in extracting a pound of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, from the arm of a wounded ſoldier; the ſpirited horſe, the neat little ſaddle bags, and tipped bridle, of our own doctor, determined me in favour of phyſic. My father did not oppoſe my choice. He only dryly obſerved, that he did not know what pretenſions our family had to prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe phyſic, as he could not learn that we had ever been remarkable for killing any but Indians.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE next ſpring, I entered upon my ſtudies, with a phyſician, not more juſtly celebrated for his knowledge of the materia medica, than for his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar dexterity and ſucceſs, in couching for the gutta ſerena, and reſtoring perſons, even born blind, to ſight. The account of a cure he performed, after I had been with him about a year, may not be unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the lovers of natural reſearch.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032945_0079_0FF5EA0ACC41EC98"/>
The ſubject was a young man, of twenty two years of age, of a ſweet diſpoſition, amiable manners, and oppulent connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions. He was born ſtone blind. His blindneſs was in ſome meaſure compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated, by the attention of his friends; and the encreaſed power of his other or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans of perception. His brothers and ſiſters enriched his mind, by reading to him, in ſucceſſion, two hours every day, from the beſt authors. His ſenſe of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was aſtoniſhingly delicate, and his hearing, if poſſible, more acute. His ſenſes of taſte and ſmelling, were not ſo remarkable. After the cuſtomary ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of ſhaking hands, with a ſtranger, he would know a perſon, by the touch of the ſame hand, ſeveral years after, though abſent in the interim. He could read a book or news paper, newly printed, tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erably well, by tracing, with the tip of his finger, the indents of the types. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired a knowledge of the letters of the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032945_0080_0FF5C40334B5E968"/>
alphabet early, from the prominent let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the gingerbread alphabets of the baker. He was maſter of muſic, and had contrived a board, perforated with many gimblet holes; and, with the aſſiſtance of a little bag of wooden pegs, ſhaped at top, according to his directions, he could prick almoſt any tune, upon its being ſung to him. When in a large company, who ſat ſilent, he could diſtinguiſh how many perſons were preſent, by noting, with his ear, their different manner of breathing. By the rarity or denſity of the air, not perceivable by thoſe in company, he could diſtinguiſh high ground from low; and by the motion of the ſummer's breeze, too ſmall to move the loftieſt leaf, he would pronounce, whether he was in a wood or open country.</p>
                     <p>He was an unfeigned believer, in the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utary truths of chriſtianity. He had imbib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its benevolent ſpirit. When he ſpoke of religion, his language was love to God,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:032945_0081_0FF5EA0D52711990"/>
and good will to man. He was no zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ot, but, when he talked of the wonders of creation, he was animated with a glow of enthuſiaſm. You obſerved, the other day, as we were walking on this plain, my friend, addreſſing himſelf to me, as I was intimate in the family, that you knew a certain perſon, by his gait, when at ſo great a diſtance, that you could not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern his features. From this you took oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to obſerve, that you ſaw the maſter hand of the great Creator, in the obvious difference that was between man and man: not only the groſſer difference between the Indian, the African, the Eſquimeaux, and the white man; but that which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhes and defines accurately, men of the ſame nation, and even children of the ſame parents. You obſerved, that as all the children of the great family of the earth, were compounded of ſimilar members, features, and lineaments, how wonderfully it diſplayed the ſkill of the
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:032945_0082_0FF5EA3E89FC2318"/>
Almighty Artiſt, to model ſuch an infinite variety of beings, and diſtinctly diverſify them, from the ſame materials. You added, that the incident, you had noticed, gave freſh inſtance of admiration; for you was now convinced that, if even all men had been formed of ſo near reſemblance, as not to be diſcerned from each other, when at reſt; yet, when in motion, from their gait, air, and manner, they might readily be diſtinguiſhed. While you ſpoke, I could perceive, that you pitied me, as being blind to a wonderful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of creative power. I too, in my turn, could triumph. Blind as I am, I have diſcovered a ſtill minuter, but as certain a diſtinction, between the children of men, which has eſcaped the touch of your eyes. Bring me five men, perfect ſtrangers to me; pair the nails of the ſame finger, ſo as to be even with the fingers' ends, let me touch, with the tip of my finger, the nails thus prepared. Tell me each perſon's
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:032945_0083_0FF5EA0ED7337BD0"/>
name, as he paſſes in contact before me, bring the ſame perſons to me one month afterwards, with their nails paired, in the ſame manner, and I will call every one by his right name. For, be aſſured, my friend, that artiſt, who has denied to me that thing called light, hath opened the eyes of my mind, to know that there is not a greater difference between the African and the European, than what I could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, between the finger nails of all the men of this world. This experiment he afterwards tried, with uniform ſucceſs. It was amuſing, in a gayer hour, to hear him argue the ſuperiority of the touch to the ſight. Certainly, the feeling is a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler ſenſe, than that you call ſight. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it from the care nature has taken of the former, and her diſregard to the latter. The eyes are comparatively poor, puny, weak organs. A ſmall blow, a mote, or a ſtraw may reduce thoſe, who ſee with them, to a ſituation as pitiable as mine; while
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:032945_0084_0FF5EA400DA9B9F8"/>
feeling is diffuſed over the whole body. Cut off my arm, and a ſenſe of feeling re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains. Completely diſmember me, and, while I live, I poſſeſs it. It is coexiſtent with life itſelf.</p>
                     <p>The ſenſes of ſmelling and taſte are but modifications of this noble ſenſe, diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, through the inaccuracy of men, by other names. The flavour of the moſt delicious morſel is felt by the tongue; and, when we ſmell the aromatic, it is the effluvia of the roſe, which comes in contact with the olfactory nerves. You, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy ſight, inadvertently confeſs its inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority. My brother, honing his penknife, the other day, paſſed it over his thumb nail, to diſcover if the edge was ſmooth. I heard him, and inquired, why he did not touch it with his eyes, as he did other objects. He confeſſed that he could not diſcover the gaps, by the ſight. Here, the ſuperiority of the moſt inaccurate ſeat of the feeling, was manifeſt. To conclude,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:032945_0085_0FF5EA10DAFD6C80"/>
he would archly add: in marriage, the moſt important concern in life, how many miſerable, of both ſexes, are left to deplore, in tears, their dependence on this treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous thing, called ſight. From this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, I am happily ſecured, continued he, ſmiling and preſſing the hand of his cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, who ſat beſide him; a beautiful blooming young woman, of eighteen, who had been bred with him, from child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and whoſe affection for him, was ſuch that ſhe was willing, notwithſtanding his blindneſs, to take him as a partner for life. They expected ſhortly to be married. Notwithſtanding his accuracy and verac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity upon ſubjects, he could comprehend; there were many, on which he was miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly confuſed. He called ſight the touch of the eyes. He had no adequate idea of colours. White, he ſuppoſed, was like the feeling of down; and ſcarlet he reſembled to the ſound of martial muſic. By paſſing his hands over the porcelain, earthern, or
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032945_0086_0FF5EA419DD4B800"/>
plaiſter of Paris images, he could readily conceive of their being repreſentations of men or animals. But he could have no idea of pictures. I preſented him a large picture of his grand father, painted with oil colours on canvaſs; told him whoſe reſemblance it was. He paſſed his hand over the ſmooth ſurface and muſed. He repeated this; exclaimed it was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; looked melancholy; but never aſked for the picture again.</p>
                     <p>Upon this young man, my preceptor operated ſucceſsfully. I was preſent during the whole proceſs, though few were admitted. Upon the introduction of the couching inſtruments, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the film from the retina, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared confuſed. When the operation was completed, and he was permitted to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round him, he was violently agitated. The irritability of the ophthalmic muſcles faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expreſſed the perturbation of his mind. After two and twenty years of total dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:032945_0087_0FF5EA136165F128"/>
to be thus awakened to a new world of ſenſation and light; to have ſuch a flood of day poured on his benighted eye ball, overwhelmed him. The infant ſight was too weak, for the ſhock, and he fainted. The doctor immediately intercepted the light with the proper bandages, and, by the application of volatiles, he was reviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The next day, the dreſſings were removed. He had fortified his mind, and was more calm. At firſt, he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have loſt more than he had gained, by being reſtored to viſion. When blind, he could walk tolerably well, in places familiar to him. From ſight, he collected no ideas of diſtance. Green was a colour peculiarly agreeable to the new born ſight. Being led to the window, he was charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a tree in full verdure, and extended his arms to touch it, though at ten rods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. To diſtinguiſh objects within reach, he would cloſe his eyes, feel of them with his hands, and then look earneſtly upon them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="unknown:032945_0088_0FF5EA44A3AE56A0"/>
According to a preconcerted plan, the third day, his bandages were removed, in the preſence of his parents, brothers, ſiſters, friends, and of the amiable, lovely girl, to whom he was ſhortly to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. By his requeſt, a profound ſilence was to be obſerved, while he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſcover the perſon of her, who was the object of his deareſt affection. It was an intereſting ſcene. The company obeyed his injunction. Not a finger mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or a breath aſpirated. The bandage was then removed; and, when he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered from the confuſion of the inſtant effuſion of light, he paſſed his eye haſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly over the whole group. His ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were novel and intereſting. It was a moment of importance. For aught he knew, he might find the boſom part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of his future life, the twin ſoul of his affection, in the fat ſcullion wench, of his father's kitchen; or in the perſon of the toothleſs, palſied, decriped
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:032945_0089_0FF5EA156735B070"/>
nurſe, who held the baſon of gruel at his elbow.</p>
                     <p>In paſſing his eye a ſecond time over the circle, his attention was arreſted, by his beloved couſin. The agitations of her love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly features, and the evaneſcent bluſh on her cheek, would have at once betrayed her, to a more experienced eye. He paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his eye to the next perſon, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately returned it to her. It was a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment big with expectation. Many a finger was raiſed to the lips of the ſpectators, and many a look, expreſſive of the ſilence ſhe ſhould preſerve, was caſt towards her. But the conflict was too violent for her delicate frame. He looked more intenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſhe burſt into tears, and ſpoke. At the well known voice he cloſed his eyes, ruſhed towards her, and claſped her in his arms. I envied them their feelings; but I thought then, and do now, that the ſenſations of my preceptor, the ſkilful hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane operator, were more enviable. The
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:032945_0090_0FF5EA4629FD8EB8"/>
man who could reſtore life and uſefulneſs, to the darling of his friends, and ſcatter light in the paths of an amiable young pair, muſt have known a joy never ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; except, with reverence be it ſpoken, by the ſatiſfaction of our benevolent Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, when, by his miraculous power, he opened the eyes of the actually blind, made the dumb to ſing, and the lame and impotent leap for joy.</p>

in the year one thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty five; he exhibited a more aſtoniſhing illuſtration of the power of the touch. A highly poliſhed plane of ſteel was preſented to him, with a ſtroke of an etching tool, ſo minutely engraved upon it, that it was inviſible to the naked eye, and only diſcoverable with a powerful magnifying glaſs; with his fingers he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the extent, and meaſured the length of the line.</p>

                     <p>I PASSED my time very a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably, with my preceptor; though I could not help being aſtoniſhed, that a man of his acknowledged learning, ſhould not, ſometimes, quote Greek. Of my acquirements, in that language, I was ſtill proud. I attributed the indifference, with which it was received in the town, where I had kept ſchool, to the ruſticity
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:032945_0095_0FF5EA1A77C99208"/>
and ignorance of the people.

                     <p>But the moſt ſonorous lines of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine blind bard were received with cold approbation of politeneſs. One young lady, alone, ſeemed pleaſed. She would frequently aſk me, to repeat thoſe lines of Wabaſh poetry. Though once, in the ſublime paſſage of the hero Ulyſſes, hanging fifty young maidens, with his own hands, in the Odyſſey, I heard the term, pedant, pronounced with peculiar emphaſis, by a beau, at my back. If I had taken the hint, and paſſed my Greek
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:032945_0096_0FF5EA4CD001C740"/>
upon my companions, for Indian, they would have heard me with rapture. I have ſince known that worthy, indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſſionary to the Indians, the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end Mr. K—, and the modern Elliot, entertain the ſame companies, for whole evenings, with ſpeeches in the aboriginal of America, as unintelligible to them, as my inſulted Greek.</p>
                     <p>I was ſo pleaſed with the young lady, who approved the Greek heroics, that I determined to make my firſt eſſay, in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, in an ode, addreſſed to her, by name. I accordingly muſtered all the high ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing epithets of the immortal Grecian bard, and ſcattered them with profuſion, through my ode. I praiſed her golden locks, and aſſimilated her to the ox eyed Juno; ſent her a correct copy, and diſperſed a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of others, among her friends. I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards found, that what I intended as the ſublimeſt panegyric, was received as cutting inſult. The golden treſſes, and
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:032945_0097_0FF5EA1D91957318"/>
the ox eyed epithet, the moſt favourite paſſages, in my poem, were very unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate; as the young lady was remarkable, for very prominent eyes, which reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled what, in horſes, are called wall eyes. Her hair was, what is vulgarly called, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roty. Its unfaſhionable colour ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, in vain, to conceal, by the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſe of a leaden comb.</p>

                     <p>THE very next morning, after I had preſented my ode, and before I had heard of its reception, a young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, very genteelly dreſſed, entered our drug room, where I was compounding a cathartic, with my ſpatula; and, with a very ſtately air, inquired for Mr. Updike Underhill. Upon being informed that I was the perſon, with two of the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found bows, I had ever ſeen, he advanced
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:032945_0099_0FF5EA1F16BCF7F8"/>
towards me, and with ſlow and ſolemn em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis, ſaid, then ſir, I have the honour to preſent you with a billet, from my friend, Mr. Jaſper T—. Two more bows, as ſtately and low as the former. I took the letter, which was as big as a government<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al packet; and, in the midſt of a large folio ſheet, read the following letter, from Mr. Jaſper T—, a profeſſed admirer of the young lady, to whom I had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed my ode, after the manner of the Greeks.</p>

                     <p>Though I was engaged to watch that night, with one of my preceptor's cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; yet, as Mr. Jaſper T—, ſeemed ſo friendly and civil, I could not find it in my heart, to refuſe him, and replied that I would, with pleaſure, wait upon the gentleman. Sir, reſumed the bearer, you are a man of honour, every inch of you, and I am your moſt obedient, moſt obſequious, and moſt humble ſervant: and then, making two profound bows, in the ſhop, and one more at the door, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired. He was no ſooner departed, than I ſat down, to reperuſe this elegant and
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032945_0101_0FF5EA21A0E02340"/>
very extraordinary billet. I had no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acquaintance with Mr. Jaſper T—, and why he ſhould write to me, at all, puzzled me. The firſt part of the letter, I doubted not, contained an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of my ode, and a requeſt to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged with an explanation of ſome of its peculiar beauties. I began to recollect illuſtrations and parodies, from ſome fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite paſſages in the Iliad. But, what we were to do, in waſting a few charges of powder, was utterly inexplicable. At one time, indeed, I thought it an invitation to ſhoot partridges, and bethought myſelf of ſcouring a long barrelled gun, which had deſcended as an heir loom in our family; and had, perhaps, killed Indians, on Long Iſland, in the hands of my brave anceſtor, Captain John Underhill. Then again, I reflected, that the lower end of a wharf, in a populous town, was not the moſt probable place, to ſpring a covey of partridges. But what puzzled me moſt,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032945_0102_0FF5EA526C365048"/>
was his punctual attention to hours, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſeconds. My doubts were all clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the entrance of a fellow ſtudent, to whom I communicated the letter. He was born in Carolina, and underſtood the whole buſineſs. It is a challenge, ſaid he. A challenge! exclaimed I. For what? Why only, repeated he cooly, to fight a duel, with Mr. Jaſper T—, with ſword and piſtol. Pho! replied I, you banter. Do look at the concluſion of the letter. Will you make me believe that any man, in his ſenſes, would conclude, with all theſe expreſſions of eſteem and friendſhip, an invitation to give him an opportunity of cutting my throat, or blowing by brains out? You have been bred in yankee land, replied my fellow ſtudent. Men of hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our are above the common rules of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety and common ſenſe. This letter, which is a challenge, bating ſome little inaccuracies of grammar and ſpelling, in ſubſtance, I aſſure you, would not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:032945_0103_0FF5C4019C11C2B0"/>
grace a man of the higheſt honour; and, if Mr. Jaſper T—acts as much the man of honour, on the wharf, as he has on paper, he will preſerve the ſame ſtile of good breeding and politeneſs there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. While, with one hand, he, with a deadly longe, paſſes his ſword through your lungs, he will take his hat off, with the other, and bow gracefully to your corps. Lord deliver me from ſuch po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs, exclaimed I. It ſeems to me, by your account of things, that the principal difference between a man of honour, and a vulgar murderer, is that the latter will kill you in a rage, while the former will write you complaiſant letters, and ſmile in your face, and bow gracefully, while he cuts your throat. Honour, or no hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, I am plaguy ſorry I accepted his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitation. Come, continued my fellow ſtudent, you conſider this little affair too ſeriouſly. I muſt indoctrinate you. There is no more danger, in these town
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:032945_0104_0FF5EA550BA487A0"/>
duels, than in pounding our great mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar. Why, I fought three duels myſelf in Carolina, before I was ſeventeen years old; and one was for an affront offered to the negro wench, who ſuckled me: and I declare I had rather fight ten more, than paſs once, in a ſtage waggon, over Horſe Neck. I ſee your antagoniſt has offered you to bring a ſecond. I will go with you. When you arrive on the ground, we ſeconds ſhall mark out your poſition, to ſtand in, and to be ſure, as in caſe of blood ſhed, we ſhall come into difficulty, we ſhall place you at a pretty reſpectable diſtance. You will then turn a copper for the firſt fire; but I ſhould adviſe you to grant it to him. This will give him a vaſt idea of your firmneſs, and contempt of danger. Your antagoniſt, with baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from his country, and the gallows ſtaring him in the face, will be ſure not to hit you, on his own account. The ball will paſs, at leaſt, ten rods over your head.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:032945_0105_0FF5EA25CE7F9BE0"/>
You muſt then diſcharge your piſtol, in the air, and offer him to fire again; as, in the language of the duelliſt, you will have given him his life, ſo it will be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inconſiſtent, in him, to again attempt yours. We ſeconds ſhall immediately interfere, and pronounce you both men of honour. The matter in controverſy will be paſſed over. You will ſhake hands, commence warm friends, and the ladies will adore you. Oh! Updike, you are a lucky fellow. I cannot think, ſaid I, why Mr. Jaſper T—, ſhould have ſuch bloody deſigns againſt me. I never intended to affront the young lady. Liſp not a word of that, replied my inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as you value your reputation on 'change. When he has fired over your head, you may confeſs what you pleaſe, with honour; but however inoffenſive you may have been, if you make ſuch a confeſſion before, you are a man of no honour. You will be poſted, in the coffee

houſe, for a coward. Notwithſtanding the comfortable addreſs of my friend, the thoughts of a premature death, or being crippled for life, diſtreſſed me. Nor was the fear of killing my antagoniſt, and of what my poor parents would ſuffer, from my being expoſed to infamous puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, leſs alarming. I paſſed ſome hours of dreadful anxiety; when I was relieved from my diſtreſs, in a way I little appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. My challenger, who had lived ſome years in town, as a merchant's clerk, viewing me as a raw lad, from the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that would never dare accept his challenge, when this meſſenger returned, was petrified with aſtoniſhment. When aſſured that I had accepted his challenge, as a man of courage and honour, his heart died within him. His friend had no ſooner gone to prepare the piſtols, than by communicating the buſineſs, as a great ſecret, to two or three female friends, the intended duel was noiſed about town.
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:032945_0107_0FF5EA2753BBF0E0"/>
The juſtices, ſelectmen, and grand jurors, convened. Warrants were iſſued, and conſtables diſpatched into all quarters. I was apprehended, in the ſick man's chamber, where I was watching, by the high ſheriff, two deputies, three conſtables, and eleven ſtout aſſiſtants; carried, in the dead of the night, before the magiſtrates, where I met my antagoniſt, guarded by a platoon of the militia, with a colonel at their head. We were directed to ſhake hands, make friends, and pronounce, on our honours, that we would drop an affair, which we had, neither of us, any heart to purſue. My acceptance of the challenge, however unintentional, eſtabliſhed my reputation, among the bucks and belles. The former pronounced me a man of ſpunk and ſpirit; and the latter were proud of my arm in an evening rural walk on the paved ſtreet. None dared to call me pedant; and, I verily believe that, if I had ſpouted a whole Iliad, in the ball
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:032945_0108_0FF5EA5896CCC2F0"/>
room, no one would have ventured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt me: for I had proved myſelf a MAN OF HONOUR.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the circle of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, there was a young lady, of not the moſt promiſing perſon, and, of rather a vinegar aſpect, who was juſt approxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating towards thirty years of age. Though, by avoiding married parties, mingling with very young company, dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing airily; ſhivering in lawn and ſarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net, at meeting, in December; affecting a girliſh liſp, bluſh, and giggle, ſhe was ſtill endeavouring to ward off that invidious appellation of old maid. Upon good grounds, I am led to believe, that the charity of the tea table had added to her
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:032945_0110_0FF5EA5AA43BB220"/>
years; becauſe, from a long acquaintance with her, I could never induce her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member any event, however trivial, which happened before Lexington battle. The girls, of my age, reſpected me, as a man of ſpirit; but I was more fond of being eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed, as a man of learning. This young lady loved literature, and lamented to me her ignorance of the Greek. I gave her a decided preference to her rivals. She borrowed books of me, and read them with aſtoniſhing rapidity. From my own little library, and from thoſe of my friends, I procured above ſixty vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umes for her; among which were Locke on Human Underſtanding, Stackhouſe's Body of Divinity, and Glaſs's works, not on cookery, but the benignant works of John Glaſs, the father of Sandiman, and the Sandimanians; in which collection I did not however omit Pope's Homer, and Dryden's Virgil: and, to my aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though I knew that her afternoons
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:032945_0111_0FF5EA2C0A991AB0"/>
were devoted to the ſtructure of caps and bonnets, ſhe peruſed thoſe ſixty volumes completely, and returned them to me, in leſs than a month. There was one thing peculiarly pleaſing to me, as a man of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; that ſhe never made dog leaves, or ſoiled the books; a ſlovenly practice, of which even great ſcholars are ſome times guilty. I would, at times, endeavour to draw her into a converſation, upon the author ſhe had recently peruſed. She would bluſh, look down, and ſay that it did not become a young girl, like her, to talk upon ſuch ſubjects, with a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of my ſenſe. The compliment it contained ever rendered the apology irreſiſtable. One day, ſhe aſked me to lend her a dictionary. I immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for her the great Doctor Johnſon's, in two volumes folio. About three days afterwards, ſhe offered to return them. Knowing that a dictionary was a work, to which reference was often neceſſary<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="115" facs="unknown:032945_0112_0FF5EA5D20CEA6B0"/>
and, thinking it might be of ſome ſervice to every lady of her learning, I preſſed her to keep it longer. When ſhe replied, with the prettieſt liſp imaginable, that they were indeed very pretty ſtory books; but, ſince I had lent them to her, ſhe had read them all through twice; and then inquired, with the ſame gentle liſp, if I could not lend her a book, called Rolling Belly Lettres. I was in abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute aſtoniſhment. Virgil's traveller, treading on the ſnake in the graſs, was comparatively in perfect compoſure. I took a folio under each arm, and ſkipped out of the houſe, as lightly as if I had had nothing heavier, than a late antifeder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al election ſermon to carry. This learned young lady was amazingly affronted, at my abrupt departure; but, when the cauſe of it was explained to her, ſome months after, ſhe endeavoured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade a journeyman tailor, who courted her niece, to challenge me to fight a
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:032945_0113_0FF5EA2E0F94C118"/>
duel, who actually penned a challenge, upon one of his maſter's paſteboard pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns; and, I verily believe, would have ſent it, by his ſecond, if he had not been informed, that my character was eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, as a man of honour.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>DISGUSTED with the friv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olity of the young, and the deceit of the antiquated, I now applied myſelf ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly to my ſtudies. Cullen, Munroe, Boerhaave, and Hunter, were my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant companions. As I progreſſed in val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uable ſcience, my admiration of the Greek declined. I now found, that Machaon and Podalirious, the ſurgeons of Homer, were mere quacks; ignorant of even the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:032945_0115_0FF5EA2F9576A100"/>
of plaiſters, or the eighteen tailed bandage: and, in botany, inferiour to the Indian Powwows; and that the green ointment, of my learned friend, Doctor Kitteridge, would have immortalized a bone ſetter, in the Grecian era, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated him, with Eſculapius, to a ſeat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the gods. In juſtice to that ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable language, and to the learned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Cambridge, Yale, and Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, I will candidly confeſs, that my knowledge of it, was now, in the firſt year of my apprenticeſhip, of ſome ſervice to me, in now and then finding the root of the labels cyphered on our gallipots. I ſhall mention a little incident, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened about this time, as it contains a leſſon, valuable to the reader, if he has penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion enough to diſcover it, and candour e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to apply it to himſelf. Though I applied myſelf closſely to my books; yet, as hours of relaxation were recommended, by my preceptor, I ſometimes indulged
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:032945_0116_0FF5EA60B00B54E8"/>
in the dance, and in ſleighing rides. The latter being propoſed, at a time when I was without the means of paying my club, I had retired, with diſcontent, to my chamber; where I accidentally caſt my eyes upon a little old faſhioned duodeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo bible, with ſilver claſps, in the corner of my trunk, a preſent from my mother, at parting; who had recommended the frequent peruſal of it, as my guide in difficulty, and conſolation in diſtreſs. Young people, in perplexity, always think of home. The bible reproached me. To remove the uneaſy ſenſation, and for the want of ſomething more agreeable to do, I took up the neglected book. No ſooner had I unclaſped it, than a guinea dropt from the leaves, which had been depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there, by the generous care of my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate mother; and, by my inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inattention, had lain there undiſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for more than two years. I haſtily ſnatched the brilliant prize, joined my
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:032945_0117_0FF5EA96403C0B18"/>
young companions, and reſolved that, in gratitude, I would read a chapter in the bible, every remaining day of my life. This reſolution I then perſevered in, a whole fortnight. As I am on this ſubject, I will obſerve, though no zealot, I have ſince, in the hours of miſery and poverty, with which the reader ſhall be acquainted, in the ſequel, drawn treaſures of ſupport and conſolation, from that bleſt book, more precious than the gems of Golcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, or the gold of Ophir.</p>

                     <p>IN June, one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty five, I completed my ſtudies. My enlightened, gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preceptor, preſented me with a Diſpenſatory, Cullen's Firſt Lines, and an elegant ſhaped caſe of pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et ſurgical inſtruments. As it is poſſible that ſome friend of his may peruſe this work, ſuffer me to pay him a little tribute of gratitude. He was an unaffected gentleman, and a man of liberal ſcience. In him were united,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:032945_0119_0FF5EA984CE9B9A0"/>
the acute chymiſt, the accurate botan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt, the ſkilful operator, and profound phyſician. He poſſeſſed all the eſſence, without the parade of learning. In the moſt ſimple language, he would trace the latent diſeaſe, to its diagnoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic; and, from his lips, ſubjects the moſt abſtruſe, were rendered familiar to the unlettered man. Excepting when he was with his pupils, or men of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I never heard him uſe a technical term. He obſerved once, that the bold truths of Paracelſus delighted him; but, it partook ſo much of the ſpeech of our country practitioners, that he was diſguſted with the pompoſity of Theophraſtus Bombaſtus. He was both an inſtructor and parent to his pupils. An inſtructor in all the depth of ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he poſſeſſed, and a tender parent in directing them, in the paths of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and uſefulneſs. May he long live, to bleſs his country with the healing

art; and, may he be hereafter bleſt himſelf, in that world, which will open new ſources of intelligence, to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring mind.</p>

When I inquired for the natural curioſities of New England, with ſpecimens of the rude arts, arms, and antiquities of the original poſſeſſors of our ſoil, I was ſhewn, for the former, an overgrown gourd ſhell,

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the autumn of one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty five, I returned to my parents, who received me with rapture. My father had reared, for me, a likely pie bald mare. Our ſaddler e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipped me with horſe furniture, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the little ſaddle bags, which I rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repleniſhed with drugs, purchaſed at Boſton. With a few books, and my ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's inſtruments, in my portmanteau, and a few dollars in my pocket, I ſat out,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:032945_0126_0FF5EA6AE607A050"/>
with a light heart, to ſeek practice, fame, and fortune, as a country practitioner.</p>
                     <p>My primary object was to obtain a place of ſettlement. This I imagined an eaſy taſk, from my own acquirements, and the celebrity of my preceptor. My firſt ſtop was at a new townſhip, though tolerably well ſtocked with a hardy labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſet of inhabitants. Five phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians of eminence had, within a few years, attempted a ſettlement in this place. The firſt fell a ſacrifice to ſtrong liquor; the ſecond put his truſt in horſes, and was ruined, by the loſs of a valuable ſire; the third quarrelled with the midwife, and was obliged to remove; the fourth hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſcribed, rather unluckily, for a young woman of his acquaintance, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly afflicted with a tympany, went to the Ohio; and the laſt, being a prudent man, who ſold his books and inſtruments for wild land, and raiſed his own crop of medicine, was actually in the way of
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:032945_0127_0FF5EAA085B3EE30"/>
making a great fortune; as, in only ten years practice, he left, at his deceaſe, an eſtate, both real and perſonal, which was appraiſed at one hundred pounds, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful money. This account was not likely to engage the attention of a young man, upon whoſe education twice the ſum had been expended.</p>
                     <p>In the next town, I was aſſured I might do well, as a phyſician, if I would keep a grog ſhop, or let myſelf, as a labourer, in the hay ſeaſon, and keep a ſchool in the winter. The firſt part of the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I heard with patience; but, at the bare mention of a ſchool, I fled the town abruptly. In the neighbouring town, they did not want a phyſician, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced itinerant doctor viſited the place, every March, when the people had moſt leiſure to be ſick and take phyſic. He practiſed with great ſucceſs, eſpecially in ſlow conſumptions, charged very low, and took his pay in any thing and every
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:032945_0128_0FF5EA6D6131D168"/>
thing. Beſides, he carried a mould with him, to run pewter ſpoons, and was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually good at mending a kettle and a conſtitution.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AT length, I fixed my reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in a town, where four phyſicians were already in full practice, of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety in theory, that I never knew any two of them agree in any practice, but in abuſing me, and decrying my ſkill. It was however four months before I had
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:032945_0130_0FF5EA6F6C368310"/>
any practice, except the extracting of a tooth, from a corn fed girl, who ſpun at my lodgings, who uſed to look wiſtfully at me, and aſk, if the doctorer did not think the tooth ache a ſign of love? and ſay ſhe felt dreadfully all over; and the application of a young virgin, in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, who wiſhed to be favoured with a private lecture upon the virtues of the ſavin buſh. I verily believe I might have remained there to this day unemployed, if my landlord, a tavern keeper, finding my payment for board rather tardy, had not, by ſometimes ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his boy, in a violent haſte, to call me out of meeting, and always vowing I was cute at the trade, at length drawn the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the people towards me.</p>
                     <p>I had now ſome opportunity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing my information, by inſpecting the practice of my ſeniors. The principal phyſician had been regularly educated. As I had been likewiſe, he affected to pay
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:032945_0131_0FF5EAA418BB15D0"/>
me ſome attention, on purpoſe to mortify thoſe three quacks, who, he ſaid, had picked up their knowledge, as they did their medicine, by the way ſide. He was a very formal man, in manners and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. He viewed freſh air highly noxious, in all diſeaſes. I once viſited a patient of his, in dog days, whoſe parched tongue and acrid ſkin denoted a violent fever. I was almoſt ſuffocated, upon entering the room. The windows were cloſed, and the cracks ſtuffed with tow; the curtains were drawn cloſe round the patient's bed, which was covered with a rug, and three comfortable blankets; a large fire was made in the room; the door lifted, and the key hole ſtopped; while the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor gravely adminiſtered irritating ſtim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulants to allay the fever. He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a favourite practical author, in his bags, and after finding the patient's caſe, in the index, pulled out a pair of money ſcales, and, with the utmoſt nicety,
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:032945_0132_0FF5EA70F1E00D18"/>
weighed off the preſcribed doſe, to the decimal of a drachm. He told me, as a great ſecret, that about thirteen years and one day paſt, he had nearly deſtroyed a patient, by adminiſtering half a drachm of pill cochia more than was preſcribed in the books. He was called the learned doctor.</p>
                     <p>The practice of the ſecond town phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician was directly oppoſite. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed large doſes of the moſt powerful drugs. If he had been inclined to weigh his medicine, I believe it would have been with groſs weight, rather than troy. He was an untaught diſciple of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Ratcliffe, careleſs, daring, and often ſucceſsful. He was admirable in ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous caſes, roſe cancers, and white ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Upon the firſt ſymptoms of theſe ſtubborn diſorders, he would drive them, and the ſubjects of them, to a ſtate of qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence. He was called the cheap doctor; becauſe he always ſpeedily cured or—killed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="unknown:032945_0133_0FF5EAA62C28F268"/>
The third phyſician dealt altogether in ſimples. The only compound he ever gave, or took, was buttered flip, for a cough. It was ſaid, that, if he did no good, he never did any harm. He was called the ſafe doctor.</p>
                     <p>The fourth phyſician was not celebrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for being learned, ſafe, or cheap; but he had more practice than all the other three together, for he was a muſical<note n="*" place="bottom">Do not let guitars and fiddles poſſeſs thy brain, gentle reader.

                     </argument>
                     <p>THERE was another gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in town, who had ſome pretenſions to the character of a phyſician: even the ſame pretenſions with the crowned heads of Europe, to their wiſdom, power, and greatneſs. He derived it from his birth; for he was the ſeventh ſon of a ſeventh ſon, and his mother was a doctreſs. He did not indeed bear the name or rank, but I remember him with the learned; as he was ſometimes called to viſit a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, at that critical, intereſting period,

when the other phyſicians had given him over; but his ordinary practice lay whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly among ſheep, horſes, and cattle. He alſo could boaſt of aſtoniſhing ſucceſs, and was as proud and opinionated as the beſt of them; and, for aught I know, it was as inſtructive to hear him talk of his ring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bones, wind galls, and ſpavins, as to hear our firſt phyſician deſcant upon his paroxyſms and peripneumony.</p>
                     <p>Being ſent for, one day, to attend a man whoſe leg was ſaid to be broken, by a fall from a frame at a raiſing, I found, upon my arrival at the patient's, that a brother of the faculty, from the vicinity, had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived before me, and completed the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. He was celebrated for his ſkill in deſperate caſes; and univerſally allowed to be a man of learning. He had preſcribed a gill of burnt brandy, with a pepper pod in it, to keep up the patient's ſpirits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the operation, and took another him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to keep his hand ſteady. He ſplin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:032945_0136_0FF5EA758FABC7A0"/>
the fractured limb, with the bone of two pair of old faſhioned ſtays, he had cauſed to be ript to pieces and bound round the leg, with all the garters in the neighbourhood. He bowed gracefully, as I entered, and regretted extremely that he had not my aſſiſtance in ſetting the bones; and with a loud voice, and the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled aſſurance, began to lay the caſe before me, and amplify the operation he had performed. Sir, ſaid he, when I came to view the patient, I had little hopes of ſaving his life. I found the two leſſer bones of the leg, the muſa and the triſtis ſhivered into a thouſand ſplinters. While the larger bone, the ambobus, had happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſcaped unhurt. Perceiving I could ſcarce refrain from laughing, and was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to ſpeak; ſir, ſaid he, winking upon me, I perceive you are one of us men of ſcience, and I wiſh you to ſuſpend your opinion, until a private conſultation; left our converſation may alarm the patient
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:032945_0137_0FF5EAAA40678400"/>
too much, for you know, as the learned Galen obſerves,

                        </q>
By the way, mind, theſe learned languages are apt to make the profeſſors of them ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thirſty. While the toddy was making, he proceeded. When I pondered this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilous, piteous, pertinacious, peſtiferous, petrifying caſe, I immediately thought of the directions of the learned doctors Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dibras and Mc'Fingal, not forgetting, as the wound was on the leg, the great Crookſhank's church hiſtory. When we had drunk our liquor, of which he took four fifths, by his direction a new mug was made a little ſtronger, and we retired to our conſultation.</p>
                     <p>I am much obliged to you, ſaid he, for not diſcovering my ignorance, to theſe people; though, it is ten to one, if I had not rather convinced the blockheads of
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:032945_0138_0FF5EA7796A2B938"/>
yours, if you had attempted it. A regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar bred phyſician, ſometime ſince, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted this. He declared over the ſick man's bed, that I was ignorant, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming. I replied that he was a quack; and offered to leave our pretenſions to knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, to the company, which conſiſted of a midwife, two experienced nurſes, and ſome others, not ſo eminent for learning. He quoted Cullen and Cheſſelden; and I Tully and Virgil. Until at length, when I had nearly exhauſted my ſtock of cant phraſes, and he was gaining the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our judges, I luckily bethought me of Lilly's Grammar. I began Propria quae maribus; and before I had got twenty lines, the opinion of the audience was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently in my favour. They judged naturally enough, that I was the moſt learned man, becauſe the moſt unintelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This raiſed the doctor's ire ſo much that from diſputing me, he began to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate them for a parcel of fools, ſots, and
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:032945_0139_0FF5EAAC4014EF60"/>
old women, to put their lives in the hands of ſuch an ignoramus as me. This quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decided the conteſt in my favour. The old nurſes raiſed their voices, the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife her broom ſtick, and the whole train of mob caped judges, their ſkinny fiſts, and we drove him out of the houſe in triumph. Our victory was ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, that, in the military ſtile, we did not allow him to remain on the field to bury his dead.</p>
                     <p>But it is time to tell you who I am. Sir, I drink your health. In brief, ſir, I am the ſon of a reſpectable clergyman, received a college education, entered into merchandize, failed, and, by a train of misfortunes, was obliged to commence doctor, for ſuſtenance. I ſettled myſelf in this back country. At firſt I was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to chiefly, in deſperate caſes; where no reputation is loſt, if the patient dies, and much gained, if he recovers. I have performed ſome ſurpriſing cures; but
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:032945_0140_0FF5EA791C9C62F8"/>
how I cannot tell you, except it was by allowing my patients ſmall beer, or any thing elſe they hankered after, which I have heard was ſometimes efficacious, in the criſis of a fever. But talking of drink, ſir, I wiſh your health. I believe I have never injured any perſons, by my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions. A powdered, burnt cruſt, chalk, and juice of beets and carrots are my moſt powerful medicines. We can be of mutual ſervice to each other; nurſe, another mug. We doctors find this a very difficult caſe. As I have borne down theſe country quacks, by ſuperiour effrontery, I can recommend you to full practice. I will call you to conſult with me, in difficult caſes; for, as I was ſaying, ſir, I wiſh your good health, mine are all difficult caſes; and you, in return, ſhall lend me books, and give me ſuch inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as will enable me to do good, as well as get fame and bread. The propoſal was reaſonable. I cloſed with it. He
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:032945_0141_0FF5EAB0D9201D18"/>
emptied the third mug, and we returned to our patient. When the dreſſings were removed, I diſcovered that there was not the ſlighteſt fracture of the fibula or tibia; but only a ſlight contuſion on the patula, which would perhaps not have alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any other perſon, but our patient, who was a rich old bachelor. I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended an emollient, which my learned brother acquieſced in, ſaying, with his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual air, that it was the very application he intended, having applied the garters and whalebone, merely to concoct the triſtis, the muſa and the ambobus firmly together.</p>
                     <p>A young girl, at the door, ſhewed him a wound on her elbow, which ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſtruggling about red ears at a huſking; which he gravely pronounced to be a teſtula in ano. This gentleman is really a man of abilities; has ſince made valuable acquirements in the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the human machine, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:032945_0142_0FF5EA7B26212F48"/>
medica. If he could be led to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute the aquatic draughts of Doctor Sangrado, as a ſuccedaneum for the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſible ſtimuli of Brown, he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come uſeful in the faculty, and yet ſee happy days.</p>
                     <p>The doctor kept his word. He read my books, received my inſtructions, and recommended me to his patients. But, as I copied my preceptor, in the ſimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of my language I never attempted to excite the fear of my patients, to magnify my ſkill; and could not reduce three frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured bones in a limb, which contained but two. My advice was little attended to, except when backed with that of my pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil, accompanied with frequent quotations from Lilly. He obtained all the credit of our ſucceſs; and the people generally ſuppoſed me a young man of moderate talents, whom the learned doctor might make ſomething of, in a courſe of years.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>A MERRY incident gave a perfect inſight into the practice of the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral phyſicians I have juſt eulogized. A drunken jockey, having fallen from his horſe, at a public review, was taken up ſenſeleſs, and extended upon the long ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the tavern. He ſoon recovered his breath, and groaned moſt piteouſly. As his head ſtruck the ground firſt, it was apprehended by ſome, unacquainted with its ſolidity, that he had fractured his ſkull. The faculty haſtened, from all quarters, to his aſſiſtance. The learned, ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous phyſician, after requeſting that the doors and windows might be ſhut, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:032945_0144_0FF5EA7DC6B41C38"/>
the patient; and, with a ſtately air, declined giving his opinion, as he had unfortunately left at home his Pringle on contuſions.</p>
                     <p>The cheap doctor immediately pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the wound a compound fracture, preſcribed half a doſe of crude opium, and called for the trepanning inſtruments.</p>
                     <p>The ſafe doctor propoſed brown pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, dipped in rum and cobwebs, to ſtaunch the blood. The popular phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, the muſical doctor, told us a jovial ſtory; and then ſuddenly relaxing his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, obſerved, that he viewed the groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wretch as a monument of juſtice: that he, who ſpent his days in tormenting horſes, ſhould now, by the agency of the ſame animal, be brought to death's door, an event, which he thought ought to be ſet home upon our minds by prayer.</p>
                     <p>While my new pupil, preſſing through the crowd, begged that he might ſtate the caſe to the company; and, with an audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

voice, winking upon me, began. The learned doctor Nominativo Hoc Caput, in his treatiſe on brains, obſerves that, the ſeat of the ſoul may be known, from the affections of the man. The reſidence of a wife man's ſoul is in his ears; a glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's, in his palate; a gallant's, in his lips; and old maid's, in her tongue; a dancer's, in his toes; a drunkard's, in his throat. By the way, landlord, give us a button of ſling. When we learned wiſh to know if a wound endangers life, we conſequently inquire into the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the patient, and ſee if the wound injures the ſeat of his ſoul. If that eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capes, however deep and ghaſtly the wound, we pronounce life in no danger. A horſe jockey's ſoul—gentlemen, I wiſh your healths, is in his heel, under the left ſpur. When I was purſuing my ſtudies, in the hoſpitals in England, I once ſaw ſeventeen horſe jockies, ſome of whom were noblemen, killed by the fall of a
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:032945_0146_0FF5EA7FCD8067D8"/>
ſcaffold in Newmarket, and all wounded in the heel. Twenty others, with their arms, backs, and necks broken, ſurvived. I ſaw one noble jockey, with his nominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vo caret, which is Greek for a nobleman's head, ſplit entirely open. His brains ran down his face, like the white of a broken egg; but, as his heel was unhurt, he ſurvived; and his judgment in horſes is ſaid not to be the leaſt impaired. Come, pull off the patient's boot, while I drink his better health. Charmed with the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangue, ſome of the ſpectators were about following his directions, when the other doctors interfered. They had heard him, with diſdainful impatience, and now each raiſed his voice, to ſupport his particular opinion, backed by his adherents. Bring the brown paper—compound fracture—cobwebs I ſay—hand the trepanning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments—give us ſome tod, and pull off the boot, echoed from all quarters. The landlord for bad quarrelling in his houſe.
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:032945_0147_0FF5EAB463C92200"/>
The whole company ruſhed out, to form a ring on the green, for the medical pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors; and they to a conſultation of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty cuffs. The practitioner in ſheep, horſes, and cattle, poured a doſe of urine and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes down the patient's throat; who ſoon ſo happily recovered as to purſue his vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, ſwop horſes three times, play twenty rubbers of all fours, and get dead drunk again before ſunſet.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I CARRIED a requeſt to the late Doctor Benjamin Franklin, then preſident of the ſtate of Pennſylvania, for certain papers, I was to deliver further ſouthward. I anticipated much pleaſure, from the interview with this truly great man: To ſee one, who, from ſmall beginnings, by the ſole exertion of native genius, and indefatigable induſtry, had raiſed himſelf to the pinnacle of politics and letters. a man, who, from an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble porter's boy, had elevated himſelf to be the deſirable companion of the great
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:032945_0151_0FF5EAB6EB3B8140"/>
ones of the earth: who, from trundling a wheelbarrow in bye lanes, had been advanced to paſs in ſplendour, through the courts of kings; and, from hawking vile ballads, to the contracting and ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treaties, which gave peace and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence to three millions of his fellow citizens, was a ſight intereſting in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme.</p>
                     <p>I found the doctor ſurrounded by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, moſt of whom were young people. He received me with the attention due to a young ſtranger. He diſpatched a perſon for the papers I wanted; aſked me politely to be ſeated; inquired after the family I ſprang from; and told me a pleaſing anecdote of my brave anceſtor, Captain Underhill. I found, in the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, all that ſimplicity of language, which is remarkable in the fragment of his life, publiſhed ſince his deceaſe; and which was conſpicuous in my medical precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. I have ſince been in a room a few
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:032945_0152_0FF5EA85DF009D70"/>
hours with Governour Jay, of New York; have heard of the late Governour Livingſton, of New Jerſey; and am now confirmed in the opinion, I have ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that men of genuine merit, as they poſſeſs the eſſence, need not the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade of great knowledge. A rich man is often plain in his attire, and the man, who has abundant treaſures of learning, ſimple in his manners and ſtile.</p>
                     <p>The doctor, in early life, was economi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal from principle; in his latter days, perhaps from habit. Poor Richard held the purſe ſtrings of the preſident of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania. Permit me to illuſtrate this obſervation, by an anecdote. Soon after I was introduced, an airy, thoughtleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, from a New England ſtate, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the room. It ſeems he was on a party of pleaſure, and had been ſo much involved in it, for three weeks, as not to have paid his reſpects to his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable relative. The purpoſe of his
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:032945_0153_0FF5EABC0D4F0350"/>
preſent viſit was, to ſolicit the loan of a ſmall ſum of money, to enable him to pay his bills, and tranſport himſelf home. He preluded his requeſt, with a detail of embarraſſments, which might have befal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len the moſt circumſpect. He ſaid that he had loaded a veſſel for B—, and as he did not deal on credit, had purchaſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his current caſh, and could not read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily procure a draft upon home. The doctor, inquiring how much he wanted, he replied, with ſome heſitation, fifty dollars. The benevolent old gentleman went to his eſcritoir, and counted him out an hundred. He received them with many promiſes of punctual payment, and haſtily took up the writing implements, to draught a note of hand, for the caſh. The doctor, who ſaw into the nature of the borrower's embarraſſments, better than he was aware; and was poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the improbability of ever recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering his caſh again, ſtepped acroſs the
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:032945_0154_0FF5EA87EBD540A0"/>
room, laying his hand gently upon his couſin's arm, ſaid, ſtop couſin, we will ſave the paper; a quarter of a ſheet is not of great value, but it is worth ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: conveying, at once, a liberal gift and gentle reprimand for the borrower's prevarication and extravagance. Since I am talking of Franklin, the reader may be as unwilling to leave him as I was. Allow me to relate another anecdote. I do not recollect how the converſation was introduced; but a young perſon in company, mentioned his ſurprize, that the poſſeſſion of great riches ſhould ever be attended with ſuch anxiety and ſolic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude; and inſtanced Mr. R—M—, who, he ſaid, though in poſſeſſion of unbound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wealth, yet was as buſy and more anxious, than the moſt aſſiduous clerk in his counting houſe. The doctor took an apple from a fruit baſket, and preſented it to a little child, who could juſt totter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the room. The child could ſcarce
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:032945_0155_0FF5EABA879AE640"/>
graſp it in his hand. He then gave it another, which occupied the other hand. Then chooſing a third, remarkable for its ſize and beauty, he preſented that alſo. The child, after many ineffectual attempts to hold the three, dropped the laſt on the carpet, and burſt into tears. See there, ſaid the philoſopher; there is a little man, with more riches than he can en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN one of the ſtates, ſouthward of Philadelphia, I was invited, on a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, to go to church. I will not ſay which, as I am loth to offend; and our faſhionable fellow citizens of the ſouth arm of the union may not think divine ſervice any credit to them. My friend apologized for inviting me to ſo hum
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:032945_0157_0FF5EABF28EB4FB0"/>
drum an amuſement, by aſſuring me, that immediately after ſervice, there was to be a famous match run for a purſe of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars, beſides private bets, between 'Squire L's imported horſe, Slammerkin, and Colonel F's bay mare, Jenny Driver. When we arrived at the church, we found a brilliant collection of well dreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, anxiouſly waiting the arrival of the parſon, who, it ſeems, had a ſmall branch of the river M—to paſs; and, we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards learned, was detained by the abſence of his negro boy, who was to fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him over. Soon after, our impatience was relieved, by the arrival of the parſon, in his canonicals: a young man, not of the moſt mortified countenance, who, with a ſwitch, called ſupple jack, in his hand, belaboured the back and head of the faulty ſlave, all the way from the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the church door; accompanying every ſtroke, with ſuitable language. He entered the church, and we followed.
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:032945_0158_0FF5EA8B7B357498"/>
He aſcended the reading deſk, and, with his face glowing with the exerciſe of his ſupple jack, began the ſervice with, I ſaid I will take heed unto my ways, that I ſin not with my tongue. I will keep my tongue as it were with a bridle, when I am before the wicked. When I muſed the fire burned within me, and I ſpake with my tongue, &amp;c. &amp;c. He preached an ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated diſcourſe, of eleven minutes, upon the practical duties of religion, from theſe words, remember the ſabbath day, to keep it holy; and read the fourth commandment, in the communion. The whole congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation prayed fervently, that their hearts might be inclined to keep this holy law. The bleſſing was pronounced; and parſon and people haſtened to the horſe race. I found the parſon as much reſpected on the turf, as upon the haſſoc. He was one of the judges of the race; deſcanted, in the language of the turf, upon the points of the two rival horſes, and the
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:032945_0159_0FF5EAC12B225008"/>
ſleeve of his caſſoc was heavy laden, with the principal bets. The confidence of his pariſhioners was not ill founded; for they aſſured me, upon oath and honour, that he was a gentleman, of as much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs as his grace the archbiſhop of Canterbury. Ay, they would ſport him for a ſermon or a ſong, againſt any parſon in the union.</p>
                     <p>The whole of this extraordinary ſcene was novel to me. Beſides, a certain ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of New England I had with me, call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſcience, made my ſituation, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the paſſive part I bore in it, ſo awkward and uneaſy, that I could not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain from obſerving to my friend my ſurpriſe at the parſon's conduct, in chaſtiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſervant immediately before divine ſervice. My friend was ſo happily influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the habits of theſe liberal, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened people, that he could not even comprehend the tendency of my remark. He ſuppoſed it levelled at the improprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:032945_0160_0FF5EA8E0B431E20"/>
not of the miniſter, but the man; not at the act, but the ſeverity of the chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and obſerved, with warmth, that the parſon ſerved the villain right, and, that if he had been his ſlave, he would have killed the black raſcal, if he was ſure he ſhould have to pay an hundred guin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eas to the public treaſury for him. I will note here, that the reader is requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whenever he meets with quotations of ſpeeches, in the above ſcenes, excepting thoſe during divine ſervice, that he will pleaſe, that is, if his habits of life will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, to interlard thoſe quotations with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout as many oaths, as they contain mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſylables. He may reſt aſſured, that it will render the ſcene abundantly more natural. It is true, I might have inſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them myſelf, and ſupported thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by illuſtrations and parodies from grave authors; but I never ſwear pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanely myſelf, and I think it almoſt as bad to oblige my readers to purchaſe the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precations
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:032945_0161_0FF5EAC2AFD0D458"/>
of others. I give this hint of the introduction of oaths, for the benefit of my readers to the ſouthward of Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia; who, however they may enjoy a ſcene, which reflects ſuch honour upon their country, when ſeaſoned with theſe palatable expletives, without them perhaps would eſteem it as taſteleſs and vapid, as a game at cards or billiards, without bets; or boiled veal or turkey, without ham.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I FOUND the ſouthern ſtates not more engaging, to a young practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, than the northern. In the ſea ports of both, the buſineſs was engroſſed by men of eſtabliſhed practice and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence. In the interiour country, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple could not diſtinguiſh, or encourage merit. The gains were ſmall, and tardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly collected; and, in both wings of the union, and I believe every where elſe,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:032945_0163_0FF5EAC4CA32AC08"/>
fortune and fame are generally to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the learned profeſſions, ſolely, by a patient, undeviating application to local buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>If diſſipation could have afforded pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, to a mind yearning after profeſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al fame and independence, I might, ſo long as my money laſted, have been hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, at the ſouthward. I was often invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the turf; and, might have had the honour of being intoxicated frequently, with the moſt reſpectable characters. An aſſociation with the well educated of the other ſex was not ſo readily attained. There was a haughty reſerve, in the manners of the young ladies. Every attempt at familiarity, in a young ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, habituated to the ſocial, but reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful intercourſe, cuſtomary in the northern ſtates, excited alarm. With my New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ideas, I could not help viewing, in the anxious efforts of their parents and relatives, to repel every approach to innocent and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:032945_0164_0FF5EA91A1273E60"/>
chaſtened intercourſe, a ſtrong ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of that virtue, they were ſolicitous to protect.</p>
                     <p>Depreſſed by the gloomy view of my proſpects; and determined never to face my parents again, under circumſtances, which would be burthenſome to them, I attempted to obtain practice in the town of F—, in Virginia, but in vain. The very decorum, prudence, and economy, which would have enhanced my charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at home, were here conſtrued into poverty of ſpirit. To obtain medical practice, it was expedient, to ſport, bet, drink, ſwear, &amp;c. with my patients. My purſe forbad the former; my habits of life the latter. My caſh waſted, and I was near ſuffering. I was obliged to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of my books, for preſent ſubſiſtance; and, in that country, books were not the prime articles of commerce. To avoid ſtarving, I again contemplated keeping a ſchool. In that country, knowledge was
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:032945_0165_0FF5EAC75F3FB9B0"/>
viewed as a handicraft trade. The ſchool maſters, before the war, had been uſually collected from unfortunate European youth, of ſome ſchool learning, ſold for their paſſage into America. So that to purchaſe a ſchool maſter and a negro was almoſt ſynonimous. Mr. J—n, and ſome other citizens of the world, who had been caſt among them, had by their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, influence, and example, brought the knowledge of letters into ſome repute, ſince the revolution; but, I believe, thoſe excellent men have yet to lament the general inefficacy of their liberal efforts. This ſtatement, and my own prior expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience in ſchool keeping, would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me rather to have prefered la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring, with the ſlaves on their planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than ſuſtaining the ſlavery and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of a ſchool.</p>
                     <p>When reduced to my laſt dollar; and beginning to ſuffer, from the embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of debt, I was invited, by a ſea
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:032945_0166_0FF5EA93AEA19388"/>
captain, who knew my friends, to accept the birth of ſurgeon, in his ſhip. Every new purſuit has its flattering proſpects. I was encouraged by handſome wages, and a privilege in the ſhip, to carry an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture; for the purchaſe of which, the owners were to advance me, on account of my pay. I was to be companion to the captain, and have a fine chance of ſeeing the world. To quit my home, for all parts of the union I conſidered as home; to tempt the perilous ocean, and encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſeverities of a ſea faring life, the diſeaſes of torrid climes, and perhaps a total ſeparation from my friends and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, was melancholy; but the deſire to ſee the world, to acquire practical knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, in my profeſſion, to obtain proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, added to the neceſſity of immediate ſubſiſtance, and the horrours of a jail, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined me to accept his offer. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly entered ſurgeon, on board the ſhip Freedom, Captain Sidney Ruſſell
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:032945_0167_0FF5EAE5ECEA8130"/>
commander, freighted with tobacco, bound to London, and thence to the coaſt of Africa. I had little to do in my paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to London. My deſtination, as a ſurgeon, being principally in the voyage from that city to the African coaſt, and thence to the Weſt Indies; and, if I had not ſuffered from a previous nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea or ſea ſickneſs, the novelty of the ſcene would have rendered me tolerably happy. In the perturbation of my thoughts, I had omitted writing to my parents of the places of my deſtination. This careleſs omiſſion afterwards, cauſed them and me much trouble. We ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſafely in the Downs.</p>

the other inſignia of Britiſh royalty, of which Engliſhmen are ſo juſtly proud, I ſhall content myſelf, with mentioning the moſt ſingular curioſity, I ſaw in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. It was the celebrated Thomas Paine, author of Common Senſe, the Rights of Man, and other writings, whoſe tendency is to overturn ancient opinions of government and religion.</p>
                     <p>I met this intereſting perſonage, at the lodgings of the ſon of a late patriotic A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican governour; whoſe genius, in the fine art of hiſtorical painting, whoſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie at Gibralter, whoſe flowing drapery, faithful and bold expreſſion, in the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits of our beloved preſident, and other leaders, both military and political, in our glorious revolution; when the love of the fine arts ſhall be diſſeminated in our land, will leave poſterity to regret and admire the imbecility of contemporary patronage.</p>
                     <p>Thomas Paine reſembled the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle to the Gentiles, not more in his
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:032945_0173_0FF5EACAED0AFD98"/>
zeal and ſubtlety of argument, than in perſonal appearance; for, like that fervid apoſtle, his bodily preſence was both mean and contemptible. When I ſaw him, he was dreſſed in a ſnuff coloured coat, olive velvet veſt, drab breeches, coarſe hoſe. His ſhoe buckles of the ſize of half a dollar. A bob tailed wig cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered that head, which worked ſuch mic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle woe to courts and kings. If I ſhould attempt to deſcribe it, it would be in the ſame ſtile and principle, with which the veteran ſoldier bepraiſeth an old ſtandard: the more tattered, the more glorious. It is probable that this was the ſame identical wig, under the ſhadow of whoſe curls, he wrote Common Senſe in America, many years before. He was a ſpare man, rather under ſize; ſubject to the extreme of low, and highly exhilirat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirits; often ſat reſerved in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; ſeldom mingled in common chit chat. But when a man of ſenſe and elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution

                        <p>Curious Argument, between Thomas Paine and the noted Peter Pindar: Peter ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth a Wit Nooſe, and catcheth Thomas, in one of his own Logic Traps.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I HEARD Thomas Paine once aſſert, in the preſence of Mr. Wolcott, better known, in this country, by the face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious name of Peter Pindar, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority, in all deliberative bodies, ought, in all caſes, to govern the majority. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſmiled. You muſt grant me, ſaid Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Senſe, that the proportion of
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:032945_0176_0FF5EAFCB000E508"/>
men of ſenſe, to the ignorant among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, is at leaſt as twenty, thirty, or even forty nine, to an hundred. The majority of mankind are conſequently moſt prone to errour; and, if we would atchieve right, the minority ought, in all caſes, to govern. Peter continued to ſmile archly. If we look to experience, continued Paine, for there are no concluſions I more prize than thoſe drawn, not from ſpeculation, but plain matter of fact, we ſhall find an examination into the debates of all delib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erative bodies, in our favour. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther than your country, Mr. Wolcott, I love to look at home. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the reſolutions of the houſes of lords and commons had been determined by this ſalutary rule; why, the ſenſible mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nority would have governed. George Waſhington would have been a private citizen; and the United States of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca mere colonies, dependent on the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh crown. As a patriotic Engliſhman,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:032945_0177_0FF5EACF8E1D24D8"/>
will you not confeſs, that this would have been better than to have theſe United States independent, with the illuſtrious Waſhington at their head, by their wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom confounding the juggling efforts of your miniſtry to embroil them; and to have the comfortable proſpect before you, that from the extent of their territory, their maritime reſource, their natural en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, the aſylum they offer to emigrants, in the courſe of two centuries, Scotland and Ireland, if the United States have not too much real pride to attempt it, may be reduced to the ſame dependence upon them, as your Weſt India iſlands now have upon you: and even England, haughty England, thrown in as a make weight, in the future treaty between them and the French nation. Peter, who had liſtened with great ſeeming attention, now mildly replied. I will not ſay but that your arguments are cogent, though not entirely convincing. As it is a ſubject
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:032945_0178_0FF5EAFE51FC1870"/>
rather out of my line, I will, for form ſake, hold the negative of your propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and leave it to the good company, which is right. Agreed, ſaid Paine, who ſaw himſelf ſurrounded by his admirers. Well, gentlemen, ſaid Peter, with all the gravity of a ſpeaker of the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; you, that are of the opinion that the minority, in all deliberative bodies, ought, in all caſes, to govern the majority, pleaſe to riſe in the affirmative. Paine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſtood up himſelf, and, as he had foreſeen, we all roſe in his favour. Then I riſe in the negative, cried Peter. I am the wiſe minority, who ought, in all caſes, to govern your ignorant majority; and, conſequently, upon your own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, I carry the vote. Let it be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded.</p>
                     <p>This unexpected manoeuvre raiſed a hearty laugh. Paine retired from the preſence of triumphant wit, mortified with being foiled at his own weapons.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IN the frequent interviews I had with this celebrated republican apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, I never heard him expreſs the leaſt doubt of, or caſt the ſmalleſt reflection upon revealed religion. He ſpake of the glowing expreſſions of the Jewiſh prophets with fervour; and had quoted liberally from the ſcriptures, in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:032945_0180_0FF5EB01812895C8"/>
Senſe. How he came to write that unreaſonable little pamphlet, called the Age of Reaſon, I am at a loſs to conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The probable opinion attributes it to his paſſion for paradox; that this ſmall morſel of infidelity was offered as a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to ſave his life from the devouring cruelty of Roberſpierre, that Moloch of the French nation. It probably had its deſired effect; for annihilating reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion could not but afford a diabol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical pleaſure, to that ferocious wretch and his inhuman aſſociates, who could not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect a ſanction for their cruelties, while the leaſt veſtige of any thing ſacred remained among men.</p>
                     <p>When the reign of the terroriſts ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, an apology was expected; and, even by the pious, yet catholic American, would have been received. To the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended religion of his country no propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory ſacrifice was made. This miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary of vice has proceeded proſelyting.
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:032945_0181_0FF5EAD33270D398"/>
He has added ſecond parts, and made other, and audacious adjuncts to deiſm. No might nor greatneſs eſcapes him. He has vilified a great prophet, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Gentiles; he has railed at Waſhington, a ſaviour of his country. A taſteful, though irreligious ſcholar might tolerate a chaſtiſed ſcepticiſm, if exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an acute Hume, or an eloquent Boling broke. But one cannot repreſs the irritability of the fiery Hotſpur, when one beholds the pillars of morality ſhaken by the rude ſhock of this modern vandal. The reader ſhould learn, that his paltry ſyſtem is only an <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Johnſon, a reſpectable bookſeller in St. Paul's church yard, London, has aſſerted that Mr. Paine's tongue uſed to flow moſt freely againſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed religion, when he was moſt intoxicated with "ale, or vilerliquors."</note>outrage of wine; and that it is in the ale houſe, he moſt vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſaults the authority of the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets,

                     </argument>
                     <p>ON the eighteenth of July, one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty eight, I received orders, from my captain, to join the ſhip in the Downs. I accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly took paſſage in a poſt chaiſe; and, after a rapid journey of ſeventy four miles, arrived, the ſame afternoon at Deal; and the next morning entered as ſurgeon, on board the ſhip Sympathy, of three hundred tons, and thirty eight men,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:032945_0184_0FF5EB0730D8BED8"/>
Captain Sydney Ruſſell commander; bound to the coaſt of Africa, thence to Barbadoes, and to South Carolina with a cargo of ſlaves.</p>
                     <p>We were favoured with a clear ſky and pleaſant gales; and, after a ſhort and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable voyage, we touched at Porto San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, one of the Madeira iſles; where we watered and ſupplied ourſelves with freſh proviſions in abundance, to which the captain added, at my requeſt, a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Madeira, malmſey, and tent wines, for the ſick. We had a fine run, from the Madeiras to the Canary iſles. The morning after we ſailed, I was highly gratified with a full view of the iſland and peak of Teneriff; which made its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance the day before, riſing above the ocean, at one hundred miles diſtance. We anchored off Fuertuventura one of the Canaries, in a good bottom. I went on ſhore, with the mate, to procure green vegetables; as I ever eſteemed them the
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:032945_0185_0FF5EAD6C804A878"/>
ſpecific for that dreadful ſea diſorder, the ſcurvy. Before we had reached the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deiras, though I had ſtored our medicine cheſt with the beſt antiſcorbutics, and we had a plenty of dried vegetables on board, yet the ſcurvy had began to infect us. A plentiful diſtribution of green veg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etables, after our arrival at Porto Santo, ſoon expelled it from the crew. At Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertuventura, I was delighted with the wild notes of the Canary bird, far ſurpaſſing the moſt excellent of thoſe I had ſeen in cages, in the United States.</p>
                     <p>I was anxious to viſit the Cape de Verd iſlands; but, our courſe being too far eaſt, we ran down to the little iſland of Coree, to which the contentious of the Engliſh and French crowns have annexed its only importance. The French officers received us with politeneſs, and were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely anxious for news, from their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent country. Soon after, we dropt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor off Loango city, upon a ſmall
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:032945_0186_0FF5EB051CC17728"/>
well peopled iſland, near the coaſt of Congo or lower Guinea, in poſſeſſion of the Portugueſe. Our captain carried his papers on ſhore, and, the next day, weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed anchor and ſtood in for the continent. All hands were now employed to unlade the ſhip, and the cargo was depoſited in a Portugueſe factory, at a place called Cacongo, near the mouth of the river <hi>Zaire.</hi> The day after our arrival at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>congo, ſeveral Portugueſe and Negro mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, hardly diſtinguiſhable however, by their manners, employments, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, came to confer with the captain, about the purchaſe of our cargo of ſlaves. They contracted to deliver him two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty head of ſlaves, in fifteen days' time. To hear theſe men converſe upon the purchaſe of human beings, with the ſame indifference, and nearly in the ſame language, as if they were contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſo many head of cattle or ſwine, ſhocked me exceedingly. But, when I
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:032945_0187_0FF5EADA28FF1248"/>
ſuffered my imagination to rove to the habitation of theſe victims to this infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, cruel commerce, and fancied that I ſaw the peaceful huſbandman dragged from his native farm; the fond huſband torn from the embraces of his belov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wife; the mother, from her babes; the tender child, from the arms of its pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent; and all the tender, endearing ties of natural and ſocial affection rended by the hand of avaricious violence, my heart ſunk within me. I execrated myſelf, for even the involuntary part I bore in this execrable traffic: I thought of my native land and bluſhed. When the captain kindly inquired of me how many ſlaves I thought my privilege in the ſhip entitled me to tranſport, for my adventure, I reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my privilege, with horrour; and declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed I would ſooner ſuffer ſervitude than purchaſe a ſlave. This obſervation was received in the great cabin with repeated burſts of laughter, and excited many a
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:032945_0188_0FF5EB09C93B8A68"/>
ſtroke of coarſe ridicule. Captain Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell obſerved, that he would not inſiſt upon my uſing my privilege, if I had ſo much of the yankee about me. Here is my clerk, Ned Randolph, will jump at the chance; though the rogue has been rather unlucky in the trade. Out of five and twenty negroes he purchaſed, he nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er carried but one alive to port; and that poor devil was broken winded, and he was obliged to ſell him for half price in Antigua.</p>
                     <p>Punctual to the day of the delivery, the contractors appeared, and brought with them about one hundred and fifty negroes, men, women, and children. The men were faſtened together, in pairs, by a bar of iron, with a collar to receive the neck at each extremity; a long pole paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over their ſhoulder, and between each two, bound by a ſtaple and ring, through which the pole was thruſt, and thus twenty, and ſometimes thirty, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:032945_0189_0FF5EADBAD22A060"/>
together; while their conductors inceſſantly applied the ſcourge to thoſe, who loitered, or ſought to ſtrangle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, by lifting their feet from the ground in deſpair, which ſometimes had been ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully attempted. The women and children were bound with cords, and driven forward by the whip. When they arrived at the factory, the men were unlooſed from the poles; but ſtill chain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in pairs, and turned into ſtrong cells, built for the purpoſe. The dumb ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row of ſome, the frenzy of others, the ſobbings and tears of the children, and ſhrieks of the women, when they were preſented to our captain, ſo affected me that I was haſtening from this ſcene of barbarity, on board the ſhip; when I was called by the mate, and diſcovered, to my ſurprize and horrour, that, by my ſtation in the ſhip, I had a principal and active part of this inhuman tranſaction impoſed upon me. As ſurgeon, it was my duty to
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:032945_0190_0FF5EB0BD886CF00"/>
inſpect the bodies of the ſlaves, to ſee, as the captain expreſſed himſelf, that our owners were not ſhammed off with unſound fleſh. In this inſpection, I was aſſiſted by Randolph the clerk, and two ſtout ſailors. It was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted with all that unfeeling inſolence, which wanton barbarity can inflict up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on defenceleſs wretchedneſs. The man, the affrighted child, the modeſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, and the timid virgin were alike expoſed to this ſevere ſcrutiny, to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and common decency equally inſulting.</p>
                     <p>I cannot reflect on this tranſaction yet without ſhuddering. I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored my conduct with tears of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh; and, I pray a merciful God, the common parent of the great family of the univerſe, who hath made of one fleſh and one blood all nations of the earth, that the miſeries, the inſults, and cruel wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, I afterwards received, when a ſlave

                     </argument>
                     <p>OF one hundred and fifty Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans we rejected ſeventeen, as not mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantable. While I was doubting which to lament moſt, thoſe, who were about being precipitated into all the miſeries of an American ſlavery, or thoſe, whom we had rejected, as too wretched for ſlaves; Captain Ruſſell was congratulating the ſlave contractors, upon the immenſe good luck they had, in not ſuffering more by this lot of human creatures. I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:032945_0193_0FF5EADF4773B318"/>
that, what from wounds received by ſome of theſe miſerable creatures, at their capture, or in their violent ſtruggles for liberty, or attempts at ſuicide; with the fatigue of a long journey, partly over the burning ſands of a ſultry climate, it was uſual to eſtimate the loſs, in the paſſage to the ſea ſhore, at twenty five per cent.</p>
                     <p>No ſooner was the purchaſe complet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than theſe wretched Africans were tranſported in herds aboard the ſhip, and immediately precipitated between decks, where a ſtrong chain, attached to a ſtaple in the lower deck, was rivetted to the bar, before deſcribed; and then the men were chained in pairs, and alſo hand cuffed, and two ſailors with cutlaſſes guarded ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery twenty: while the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were tied together in pairs with ropes, and obliged to ſupply the men with proviſions, and the fluſh bucket; or, if the young women were releaſed, it was only to gratify the brutal luſt of the ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors;
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:032945_0194_0FF5EB0F6E7D0810"/>
for though I cannot ſay I ever was witneſs to an actual rape, yet the frequent ſhrieks of theſe forlorn females in the births of the ſeamen, left me little charity to doubt of the repeated commiſſion of that degrading crime. The eve after we had received the ſlaves on board, all hands were piped on deck, and ordered to aſſiſt in manufacturing and knotting cat o'nine tails, the application of which, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, was always neceſſary to bring the ſlaves to their appetite. The night after they came on board was ſpent by theſe wretched people, in ſobbings, groans, tears, and the moſt heart rending burſts of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and deſpair. The next morning all was ſtill. Surpriſed by this unexpected ſilence, I almoſt hoped that providence, in pity to theſe her miſerable children, had permitted ſome kindly ſuffocation to put a period to their anguiſh. It was neither novel nor unexpected to the ſhip's crew. It is only the dumb fit come on, cried
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:032945_0195_0FF5EAE25D9B1618"/>
every one. We will cure them. After breakfaſt, the whole ſhip's crew went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween decks, and carried with them the proviſions for the ſlaves, which they one and all refuſed to eat. A more affecting group of miſery was never ſeen. Theſe injured Africans, prefering death to ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or perhaps buoyed above the fear of diſſolution, by their religion, which taught them to look with an eye of faith to a country beyond the grave; where they ſhould again meet thoſe friends and relatives, from whoſe endearments they had been torn; and where no fiend ſhould torment, or chriſtian thirſt for gold, had, wanting other means, reſolved to ſtarve themſelves, and every eye low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the fixed reſolve of this deadly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. In vain were the men beaten. They refuſed to taſte one mouthful; and, I believe, would have died under the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration, if the ingenious cruelty of the clerk, Randolph, had not ſuggeſted the
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:032945_0196_0FF5EB1202B3AE50"/>
plan of whipping the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in ſight of the men; aſſuring the men they ſhould be tormented until all had eaten. What the torments, exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the bodies of theſe brave Africans, failed to produce, the feelings of nature effected. The Negro, who could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dauntedly expire under the anguiſh of the laſh, could not view the agonies of his wife, child, or his mother; and, though repeatedly encouraged by theſe female ſufferers, unmoved by their torments, to perſevere unto death; yet, though the <hi>man</hi> dared to die, the <hi>father</hi> relented, and in a few hours they all eat their proviſions, <hi>mingled with their tears.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Our ſlave dealers being unable to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil their contract, unleſs we tarried three weeks longer, our captain concluded to remove to ſome other market. We ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly weighed anchor, and ſteered for Benin, and anchored in the river Formoſa, where we took in one hundred and fifteen
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:032945_0197_0FF5EAE3E3996F10"/>
more ſlaves. The ſame proceſs in the purchaſe was purſued here; and, though I frequently aſſured the captain, as a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, that it was impracticable to ſtow fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty more perſons between decks, without endangering health and life, the whole hundred and fifteen were thruſt, with the reſt, between decks. The ſtagnant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined air of this infernal hole, rendered more deleterious by the ſtench of the fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and violent perſpiration of ſuch a crowd, occaſioned putrid diſeaſes; and, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven while in the mouth of the Formoſa, it was uſual to throw one or two Negro corpſes over every day. It was in vain I remonſtrated to the captain. In vain I enforced the neceſſity of more commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous births, and a more free influx of air for the ſlaves. In vain I repreſented, that theſe miſerable people had been uſed to the vegetable diet, and pure air of a country life. That at home they were remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for cleanlineſs of perſon, the very rites
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:032945_0198_0FF5EB14142764B0"/>
of their religion conſiſting, almoſt entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in frequent ablutions. The captain was, by this time, prejudiced againſt me. He obſerved that he did not doubt my ſkill, and would be bound by my advice, as to the health of thoſe on board his ſhip, when he found I was actuated by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the owners; but, he feared, that I was now moved by ſome <hi>yankee non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe about humanity.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Randolph, the clerk, blamed me in plain terms. He ſaid he had made ſeven African voyages, and with as good ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons as I was; and that it was their common practice, when an infectious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order prevailed, among the ſlaves, to make critical ſearch for all thoſe, who had the ſlighteſt ſymptoms of it, or whoſe habits of body inclined them to it; to tie them up and caſt them over the ſhip ſide together, and thus, at one daſh, to purify the ſhip. <hi>What ſignifies, added he, the lives of the black devils; they love to die. You
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:032945_0199_0FF5EAE889B58CC8"/>
cannot pleaſe them better, than by chucking them into the water.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When we ſtood out to ſea, the rolling of the veſſel brought on the ſea ſickneſs, which encreaſed the filth; the weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er being rough, we were obliged to cloſe ſome of the ports, which ventilated the ſpace between decks; and death raged dreadfully among the ſlaves. Above two thirds were diſeaſed. It was affecting to obſerve the ghaſtly ſmile on the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the dying African, as if rejoic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to eſcape the cruelty of his oppreſſors. I noticed one man, who gathered all his ſtrength, and, in one laſt effort, ſpoke with great emphaſis, and expired. I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, by the linguiſt, that, with his dying breath, he invited his wife, and a boy and girl to follow him quickly, and ſlaken their thirſt with him at the cool ſtreams of the fountain of their Great Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the reach of the wild white beaſts. The captain was now alarmed for the
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:032945_0200_0FF5EB159A3F3918"/>
ſucceſs of his voyage; and, upon my urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſity of landing the ſlaves, he ordered the ſhip about, and we anchored near an uninhabited part of the gold coaſt. I conjecture not far from Cape St. Paul.</p>
                     <p>Tents were erected on the ſhore, and the ſick landed. Under my direction, they recovered ſurpriſingly. It was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to ſee the effect gentle uſage had upon theſe hitherto ſullen, obſtinate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. As I had the ſole direction of the hoſpital, they looked on me as the ſource of this ſudden tranſition from the filth and rigour of the ſhip, to the cleanlineſs and kindneſs of the ſhore. Their gratitude was exceſſive. When they recovered ſo far as to walk out, happy was he, who could, by picking a few berries, gathering the wild fruits of the country, or doing any menial ſervices, manifeſt his affection for me. Our linguiſt has told me, he has often heard them, behind the
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:032945_0201_0FF5C40C68CDBD60"/>
buſhes, praying to their God for my proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and aſking him with earneſtneſs, why he put my good <hi>black</hi> ſoul into a <hi>white</hi> body. In twelve days all the convaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents were returned to the ſhip, except five, who ſtaid with me on ſhore, and were to be taken on board the next day.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>NEAR the cloſe of the fourteenth of November, one thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and eighty eight, as the ſun was ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing behind the mountains of Fundia, I ſat at the door of my tent, and perceived our ſhip, which lay at one mile's diſtance, getting under way, apparently in great haſte. The jolly boat, about ten min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes before, had made towards the ſhore; but was recalled by a muſket ſhot from the ſhip. Alarmed by this unexpected manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vre, I ran to the top of a ſmall hill, back of the hoſpital, and plainly diſcovered a ſquare rigged veſſel in the offing, endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouring
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:032945_0203_0FF5EAEA8E3E29F8"/>
to lock our ſhip within the land; but a land breeze ſpringing up from the north eaſt, which did not extend to the ſtrange veſſel, and our ſhip putting out all her light ſails, being well provided with king ſail, ſcudding ſails, water ſails, and driver, I could perceive ſhe out ſailed her. It was ſoon ſo dark that I loſt ſight of both, and I paſſed a night of extreme anxiety, which was increaſed by, what I conjectured to be, the flaſhes of guns in the <hi>ſouth weſt;</hi> though at too great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for me to hear the reports.</p>
                     <p>The next morning no veſſels were to be ſeen on the coaſt, and the enſuing day was ſpent in a ſtate of dreadful ſuſpenſe. Although I had proviſions enough with me for ſome weeks, and was ſheltered by our tents, yet to be ſeparated from my friends and country, perhaps forever, and to fall into the hands of the barbarous people, which infeſted this coaſt, was tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alarming. The five Africans, who
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:032945_0204_0FF5EB19CDA898E8"/>
were with me, could not conceal their joy, at the departure of the ſhip. By ſigns they manifeſted their affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me; and, when I ſignified to them that the veſſel was gone not to return, they clapped their hands, and pointing inland, ſignified a deſire to convey me to their native country, where they were ſure I ſhould be happy. By their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, I could ſee that they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally ignorant of the way. On the third day towards evening, to my great joy, I ſaw a ſail approaching the ſhore, at the proſpect of which my African aſſociates, manifeſted every ſign of horrour. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concluded that no great blame would ariſe, from my not detaining five men, in the abſence of the ſhip; and I intimated to them that they might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal themſelves in the bruſh and eſcape. Four quitted me; but one, who made me comprehend, that he had a beloved ſon among the ſlaves, refuſed to go, prefering
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:032945_0205_0FF5EAEC1C9F50F8"/>
the company of his child, and <hi>ſlavery</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to <hi>freedom</hi> and the land of his nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I retired to reſt, pleaſed with the imagination of ſoon rejoining my friends, and proceeding to my native country. On the morning of the fourth day, as I was ſleeping in my tent with the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate negro at my feet, I was ſuddenly awakened, by the blowing of conch ſhells, and the ſound of uncouth voices. I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe to dreſs myſelf, when the tent was overſet, and I received a blow from the back of a ſabre, which levelled me to the earth; and was immediately ſeized and bound by ſeveral men of ſallow and fierce demeanour, in ſtrange habits, who ſpake a language I could not compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend. With the negro, tents, baggage, and proviſions, I was carried to the boat, which, being loaded, was immediately puſhed off from the ſhore, and rowed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a veſſel, which I now, for the firſt time, noticed, and had no doubt but it was
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:032945_0206_0FF5EB1C605D2418"/>
the ſame, which was in purſuit of the Sympathy. She was rigged differently from any I had ever ſeen, having two maſts, a large ſquare main ſail, another of equal ſize, ſeized by the middle of a main yard to her fore maſt, and, what the ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors call, a ſhoulder of mutton ſail abaft; which, with top ſails and two banks of oars, impelled her through the water with amazing velocity: though, from the clumſineſs of her rigging, an American ſeaman would never have pronounced her a good ſea boat. On her main maſt head was a broad black pennant, with a half moon, or rather creſcent, and a drawn ſabre, in white and red, emblazoned in the middle. The ſides of the veſſel were manned as we approached, and a tackle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let down, the hook was attached to the cord, which bound me, and I was hoiſted on board in the twinkling of an eye. Then, being unbound, I was carried upon the quarter deck, where a man, who
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:032945_0207_0FF5EAEDA1516758"/>
appeared to be the captain, glittering in ſilks, pearl, and gold, ſet croſs legged upon a velvet cuſhing to receive me. He was nearly encircled by a band of men, with monſtrous tufts of hair on their upper lips, dreſſed in habits of the ſame mode with their leader's, but of coarſer contex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, with drawn ſcimitars in their hands, and by his ſide a man of lighter complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, who, by the captain's command, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of me, in good Engliſh, if I was an Engliſhman. I replied I was an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican, a citizen of the United States. This was no ſooner interpreted to the captain than, at a diſdainful nod of his head, I was again ſeized, hand cuffed, and thruſt into a dirty hole in the fore caſtle, where I lay twenty four hours, without ſtraw to ſleep on, or any thing to eat or drink. The treatment we gave the unhappy Africans, on board the Sympathy, now came full into my mind; and, what was the more mortifying, I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:032945_0208_0FF5EB1FEE39D8D8"/>
that the negro who was, captured with me, was at liberty, and fared as well as the ſailors on board the veſſel. I had not however been confined more than one half hour, when the interpreter came to examine me privately reſpecting the deſtination of the ſhip, to which he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected I belonged; was anxious to know if ſhe had her full cargo of ſlaves; what was her force; whether ſhe had Engliſh papers on board; and if ſhe did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſtop at ſome other African port. From him I learned that I was cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured by an Algerine Rover, Hamed Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Saad captain; and ſhould be carried into ſlavery at Algiers. After I had lain twenty four hours in this loathſome place, covered with vermin, parched with thirſt, and fainting with hunger, I was ſtartled at a light, let through the hatchway, which opened ſoftly, and a hand preſented me a cloth, dripping with cold water, in which a ſmall quantity of boiled rice was
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:032945_0209_0FF5EAF0C9392908"/>
wrapped. The door cloſed again ſoftly, and I was left to enjoy my good fortune in the dark. If Abraham had indeed ſent Lazarus to the rich man, in torment, it appears to me, he could not have received a greater pleaſure, from the cool water on his tongue, than I experienced, in ſucking the moiſture from this cloth. The next day, the ſame kindly hand ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared again, with the ſame refreſhment. I begged to ſee my benefactor. The door opened further, and I ſaw a countenance in tears. It was the face of the grateful African, who was taken with me. I was oppreſſed with gratitude. Is this, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed I, one of thoſe men, whom we are taught to vilify as beneath the human ſpecies, who brings me ſuſtenance, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at the riſk of his life, who ſhares his morſel with one of thoſe barbarous men, who had recently torn him from all he held dear, and whoſe baſe companions are now tranſporting his darling ſon to
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:032945_0210_0FF5EB1DE4ED23E8"/>
a grievous ſlavery? Grant me, I ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, once more to taſte the freedom of my native country, and every moment of my life ſhall be dedicated to preaching againſt this deteſtable commerce. I will fly to our fellow citizens in the ſouthern ſtates; I will, on my knees, conjure them, in the name of humanity, to aboliſh a trafic, which cauſes it to bleed in every pore. If they are deaf to the pleadings of nature, I will conjure them, for the ſake of conſiſtency, to ceaſe to deprive their fellow creatures of freedom, which their writers, their orators, repreſentatives, ſenators, and even their conſtitutions of government, have declared to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable birth right of man. My ſable friend had no occaſion to viſit me a third time; for I was taken from my confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, after being ſtripped of the few clothes, and the little property I chanced to have about me, a log was faſtened to my leg by a chain, and I was permitted
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:032945_0211_0FF5EAF2DC0C7F08"/>
to walk the fore caſtle of the veſſel, with the African and ſeveral Spaniſh and Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe priſoners. The treatment of the ſlaves, who plied the oars, the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of the veſſel, the order which was obſerved among this ferocious race, and ſome notices of our voyage, might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford obſervations, which would be highly gratifying to my readers, if the limits of this work would permit. I will juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve however that the regularity and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of their devotion was aſtoniſhing to me, who had been taught to conſider this people as the moſt blaſphemous infidels. In ten days after I was captured, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſſed up the ſtraits of Gibralter, and I heard the garriſon evening gun fired from that formidable rock; and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hove in ſight of the city of Algiers.</p>

                        <p>The Author is carried into Algiers: Is brought before the Dey: Deſcription of his Perſon, Court and Guards: Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſelecting the Tenth Priſoner.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>WE ſaluted the caſtle with ſeven guns, which was returned with three, and then entered within the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032945_0223_0FF5EB5946DABED8"/>
pier, which forms the port. The priſoners, thirty in number, were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to the caſtle, where we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with great parade by the Dey's troops or cologlies, and guarded to a heavy ſtrong tower of the caſtle. The Portugueſe priſoners, to which nation the Algerines have the moſt violent an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy, were immediately, with every mark of contempt, ſpurned into a dark dungeon beneath the foundations of the tower, though there were ſeveral mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants of eminence, and one young no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleman, in the number. The Spaniards, whom the Dey's ſubjects equally deteſt, and fear more, were confined with me in a grated room, on the ſecond ſtory. We received, the ſame evening, rations ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar to what, we underſtood, were iſſued to the garriſon. The next day, we were all led to a cleanſing houſe, where we were cleared from vermin, our hair cut ſhort, and our beards cloſe ſhaved; thence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032945_0224_0FF5EB2CA885DEF0"/>
taken to a bath, and, after being well bathed, we were clothed in coarſe linen drawers, a ſtrait waiſtcoat of the ſame without ſleeves, and a kind of tunic or looſe coat over the whole, which, with a pair of leather ſlippers, and a blue cotton cap, equipped us, as we were informed, to appear in the preſence of the Dey, who was to ſelect the tenth priſoner from us in perſon. The next morning, the dragomen or interpreters, were very bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy in impreſſing upon us the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found reſpect for the Dey's perſon and power, and teaching us the obeiſance nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary to be made in our approaches to this auguſt potentate. Soon after, we were paraded; and Captain Hamed preſented each of us with a paper, written in a baſe kind of Arabic, deſcribing, as I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, our perſons, names, country, and conditions in life; ſo far as our captors could collect from our ſeveral examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Upon the back of each paper was
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032945_0225_0FF5EB5BD3616D00"/>
a mark or number. The ſame mark was painted upon a flat oval piece of wood, ſomewhat like a painter's palette, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended by a ſmall braſs chain to our necks, hanging upon our breaſts. The guards then formed a hollow ſquare. We were blind folded until we paſſed the fortifications, and then ſuffered to view the city, and the immenſe rabble, which ſurrounded us, until we came to the palace of the Dey. Here, after much military parade, the gates were thrown open, and we entered a ſpacious court yard, at the upper end of which the Dey was ſeated, upon a eminence, covered with the richeſt carpeting fringed with gold. A circular canopy of Perſian ſilk was raiſed over his head, from which were ſuſpended curtains of the richeſt embroidery, drawn into feſtoons by ſilk cords and taſſels, enriched with pearls. Over the eminence, upon the right and left, were canopies, which almoſt vied in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032945_0226_0FF5EB2E2C33C3F0"/>
riches with the former, under which ſtood the Mufti, his numerous Hadgi's, and his principal officers, civil and military; and on each ſide about ſeven hundred foot guards were drawn up in the form of a half moon.</p>
                     <p>The preſent Dey, Vizier Haſſen Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, is about forty years of age, five feet ten inches in height, inclining to corpulen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, with a countenance rather comely than commanding; an eye which betrays ſagacity, rather than inſpires awe: the latter is ſufficiently inſpired by the fierce appearance of his guards, the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour of his attendants, the grandeur of his court, and the magnificence of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire. He was arrayed in a ſumptuous Turkiſh habit. His feet were ſhod with buſkins, bound upon his legs with dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond buttons in loops of pearl; round his waiſt was a broad ſaſh, glittering with jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, to which was ſuſpened a broad ſcim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itar, the hilt of which dazzled the eye

with brilliants of the firſt water, and the ſheath of which was of the fineſt velvet, ſtudded with gems and the pureſt gold. In his ſcarf was ſtuck a poignard and pair of piſtols of exquiſite workmanſhip. Theſe piſtols and poignard were ſaid to have been a preſent from the late unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Louis the ſixteenth. The former was of pure gold, and the value of the work was ſaid to exceed that of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious mettle two hundred times. Upon the Dey's head was a turban with the point erect, which is peculiar to the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al family. A large diamond creſcent ſhone conſpicuous in the front, on the back of which a ſocket received the quills of two large oſtrich feathers, which wav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in graceful majeſty over his head. The priſoners were directed by turns to approach the foot of the eminence. When within thirty paces, we were made to throw ourſelves upon the earth and creep towards the Dey, licking the duſt as
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032945_0228_0FF5EB304EA6E290"/>
a token of reverence and ſubmiſſion. As each captive approached, he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to riſe, pull of his ſlippers, and ſtand with his face bowed to the ground, and his arms croſſed over his breaſt. The chieux or ſecretary then took the paper he carried and read the ſame. To ſome the Dey put queſtions by his drog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oman, others were diſmiſſed by a ſlight nod of his head. After ſome conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the chief men, an officer came to where the priſoners were pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raded, and called for three by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, which was marked on their breaſts. The Dey's prerogative gives him the right to ſelect the tenth of all priſoners; and, as the ſervice or ranſom of them conſtitutes one part of his revenue, his policy is to chooſe thoſe, whoſe friends or wealth would be moſt likely to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich his coffers. At this time, he ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two wealthy Portugueſe merchants, and a young nobleman of the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:032945_0229_0FF5EB5F60DAFAF0"/>
called Don Juan Combri. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after this ſelection, we were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a ſtrong houſe, or rather priſon, in the city, and there guarded by an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer and ſome of the crew of the Rover, that had taken us. The remainder of us being conſidered as private prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, another ſelection was made by the captain and owners of the Rover; and all ſuch, as could probably pay their ranſom in a ſhort time, were removed into a place of ſafety and ſuffered only a cloſe confinement. The remnant of my companions being only eleven, conſiſted of the Negro ſlave, five Portugueſe, two Spaniſh ſailors, an Italian fiddler, a Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man from the Cape of Good Hope, and his Hottentot ſervant. As we could prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no probability of ranſom we were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for another fate.</p>

                     <p>ON the next market day, we were ſtripped of the dreſs, in which we appeared at court A napkin was wrapped round our loins, and a coarſe cloak thrown over our ſhoulders. We were then expoſed for ſale in the market place, which was a ſpacious ſquare, incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ranges of low ſhops, in different ſections of which were expoſed the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious articles intended for ſale. One ſection was gay with flowers; another expoſed all the fruits of the ſeaſon. Grapes, dates, pomegranates, and orang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:032945_0231_0FF5EB6163172780"/>
lay in tempting baſkets. A third was devoted to ſallads and pot herbs; a fourth to milk and cream. Between every ſection was a ſmall room, where thoſe, who come to market, might occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally refreſh themſelves with a pipe of tobacco, a cud of opium, a glaſs of ſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet, or other cooling liquors. Sherbet is compoſed of lemons, oranges, ſugar, and water. It is what we, in New England, call beverage. In the centre of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket, an oblong ſquare was railed in, where the dealers in beaſts and ſlaves expoſed their commodities for ſale. Here were camels, mules, aſſes, goats, hares, dromedaries, women and men, and all other creatures, whether for appetite or uſe; and I obſerved that the purchaſers turned from one article to the other, with equal indifference. The women ſlaves were concealed in a latticed ſhop, but the men were expoſed in open view in a ſtall, ſituated between thoſe appropriated
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:032945_0232_0FF5EB3461D6DF50"/>
to the aſſes and to the kumrah, a wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed looking, though ſerviceable animal in that country, propagated by a jack upon a cow. I now diſcovered the reaſon of the alteration in our dreſs; for, as the people here, no more than in New En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, love to buy a pig in the poke, our looſe coats were eaſily thrown open, and the purchaſer had an opportunity of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining into the ſtate of our bodies. It was aſtoniſhing to obſerve, how critically they examined my muſcles, to ſee if I was naturally ſtrong; moved my limbs in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious directions, to detect any latent lameneſs or injury in the parts; and ſtruck ſuddenly before my eyes, to judge by my winking, if I was clear ſighted. Though I could not underſtand their language, I doubt not, they ſpoke of my activity, ſtrength, age, &amp;c. in the ſame manner, as we at home talk in the ſwop of a horſe. One old man was very crit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical in his examination of me. He made
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032945_0233_0FF5EB63E9491780"/>
me walk, run, lie down, and lift a weight of about ſixty pounds. He went out, and ſoon returned with another man. They conferred together, and the ſecond was more critical in his examination than the firſt. He obliged me to run a few rods, and then laid his hand ſuddenly to my heart, to ſee, as I conjecture, if my wind was good. By the old man I was pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed. What the price given for me was, I cannot tell. An officer of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket atteſted the contract, and I was oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the maſter of the ſhop, who ſold me upon commiſſions, for the benefit of the concerned in the Rover, to lie down in the ſtreet, take the foot of my new maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and place it upon my neck; making to him, what the lawyers call, attornment. I was then ſeized by two ſlaves, and led to the houſe of my new maſter.</p>

ſubmitting to ſuch groſs diſgrace. I will not juſtify myſelf. Perhaps I ought to have aſſerted the dignity of our nation, in deſpite of baſtinadoes, chains, or even death itſelf. Charles the twelfth of Swe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den has however been ſtigmatized by the hiſtorian, as a madman, for oppoſing the inſulting Turk, when a priſoner, though aſſiſted by nearly two hundred brave men. If any of my dear countrymen cenſure my want of due ſpirit, I have only to wiſh him in my ſituation at Algiers, that he may avail himſelf of a noble opportunity of ſuffering gloriouſly for his country.</p>

                     <p>THE higher his rank in ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the further is man removed from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Grandeur draws a circle round the great, and often excludes from them the finer feelings of the heart. The wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed are all of one family; and ever regard each other as brethren. Among the ſlaves of my new maſter, I was received
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:032945_0236_0FF5EB37EA84FAB0"/>
with pity, and treated with tenderneſs, bordering upon fraternal affection. They could not indeed ſpeak my language, and I was ignorant of theirs; but, by dividing the ſcanty meal, compoſing my couch of ſtraw, and alleviating my more rugged la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, they ſpake that univerſal language of benevolence, which needs no linguiſt to interpret.</p>
                     <p>It is true, I did not meet, among my fellow ſlaves, the rich and the noble, as the dramatiſt and the noveliſt had taught me to expect. To betray a weakneſs I will confeſs that, ſometime after I was captured, I often ſuffered fancy to cheat me of my "weary moments," by por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying thoſe ſcenes, which had often a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed me in my cloſet, and delighted me on the ſtage. Sometimes, I even contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated with pleaſure the company and converſe of my fellow ſlaves. I expected to find them men of rank at leaſt, if not of learning. I fancied my maſter's cook
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032945_0237_0FF5EB67782D83F8"/>
an Engliſh lord; his valet an Italian duke; his groom a knight of Malta; and even his foot boy ſome little lively French marquis. I fancied my future maſter's head gardener, taking me one ſide, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the warmeſt friendſhip, and telling me in confidence that he was a Spaniſh Don with forty noble names; that he had fallen in love with my maſter's fair daughter, whoſe mother was a chriſtian ſlave; that the young lady was equally charmed with him; that ſhe was to rob her father of a rich caſket of jewels, there being no diſhonour in ſtealing from an infidel; jump into his arms in boy's clothes that very night, and eſcape by a veſſel, already provided, to his native country. I ſaw in imagination all this accompliſhed. I ſaw the lady deſcend the rope ladder; heard the old man and his ſervants purſue; ſaw the lady carried off breathleſs in the arms of her knight; arrive ſafe in Spain; was preſent at the
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032945_0238_0FF5EB3B0C16F880"/>
lady's baptiſm into the catholic church, and at her marriage with her noble deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erer. I was myſelf almoſt ſtifled with the careſſes of the noble family, for the part I had borne in this perilous adventure; and in fine married to Donna ſome body, the Don's beautiful ſiſter; returned into my own country, loaded with beauty and riches; and perhaps was arouſed from my reverie by a poor fellow ſlave, whoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ignorance had almoſt blunted the ſenſibility of his own wretchedneſs.</p>
                     <p>Indeed, ſo ſweet were the deluſions of my own fancy, I am loth to deſtroy the innocent gratification, which the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of novels and plays enjoy from the works of a Behn and a Colman; but the ſober character of the hiſtorian compels me to aſſure my readers that, whatever may have happened in the ſixteenth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, I never ſaw during my captivity, a man of any rank, family, or fortune a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the menial ſlaves. The Dey, as I
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:032945_0239_0FF5EB699F7BDC38"/>
have already obſerved, ſelecting his tenth priſoner from thoſe, who would moſt probably afford the richeſt ranſom, thoſe concerned in the captures are influenced by the ſame motive. All, who may be expected to be ranſomed, are deprived of this liberty, it is true; but fed, clothed, and never put to manual labour, except as a puniſhment for ſome actual crime, or attempting to recover their lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty. The menial ſlaves are generally compoſed of the dregs of thoſe nations, with whom they are at war; but, though my fellow ſlaves were groſsly illiterate, I muſt do them the juſtice to ſay, they had learned well the kinder virtues: thoſe vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, which ſchools and colleges often fail to teach, which, as Ariſtotle well obſerves, are like a flame of fire. Light them up in whatever climate you will, they burn and ſhine ever the ſame.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE name of my maſter was Abdel Melic. He had been former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an officer in the Dey's troops, and, it was ſaid, had rendered the Dey's father ſome important ſervice in an inſurrection, and was therefore highly reſpected; though at that time he had no publick employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He was an auſtere man; his nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural ſeverity being probably encreaſed by his employment as a military officer. I
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:032945_0241_0FF5EB6C306E7FA0"/>
never ſaw the face of any other perſon in his family, except the male ſlaves. The houſes of the Algerines are nearly all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame model; conſiſting of a building towards the ſtreet of one or two ſtories, which is occupied by the maſter and male domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, and which is connected by a gallery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ground, if the houſe is of one ſtory; if of two, the entrance is above ſtairs, to a building of nearly the ſame ſize behind, which has no windows or lattices at the ſide, but only looking into a garden, which is always ſurrounded by a high wall. In theſe back apartments <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> women are lodged, both wives and ſlaves. My maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter had a wife, the daughter of a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal officer in the Dey's court, and, to my ſurpriſe, had only one. I found it to be a vulgar errour, that the Algerines had gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally more. It is true they are allowed four by their law; but they generally find, as in our country, one lady ſufficient for all the comforts of connubial life; and
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032945_0242_0FF5EB3E95CE88E8"/>
never take another, except family alliance or barrenneſs renders it eligible or nec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſary. The more I became acquainted with their cuſtoms, the more was I ſtruck with their great reſemblance to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchical manners, deſcribed in holy writ. Concubinage is allowed; but few reſpectable people practiſe it, except for the ſake of heirs. With the Algerines the barrenneſs of a RACHEL is ſometimes compenſated to the huſband, by the fertil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of a BILHAH. After I had lived in this town houſe about three weeks, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time I was clothed after the faſhion of the country, my maſter moved, with his whole family, to a country houſe on the river Saffran. Our journey, which was about twelve miles, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed in the evening. Two carriages, reſembling our travelling waggons, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the women. Only the bodies of them were latticed, and furniſhed with cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to cover them in the day time, which
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032945_0243_0FF5EB6E349165C0"/>
were rolled up in the evening. Two ſlaves preceded the carriages. Abdel Melic followed on horſeback, and I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied a baggage waggon in the rear. When we arrived at the country houſe, the garden gates were thrown open, and the carriages with the women entered. The men were introduced to the front apartments. I found here ſeveral more ſlaves, equally ignorant and equally attentive and kind towards me, as thoſe I had ſeen in the town. The next day, we were all ſet to work in digging for the foundation of a new wall, which was to enlarge our maſter's gardens. The weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was ſultry. The ſoil below the ſurface was almoſt a quickſand. I, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed to hard labour, found my ſtrength ſoon exhauſted. My fellow ſlaves, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionating my diſtreſs, were anxious, by changing places with me, to render my ſhare of the labour leſs toilſome. As we had our ſtint for the whole party ſtaked
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032945_0244_0FF5EB40A3480350"/>
out to us every morning, it was in the power of my kind fellow labourers to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour me much. Often would they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt me, by ſigns, to repoſe myſelf in the ſhade, while they encouraged each other to perform my ſhare of the taſk. After a while, our maſter came to inſpect the work; and, conceiving that it did not progreſs as faſt as he wiſhed, he put an overſeer over us, who, finding me not ſo active as the reſt, firſt threatened and then ſtruck me with his whip. This was the firſt diſgraceful blow I had ever received. Judge you, my gallant, freeborn fellow citizens, you, who rejoice daily in our federal ſtrength and independence, what were my ſenſations. I threw down my ſpade with diſdain, and retired from my work, lowering indignation upon my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting oppreſſor. Upon his lifting his whip to ſtrike me again, I flew at him, collared him, and threw him on his back. Then, ſetting my foot on his breaſt, I
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032945_0245_0FF5EB6FB923C6F0"/>
called upon my fellow ſlaves to aſſiſt me to bind the wretch, and to make one glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious effort for our freedom. But I called in vain. They could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend my language; and, if they could, I ſpoke to ſlaves, aſtoniſhed at my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and dreading the conſequences for me and themſelves. After their firſt aſtoniſhment, they ran and took me gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly off from the overſeer, and raiſed him with the greateſt reſpect. No ſooner was he upon his feet than, mad with rage, he took up a mattoc; and, with a violent blow upon my head, levelled me to the ground. I lay ſenſeleſs, and was awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened from my ſtupor by the ſevere laſhes of his whip, with which the daſtardly wretch continued to beat me, until his ſtrength failed. I was then left to the care of my fellow ſlaves, who could only waſh my wounds with their tears. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was immediately made to my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and I was ſent to work in a ſtone
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:032945_0246_0FF5EB4333D8EF18"/>
quarry about two miles from the houſe. At firſt, I rejoiced in eſcaping the malice of this mercileſs overſeer, but ſoon found I had made no advantageous exchange. I was ſurrounded by the moſt miſerable objects. My fellow labourers had been put to this place, as a puniſhment for do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic crimes, or for their ſuperiour ſtrength, and all were obliged to labour equally hard. To break hard rocks with heavy mauls, to tranſport large ſtones upon our backs up the craggy ſides of the quarry, were our common labours; and to drink water, which would have been delicious, if cold, and to eat black barley bread and onions, our daily fare; while the few hours, allotted to reſt upon our flinty beds, were diſturbed by the tormenting inſects, or on my part by the more tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting dreams of the dainties of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's houſe. There is a ſpring under a rock upon my father's farm, which we called the cold ſpring, from which we uſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:032945_0247_0FF5EB71C08BFFD8"/>
to ſupply our family with water, and prided ourſelves in preſenting it as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing beverage, in ſummer, to our viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. How often, after working beyond my ſtrength, on a ſultry African day, in that horrid quarry, have I dreamed of dipping my cup in that cold ſpring, and fancied the waters eluding my taſte as I raiſed it to my lips. Being preſented with a tumbler filled from this ſpring, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my return, in a large, circle of friends, the agonies I had ſuffered came ſo forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly into my recollection, that I could not drink the water, but had the weakneſs to melt into tears.</p>
                     <p>How naturally did the emaciated prod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igal, in the ſcripture, think upon the bread in his father's houſe. Bountiful Father of the Univerſe, how are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon bleſſings of thy providence deſpiſed. When I ate of the bread of my father's houſe, and drank of his refreſhing ſpring, no grateful return was made to him or

thee. It was amidſt the parched ſands and flinty rocks of Africa that thou taughteſt me, that the bread was indeed pleaſant, and the water ſweet. Let thoſe of our fellow citizens, who ſet at nought the rich bleſſings of our federal union, go like me to a land of ſlavery, and they will then learn how to appreciate the value of our free government.</p>

                     <p>AS I was drooping under my daily taſk, I ſaw a young man habited in the Turkiſh dreſs, whoſe clear ſkin and florid cheek convinced me he was not a native of the country; whoſe mild air and manners betrayed nothing of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocity of the renegado. The ſtile of his turban pronounced him a Mahometan; but the look of pity, he caſt towards the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032945_0250_0FF5EB46C09765D0"/>
chriſtian ſlaves, was entirely inconſiſtent with the pious hauteur of the muſſulman; for chriſtian dog is expreſſed as ſtrongly by the features as the tongue of him, they call a true believer. He arreſted my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For a moment I ſuſpended my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. At the ſame moment, an unmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful laſh, from the whip of the ſlave driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, recalled my attention to my work, and excited his, who was the cauſe of my neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect. At his approach, the ſlave driver quitted me. The ſtranger accoſted me, and in good Engliſh commiſſerated my diſtreſſes, which, he ſaid, he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore the more, if they were remedileſs. When a man is degraded to the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſlavery, loſt to his friends, neglected by his country, and can anticipate no reſt but in the grave, is not his ſituation rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edileſs, I replied? Renounce the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, and embrace the Mahometan faith; you are no longer a ſlave, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of life await you, retorted he. You
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032945_0251_0FF5EB766DD064C0"/>
ſee me. I am an Engliſhman. For three years after my captivity, like you, I groaned under the laſh of the ſlave driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; I ate the ſcanty morſel of bitterneſs, moiſtened with my tears. Borne down by the complicated ills of hunger and ſevere labour, I was carried to the infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary for ſlaves, to breathe my laſt, where I was viſited by a Mollah or Mahometan prieſt. He pitied the misfortunes of a wretch, who, he ſaid, had ſuffered a cruel exiſtence, in this life, and had no rational hopes of exchanging it for a better, in the world to come. He opened the great truths of the muſſulman faith. By his aſſiſtance I recovered my health, and was received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the faithful. Embraced and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the rich and powerful, I have now a houſe in the city, a country reſidence on the Saffran, two beautiful wives, a train of domeſtics; and a reſpectable place in the Dey's cuſtoms defrays the expenſe. Come, added he, let me ſend
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:032945_0252_0FF5EB48CEE18260"/>
my friend, the Mollah, to you. He will remove your ſcruples, and, in a few days, you will be as free and happy as I am. I looked at him with aſtoniſhment. I had ever viewed the character of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate as odious and deteſtable. I turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from him with abhorrence, and for once embraced my burthen with pleaſure. Indeed I pity you, ſaid he. I ſorrow for your diſtreſſes, and pity your preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices. I pity you too, replied I, the tears ſtanding in my eyes. My body is in ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but my mind is free. Your body is at liberty, but your ſoul is in the moſt abject ſlavery, in the gall of bitterneſs and bond of iniquity. You have ſold your God for filthy lucre; and "what ſhall it profit you, if you gain the whole world and loſe your own ſoul, or what ſhall a man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his ſoul." I reſpect your prej<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>udices, ſaid the ſtranger, becauſe I have been ſubject to them myſelf. I was born in Birmingham in England, and educated a
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:032945_0253_0FF5EB77F1B78A00"/>
rigid diſſenter. No man is more ſubject to prejudice than an Engliſhman, and no ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary more obſtinately attached to his tenets than the diſſenter. But I have converſed with the Mollah, and I am convinced of the errours of my education. Converſe with him likewiſe. If he does not convince you, you may glory in the chriſtian faith; as that faith will be then founded on ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional preference, and not merely on your ignorance of any other religious ſyſtem. Suggeſt the leaſt deſire to converſe with the Mollah, and an order from the Mufti will come to your maſter. You will be clothed and fed at the public expenſe; be lodged one month in the college of the prieſt; and not returned to your labours, until the prieſt ſhall declare you incorrigible. He then left me. The heat increaſed, and my ſtrength waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The proſpect of ſome alleviation from labour, and perhaps a curioſity to hear what could be ſaid in favour of ſo
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:032945_0254_0FF5C40FA2DD9538"/>
deteſtably ridiculous a ſyſtem, as the Mahometan impoſture, induced me, when I ſaw the Engliſhman again, to ſignify my conſent to converſe with the Mollah.</p>

                        <p>The Author is carried to the ſacred College of the Muſſulman Prieſt: The Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations and Auſterities of the Mahometan Recluſe. The Muſſulman mode of Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elyting.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE next day, an order came from the Mufti to my maſter, who receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the order, touched his forehead with the tefta reſpectfully, and directed me to be inſtantly delivered to the Mollah. I was carried to the college, a large gloomy building, on the outſide; but, within the walls, it was an earthly paradiſe. The
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:032945_0256_0FF5EB4D8AC337F0"/>
ſtately rooms, refreſhing baths, cooling fountains, luxuriant gardens, ample lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, rich carpets, downy ſofas, and ſilken mattreſſes, offered with profuſion all thoſe ſoft excitements to indolent pleaſure, which the moſt refined voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary could deſire. I have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that, in all countries, except New England, thoſe, whoſe profeſſion it is to decry the luxuries and vanities of this world, ſome how or other, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to poſſeſs the greateſt portion of them.</p>
                     <p>Immediately upon my entering theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred walls, I was carried to a warm bath, into which I was immediately plunged; while my attendants, as if emulous to cleanſe me from all the filth of errour, rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed me ſo hard with their hands and fleſh bruſhes, that I verily thought they would have flayed me. While I was relaxed with the tepid, I was ſuddenly plunged into a contiguous cold bath. I confeſs I
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:032945_0257_0FF5EB7C941B9D10"/>
apprehended dangerous conſequences, from ſo ſudden a check of ſuch violent perſpiration; but I aroſe from the cold bath highly invigorated. <note n="*" place="bottom">The Indian of North America ſurpriſed the European phyſician, by a proceſs founded on ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilar principles. The patient, in the moſt violent fever, was confined in a low hut, built of turf and flat ſtones, which had been previouſly heated by fire. When the profuſeſt perſpiration was thus excited, the patient was carried, and often, with Indian fortitude, ran to the next ſtream, and plunged frequently through the ice into the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt water. This proceſs, which Boerhaave and Sydenham would have pronounced deletery, ever produced priſtine health and vigour, when preſcribed by the Indian phyſician or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wow.</note> I was then an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ointed in all parts, which had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the ſun with a preparation of a gum, called the balm of Mecca. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication excited a very uneaſy ſenſation, ſimilar to the ſtroke of the water pepper,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:032945_0258_0FF5EB4F0E88DEF8"/>
to which "the liberal ſhepherds give a groſſer name." In twenty four hours, the ſun browned cuticle peeled off, and left my face, hands, legs, and neck as fair as a child's of ſix months old. This balm the Algerine ladies procure at a great expenſe, and uſe it as a coſmetic to heighten their beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
                     <p>After I had been clothed in the drawers, ſlippers, looſe coat, and ſhirt of the country, if ſhirt it could be called, which neck had none; with a decoction of the herb hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, my hands and feet were tinged yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: which colour, they ſaid, denoted purity of intention. I was lodged and fed well, and ſuffered to amuſe myſelf, and recover my ſanity of body and mind.

He was born at Antioch, and educated a chriſtian of the Greek church. He was deſigned by his parents for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferment in that church, when he was cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured by the Algerines, and almoſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, conformed to the muſſulman faith; and was in high eſteem in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred college of the prieſts. As he ſpoke latin and ſome modern languages fluent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was well verſed in the bible and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian doctrines, he was often employed in proſelyting the European ſlaves, and prided himſelf in his frequent ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
                     <p>He accoſted me with the ſweeteſt mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation of voice; kindly inquired after my welfare; begged to know if my lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, dreſs, and fare, were agreeable; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring me that, if I wiſhed to alter either, in ſuch a manner as to bring them nearer to the fare and modes of my native country, and would give my directions, they ſhould be obeyed. He requeſted me to appoint
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:032945_0260_0FF5EBB12BDBEF90"/>
a time, when we might converſe upon the great ſubject of religion. He obſerved that he wiſhed me free from bodily indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and that the powers of my mind would recover their activity. He ſaid, the holy faith, he offered to my embraces, diſdained the uſe of other powers than ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional argument; that he left to the church of Rome, and its mercileſs inquiſitors, all the honour and profit of converſion by faggots, dungeons, and racks. He made ſome further inquiry, as to my uſage in the college, and retired. I had been ſo long accuſtomed to the inſolence of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic tyranny; ſo often groaned under the whip and burthen; ſo often been buffetted, ſpurned and ſpit upon, that I had ſteeled my mind againſt the ſorce and terrour, I anticipated from the Mollah; but was totally unprepared for ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent candour and gentleneſs. Though I viewed his conduct as inſidious, yet he no ſooner retired than, overcome by his

If you argue from the aſtoniſhing ſpread of your faith, view our prophet, born five hundred and ſixty nine years, and dating the promulgation of his doctrine ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty years after the birth of your prophet.

                        <p>So is ours; which is the more remarkable, as our great prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, he was not ſent into the world to work miracles, but to preach the unity of the firſt cauſe, the reſurrection of the dead, the bliſs of paradiſe, and the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the damned. Yet his whole life was a miracle. He was no ſooner born than, with a voice, like the thundering of Heronon, he pronounced the adorable creed to his mother and nurſes: <hi>I profeſs
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032945_0268_0FF5EBB96E7F55E8"/>
that there is only one God, and that I am his apoſtle.</hi> He was circumciſed from all eternity; and, at the ſame hour, a voice of four mighty angels was heard proclaiming from the four corners of the holy houſe. The firſt ſaying, proclaim the truth is riſen, and all lies ſhall return into hell. The ſecond uttering, now is born an apoſtle of your own nation, and the Omnipotent is with him. The words of the third were, a book full of illuſtrious light is ſent to you from God; and the fourth voice was heard to ſay, O Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met, we have ſent thee to be a prophet, apoſtle, and guide to the world.</p>
                        <p>When the ſent of God was about three years old, the bleſſed child retired into a cave, at the baſis of mount Uriel; when the archangel Gabriel, covering his face with his wings, in awful reſpect approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſaying, Biſmillahi Rrahmani Rrha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>himi; in the name of the one Almighty, Compaſſionate, and Merciful, I am ſent to
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:032945_0269_0FF5EB8860A116A0"/>
pluck from thy heart the root of evil; for thy prayers have ſhaken the pillars of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal decree. The infant prophet ſaid, the will of thy Lord and mine be done. The archangel, then opened his boſom with a lancet of adamant, and, taking out his heart, ſqueezed from it the black drop of original ſin; and, having reſtored the heart, ſunk gently into the boſom of the Houri.</p>
                        <p>Do you wiſh for more miracles? Hear how the prophet, in the dark night, paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the ſeven heavens upon the ſacred mule; of the mighty angel he ſaw, of ſuch aſtoniſhing magnitude, that it was twelve thouſand days journey in the ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his eye brows; of the years he pent in peruſing the book of deſtiny; and how he returned, ſo ſpeedily that, the mattreſs was not cold, and he recovered the pitcher at his bed ſide, which he had overſet at his departure, ſo that not one drop of water was loſt. Contraſt theſe
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:032945_0270_0FF5EBBB75D78DD8"/>
with thoſe of your prophet. He then vented a volume of reproach horrible to hear, and too blaſphemous to defile my paper.</p>

                        <p>My friend, you ſurely have not read the writings of your own hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians. The hiſtory of the chriſtian church is a detail of bloody maſſacre: from the inſtitution of the chriſtian thundering le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, under Conſtantine the great, to the expulſion of the Moors out of Spain by the ferocious inquiſition, or the dragoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Hugonots from France, under Louis the great. The muſſulmen never yet forced a man to adopt their faith. When Abubeker, the caliph, took a chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian city, he forbore to enter a principal church, as he ſhould pray in the temple of God; and, where he prayed, the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would be eſtabliſhed as a moſque by
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:032945_0271_0FF5EB8A7B018B88"/>
the piety of the faithful. The compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions and ſucceſſours of the apoſtle conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cities and kingdoms, like other nations. They gave civil laws to the conquered, according to the laws of nations; but they never forced the conſcience of any man. It is true, they then and we now, when a ſlave pronounces the infallible creed, immediately knock off his fet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and receive him as a brother; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we read in the book of Zuni that the ſouls of true believers are bound up in one fragrant bundle of eternal love. We leave it to the chriſtians of the Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and chriſtians of your ſouthern plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, to baptize the unfortunate Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican into your faith, and then uſe your brother chriſtians as brutes of the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert.</p>

                        <p>So the doctors of your church tell you; but a ſenſual heaven is no more imputable to us than to you. When the Moſt Holy condeſcends to reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to man in human language, it muſt be in terms commenſurate with our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. The enjoyment of the Houri, thoſe immortal virgins, who will attend the beatified believer; the ſplendid pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilions of the heavens, are all but types and ſignifications of holy joys too ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime for man in fleſh to conceive of. In your bible, I read, your prophet refers to the time, when he ſhould drink new wine in his father's kingdom. Now would it be candid in me to haſtily brand the heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of your prophet as ſenſual, and to rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſent your faithful in bliſs as a club of wine bibbers?</p>

excellent rules of life. You are there taught to be kindly affectionate one to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards another; but they recommend the uſe of wine, and do not forbid gaming. The alcoran, by forbidding in expreſs terms the uſe of either, cuts from its fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower the two principal ſources of diſqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and miſery. Read then this ſpotleſs book. There you will learn to love thoſe of our faith, and not hate thoſe of any other. You will learn the neceſſity of being vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous here, that you may be happy and not miſerable hereafter. You will learn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to the will of the Holy One; becauſe you will know, that all the events of your life were, in the embryo of time, forged on the anvils of Divine Wiſdom.

as a great apoſtle of God; but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet is the ſeal of the prophet. Turn then, my friend, from ſlavery to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of life.

                        <p>I have thus given a few ſketches of the manner of this artful prieſt.

                     <p>THE very day, I was diſmiſſed from the college of the prieſts, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to my maſter, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſent again to labour in the quarry. To my ſurpriſe, no harſh reflections were made upon, what theſe true believers muſt have ſtiled, my obſtinate prejudice againſt the true faith; for I am ſenſible that my maſter was ſo good a muſſulman as to have rejoiced in my converſion, though it might affect his purſe. I experienced
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:032945_0276_0FF5EBC194888BC8"/>
the extremeſt contumely and ſeverity; but I was never branded as a heretic. I had by this time acquired ſome knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of their language, if language it could be called, which bad defiance to modes and tenſes, appearing to be the ſhreds and clippings of all the tongues, dead and living, ever ſpoken ſince the creation. It is well known on the ſea coaſts of the Mediterranean by the name of LINGUA FRANCA. Probably it had its riſe in the awkward endeavours of the natives to converſe with ſtrangers from all parts of the world, and the vulgar people, calling all foreigners <hi>Franks,</hi> ſupplied its <hi>name.</hi> I the more readily acquired this jargon, as it contained many Latin derivatives. If I have conjectured the principle, upon which the <hi>Lingua Franca</hi> was originally formed, it is applied through all ſtages of its exiſtence: every perſon having good right to introduce words and phraſes from his vernacular tongue, and which, with
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:032945_0277_0FF5EB909382C040"/>
ſome alteration in accent, are readily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted.<note n="*" place="bottom">I well recollect, being once at a loſs to name a compoſition of boiled barley, rice and treacle, I called for the HASTY PUDDING and MOLASSES. The phraſe was immediately adopted, and HASCHI PUDAH MOLASCHI is now a ſynonima with the ancient name: and, I doubt not, if a dictionary of the Lingua Franca ſhall ever be compiled, the name of the ſtaple cookery of New England will have a conſpicuous place.</note>

                     <p>I FOUND many more ſlaves at work in the ſtone quarry, than when I
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032945_0279_0FF5EB929C80CC78"/>
quitted it; and the labours and hard fare ſeemed, if poſſible, to be augmented. The eaſe and comfort, with which I lived for ſome weeks paſt, had vitiated my appetite, ſoftened my hands, and relaxed my whole frame, ſo that my coarſe fare and rugged labours ſeemed more inſupportable. I nauſeated our homely food, and the ſkin peeled from my hands and ſhoulders. I made what inquiries I could, as to the interiour geography of the country, and comforted myſelf with theh ope of eſcape; conceiving it, under my deſperate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, poſſible to penetrate unobſerved the interiour country, by the eaſtern boundaries of the kingdom of Morocco, and then paſs on ſouth weſt, until I ſtruck the river Sanaga, and courſing that to its mouth I knew would bring me to ſome of the European ſettlements near Goree or Cape Verd. Preparatory to my intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eſcape I had procured an old goat's ſkin, which to make into ſomething like a
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032945_0280_0FF5EBC65E53EE68"/>
knapſack, I deprived myſelf of many hours of neceſſary ſleep; and of many a ſcanty meal to fill it with proviſions. By the uſe of my Lingua Franca and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Arabic, I hoped to obtain the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the ſlaves and lower orders of the people, through whom I might journey. The only inſurmountable difficulty in my projects was to elude the vigilance of our overſeers. By a kind of roll call the ſlaves were numbered every night and morning, and at meal times: but, very fortunate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a probable opportunity of eſcaping unnoticed ſoon offered. It was announced to the ſlaves that in three days time there would be a day of reſt, a holiday, when they would be allowed to recreate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the fields. This intelligence diffuſed general joy. I received it with rapture. I doubled my diligence in my preparations; and, in the afternoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to this fortunate day, I contrived to place my little ſtock of proviſions under
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032945_0281_0FF5EB951F25C528"/>
a rock at a ſmall diſtance from the quarry. At ſunſet we were all admitted to bathe, and I retired to my repoſe with bright hopes of freedom in my heart, which were ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by the moſt pleaſing dreams of my native land. That Beneficent Being, who brightens the ſlumbers of the wretched with rays of bliſs, can alone expreſs my raptures, when, in the viſions of that night, I ſtepped lightly over a father's threſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold; was ſurrounded by congratulating friends and faithful domeſtics; was preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the embraces of a father; and with holy joy felt a mother's tears moiſten my cheek.</p>
                     <p>Early in the dawn of the morning, I was awakened by the congratulations of my fellows, who immediately collected in ſmall groups, planning out the intended amuſements of the day.

maſter that we ſhould go under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate direction of our overſeers, to a plain, about five miles diſtance, to be preſent at a publick ſpectacle. This was a grievous diſappointment to them, and more eſpecially to me. I buoyed up my ſpirits however with the hopes that, in the hurry and crowd, I might find means to eſcape, which, although I knew I could not return for my knapſack, I was reſolved to attempt, having a little millet and two onions in my pocket.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WE were ſoon paraded and marched to the plain, to be amuſed with the promiſed ſpectacle, which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it might probably fruſtrate my attempts for freedom, I anticipated with a pleaſing curioſity. When we arrived at the plain, we found, ſurrounding a ſpot, fenced in with a ſlight railing, a large concourſe of people, among whom I could diſcern many groups of men, whoſe hab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its and ſorrow indented faces ſhewed them to be of the ſame miſerable order with us. In the midſt of this ſpot there was a frame
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:032945_0284_0FF5EBC9EA5E40A0"/>
erected, ſomewhat reſembling the ſtage of our pillories; on the centre of which a pole or ſtrong ſtake was erected, ſharpened at the end and pointed with ſteel. While I was perplexing myſelf with the deſign of this apparatus, military muſic was heard at a diſtance; and ſoon after a ſtrong party of guards approached the ſcaffold, and ſoon mounted upon the ſtage a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable wretch, with all the agonies of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair in his countenance, who I learned from his ſentence, proclaimed by a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic crier, was to be impailed alive for at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to eſcape from bondage. The conſciouſneſs that I had been, one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment before, meditating the ſame act, for which this wretch was to ſuffer ſo cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, added to my feelings for a fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, excited ſo ſtrong a ſympathy for the devoted wretch, that I was near faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>I will not wound the ſenſibility of my humane fellow citizens, by a minute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:032945_0285_0FF5EB98AAC952C8"/>
of this fiend like puniſhment. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to ſay that, after they had ſtripped the ſufferer naked, except a cloth around the loins, they inſerted the iron pointed ſtake into the lower termination of the vertebrae, and thence forced it up near his back bone, until it appeared between his ſhoulders; with deviliſh ingenuity contriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to avoid the vital parts. The ſtake was then raiſed into the air, and the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering wretch expoſed to the view of the aſſembly, writhing in all the contortions of inſupportable agony. How long he lived, I cannot tell, I never gave but one look at him: one was enough to appal a New England heart. I laid my head on the rails, until we retired. It was now obvious,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it was deſigned by our maſter, that this horrid ſpectacle ſhould operate upon us as a terrifying example. It had its full effect on me. I thought no more of attempting an eſcape; but, during our return, was miſerably tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented

                     <p>I NOW found that I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a ſlave. My body had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralled, but the dignity of a free mind remained; and the ſame inſulted pride, which had impelled me to ſpurn the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain ſlave driver, who firſt ſtruck me a diſgraceful blow, had often excited a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look of contempt upon my maſter, and the vile inſtruments of his oppreſſion; but the terrour of the late execution, with
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:032945_0288_0FF5EBCEB4BF43F0"/>
the unabating fatigue of my body, had ſo depreſſed my fortitude, that I trembled at the look of the overſeer, and was meanly anxious to conciliate his favour, by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting perſonal exertions beyond my ability. The trite ſtory of the inſurgent army of the ſlaves of ancient Rome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing routed by the mere menaces and whips of their maſters, which I ever ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically received, I now credit. A ſlave myſelf, I have learned to appreciate the bleſſings of freedom. May my country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ever preſerve and tranſmit to their poſterity that liberty, which they have bled to obtain; and always bear it deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engraven upon their memories, that, when men are once reduced to ſlavery, they can never reſolve, much more achieve, any thing, that is manly, virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, or great.</p>
                     <p>Depreſſion of ſpirits, conſequent upon my blaſted hope of eſcape, coarſe fare, and conſtant fatigue reduced me to a mere
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:032945_0289_0FF5EB9D5D03C3D0"/>
ſkeleton: while over exertion brought on an haemoptyſis or expectoration of blood, and menaced an approaching hectic; and ſoon after, fainting under my bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, I was taken up and conveyed in a horſe litter to the infirmary for ſlaves, in the city of Algiers.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>HERE I was lodged comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and had all the attention paid me, which good nurſes and ignorant phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians could render. The former were men, who had made a vow of poverty, and whoſe profeſſion was to attend the couches of the ſick; the latter were more ignorant than thoſe of my own country, who had amuſed me in the gayer days of life. They had no theory nor any ſyſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atic practice; but it was immaterial to me. I had caſt my laſt anxious thoughts upon
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:032945_0291_0FF5EB9F6A1FB4E8"/>
my dear native land, had bleſſed my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate parents, and was reſigned to die.</p>
                     <p>One day as I was ſunk upon my bed, after a violent fit of coughing, I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened from a doze, by a familiar voice, which accoſted me in Latin. I opened my eyes and ſaw at my ſide, the Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lah, who attempted to deſtroy my faith. It immediately ſtruck me that his purpoſe was to tempt me to apoſtatize in my laſt moments. The religion of my country was all I had left of the many bleſſings, I once enjoyed, in common with my fellow citizens. This rendered it doubly dear to me. Not that I was inſenſible of the excellence and verity of my faith; no. If I had been expoſed to ſeverer agonies than I ſuffered, and had been flattered with all the riches and honours, theſe infidels could beſtow, I truſt I ſhould never have foregone that faith, which aſſured me for the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, I ſuſtained in a cruel ſeparation from
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:032945_0292_0FF5EBD2675FD198"/>
my parents, friends, and intolerable ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, a rich compenſation in that future world, where I ſhould rejoin my beloved friends, and where ſorrow, miſery, or ſlavery, ſhould never come. I judged uncandidly of the prieſt. He accoſted me with the ſame gentleneſs, as when at the college, commiſerated my deplorable ſituation, and, upon my expreſſing an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to talk upon religion, he aſſured me that he diſdained taking any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of my weakneſs; nor would attempt to deprive me of the conſolation of my faith, when he feared I had no time left to ground me in a better. He recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended me to the particular care of the religious, who attended the ſick in the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital; and, having learned in our former conferences that I was educated a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, he influenced his friend the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the infirmary to purchaſe me, if I regained my health, and told him I would be ſerviceable, as a minor aſſiſtant. If
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:032945_0293_0FF5EBA0EF8D9968"/>
any man could have effected a change of my religion, it was this prieſt. I was charmed with the man, though I abom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inated his faith. His very ſmile exhiler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated my ſpirits and infuſed health; and, when he repeated his viſits, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated his plan of alleviating my diſtreſſes, the very idea, of being freed from the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of Abdel Melic, made an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of ſlavery appear deſirable. I was again attached to life, and requeſted him to procure a ſmall quantity of the quinquina or jeſuits bark. This excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpecific was unknown in the infirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; but, as the Algerines are all fataliſts, it is immaterial to the patient, who is his phyſician, and what he preſcribes. By his kindneſs the bark was procured, and I made a decoction, as near to Huxham's, as the ingredients I could procure would admit, which I infuſed in wine; no bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy being allowed, even for the ſick. In a few weeks, the diagnoſtics, were favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:032945_0294_0FF5EBD4750549B8"/>
and I recovered my priſtine health; and, ſoon after, the director of the hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital purchaſed me of my late maſter, and I was appointed to the care of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine room, with permiſſion to go into the city for freſh ſupplies.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>MY circumſtances were now ſo greatly ameliorated that, if I could have been aſſured of returning to my native country in a few years, I ſhould have eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed them eligible. To obſerve the cuſtoms, habits, and manners of a people, of whom ſo much is ſaid and ſo little known at home; and eſpecially to notice the medical practice of a nation, whoſe anceſtors have been ſpoken of with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in the annals of the healing art, was highly intereſting.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="unknown:032945_0296_0FF5EBD712CF6A18"/>
After a marked and aſſiduous atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome months to the duties of my office, I acquired the confidence of my ſuperiours ſo far, that I was ſometimes ſent abroad in the city to examine a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, who had applied for admiſſion into the infirmary; and ſometimes the phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians themſelves would condeſcend to conſult me. Though they affected to deſpiſe my ſkill, I had often the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of obſerving that they adminiſtered my preſcriptions with ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>In ſurgery they were arrant bunglers. Indeed, their pretenſions to knowledge in this branch were ſo ſmall that my ſuperiour adroitneſs ſcarce occaſioned envy. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, vulgarly common in the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, were there viewed with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The actual cautery was their only method of ſtaunching an external hemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage. The firſt amputation, I operated, drew all the principal phyſicians around me. Nothing could equal their ſurprize,
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:032945_0297_0FF5EBA582D9C068"/>
at the application of the ſpring tourni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, which I had aſſiſted a workman to make for the occaſion, except the taking up of the arteries. My friend the Mollah came to congratulate me on my ſucceſs, and ſpread my reputation wherever he viſited. A poor creature was brought to the hoſpital with a depreſſed fracture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the os frontis, ſunk into a lethargy, and died. I propoſed trepanning, but found thoſe uſeful inſtruments unknown in this country. By the care of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector, I had a ſet made under my direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but, after having performed upon a dead, I never could perſuade the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine faculty to permit me to opperate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a living ſubject. What was more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſing, they pretended to improve the aid of philoſophy againſt me, and talked of the weight of a column of air preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the dura mater, which, they ſaid, would cauſe inſtant death. Of all follies the foppery of learning is the moſt
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032945_0298_0FF61D1EE8DA2910"/>
inſupportable. Profeſſional ignorance and obſtinacy were not all I had to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with. Religious prejudice was a conſtant impediment to my ſucceſs. The bigotry of the Mahometan differs eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially from that of the Roman catholic. The former is a paſſive, the latter an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive principle. The papiſt will burn infidels and heretics; the Muſſulman never torments the unbeliever, but is more tenaciouſly attached to his own creed, makes his faith a principle in life, and never ſuffers doubt to diſturb, or reaſon to overthrow it. I verily believe that, if the alcoran had declared, that the earth was an immenſe plain and ſtood ſtill, while the ſun performed its revolution round it, a whole hoſt of Gallileos, with a Newton at their head, could not have ſhaken their opinion, though aided by all the demonſtrative powers of experiment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al philoſophy.</p>
                     <p>I was invited by one of the faculty to
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:032945_0299_0FF5EBA78953B9D0"/>
inſpect the eyes of a child, which had loſt its ſight about three years; I propoſed couching, and operated on the right eye with ſucceſs. This child was the only ſon of an opulent Algerine, who, being inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that an infidel had reſtored his ſon to ſight, refuſed to let me operate on the other, proteſting that, if he had known that the operator was an unbeliever, his ſon ſhould have remained blind, until he opened his eyes upon the Houri of para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe. He ſent me however a preſent of money, and offered to make my fortune, if I would abjure the chriſtian faith and embrace Ismaeliſm, which, he ſaid, he believed, I ſhould one day do: as he thought that God never would have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that I ſhould reſtore his ſon to ſight, if he had not alſo decreed that I ſhould be a true believer.</p>

                        <p>Viſits a ſick Lady.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>MY reputation increaſed, and I was called the learned ſlave; and, ſoon after, ſent for to viſit a ſick lady. This was very agreeable to me; for, during my whole captivity, I had never yet ſeen the face of a woman; even the female chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren being carefully concealed, at leaſt
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:032945_0301_0FF5EBA90E3B4B98"/>
from the ſight of the vulgar. I now an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated much ſatiſfaction from this viſit, and hoped that, through the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, with which a tender and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful phyſician ſeldom fails to inſpire his patient, I ſhould be able to acquire much uſeful information upon ſubjects of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic concern, impervious to travellers. Preparatory to this viſit, I had received a new and better ſuit of clothes than I had worn, as a preſent from the father of the young lady. A gilt waggon came to the gate of the hoſpital, which I entered with our principal phyſician, and was drawn by mules to a country houſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five miles from the city, where I was received by Hadgi Mulladin, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my patient, with great civility. Real gentlemen are the ſame in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. He treated us with fruit and ſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet; and, ſmiling upon me, after he had preſented a bowl of ſherbet to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal phyſician, he handed me another
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:032945_0302_0FF5EBDAAF949678"/>
bowl, which to my ſurpriſe I found fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with an excellent Greek wine, and archly inquired of me how I liked the <hi>ſherbet.</hi> Hadgi Mulladin had travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in his youth, and was ſuppoſed to have imbibed the libertine principles of the chriſtian, as it reſpected wine. This was the only inſtance, which came to my knowledge, of any profeſſed Muſſulman indulging himſelf with wine or any ſtrong liquor; and it was not unnoticed by the principal phyſician, who afterwards grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told me that Hadgi Mulladin would be undoubtedly damned for drinking wine; would be condemned to perpetual thirſt in the next world, while the black ſpirit would preſent him with red hot cups of ſcalding wine. Exhilirated by the wine and the comparitively free manners of this Algerine, I was anxious to ſee my patient. I was ſoon gratified. Being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced into a large room, I was left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone nigh an hour. A ſide door was
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:032945_0303_0FF5EBAB1DB97B58"/>
then opened, and two eunuchs came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with much ſolemnity and made ſigns for me to retire to the fartheſt part of the room, as if I had been infeſted with ſome malignant diſorder. They were, in about ten minutes, followed by four more of the ſame ſex, bearing a ſpecies of couch, cloſe covered with double curtains of ſilk, which they ſet down in the midſt of the room; and every one drew a broad ſcimitar from his belt, flouriſhing it in the air, inclined it over his ſhoulder, and ſtood guard at every corner of the couch, While I was wondering at this parade, the two firſt eunuchs retired and ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned; the one bearing an ewer or baſon of water, the other a low marble ſtand, and ſome napkins in a China diſh. I was then directed to waſh my feet; and, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other baſon being produced, it was ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that I muſt waſh my hands, which I did three times. A large thick muſlin veil was then thrown over my head, I was
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032945_0304_0FF5EBDD036EF7A0"/>
led towards the couch, and was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented with a pulſe glaſs, being a long glaſs tube graduated and terminated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low with a hollow bulb, and filled with ſome liquid, which roſe and fell like ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its in the thermometer. This inſtrument was inſerted through the curtains, and the bulb applied to the pulſe of my patient, and the other extremity put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my veil. By this I was to form my opinion of her diſorder, and preſcribe a remedy; for I was not allowed to aſk any queſtions or even to ſpeak to, much more ſee the lady, who was ſoon reconveyed to her apartment. The two firſt eunuchs now marched in the rear, and cloſed and faſtened the doors carefully after them. After waiting alone two hours or more, I was called to give my advice; and never was I more puzzled. To confeſs igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance would have ruined my reputation, and reputation was then life itſelf. The temptations to quackery were powerful
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:032945_0305_0FF5EBAD9F73A2C0"/>
and overcame me. I boldly pronounced her diſeaſe to be an intermittent fever, preſcribed veneſection, and exhibited ſome common febrifuge, with directions to throw in the bark, when the fever ceaſed. My preſcriptions were attended with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable ſucceſs; and, if I had conformed to their faith, beyond a doubt, I might have acquired immenſe riches. But I was a ſlave, and all my gains were the property of my maſter. I muſt do him the juſtice to ſay that, he permitted me to keep any particular preſents, that were made to me. Frequent applications were made to the director for my advice and aſſiſtance to the diſeaſed; and, though he received generally my fee, yet it was ſufficiently gratifiying to me to be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to walk abroad, to amuſe myſelf, and obtain information of this extraordinary people, as much of which, as the preſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed limits of this little work will admit, I ſhall now lay before my readers.</p>

                     <p>MUCH antiquarian lore might here be diſplayed, in determining wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the ſtate of Algiers was part of the ancient Mauritinia Maſſilia, or within the boundaries of the republic of Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage; and pages of fruitleſs reſearch might be waſted, in preciſely aſcertaining the era, when that portion of the ſea coaſt of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:032945_0307_0FF5EBAFA7EE59E0"/>
now generally known by the name of the Barbary <note n="*" place="bottom">Bruce, an Engliſhman, who travelled to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect fairy tales for the amuſement of London cits, obſerves that this territory was called <hi>Barbaria</hi> by the Greeks and Romans from <hi>Beber,</hi> ſignifying a ſhepherd; and even the accurate compiler of the American edition of Guthrie's Geography has quoted the obſervation in a marginal note. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not expect that geographers ſhould be philologiſts any more than that every printer ſhould be a Webſter. How the Greeks or Romans came by the word <hi>Beber,</hi> I leave Mr. Bruce to elucidate. The form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had the term <hi>barbaros,</hi> a barbarian, which they indiſcriminately applied to all foreigners; and, when Greek literature became faſhionable in Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſchools, the latter adopted the term, and <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barus</hi> was applied by the Romans with the ſame ſoppiſh contempt.</note> Shore, was ſubdued by the Romans, or conquered by the Vandals.</p>
                     <p>The hiſtory of nations like the biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy of man, only aſſumes an intereſting importance, when its ſubject is matured into vigour. To trace the infancy of the
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:032945_0308_0FF5EBE1DD2CA4A8"/>
old world, we run into childiſh prattle and boyiſh tales. Suffice it then to ſay, that the mixed multitudes, which inhabited this country, were reduced to the ſubjection of the Greek emperours by the arms of the celebrated Beliſarius, and ſo continued, until the cloſe of the ſeventh century, when they were ſubdued by the invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble power, and converted to the creed of the ancient caliphs, the immediate ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours of the prophet Mahomet, who parcelled the country into many ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate governments, among which was that of Algiers; which is now bounded, on the north, by the Mediterranean; on the ſouth, by mount Atlas, ſo familiar to the claſſic reader, and the chain of hills, which extends thence to the north eaſt; on the weſt, by the kingdom of Morocco; <note n="*" place="bottom">The common geography compilers add the kingdom of T<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

The face of many a country, which that learned writer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes, differs as much from the truth, as his own phyſiognomy from the true line of beauty.</note> and,
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:032945_0309_0FF5EC155C5E0DF0"/>
on the eaſt, by the ſtate of Tunis. The ſtate of Algiers is about five hundred miles in length, upon the coaſt of the Mediterranean, and from fifty to one hundred and twenty miles in breadth, and boaſts about as large an extent of territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as is contained in all the United States proper, which lay to the north of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania including the ſame.</p>
                     <p>It was nine hundred years after the conqueſt of the caliphs, and at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the tenth century, that the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, by becoming formidable to the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans, acquired the notice of the enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened hiſtorian. About this time, two enterprizing young men, ſons of a potter, of the iſland of Mytelene the ancient Leſbos,
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:032945_0310_0FF5EC0CB540EF40"/>
called Horrie and Hayraddin, collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a number of deſperadoes, ſeized upon a brigantine and commenced pirates, making indiſcriminate depredations upon the veſſels of all nations. They ſoon augmented their force to a fleet of twelve gallies, beſide ſmall craft, with which they infeſted the ſea coaſt of Spain and Italy, and carried their booty into the ports of Barbary, ſtyling themſelves the lords of the ſea, and the enemies of all thoſe, who ſailed upon it. European nations were not then poſſeſſed of ſuch eſtabliſhed and formidable navies, as at the preſent day: even the Engliſh, who ſeem formed for the command of the ſea, had but few ſhips of force. Henry the eighth built ſome veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which, from their unmanageable bulk, were rather ſuited for home defence than foreign enterprize; and the fleet of Elizabeth, which, in fifteen hundred and eighty eight, deſtroyed the Spaniſh. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mada, was principally formed of ſhips,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:032945_0311_0FF5EC17A85729E8"/>
chartered by the merchants, who were the general reſource of all the maratime pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The fleet of theſe adventurers was therefore formidable; and, as Robertſon ſays, ſoon became terrible from the ſtraits of the Dardanelles to thoſe of Gibralter. The proſpects of ambition increaſe, as man aſcends its ſummit. Horrie, the elder brother, ſurnamed Barbaroſſa, as ſome aſſert, from the red colour of his beard, aſpired to the attainment of ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign power upon land; and a favourable opportunity ſoon offered of gratifying his pride. His frequent intercourſe with the Barbary States induced an acquaintance with Eutimi, then king of Algiers, who was then at war with Spain, and had made ſeveral unſucceſsful attacks upon a ſmall fort, built by that nation on the Oran. In his diſtreſs, this king inconſiderately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Barbaroſſa, for aſſiſtance, who readily embraced the invitation, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted himſelf like more modern allies.
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:032945_0312_0FF5C41BB650F3F8"/>
He firſt aſſiſted this weak king againſt his enemy, and then ſacrificed him to his own ambition; for, leaving his brother Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raddin to command the fleet, he entered the city of Algiers, at the head of five thouſand men, was received by the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants, as their deliverer, aſſiſted them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Spaniards, and then arreſted and diſarmed the principal people, ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly murdered the unſuſpecting Eutimi, and cauſed himſelf to be proclaimed king of Algiers. Laviſh of his treaſures to his adherents, and cruelly vindictive to thoſe, he diſtruſted, he not only eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his government, but dethroned the neighbouring king of Temecien, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed his dominions to his own. But the brave Marquis de Comeſes, the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh governour of Oran, by the direction of the Emperour Charles the fifth, aſſiſted the dethroned king; and, after defeating Barbaroſſa in ſeveral bloody battles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged him in Temecien, the capital of
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:032945_0313_0FF5EC19C5060A90"/>
that kingdom, where this ferocious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturer was ſlain in attempting his eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape, but ſought his purſuers with a bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal rage, becoming the ferocity of his life. Upon the death of Barbaroſſa, his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Hayraddin aſſumed the ſame name, and the kingdom of Algiers. This Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baroſſa is better known to the European annaliſt for rendering his dominions trib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utary to the Grand Seignior. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged his power with a body of the Turk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ſoldiers; and, being promoted to the command of the Turkiſh fleet, he ſpread the fame of the Ottoman power through all Europe: for though obliged by the ſuperiour power of the Emperour Charles fifth to relinquiſh his conqueſt of Tunis, which he had effected by a ſimilar treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, with which his brother had poſſeſſed himſelf of Algiers; yet his being the acknowledged rival of Andrew Doria, the firſt ſea commander of his age, has laurelled his brow among thoſe, who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:032945_0314_0FF5EBE362769DD8"/>
glory to conſiſt in carnage. This Barbaroſſa built a mole for the protection of the harbour of Algiers, in which, it is ſaid, he employed thirty thouſand chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſlaves, and died a natural death, and was ſucceeded by Haſſan Aga, a renega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do from Sardinia, elected by the ſoldiers, but confirmed by the Grand Seignior, who, taking an advantage of a violent ſtorm, which wrecked the navy of the Emperour Charles fifth, who had invaded his territories, drove that proud emperour from the coaſt, defeated the rear of his army, and captured ſo many of his ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, that the Algerines, it is reported, ſold many of their priſoners by way of contempt, at the price of an onion per head. Another Haſſan, ſon to the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond Barbaroſſa, ſucceeded and defeated the Spaniards, who invaded his domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions under the command of the Count de Alcandara, killed that nobleman, and took above twelve thouſand priſoners.
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:032945_0315_0FF5EC1C79B9DCD0"/>
But his ſucceſſour, Mahomet, merited the moſt of his country, when, by ingratiat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with the Turkiſh ſoldiers, by incorporating them with his own troops, he annihilated the conteſts of theſe fierce rivals, formed a permanent body of brave, diſciplined troops, and enabled his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour to renounce that dependence upon the Grand Seignior, to which the ſecond Barbaroſſa had ſubmitted.</p>
                     <p>In ſixteen hundred and nine, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines received a vaſt acceſſion of ſtrength and numbers from the emigrant Moors, whom the weak policy of Spain had driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to their dominions. Embittered by chriſtian ſeverity, the Moors flocked on board the Algerine veſſels, and ſought a deſperate revenge upon all, who bore the chriſtian name. Their fleet was ſaid to conſiſt, at this period, of upwards of forty ſhips, from two to four hundred tons burthen. Though the French with that gallantry, which diſtinguiſhed them
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:032945_0316_0FF5EBE5730A15F8"/>
under their monarchs, undertook to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge the cauſe of Europe and chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; and, in ſixteen hundred and ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteen, ſent a fleet of fifty ſhips of war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, who ſunk the Algerine ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miral and diſperſed his fleet; yet this bold people were ſo elated, by their acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of numbers and riches, that they committed wanton and indiſcriminate outrage, on the perſon and property of all nations, violating the treaties made by the Grand Seignior, ſeizing the ſhips of thoſe powers, with which he was in alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, even in his own ports; and, after plundering Scandaroon in Syria, an Ot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toman city, they, in ſixteen hundred and twenty three, threw off their depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on the ſublime Porte. In ſixteen hundred and thirty ſeven, the Algerine rovers entered the Britiſh channel, and made ſo many captures that, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, near five thouſand Engliſh were made priſoners by them; and, in the
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:032945_0317_0FF5EC1E99C33700"/>
ſame year, they diſpatched Hall Pinchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin with ſixteen gallies to rob the rich chapel of our lady of Loretto; which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſucceſsful, they ravaged the ſhores of the Adriatic, and ſo enraged the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians, that they fitted out a fleet of twenty eight ſail, under the command of Admiral Cappello, who, by a late treaty with the Porte, had liberty to enter any of its harbours, to deſtroy the Algerine gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. Cappello was ordered by the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians to ſink, burn, and deſtroy, without mercy, all the corſairs of the enemy, and he bravely and ſucceſsfully executed his commiſſion. He immediately overtook and defeated Pinchinin, diſabled five of his gallies; and, this Algerine retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Valona and landing his booty, where he erected batteries for its defence, the brave Cappello manned his boats and ſmall craft, and captured his whole fleet. In theſe actions, about twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Algerines were ſlain; and, what
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:032945_0318_0FF5EBE8212B0EF0"/>
was more pleaſing, ſixteen hundred chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian galley ſlaves ſet at liberty. Hiſtory affords no inſtance of a people, ſo repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly and ſuddenly recovering their loſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, as the Algerines. Within a few years, we find them fitting out ſeventy ſail of armed veſſels, and making ſuch daring and deſperate attacks upon the commerce of nations, that the moſt haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty maritime powers of Europe were more anxious, to ſhelter themſelves under a treaty and pay an humiliating tribute, than to attempt nobly to reduce them to reaſon and humanity. But, after many ineffectual attempts had been made to unite the force of Europe againſt them, the gallant French, by the command of Louis fourteenth, again rouſed themſelves to chaſten this intractable race. In ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred and eighty two, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis du Queſne, with a large fleet and ſeveral bomb ketches, reached Algiers; and, with his ſea mortars, bombarded it ſo
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:032945_0319_0FF5EC201F64D1C8"/>
violently that, he laid almoſt the whole city in ruins. Whether his orders went no further, or the vice admiral judged he had chaſtiſed them ſufficiently, or wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er a violent ſtorm drove his fleet from its moorings, does not appear. But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that he left the city abruptly; and the Algerines, to revenge this inſult, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent their fleet to the coaſt of France, and took ſignal reparation.</p>
                     <p>The next year, Du Queſne caſt anchor before Algiers with a larger fleet; and, for forty eight hours, made ſuch deadly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges with his cannon, and ſhowered ſo many bombs over this devoted city, that the Dey ſued for peace.</p>
                     <p>The French admiral with that gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity, which is peculiar to his nation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, as an indiſpenſable preliminary, that all the chriſtian ſlaves ſhould be ſent on board his ſquadron, with Mezemorto the Dey's admiral, as a hoſtage for the performance of this preliminary article.
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:032945_0320_0FF5EBEA390434E8"/>
The Dey aſſembled his divan, or council of great officers, and communicated the French demands. Mezemorto immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately collected the ſailors, who had man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the ramparts, and with whom he was a favourite; and, accuſing the Dey of cowardice, he ſo inflamed them that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joined by the ſoldiers, they murdered the Dey, and elected Mezemorto in his ſtead. This was a ſignal for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed hoſtility, and never was there a ſcene of greater carnage. The French ſeemed to have reſerved their fire for this moment, when they poured ſuch inceſſant vollies of red hot ſhot, bombs, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes into the city, that it was nearly all in flames. The ſtreets run blood, while the politic and furious Mezemorto, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a change in the public mind, and conſcious that another ceſſation of arms would be attended with his death or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery to the French, ran furiouſly round the ramparts and exhorted the military to
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:032945_0321_0FF5EC21A4853670"/>
their duty; and, to make his new ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects deſperate, cauſed all the French ſlaves to be murdered; and, ſeizing the French conſul, who had been a priſoner among them, ſince the firſt declaration of war, he ordered him to be tied hand and foot, and placed over a bomb mortar and ſhot into the air towards the French fleet. The French were ſo highly enraged, the ſailors could ſcarce be prevented from attempting to land, and deſtroy this barbarous race. The vice admiral contented himſelf with levelling their fortifications, reducing the city to rubbiſh, and burning their whole fleet. A fair opportunity now preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of preventing the Algerines from again moleſting commerce. If the European maritime powers had by treaty engaged themſelves to deſtroy the firſt armed gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of the Algerines, which appeared up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſeas, and conjointly forbidden them to repair their fortifications; this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple might ere this have from neceſſity
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:032945_0322_0FF5EBEBC182B418"/>
turned their attention to commerce; the miſcreants and outcaſts of other nations would have no longer found refuge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them; and this people might at this time have been as celebrated for the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful arts, as they are odious for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant violation of the laws of nations and humanity. This was ſurely the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon intereſt of the European powers; but to talk of their common intereſt is idle. The narrow politics of Europe ſeek an individual not a common good; for no ſooner had France humbled the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines than England thought it more for her intereſt to enter into a treaty with the new Dey, and, by way of douceur, ſent to Algiers a ſhip load of naval and military ſtores, to help them to rebuild their navy and ſtrengthen their fortreſſes; while France, jealous leſt the affections of the monſter Mezemorto, who barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly murdered their fellow citizens, ſhould be attached to their rival the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:032945_0323_0FF5EC24951A5418"/>
immediately patched up a peace with the Algerines upon the moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able terms to the latter; and, to conclude the farce, ſent them another ſhip load of ſimilar materials of ſuperiour value to thoſe, preſented by the Engliſh. This, my readers, is a ſmall ſpecimen of Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pean policy.</p>
                     <p>The lateſt authentic account of any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack upon the Algerines was on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty third of June, one thouſand ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſeventy five; when the Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iards ſent the Count O'Rally with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable fleet, twenty four thouſand land forces, and a prodigious train of artillery, to deſtroy the city. The count landed about two thirds of his troops, about a league and an half to the eaſtward of the city; but, upon marching into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, they were oppoſed by an immenſe army of natives. The Spaniards ſay, it conſiſted of one hundred and fifty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, probably exaggerated by their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions.
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:032945_0324_0FF5EBED4F3BB820"/>
This is certain, they had force ſufficient, or ſuperiour ſkill to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat the Spaniards, who retreated to their ſhips with the loſs of thirteen cannon, ſome howitzers, and three thouſand killed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides priſoners; while they deſtroyed ſix thouſand Algerines. No ſooner had the treaty of Paris, in one thouſand ſeven hundred and eighty two, completely lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erated the United States from their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon the Britiſh nation than that haughty, exaſperated power, anxious to ſhew their late coloniſts the value of that protection, under which their veſſels had heretofore navigated the Mediterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean, excited the Algerines to capture the ſhipping of the United States, who, following from neceſſity the policy of European nations, concluded a treaty with this piratical ſtate on the fifth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety five.</p>
                     <p>Thus I have delineated a ſketch of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerine

hiſtory from actual information, obtained upon the ſpot, and the beſt Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean authorities. This dry detail of facts will probably be paſſed over by thoſe, who read for mere amuſement, but the intelligent reader will, in this conciſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moir, trace the leading principles of this deſpotic government; will account for the avarice and rapacity of a people, who live by plunder; perceive whence it is that they are thus ſuffered to injure commerce and outrage humanity; and juſtify our executive in concluding, what ſome uninformed men may eſteem, a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating, and too dearly purchaſed peace with theſe free booters.</p>

                        <p>Deſcription of the City of Algiers.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I CANNOT give ſo particular a deſcription of this city, as I could wiſh, or my readers may deſire. Perhaps no town contains ſo many places impervious to ſtrangers. The interiour of the Dey's palace, and the female apartment of every houſe are ſecluded even from the natives. No one approaches them but their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive maſters, while no ſtranger is permitted to inſpect the fortifications; and the moſques, or churches, are ſcrupulouſly guarded from the polluted ſteps of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believer. A poor ſlave, branded as an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:032945_0327_0FF5EC28D7DD19B0"/>
would obtain only general information from a reſidence in the midſt of them.</p>
                     <p>Algiers is ſituated in the bay of that name, and built upon the ſea ſhore, an eminence, which riſes above it, and which naturally gave the diſtinction of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and lower city. Towards the ſea, it is ſtrengthened with vaſt fortifications, which are continued upon the mole, which ſecures the port from ſtorms and aſſaults. I never perambulated it, but ſhould judge that, a line drawn from the weſt arm of the mole, and extended by land, until it terminated on the eaſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the buildings, would meaſure about two miles. It contains one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty moſques, two hundred and twenty public baths, and innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble coffee houſes. The moſques are large ſtone buildings, not lofty in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to their extent on the ground, and have uſually erected, upon their corners, ſmall ſquare towers or minarets, whence
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:032945_0328_0FF5EBF30E339AD8"/>
the inferiour prieſts call the people to prayers. The baths are convenient buildings, lighted on the top, provided with cold and warm waters, which you mingle at your pleaſure, in ſmall marble ciſterns, by the aſſiſtance of braſs cocks. Every bather pays two rials at his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, for which he is accommodated with a dreſſing room, contiguous to the bathing ciſtern, towels, fleſh bruſhes, and other conveniences, a glaſs of ſherbet, and an aſſiſtant, if he chooſes. The coffee houſes or rooms are generally piazzas, with an opening over them, projecting from the front of the houſes into the ſtreets. Here the inhabitants delight to loll, to drink ſherbet, ſip coffee, and chew opium, or ſmoak tobacco, ſteeped in a decoction of this exhilarating drug.</p>
                     <p>I have already ſketched a deſcription of the houſes, and ſhall only add, that the roofs are nearly flat with a ſmall declivity to caſt the rain water into ſpouts. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giers
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:032945_0329_0FF5EC2AEFFE1E18"/>
is tolerably well ſupplied with ſpring water, conveyed in pipes from the back country; but the Algerines, who are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderately attached to bathing, prefer rain water, as beſt adapted to that uſe, conſidering it a luxury in compariſon with that, obtained from the ſprings or ſea.</p>
                     <p>The inhabitants ſay, Algiers contains twenty thouſand houſes, one hundred and forty thouſand believers, twenty two thouſand Jews, and ſix thouſand chriſtian ſlaves. I ſuſpect, Algerine vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has exaggerated the truth; but I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contradict it. Immediately before the cenſus of the inhabitants of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, I am told, perſons, who poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much better means of calculation, miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the population of the principal towns moſt egregiouſly.</p>

                        <p>The Government of the Algerines.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IT has been noticed that Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raddin Barbaroſſa, in the beginning of the ſixteenth century, rendered his kingdom tributary to the Grand Seignior; and that, in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and twenty three, the Algerines threw off their dependence on the ſublime Porte. Since that time, the Turkiſh court have made ſeveral attempts to reduce the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines to their ſubjection; and, by ſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the numerous pretenders to the regency, ſo common in this unſtable gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, they have, at times, apparently effected their deſign: while the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, by aſſaſſinating or dethroning thoſe
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:032945_0331_0FF5EC2D166A4FD0"/>
princes, whoſe weakneſs or wants have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced them to ſubmit to extraneous power, have reduced their dependence on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Porte to a mere name. At preſent, the Grand Seignior, fearful of loſing the very ſhadow of authority, he has over them, contents himſelf with receiving a tribute al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt nominal; conſiſting chiefly of a preſent, towards defraying the expenſes of the annual canopy, which is ſent to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn the prophet's tomb at Medina: while, on the other hand, the Algerines, dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Grand Seignior's interference in their popular commotions, allow the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime Porte to confirm the election of their Dey, and to badge his name, by affixing and terminating it with thoſe of the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officers of the Turkiſh government. Hence the preſent Dey, whoſe real name is Haſſan, is ſtyled Vizier, which is alſo the appellation of the Grand Seignior's firſt miniſter. As Baſhaw, which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates the Dey's name, is the Turkiſh
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:032945_0332_0FF5EBF6AC185098"/>
title of their viceroys and principal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, he makes war or peace, negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates treaties, coins money, and performs every other act of abſolute independence.</p>
                     <p>Nor is the Dey leſs independent of his own ſubjects. Though he obtains his office frequently by the election of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſoldiery, and wades to the regency through the blood of his predeceſſor; yet he is no ſooner inveſted with the inſignia of office, than, an implicit reverence is paid to his commands, even by his fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious electors; and, though he often ſummons his divan or council of great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, yet they are merely adviſory. He conducts foreign affairs, at his own good pleaſure; and, as to internal, he knows no reſtraint, except from certain local cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, opinions, and tenets, which he himſelf venerates, in common with his meaneſt ſubjects. Juſtice is adminiſtered in his name. He even determines controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies in his own perſon, beſides being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:032945_0333_0FF5EC2FC9F178A0"/>
virtually preſent in the perſons of his cadis or judges. If he inclines to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere in the determination of a ſuit, upon his approach, the authority of the cadis ceaſe, and is merged in that of the Dey. Some cuſtoms have been intimated, which reſtrain the Dey's deſpotiſm. Theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late principally to religion, property, and females. He will not condemn a prieſt to death; and, although up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the deceaſe of a ſubject, his landed property immediately eſcheats to the reigning Dey, yet he never ſeizes it, in the life of the poſſeſſor; and, when a man is executed for the higheſt crime, the females of his family are treated with reſpect; nay, even in an inſurrection of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diery, when they murdered their Dey, neither they nor his ſucceſſour violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the female apartments of the ſlain. A mere love of novelty in the ſoldiery, the wiſh to ſhare the largeſſes of a new ſovereign, the policy of his courtiers,
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:032945_0334_0FF5EBF82F7F87D8"/>
the ambition or popularity of his officers or children, have not unfrequently cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dethroning of the Dey; but the more ſyſtematic cauſe of his being ſo frequently dethroned ſhall be noticed in our next chapter.</p>

                        <p>Revenue.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Dey's revenue is ſtated by writers at ſeven hundred thouſand dollars per annum. If the limits of this work would permit, I think I could prove it under rated, from a view of his expenditures. It ariſes from a ſlight tax up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſubjects, a tribute from ſome Moors and tribes of Arabs, in the interiour country; a capitation tax upon the Jews; prizes taken at ſea; preſents from foreign powers, as the price of peace; annual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidies from thoſe nations, with whom he is in alliance; and cuſtomary preſents made by his courtiers on his birth day,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:032945_0336_0FF5EBFB6D758320"/>
To theſe may be added ſums, ſqueezed from his Baſhaws in the government of the interiour provinces, and from the Jews, as the price of their protection. With theſe ſupplies he has to ſupport the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificene of his court, defray the expenſe of foreign embaſſies, pay his army, ſupply his navy, and repair his fortifications; and, by frequent gratuities, if he is not ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſucceſsful and popular, ſupport his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt among thoſe, who have the power to dethrone him. His proportion of the prizes, captured at ſea, and the concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory preſents, made by the commercial powers, are the principal ſources of his revenue. It is obviouſly the policy of the Dey, by frequently enfringing his treaties, to augment his finances, by new captures or freſh premiums for his friendſhip. A pacific Dey is ſure not to reign long; for, beſide the diſguſt of the formidable body of ſailors, who are emulous of employ, when the reigning Dey has once gone
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:032945_0337_0FF5EC33627F8718"/>
through the routine of ſeizing the veſſels, receiving the preſents, and concluding treaties with the uſual foreign powers, he finds that the annual payments, ſecured by treaties, are inſufficient for the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of his neceſſary expenditures; and is therefore conſtrained frequently to declare war as a principle of ſelf preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ervation. I have been told, the preſent Dey condeſcended to explain theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to an American agent in Algiers, and grounded his capturing the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can ſhipping upon this neceſſity. I muſt, ſaid the Dey, be at war with ſome nation, and yours muſt have its turn. When the Dey, from a pacific diſpoſition or dread of foreign power, is at peace with the world, the diſguſted ſailor and avaricious ſoldier join to dethrone him; having eſtabliſhed it, as a maxim, that all treaties expire with the reigning Dey, and muſt be renewed with his ſucceſſour. This is undoubredly the
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:032945_0338_0FF5EBFDAA084100"/>
true ſource whence ſpring thoſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and dreadful convulſions, in the regency of Algiers.</p>

                     <p>THERE are but few veſſels actually belonging to the Dey's navy. He has many marine officers, who rank in the ſea ſervice; but, except on great expeditions, are permitted to command the gallies of private adventurers; and it is theſe picaroons, that make ſuch dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful depredations on commerce. I can give but a ſlender account of his land forces. Thoſe in eſtabliſhed pay are ſaid to amount to about eight thouſand foot, and two thouſand Mooriſh horſe. To
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:032945_0340_0FF5EBFF30CB9F78"/>
theſe may be added four thouſand inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of the city, who enrol themſelves as ſoldiers, for protection in military tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, receive no pay, but are liable to be called upon to man the fortifications in emergency, inſurrection, or invaſion. Perhaps there are more of this ſpecies in the provinces. The horſe are cantoned in the country round the city, and do du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by detachments at the palace. Three thouſand foot are ſtationed in the fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, and marſhalled as the Dey's guards. The reſidue of the land forces are diſtributed among the Baſhaws to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verawe the provinces. But the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal reliance, in caſe of invaſion, is the vaſt bodies of what may be ſtyled mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia, which the Baſhaws, in caſe of emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency, lead from the interiour country.</p>

Over their ſhirt a linen or ſilk gown, which is girded about their loins by a ſaſh, in the choice of which they exhibit much fancy. In this dreſs their legs and lower extrem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of their arms are bare. As an outer garment, a looſe coat of coarſer materials is thrown over the whole. They wear turbans, which are long pieces of muſlin
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:032945_0342_0FF5EC01D6472BB8"/>
or ſilk curiouſly folded, ſo as to form a cap comfortable and ornamental. Slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers are uſually worn, though the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers are provided with a ſort of buſkin, reſembling our half boots. The dreſs of the women, I am told, for I never had the pleaſure of inſpecting it very critical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, reſembles that of the men, except that their drawers are longer, and their out ſide garment is like our old faſhioned riding hoods. When the ladies walk the ſtreets, they are muffled with bandages or hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchiefs of muſlin or ſilk over their faces, which conceals all but their eyes; and, if too nearly inſpected, will let fall a large vail, which conceals them intirely. The men u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſually ſet croſs legged upon mattreſſes, laid upon low ſeats at the ſides of the room. They loll on cuſhions at their meals; and, after their repaſts, occaſionally indulge with a ſhort ſlumber. I have ſuch a lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble attachment to the cuſtoms of my own country, that I doubt whether I can
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:032945_0343_0FF5EC39B82E9D38"/>
judge candidly of their cookery or mode of eating. The former would be unpal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atable and the latter diſguſting to moſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans; for ſaffron is their common ſeaſoning. They cook their proviſions to rags or pap, and eat it with their fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, though the better ſort uſe ſpoons. Their diverſions conſiſt in aſſociating in the coffee houſes, in the city, and, in the country, under groves, where they ſmoke and chat, and drink cooling not inebri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating liquors. Their more active amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are riding and throwing the dart, at both which they are very expert. They ſometimes play at cheſs and drafts, but never at games of chance or for mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey; thoſe being expreſsly forbidden by the alcoran.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>IT is the privilege of travellers to exaggerate; but I wiſh not o avail myſelf of this preſcriptive right. I had rather diſappoint the curioſity of my readers by conciſeneſs, than diſguſt them with untruths. I have no ambition to be
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:032945_0345_0FF5EC3C12F4D820"/>
ranked among the Bruces and Chaſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reux of the age. I ſhall therefore endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our rather to improve the underſtanding of my reader, with what I really know, than amuſe him with ſtories, of which my circumſcribed ſituation rendered me neceſſarily ignorant. I never was at an Algerine marriage; but obtained ſome authentic information on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>That extreme caution, which ſeparates the ſexes in elder life, is alſo attached to the youth. In Algiers, the young peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple never collect to dance, converſe, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe themſelves with the innocent gaities of their age. Here are no theatres, balls, or concerts; and, even in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic duties of religion, the ſexes never aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together. An Algerine courtſhip would be as diſagreeable to the hale youth of New England, as a common bundling would be diſguſting to the Muſſulman. No opportunity is afforded to the young ſuitor to ſearch for thoſe nameleſs bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:032945_0346_0FF5EC056D76B7B8"/>
qualities and attentions, which attach the American youth to his miſtreſs, and form the baſis of connubial bliſs; nor is the young Algerine permitted, by a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand tender aſſiduities, to win the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the future partner of his life. His choice can be only directed by the rank or reſpectability of the father of his intended bride. He never ſees her face, until after the nuptial ceremony is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed; and even ſome days after ſhe has been brought home to his own houſe. The old people frequently make the match, or, if it originates with the youth, he conſides his wiſhes to his father or ſome reſpectable relation, who communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates the propoſal to the lady's father. If he receives it favourably, the young couple are allowed to exchange ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning meſſages, by an old nurſe of the family. The bride's father or her next male kin, with the bridegroom, go before the Cadi and ſign a contract of marriage,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:032945_0347_0FF5EC3DB1633428"/>
which is atteſted by the relatives on each ſide. The bridegroom then pays a ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulated ſum to the bride' father; the nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ceremony is performed in private, and the bridegroom retires. After ſome days, the bride is richly arrayed, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by females, and conveyed in a covered coach or waggon, gaudy with flowers, to her huſband's houſe. Here ſhe is immediately immured in the wom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en's apartments, while the bridegroom and his friends ſhare a convivial feaſt. After ſome ceremonies, the nature of which I could not diſcover, the bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom enters the women's apartment, and for the firſt time diſcovers whether his wife has a noſe or eyes. Among the higher ranks, it is ſaid, the bride, after the expiration of a month, goes to the public bath for women, is there receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great parade, and loaded with preſents by her female relations, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled on the occaſion. The bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:032945_0348_0FF5EC079A8A8670"/>
alſo receives preſents from his friends.</p>
                     <p>Within a limited time, the huſband may break the contract, provided he will add another item to that already given, return his bride with all her parapherna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia; and, putting the holy alcoran to his breaſt, aſſert that he never benefited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of the rights of an huſband.</p>
                     <p>Notwithſtanding the apparent reſtraint, the women are under, they are ſaid to be attached to their huſbands, and enjoy greater liberty than is generally conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I certainly ſaw many women in the ſtreets, ſo muffled up, and ſo ſimilar from their outward garment, that their neareſt relatives could not diſtinguiſh one from another. The vulgar ſlaves conjecture that the women take great liberties in this general diſguiſe.</p>
                     <p>Their funerals are decent but not oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentatious. I ſaw many. The corps, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upon a bier, is preceded by the prieſts,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:032945_0349_0FF5EC407829EE00"/>
chanting paſſages from the alcoran in a dolorous tone. Wherever the proceſſion paſſes, the people join in this dirge. The relatives follow, with the folds of their turbans looſened. The bodies of the rich are depoſited in vaults, thoſe of the poor, in graves. A pillar of marble is erected over them, with an unblown roſe carved on the top for the unmarried.</p>
                     <p>At certain ſeaſons, the women of the family join a proceſſion in cloſe habits, and proceed to the tomb or grave, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn it with garlands of flowers. When theſe proceſſions paſs, the ſlaves are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to throw themſelves on the ground with their faces in the duſt, and all, of whatever rank, cover their faces.</p>

                        <p>The Religion of the Algerines: Life of the Prophet Mahomet.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>IN deſcribing the religious ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of the Algerines, the attention is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately drawn to Mahomet or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homed, the founder of their faith.</p>
                     <p>This fortunate impoſtor, like all other great characters in the drama of life, has been indignantly vilified by his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, and as ardently praiſed by his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents. I ſhall endeavour to ſteer the middle courſe of impartiality; neither influenced by the biggoted averſion of
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:032945_0351_0FF5EC4287001958"/>
Sales and Prideaux, or the ſpecious praiſe of the <hi>philoſophic Boulanvilliers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Mahomet was born in the five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty ninth year of the chriſtian era. He was deſcended from the Coreis, one of the nobleſt of the Arabian tribes. His father, Abdalla, was a man of moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate fortune, and beſtowed upon his ſon ſuch an education as a parent in confined, if not impoveriſhed circumſtances, could confer. The Turks ſay, he could not write; becauſe they pride themſelves in decrying letters, and becauſe the pious among them ſuppoſe his ignorance of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a ſufficient evidence of the divine o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal of the book, he publiſhed, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from and written by the finger of Deity.</p>
                     <p>But when the Arabian authors record, that he was employed as a factor by his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle Abutileb, there can little doubt remain but that he was poſſeſſed of all the litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acquirements, neceſſary to accompliſh
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:032945_0352_0FF5C41A2836F7B8"/>
him for his buſineſs. He has been ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized as a mere camel driver. He had the direction of camels it is true. The merchandize of Arabia was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to different regions by carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vans of theſe uſeful animals, of a troop of which he was conductor; but there was as much difference between his ſtation and employment, and that of a common camel driver, as between the ſupercargo of an India ſhip in our days, and the ſeaman before the maſt. In his capacity of factor, he travelled into Syr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ia, Paleſtine, and Egypt; and acquired the moſt uſeful knowledge in each coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. He is repreſented as a man of a beautiful perſon, and commanding preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. By his engaging manners and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable attention to buſineſs, he became the factor of a rich Arabian merchant, after whoſe death he married his widow, the beautiful Cadija, and came into the lawful poſſeſſion of immenſe wealth, which
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:032945_0353_0FF5EC44B6F35260"/>
awakened in him the moſt unbounded ambition. By the venerable cuſtom of his nation, his political career was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to his own tribe; and, the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archal being the prominent feature of the Arabian government, he could not hope to ſurmount the claims of elder families, even in his own tribe, the genealogies of which were accurately preſerved. To be the founder and prophet of a new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would ſecure a glorious preemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, highly gratifying to his ambition, and not thwarting the pretenſions of the tribes.</p>
                     <p>Mankind are apt to impute the moſt profound abilities to ſounders of religious ſyſtems, and other fortunate adventurers, when perhaps they owe their ſucceſs more to a fortunate coincidence of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and their only merit is the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacity to avail themſelves of that tide in the affairs of men, which leads to wealth and honour. Perhaps there never was a
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:032945_0354_0FF5EC0E3B8A9590"/>
conjuncture more favourable for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of a new religion than that, of which Mahomet availed himſelf. He was ſurrounded by Arian chriſtians, whoſe darling creed is the unity of the Deity, and who had been perſecuted by the Athenaſians into an abhorrence of almoſt every other chriſtian tenet: by Jews, who had fled from the vindictive Emperour Adrian, and who, too willful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blind to ſee the accompliſhment of their prophecies in the perſon of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in the midſt of exile were ready to contemn thoſe prophecies, which had ſo long deluded them with a Meſſiah, who nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er came: and by Pagans, whoſe belief in a plurality of gods made them the ready proſelytes of any novel ſyſtem; and the more wiſe of whom were diſguſted with the groſs adſurdities of their own mythol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ogy. The ſyſtem of Mahomet is ſaid to have been calculated to attach all theſe. To gratify the Arian and the Jew, he
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:032945_0355_0FF5EC4783DD8468"/>
maintained the unity of God; and, to pleaſe the Pagans, he adopted many of their external rites, as faſtings, waſhings, . Certain it is, he ſpoke of Moſes and the patriarchs, as meſſengers from heaven, and that he declared Jeſus Chriſt to be the true Meſſias, and the exemplary pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of a good life, a ſentiment critically expreſſing the Arian opinion. The ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Mahomet's having retired to a cave with a monk and a Jew to compile his book; and falling into fits of the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lepſy, perſuading his diſciples that theſe ſits were trances in order to propagate his ſyſtem more effectually, ſo often related by geography compilers, like the tales of Pope Joan and the nag's head conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Engliſh biſhops, are fit only to amuſe the vulgar. It is certain, he ſeclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf from company and aſſumed an auſterity of manners, becoming the reformer of a vicious world. In his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, he commenced writing the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coran.
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:032945_0356_0FF5EC0FC78D0778"/>
His firſt proſelytes were of his own family, the next, of his near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. But the tribe of Corei were ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with the perſon and life of Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met that they deſpiſed his pretenſions; and, fearful leſt what they ſtyled his mad enthuſiaſm ſhould bring a ſtigma upon their tribe, they firſt attempted to reaſon him out of his ſuppoſed deluſion; and, this failing, they ſought to deſtroy him. But a ſpecial meſſenger of heaven, who, Mahomet ſays, meaſured ten million fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs at every ſtep, informed him of their deſign, and he fled to Medina, the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of which, being already prepoſſeſſed in favour of his doctrine, received him with great reſpect. <note n="*" place="bottom">This flight was in the ſix hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſecond year of the chriſtian era, when Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met was fifty four years of age. The Mahome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan of all ſectaries commence their computation of time from this period, which they ſtyle the <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gira,</hi> or flight.</note>

He ſoon inſpired them with the moſt implicit confidence in the divinity of his miſſion, and confirmed their faith by dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly portions of the alcoran, which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared was written by the finger of God, and tranſmitted to him immediately from heaven by archangels, commiſſioned for that important purpoſe. He declared himſelf the <hi>Sent of God,</hi> the ſword of his almighty power, commiſſioned to enforce the unity of the divine eſſence, the unchangea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of his eternal decrees, the future bliſs of true believers, and the torment of the damned, among the nations. He boldly pronounced all thoſe who died fighting in his cauſe, to be entitled to the glory of martyrs in the heavenly paradiſe; and, availing himſelf of ſome of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſeuds among the neighbouring tribes, cauſed his diſciples in Medina to wage war upon their neighbours, and they invariably conquered, when he headed their troops. The tribe of Corei
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:032945_0358_0FF5EC1320464C70"/>
flattered by the honours, paid their kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and confounded by the repeated reports of his victories, were ſoon proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyted, and become afterwards the moſt enthuſiaſtic ſupporters of his power. In ſix hundred and twenty ſeven, he was crowned ſovereign at Medina, like the divine Malchiſedec uniting in his perſon the high titles of prophet and king. He ſubdued the greater part of Arabia, and obtained a reſpectable footing in Syria. He died at Medina in the year ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and thirty three, and in the ſixty fourth year of his age. European writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, who have deſtroyed almoſt as many great perſonages by poiſon as the French have with the guillotine, have attributed his death to a doſe adminiſtered by a monk. But when we conſider his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced age and public energies, we need not recur to any but natural means for the cauſe of his death.</p>

                     <p>UPON the deceaſe of the prophet, his followers were almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. They could ſcarce credit their ſenſes. They fancied him only in a ſwoon, and waited in reſpectful ſilence until he ſhould again ariſe to lead them to conqueſt and glory.

In the alcoran, they found no direction for the election, nor any ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſour to the caliphate pointed out.

They agreed to ſend for his wives and confidential domeſtics. The youngeſt of his wives produced ſome writings, containing the precious ſayings of the prophet, which, ſhe ſaid, ſhe had collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her own edification. To theſe were afterwards added ſuch obſervations of the prophet, as his more intimate aſſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates could recollect, or the policy of thoſe in power invent. Theſe were annexed to the alcoran, and eſteemed of equal au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. This compilation was called the book of the companions of the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. In the writings, produced by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite wife, the prophet had directed his great officers to elect his ſucceſſour from among them, and aſſured them that a portion of his own power would reſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. Abubeker, a friend and relative, and ſucceſsful leader of the forces of the Prophet, by the perſuaſions of thoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round, immediately entered the public moſque; and, ſtanding on the ſteps of
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:032945_0361_0FF5EC4CB5CE8940"/>
the deſk, from which the prophet uſed to deliver his oracles, he informed the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude that God had indeed called the prophet to paradiſe, and that his kingly authority and apoſtolic powers reſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. To him ſucceeded Omar and Oſman: while the troops in Syria, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that Ali, their leader, was better entitled to ſucceed than either, elevated him alſo to the caliphate, though he refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the dignity until he was called by the voice of the people to ſucceed Oſman. Hence ſprang that great ſchiſm, which has divided the Muſſulman world; but, though divided, as to the ſucceſſour of the prophet, both parties were actuated by his principles and adhered to his creed. Omar and his ſucceſſours turned their arms towards Europe; and, under the name of Saracens or Moors, poſſeſſed themſelves of the greater part of Spain and the Mediterranean iſles: while the friends of Ali, eſtabliſhing themſelves as
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:032945_0362_0FF5EC841F10FCD8"/>
ſovereigns, made equal ravages upon Perſia, and even to the great peninſula of India.</p>
                     <p>The Algerines are of the ſect of Omar, which, like many other religious ſchiſms, differs more in name, than in any funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental point of creed or practice from that of Ali. The propriety of the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the alcoran into the Perſian lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the ſucceſſion of the caliphate ſeem the great ſtandards of their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive creeds.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>THE Algerine doctors aſſert, that the language of the alcoran is ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effably pure, it can never be rendered into any other tongue. To this they candidly impute the miſerable, vitiated tranſlations of the chriſtians, who they charge with having garbled the ſacred book, and degraded its ſublime alegories and metaphors into abſurd tales. This is certain, the portions, I have heard chanted at funerals and quoted in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, ever exhibited the pureſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:032945_0364_0FF5EC8637146338"/>
and the ſublimeſt conceptions of the Deity. The fundamental doctrine of the alcoran is the unity of God. The evil ſpirit, ſays the koran, is ſubtly deluding men, into the belief that there are more gods than one, that in the confuſion of deities he may obtain a ſhare of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; while the Supreme Being, pitying the deluſions of man, has ſent Abraham, Moſes, Soliman, breathed forth the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſias of the chriſtian in ſigh of divine pity, and laſtly ſent Mahomet, the ſeal of the prophets, to reclaim men to this eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential truth. The next fundamental points in the Muſſulman creed are a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the eternal decrees of God, in a reſurrection and final judgment to bliſs or miſery. Some hold with chriſtians that the future puniſhment will be infinite, while others ſuppoſe that, when the ſouls of the wicked are purified by fire, they will be received into the favour of God. They adhere to many other points of
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:032945_0365_0FF5EC52339AD0C0"/>
practical duty: ſuch as daily prayers, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent ablutions, acts of charity and ſevere faſtings; that of rhammadin, is the principal, which is ſimilar to the catholic lent, in abſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, for the penitent abſtains only from a particular kind of food, while he gluts himſelf with others perhaps more luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. The alcoran alſo forbids games of chance, and the uſe of ſtrong liquors; inculcates a tenderneſs for idiots, and a reſpect for age. The book of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of the apoſtle enjoins a pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to his tomb, to be made by the true believers once at leaſt in their lives: but though they view the authority, which enjoined this tedious journey divine, yet they have contrived to evade its rigour by allowing the believer to perform it by proxy or attorney.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, there does not appear to be any articles in their faith, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite them to immorality or can counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the cruelties, they commit. Neither
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:032945_0366_0FF5EC8850450618"/>
their alcoran nor their prieſts excite them to plunder, inſlave or torment. The former expreſsly recommends charity, juſtice, and mercy towards their fellow men. I would not bring the ſacred vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume of our faith in any comparative view with the alcoran of Mahomet; but I cannot help noticing it as extraordinary, that the Mahometan ſhould abominate the chriſtian on account of his faith, and the chriſtian deteſt the Muſſulman for his creed; when the koran of the former acknowledges the divinity of the chriſtian Meſſias, and the bible of the latter com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands us to love our enemies. If each would follow the obvious dictates of his own ſcripture, he would ceaſe to hate, abominate, and deſtroy the other.</p>

                        <p>Why do not the Powers in Europe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Algerine Depredations? is a Queſtion frequently aſked in the United States.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>I ANSWER, that this muſt be effected by a union of the European mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time powers with the Grand Seignior; by a combination among themſelves; or by an individual exertion of ſome particular ſtate. A union of the European powers with the Grand Seignior moſt probably would be attended with ſucceſs; but this is not to be expected; as it never can be the intereſt of the ſublime Porte to
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:032945_0368_0FF5EC8A69BBC6E0"/>
ſuppreſs them, and the common faith of the Muſſulman has more influence in uniting its profeſſors than the creed of the chriſtian, to the diſgrace of the <hi>latter:</hi> and, as the Grand Seignior's dominion over the Algerines is little more than nominal, he is anxious to conciliate their favour by affording them his protection; conſidering prudently, that though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable, they are ſtill a branch of the Muſſulman ſtock. Provoked by their inſults, he has ſometimes withdrawn his protection, as was the caſe, when he by treaty with the Venetians permitted their fleet to enter the Ottoman ports, for the expreſs purpoſe of deſtroying the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine gallies; but, it is obvious, the ſublime Porte meant merely to chaſtiſe not to ruin them.</p>
                     <p>In the Grand Seignior's wars with the Europeans, the piratical ſtates have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſignal ſervices, and he himſelf not unfrequently receives valuable douceurs
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:032945_0369_0FF5EC55F69BE390"/>
for exerting his ſuppoſed influence over them, in favour of one or another of the contending powers of Europe. In the ſiege of Gibraltar by the Spaniards, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the late American war, that garriſon received frequent ſupplies of proviſion from the Barbary Shore; but, by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Louis XVI. to the ſublime Porte, the Grand Seignior influenced the Barbary ſtates to prohibit thoſe ſupplies; and the Engliſh conſul was diſmiſſed from one of them with the moſt pointed marks of contempt. While the Grand Seign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior reaps ſuch ſolid advantages from them, it is abſurd to predicate upon his cooperation againſt them; neither can a union of the European powers be more fully anticipated. Jealouſy as often actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates mighty nations, as weak individuals. Whoever turns the pages of hiſtory with profit, will perceive that ſordid paſſion is the impulſe of action to the greateſt ſtates. Commercial ſtates are alſo actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:032945_0370_0FF5EC8D7789F0F8"/>
by avarice, a paſſion ſtill more bane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in its effects. Theſe excite war, and are the grand plenipotentiaries in the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtment of the articles of peace. Hence it is, that, while every European power is ſolicitous to enrich and aggrandize itſelf, it can never join in any common project, the reſult of which, it is jealous, may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage its neighbour; and is content to ſuffer injury, rather than its rival ſhould ſhare in a common good. Hence it is, that chriſtian ſtates, inſtead of uniting to vindicate their inſulted faith, join the croſs and the creſcent in unholy alliance, and form degrading treaties with piratical powers; and, as the acme of political folly, preſent thoſe very powers, as the purchaſe of their friendſhip, weapons to annoy themſelves in the firſt war, that their avarice or caprice ſhall wage. But, if ever a confederacy of the European powers ſhould be formed againſt the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerines, experience affords us but ſlender
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:032945_0371_0FF5EC5836E07640"/>
hopes of its ſucceſs; for, I will venture to aſſert, that from the confederacy of Ahab and Jehoſhaphat, when they went up to battle to Ramoth Gilead, to the treaty of Philnitz, there never was a combination of princes or nations, who, by an actual union of their forces, attained the object of their coalition. If the political finger is pointed to the war of the allies of Queen Anne, and the conqueſts of the Duke of Marlborough, as an exception, I likewiſe point to the diſtracting period, when that conqueror was ſuperceded by the Duke of Ormond, and the treaty of Utrecht will confirm the opinion I have advanced.</p>
                     <p>The detail of the hiſtory of the Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines evinces, that the arms of individual ſtates can be attended with no deciſive ſucceſs. Indeed, the expenſe of an effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious armament would defray the price of the Dey's friendſhip for years; and the powers of Europe ſubmit to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults and injuries from a principle of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy.
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:032945_0372_0FF5EC8F05DFCCA8"/>
An abſolute conqueſt of the Algerine territory cannot be effected but by invaſion from the interiour, through the cooperation of the Grand Seignior or the aſſiſtance of the other Barbary ſtates. The former I have ſhewn cannot be pred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icated, and the latter, for obvious rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, is as little to be expected. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent conqueſt of the city and port of Algiers cannot be effected, without the ſubjection of the interiour country. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary though ſpirited attacks, upon that city and port, have never anſwered any ſalutary purpoſe. They may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the deſtruction of our ſeaports, in our revolutionary war. The port at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked bore ſo ſmall a proportion to the whole, that its deſtruction rather ſerved to irritate, than to weaken or ſubjugate. It ſhould be conſidered, likewiſe, that the houſes of the Algerines are built of ſlight and cheap materials; that upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of an enemy the rich effects of the inhabitants are eaſily removed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:032945_0373_0FF5EC5B0DDF50B8"/>
while nothing remains but heavy fortifications to batter, and buildings, which can be readily reſtored, to deſtroy. The following anecdote will ſhew how ſenſible the Algerines themſelves are of theſe advantages. When the French vice admiral, the Marquis de Queſne, made his firſt attack on Algiers, he ſent an officer with a flag on ſhore, who magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the force of his commander, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened to lay the city in aſhes, if the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the marquis were not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately complied with. The Dey, who had, upon the firſt approach of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, removed the aged, the females and his richeſt effects, coolly inquired of the officer how much the levelling his city to aſhes would coſt. The officer, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to encreaſe the Dey's admiration of the power of the Grand Monarque, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, two millions of livres. Tell your commander, ſaid the Dey, if he will ſend me half the money I will burn the city of aſhes myſelf.</p>

                        <p>An Algerine Law Suit.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>AN officer of police parades the city at uncertain hours, and in all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, accompanied by an executioner and other attendants. The proceſs of his court is entirely verbal. He examines into all breaches of the cuſtoms, all frauds, eſpecially in weights and meaſures, all ſudden affrays, diſputes concerning per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal property, and compels the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of contracts. He determines cauſes on the ſpot, and the delinquent is puniſhed in his preſence. The uſual puniſhments, he inflicts, are fines, beating on the ſoles of the feet, diſmemberment
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:032945_0375_0FF5EC5C93D28A08"/>
of the right hand; and, it is ſaid, he has a power of taking life; but, in ſuch caſe, an appeal lies to the Dey. If complaint is made to him of the military, the prieſts or officers of the court navy, or cuſtoms, or againſt perſons attached to the families of the conſuls, envoys, or other repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives of foreign powers, upon ſuggeſtion, the cauſe is immediately reported to the Dey, who hears the ſame in perſon, or deputes ſome officer of rank to determine it, either from the civil, military, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious orders, as the nature of the cauſe may require. In fact, this officer of pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ice ſeldom judges any cauſe of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. The object of his commiſſion ſeems to be the detection and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of common cheats, and to ſuppreſs broils among the vulgar; and, as he has the power to adapt the puniſhment to the enormity of the offence, he often exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes it capriciouſly, and, ſometimes, ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crouſly. I ſaw a baker, who, for ſelling
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:032945_0376_0FF5EC929BCA74C8"/>
bread under weight, was ſentenced to walk the public market, three times each day, for three days in ſucceſſion, with a ſmall loaf, attached by a ring to each of his ears; and to cry aloud at ſhort diſtances <hi>"bread for the poor."</hi> This excited the reſentment of the rabble, who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with abundance of coarſe ridicule. Beſides this itinerant judge, there are many others, who never meddle with ſuits, unleſs they are brought formally before them, which is done by mere ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal complaint; they ſend for the parties and witneſſes, and determine almoſt as ſummarily as the officer of police. I confeſs that, when I left the United States, the golden fee, the lengthy bill of coſt, the law's delay, and the writings of Honeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, had taught me to view the judicial proceedings of our country with a jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced eye; and, when I was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Algerine mode of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributive juſtice, I yearned to ſee a cauſe
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:032945_0377_0FF5EC5EAC6CAA58"/>
determined in a court, where inſtant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion relieved the anxiety, and ſaved the purſes of the parties; and where no long winded attorney was ſuffered to perplex the judge with ſubtle argument or muſty precedent. I was ſoon delighted with an excellent diſplay of ſummary juſtice. Obſerving a collection of people upon a piazza, I leaned over the rails, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that an Algerine cadi or judge had juſt opened his court. The cadi was ſeated croſs legged on a cuſhion with a ſlave, with a whip and batten on one ſide; and another with a drawn ſcimitar on the other. The plaintiff came forward and told his ſtory. He charged a man, who was in cuſtody, with having ſold him a mule, which he ſaid was ſound, but which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blind and lame. Several witneſſes were then called, who proved the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract and the defects of the mule. The defendant was then called upon for his defence. He did not deny the fact, but
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:032945_0378_0FF5EC9659A932D8"/>
pleaded the law of retaliation. He ſaid, he was a good Muſſulman, performed all the rites of their holy religion, had ſent a proxy to the prophet's tomb at Medina, and maintained an idiot; that he never cheated any man before, but was juſtified in what he had done, for, ten years before, the plaintiff had cheated him worſe in the ſale of a dromedary, which proved broken winded. He proved this by ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral witneſſes, and the plaintiff could not deny it. The judge immediately order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mule and the money paid for it to be produced. He then directed his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants to ſeize the defendant, and give him fifty blows on the ſoles of his feet for this fraud. The plaintiff at every ſtroke applauded the cadi's juſtice to the ſkies; but, no ſooner was the puniſhment inflicted, than, by a nod from the judge, the exulting plaintiff was ſeized and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the ſame number of blows with the batten for the old affair of the broken
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:032945_0379_0FF5EC60CBD73830"/>
winded dromedary. The parties were then diſmiſſed, without coſts, and the judge ordered an officer to take the mule, ſell it at publick outcry, and diſtribute the product, with the money depoſited, in alms to the poor. The officer proceeded a few ſteps with the mule, and, I thought, the court had riſen, when the cadi ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing one of the witneſſes had prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated in his teſtimony called back the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer, who had charge of the mule, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the witneſs to receive twenty five blows of the batten, and be mounted on the back of the mule, with his face to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the tail, and be thus carried through the city, directing the mule to be ſtopped at every corner, where the culprit ſhould exclaim; "before the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened, excellent, juſt, and merciful cadi Mir Karchan, in the trial of Oſman Beker and Abu Iſoul, I ſpoke as I ride." The people around magnified Mir Kar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chan for this exemplary juſtice; and I
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:032945_0380_0FF5EC988D337C70"/>
preſent it to my fellow citizens. If it is generally pleaſing, it may be eaſily intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced among us. Some obſtinate peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may be ſtill attached to our cuſtomary modes of diſpenſing juſtice, and think that the advocates we fee, and the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents they quote, are but guards and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures round our judges, to prevent them from capriciouſly invading the rights of the citizens.</p>

                     <p>I ONCE had an opportunity of approaching unnoticed the window of one of the principal moſques. After the cuſtomary prayers, the prieſt pronounced the following diſcourſe with a dignified elocution. It was received by his audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with a reverence, better becoming chriſtians than infidels. It undoubtedly ſuffers from tranſlation and the fickleneſs of my memory; but the manner, in which it was delivered, and the energy of many of the expreſſions made ſo ſtrong an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that I think I have not material<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:032945_0382_0FF5EC9A1360DC78"/>
varied from the ſentiment. I preſent it to the candid reader, as a curious ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of their pulpit eloquence; and as, perhaps, conveying a more ſatisfactory idea of their creed, than I have already attempted, in the account I have given of their religion. The attributes of Deity were the ſubject of the prieſt's diſcourſe; and, after ſome exordium, he elevated his voice and exclaimed:</p>
                     <p>GOD ALONE IS IMMORTAL. Ibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham and Soliman have ſlept with their fathers, Cadijah the firſt born of faith, Ayiſha the beloved, Omar the meek, Omri the benevolent, the companions of the apoſtle and the Sent of God himſelf, all died. But God moſt high, moſt holy, liveth forever. Infinities are to him, as the numerals of arithmetic to the ſons of Adam; the earth ſhall vaniſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the decrees of his eternal deſtiny; but he liveth and reigneth forever.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="174" facs="unknown:032945_0383_0FF5EC650B9FCCB0"/>
GOD ALONE IS OMNISCIENT. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael, whoſe wings are full of eyes, is blind before him, the dark night is unto him as the rays of the morning; for he noticeth the creeping of the ſmall piſmire in the dark night, upon the black ſtone, and apprehendeth the motion of an atom in the open air.</p>
                     <p>GOD ALONE IS OMNIPRESENT. He toucheth the immenſity of ſpace, as a point. He moveth in the depths of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, and mount Atlas is hidden by the ſole of his foot. He breatheth fragrant odours to cheer the bleſſed in paradiſe, and enliveneth the pallid flame in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundeſt hell.</p>
                     <p>GOD ALONE IS OMNIPOTENT. He thought, and worlds were created; he frowneth, and they diſſolve into thin ſmoke; he ſmileth, and the torments of the damned are ſuſpended. The thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:032945_0384_0FF5EC9C464047E0"/>
of Hermon are the whiſperings of his voice; the ruſtling of his attire cauſeth lightning and an earthquake; and with the ſhadow of his garment he blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth out the ſun.</p>
                     <p>GOD ALONE IS MERCIFUL. When he forged his immutable decrees on the anvil of eternal wiſdom, he tempered the miſeries of the race of Iſmael in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of pity. When he laid the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world he caſt a look of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence into the abyſſes of futurity; and the adamantine pillars of eternal juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice were ſoftened by the beamings of his eyes. He dropt a tear upon the embryo miſeries of unborn man; and that tear, falling through the immeaſurable lapſes of time, ſhall quench the glowing flames of the bottomleſs pit. He ſent his prophet into the world to enlighten the darkneſs of the tribes; and hath prepared the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilions of the Houri for the repoſe of the true believers.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="176" facs="unknown:032945_0385_0FF5EC672AC0DAD0"/>
GOD ALONE IS JUST. He chains the latent cauſe to the diſtant event; and binds them both immutably faſt to the fitneſs of things. He decreed the unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever to wander amidſt the whirlwinds of errour; and ſuited his ſoul to future tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He promulgated the ineffable creed, and the germs of countleſs ſouls of believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which exiſted in the contemplation of Deity, expanded at the ſound. His juſtice refreſheth the faithful, while the damned ſpirits confeſs it in deſpair.</p>
                     <p>GOD ALONE IS ONE. Ibraham the faithful knew it. Moſes declared it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midſt the thunderings of Sinai. Jeſus pronounced; it and the meſſenger of God, the ſword of his vengeance, filled the world with immutable truth.</p>
                     <p>Surely there is one God, IMMORTAL, OMNICIENT, OMNIPRESENT, OMNIPO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TENT, moſt MERCIFUL, and JUST; and Mahomet is his apoſtle.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>I HAVE thus given ſome ſuccinct notices of the hiſtory, government, relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, habits, and manners of this ferocious race. I have interſperſed reflections, which, I hope, will be received by the learned with candour; and ſhall now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the thread of my more appropriate narrative.</p>
                     <p>By unremitted attention to the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of my office and ſome fortunate operations in ſurgery, I had now ſo far ingratiated myſelf with the director and phyſicians of the infirmary, that I was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be abſent any hours of the day, when my buſineſs in the hoſpital permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, without rendering any eſpecial reaſon
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:032945_0388_0FF5ECA122FAA2B8"/>
for my abſence. I wandered into all parts of the city, where ſtrangers were permitted to walk, inſpected every object I could, without giving umbrage. I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtrayed into that quarter of the city, principally inhabited by Jews. This cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning race, ſince their diſperſion by Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſian and Titus, have contrived to compenſate themſelves for the loſs of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine, "by engroſſing the wealth, and ten the luxuries of every other land; and, wearied with the expectation of that heavenly king," who ſhall repoſſeſs them of the holy city, and put their enemies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath their feet, now ſolace themſelves with a Meſſiah, whoſe glory is enſhrined in their coffers. Rigidly attached to their own cuſtoms, intermarrying among themſelves, content to be apparently wretched and deſpiſed, that they may wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in ſecret wealth; and ſecluded, in moſt countries, from holding landed prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, and in almoſt all from filling offic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:032945_0389_0FF5EC6C14CF0AA8"/>
of power and profit, they are gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally received as meet inſtruments to do the mean drudgery of deſpotic courts. The wealth, which would render a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject too powerful, the deſpot can truſt with an unambitious Jew; and confide ſecrets, which involve his own ſafety to a miſerable Iſraelite. whom he can annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with a nod. The Jews tranſact al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt all the Dey's private buſineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that of the negotiations of merchants. Nay, if an envoy from a foreign power comes to treat with the Dey, he may have the parade of a public audience; but, if he wiſhes to accompliſh his embaſſy, he muſt employ a Jew: and, it is ſaid, the Dey himſelf ſhares with the Jew the very ſums paid him for his influence with this politic deſpot. The Jews are alſo the ſpies of the Dey, upon his ſubjects at home, and the channels of intelligence from foreign powers. They are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore allowed to aſſemble in their ſyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues;
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:032945_0390_0FF5ECA2A6FB0CB8"/>
and have frequently an influence at the court of the Dey, with his great officers, and even before the civil judge, not to be accounted for from the morality of their conduct. Popular prejudice is generally againſt them; and the Dey of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten avails himſelf of it by heavy amerce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for his protection. In the year one thouſand ſix hundred and ninety, he threatened to extirpate the whole race in his dominions, and was final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeaſed by a large contribution they raiſed and offered as an expiation of a ſuppoſed offence. It was commonly reported, that the Jews in Algiers, at that time, had procured a chriſtian child, which they privately purified with much ceremony, fattened and prepared for a ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice, at their feaſt of the paſſover, as a ſubſtitute for the paſchal lamb. This horrid tale, which ſhould have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed for its abſurdity and inhumanity, the Dey affected to credit. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:032945_0391_0FF5EC6E36E7DCC8"/>
ſeveral Mahometan prieſts to ſearch the habitations of the Jews, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before the feaſt of the paſſover, who, diſcovering ſome bitter herbs and other cuſtomary preparations for the feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tival, affected to have found ſufficient evidence againſt them; and the mob of Algiers, mad with rage and perhaps in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed by the uſurious exactions of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Jews, ruſhed on furiouſly to pillage and deſtroy the wretched deſcendants of Jacob. Two houſes were demoliſhed, and ſeveral Jews aſſaſſinated before the arrival of the Dey's guards, who quickly diſperſed this outrageous rabble. The Dey, who deſired nothing leſs than the deſtruction of ſo uſeful a people, was ſoon appeaſed by a large preſent, and declared them innocent: and, ſuch is the power of deſpotic governments, that the Jews were ſoon received into general fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; and the very men, who, the day
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:032945_0392_0FF5ECA4C7CE2758"/>

                     </argument>
                     <p>RETURNING from a jaunt into the city, I was immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to retire to my room, and not to quit it, till further orders, which it was impracticable to do, as the doors were faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened upon me. The next morning my proviſions were brought me, and the doors again carefully ſecured. Surpriſed at this impriſonment, I paſſed many reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs hours in recurring to my paſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and perplexing myſelf in ſearching for ſome inadvertent offence, or in dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful apprehenſion, leſt the preſent impriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onment ſhould be a prelude to future and
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:032945_0394_0FF5ECA70CD21AC0"/>
more ſevere puniſhment. The ſtone quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry came to my imagination in all its hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, and the frowns of Abdel Melic again pierced my ſoul. I attempted in vain to obtain from the ſlave, who brought me proviſions, the cauſe of my confinement. He was probably ignorant; my ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were uniformly anſwered by a melancholy ſhake of the head. The next day, the director of the hoſpital ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared. To him I applied with great earneſtneſs; but all the information he would give was, that it was by the Dey's order I was confined; and that he, with the phyſicians and my friend the Mollah were uſing all their influence to obtain my releaſe. He counſelled me to amuſe myſelf in preparing and compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drugs, and promiſed to ſee me again, as ſoon as he could bring any good news. About a week after, an officer of the court, with a city judge, entered my apartment, and informed me of the cauſe of my im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment.
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:032945_0395_0FF5EC7224AFB940"/>
From them I learned, that ſeveral American veſſels had been cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured; and, it was ſuſpected, I had been converſing with my countrymen; and, from my ſuperiour knowledge of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, I might adviſe them how to eſcape. If a man is deſirous to know how he loves his country, let him go far from home; if to know how he loves his countrymen, let him be with them in miſery in a ſtrange land. I wiſh not to make a vain diſplay of my patriotiſm, but I will ſay, that my own miſfortunes, upon this intelligence, were ſo abſorbed in thoſe of my unfortunate fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens, thus delivered over to chains and torment, many of them perhaps ſep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arated from the tendereſt domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions and homes of caſe, that, I thought, I could again have willingly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the laſhes of the ſlave driver, and ſink myſelf beneath the burthens of ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to have ſaved them from an Algerine captivity. I could readily aſſure the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:032945_0396_0FF5ECA9D2D18140"/>
Dey's officers, that I had not converſed with my miſerable countrymen; but, while I ſpake, the idea of embracing a fellow citizen, a brother chriſtian, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome one, who came from the ſame ſtate, or had been in the ſame town, or ſeen my dear parents, paſſed in rapid ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and I was determined, betide what would, to ſeek them the firſt opportunity. We were ſoon joined by the Mollah, who repeatedly aſſured my examiners, that, though an infidel, I might be believed. By his ſolicitation, I was to be releaſed; but not until I would bind myſelf by a ſolemn oath, adminiſtered after the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian manner, that I would never ſpeak to any of the American ſlaves. When this oath was propoſed, I doubted whether to take it; but, recollecting that, if I did not, I ſhould be equally debarred from ſeeing them, and ſuffer a grievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, which could do them no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, I conſented and bound myſelf never
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:032945_0397_0FF5EC74EBD6DAC8"/>
directly or indirectly to attempt to viſit or converſe with my fellow citizens in ſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. It was, at the ſame time, intimat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that for the breach of this oath I might expect to be impaled alive.—Often, when I have drawn near the places of their confinement and labours, I have regretted my ſubmitting to this oath, and once was almoſt tempted to break it, at ſeeing Captain O'Brien at ſome diſtance.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AFTER I had taken this oath, the officers departed, and I was liberated. I was now more cautious in my rambles, avoided the notice of the Muſſulmen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, and made more frequent viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>its to that part of the city, inhabited by Jews and foreigners. Refreſhing myſelf with a glaſs of ſherbet in an inferiour room, I was accoſted by an old man, in mean attire, with a pack of handkerchiefs and ſome remnants of ſilk and muſlins on his back. He aſked me, if I was not the learned ſlave, and requeſted me to viſit a ſick ſon. I immediately reſolved
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:032945_0399_0FF5EC7672451460"/>
to go with him; rejoicing that Providence, in my low eſtate, had left me the power to be charitable. We traverſed ſeveral ſtreets and ſtopped at the door of a houſe, which, in appearance, well ſuited my conductor. It had but two windows towards the ſtreet, and thoſe were cloſed up with rough boards, the cracks of which were ſtuffed with rags and ſtraw. My conductor looked very cautiouſly about, and then, taking a key from his pocket, opened the door. We paſſed a dark en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and, I confeſs, I ſhuddered, as the door cloſed upon me, reflecting that, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, this man was employed to decoy me to ſome ſecret place, in order to aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinate me, by the direction of my ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riours, who might wiſh to deſtroy me in this ſecret manner. But I had but little time for theſe gloomy reflections; for, opening another door, I was ſtartled with a blaze of light, let into apartments ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly furniſhed. My conductor now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:032945_0400_0FF5ECAD952AAF98"/>
an air of importance, requeſted me to repoſe myſelf on a ſilken couch, and retired. A young lady, who was veiled, of a graceful perſon and pleaſing addreſs, ſoon brought a plate of ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meats and a bottle of excellent wine. The old man ſoon reappeared; but, ſo changed in his habit and appearance, I could ſcarce recognize him. He was now arrayed in drawers of the fineſt lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, an embroidered veſt, and looſe gown of the richeſt Perſian ſilk. He ſmiled at my ſurpriſe, ſhook me by the hand, and told me that he was a Jew; aſſuring me, that he was with his brethren under the protection of the Dey. The outward appearance of his houſe, and the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his attire abroad were, he ſaid, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to avoid envy and ſuſpicion. But come, ſaid he, I know all about you; I can confide in you. Come refreſh yourſelf with a glaſs of this wine;—nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moſes nor your Meſſiah forbid the
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:032945_0401_0FF5EC78C5095650"/>
uſe of it. We ate of the collation, drank our wine liberally; and then he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced me to his ſon, whom I found labouring under a violent ague. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered ſome ſudorifics, and left direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the future treatment of my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. Upon my departure, the Jew put a zequin into my hand, and made me promiſe to viſit his ſon again; requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to ſeat myſelf in the place, he had found me, at the ſame hour, the next day but one afterwards; and, in paſſing through the dark entry, conjured me not to mention his domeſtic ſtyle of living. The name of this Jew was Adonah Ben Benjamin. I viſited his ſon, according to appointment, and found him nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to health. The father and ſon both expreſſed great gratitude; but the former told me he would not pay me for this viſit in ſilver or gold, but with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more valuable, by his advice. Come and ſee me ſometimes; I know
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:032945_0402_0FF5ECB02F1A4DC8"/>
this people well, and may render you more ſervice than you expect. I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards viſited this Jew frequently, and from him obtained much information. He told me, in much confidence, that ſoon after I was taken, a Jew and two Algerines made a tour of the United States, and ſent home an accurate account of the American commerce; and that the Dey was ſo impreſſed with the idea of our wealth, that he would never permit the American ſlaves to be ranſomed under a large premium, which muſt be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with the uſual preſents, as a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of peace, and an annual tribute. Expreſſing my anxiety to recover my freedom, he adviſed me to write to ſome of the American agents in Europe. I accordingly addreſſed a letter to William Carmichael, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> charge des affairs from the United States at the court of Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid, repreſenting my deplorable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and the miſerable eſtate of my

fellow priſoners; praying the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of our government, ſtating the probable mode of acceſs to the Dey, and encloſing a letter to my parents. This my friend, the Jew, promiſed to convey; but, as I never received any anſwer from Mr. Carmichael, and my letters never found the way to my friends, I conclude, from the known humanity of that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, my letters miſcarried.</p>
                     <p>Some time after, I heard that the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States had made application, through Mr. I amb, for the redemption of their citizens, and I had hopes of liberty; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending, if that gentleman ſucceeded in his negotiations, to claim my right to be ranſomed, as an American citizen, but his propoſals were ſcouted with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. I have ſometimes heard this gentleman cenſured for failing to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh the object of his miſſion, but very unjuſtly; as I well remember that I, who was much intereſted in his ſucceſs, never
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:032945_0404_0FF5ECB25FAA6260"/>
blamed him at the time; and, I know, the ranſom, he offered the Dey, was rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iculed in the common coffee houſes, as extremely pitiful. The few Algerines, I converſed with, affected to repreſent it as inſulting. It was reported, that he was empowered to offer only two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dollars per head for each priſoner indiſcriminately, when the common price was four thouſand dollars per head for a captain of a veſſel, and one thouſand four hundred for a common fore maſt ſailor. When this unſucceſsful attempt failed, the priſoners were treated with greater ſeverity; doubtleſs with a deſign to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright the Americans into terms, more advantageous to the Dey.</p>
                     <p>Finding my hopes of releaſe from the applications of my country to fade, I conſulted the friendly Jew, who adviſed me to endeavour to pay my own ranſom, which, he ſaid, might be effected with my ſavings from my practice by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:032945_0405_0FF5EC7DBB1A5348"/>
of a rich Jew, his relation. I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly put all my ſavings into Adonah Ben Benjamin's hands, which amounted to two hundred and eighty dollars, and reſolved to add to it all I could procure. To this intent I hoarded up all I could obtain; denying myſelf the ſlender re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments of bathing and cooling liq<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uors, to which I had been for ſome time accuſtomed. The benevolent Hebrew promiſing that, when I had attained the ſum requiſite, within two or three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred dollars, he himſelf would advance the remainder, no miſer was ever more engaged than I to increaſe my ſtore. After a tedious interval, my proſpects brightened ſurpriſingly. Some fortunate operations, I performed, obtained me valuable preſents; one to the amount of fifty dollars. My ſtock, in the Jew's hands, had increaſed to nine hundred dollars; and, to add to my good fortune, the Jew told me, in great confidence, that,
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:032945_0406_0FF5ECB3E3AC4360"/>
from the pleaſing account of the United States, which I had given him, for I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſpake of the privileges of my native land with fervour, he was determined to remove with his family thither. He ſaid he would make up the deficiency in my ranſom, and ſend me home by the firſt European veſſel, with letters to a Mr. Lopez, a Jew, who, he ſaid, lived in Rhode Iſland or Maſſachuſetts, to whom he had a recommendation from a relation, who had been in America. To Mr. Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pez he intended to conſign his property. He accordingly procured his friend, whoſe name I did not then learn, to agree about my ranſom. He concluded the contract at two thouſand dollars. My friends in the hoſpital expreſſed ſorrow at parting with me; and making me ſome pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry preſents, I immediately added them to my ſtock, in the hands of the Jew. In order to leſſen the price of my ranſom, the contractor had told my maſter that
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:032945_0407_0FF5EC7FF2590DA8"/>
he was to advance the money, and take my word to remit it, upon my return to my friends. This ſtory I confirmed. I went to the Jew's houſe, who honeſtly produced all my ſavings; we counted them together, and he added the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, tying the money up in two large bags, We ſpent a happy hour, over a bottle of his beſt wine: I, in anticipating the pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure my parents and friends, would receive in recovering their ſon, who was loſt, and the Jew in framing plans of commerce in the United States, and in the enjoyment of his riches in a country, where no deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pot ſhould force from him his honeſt gains; and, what added to my enjoyment, was the information that a veſſel was to ſail for Gibraitar in two days, in which, he aſſured me, he would procure me a paſſage. I returned to the hoſpital, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting in my happy proſpects. I was quite beſide myſelf with joy. I capered and danced as merrily, as my youthful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:032945_0408_0FF5ECB5F97AD030"/>
at a huſking. Sometimes I would be loſt in thought, and then burſt ſuddenly into loud laughter. The next day towards evening, I haſted to the houſe of my friend the Jew, to ſee if he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged my paſſage, and to gratify myſelf with converſing upon my native land. Being intimate in the family, I was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with a key of the front door. I opened it haſtily, and paſſing the entry, knocked for admittance at the inner door, which was ſoon opened. But, inſtead of the accuſtomed ſplendour, all was gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; the windows darkened, and the fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily in tears. Poor Adonah Ben Benja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min had, that morning, been ſtruck with an apoplexy, and ſlept with his fathers. I ſoon retired as ſincere a mourner as the neareſt kindred. I had indeed more rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to mourn than I conceived; for, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on applying to his ſon for his aſſiſtance in perfecting my freedom, which his good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had ſo happily begun, he profeſſed
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:032945_0409_0FF5ECDEEAFA3280"/>
the utmoſt ignorance of the whole tranf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action; declared that he did not know the name of the agent, his father had employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and gave no credit to my account of the monies I had lodged with his father. I deſcribed the bags. He cooly anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the God of his father Abraham had bleſſed his father Adonah with many ſuch bags. I left him, diſtracted with my diſappointment. Sometimes I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to relate the whole ſtory to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rector of the hoſpital, and apply for legal redreſs to a cadi; but the ſpecimen I had of an Algerine law ſuit deterred me. I had been ſo inadvertent, as to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance the ſtory that a Jew was to advance the whole ſum for me. If I had been a Muſſulman, I might have atteſted to my ſtory; but a ſlave is never admitted as an evidence in Algiers, the Weſt Indies, or the Southern States. The diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my hopes were ſoon known in the hoſpital, though the hand Adonah
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:032945_0410_0FF5ECDB30DDA4C0"/>
Ben Benjamin had in the contract re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a ſecret. The artful Jew, who had contracted for my ranſom, fearing he ſhould have to advance the money him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſpread a report that I was immenſely rich in my own country. This coming to the ears of my maſter, he raiſed my ranſom to ſix thouſand dollars, which the wily Iſraelite declining to pay, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract was diſſolved. From my maſter I learned his name, and waited upon him, hoping to obtain ſome evidence of Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah's having received my money, at leaſt ſo far as to induce his ſon to reſtore it. But the Jew poſitively declared that Adonah never told him other, than that he was to advance the caſh himſelf. Thus, from the brighteſt hopes of freedom, I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to deſpair; my money loſt; and my ranſom raiſed. I bleſs a merciful God that I was preſerved from the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate folly of ſuicide. I never attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my life; but, when I lay down, I oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:032945_0411_0FF5ECE0F5BAF1A0"/>
hoped that I might never awake again, in this world of miſery. I grew dejected and my fleſh waſted. The phyſicians recommended a journey into the country, which my maſter approved; for, ſince the report of my wealth in my native land, he viewed my life as valuable to him, as he doubted not my friends would one day ranſom me at an exorbitant premium.</p>

                        <p>The Author, by Permiſſion of his Maſter, travels to Medina, the burial Place of the Prophet Mahomet.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>THE director ſoon after pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that I ſhould attend ſome mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, as a ſurgeon in a voyage and journey to Medina, the burial, and Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca the birth, place of the prophet Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet; aſſuring me, that I ſhould be treated with reſpect, and indeed find ſome agreeable companions on the tour, as ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral of the merchants were infidels, like myſelf, and that any monies I might ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, by itinerant practice, ſhould be my own. I accepted this propoſal with pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure,
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:032945_0413_0FF5ECE3CB30B348"/>
and was ſoon leaſed to two Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man merchants, who gave a kind of bond for my ſafe return to my maſter. I had caſh advanced me to purchaſe medicines, and a caſe of ſurgeon's inſtruments, which I was directed to ſlow in a large leather wallet. I took a kind leave of my pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons in the hoſpital, who beſtowed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little preſents of ſweetmeats, dates, and oranges. I waited upon the good Mollah, who preſented me with fifty dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. I have charity to believe that this man, though an apoſtate, was ſincere in his faith in the Mahometan creed. He preſſed my hand at parting, gave me ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſalutary cautions, as to my conduct during the voyage; and ſaid, while the tears ſtarted in his eyes, my friend, you have ſuffered much misfortune and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery in a ſhort life; let me conjure you not to add the torments of the future to the miſeries of the preſent world. But, added he, pauſing, who ſhall alter the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:032945_0414_0FF5C42B67BF3F48"/>
of God? I flatter myſelf, that the ſcales of natal prejudice will yet fall from your eyes, and that your name was numbered among the faithful from all eternity.</p>
                     <p>Our company conſiſted of two Alge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine merchants, or factors, twenty pilgrims, nine Jews, among whom was the ſon of my deceaſed friend Adonah, and two Greek traders from Chios, who carried with them ſeveral bales of ſilks and a quantity of maſtic, to vend at Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon, Grand Cairo and Medina. We took paſſage in a Xebec; and, coaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the African ſhore, ſoon paſſed the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ins of antient Carthage, the Bay of Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis; and, weathering cape Bona, and ſteering ſouth eaſterly, one morning hove in ſight of the Iſland of Malta, inhabited by the knights of that name, who are ſworn enemies of the Mahometan faith. I could perceive, that the ſight of this iſland gave a ſenſible alarm to the crew
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:032945_0415_0FF5ECE5E0AE1E90"/>
and paſſengers. But the captain, or rather ſkipper, who was a bluſtering, rough renegado, affected great courage and ſwore that, if he had but one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non on board, he would run down and give a broad ſide to the infidel dogs. His bravery was ſoon put to the teſt; for, as the ſun aroſe, we could diſcern plainly an armed veſſel bearing down upon us. She overhauled us faſt, and our ſkipper conjectured ſhe bore the Malteſe colours. All hands were now ſummoned to get out ſome light ſails, and ſeveral oars were put out, at which the brave ſkipper tugged as luſtily as the meaneſt of us. When the wind lulled and we gained of the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he would run upon the quarters of the Xebec, and hollow; "Come on, you chriſtian dogs, I am ready for you," I have ſome doubts, whether the veſſel ever noticed us. If ſhe did, ſhe deſpiſed us; for ſhe tacked and ſtood to the ſouth weſt. This was no ſooner perceived by
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:032945_0416_0FF5ECB8D21E4288"/>
our gallant commander, than he ordered the Xebec to lay too, and ſwore, that he would purſue the uncircumciſed dogs, and board them; but he firſt would pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently aſk the approbation of the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, who inſtantly determined one and all that their buſineſs was ſuch, that they muſt inſiſt upon the captain's making his beſt way to port. The captain conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but not without much grumbling at his misfortune, in loſing ſo fine a prize; and declared that, when he landed his paſſengers, he would directly quit the port and renew the chaſe. After a ſmart run, we dropt anchor in the port of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, called by the Turks Scandaroon. This is the ſite of the antient Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>andria, founded by Alexander the great; though its preſent appearance would not induce an opinion of ſo magnificent a founder. It lies not far from the weſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt branch of the river Nile, by which, in ancient day, it was ſupplied with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:032945_0417_0FF5ECE766108D78"/>
The antiquarian eye may poſſibly obſerve, in the ſcattered fragments of rocks, the veſtiges of the ruins of its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient grandeur; but a vulgar traveller, from the appearance of the harbour, chok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſand, the miſerable buildings, and more wretched inhabitants of the town, would not be led to conclude that this was the port, which roſe triumphant on the ruins of Tyre and Carthage. We here hired camels; and, being joined by a number of pilgrims and traders, collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from various parts of the Levant, we proceeded towards Grand Cairo, the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent capital of Egypt; and, after travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling three days, or rather three nights, for we generally repoſed in the heat of the day, which is ſevere from one hour after the ſun's riſing until it ſets, we came to a pretty town on the weſt bank of the Nile, called Gize, and hence paſſed over on rafts to the city of Grand Cairo, called by the Turks Almizer; the ſuburbs of which
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:032945_0418_0FF5ECBAE7C97C60"/>
extend to the river, but the principal town commences its proper boundaries, at about three miles eaſt of the Nile. I was now within a comparatively ſhort diſtance of two magnificent curioſities, I had ever been deſirous of beholding. The city of Jeruſalem was only about five day's journey to the ſouth eaſt, and I had even caught a glimpſe of the pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mids near Gize. I went with my maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and others to ſee a deep ſtoned pit, in the caſtle, called Joſeph's well; and ſaid to have been dug by the direction of that patriarch. I am not antiquarian enough to know the particular ſtyle of Joſeph's well archite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture; but the water was ſweet and extremely cold. The Turks ſay that Potiphar's wife did not ceaſe to perſecute Joſeph with her love, after he was releaſed from priſon, and advanced to power; but the patriarch, being warned by a dream to dig this well, and invite her to drink of the water, which ſhe had no
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:032945_0419_0FF5ECE8EABAFED0"/>
ſooner done, but one cup of it ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally cooled her deſires, that ſhe was ever afterwards an eminent example of the moſt frigid chaſtity. In Grand Cairo, we were joined by many pilgrims from Paleſtine, and the adjacent countries. The third day, our carivan, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of three hundred camels and drom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edaries, ſet out for Medina, under the convoy of a troop of Mamaleuk's guards, a tawny, raw boned, ill clothed people. Some of the merchants, and even pilgrims made a handſome appearance in perſon, dreſs, and equipage. I was myſelf well mounted upon a camel, and carried with me only my leather wallet of drugs, which I diſpenſed freely among the pilgrims; my maſters receiving the ordinary pay, while I collected many ſmall ſums, which the gratitude of my patients added to the uſual fee. We paſſed near the north arm of the red ſea, and then purſued our journey ſouth, until we ſtruck the ſame
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:032945_0420_0FF5ECBC6DB4D9F8"/>
arm again, near the place where the learned Wortley Montague has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the Iſraelites, under the conduct of Moſes, effected their paſſage. The breadth of the ſea here is great, and the waters deep and turbulent. The infidel may ſneer, if he chooſes; but, for my own part, I am convinced beyond a doubt, that, if the Iſraelites paſſed in this place, it muſt have been by the miraculous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſition of a divine power. I could not refrain from reflecting upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated temerity, which impelled the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gygtian king to follow them. Well does the Latin poet exclaim; <hi>Quem Deus vult perdere, prius dementat.</hi> We then travelled eaſt, until we came to a ſmall village, called Tadah. Here we filled many goat ſkins with water, and laded our camels with them. In addition to my wallet, I received two goat ſkins or bags of water upon my camel. The weight, this uſeful animal will carry, is
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:032945_0421_0FF5ECEBA9CE54E0"/>
aſtoniſhing; and the facility and promp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, with which he kneels to receive his rider and burthen, ſurpriſing. We now entered the confines of Arabia Petrea, very aptly denominated the rocky Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia; for, journeying ſouth eaſt, we paſſed over many ridges of mountains, which appeared of ſolid rocks, while the vallies and plains between them were almoſt a quickſand. Not a tree, ſhrub, or vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is to be ſeen. In theſe vallies, the ſun poured intolerable day, and its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections from the land were inſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. No refreſhing breeze is here felt. The intelligent traveller often fears the riſing of the wind, which blows ſuch ſultry gales, that man and beaſt oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſink beneath them, "never to riſe again" or, when agitated into a tempeſt drive the ſand with ſuch tumultuous vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as to overwhelm whole caravans. Such indeed were the ſtories told me, as I paſſed theſe dreary plains. The only
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:032945_0422_0FF5ECBE8A9EE328"/>
inconvenience, I ſuſtained, aroſe from the intenſe heat of the ſun, and the chills of the night, which our thin garments were not calculated to exclude. On the third day, after we left Tadah, the water, which we tranſported on our camels, was nearly expended. Theſe extraordinary animals had not drank but once, ſince our departure. Near the middle of the fourth day, I obſerved our camels ſnuff the air, and ſoon ſet off in a briſk trot, and juſt before night brought us to wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This was contained in only one deep well, dug, like a reverſed pyramid, with ſteps, to deſcend on every ſide, to the depth of one hundred feet; yet the ſagacity of the camel had diſcovered this water at perhaps twenty miles diſtance. So my fellow travellers aſſerted; but I have ſince thought, whether theſe camels, from frequently paſſing this deſert coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, did not diſcover their approach to water, rather from the eye, noting familiar
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:032945_0423_0FF5ECEE546F3380"/>
objects, than the actual ſcenting the water itſelf. A horſe that has journeyed the whole day, will quicken his ſtep at night, when, upon a familiar road, within ſome miles of an accuſtomed ſtable. Our eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cort delighted in the marvellous. Many a dreadful ſtory did they tell of poiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onous winds and overwhelming ſands; and of the fierce wandering Arabs, who captured whole caravans, and eat their priſoners. Many a bloody battle had they fought with this cruel banditti, in which, according to their narratives, they always came off conquerours. Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently were we alarmed, to be in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ineſs to combat their ſavage free booters; though I never ſaw but two of the wild Arabs, in the whole of our journey. They joined us at a little village, eaſt of Iſlamboul, and accoſted us with great ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility. They were dreſſed in blue frocks, girded round the waſte with particolour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſaſhes, in which were ſtuck a piſtol
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:032945_0424_0FF5ECC1548D3718"/>
and a long knife. Their legs were bare, and ſheepſkin caps covered their heads. Their complexions were ſallow, but their garments and perſons were clean. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, their dreſs and addreſs evinced them to be of a more civilized race than our guards, who affected to treat them with lofty hauteur; and, when they departed, aſſured us that they were ſpies, and that an attack from their countrymen might now be apprehended with certainly; if, ſaid the leader of our eſcort, they are not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified by finding you under our protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>WHEN we were within one day's journey of Medina, we halted for a longer time than uſual; occaſioned, as I found, by the arrival of a moſt holy ſaint. As I had never ſeen a ſaint, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bred, in a land, where even the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics of theſe holy men are not preſerved, for I believe all New England cannot produce ſo much as a ſaint's rotten tooth or toe nail, I was ſolicitous to ſee and converſe with this bleſſed perſonage. I ſoon diſcovered him, in the midſt of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fifty pilgrims, ſome of whom were devoutly touching their foreheads with
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:032945_0426_0FF5ECC2D9602F70"/>
the hem of his garment, while others, ſtill more devout, proſtrated themſelves on the ground, and kiſſed the prints of his footſteps in the ſand. Though I was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured, that he was filled with divine love, and conferred felicity on all, who touched him; yet, to outward appearance, he was the moſt diſguſting, contemptible object, I had ever ſeen. Figure to yourſelves, my readers, a little decrepit, old man, made ſhorter by ſtooping, with a counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, which exhibited a vacant ſtare, his head bald, his finger and toe nails as long as hawks' claws, his attire ſqualid, his face, neck, arms, and legs begrimed with dirt and ſwarming with vermin, and you will have ſome faint idea of this Muſſulman ſaint. As I was too reaſonable to expect that holineſs exiſted in a man's exteriour, I waited to hear him ſpeak; anticipating, from his lips, the profoundeſt wiſdom, delivered in the honied accents of the ſaints in bliſs. At length he ſpake; and
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:032945_0427_0FF5ECF1FA696268"/>
his ſpeech betrayed him, a mere idiot. While this aſtoniſhed me, it raiſed the reſpect of his admirers, who eſtimated his ſanctity in an inverſe ratio to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his intellects. If they could have aſcertained, that he was born an idiot, I verily believe, they would have adored him; for the Mahometans are taught by their alcoran, that the ſouls of ſaints are often lodged in the bodies of idiots; and theſe pious ſouls, being ſo intent on the joys of paradiſe, is the true reaſon, that the actions of their bodies are ſo little ſuited to the manners of this world. This ſaint however did not aſpire to the ſanctity of a genuine idiot; though, I fancy, his modeſty injured his prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for he certainly had very fair pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions. It was reſolved, that the holy man ſhould go with us; and, to my great mortification and diſguſt, he was mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed behind me on the ſame camel; my Mahometan friends probably conceiving,
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:032945_0428_0FF5ECC50EABA550"/>
that he would ſo far communicate his ſanctity by contact, as that it might affect my converſion to their faith. Whatever were their motives, in the embraces of this nausſeous being, with the people proſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in reverence on each ſide, I made my entry into the city of Medina.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>MEDINA Tadlardh, errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly called Medina Talmabi, is ſituated in Arabia Deſerta, about forty five miles eaſt from the borders of the red ſea. To this place, as has been before related, the prophet ſled, when driven from Mecca his birth place; and here he was buried, and his remains ſtill are preſerved, in a ſilver cuſſin, ornamented with a golden creſcent, enriched with jewels, covered with cloth of gold, ſupported upon ſilver taſſels, and ſhadowed by a canopy, embroidered with
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:032945_0430_0FF5ECC740DF82C0"/>
ſilk and gold thread upon ſilver tiſſue. This canopy is renewed annually, by the baſhaw of Egypt; though other baſhaws, and great men among the Turks, often aſſiſt in the expenſe, or augment the value of the yearly preſent, by ſilver lamps and other ornaments. The whole are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in a magnificent moſque, in which are ſuſpended innumerable gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lamps, ſome of which are kept contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually burning, and all are lighted on cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain public occaſions; and even upon the approach of ſome dignified pilgrim. I had not acquired ſufficient holineſs, from my bleſſed companion, to be permitted to enter this ſanctified building. The Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bians are profuſely extravagant, in the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles they beſtow on the city of Medina; calling it the moſt holy, moſt renowned, moſt excellent city; the ſanctuary of the bleſſed fugitive; model of the refulgent city in the celeſtial paradiſe; and ſome of the great vulgar ſuppoſe, that when
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:032945_0431_0FF5ECF6D23D4408"/>
the world ſhall be deſtroyed, this city, with the prophet's remains, will be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by angels, with all its inhabitants, to paradiſe. We tarried there but a few hours, as the great object of the devotions of the pilgrims was Mecca. Pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages are performed to both places; but thoſe to Medina are not indiſpenſably neceſſary; being directed by the book of the companions of the apoſtles, while thoſe to Mecca are enjoined by the alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran itſelf. The former are ſuppoſed meritorious, the latter neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I had the curioſity to inquire re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the prophet's coſſin being ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in the air by a load ſtone, and was aſſured that this was a mere chriſtian obloquy, as no pretenſions of any ſuch ſuſpenſion were ever made.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>BEING freed from my bleſſed companion, I had an agreeable journey from Medina to Mecca, which is the moſt antient city in all Arabia; ſituated about two hundred miles ſouth eaſt of Medina, twenty one degrees and forty five minutes north latitude, and one hundred and ſixteen degrees eaſt longitude, from Philadelphia, according to late American calculations. I ſaw the great moſque in the centre of Mec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, which it is ſaid, far ſurpaſſes in grandeur that of Sancta Sophia in Conſtantinople. It certainly is a very auguſt building, the roof of which is refulgent; but even the
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:032945_0433_0FF5ECF85C5BC018"/>
inhabitants ſmiled at my credulity, when I obſerved that I had read it was covered with plated gold. This moſque contains within its limits the grand object of the Muſſulman's pilgrimage; the <hi>Al Kaaba,</hi> or houſe of God, ſaid to have been built by the hands of the patriarch Abraham; to confirm which the Arabian prieſts ſhew a black ſtone, upon which they ſay Abraham laid his ſon Iſaac, when he had bound him in preparation for his intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſacrifice. This ſtone and building were great objects of veneration, before the miſſion of the prophet, and he artfully availed himſelf of this popular prejudice, in rendering the higheſt reſpect to the holy houſe, in his life time, and enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon his followers, without diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among males, to viſit it once in their lives. The advent of the prophet was ſaid to be announced from the four cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the houſe, which exhibit the four cardinal points. Few pilgrims are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:032945_0434_0FF5ECCC3A9350C8"/>
to enter this ſacred, venerable building; but, after travelling, ſome of them perhaps a thouſand miles, they are content to proſtrate themſelves in the courts, which ſurround it. Few Mahom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etans perform this pilgrimage in perſon; thoſe who do are highly reſpected. This pilgrimage was enjoined, by the prophet, to be performed in perſon; but, when he laid this injunction, it is not probable he anticipated the extenſive ſpread of his doctrines. So long as his diſciples were limited by the boundaries of Arabia, or had only extended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves over a part of Syria, this pious journey was practicable and eaſy; but, when the creſcent roſe triumphant on the ſea coaſt, and moſt of the interiour of Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, when it ſhone with ſplendour in Perſia, Tartary, and Turkey, and even adorned the Mooriſh minarit in Spain, actual pilgrimage was deemed impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the faithful were allowed to
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:032945_0435_0FF5ECF9E25448C8"/>
viſit the Kaaba by deputy. The inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity of more modern times has alleviated this religious burthen ſtill further, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the deputy to ſubſtitute other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tornies under him. Thus for example: the pious Muſſulman in Belgrade will employ a friend at Conſtantinople, who will empower another friend at Scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roon to procure a confidential friend at Grand Cairo to go in the name of him at Belgrade, and perform his pilgrimage to Mecca. Certificates of theſe ſeveral ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions are preſerved, and the lazy Muſſulman hopes by this fineſſe to reap the rewards of the faithful in paradiſe.</p>

                     </argument>
                     <p>AFTER tarrying ſixteen days at Mecca, during which time my maſters faſted, prayed, performed their devotions at the Kaaba, and ſold their merchandize, we retraced the ſame rout to Scandaroon. Here we found the ſon of Adonah Ben Benjamin, who had been detained in this place by ſickneſs, ſo weakened from a tedious ſlow fever that his life was deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of. He expreſſed great joy, at our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:032945_0437_0FF5ECFD2B88A740"/>
and begged my profeſſional aſſiſtance; aſſuring me, that he eſteemed his preſent diſorder a judicial puniſhment from the God of his fathers, for the injury he had done me; candidly confeſſing, that he knew of his father's having received my money, which he would reſtore upon our return to Algiers, if I would effect his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery. He prevailed upon my maſters that I ſhould abide in the houſe with him, during their abſence, as they were engaged upon a trading tour to a place called Ginge, upon the river Nile. I exerted all my ſkill, both as a phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian and nurſe. Perhaps my atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the latter capacity, aſſiſted by his youth, was of more ſervice than my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions. Be that as it may, he recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered rapidly, and in ten days was able to walk the ſtreets; but I could not help noticing with ſorrow, that as his ſtrength increaſed, his gratitude and promiſes to refund my money decreaſed.</p>

                        <p>The Gratitude of a Jew.</p>
                     </argument>
                     <p>ONE day, walking on the beach, the Jew looked me ſteadily in the face; and, laying his hand upon my ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ſaid I owe you my life, I owe you money, which you cannot oblige me to pay. You think, a Jew will always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in money matters. You are miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en. You ſhall not wait for your pay in Algiers; I will pay you here in Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria. I owe you one thouſand dollars on my father's account. Now, what do you demand for reſtoring me to health? Nothing replied I, overjoyed at his prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; reſtore me my money, and you are welcome to my ſervices. This muſt not
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:032945_0439_0FF5ECFF55843978"/>
be, ſaid the ſon of Adonah, I have done wickedly, but mean not only to pay you, but ſatiſfy my own conſcience. I will allow you in addition to the one thouſand dollars, two thouſand more for your aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, as a phyſician; and then will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance three thouſand more, which I will take your word to repay me, when you are able. I was aſtoniſhed. I ſeized his hand and felt his pulſe, to diſcover if he was not delirious. His pulſe were regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and I knew his ability to perform his promiſe. We will meet here on the morrow, and I will pay you. I met him the next day, and he was not ready to make payment. I now began to doubt his promiſes, and blame myſelf for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of hope. By his appointment I met him the third day, on a retired part of the beach, weſtward from the port. We now ſaw a man approaching us. That man, ſaid the Jew, will pay you. You well underſtand, my friend, that your
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:032945_0440_0FF5ECD2D94C6CD8"/>
ranſom is fixed at ſix thouſand dollars. Now, whoever gives you your liberty, really pays you that ſum. I have engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the perſon, who is approaching, and who is the maſter of a ſmall veſſel, to tranſport you to Gibraltar, whence you may find your way home. The man now joined us and confirmed the words of the Jew, for whom he profeſſed a great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. It was concluded, that I ſhould come to that ſpot immediately after dark, where I ſhould find a ſmall boat waiting to carry me on board the veſſel. The maſter of the veſſel declaring, that he run a great riſk, in aſſiſting in my eſcape; but was willing to do it out of commiſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for me, and friendſhip for the Jew; and reminded me, that I had better pack up all my property, and bring it with me. I haſtened home with the Jew, and collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the property I could with propriety call my own; which conſiſted of a few clothes, and to the amount of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:032945_0441_0FF5ED00D9AE0538"/>
and twenty dollars in caſh. As ſoon as it was dark, the Jew accompanied me to the beach, and then took an affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate leave of me, preſenting me with the value of ten dollars, as a loan, gravely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking, that now I owed him three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and ten dollars, which he hoped I would tranſport to him as ſoon as I arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in America. The Jew quitted me, and I ſoon diſcovered the approach of the boat, which I ſlept into with a light heart, congratulating myſelf, that I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain A FREE MAN. The boat ſoon row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along ſide of a veſſel, that was laying to for us. I jumped on board, and was directly ſeized by two men, who bound me and hurried me below deck; and, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter robbing me of all my property, left me in the dark to my own reflections. I had been ſo long the ſport of cruel fortune, that theſe were not ſo ſevere, as my ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathiſing readers may conjecture. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated miſfortunes blunt ſenſibility. I
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:032945_0442_0FF5ECD4F114E930"/>
perceived that I had been played a vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanous trick, and exchanged a tolerable ſlavery, for one perhaps more inſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but ſhould have been perfectly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to my fate, if the dread of being returned to Algiers and ſuffering the dreadful puniſhment, already related, had not preſented itſelf. In the morning, I requeſted to ſee the captain; and, by his orders, was brought upon deck; to my ſurpriſe, it was not the ſame perſon who had decoyed me on board. I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. I intended to have expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated; but could I tell a ſtranger, a man, who appeared a Muſſulman by his garb, that I was a runaway ſlave? While I was perplexing myſelf what to ſay, the man, who had decoyed me on board, appeared. He was a paſſenger, and claimed me as his ſlave, having purchaſed me, as he ſaid, for four hundred zequins of a Jew, my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer maſter, and meant to carry me with him to Tunis. I was now awakened to
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:032945_0443_0FF5ED02601A98F0"/>
all the horrours of my ſituation. I dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not irritate my new maſter by contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and acquieſced in his ſtory in dumb deſpair. On the eighth day, after we departed from Scandaroon, the veſſel made cape Bona, and expected ſoon to anchor in the port of Tunis. My maſter had a Portugueſe ſlave on board, who ſlept in the birth with me. He ſpoke a little broken Engliſh, having been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a ſailor on board a veſſel of that nation. He gave me the moſt alarming apprehenſions of the cruelty of our maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but flattered me by ſaying that the Tuniſe in general were more mild with their ſlaves than the Algerines, and allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a freer intercourſe with the European merchants; and, by their interference, we might obtain our liberty. While my fellow ſlave ſlept, I lay agonizing with the dread of entering the port of Tunis. Often did I wiſh that ſome friendly rock or kindly leak would ſink me, and my
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:032945_0444_0FF5ECD674E30448"/>
miſfortunes, in perpetual oblivion; and I was nigh being gratified in my deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate wiſhes; for, the ſame night, a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous ſtorm aroſe, and the gale ſtruck us with ſuch violence, that our ſails were inſtantly flittered into rags. We could not ſhew a yard of canvaſs, and were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to ſcud under bare poles. The night was exceſſively dark; and, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe our diſtreſs, our ballaſt ſhifted and we were obliged to cut away our maſts by the board, to ſave us from foundering. The veſſel righted, but being ſtrong and light, and the hatchways being well ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, our captain was only fearful of being driven on ſome chriſtian coaſt. The next night, the wind lulled; and the morning after, the ſun aroſe clear, and we found ourſelves off the coaſt of Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinia, and within gun ſhot of an armed veſſel. She proved to be a Portugueſe frigate. To the confuſion and diſmay of our captain and paſſenger, and to the great
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:032945_0445_0FF5ED05183816A8"/>
joy of myſelf and fellow ſlave. The frig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate hoiſted her colours, manned her boats, and boarded us. No ſooner was his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional flag diſplayed, than the overjoyed Portugueſe ran below and liberated me from my fetters, hugged me in raptures, and hauling me upon deck, the firſt man we met was our maſter, whom he ſaluted with a kick, and then ſpit in his face. I muſt confeſs that this reverſe of fortune made me feel for the wretched Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who ſtood quivering with apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of inſtant death; nor could I refrain from preventing the Portugueſe from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging himſelf for the cruelties, he had ſuffered, under this barbarian. The boats ſoon boarded us, and ſecured the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and crew, whom they treated with as much bitter contempt, as my fellow had exerciſed toward our late maſter. This poor fellow ſoon introduced me to his countrymen, with a brief account of my country and miſfortunes.</p>

                     <p>THE Portugueſe officers treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with politeneſs; and, when they were rifling the veſſel, requeſted me to ſelect my property from the plunder. I was then ſent on board the frigate. The captain expreſſed much joy, at being the means of my deliverance, and told me, that the Portugueſe had a ſincere regard for the Americans; and that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived expreſs orders to protect our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce from the Barbary corſairs. The priſoners were brought on board and confined below; and, after every thing valuable was taken from the prize, the ſhip ſtood for the ſtraits of Gibraltar,
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:032945_0447_0FF5ED07C6DF23D8"/>
leaving a boat to fire the Tuniſe veſſel. I never received more civility than from the officers of this frigate. In compliment to them, I was obliged to throw my Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan dreſs over the ſhip's ſide; for they furniſhed me with every neceſſary, and many ornamental articles of Europe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an clothing. The ſurgeon was particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly attentive. I lent him ſome aſſiſtance among the ſick, his mate being unwell; and, among other preſents, he gave me a handſome pocket caſe of ſurgical inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. After a pleaſant voyage, we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored in port Logos, in the ſouthern extremity of Portugal. Here I received the agreeable intelligence, that the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States were about commencing a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the Dey of Algiers, by the agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of Joſeph Donaldſon, jun. <abbr>Esq</abbr> which would liberate my unhappy fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and ſecure the American commerce from future depredations. Without landing, I had the good fortune to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:032945_0448_0FF5C41FD64A5C20"/>
a paſſage on board an Engliſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantman, bound for Briſtol, Captain Joſeph, Joceline, commander. We had a proſperous voyage to the land's end; and, very fortunately for me, juſt off the little iſle of Lundy, ſpake with a brigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, bound to Cheſapeak Bay, Captain John Harris, commander. In thirty two days, we made Cape Charles, the north chop of the Cheſapeak, and I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon the captain to ſet me on ſhore; and, on the third day of May, one thouſand ſeven hundred and ninety five, I landed in my native country, after an abſence of ſeven years and one month; about ſix years of which I had been a ſlave. I purchaſed a horſe, and haſtened home to my parents, who received me as one riſen from the dead. I ſhall not attempt to deſcribe their emotions, or my own raptures. I had ſuffered hunger, ſickneſs, fatigue, inſult, ſtripes, wounds, and every other cruel injury; and was
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:032945_0449_0FF5ED094C547A98"/>
now under the roof of the kindeſt and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt of parents. I had been degraded to a ſlave, and was now advanced to a citizen of the freeſt country in the univerſe. I had been loſt to my parents, friends, and country; and now found, in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces and congratulations of the former, and the rights and protection of the latter, a rich compenſation for all paſt miſeries. From ſome minutes I preſerved, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled theſe memoirs; and, by the ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of ſome reſpectable friends, have been induced to ſubmit them to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. A long diſuſe of my native tongue, will apologize to the learned reader for any inaccuracies.</p>
                     <p>I now mean to unite myſelf to ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miable woman, to purſue my practice, as a phyſician; which, I hope, will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with more ſucceſs than when eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed with the inexperience and giddi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of youth. To contribute cheerfully to the ſupport of our excellent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:032945_0450_0FF5ECDD667922E8"/>
which I have learnt to adore, in ſchools of deſpotiſm; and thus ſecure to myſelf the enviable character of an uſeful phyſician, a good father and worthy FEDERAL citizen.</p>
                     <p>My ardent wiſh is, that my fellow cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izens may profit by my miſfortunes. If they peruſe theſe pages with attention they will perceive the neceſſity of uniting our federal ſtrength to inforce a due reſpect among other nations. Let us, one and all, endeavour to ſuſtain the general gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. Let no foreign emiſſaries in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame us againſt one nation, by raking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the aſhes of long extinguiſhed enmity or delude us into the extravagant ſchemes of another, by recurring to fancied grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. Our firſt object is union among ourſelves. For to no nation beſides the United States can that antient ſaying be more emphatically applied; BY UNIT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ING WE STAND, BY DIVIDING WE FALL.</p>
