            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

Father's Nakedneſs: Gen. 9 26. <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord God of Shem, and Canaan ſhall be his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And in this Chapter we ſhall Obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That Joſhua is Divinely called to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> Moſes the Servant of the Lord was dead, and God appoints Joſhua to ſtand up in his ſtead, and Lead His People over Jordan; and encourages him with gracious Promiſes of Aſſiſtance &amp; Succeſs, from the 1<hi>st.</hi> to the 10<hi>th.</hi> Verſe. It is God's work to give Rulers to a People. This Promotion comes neither from the Eaſt nor from the Weſt, nor from the South; but God is the Judge, and He ſetteth up whomſoever He will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 6, 7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Joſhua accepts the Government,</hi> and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes himſelf to the Buſineſs of it, giving the needful Orders to all the Officers, from the 10<hi>th.</hi> to the 16<hi>th.</hi> Verſe. Whatever humble apprehenſions <hi>Joſhua</hi> (tho' a very worthy man) might have of the Diſparity between himſelf and <hi>Moſes, his ſo great a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor,</hi> and of the Difficulty he might meet with in Managing ſo rough a People, as he knew they had been, yet GOD's Call muſt ſilence all Objections; and the Promiſe of the Divine Preſence was enough to animate him with Courage chearfully to enter upon the great Work.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:002741_0004_0FE61D78451DA1A0"/>
3. <hi>The People agree to it:</hi> Joſhua ſhall be their Chief and Head; and virtually at leaſt take an Oath of Fidelity to him. And whom ſhould they Serve, but him whom the LORD had Choſen to go before them? And they anſwered <hi>Joſhua,</hi> ſaying, All that thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandeſt us we will do, &amp; whitherſoever thou ſendeſt us we will go: According as we hearkened unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in all things, ſo will we hearken unto thee; Only the Lord thy God be with thee, as He was with <hi>Moſes.</hi> This Anſwer was made to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> not only by the <hi>Reubenites</hi> &amp; <hi>Gadites</hi> and half-Tribe of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſeh,</hi> to whom <hi>Moſes</hi> had laſt of all directed his Speech, but all the Rulers of the People to whom he firſt gave Commandment, <hi>V.</hi> 10. In their own behalf and in behalf of all the People,</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Promiſe him Obedience, both as Subjects and Souldiers.</hi> All that thou commandeſt us we will do, and whitherſoever thou ſendeſt us we will go. And leſt Joſhua ſhould fear that his Intereſt in their Affections was too ſmall and that their Subjection to him would be but cool and indifferent, to remove this Suſpicion they amplify their Promiſe &amp; tell him, That as they hearkened in all things unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſo they would likewiſe hearken unto him. They had no great cauſe to glory in the goodneſs of their Behaviour under and
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:002741_0005_0FE61D784CA45FB8"/>
toward <hi>Moſes.</hi> They had ſufficiently made known their Rebellious Spirit and Stiff-neck to him, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31. 27. But altho, the Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that were brought up in <hi>Egypt</hi> and fell in the Wilderneſs, were ſtubborn &amp; froward, yet their Children that were brought up in the Wilderneſs under <hi>Moſes,</hi> and now made the Promiſe to <hi>Joſhua</hi> might have been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Behaved<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Henry</hi> in Loc.</note>. A good Government hath a mighty influence into the Manners &amp; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour of men: And it is a great advantage to be Educated under able and pious Guides. Theſe <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that were brought up under <hi>Moſes,</hi> carried themſelves well, both under him and under <hi>Joſhua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>They aſſiſt Joſhua with their good Wiſhes in his great Undertaking.</hi> Only the Lord thy God be with thee as He was with <hi>Moſes.</hi> They don't make it a condition of their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience; nor ſay, They will be no longer Subject to him than he ſhall be Proſperous. They knew <hi>Joſhua</hi> well and don't ſeem to have laboured under a fear of his Provoking God to forſake him, or of God's failing to make good His Promiſe to <hi>Joſhua.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>As I was with Moſes, ſo I will be with thee, I will not leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> They only pray it might be unto <hi>Joſhua</hi> according to
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002741_0005_0FE61D784CA45FB8"/>
God's Word; and tacitly Exhort him to keep himſelf in a capacity of God's continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p n="1">[1.] <hi>They gratefully acknowledge the Bleſſing they had in Moſes:</hi> That he was a man that had much of the Preſence of God with him in his Publick Adminiſtrations; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their Obedience unto him was not Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merited. They expreſs their Piety to GOD, &amp; their Regards to <hi>Moſes.</hi> They aſcribe the Glory of all the great things done for them by the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> unto GOD. It was His Preſence with <hi>Moſes</hi> which was the chief Cauſe of all the many worthy Deeds that had been done for them, by him; And they remember <hi>Moſes</hi> as a Man greatly owned of GOD in his Place and favoured much with the Divine Preſence in his Conduct.</p>
            <p n="2">[2] <hi>They put Reſpect upon Joſhua, wiſhing the bleſſing of his Predeceſſor might come upon him:</hi> As they purpoſed to pay the like Obedience to him which they gave to <hi>Moſes.</hi> They had changed their Ruler, but were concerned that they might not loſe that which had been the beauty and the ſtrength of their Government, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz</hi>
               </abbr> the Preſence of GOD with their Ruler: and therefore pray that the Spirit of <hi>Moſes</hi> might reſt in a double portion upon <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and that the ſame GOD that

had helped <hi>Moſes</hi> all his Days, would carry <hi>Joſhua</hi> well through all his Work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Note,</hi> As Gratitude to the Father of Lights from whom comes every good &amp; perfect gift, obliges us not to be wanting, in paying all due Regards to the memory of the Dead, that have been eminently Uſeful &amp; Services able among us in Publick Capacities, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhould we forget to Honour the Living that ſucceed them in their Characters and Labours. The Iſraelites make honourable Mention of deceaſed <hi>Moſes,</hi> and pay a due Deference unto ſucceeding <hi>Joſhua.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But our Preſent work is to Clear and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the following</p>

               <label>DOCTRINE.</label>
               <hi>It is much to be deſired that Civil Rulers may have much of the Preſence of GOD with them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was it upon which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſo highly Valued <hi>Moſes;</hi> and it ſeems to have been a proſpect of this that made them ſo chearful and full in their Promiſes unto <hi>Joſhua.</hi>

And when God gives leave to us to chooſe Rulers for our ſelves, He limits our Choice to ſuch as He hath already Gifted &amp; Prepared. Agreeable therefore to the Divine Will, was the Counſel of <hi>Jethro</hi> to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 18. 21.

God of all Grace, for the Benefit of a People, in them that bear Rule, hath been ſhewn by others on theſe Occaſions, to which I refer you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That they may be well ſpirited to their Work.</hi> And indeed this is of main Conſideration in this affair, that ſuch as are concerned in the Government of a People, ſhould have a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſition to the Duties of it. It is the Apoſtle's Command, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12. 11. That we be not ſlothful in Buſineſs, <hi>but</hi> fervent in ſpirit ſerving the Lord. And our Zeal ſhould bear a proportion to the Service we have to do for GOD. Civil Rulers then ſhould be men warmly affected to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Good, and in good earneſt to approve themſelves Benefactors to mankind. It is for this end Government is ordained. Rom. 13. 4. <hi>He is the miniſter of God to thee for good.</hi> And the Ruler, whoſe heart is right with God, will ſet himſelf to deviſe liberal things for the good of a People; and ſpare no Pains, nor leave any Stone unturned to advance the Publick Intereſt. He will labour to draw others into the Paths of Vertue &amp; Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, by going before them in a bright Example; and will be very careful that there be nothing in his Converſation that may be a Stumbling-block to others, or an occaſion of Sin. If he have Power thereunto, he will
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002741_0008_0FE61D842855F938"/>
gladly help forward the Enacting of good Laws, however he will do what in him lies, to keep up the Credit of ſuch good Laws as are Enacted for the Baniſhing Wickedneſs out of the Land, and the Advancing Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Religion, that they may not Sink into Contempt and become Enervated. He will Faithfully Execute Judgment on Tranſgreſſors, and in his Zeal will ſay with upright David, Pſal. 101. 8. <hi>I will Early de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all the Wicked of the Land: that I may cut off all Wicked doers from the City of the Lord.</hi> His Influences on others will be not a little conducive to their good Behaviour. Much Good will be done by him thro' his Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancing, and Beſtowing marks of his Favour, on them that are found in the ways of well doing. And his frowns will weaken the hands of the Wicked, that they may turn from their Evil way. He will not only En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to do Good himſelf, but will help forward and encourage others in being Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly Serviceable. So did <hi>Hezekiah</hi> who ſpake Comfortably to the <hi>Levites</hi> that taught the good Knowledge of the LORD. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30. 22.</p>
            <p>But without this Zeal of how little Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit are they like to be to the World, whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be their Ability's or Authority. Of what worth is a Talent that is wrapt up in a

Such will be in Effect but meer Titular Rulers, but Idol-gods, that have Eyes but ſee not the faults of Men, Ears but hear not the cry of the Poor, Mouths but ſpeak not for the relief of the Oppreſſed in the gate, and Hands but revenge not the wrongs done by Tranſgreſſors. Indeed the greateſt defect of Men in every Station and of every Degree lies here, That they have more Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity than Heart to their Duty. What thro' the Power of Luſts within, and the many Temptations that are without, there is much of that Good neglected &amp; goes undone that we are both fitted for and called to do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>To Support them under the burden of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> Which is not a matter of meer Honour, Pleaſure and Profit, (as ſome ſeem vainly to Dream; and therefore Ignorantly envy others their preferments,) but an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment full of Labour and Travel, Care and Solicitude, Expence and Charge, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and Danger, &amp; therefore calls for much of the Divine Preſence Aſſiſtance &amp; Support under the preſence of it. <hi>David</hi> compares the managing of Government to the <hi>bearing up</hi> the Pillars of the Earth. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 75. 3.

And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found Favour in thy Sight; and let me not ſee my Wretchedneſs.</hi> It is ſaid that <hi>Domeſthenes,</hi> after a long Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the Common Wealth, confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to his Friends, that if in the beginning, the choice had been given him of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, or of his Grave, if he could have foreſeen the Evils, the Terrors, the Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, the Envies, the Contentions, the Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that Men in ſuch Capacity's uſually meet with, he would, with much Alacrity have Poſted on to his Sepulchre rather than to his Greatneſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Humane Prudence.</hi>

That I were made Judge in the Land, that every man which hath any Suit or Cauſe, might come unto me, and I would do him Juſtice</hi> And as <hi>Korah</hi> did <hi>Moſes'</hi>s, Numb. 16. 3. <hi>Ye</hi> [Moſes &amp; Aaron] <hi>take too much upon you, ſeeing all the Congregation are holy every one of them:</hi> And you ought not therefore thus to uſurp Domination over them: And had doubtleſs made greater Confuſion in Iſrael, had not the Glorious GOD ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly interpoſed his own Authority for the protection of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the ſafety of the People. And in times of Degeneracy and Diſtreſs, the Clamours of the People are wont to be thrown againſt the Rulers, as if they were the Authors of all their Calamities &amp; Sufferings. Nor is it to be expected that the <hi>Earthly Gods</hi> ſhould meet with better Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from impatient Men, than the <hi>Great GOD of Heaven;</hi> whom they are wont

at ſuch a time, more directly or more indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, by Thoughts or Words or Actions, or all of them to Reproach and Blaſpheme.

            <p n="4">4. <hi>To Proſper their Endeavours for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick good.</hi> It is not the Wiſdom of the Wiſe, nor the Counſel of the Prudent, nor the Politicks of States-men can raiſe a Common Wealth or make one Flouriſh. The Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of <hi>Babel</hi> (probably <hi>Nimrod</hi> &amp; his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plices) are a pregnant Inſtance of this.

was not with them to Succeed their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours; but frowned upon their Enterprize, and ſo it fell to the ground. <hi>Edom</hi> thought to have Built his deſolate Places when he was impoveriſhed, but he reckoned without his hoſt; for what faith the Lord of Hoſts? <hi>They ſhall build, but I will throw down,</hi> Mal. 1 4.</p>
            <p>If the deſigns be never ſo Pious, and they that form them be very Zealous too, yet without this, their Labour will be all ſpent for nought and in vain A work of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation will ſtick in the Birth, if God give not ſtrength to bring forth. The high Places, where the People worſhipped contrary to the Divine Commandment, were not taken away in the Days of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming Prince; becauſe <hi>the Lord had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the hearts of the People</hi> (for the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the heart is from the Lord) <hi>to the God of their Fathers,</hi> 2 Chron. 20. 33.

            <p>Without this, they can be no Safety nor Protection to a People, nor prevent impend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Calamities from breaking in upon them. Pſal. 127. 1 <hi>Except the LORD keep the City, the

&amp; Conſtancy, rendred him our Safety abroad and Strength at home. He was indeed, <hi>Et Praeſidium &amp; dulce decus noſtrum,</hi> Our Chariots &amp; our Horſemen.</p>
            <p>His Concern for the <hi>Houſe of GOD,</hi> in bringing about the Eſtabliſhment of our Churches by a Law; and ſo taking them into his own Arms and placing them under the Paternal Care &amp; Protection of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

            <p>He was taken from us as <hi>Moſes</hi> from <hi>Iſrael</hi> when his Eye was not dim, nor his Natural force abated, and left us to Sigh out our Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows in the words of the Lamenting Prophet, Lam 5. 16. <hi>The Crown is fallen from our Head: We unto us that we have Sinned.</hi>

If they be under a Wiſe &amp; Good Conduct, and Succeeded in their way, we ſhall reap the Benefit; but if their Wiſdom periſh &amp; their Counſel &amp; Endeavours for us come to nought, we ſhall be the Sufferers. How much doth it Concern us then to Labour in this matter? It is this muſt make us an Happy People, and our State Proſperous. The Common Wealth, the Publick Good can't flouriſh but under a Wiſe &amp; good Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. If any think this not material, and thro' weakneſs or wickedneſs, deſpiſe &amp; hate <hi>Knowlege &amp; Wiſdom</hi> in them that bear Rule,

the <hi>Queen of the South</hi> ſhall riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt them &amp; ſhall Condemn them; for ſhe pronounced Iſrael Bleſſed, when ſhe ſaw how GOD was with <hi>Solomon,</hi> and with what meaſures of Wiſdom his Affairs were ordered, and conſequently his Kingdom ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred: 2 Chron. 9. 7, 8. <hi>Happy are thy Men, and happy are theſe thy Servants, which ſtand continually before thee, and hear thy Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Bleſſed be the LORD thy GOD, which delighted in thee to ſet thee on his Throne, to be King for the LORD thy GOD: becauſe thy GOD loved Iſrael, to Eſtabliſh them for ever, therefore made He thee King over them, to do Judgment and Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And altho' GOD be Sovereign of His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, and diſpenſe them unto whom and when He will; Nevertheleſs there are Courſes for us to take, that lead to our good herein, and we may contribute much to this matter.

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Let all that are concerned to Elect Perſons to Places of Truſt and Government, aim at this in their Choice.</hi> And be not Governed by any Siniſter Views.

But let your Eyes be on the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and the Faithful of the Land; and look out men of Renown, known in your Tribes, whom GOD hath Exalted by His Gifts, and Promote them by your Election.
