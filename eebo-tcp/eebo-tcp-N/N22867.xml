            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I HAVE ſeldom known a greater pleaſure than I now feel, in rendering you my thanks, in this public manner, for your ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed efforts in the cauſe of order and <hi>true</hi> liberty. Your work, Sir, has met with the approbation of all who have read it on this ſide the Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic, the enemies of mankind excepted; and, as to myſelf, I preſume I could not give a more unequivocal proof of my high opinion of it, than by ſubmitting it to the peruſal of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the United States of America.</p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of the American Jacobins, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly denominated Democrats, which I have attempted in the following pages, ſeemed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſupply a deficiency, which, undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, is to be attributed to your want of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated materials. I am well aware, that
<pb facs="unknown:030209_0003_0FF12C43338C4618"/>
the reader will, at every ſtep, regret that this part of the taſk alſo did not fall to your lot; but, the experience I have had of the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the public, emboldens me to truſt to it once more, though under the enormous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage of following ſuch a writer as Mr. Playfair.</p>

            <head>HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN JACOBINS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHEN the Jacobins of Paris ſent forth their miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries of inſurrection and anarchy, their profeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed object was to enlighten the ignorant and unchain the enſlaved. There was ſomehitng prepoſterous in the idea of Frenchmen giving liberty to the world; but, had it been poſſible for men in their ſenſes to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that a club of diſtracted Monſieurs, who knew not the meaning of the word liberty, were calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for this arduous taſk and were ſerious in their profeſſions, ſuch credulous perſons muſt have been at once undeceived, when they obſerved, that the newly-enlightened miſſionaries were diſpatched to thoſe countries alone where the greateſt degree of civil liberty was already to be found. Had the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gande at Paris been ſincere in their profeſſions, why were not their envoys directed towards Ruſſia and Turkey, inſtead of England, America, and other free ſtates? The fact is, Briſſot and his philanthropic colleagues wanted to draw as many foreign nations as poſſible within the vortex of their own ſavage
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:030209_0005_0FF12C4B2CAF7400"/>
ſyſtem, and they well knew, that where the voice of the people has the moſt weight in public affairs, there it is moſt eaſy to introduce novel and ſubverſive doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines.</p>
            <p>In ſuch ſtates too, there generally, not to ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways, exiſts a party, who, from the long habit of hating thoſe who adminiſter the government, become the enemies of the government itſelf, and are ready to ſell their treacherous ſervices to the firſt bidder. To this deſcription of men the ſect of the Jacobins have attached themſelves, in every country they have been ſuffered to enter. They are a ſort of fleſh flies, that naturally ſettle on the excremental and corrupted parts of the body politic. It is well known what aid they have received from the diſaffected of ſeveral European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but, neither the Malcontents in Geneva, the Patriots in Holland, nor the Reformers in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and Ireland, were half ſo well adapted to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of Jacobinical doctrines and Louis d'ors as the <hi>Anti-federaliſts</hi> in America. This faction was co-exiſtent with the General Government of the Union. Notwithſtanding the neceſſity of eſtabliſhing this go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and its mild and equitable principles, it did not fail to meet with a formidable oppoſition. The perſons who compoſed this oppoſition, and who thence took the name <hi>Anti-federaliſts,</hi> were not equal to the Federaliſts, either in point of riches or reſpectability. They were, in general, men of bad moral characters, embarraſſed in their private affairs, or the tools of ſuch as were. Men of this caſt naturally feared the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a government endued with ſufficient ſtrength to make itſelf reſpected, and with ſufficient wiſdom to exclude the ignorant and wicked from a ſhare in its adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>However, the <hi>Anti-federaliſts</hi> attracted notice, and acquired conſequence. A hypocritical anxiety for the preſervation of the liberties of the people made up for a want of every real virtue. Some of the ſtates re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, for a long time, to accede to the new Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:030209_0006_0FF12C50419E17D0"/>
and many individuals, in thoſe ſtates which did accede to it, remained obſtinately oppoſed to its principles.</p>
            <p>Thus did the Federal Government receive, at its birth, the ſeeds of a diſeaſe, which, unleſs its friends diſcover more zeal than they have hitherto done, will one day accompliſh its deſtruction. It began its career in defiance of a party, organized and marſhalled, and ready to ſeize the favourable moment for attacking it with open force. We ſhall ſoon ſee that this moment was at no great diſtance.</p>
            <p>The happy effects of the new ſyſtem, which were almoſt inſtantaneouſly felt, operated ſo forcibly on the minds of the people at large, that the Anti-federaliſts began to feel themſelves abaſhed. Seeing their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers daily diminiſh, they found it prudent to hide their diſcontent; nor would their clamors have ſince been revived, had they not been encouraged and backed by the uſurpers in France. The ſucceſsful example, the promiſes, and, above all, the gold of theſe latter, have emboldened them again to ſhew their heads; as the rays of the ſun draw the adder from the loathſome retreat, where he has lain engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering and bloating over his poiſon.</p>
            <p>The French uſurpers, from the moment they had got a firm graſp of the reins of power, loſt no time in engaging this deſperate faction in their views, which were, to acquire a perfect command of the American government, and force it into the war of Liberty and Equality. Monſieur Ternant, the then ambaſſador here, was, beſides his being ſent by a king, very juſtly looked upon as unfit for managing the intrigues of Briſſot and his brother regicides. He had ever been accuſtomed to live on terms of friendſhip with the officers of government, and to treat their communications with becoming reſpect. Citizen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net was therefore diſpatched to ſupply his place: a man every way qualified for the million he had to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute.
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030209_0007_0FF12C531566B6C8"/>
Educated in the ſubaltern walks of the moſt intriguing court in Europe, he was verſed in all the menial offices of corruption; and unencumbered with the family pride of the French Chevaliers, he could viſit a democratic club, and give the fraternal buſs to its ſhirtleſs members, with that kind of cordiality, which gives a zeſt to flattery, and ſeldom fails to gain the affections of the grovelling heart. If the Citizen has hitherto failed of ultimate ſucceſs, we muſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute his failure to the deep penetration and inflexible integrity he had to encounter, rather than to any want of cunning, induſtry or <hi>liberality</hi> on his part.</p>
            <p>The attachment of the Federal Government to a pacific ſyſtem was well known in France. Genet was therefore inſtructed, in caſe he ſhould not be able to ſhake this attachment either by promiſes or threats, to apply himſelf to the ſovereign people themſelves, whoſe partiality, it had been repreſented, and with but too much truth, had received a ſtrong bias in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the uſurpers. In order to pave the way for acting in the laſt reſort, he diſembarked at a point the moſt diſtant from the ſeat of government, that he might have it in his power to act on ſome part of the people at leaſt, before the ſentiments of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment reſpecting him and his miſſion were known. He accordingly landed at Charleſton, South Carolina, where he remained caballing for ſome time, and then proceeded to Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of Charleſton, and, indeed, of moſt parts of South Carolina, were admirably diſpoſed for a warm reception of Genet. Not long before his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a propoſition had been publiſhed for a ſolemn abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition of the uſe "of all ariſtocratical terms of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirction</hi> and <hi>reſpect.</hi>" The levellers had even propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed having an engagement to this effect, printed and ſtuck up in the ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>et-places, court-houſes, &amp;c. for the ſignature of the citizens. In a ſtate where ſans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culottiſm had already made ſuch a progreſs, the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating preſence of the Pariſian Miſſionary was all
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030209_0008_0FF12C561001A800"/>
that could be wanted to complete the farce. The Carolinians had cut the ſtrings of their culottes, and the Citizen pulled them down about their heels.</p>
            <p>The frigate, L'Ambuſcade, that brought Genet to America, brought alſo the news of war being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared by France againſt England. The inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Southern climes have never been famous for their wiſdom; accordingly, the people of Charleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton looked upon a prize, which the Ambuſcade brought in with her, as an earneſt of ſucceſs, and an indubitable indication of French naval ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was Genet on ſhore, than he began to exerciſe his powers, as ſovereign of the country. He commiſſioned land and ſea officers, to make war upon the Spaniſh and Engliſh; he fitted out privateers, and opened rendezvouſes for the enrolling of both ſoldiers and ſailors. The French flag was ſeen waving from the windows in this ſans-culotte city, juſt as if it had been a ſea-port of France. Genet was ſent expreſsly to engage the country to take a part in the war, and ſuch was his contempt for the government, that he did not look upon its conſent as a thing worth aſking for, or thinking about.</p>
            <p>The Citizen found more volunteers than he knew what to do with, particularly of the higher ranks: Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Commodores, Majors and Colonels, flocked to his ſtandard in ſuch crowds, that had he had a hundred reams of paper in blank commiſſions, he might have filled them all up in the State of Carolina. Whether theſe men of high rank and empty purſes were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by the confidence they had in the power of the French, or by their own inſtinctive bravery, I know not; but as to the end they had in view, there can be little doubt. For one of them, who was actuated by a love of liberty, there were five hundred who were actuated by a love of plunder. Some of them longed for a dive into the Spaniſh mines, and, in idea,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030209_0009_0FF12C5A95648830"/>
already heard the chinking of the doubloons; while others were eyeing the Britiſh merchant-men with that kind of ſavage deſire, with which the wolf ſurveys a herd of fat oxen.</p>
            <p>After having remained at Charleſton from the 9th to the 19th of April 1793, the <hi>Sans-culotte corps Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plomatique,</hi> marched off for Philadelphia, where it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived on the 9th of May.</p>
            <p>I avoid mentioning the proceſſions, banquets, &amp;c. that attended the Citizen during his journey; nor ſhould I think it worth while to give an account of his reception at the capital, were I not aſſured that the civilians of the Rights of Man will hereafter quote it as a precedent in the laws of their ceremonial.</p>
            <p>The city had been duly prepared for this famous public entry by paragraphs in the papers, announcing the Citizen's arrival at the different ſtages on the road. Expectation was kept on tip-toe for ſeveral days. The beſt penmen among the patriots were at work com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing congratulatory addreſſes, and their choiceſt orators were gargling their throats to pronounce them. At laſt, on the happy 16th of May, a <hi>ſalve</hi> from the cannons of a frigate lying in the port, gave notice that the Citizen would ſoon be arrived a place called Gray's Ferry, about three miles diſtant from the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Thither all the patrioticly diſpoſed went, to meet him, and eſcort him to his dwelling. In the evening of the ſame day there was, what was called, a meeting of the citizens of Philadelphia, when it was agreed to appoint a committee to draft an addreſs to him. An addreſs was accordingly prepared, ſubmitted to the ſovereign citizens, at a ſecond meeting, highly approved of, and another committee, conſiſting of about half a hundred perſons, appointed to carry it up.— But I muſt now avail myſelf of their own account of the buſineſs, feeling a total want of capacity to do it juſtice. <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Gazette of <hi>Poor Richard's Grand-Child,</hi> of the 20th of May 1793.</note>

               <p>The citizens aſſembled expreſſing a deſire to accompany their committee in preſenting the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to the Citizen miniſter, two gentlemen were diſpatched to know what time it would be conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for him to receive it, and they returned in a few minutes with the following report: "That Mr. Genet had expreſſed a high ſenſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment intended to be paid him by the citizens of Philadelphia; that he was ſolicitous to avoid giving them the trouble of another meeting, and that if they would accept the ſpontaneous effuſions of his heart, which, however deficient in point of form, would not be deficient in ſincerity, as an anſwer to the addreſs, he would be happy to receive it immediately, leaving to the enſuing day the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of a written reply."—"The citizens teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified their approbation of the miniſter's propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>reiterated ſhouts of applauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The committee, headed by their chairman, and followed by an immenſe body of citizens, walking three abreaſt, having arrived at the City-tavern, were introduced into the preſence, and after the <hi>acclamations, as well in the houſe as in the ſtreets,</hi> had ceaſed, the addreſs was delivered, at the cloſe of which <hi>the houſe and ſtreets again reſounded with congratulations and applauſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Citizen Genet, evidently <hi>affected with the warmth of the public attachment,</hi> thus conveyed, delivered an extemporaneous reply, in terms which <hi>touched the feelings</hi> of every auditor, &amp;c.—It is impoſſible to deſcribe, with adequate <hi>energy,</hi> the ſcene that ſucceeded. <hi>Shouts</hi> and <hi>ſalutations</hi> were not unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>other evidences</hi> of the effect, which this int<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="6 letters">

                  </gap>ing interview had <hi>upon the paſſions</hi> of the parties who were engaged in it.—From the citizens in the room the miniſter turned his attention to the citizens in the ſtreet, and addreſſed them in a few ſhort but emphatic ſentences, from one of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:030209_0011_0FF12C5F28B222F8"/>In this inſtance we ſee the ſovereign people taking the liberty to act for themſelves, while their ſervants, the officers of government, ſtand looking on. What right, I would be glad to know, had the people of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, even ſuppoſing them all aſſembled together, to acknowledge any man as a public miniſter, before he had been acknowledged and received as ſuch by the General Government? No wonder that this inſolent miſſionary ſhould conceive, that that government was a mere cypher; and many of thoſe who afterwards complained of his appeal to the people, ſhould have recollected, that they had encouraged him ſo to do.</p>
            <p>For ſome time after the Citizen's arrival, there was nothing but addreſſing and feaſting him. It may not be amiſs to give an account of one of theſe treats; the memory of ſuch ſcenes ſhould be preſerved, and often brought into view.</p>
            <q>
               <p>On Saturday laſt a <hi>republican dinner</hi> was given at Oellers's hotel, to <hi>Citizen Genet,</hi> by a reſpectable number of French and American citizens. After dinner a number of patriotic toaſts were drunk, of which the following is a tranſlation:
<list>
                     <item>1. Liberty and Equality.</item>
                     <item>2. The French Republic.</item>
                     <item>3. The United States, &amp;c. &amp;c.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>After the third toaſt, an <hi>elegant ode,</hi> ſuited to the occaſion, compoſed by a young Frenchman, was read by Citizen <hi>Duponceau,</hi> and univerſally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded. The ſociety, <hi>on motion</hi> [to be ſure, <hi>on motion</hi>] ordered that <hi>Citizen Freneau</hi> ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to tranſlate it into Engliſh verſe, and that the original and tranſlation ſhould be publiſhed.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <q>After a ſhort interval, the <hi>Marſeillois's Hymn</hi> was, upon the requeſt of the citizens, ſung by Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen <hi>Bournonville,</hi> with great taſte and ſpirit, the <hi>whole company joining in the chorus.</hi>
               </q>— I leave
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030209_0012_0FF12C61B562BB98"/>
the reader to gueſs at the harmony of this chorus, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed forth from the drunken lungs of about a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred fellows, of a dozen different nations. Who would have thought five and thirty years ago, when the inhabitants of Pennſylvania were petitioning King George for protection againſt the French and their allies, the ſcalping Indians, that in the year 1793, the people of Philadelphia would carry their complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance to a French miniſter ſo far, as to ape his outland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh howling in the chorus of a murderer's ſong! But, let us proceed with the feaſt.—<q>Two additional ſtanzas to the <hi>Marſeillois's Hymn,</hi> compoſed by <hi>Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Genet,</hi> and ſuited to the <hi>navy</hi> of France, were then called for, ſung, and encored.</q>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>Before the ſinging of the Hymn, it ſhould be mentioned, that a <hi>deputation from the ſailors</hi> of the frigate, L'Ambuſcade, made their appearance, <hi>em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced,</hi> and took their ſeats.</p>
               <p>The table was decorated with the tree and cap of liberty, and with the French and American Flags. The laſt toaſt being drunk, the cap of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty was placed on the head of <hi>Citizen Genet,</hi> and then it <hi>travelled from head to head,</hi> round the table [juſt as the guillotine has ſince travelled round France] each wearer enlivening the ſcene with a patriotic ſentiment.</p>
               <p>Theſe tokens of liberty, and of American and French fraternity, were delivered to the officers and mariners of the frigate, L'Ambuſcade, who promiſed to defend them till death.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Thus rolled Genet's time away, in a variety of ſuch nonſenſical, ſtupid, unmeaning, childiſh enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, as never were heard or thought of, till Frenchmen took it into their heads to gabble about liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:030209_0013_0FF12C6464F9AED8"/>On the very day that this liberty-cap feaſt took place, the citizen miniſter was formally received, and acknowledged in his diplomatic capacity, by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the United States. There, indeed, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception was not quite ſo warm. He afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that the firſt object that ſtruck his eye in the chamber, was the buſt of Louis XVI. I never heard whether he ſtarted back or not, at the ſight; but it is certain he looked upon it as an ill omen. He ſaw that he had not to do with a man, whoſe friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſhifted with the changes of fortune. He ſaw that the Preſident had not been deceived by the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies heaped on the unfortunate king; and that, though the welfare of his country induced him to receive an envoy from his murderers, he was far from approving of their deeds.</p>
            <p>This ſilent reproof, which muſt, however, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to mere accident, ſtung the inſolent Genet to the ſoul. His reſenting it is a ſtriking inſtance of that overbearing ſpirit which the rulers of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded French have ever diſcovered. Becauſe they had killed their king, hurled down the ſtatues of his anceſtors, and dug their rotten bones from the tomb, they had the preſumption to think, that the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors of other nations ought to follow the ſavage example.</p>
            <p>But, a cold reception was not the rub that Genet moſt complained of. The Federal Government, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of his bold beginnings at Charleſton, made no doubt that his inſtructions went to the engaging it in the war. Indeed theſe inſtructions were made known from the moment of his landing; and it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted but this had influence on the conduct of the government; for an article appeared in the Charleſton papers, the day after, ſpecifying that a report had gained ground, that the Federal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment <hi>muſt</hi> take a part in the war; and this arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle made its appearance at Philadelphia, on the very day that the Preſident's proclamation, declaring it the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:030209_0014_0FF12C68DB111F78"/>
reſolution of the United ſtates to remain neuter, was firſt promulgated.</p>
            <p>This wiſe and determined ſtep Genet's maſters had not foreſeen; or, if they did foreſee it, they were not aware that it would be taken, before their miſſionary could find time to make his warlike pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals. This was a moſt cruel diſappointment to the Citizen, and completely baffled all his projects. In vain did he endeavour to draw the old General from his ground, neither promiſes nor threats had any effect on him, and Genet ſoon found, that he had no hope but in rouſing the people to oppoſe their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>A man of more penetration than Genet might have conceived ſuch a project feaſible, from the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent partiality that every where appeared towards the French, from the little reſpect teſtified for the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the government, and particularly from the freedom, not to ſay audacity, with which its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, in iſſuing the proclamation of neutrality, was arraigned. Beſides, the Anti-federal faction began to appear with more boldneſs than ever. Genet was continually ſurrounded with them; and, as they ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for nothing ſo much as for war, they ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in the opinion, that the people would ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately decide in his favour.</p>
            <p>But, there wanted ſomething like a regular plan to unite their forces, and bring them to act in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert. A dinner here and a ſupper there, were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all. The drunkards went home, ſnorted themſelves ſober, and returned to their employments. It was not as in France, where a ſingle tap upon a drum head, would aſſemble <hi>canaille</hi> enough to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn forty Federal Governments in the ſpace of half a night. In America there exiſted all the materials for a revolution, but they were ſcattered here and there; affiliated clubs were wanting to render them compact, and manageable, as occaſion might demand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:030209_0015_0FF12C6B870EFDD8"/>Genet did not judge it prudent to give to the American Jacobins the ſame name, that had been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed by thoſe in France: that would have been too glaring an imitation. <hi>Democratic</hi> was thought leſs offenſive, at the ſame time that it was well adapted to a ſociety of men, who were about to ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up for the watch-dogs of a government, which they pretended was already become <hi>too ariſtocratic,</hi> and was daily growing more ſo; but that a Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crat was but another name for a Jacobin no one had the folly to deny, when, afterwards, ſome of theſe very clubs were known to ſend petitions for having their names entered on the regiſters of the Jacobin club at Paris.</p>
            <p>The Mother Club, in America, met at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia on the 3d of July, 1793, about ſix or ſeven weeks after Genet's arrival in the city, during which ſpace, it is well aſcertained, more than <hi>twenty thouſand Louis d'ors</hi> had been diſtributed.</p>
            <p>As it is here, properly ſpeaking, that the Hiſtory of the American Jacobins, or Democrats, begins, it ſeems neceſſary to give ſome account of their <hi>conſtitution,</hi> as they termed it. This anarchical act ſets out with a preamble containing the principles under which the members had united, and it then proceeds to the rules and regulations for tranſacting the buſineſs of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>

                  <p>We have the pleaſure to communicate to you a copy of the conſtitution of the <hi>Democratic Society,</hi> in hopes that after a candid conſideration of its principles, and objects, you may be induced to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote its adoption, in the county of which you are an inhabitant.</p>
                  <p>Every mind, capable of reflection, muſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that the preſent criſis in the politics of nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is peculiarly intereſting to America. The Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean Confederacy, tranſcendent in power, and unparalleled in iniquity, menaces the very exiſtence of freedom. Already its baneful operation may be traced in the tyrannical deſtruction of the Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Poland: and ſhould the glorious efforts of France be eventually defeated, we have reaſon to preſume, that, for the conſummation of monarchical ambition, and the ſecurity of its eſtabliſhments, this country, the only remaining depoſitory of liberty, will not long be permitted to enjoy in peace, the honours of an independent, and the happineſs of a republican government.</p>
                  <p>Nor are the dangers ariſing from a foreign ſource, the only cauſes, at this time, of apprehenſion and ſolicitude. The <hi>ſeeds of luxury</hi> appear to have taken root in our domeſtic ſoil: and the <hi>jealous eye of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm</hi> already regards the <hi>ſpirit of freedom and equality,</hi> as eclipſed by the <hi>pride of wealth</hi> and the <hi>arrogance of power.</hi>

                  <p>To obtain theſe objects, then, and to cultivate on all occaſions, the love of peace, order, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; an attachment to the conſtitution, and a reſpect to the laws of our country, will be the aim of the <hi>Democratic Society,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            <p>Never did a piece of political hypocriſy come forth to public view under ſuch a flimſy diſguiſe as this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular letter. People ſtared to ſee that there were men amongſt them poſſeſſed of impudence enough, thus to invite them to revolt againſt the conſtitution, under the pretext of preſerving it in its purity. The Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans can ſwallow a pretty comfortable doſe of any thing that is ſtrongly ſeaſoned with <hi>liberty and equality,</hi> but there were few, above the mere vulgar, whoſe ſtomachs did not turn at this.</p>
            <p>How <hi>democratic ſocieties</hi> were to protect the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try againſt the monarchs of Europe ſeemed a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. What ſtandard were they to raiſe for the people to find ſhelter under, in the hour of danger and diſtreſs? Nothing is clearer, than that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination was intended to operate againſt the General Government, and againſt that alone. They ſet out with talking about the dangers to be apprehended from foreign powers, but they ſoon come to the point; the ſpirit of <hi>freedom and equality,</hi> they ſay, is eclipſed by the <hi>pride of wealth</hi> and <hi>arrogance of power.</hi> It is
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030209_0019_0FF12C76F004F030"/>
to combat theſe, that they invoke the aid of their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens.</p>
            <p>Indeed a political club, if it is not intended to ſtrengthen the government, muſt be intended to act againſt it. The very foundation of ſuch a club muſt imply a ſyſtematic oppoſition to the lawful rules of the land; it is an act of rebellion, unpuniſhable by law 'tis true, but which will ever be puniſhed by the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of all peaceable and honeſt men.</p>
            <p>No one can read the concluding paragraph of this letter, without calling to mind the profeſſions of the French and Engliſh Jacobins: the former united themſelves under the name of, <q>Les Amis de la Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</q> (the friends of the Conſtitution), and the latter, under that of, <hi>"The Conſtitutional Society."</hi> What ſort of <hi>friends</hi> to the Conſtitution (of 1791) the Jacobins of Paris were, their ſubſequent conduct, and the ſate of that Conſtitution, have fully proved; and it would be ſinning againſt conviction to ſuppoſe, that thoſe of England and America exceeded them in ſincerity. The patriots, or <hi>reformers</hi> (call them which you pleaſe) who emigrate from England, throw off the diſguiſe as ſoon as their feet touch the ſhore. They tell you, that their intention was to deſtroy "the old rotten conſtitution of Britain," from which they took their name; and there is not the leaſt doubt, but the Democrats would be as candid with reſpect to the American conſtitution, were they landed in France.</p>
            <p>As to thoſe who placed themſelves at the head of the Democrats, ſpeaking of them generally, they were very little eſteemed, either as private or public characters. Few of them were men of property, and ſuch as were, owed their poſſeſſions to ſome caſual circumſtance, rather than to family, induſtry, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents. The bulk of political reformers is always com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of needy, diſcontented men, too indolent or impatient to advance themſelves by fair and honeſt

            <p>The effects of the inſtitution ſoon became apparent from one end of the United States to the other. The blaze did not, indeed, communicate itſelf with ſuch rapidity as it had done in France, nor did it rage with ſo much fury when it had caught; but this muſt be aſcribed to the nature of the materials, and not to any want of art or malice on the part of the incen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaries. The Americans are phlegmatic, ſlow to act; extremely cautious and difficult to be deceived. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſuch was the indefatigableneſs of the Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Clubs, that I venture to ſay, without running the riſk of contradiction, that more enmity to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Government was excited in the ſpace of ſix months, by the barefaced correſpondencies and reſolves of theſe clubs, than was excited againſt the colonial govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at the time of the declaration of Independence.</p>
            <p>The leading object was to ſtimulate the people to a cloſe imitation of the French Revolutioniſts, who had juſt then begun the career of pure unadulterated ſans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culottiſm. Every act or expreſſion that bore the marks of politeneſs or gentility ſoon began to be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030209_0021_0FF12C3A2F300460"/>
upon, to uſe their own words, as a ſort of <hi>leze republicaniſm.</hi> All the new fangled terms of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated French were introduced and made uſe of. The word <hi>citizen,</hi> that ſtalking horſe of modern li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty-men, became almoſt as common in America as in France. People, even people of ſenſe, began to accuſtom themſelves to be-citizen each other in as ſhameful a manner as the red-headed ruffians of the Fauxbourg St. Antoine.</p>
            <p>The news-printers were in ſome ſort the teachers of this new cant; and it was diverting enough ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to obſerve their embarraſſment in rendering the French political jargon into Engliſh. One of them having a wedding to announce, found himſelf at a ſtand when he came to the word <hi>citoyenne.</hi> Our good anceſtors had not foreſeen theſe days of equality, and had therefore never thought of a termination to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the <hi>feminine</hi> of a <hi>free-man.</hi> To ſay that <hi>citizen</hi> A. was married to <hi>citizen</hi> B. would have had a brutal ſound, even in the ears of a Jacobin, and therefore the ingenious news-man invented a termination, and his paragraph ran thus: <q>On — <hi>Citizen</hi> — was married to <hi>Citeſs</hi> — by <hi>Citizen</hi> —.<note n="*" place="bottom">This article is to be found in the <hi>Federal Gazette,</hi> for the year 1793.</note>

            <p>The <hi>citizens</hi> of France had juſt given ſignal proof of their patriotic valour, in making war upon the old buſts and ſtatues of their kings and nobles, and thoſe of America were determined not to be behind hand with them, as far as lay in their power. Lord Chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's ſtatue, erected by the people of Charleſton, South Carolina, as a mark of their eſteem for the part he took in pleading the cauſe of America, was drawn up into the air, by means of a jack and pullies, and abſolutely hanged, not till it was dead, but till the head ſeparated from the body. The ſtatue of Lord Bettertout, a piece of exquiſite workmanſhip, which ſtood in the town houſe of Williamſburgh in Virginia, was <hi>beheaded</hi> by the ſtudents of that place,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030209_0022_0FF12C7D319880B0"/>
and every mark of indignity, ſuch as ignoble minds can ſhow, was heaped on the reſemblance of a man, to whom the fathers of theſe ſtudents had yielded all poſſible teſtimony of love and eſteem.</p>
            <p>The rage for <hi>re-baptiſm,</hi> as the French call it, alſo ſpread very far. An alley at Boſton, called <hi>Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change Alley,</hi> and the ſtump of a tree, in the ſame town, which had borne the name of <hi>Royal,</hi> were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized with a vaſt deal of formality: the former was called <hi>Equality Lane,</hi> and the latter <hi>Liberty Stump.</hi> At New York the names of ſeveral ſtreets and places were changed; <hi>Queen Street</hi> became <hi>Pearl Street,</hi> and <hi>King Street, Liberty Street.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe who were unacquainted with the influence of the Democratic Clubs, were aſtoniſhed at theſe marks of political inſanity. Indeed, the follies of the French ſeemed to be wafted over the inſtant they had birth, and the different diſtricts ſeemed to vie with each other in adopting them. The delirium ſeized even the women and children; the former began to talk about liberty and equality in a good maſculine ſtyle: I have heard more than one young woman, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the age of twenty, declare that they would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly have dipped their hands in the blood of the Queen of France. A third part of the children, at leaſt, were decorated, like their wiſe ſires, in trico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored cockades. <hi>"Danſons la Carmagnole,"</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in a broken accent, was echoed through every ſtreet and every alley of Philadelphia, by both boys and girls. Some ingenious democratic poet had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the following lines:
<q>
                  <l>"Engliſhman no bon for me,</l>
                  <l>"Frenchman fight for liberty."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This diſtich, which at once ſhows the prevailing ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents, and exhibits an inſtance of that kind of jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon which was become faſhionable, was chanted about by young and old. Poor devils! thought I when I uſed to hear them, little do you know about liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:030209_0023_0FF12C7FB0F50CF0"/>Nor were marks of ferocity wanting. At a dinner at Philadelphia (at which <hi>a man high in office</hi> was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent) a <hi>roaſted pig</hi> became the repreſentative of Louis XVI. and it being the anniverſary of his murder, the pig's head was ſevered from his body, then carried round to each of the convives, who, after placing the liberty-cap upon his own head, pronounced the word <hi>tyrant,</hi> and gave the poor little grunter's head a chop with his knife.</p>
            <p>Never was the memory of any man ſo cruelly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted as that of this mild and humane monarch. He was guillotined in effigy, in the capital of the union, twenty or thirty times every day, during one whole winter, and part of the ſummer. Men, women, and children, flocked to this tragical exhibition, and not a ſingle paragraph appeared in the papers to ſhame them from it.—Much has been ſaid about the <hi>cruelty of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh ſports,</hi> and the <hi>humane</hi> French have now-and-then ſtigmatized them as barbarians, for the delight they take in ſeeing a pair of courageous animals ſpur each other to death; nay, the charge has been often repeated by Americans, and I muſt confeſs, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be ſaid in its defence; but I defy both French and Americans to bring me an inſtance of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty from the Engliſh ſports, that will bear a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the exhibition above mentioned.</p>
            <p>One cannot think of this exhibition without reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the honours that Louis formerly received on the ſame ſpot. On the triumphal arch that was erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Philadelphia, in 1783, was a buſt of Louis XVI, with this motto:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>MERENDO MEMORES FACIT.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>His Merit makes us remember him.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>On another part of the arch were the <hi>Three Lillies,</hi> the arms of France, with this motto:
<q>
                  <l>
                     <hi>GLORIAM SUPERANT.</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>They exceed in Glory.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:030209_0024_0FF12C8254701DE0"/>When a repreſentation of this Triumphal Arch was ſent to the King of France, what would he have done to one of his courtiers, who ſhould have ſaid to him: <q>Sire, be not too vain; depend not too much on the ſincerity of the Americans; for, ten years from this day, they will ſhake hands with your mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and on the very ſpot where this arch was erected, they will murder you in effigy; and theſe Lillies, now ſurpaſſing in glory, will they trample under foot.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is juſt, however, to obſerve, that a very great majority of the people of America, abhorred theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of a ſanguinary ſpirit; nor would it be going too far to aſſert, that two-thirds of the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats were foreigners, landed in the United States ſince the war. The charge that attaches to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in general, is, that theſe things were ſuffered to paſs unreproved. The friends of order and of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity were dilatory; like perſons of the ſame deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in France, they ſeemed to be waiting, till the ſons of equality came to cut their throats; and if they have finally eſcaped, it is to be aſcribed to mere chance, or to any thing, rather than to their own exertions.</p>
            <p>While the Democratic Societies were thus poiſoning the minds of the people, familiarizing them to inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and blood, Genet was not idle. He had ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded himſelf with a troop of horſe, enliſted and embodied in Philadelphia. Theſe were, in general, Frenchmen, and no one can doubt but they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to act, either on the offenſive or defenſive, as occaſion might require. This force rendered his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents bold; they threw off all reſerve, and iſſued their invitations to rebellion with an unſparing hand. The clubs at a diſtance followed the example, and, in ſome inſtances, improved upon it.</p>
            <p>As the Democrats increaſed in ſtrength and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, other men grew timid. No one ventured to whiſper his diſapprobation of the conduct of the
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030209_0025_0FF12C84D6CCD678"/>
French; every one, even of their moſt ſavage acts, was applauded: robbery and murder were called <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional juſtice</hi> in America as well as in France. The people, properly ſo called, were fairly cowed down, and things ſeemed as ripe for a revolution here, as they were in France, in the month of July, 1790.</p>
            <p>The country was ſaved from this dreadful ſcourge by the haſty indiſcretion of the Citizen Miniſter. The light-headed Frenchman was intoxicated with his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, and conceived that the moment was arrived for him to ſet the government at defiance, and call on the people for ſupport. But no ſooner had he expreſſed his intention of <q>appealing from the Preſident to the ſovereign people,</q> than he found he had been too ſanguine. He found that the <hi>people of America</hi> were yet more attached to General Waſhington than to the French Miniſter or the French nation. Their love and veneration for their old and tried friend ſeemed to be revived by this inſult; and though the Democratic Clubs defended the conduct of their founder, they found themſelves too weak to take any decided ſtep in his favour.</p>
            <p>When Genet diſcovered that he had been too raſh, he ſtrove to recover himſelf by denying that he had threatened the government with an appeal to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and his friend <hi>Dallas,</hi> who, as Secretary of the State of Pennſylvania, had been the bearer of the threat, was prevailed on to deny that it was made. <hi>Dallas</hi> publiſhed an explanation of his contradictory account of the matter, endeavouring to exculpate both the Frenchman and himſelf; but this explanation had no other effect than that which a lie added to an offence never fails to produce.</p>
            <p>From this time forward the clubs were a little more cautious in their reſolves. When they met it was by night, and <hi>under lock and key.</hi> Genet became timid, attempted to juſtify himſelf, and ſeemed to tremble for his fate. He ſaw that his reſources decreaſed, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030209_0026_0FF12C888EAA68E8"/>
that the remainder would be wanted for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes than that of nouriſhing a neſt of hungry Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats. The vital principle being extinct, the body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to dwindle: the old leaders ſkulked off one by one, and at laſt none remained but the mere tools.</p>
            <p>Among theſe were the Democrats from England, a ſet of mortals whoſe ſtupidity is equalled by their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, and by that alone. They, poor devils, who had never been ſuffered even to ſmell the loaves and fiſhes, perſevered with as good heart as ever, after the feaſt was all over; and wondered why others abated in their zeal. Engliſhmen are ſaid to be changeable and fickle minded; but when foreigners lay this to our charge, they ſhould make an exception of one caſe, and that is, <hi>when we are in the wrong.</hi> No men on earth abandon their errors with ſo much reluctance as the inhabitants on the ſouth of the Tweed.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Pearce,</hi> who had had the honour to be a dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate to the <hi>London Correſponding Society,</hi> and who, on that account, was admitted a member of the Jacobin club of Philadelphia, propoſed a <hi>negro man</hi> as worthy of a ſeat. Pearce was a philanthropiſt, a true equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity man, a diſciple of Wincheſter. He was ſilly enough to ſuppoſe that the Democrats were really what they profeſſed to be, and therefore he foreſaw no kind of oppoſition to the introduction of his char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal-faced friend, and having an extraordinary degree of zeal for the increaſe of the ſociety, took the earlieſt opportunity to propoſe him. The club being met and the doors locked, he roſe in all the pride of conſcious ſans-culottiſm, and propoſed brother Pompey as a member; but he ſoon found that the American Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats did not carry their ideas of equality quite ſo far as he did. "No, no, no," reſounded from every quarter, and when the votes came to be taken, there appeared but two or three, out of about fifty, in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the admiſſion; and thus Pompey, whom Pearce deſcribes as a d—d honeſt fellow, eſcaped inevitable corruption and diſgrace.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:030209_0027_0FF12C8CA9ED5660"/>This refuſal, however, loſt them the Delegate: he told them, that he had joined the club in the perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that it was compoſed of pure Democrats, and that his conſcience would not permit him to remain among them a moment, after what he had been a witneſs of that night.</p>
            <p>The buſineſs of the clubs was reduced to trifling diſcuſſions of this ſort, when the recall of Genet ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to forebode their total extinction. Genet's inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence had produced a complaint on the part of the American Government, and this complaint had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his recal. The corner ſtone of the Jacobin af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filiation being removed, every one expected the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure to fall to the ground; how deceitful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances were we ſhall ſee by-and-by, after having made a remark or two on this act of <q>friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion,</q> as it has been termed, of the French uſurpers.</p>
            <p>Firſt, it muſt be remembered, that at the time the complaint was made, the faction, by whom Genet had been ſent out, were hurled from their thrones, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had got poſſeſſion of them. Robeſpierre and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat were glad of having an opportunity to accuſe their rivals of having offended the American Government, and to take to themſelves the credit of healing the wound. Diſplacing Genet inſtantly, upon application, was a ſtep, too, which they knew would render them popular in America, and ſilence thoſe who began to arraign the conduct of the Convention. Thus, by the means of this "condeſcenſion," they ſecured to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves three advantages: it furniſhed them with one more crime to heap on the heads of their rival faction; they completely ſupplanted that faction in the partiality of the people of the United States; and, which was of ſtill greater importance, they purſued the ſame treacherous manoeuvres, without being ſuſpected. Theſe were the motives of this act of <q>friendly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:030209_0028_0FF12C9080B050B8"/>That they did not, in their hearts, diſapprove of the proceedings of Genet, is clear from their ſuffering him to remain in the United States. When did they forgive thoſe who offended them? Had they demanded him, the government muſt, and, they knew, would, have given him up; but no ſuch demand was ever made, and this circumſtance alone ſufficiently proves, that, had he ſucceeded, a <hi>civic crown</hi> would have been the mede of his machinations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fauchet,</hi> the ſucceſſor of Genet, trod exactly in his ſteps, but with a little more caution. The Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Clubs made not the leaſt heſitation in transferring their obedience from one miniſter to the other. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, all the diſciples of the new-light philoſophy are made of the ſame commodious kind of ſtuff. All that they do is, to aſk who directs the ſtorm of anarchy, and they inſtantly become his ardent admirers, if not his tools. In this reſpect no ſet of beings, I cannot call them men, ever approached ſo near to the herd of Paris, as did the Democrats of America. One day ſaw the faction of Briſſot exalted to the ſkies, and the very next, ſaw the ſame compliments, the very ſame turgid effuſions of patriotic admiration, heaped on their murderers. From the firſt aſſembling of the States General to this very hour, every leader, while he continued ſuch, has been the god of thoſe wretches who now-a-days ſtyle themſelves patriots. I have now a bundle of gazettes before me, publiſhed all by the ſame man, wherein Mirabeau, Fayette, Briſſot, Danton, and Robeſpierre, are all panegyrized and execrated in due ſucceſſion; nor do I yet deſpair of living to ſee Talien and Louvet added to the liſt. The verſatile mob of Paris, who firſt canonized Mirabeau and Voltaire, and afterwards ſcattered their remains to the winds; and who, after having given Marat's ugly carcaſs a place in their temple of fame, and his name to a city, dug him up, put his aſhes into a chamber-pot, by way of urn, and then threw them into the common ſewer; this verſatile, ſtupid and venal mob, does not ſurpaſs in either quality, the Democratic news-printers in the
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030209_0029_0FF12C9417E25D58"/>
United States of America; and ſorry am I to ſay, that they are not few in number. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>At the head of theſe we may venture to place <hi>Benjamin Franklin Bache,</hi> a grand-ſon (whether in a <hi>ſtraight or crooked line,</hi> I know not) of Old Doctor Franklin. This is the man whom the doctor left his books and printing-office to, and good uſe has he made of them. The hiſtory of the types of this office would be an amuſing performance: it would be curious to trace them from the oppoſition of the Britiſh Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial government to as determined an oppoſition againſt the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment raiſed on its ruins; from the old ſaws of hypocritical moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, contained in the pages of <hi>Poor Richard's</hi> Almanac, to the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous nonſenſe of the French Republican Calendar.

            <p>A circumſtance that ſtrongly ſeconded the endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of <hi>Fauchet</hi> and the Clubs, was, the diſcontents that exiſted among the people of the Weſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Pennſylvania, on account of the exciſe on whiſky. Theſe diſcontents were, in ſome meaſure, done away, or, at leaſt, they produced no ſerious conſequences, before the inſtitution of the Democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Societies: with this inſtitution they revived, and aſſumed a more determined aſpect: the malcontents
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030209_0030_0FF12C968C2004E8"/>
had now a rallying point; by means of the affiliation they communicated their pretended grievances to every corner of the Union, from whence they inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived aſſurances of aid and ſupport of the clubs. Thus encouraged, they proceeded from one exceſs to another, till, at laſt, ſeveral counties were officially declared to be in a ſtate of actual inſurrection.</p>
            <p>To give a detailed account of this inſurrection, were it conſiſtent with my circumſcribed plan, would be of little uſe. That <hi>fifteen thouſand</hi> men were obliged to quit their homes and buſineſs, to encounter a campaign of uncommon hardſhip and toil; that many of theſe peaceable, orderly citizens (citizens in the true ſenſe of the word) loſt their lives in conſequence of the fatigues they underwent, leaving their aſhes to be trod on by the vile inſurgents; that the expenſes of the armament to a million and a half of dollars, are to be deducted from the fruits of induſtry; theſe are well known, and will be long remembered facts, and therefore need no hiſtorian. It is to the influence that the Democratic Clubs had in producing the inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and its conſequent calamities, that I wiſh to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the reader's attention.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the Club at Philadelphia was formed, ſimilar ones were formed in the Weſtern Counties, compoſed entirely of men, who were not only oppoſed to the exciſe law, but to the government which had enacted it. Meſſengers and emiſſaries paſſed continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally between the clubs in the Eaſt and thoſe in the Weſt. From this time the <hi>reſolves</hi> of the malcontents aſſumed another tone. Theſe refractory people had hitherto confined their demands to a repeal of the exciſe law; but they now talked of forcing the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to open the navigation of the Miſſiſſippi, and complained, in the ſtyle of Genet and the Clubs, againſt the Proclamation of Neutrality, and, in ſhort, againſt the whole of the conduct of the Federal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="unknown:030209_0031_0FF12C9959CEEF00"/>Let any one read their <hi>toaſts</hi> and <hi>reſolves,</hi> and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their manner of proceeding, and compare theſe with thoſe of the Democratic Societies; and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, if he can, that they were not both actuated with the ſame ſpirit, and had not the ſame objects in view; namely, a war with Britain, and the deſtruction of the General Government. During two years had the Weſtern complaints exiſted: the complainants had often aſſembled, and had paſſed reſolves without number about their deteſtable drink; but never till now did they join their cauſe to that of France: ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver till now did they wear national cockades, or rally under the <hi>tree of liberty</hi> mounted with a bloody Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſian cap. Will any man in his ſenſes believe that theſe were mere whims, freaks of fancy, that came athwart their brains by chance, without the leaſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or prior inſtruction from their friends in the Eaſt?</p>
            <p>Let us hear our old friend <hi>Citizen Fauchet's</hi> opinion on this ſubject. In giving his maſters an account of the breaking out of the inſurrection, he ſays: <q>In the mean time <hi>popular ſocieties are formed;</hi> politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ideas concentre themſelves; the <hi>patriotic party unite</hi> and more cloſely connect themſelves, &amp;c.</q>— Then, after giving them a deſcription of the Weſtern people and the nature of their drink, &amp;c. he adds: <q>Now, as the common diſpatches inform you, theſe complaints <hi>were ſyſtematizing</hi> by the <hi>converſations of influential men, who retired into theſe wild coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> and who, from <hi>principle,</hi> or by a ſeries of <hi>particular heart-burnings, animated diſcontents</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy near efferveſcence. At laſt, the <hi>local exploſion is effected.</hi> The Weſtern people calculated on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſupported by <hi>ſome diſtinguiſhed characters in the Eaſt,</hi> and even imagined they had in the boſom of the government ſome abettors, who might ſhare in their grievances or their principles.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not attempt to point out theſe <hi>diſtinguiſhed characters in the Eaſt;</hi> but let the reader recollect that <hi>Mr. Dallas</hi> was one in the leaders of the Mother,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:030209_0032_0FF12C9DAAD07AD0"/>
and then let him read the following extract from ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of <hi>Fauchet's Letter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>Of all the governors, whoſe duty it was to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear at the head of the requiſitions, <hi>the governor of Pennſylvania</hi> alone enjoyed <hi>the name of Republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can;</hi> his opinion of the Secretary of the Treaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and of his ſyſtems was known to be unfavourable. The <hi>ſecretary of this ſtate poſſeſſed great influence in the Popular Society of Philadelphia,</hi> which in its turn influenced thoſe of other ſtates; of courſe he merited attention. It appears therefore that theſe men, with others unknown to me, all having without doubt Randolph at their head, were ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancing to decide on their party. Two or three days before the proclamation was publiſhed, and of courſe before the cabinet had reſolved on its mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Mr. Randolph came to ſee me with an air of great eagerneſs, and made to me the overtures, of which I have given you an account in my No. 6. Thus, with ſome thouſands of dollars, the Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic could have decided on civil war or on peace! Thus the conſciences of the pretended patriots of America have already their prices! It is very true that the certainty of theſe concluſions, painful to be drawn, will for ever exiſt in our archives! What will be the old age of this government, if it is thus early decrepid!</q>
            </p>
            <p>From the conduct of the democrats prior to the breaking out of the inſurrection, we naturally come to that which they obſerved ſubſequent to that event; and here we ſhall find nothing but what tends to ſtrengthen the charge againſt them. Immediately upon the iſſuing of the Preſident's proclamation, all the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers devoted to the French Miniſter and his clubs, and particularly <hi>Bache's,</hi> which might be looked upon as the mirror of their ſentiments, attacked, with all their malice, both thoſe who iſſued, and thoſe who were ready to obey it. Every art was uſed to inſtil into the minds of the militia, that they were called on to cut the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:030209_0033_0FF12CA03581A5A8"/>
throats of their fellow citizens merely to ſupport the rich creditors of the State; and, of courſe, that they ought not to obey the ſummons to attend. <q>As vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means,</q> (ſays Bache's paper of the 20th of Auguſt) <q>As <hi>violent means</hi> appear the deſire of high-toned government men, it is to be hoped that thoſe who derive the moſt benefit from our revenue laws, will be the foremoſt to march againſt the Weſtern Inſurgents. Let ſtock-holders, bank directors, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators, and revenue officers arrange themſelves immediately <hi>under the banners of the treaſury,</hi> and try their proweſs in arms, as they have done in cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation. The prompt recourſe to hoſtilities will no doubt operate upon the <hi>knights</hi> of our country to appear in military array, and then the <hi>poor but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious citizen</hi> will not be <hi>obliged to ſpill the blood of his fellow citizen to gratify certain reſentments,</hi> and expoſe himſelf to the loſs of life and of limb to <hi>ſupport a funding order.</hi>
               </q> In the ſame paper of the 26th of Auguſt: <q>The diſcontents which have taken place in the Weſtern Counties, and which have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the form of open hoſtility to law, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the diſſatisfactions that are to be found in every part of the continent, may be readily accounted for, by a reference to the proceedings of our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>from its birth.</hi> The bantling fancied itſelf <hi>ſomething royal,</hi> before it was able to ſtand alone, and ſince it has been progreſſing towards manhood, the State dignity, ſuperciliouſneſs and manners of a monarch have characterized its actions. To ſupport itſelf in royal pomp, aroſe the funding and banking ſyſtems, <hi>exciſes,</hi> &amp;c. Nothing but coronets and ſtars are wanting, to the ſtockholders. Is this a land of liberty? Is this a land where citizens are <hi>equal? It would be no wonder</hi> if every citizen, who is not immediately intereſted in the funding ſyſtem, <hi>ſhould riſe up,</hi> and with one word <hi>exclaim againſt its iniquity,</hi>
               </q> or, in other words, <hi>join the inſurgents.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such was the language of the democrats, at the very moment that the inſurrection wore the moſt threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:030209_0034_0FF12CA26C6A8B60"/>
aſpect, and ſuch was the effect it had on ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of the people, that it was with the utmoſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty a ſufficient number of men were collected to make up the quota of the State of Pennſylvania.</p>
            <p>Mr. Findley, the ingenious hiſtorian of the Weſtern Inſurrection, and a principal actor in it, inſiſts, with a <hi>modeſty</hi> becoming his country, that the inſurrection ought to be attributed entirely to the irritable <hi>heat of the weather,</hi> during the dog-days of 1794; and, of courſe he wiſhes us to believe, that it was quelled by the returning coolneſs of October and November. It muſt be confeſſed that the inſurgents were afflicted with a ſort of canine malady, for they ſnapped at the hand that yielded them protection; but, I believe, few peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, after what has been ſaid above, will not remain well convinced, that the inſurrection was fomented by democratic fuel, paid for with French Gold; and that it was cooled again by the approach of General Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, at the head of fifteen thouſand men.</p>
            <p>For the ſake of preſerving connection, ſome ſtriking traits of ſans-culottiſm, which took place prior to the epoch at which we are now arrived, have been omitted; but they are too characteriſtic of the ſect whoſe hiſtory I am writing, to paſs altogether unnoticed.</p>
            <p>As I have more than once obſerved, that the Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crats aped the regenerated French in all their follies, and in all their crimes as far as they were able, it will be underſtood, that they made a boaſt of being atheiſts or deiſts as the Convention changed its creed. When the faction of Danton ſeemed to preponderate, and members exclaimed againſt the "ariſtocracy of heaven;" when the infamous <hi>Dupont</hi> exclaimed: <q>Oh! ſhame, Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators of the Univerſe! You have hurled down the thrones of kings, and you yet ſuffer the altars of God to remain!</q> Then the Democrats made an open profeſſion of Atheiſm. But when <hi>Robeſpierre</hi> obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the aſcendency, and ordered the Convention <hi>to decree,</hi> that there was a <hi>Supreme Being</hi> (Etre Supreme); then
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:030209_0035_0FF12CA6E09DF9C0"/>
did our good ſans-culottes burn incenſe on the altars of deiſm, with as much devotion as the ragged groups of <hi>St. Marceau</hi> and the whores and bullies of the <hi>Palais de L'Egalite.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been often obſerved, that, however widely atheiſm and deiſm may differ in theory, in practice, that is in their effects, they are nearly the ſame. So it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens now; for, whether they profeſſed the opinions of Danton or thoſe of his bloody ſucceſſor, they ſtill teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame hatred of the Chriſtian Religion, and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, with every inſult they durſt offer, all thoſe who had courage enough to ſtand forward in its defence.</p>
            <p>The firſt aſſault of this kind was on the Reverend Mr. Abercrombie of the Epiſcopal Church, Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia. This gentleman had preached a ſermon, warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his congregation againſt the contagion of French atheiſm and deiſm. For this inſtance of becoming zeal in the diſcharge of the moſt imperious of all duties, he was attacked in the public papers; accuſed of <hi>bigotry,</hi> of being <hi>an enemy to the cauſe of liberty,</hi> and of the <hi>French people.</hi> There was not a worthy man in the city, who did not feel an indignation againſt the authors of this unprovoked calumny, and who did not regret, that the injured clergyman ſhould ſee the neceſſity of anſwering it. Dreadful times indeed are thoſe, when the ſervants of the Lord are brought to the bar of the public, for daring to obey the commands of their maſter! For daring to defend him againſt thoſe, who brand him with the name of cheat and impoſtor! <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>About the ſame time that this inſult was offered to Mr. Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crombie, a paragraph appeared in the Philadelphia Gazette, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by one Brown, containing a liſt of eminent men, who had ariſen on "the democratic floor," and concluding with, <hi>Marat, St. Paul,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have mentioned this ſcandalous paragraph in ſo many places, that I ſhould not have done it here, had not its exiſtence been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied in a pamphlet lately publiſhed by a Scotch run-away, whoſe name is <hi>Calender,</hi> and who was, it ſeems, the editor of the gazette at the time. The paragraph appeared in the paper above-mentioned, on the 20th of June, in the memorable 1794.</p>
               </note>

            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:030209_0036_0FF161CD1182A698"/>This pulpit eveſdropping having, in ſome meaſure ſucceeded, they caſt their ſcrutinizing ſcowling eyes over the out-ſide of the church. Here they found a ſmall wooden buſt of George II. This buſt, like the <hi>Old Stump</hi> at Boſton, had remained very quiet during the American revolution; but could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the fiery ordeal of the French revolution. Trifling circumſtances like theſe ſhow the difference in the influence which theſe revolutions have had on men's minds, in a ſtronger light than the moſt important events can do, and prove what I have always aſſerted; namely, that the moderation which marked the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can character in the laſt revolution, muſt not be count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, ſhould another take place.</p>
            <p>The diſcovery of the buſt was no ſooner made, than the Democrats formed the reſolution of deſtroying it; or, in the language of <hi>Gregoire,</hi> of committing an act of <hi>vandaliſm.</hi> They accordingly publiſhed the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing card, as they called it, in their printer Bache's gazette of the 21ſt July, 1794.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

            <p>One is at a loſs which to admire moſt, the logic, the impudence, or the hypocriſy of this intimation. How exactly, too, does it imitate the ſtyle of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention;
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:030209_0037_0FF161D1105653C8"/>
"<hi>young</hi> and <hi>virtuous men!</hi>" Canting raſcals! How willingly would you have led thoſe <hi>young</hi> and <hi>virtuous men</hi> to cut the throats of their fathers and mothers, and of the miniſters to whom they were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached!</p>
            <p>In conſequence of the democratic <hi>card,</hi> which was rightly looked upon as a threat, a veſtry was called, and it was thought more adviſeable to abandon the buſt to the fury of the <hi>vandals,</hi> than to expoſe the church itſelf to danger. Accordingly, the <hi>barbarians</hi> aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with ladders, mallets and chiſſels. The crown and the projecting part of the buſt were chipped off; but the profile, with G on one ſide of it and II. on the other, are ſtill as conſpicuous as ever. All that the Democrats effected, was, a change in the ideas awakened by the ſight of the buſt. From a monument of well-placed eſteem and gratitude, it is become a monument of democratic folly and baſeneſs and ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and undiſtinguiſhing revenge.</p>
            <p>It was eaſy to perceive, that they did not mean to ſtop here, and therefore few people were ſurpriſed at their next pointing out the propriety of taking the <hi>mitre</hi> from the ſteeple.<note n="*" place="bottom">See Bache's gazette of the 21ſt Auguſt, 1794.</note> This demand was not made in ſuch direct and poſitive terms, and therefore it was not complied with; but there is little doubt but both mitre and church would have had a tumble long ago, had not the Weſtern Inſurrection excited a general hatred againſt the clubs, and thus rendered them leſs daring and inſolent.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time that we are recording the violences of the clubs againſt Chriſtian inſtitutions, truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that we ſhould confeſs, that but too many of the clergy appeared either contaminated with French principles, or cowardly enough not to attempt an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to their progreſs. All that can be ſaid in the defence of ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, is, that they feared to offend
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030209_0038_0FF161D3D18A9DA8"/>
their congregations, on whom they were totally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent for ſupport. This is ſurely a very weak de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; but, I am afraid, it is one that muſt often be made, where the paſtor is removable at the pleaſure of his flock.</p>
            <p>But, there were others who were not merely paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; who were not aſhamed to mingle in the baccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalian orgies of the civic feſtivals, held to celebrate the ſucceſſes of atheiſts over the religion of which they profeſſed to be believers, and of which they were teachers. Among theſe the <hi>Reverend Citizen Prentiſs,</hi> of Reading, Maſſachuſetts, and the <hi>Reverend Citizen Doctor M'Knight,</hi> of New York, claim the ſcandalous pre-eminence.</p>
            <p>Nor were the places dedicated to the inſtruction of youth ſecurely guarded againſt the approaches of ſans-culottiſm. Of this the conduct of Doctor Rogers, a teacher in the Univerſity at Philadelphia, exhibits a ſtriking proof. He gave the boys of his claſs a ſpeech out of Shakeſpeare's Harry V. to get by heart. It was the king's animating addreſs to his army before Harfleur: "Once more to the breach, dear friends," &amp;c. which, in Shakeſpeare ends thus:
<q>
                  <l>"Follow your ſpirit, and, upon this charge,</l>
                  <l>"Cry—God for Harry! England! and St. George!"</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This concluſion the Doctor parodied:
<q>"Cry—God for <hi>Freedom! France!</hi> and <hi>Robeſpierre!"</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>All the claſs repeated it with the democratic emen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, except a little Engliſh boy about ten or eleven years of age, who boldly ſaid:
<q>"Cry—God for <hi>Harry! England!</hi> and <hi>St. George!</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nor could he be prevailed upon to alter the text. This brave little fellow's name is Whitlock, who,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:030209_0039_0FF161D693E5B060"/>
though a child, certainly poſſeſſed more taſte, more ſenſe, more patriotiſm and more piety than his Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend teacher.</p>
            <p>When the ſweet Warwickſhire bard put this noble ſpeech into the mouth of his favourite hero, he was not bleſſed with the hope, that, hundreds of years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, and thouſands of miles diſtant, it would call forth ſuch a noble ſpirit in a child of ten years of age.</p>
            <p>Before I return to take my leave of the Democratic Societies, I truſt the reader will not be diſpleaſed with an account of the civic <hi>fete</hi> of the 23d <hi>Thermidor</hi> (10th of Auguſt, "ſtyle of the ſlaves"), which was celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at Philadelphia in 1794.</p>
            <p>To ward off every charge of miſrepreſentation, I ſhall confine myſelf to a literal tranſlation of the <hi>Proces Verbal</hi> (Minutes of the proceedings), ſent to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, and which may be ſeen in the French Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia gazette of the 25th <hi>Thermidor,</hi> 12th of Auguſt, "ſtyle of the ſlaves," as the <hi>humane</hi> French Governor of Gaudaloupe calls it.</p>
            <q>
               <p>At ſun-riſe the <hi>fete</hi> was announced by a <hi>ſalve</hi> of 22 guns, in alluſion to the 22d of Sept.—At eight o'clock another <hi>ſalve</hi> of 10 guns, at once announced the <hi>fete</hi> of the 10th Auguſt, and the hour of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling.</p>

               <p>A deputation of French citizens then went to the French Miniſter's where the <hi>chiefs civil and military of the State of Pennſylvania</hi> were aſſembled. A deputy announced to the miniſter that the good people were waiting for their <hi>repreſentatives.</hi> They immediately came to the ſquare preceded by the flags of the two nations, marching to the noiſe of drums and cannons, and amidſt the cries, a hundred times repeated, of <hi>Vive la Republique Françoiſe!</hi> [I will not diſgrace our language by tranſlating the vile accla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation]; and war-like muſic played, by intervals, airs analogous to the tranſports which burſt forth from every quarter.</p>
               <p>When every thing was ready, ten guns were fired as a ſignal for the march. Two pieces of cannon, followed by French and American cannoneers, took the lead. The hatred that we were going to ſwear againſt tyrants, was written on every countenance. The anniverſary of the deſtruction of deſpotiſm painted on every face patriotiſm, liberty, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</p>
               <p>The <hi>obeliſk was carried by four citizens,</hi> two French and two American, in red liberty caps: theſe were followed by a French grenadier, bearing a <hi>pike</hi> ſurmounted with a liberty cap.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Now comes the prettieſt part of the proceſſion.</p>
            <q>
               <p>Twelve young <hi>cîtoyennes</hi> (or ſhe citizens), dreſſed in pure white, adorned with civic crowns and ceſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes tricolor, each bearing a little baſket of flowers, ſurrounded the obeliſk.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:030209_0041_0FF161D9E4AA2F48"/>What a contraſt there was between theſe little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent lambs, with their flower-baſkets, and the ſwarthy grenadier with his bloody pike and cap!</p>
            <q>
               <p>The French Miniſter, the Conſuls, the <hi>chiefs civil and military of Pennſylvania,</hi> marched in the centre of the proceſſion.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Indeed it was diverting enough to ſee theſe great perſonages, the good ſober-looking, pot-bellied chiefs of Pennſylvania, come ſqueezing, and ſhouldering, and zigzaging along, like ſo many raw recruits at drill. They were formed into what military men call a pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toon, and never did my eyes behold ſo awkward a ſquad.</p>
            <p>There is a ſmall omiſſion in this part of the <hi>Proces Verbal,</hi> which I ſhall ſupply.—Before the proceſſion left the centre ſquare, the <hi>Engliſh flag,</hi> which had been brought thither <hi>reverſed,</hi> under the flags of France and America, was <hi>burnt</hi> before the obeliſk, amidſt the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant hootings of the brave ſons of liberty and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.—This was by way of retaliation for Lord Howe's victory over the ſans-culotte fleet, the news of which had arrived the day before.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The proceſſion advanced to the garden of the Miniſter François, where there was an altar erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the country, on which ſtood the goddeſs of liberty. The flags of the two nations were planted on each ſide of her, while the little ſhe citizens were ranged round the altar.</p>
               <p>Patriotic hymns were now ſung, accompanied with muſic; and while the moſt tender and melting invocations were put up, the ſhe citizens made to the goddeſs a ſweet ſmelling offering of the flowers they had brought, with which they covered her altar, with an innocent zeal peculiar to their age.</p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="unknown:030209_0042_0FF161E00CA42138"/>The patriotic hymns being ended, an oration was made by a Citizen François, <note n="*" place="bottom">It is well worthy of remark, that this oration, which was ſent to the convention, contained a high ſtrained compliment to <hi>Robeſpierre,</hi> juſt at the very time that the convention and their mob were hacking and ſhooting and guillotining him.—Had the <hi>virtuous civic feters</hi> known this, they would have curſed him moſt heartily; as, indeed, they did two months afterwards. —What a pity it is, that there is no means by which our ſans-culottes can come at the exact ſtate of things in France at the moment they are framing their toaſts and reſolves!</note> and then the Miniſter François made another, and then the whole ſwore to be faithful to the Republic. The beſt of this was, three-fourths of the audience did not underſtand a word of what they heard, of what they ſwore to, or even of the oath they took.</p>
            <q>
               <p>The Miniſter had hardly time to conclude, when the cries [or howlings] of <hi>Vive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> Republique Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çois une et indiviſible!</hi> burſt forth from every throat.</p>
               <p>A diſcharge of cannon, a war-like march, and a roll of the drums, expreſſed the joy of the people, and ſignified that every heart was glad.—Inſtantly the ranks broke off, and dances were formed round the altar of liberty, and over all the encloſure.</p>
            </q>
            <p>Theſe dances were the fineſt fun I ever enjoyed. The patriotic hymns were well enough; four hundred fellows howling out French bombaſt, without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a word of it, was not a bad ſpecimen of fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal diſſonance; but to behold fifty or ſixty groupes, promiſcouſly formed, whiſtling, ſinging and capering about they knew not why nor wherefore; and to ſee the <hi>"chiefs civil and military of Pennſylvania,"</hi> heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their legs, and endeavouring to ape the light-heeled mounſeers, was a ſpectacle which, I truſt, has been ſeldom equalled.—In one part of the garden you heard the chorus of the bloody
<q>
                  <l>Ah! ça ira, ça ira, ça ira,</l>
                  <l>Les Ariſtocrats a la Lanterne.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:030209_0043_0FF161E1AA5E8308"/>In another:
<q>
                  <l>Danſons la carmagnole,</l>
                  <l>Vive le ſon, vive le ſon</l>
                  <l>Du canon.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>While in another,
<q>Alons enfans de la patrie</q>
ſeemed to iſſue from the lungs of twenty infernals. But what was ſtill moſt ludicrous, was, to hear all this uttered, by the greateſt part of the chanters, in an accent barbarous beyond deſcription. But, to proceed with my tranſlation:</p>
            <p>
               <q>During the reſt of the day, public joy was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted all over the city.</q>—That's a lie. One half of the people of the city cared nothing at all about the <hi>fete,</hi> and were aſtoniſhed and aſhamed that the cannons of the ſtate ſhould be employed on ſuch an occaſion; and I venture to affirm, that not one-twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth part of thoſe who aſſiſted at it, would have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, had they known they were celebrating the anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary of the fall of Louis XVI. and the horrid and cowardly murder of the Swiſs guards. This remark juſtice demanded in defence of thoſe who attended through ignorance. With regard to the <q>chiefs, civil and military of Pennſylvania,</q> as I have too much reſpect for them to accuſe them of ignorance, I leave them to defend themſelves.</p>
            <p>We muſt now return to the Democratic Clubs. In what remains to be ſaid of them I ſhall be very conciſe.</p>
            <p>Though they were inſtituted for the expreſs purpoſe of clogging the wheels of government, weakening its power, and exciting a ſpirit of diſcontent among the people, that might acquire ſtrength enough to force it into a war on the ſide of France, or totally annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it; yet there were three meaſures in this continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed oppoſition, againſt which the Democrats made a
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:030209_0044_0FF161E467DC44F8"/>
bolder ſtand than uſual, and called forth more than ordinary exertions; namely, the <hi>Proclamation</hi> of <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality,</hi> the enforcing obedience to the <hi>Exciſe-Law,</hi> and the ſanctioning of the <hi>Britiſh Treaty.</hi> They had entered their ſolemn proteſt againſt the two former, and had uſed every means in their power to effect a forcible, and even an armed oppoſition to them; and their conduct with reſpect to the latter was exactly of the ſame deſcription. But, of every part of this conduct, their reſolves againſt the appointment of the man beſt calculated to bring about an accommodation; their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing the treaty in a mutilated form with their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidious miſrepreſentations; their diſpatching runners to all the principal towns, to exaſperate the diſcontented, and deceive the weak; their diſhonourable means of obtaining petitions to Congreſs againſt it; the intrigues of Randolph and Fauchet, and the embarraſſment and alarm their machinations ſpread through the country; all theſe are ſo freſh in every one's memory, that it is uſeleſs to dwell on them here. Certain it is that they ought not to be forgotten, nor will they be, while <hi>Peter Porcupine's</hi> writings are remembered; and though theſe latter are aſſuredly not deſtined to long life, I hope they will outlive the infernal ſect of the Jacobins, and if this hope be to be realized, I ſincerely wiſh they may ſink into oblivion to-morrow.</p>
            <p>The Weſtern Inſurrection and its effects had already rendered the Democrats extremely odious; here their miſchievous efforts touched the pockets and the lives of the people; and their failure in the laſt attempt to trouble the peace of the Union, obliged them to hide their heads. The dark caballing clubs do, indeed, ſtill exiſt; but they either never meet, or they dare not publiſh their reſolves. However, let not the friends of the General Government, of order, of peace and of general happineſs and proſperity, imagine that the ſect is annihilated. They only wait for a more favourable moment, and ſhould the indiſcretion or ſupineneſs of the ſound part of the community ſuffer that moment to
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:030209_0045_0FF161E60D5ECA60"/>
arrive, they will obtain an aſcendency that will enable them to inflict ſignal vengeance for their paſt diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments. From their reign God defend me and mine!</p>
            <p>From one juſtified by his talents in being anxious about his reputation as a writer, the imperfectneſs of this ſketch would require an apology. As this is not my caſe, I ſhall make none. However, as publiſher of the hiſtory of Jacobiniſm, I hope I can promiſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that the ſatisfaction the reader will derive from the book itſelf, will induce him to excuſe the faults of the Appendix.</p>
