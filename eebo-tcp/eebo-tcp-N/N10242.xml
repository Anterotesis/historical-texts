         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I Do not mean to thee, that haſt only the name <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou haſt been born in a nation called ſo, or becauſe thy parents were ſo, and thou haſt walked in their traditions, and made profeſſion of that which is reputed the <hi>Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> Neither do I mean thou, that art the ſon, daughter, ſervant, or hand-maid of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> indeed; who haſt been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated and inſtructed in the principles of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> not only by precept, but by example; and haſt, in honour and reſpect of thy parents or maſter, yielded obedience ſo far, as to walk in ſome meaſure in the form thereof, out of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity of naughtineſs that is in the world; which is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable in its place, time and ſeaſon: Yet thou art not the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> I here intend. But thou art the man or woman, who haſt known ſomething of the work and power of God in or upon thy mind, and art in ſome meaſure quicked and made alive thereby, haſt been made ſenſible of thy ſore bondage and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and haſt cries and breathings begotten in thee for deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, under the ſenſe of thy ſad ſtate and condition without a Saviour. Thou, to whom ſin hath been a grievous burthen, with which thou haſt been weary and heavy laden. Thou to whom ſin is made exceeding ſinful, ſo that thou hateſt it, even as God hates it, <hi>viz. becauſe it is ſin;</hi> and art in love with right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, purity and holineſs, having felt the drawings of the Father to the Son thy Saviour; and thou art now in him, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing hard to be wholly freed from the one, and to become a ſervant, child and friend of the other.</p>
               <p>Thou art the <hi>Chriſtian Reader</hi> my bowels yearn towards, my care is for, and my advice is to, that thou mayeſt perſevere to the end, and eſcape all the dangers in the way; that thou mayeſt be acquainted with the wiles of the enemy, and with his myſterious working againſt thee, even after the ſtrong man is bound, his goods ſpoiled, and thy houſe ſwept and garniſhed; after thou haſt clean eſcaped the pollutions of the world, and the errors therein, and haſt had much experience of the power and preſence of the Lord; even after he hath brought thee into his vineyard, into his garden, and made thee a dreſſer and keeper of it, if thou wilt receive and keep the <hi>penny</hi> (the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) thou muſt be diligent and watchful therein. Remember, the ſerpent came into Paradiſe to deceive, and that ſatan came
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:013006_0003_0F8FAAE7EA15C208"/>before God, to accuſe and ſtir him up againſt the righteous, and that the great red dragon got into Heaven; and not only ſo, <hi>but made war there, and ſtood before the woman which was ready to be delivered, to devour the child as ſoon as it was born.</hi> And when he was overcome in Heaven, and caſt into the earth and ſea, and among the inhabitants thereof, he ceaſed not to be wroth with the woman, and to <hi>make war with the remnant of her ſeed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus.</hi> Read <hi>Rev.</hi> xii. This hath been his work of old, and is the ſame at this day.</p>
               <p>Seeing Paradiſe, the preſence of God and Heaven, are not exempted from the approaches of the ſerpent, ſatan and dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon; what great need there is for thee to be always armed againſt him, and to keep a watchful eye over him, eſpecially when he appears as a friend, as he did in Paradiſe, when he ſaid, <hi>You ſhall not die, you ſhall be as gods.</hi> As if he had ſaid, <hi>I am ſo much your friend, that I am come to perſuade you to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to better your ſtates, and to bring you into a greater glory: I propoſe nothing but what, if you obey me, ſhall turn to your good.</hi> Thus he beguiled them then, and hath done ſince, and may do thee, if thou abides not in the light which diſcovers him, and all his wiles and devices, formings and transformings. But as thine eye is ſingle, thou wilt always ſee and know him to be as he is, and not as he appears to be: So ſhalt thou never be deceived nor betrayed by him. But many aſſaults, trials, and temptations, thou muſt expect from him. Amidſt all, keep thine eye upon God thy Saviour, who hath given thee faith in him; which faith is indeed very precious, and very power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, able to overcome and give thee victory over all thy ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. If thou keep it, and grow in it, it will certainly be as an anchor unto thee, when ſtorms attend; as a ſhield and breaſt-plate unto thee, when enemies aſſault. Remember the counſel of <hi>Paul, Silvanus</hi> and <hi>Timotheus,</hi> to the <hi>Theſſalonians. Let us who are of t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Happy art thou that enjoyeſt it, and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with him that hath called thee to it, and wrought it in thee, and for thee; which is God, bleſſed and praiſed throughout all generations.</p>
               <p>Now, <hi>Chriſtian Reader,</hi> what I have here committed to the preſs, is from a deep and weighty conſideration, obſervation

This thou mayeſt have longed for and breathed after, and art now called to the poſſeſſion and enjoyment of; and not only ſo, but to the abiding and ſtanding faſt therein; ſo thou ſhalt never be entangled with the yoke of bondage again, nor turn back in thy heart to <hi>Egypt;</hi> nor ever hunger nor thirſt after the forbidden f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>To ſuch my earneſt requeſt is, (even in love and good-will to you) ſeeing you ſay you love, believe and honour the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;</hi> that you would ſhew yourſelves like the <hi>Bereans,</hi> with an unprejudiced mind ſearch the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> eſpecially theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. Be ſerious, take leaſure to read them, meditate a little, laying aſide thy carnal thoughts, and that wiſdom which is from beneath, which darkneth the counſel of God, and wreſteth the <hi>Scriptures.</hi> Then thou mayeſt clearly perceive, that it is no new doctrine to preach the <hi>Light,</hi> nor error to aſſent that it is the way of God, that leadeth all that turn to it and walk in it, into true <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> If any objection ariſeth and remaineth in thy mind, concerning the way of God here borne teſtimony to; if any words that can be read, writ or ſpoken, are able to give thee a ſatisfactory convincing anſwer thereto, the <hi>Scriptures</hi> are thoſe words, eſpecially to thee that profeſſeſt an honour and obedience to them.</p>
               <p>But this, in ſhort, I teſtify, That if thou ſlight the gift of God, the manifeſtation of his Spirit, light and grace beſtowed upon thee, and given unto thee, as one talent at leaſt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, thou canſt not underſtand nor receive the teſtimony of the Scriptures. If thou haſt any deſire to underſtand the <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> and things of God, thou muſt come to know and love the <hi>Light, Law</hi> and <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and feel the operation of it in thy own heart, to fit and prepare thee to underſtand the divine myſteries of his kingdom, and to inherit them; untill which, though thou mayeſt account thyſelf wiſe, rich and full, and may be cloathed with a profeſſion of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> yet thou art poor, blind, miſerable and naked; covered with a cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but not with the ſpirit of the Lord, not with a meek and quiet ſpirit; not with a Chriſt like ſpirit; not with the ſpirit of the primitive <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>

               </list>
               <p>THOU mayſt perceive and underſtand by theſe ſcriptures, that righteous men and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in ages paſt, were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the <hi>light</hi> of God ſhining in them; of the <hi>Word, Law, Power, Grace,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> of God manifeſting, appearing and operating in them; which if thou art a ſtranger to, thou canſt neither be a truly righteous man, nor a real <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> profeſs what thon wilt.</p>
               <p>Many who profeſs God, Chriſt and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> are fallen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch groſs carnality, that to ſpeak or write to them of the ſpiritual appearance and work of God, in and by his <hi>Light, Law, Grace, Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. and the powerful operations thereof within upon the mind, will, underſtanding and conſcience, ſeems ſo ſtrange, ſo new, ſo incredible, that they can in no wiſe pay any regard unto it; but rather mock and deride there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, as if they had never ſeen nor read the holy ſcriptures; whoſe teſtimony thereto is as clear as the morning without clouds. This is an evident ſign, that their eyes are cloſed, their hearts and ears are groſs and dull of hearing, their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding dark, and their minds ſo carnal, that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dead; <hi>for, to be carnally minded is death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this death, the carnal-minded man can talk of the fame of wiſdom, but poſſeſs and inherit folly, and lie down in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. This condition is much lamented by a little remnant, who are ready to ſay in love and good-will to their neighbours and countrymen, <hi>Come hither and we will tell you what the Lord hath done for our ſouls;</hi> which were as yours are, in death and darkneſs, in bondage and captivity, even while profeſſors of better things. The end of every true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> in writing, printing, preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is, that people might come to have the eye of their underſtanding opened, and know the day-ſtar to ariſe in their hearts, that they may ſee their way out of death, ignorance and carnality, and receive the light of life, and therein wiſdom to underſtand and receive the ſayings of holy men, recorded in the holy ſcriptures; until which, they will wreſt them to their own deſtruction, and never truly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand nor receive the comfort of them, nor of any words proceeding from the ſame ſpirit of God in this age. This is the word of truth to all it may concern, which, together with the ſcriptures I have quoted, I intend ſhall ſerve for anſwer to all objections that ſhall be made by the nominal <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or
<pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:013006_0013_0F8FAAF2B0D69040"/>bare profeſſor of Chriſt and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> into whoſe hand this little book may come; knowing aſſuredly, that there is no end of contending with ſuch with pen, ink and paper: But however, I can in truth ſubſcribe myſelf their friend.</p>

               <head>Some <hi>REASONS</hi> why the <hi>holy Scriptures</hi> are to be eſteemed and preferred, by true <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> above other Writings, though from the ſame Spirit, in this Generation.</head>
               <p n="1">I. BECAUSE they give an account of the divers diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and operations of God, before and after the fall, in order to lead mankind out of the fall, and to reſtore him into his primitive ſtate again. The manner, method and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of which, is, in the depth of the wiſdom of God, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ſet forth in the holy ſcriptures to the man of God, more than in any other book whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Becauſe therein are recorded the teſtimonies and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of many righteous men, throughout all thoſe various diſpenſations, appearances and operations of God before the law, under the law and prophets, and alſo under the Goſpel; being all briefly and plainly ſet forth to the man of God, for the increaſe of his learning, encouragement of his hope, ſtrengthening of his faith, and confirming of his confidence.</p>
               <p n="3">III. Becauſe the nominal <hi>Chriſtian</hi> pretends he hath a great eſteem for the ſcriptures, and cries them up for his only rule, to walk and order his converſation by; ſo that the true <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> and Miniſter of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> hath a great advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, in order to reprove, perſuade and convince him, that he doth not obey, nor walk according to his own profeſſed rule.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Becauſe it is the cuſtom, nature and practice of the ſpirit of darkneſs, deceit and perſecution, to deſpiſe, ſlight and contemn righteous men, their words and writings, while they live; and to garniſh their ſepulchres, and profeſs honor to them when they are dead; ſo though it be but in words, that they advance them above themſelves, as their rule and guide, they are of great ſervice to the true <hi>Criſtian</hi> and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> for the detection and conviction of gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayers,
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:013006_0014_0F8FAAF3A3590E98"/>and vindication of his doctrine and practice, life and converſation; therefore to be eſteemed above other writings, they being in ſome ſort as a wall of defence unto him.</p>
               <p n="5">V. Becauſe the general good and ſalvation of all mankind, is the principal aim and end of the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Miniſter; and ſeeing in this part of the world called <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> people profeſs a great reverence and eſteem for the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of holy men in generations of old; not much regarding what is written from the ſame ſpirit in holy men in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age, though one with the ſcriptures; as Chriſt convinced the <hi>Jews</hi> out of the law and the prophets, and <hi>Paul</hi> the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians</hi> out of their own poets: So the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt, who hath unity with the ſcriptures, and with the holy men's ſpirits that gave them forth, have the ſame ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage now againſt thoſe that only profeſs them in words, and live not the life they exhort to and call for. For this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we have good cauſe to value them above other books, tho' written from the ſame ſpirit in this age; becauſe thoſe people, who want the ſalvation the ſcriptures bear witneſs of, may come to be made wiſe through faith unto ſalvation by them.</p>

            <head>COUNSEL TO THE Chriſtian-Traveller.</head>
            <p>HAST thou put thy hand to the plow? look not back; Keep it there till the fallow ground be plowed up, and the briars and thorns rooted out and deſtroyed, that the ſeed may grow up in thee to perfection.</p>
            <p>Haſt thou known the kingdom, and the power in which it ſtands, like a little leaven hid in three meaſures of meal? Hinder not its working, let it leaven the whole lump.</p>
            <p>Doſt thou know the field where the pearl of great price is hid? Then dig deep and find it; and when thou haſt found it, ſell all and purchaſe it, and then thou wilt be the wiſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-man indeed.</p>
            <p>Haſt thou travelled out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> through the red ſea and wilderneſs? and haſt thou known the right arm of the Lord accompanying thee, and ſupporting thee in thy trials, temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and beſetments thou haſt met with therein? Keep ſtill to the ſame arm and power that hath called, led and ſuſtained thee hitherto, and it will bring thee into the promiſed land; and not only ſo, but he will give thee a poſſeſſion therein, and deſtroy thy enemies that did poſſeſs it. Thou wilt have a houſe given thee, thou didſt not build; a vineyard, thou didſt not plant; and a well thou didſt not dig, which ſhall ſpring up in thee to everlaſting life. Thou ſhalt ſit under thy own vine, and under thy own fig-tree, and lie down where none can make thee afraid. Thou ſhalt be bleſſed in thy baſked and in thy ſtore; in thy going out and coming in; lying down and riſing up. Theſe bleſſings ſhall aſſuredly attend thee, as thou loveſt the day of ſmall things, and art faithful in following the Lord, who hath appeared by his light and grace to thee,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:013006_0016_0F8FAAF4743A5898"/>for thy perfect redemption, reſtoration and everlaſting ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
            <p>I ſay, thou wilt certainly enjoy and inherit theſe things, and receive not only addition of virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to thy faith, but alſo the very end of thy faith; for faith and hope hath an end, and it is a bleſſed thing to receive the end thereof, even ſalvation; and there is none but ſuch as endure to the end, that can be ſaved, even to the end of the work of God, of the new creation of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Many may begin well, and make a good progreſs alſo, and yet fall ſhort. They may know the firſt day's work. Read <hi>Geu.</hi> i. <hi>The ſpirit of God moving upon the face of the waters; the appearance of light; and the diviſion of light from darkneſs; and to call the light, day; and the darkneſs, night;</hi> which is more than all the wiſe, prudent, religious men of this world can know or do; who are all as waters, and the whore ſits upon them; and the moving of the ſpirit of God they deſpiſe and diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard. The appearance of light they hate; ſo it ſhines in darkneſs, and is not divided, and darkneſs cannot comprehend it, cannot give true names to things, cannot call the light, day; nor the darkneſs, night; but err and miſtake ſo far, as to call the light, darkneſs; and the darkneſs, light: This all men in the fall are proue to and found doing, under the old heavens, and upon the old earth.—<hi>This is a note by the way, to thoſe it doth concern.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to proceed; they may alſo know the ſecond and third day's work; <hi>The firmament in the midſt of the waters; the waters divided; the dry land appear, and bring forth ſeed and fruit after its kind, which is good.</hi> This is more than words, names and profeſſions. Theſe have ſome ſtanding, ſome foundation in the midſt of the waters. Theſe are as trees that bear fruit, and the earth yields its increaſe to him that dreſſeth it.</p>
            <p>On the fourth day it is written, <hi>God made two great lights, the one to rule the day, and the other to rule the night.</hi> The light, and the rule and government thereof, may be known alſo; and as in the fifth day's work, there may be a <hi>bringing forth and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying abundantly; and a flying above the earth, in the open fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament of heaven;</hi> and the ſixth day's work may be known, <hi>Made in the likeneſs and image of God, bleſſed and endued with hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

If any thing appears therein that would intice and allure thee to break the law of God, ſee that thou conſent not; ſee that thou do it not; but abide in the rule and dominion that God hath given thee, not only over the ſerpent, but over all the works of his hands. In to doing, thou wilt underſtand the reaſon of the godly jealouſy and fear of the Apoſtle, who ſaid to ſuch as were brought to a good ſtate, <hi>even eſponſed to one huſband, in order to be preſented as a chaſie virgin in Chriſt:</hi> (which is a ſtate very near the marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-union) 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> xi. 2, 3. <hi>I fear,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>leſt by any means, as the ſerpent beguiled</hi> Eve, <hi>through his ſubtility, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis thou that art eſpouſed and adorned as a bride for her huſband; that art come to the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt; that haſt eſcaped the, corruption that is in the world through luſt; that art reſtored, redeemed and brought back again into innocency, and haſt a place in the garden of God, that the ſerpent would again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray, beguile and overthrow. Wherefore keep in the domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, power and wiſdom, which God hath endued, armed and ſurrounded thee withal, and he ſhall never prevail againſt thee. Look not at the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> any otherwiſe than to take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by him, leſt thou receive the ſame reward; but look at the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> in whom the ſerpent, the deceiver, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, hath no part; <hi>tho' he hath power to tempt in Paradiſe, and to make war in heaven, and appear before the Lord and accuſe;</hi> neither could he ever deceive, overcome or prevail againſt him; no more can he againſt thee, as thou keeps cloſe unto him, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with his power, <hi>and thy mind ſtayed upon God thy Saviour.</hi> This will bring thee into a ſurer ſtate than the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had, and for a time enjoyed in Paradiſe; thou mayſt come to be not only taken and put into the garden of God, <hi>to dreſs it and keep it,</hi> but thou mayſt alſo be brought to have a place in his houſe, in the temple of God, and alſo be as a pillar therein, and go no more forth. Thou mayſt become as Mount <hi>Sion</hi> that cannot be moved. Thy heart may be eſtabliſhed with grace, and fixed upon the rock that is higher than thee, againſt whom, neither the devices and allurements on the one hand, nor the

Thou mayſt come to ſee <hi>eye to eye, and know as thou art known.</hi> Thou mayſt come to know the Lord <hi>one,</hi> and his name <hi>one,</hi> the firſt to be the laſt, and the laſt to be firſt, and thy heavenly reſt with him, who is without beginning or end; to whom be praiſe forever more!

But in the way to this end there is great danger; as thou, that haſt been a traveller therein, knoweſt right well; and there are many things written for thy comfort and for thy learning in tl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap> holy ſcriptures, which I would have thee eſteem a great mercy that thou haſt the uſe and benefit of them; concerning which it is ſaid, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 15, 16, 17. <hi>They are able to make wiſe unto ſalvation, through faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> He is indeed the wiſdom of God, the opener of the ſcriptures, the only leader into the true underſtanding of them; and it is through faith in him, that the man of God comes to be made perfect, and thoroughly furniſhed to all good works. It is the man of God only, that hath the comfort of the ſcriptures, and that hath unity and fellowſhip with the holy men's ſpirits that gave them forth. It is he alone that underſtands them. They are as a ſealed book to the learned and unlearned, to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, or nominal <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and prophane. Great is the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of godlineſs which is revealed to babes, and hid from the wiſe and prudent ſchool-men of this world, who make a trade of the hiſtory of godlineſs for filthy lucre's ſake, to the danger of their own ſouls and others.</p>
            <p>Now, tender friend, that thou mayſt perſevere ſafely in thy way, always remember the counſel of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Take heed or pray that your flight be not in the winter, nor upon the ſabbath-day.</hi> Theſe two ſeaſons are the moſt dangerous. There is much in the words: The wiſdom of God ſpoke them, and thoſe that are endued with the ſame, only can underſtand them; and by the ſame thou mayſt be preſerved in and through the winter, and be able to ſay, <hi>The winter is paſt, and the ſummer is come, and the ſinging of birds is heard in thy land;</hi> and alſo know the Lord of the ſabbath, and reſt in him, who is the dwelling-place of his people in all ages and generations: To whom be glory for ever and evermore.</p>
            <p>Thus I have briefly ſhewed how the inward work, or new creation of God, holds parallel with the hiſtory of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward or old creation, and what danger attends thee, when thou art a plant of God, even in Paradiſe itſelf, which man loſt through diſobedience and tranſgreſſion.</p>

               </gap>y to ſet before thee, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and order of the wiſdom of God in thy reſtoration, and the danger that attends in the way thereto.

And the antitype, or thing ſignified thereby, the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling <hi>Chriſtian</hi> only underſtandeth. Theſe were great helps, great benefits and bleſſings, accompanying them in the way to the promiſed land.</p>
            <p>Yet conſider, notwithſtanding all theſe things, and all their experiences of the out-ſtretched hand, power and preſence of the Lord, his promiſes to the obedient, and his threatnings to the rebellious and diſobedient, yet they forgot the Lord, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back in their hearts, and ſo through unbelief, murmuring and diſobedience, fell by the way, and never entered into reſt, into the promiſed land that flowed with milk and honey. All miſcarried and fell ſhort, that came out of <hi>Egypt</hi> through the red ſea, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> above twenty years old, except <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Galeb;</hi> and when their off-ſpring came to poſſeſs <hi>Canaan,</hi> the promiſed land, conſider how in proceſs of time they corrupted themſelves, and grieved the ſpirit of the Lord, through their backſlidings and abominations, not only before, but alſo after God had cauſed his temple to be erected, and furniſhed in a moſt magnificent manner with veſſels of gold, ſilver and braſs, and other coſtly ornaments, <hi>with holineſs to the Lord, written thereon, and his own preſence and glorious appearance therein;</hi> after all this, through ſin and diſobedience, they became a prey to the ſpoiler, and were made captives, and carried away into a ſtrange land.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are written for the learning and warning of the wiſe in heart, whoſe eye God hath opened, and to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013006_0020_0F8FAAF91FC5F8E0"/>whom he hath revealed his arm of power, and done many wondrous works in and for them: that they turn not again into folly, careleſneſs, wantonneſs, pride and rebellion againſt the ſpirit of God: that they deck not themſelves with God's jewels, and play the harlot with them, as thoſe did, and ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the like reward in the myſtery as they did in the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; of which there is as great danger now in the inward, as there was then in the outward. Likewiſe in the diſpenſation of the ſpirit, in the end of the prophets, I may alſo hint at the work of God therein, and ſhew that the ſame danger at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends mankind in the way thereof. The myſtery of godlineſs is great, and the myſtery of iniquity is great alſo, and happy art thou if thou abides in the light of God, which makes them both manifeſt. It is not enough to know the light to ſhine; but to walk and abide in it, and be a true child of it. It is not enough to know the ſpirit of truth, and the power of it; but to be led by it, joined to it, become one with it, and to bring forth the fruit thereof. It is not enough to know the ſeed of the kingdom, and the ſowing of it; but its breaking through the clods, and growing up, not only into the ſtalk and blade, but into the full ear and corn; and not only ſo, but to be reaped and gathered into the garner, for the uſe of the Lord of the harveſt. It is not enough to know one of the days of the ſon of man, the child born, and the ſon given; but the government upon his ſhoulders, he reigning in thy heart, his and thy enemies deſtroyed. To attain thereto, according to the phraſe uſed in the holy ſcriptures, There is an overſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowing of the Holy Ghoſt to be known, a begetting and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chriſt within to be known, and a travailing to bring forth, a being born, and a growing up from one ſtature to another; from a child to a young man, from a young man to an elder, and a ſuffering with Chriſt; a taking up his croſs daily and following him: a dying with him; and a riſing with him, and a ſeeking thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God. Thou muſt be riſen with Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art in a capacity to ſeek thoſe things that are at the right hand of God; but it is a farther ſtate to find them, and to be ſeated in an heavenly place in Chriſt Jeſus, and to ſit down in the kingdom with <hi>Abrabam, Ijaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob;</hi> and the fartheſt and greateſt ſtare of all, is to know <hi>the kingdom delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up unto the Father, and God become all in all;</hi> where the alone ſafety is. Till which, though thou art a diſciple of Chriſt, and become as a chaſte wiſe virgin eſpouſed unto him, thou muſt watch and pray, keep thy lamp trimmed, and thy light burning, leſt thou enter into temptation; leſt thou ſlumber
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013006_0021_0F8FAAF9E32062C8"/>and ſleep, and the door be ſhut againſt thee; for there is a poſſibility, yea, a real danger of loſs in all ſtates and growths, until thou gets into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s boſom. There the gulph is known to be fixed. There is no changing ſtates then, as is ſignified in the parable of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus,</hi> Luke xvi. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us and you there is a great gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So, dear friend, thou mayſt perceive by what I have briefly hinted, by the current of the holy ſcriptures, and by thy own experience, that it is no eaſy thing to be a true <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to go through the work of regeneration, of the new creation of God in Chriſt Jeſus. It is no eaſy thing to go through the warfare, and be able to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, henceforth there is a crown of glory laid up for me;</hi> and to come to the wearing of the crown, and to be more than a conquerer in him that hath loved thee.</p>
            <p>Theſe things to witneſs and enjoy, is the bleſſed end of all the diſpenſations of God ſince the fall. He that is the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comer, is more than a conquerer, he hath received the <hi>white ſtone, wherein the new name is written, which none knoweth but he that hath it.</hi> He is the wiſe merchant-man, <hi>that hath ſold all and purchaſed the pearl of great pri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He is bleſſed with all ſpiritual bleſſings, in heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus. He is a co-heir, a joint-heir with him; and not only ſo, but he is come into the poſſeſſion of his inheritance. This is his ſtate, though he may meet with no better entertainment in the world, than Chriſt the captain of his ſalvation, and his diſciples did.</p>
            <p>So it is thy enjoying of the light of God's countenance, thy
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013006_0022_0F8FAAFB36079E88"/>being joined to the Lord, and being become one ſpirit with him, thy knowing the marriage-union, thy maker to be thy huſband; that is thy comfort, thy rejoicing, thy crown and dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem in proſperity and in adverſity; in heights and in depths in the palace and in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ngeon; in all ſtates, times and places. Thou art the only happy man, that art partaker of theſe things, though thy goods may be ſpoiled, and thy body in the hands of thy enemics; yet thou canſt really ſeal to the truth of that teſtimony of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. viii. 18. <hi>I reckon that the ſufferings of this preſent time, are not worthy to be compared to the glory that ſhall be revealed in us.</hi> To the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> this time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation is come; thou knoweſt the Lord come, and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward is with him <hi>an hundred fold,</hi> even <hi>in this time, and in the world to come, life everlaſting.

They that have reſigned up themſelves and all, into the hand of God, have nothing to looſe, have nothing to take care for, but to pleaſe the Lord; and it is the meat and drink of ſuch to do his will, and his paths are all paths of pleaſantneſs; there is no bitterneſs in the latter end of ſuch as walk therein.</p>
            <p>Conſider and be warned, by the examples recorded in the holy ſcriptures; always remember, that they tell thee of a people that came to the knowledge of God, his laws and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and manner of worſhip which he himſelf commanded, which while performed in ſincerity of heart, he was well pleaſed with, and his bleſſings and preſence accompanied them; but when they loſt ſincerity, uprightneſs and integrity of heart, though they kept in the exact practice and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the outward part of worſhip, yet all their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances were abomination to him, and rejected by him. This is teſtified by his prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſaying, <hi>He that killeth an ox, is as if he ſlew a man; he that ſacrificeth a lamb, is as if he cut off a dog</hi>'s <hi>neck; he that offereth an oblation, as if he offered ſwines blood; he that burneth incenſe, as if he bleſſed an idol.</hi> This is mighty ſtrange to thoſe that know not the real cauſe of it, that thoſe ſervices commanded, ſhould become ſo abominable in the ſight of him who commanded them. God looks at the heart, at the inſide; if that be gone aſtray, if that be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, degenerated, and fallen in love with the creatures, he accepts of nothing <hi>as well done</hi> from man in that ſtate; his righteouſneſs and his wickedneſs are both abomination to him. This was a ſore evil the people fell into under the diſpenſation of the law; <hi>they kept ſinning and ſacrificing, but neglected to hear and obey the voice of the Lord.</hi> Likewiſe in the diſpenſation of the goſpel, even in the firſt ages of it, the like evil was
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013006_0023_0F8FAAFBF82D35D8"/>creeping in. By the preaching of the Apoſtles, many were brought to believe in Chriſt, and to make profeſſion of him; and it ſoon grew to this paſs with ſome, that they were ready to ſit down, or reſt in profeſſion and knowledge of Chriſt after the fleſh, and to obſerve the form of godlineſs, but deny and neglect the power.</p>
            <p>The Miniſters of Chriſt, in the primitive times, had a great work before them,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> To perſuade and convince the <hi>Jews,</hi> that Jeſus was the Chriſt of God, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> promiſed and propheſied of by the holy prophets, whom they perſecuted and ſlew in one age, and honoured at leaſt with their lips, and garniſhed their ſepulchres in another.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> To oppoſe the continuance of their temple wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſhadowy and typical ordinances and obſervances, which God once commanded; and to bring them from under them to the thing ſignified by them; and to believe in him who was the end and ſubſtance thereof, who did fulfil all righteouſneſs contained in the law, in the prophets and <hi>John.</hi> When they had brought people to believe, that Chriſt was the great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet which God had promiſed to raiſe up like unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> how ready were many of theſe believers to ſit down in this belief, and to content themſelves with a knowledge of Chriſt after the fleſh; like as the <hi>Jews</hi> pleaſed themſelves with the temple of the Lord, and with their outward obſervances, while they wanted the root of the matter, <hi>viz. An upright, broken, contrite heart;</hi> which is and was the only ſacrifice God delighted in. So they were conſtrained to teſtify againſt the bare knowledge of Chriſt after the fleſh, <hi>Henceforth we know no man after the fleſh; yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh; we know him ſo no more:</hi> Preſſing the knowledge of him after the ſpirit, revealed, manifeſted and known by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his power and ſpirit within. In whom this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge was wanting, <hi>they were reprobates.</hi> It was not enough to know him born of the Virgin, and to increaſe in wiſdom and ſtature, and in favour with God and men, do many outward miracles, preach many excellent ſermous, give forth many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and heavenly precepts, go up and down doing good, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering by, for, and becauſe of ſin and ſinners, dying, riſing and aſcending into the glory of his father. It was not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to know and believe the biſtory and truth of theſe things, in the primitive times, neither is it now; but thou muſt alſo know and experience him in his ſpiritual appearance, power and operation inwardly, and perſevere therein to the end of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013006_0024_0F8FAAFCB37994F0"/>the work thereof; without which, thou wilt be as formal a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> under the profeſſion of Chriſt, and as much rejected in the account of God, as the outward <hi>Jew</hi> was, when he kept in the outward practice and form of religion, and cried up the temple of the Lord and its holineſs outwardly, while he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was a temple of unholineſs, uncleanneſs and corruption.</p>
            <p>So, dear friend and fellow traveller, that we may run to the end of our race, and be certain of the crown, that we may fight, not as thoſe that beat the air, but as thoſe that go on conquering and to conquer, keeping under all that would hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us from running well to the end, and that would deprive us of the crown, and betray us into the hand of our enemies; that we may do this, let us always remember the ſayings of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> who was a wiſe experienced traveller, and an able Miniſter of the new covenant.

            <p>So, to the grace of God which leadeth unto glory, and from one degree of glory unto another, I do heartily commend thee; which grace is ſufficient to teach thee all good, and preſerve thee from all evil; and in the ſame I remain thy friend and brother.</p>

            <p n="1">I. IT is a precious thing to know what <hi>the croſs of Chriſt is, and how to take it up, and make uſe of it;</hi> for indeed, it is no leſs than <hi>the power that crucifies ſin, and ſaves from it;</hi> which <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> too generally being ignorant of, ſets up ſomething elſe inſtead thereof, and ſo ſin remains alive uncrucified, and ſalvation is wanted; for it is not all the gold, ſilver, and wooden croſſes, nor voluntary humility, in the whole world, that is able to crucify one ſin, as to the nature of it, nor to make any one diſciple; nor enable to watch with Chriſt one hour, nor follow him one ſtep in the regeneration.</p>
            <p n="2">II. It is a bleſſed ſtate, to know the <hi>eye of the mind,</hi> not only opening, but <hi>opened;</hi> thereby is ability and wiſdom wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed to read in the book of life, wherein all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge are hid; and he or ſhe that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth this light ſhining, this eye opened in them, walks and ſtumbles not. This eye and light within, is that which <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom</hi> too much deſpiſe and reject, therefore walk in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtumble, and know not whether they go. Whilſt we ourſelves did ſo, we were darkneſs, walked in it, and our feet ſtumbled upon the dark mountains.</p>
            <p>That which ſhut and ſtopped this eye, and darkned this light within, in the beginning, was ſin and tranſgreſſion, whereby mankind loſt the ſight and enjoyment of his Creator. And this I teſtify, That no people upon the face of the earth, come to witneſs this <hi>eye of the mind</hi> openly again, but as they come to experience that power in themſelves which crucifies ſin, and ſaveth and redeemeth out of tranſgreſſion, and are alſo obedient and ſubject unto it.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The remembrance of the <hi>firſt day's work</hi> is very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, even the ſeparation of the light from the darkneſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, whereby we came to know each, its name and nature, and to have our minds turned from the darkneſs <hi>within,</hi> to the light <hi>within;</hi> from the power of ſatan <hi>within,</hi> to the power of God <hi>within;</hi> from the teachers and books <hi>without,</hi> to the grace, the anointing, the true teacher <hi>within.</hi> The remembrance of this is very precious: And now what remains, but that we walk in this light, that we may be the children of it indeed,
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013006_0027_0F8FAB0152A69110"/>and that we be always obedient to this power, and learning of this anointing, till we are fully learned. It is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of all; it is the end of all words and writings; yea, it is the end of all the diſpenſations of God ſince the beginning.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The precious light which ſhineth in the heart, is the <hi>everlaſting day of God,</hi> in which he walks, and in which he works. bleſſed are thoſe that walk with him, and work with him; they can tell of his mighty acts, and ſpeak of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous works. Thoſe that walk in this light, and are become children of this day, are wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>neſſes of the true everlaſting worſhip, which is <hi>in the ſpirit and in the truth.</hi> Such me come to the ſubſtance and end of all the legal adminiſtrations and temple worſhip, which conſiſted much in daily killing, and daily offering of bullocks, rains and lambs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now thoſe that are come to the worſhip in ſpirit, witneſs <hi>a daily dying, and a daily offering, till death is known.</hi> Such know, that it is eaſier to kill a bullock or a ram outwardly, than to kill or mortify the beaſtly nature within: And it is a greater work to witneſs the will wholly reſigned up into the will of the Lord, and the thoughts and imaginations brought down into the obedience of the croſs, than to perform the outward part of worſhip commanded in the law. I teſtify to all, that thoſe who know not the beaſtly nature ſlain, and offered up in themſelves, and their thoughts and wills ſubjected, are not come to the end of the law, nor from under it, nor to the one everlaſting offening, Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="5">V. It is very precious, not only when we meet together, but at all times, to feel <hi>our minds exerciſed by, and meditating in the law of the Lord,</hi> which is ſpiritual. Thoſe that are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this law of the ſpirit of life, and walk in obedience to it, no evil nor temptation ſhall prevail againſt; but they will witneſs ſalvation for walls and bulwarks. Some were wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of old, that <hi>the law of the Lord was pure and perfect.</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are witneſſes of the ſame this day, and know it ſo by the operation of it: and know themſelves ſubjects of that law, which is ſpiritual within, which judgeth every vain thought, and every idle word, and bringeth down every vain imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. It is a bleſſed ſtate, to be meditating in this law day and night. For I teſtify, that this law of the ſpirit of life within, was mankind's rule, whereby he walked innocently and uprightly before tranſgreſſion entered, and before out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward characters were invented, or before any outward law was written or engraved on tables of ſtone. To this again are many called, and many are coming, and come; and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever bleſſed are thoſe that walk therein and are ruled thereby.</p>

VI. The <hi>true knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is very precious; to know him as he was before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, and to know the knowledge of him after the fleſh paſs away. Such know him to be the tree of life, which grows in the midſt of the garden of God, ſit under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit is ſweet to their taſte. They that eat thereof, know that food which the world is ignorant of, and is beyond words. Fruit and eating are more than words. Such are come to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the goſpel promiſes fulfilled, and they need no man to teach them; no man need to ſay to his neighbour, <hi>Know the Lord;</hi> for the knowledge of him abounds in their hearts.</p>
            <p>That which make the meetings of the righteous to differ from all other meetings in the world, is to feel Jeſus the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the midſt of them, and to feel their hearts and minds in unity and fellowſhip with him. This ſeeling and knowing, tranſcends all words and profeſſions; for, for a time Chriſt's very diſciples did not ſo know him, whilſt he was with them in that prepared body; therefore a remnant can call that day bleſſed, wherein their minds were turned from the darkneſs within, to the light within, which reveals and makes Chriſt manifeſt again, as he was with the father before the world began, and as he was before <hi>Abraham</hi> was.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It is now as truly witneſſed as it was of old, <hi>That the eye of the Lord runs to and fro through the earth, beholding the evil and the good;</hi> even that eye which ſearcheth the heart, and trieth the reins, and ſheweth to man his thoughts. Our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſteth in this, that we have a teſtimony within our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that our hearts are upright and ſincere in the ſight of this eye. This was it which God had reſpect unto in all ages; for when his choſen people the <hi>Jews</hi> degenerated from uprightneſs of heart, notwithſtanding they kept in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward performances and obſervations, as keeping <hi>appointed feaſts, new moons, and ſabbath-days, ſolemn aſſemblies, killing, and offering ſacrifices,</hi> &amp;c. yet all theſe things, while their hearts were gone aſtray from him, and were not upright and ſincere in the ſight of this eye of the Lord, their performances were not accepted, but were abomination unto him.</p>
            <p>It is a precious thing to witneſs, that our hearts are up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right in the ſight of the Lord, or before his eye, that runs to and fro through the earth; that that ſin may never overtake us, which overtook the <hi>Jews</hi> of old, <hi>viz. to keep the outward form, and looſe the power.</hi> Our ſolemn aſſembling, our form of ſound words, and our outward demeanour, which the life of truth led us into at firſt; if we feel not the ſame life accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying of us, and preſerving us in it, that we may be a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013006_0029_0F8FAB02F58DA7E0"/>living people, walking uprightly before the Lord; I ſay, without this, all is vain and unprofitable.</p>
            <p>It is the honeſt and upright heart that is the good ground, where the ſeed of the kingdom grows and proſpers, and brings forth acceptable fruit.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. It is a very precious thing, to witneſs a <hi>true waiting upon the Lord.</hi> Many great and glorious promiſes are made to thoſe that truly wait upon him. <hi>They that wait upon the Lord ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap> want no good thing:</hi> This, to witneſs and enjoy, is the ſub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ce of all. While we waited upon invented means, men and books, upon our own thoughts and imaginations, our own wiſdom and underſtanding, we wanted the good things; theſe were not ſufficient to lead us to the knowledge, nor the enjoyment of them.</p>
            <p>Hereby may all <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> ſo called, be tried and judged, even by this one word; they pretend a worſhipping and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Lord, but they want the good things, and the evil things abound amongſt them; ſo are hereby found falſe witneſſes, who ſay they wait upon the Lord, and he hath not fulfilled his promiſes to them. A remanant are at this day true and faithful witneſſes, that the Lord is faithful, juſt and true to his promiſes, and that he hath fitted and furniſhed them with the heavenly treaſures, the good things of his kingdom, as they truly wait upon him. This waiting doth not begin when our ſolemn meetings begin, neither doth it end with them, but remaineth always.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. The <hi>Truth</hi> in itſelf is very precious, and the revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and knowledge of it in our hearts, is alſo very precious. It is in this <hi>Truth,</hi> that God is worſhipped with that worſhip which is more acceptable than all the worſhips in the world, whoſe worſhippers profeſs the <hi>Truth</hi> in words, but know it not, neither are they made free by it; ſo are found falſe worſhippers and falſe witneſſes; for the revelation and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the <hi>Truth</hi> brings to freedom, freedom from ſin; gives power over vain thoughts, over paſſions, over the will and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate affections, and alſo removes the ground from whence all evil ſprings.</p>
            <p>The revelation and knowledge of this <hi>Truth,</hi> brings into that righteouſneſs which exceeds the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees; it makes clean the inſide. All other knowledge and religion in the world makes clean but the outſide at moſt; but this the inſide, and then the outſide will be clean alſo.</p>
            <p>Oh! what a lamentation may be taken up for the greater part of mankind, who are not only ſtrangers to the revelation
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013006_0030_0F8FAB052BDF3B50"/>and powerful operation of the <hi>Truth</hi> in the inward parts, but alſo through the wiles of the enemy of their ſouls everlaſting peace, are begotten into a belief, <hi>That it is impoſſible to witneſs a clean inſide, and to be delivered from all evil on this ſide the grave.</hi> They are eaſily perſuaded, that the enemy of their ſouls is always near them, ready on the right-hand and on the left, to draw them aſide into the way wherein they ought not to walk; but have no knowledge nor faith in the heavenly <hi>Truth, Virtue</hi> and <hi>Tower</hi> preſeut, which is able to ſave out of all temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to deliver out of the ſnares of ſatan; and therefore are taken captive at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate we ourſelves were; but now the knowledge of the <hi>Truth</hi> is come, and the powerful operation of it we are witneſſes of. Let us perſevere and walk in the ſame, that we may witneſs the end of its work, which is to finiſh and make an end of ſin, and bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs. This is the ſubſtance of all, and the end of the <hi>Truth</hi> revealing itſelf.</p>
            <p>Now in the preſent ſenſe and enjoyment of the revelation and knowledge of the powerful operation of the <hi>Truth within,</hi> in our own hearts, we cannot but call to mind the days paſt, in which the Lord waited to be gracious unto us, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with his mercies and with his judgments; often knocked at the door of our hearts, and often appeared unto us, though we knew him not; and his long-ſuffering was great, wherein he waited to ſhew himſelf kind and gracious unto us, ſtanding at the door till his locks were wet with the drops of the night, and we let him not in, neither received his kindneſs, becauſe we neither knew him, nor his love.</p>
            <p>But now he hath revealed himſelf unto us, he hath opened that eye that can ſee him, and our hearts to receive him, and is come to make his abode with us. Oh! Friends, how are we engaged to walk anſwerable to this great love, which we are made partakers of! Indeed <hi>we love him, becauſe he firſt lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us.</hi> We wait upon him, becauſe he firſt waited upon us. May not we ſay, as ſome of old ſaid, <hi>What manner of love is this, that we ſhould be called the ſons of God, and be inheritors of ſuch precious promiſes,</hi> and poſſeſſors of the knowledge of that one everlaſting <hi>Truth</hi> which makes free!</p>
            <p>But Friends, when the knowledge of this <hi>Truth</hi> is enjoyed, there is a poſſibility of loſing it again; the holy ſpirit which ſealeth and eſtabliſheth in it, if it be grieved, it will not do its work, and <hi>a vain thought, given place unto, will grieve it; an idle word will grieve it:</hi> Therefore it concerns us all, to wait and watch in that which preſerveth and keepeth out of all evil, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> forever.</p>
            <p n="10">

X. It is a bleſſed and happy ſtate, to have <hi>the teſtimony with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ourſelves,</hi> that our minds are exerciſed in that wherein ſtands the everlaſting univerſal worſhip, which is not limited to time nor place.</p>
            <p>This worſhip is not like the worſhips which are among the ſects in the world, who pretend only to worſhip God in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain places, and at certain times, and think God is pleaſed with their pretended ſerving him one day in ſeven; or one hour in ſeven; though at other times they ſerve themſelves and the evil one, ſpeak their own words, think their own thoughts, and do their own works.</p>
            <p>Oh! it is lamentable to behold, when I look over the ſtate of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> and ſee the apoſtacy it is degenerated into, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſomething of the form, but denying the power.</p>
            <p>Here is our bleſſedneſs and true happineſs, that we have our minds exerciſed in the heavenly light that brings to, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerveth in the true everlaſting worſhip which is inward, <hi>in the ſpirit and in the truth;</hi> which all <hi>Temple</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> worſhip ontwardly at certain times, and ſet places, were but a type and figure of. This worſhip <hi>in the ſpirit and in the truth,</hi> is the antitype, it is the ſubſtance of all thoſe typical, temporary worſhips. Oh! my friends, let none of us be found out of this everlaſting univerſal worſhip, which doth not begin when we meet together to wait upon the Lord a few hours, to be refreſhed together in the ſenſe of his preſence; neither doth it end when we part.</p>
            <p>And friends, this reſts upon my ſpirit to teſtify, That none can enjoy true bleſſedneſs and ſpiritual conſolation to their ſouls, farther than they have a teſtimony in themſelves, that they walk in the precious everlaſting light that now ſhineth. To this light our minds were at firſt turned, in which God dwells, and in which the worſhip <hi>in ſpirit and truth</hi> is learned and performed, in this age as in ages paſt. The way is, and hath been throughout all generations, ONE, and it is a plain path-way; the way-faring man, though a fool, cannot err in it.</p>
            <p>In this light, many are now witneſſes that God loved them, even while ſinners; and that in the days of their darkneſs and ignorance he waited upon them, to ſhew himſelf gracious; though then they had no faith in him, no eſteem for him, neither could they ſee any comlineſs in him, <hi>his viſage being more marred than any man's.</hi> Thus he appeared, till the light ſhined out of the darkneſs, and gave the knowledge of his glory, which as they walked in, they became living witneſſes of his power in ſalvation, redemption and tranſlation from
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013006_0032_0F8FAB07280642F8"/>darkneſs and the power of ſatan, to the marvellous light and power of God; out of the corrupt nature and degeneration, into the pure divine nature and regeneration; and ſo became plants and trees of righteouſneſs, bearing fruit unto God, and giving him the glory and praiſe of all his works, who alone is wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> thoughout all generations, forever.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. It is a bleſſed ſtate, <hi>always to live in the ſenſe and feeling of that love which firſt viſited us,</hi> wherein our minds were turned to the light which ſhined in the darkneſs; for we were then darkneſs; which light then made manifeſt and revealed unto us the <hi>Gift of God</hi> given to us, which is compared to a little leaven, to a grain of ſeed, to a pearl hid in the field. It is precious to know the <hi>Leaven to work,</hi> the <hi>Seed to grow,</hi> the <hi>Field to be purchaſed,</hi> and the <hi>Pearl found, bought and poſſeſſed.</hi> This is more than talk and profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Now can many ſay, as was witneſſed of old, <hi>We are come un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him as unto a living ſtone, elect and precious, and we are kept by the power of him unto ſalvation; and we are in him in whom there is no condemnation:</hi> Thus to road and witneſs the ſcriptures, is beyond all the talk and notions that are in the world which lies in wickedneſs, where the guilt and condemnation is.</p>
            <p>As we continually live in the ſenſe and feeling of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious love which at firſt ſought us out, and pulled ſome of us as brands out of the fire, and others as ſwine wallowing in the mire; as we remain ſenſible of this love, we ſhall feel our hearts more and more engaged to walk worthy of it; <hi>and not only profeſs grace, but live under it; not only profeſs light, but walk in it, that we way be perfect children of it;</hi> for if we live not the life of what we profeſs, ſorer judgments will purſue us than many others, who are called as we are, but have not taſted of the heavenly power as we have. Therefore it concerns us to be watchful, and retain our firſt love; for it is poſſible, after the houſe <hi>is ſwept and garniſhed, and the unclean ſpirits caſt forth, that they may return and enter again.</hi> Therefore it is very precious not only to know that bleſſed power that caſteth forth the unclean ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and ſweepeth and garniſheth the houſe with heavenly treaſures; but alſo to dwell and abide in the fame, by it to be preſerved from being defiled again. This is the ſubſtance of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion.</hi> This is the end of all miniſtring, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and writing. This is more than hearing ten thouſand fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. Let us always remain in the feeling of, and obedience to this power, and we ſhall never fall.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. It is more than words can expreſs, <hi>to feel and enjoy that wherein the kingdom of Heaven ſtands.</hi> It is written in the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſcriptures, <hi>That the kingdom of Heaven ſtands not in meats and
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013006_0033_0F8FAB0735C9E5C0"/>drinks, and outward waſhings; but in the power and joy of the holy ſpirit.</hi> To enjoy this, is the ſubſtance of all; but none come to receive the joy of the holy ſpirit, but ſuch only who are kept by the power in which the kingdom ſtands; which power preſerveth from evil, and keepeth from falling into temptation. Many may come to the knowledge of this power, and may profeſs it, and have ſome faith in it; which is beyond all notional ſectarians in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> yet if they live not obedient to it, and witneſs a being kept by it to the end, they come not to be children of this kingdom, nor to ſit down in it, nor enjoy the comfort and pleaſures thereof.</p>
            <p>The bare profeſſion and knowledge of the power is little worth, but a being preſerved by it; for if any enter into evil and temptation, ſuch grieve the holy ſpirit, ſo cannot have the joy of it, wherein the kingdom ſtands. This is that which chiefly diſtinguiſheth us from the divers ſects in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> a being <hi>preſerved in the power,</hi> and not <hi>a talking of it only.</hi> It is written in the holy ſcriptures of truth, that Chriſt Jeſus, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> when he was tempted by the devil with ſore and grievous temptations, <hi>eat nothing,</hi> but by the power of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that dwelt in him, withſtood the devil and all his temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and when he departed from him, <hi>angels miniſtred unto him.</hi> The ſame power which preſerveth in temptations, and keepeth from eating or receiving the bait of the enemy or tempter, are we all to witneſs in the time of trial and hour of temptation.</p>
            <p>It was the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> that eat when he was tempted. Now his eating implies a taking or letting in ſomething; a giving place to the devil's bait, whereby the temptation entered. He did not ſtand in the power wherein the heavenly kingdom ſtands, which is able to preſerve, as did the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> So departing from this, he loſt the joy of the holy ſpirt, which the kingdom ſtands in; as all the children of the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> do, who have not faith in that power that ſaveth out of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>This is the ſubſtance of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> which we are called to the profeſſion and poſſeſſion of, viz. <hi>The power and joy of the holy ſpirit, in which the kingdom ſtands;</hi> which power ſtrikes at the root of all the wickedneſs and evil in the world, and is the ax that is laid to the root of the evil tree, which has grown up in the apoſtacy. This is that by which <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> muſt be reformed. No ſound reformation but by this in the particular, and in the general.</p>
            <p>Friends are witneſſes, and many could ſeal it with their lives, that there is no other way nor means appointed of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013006_0034_0F8FAB07F4C24960"/>God, to come to ſit down in the kingdom of Heaven, nor to attain everlaſting ſalvation, but by believing in the power of God, in the light of Chriſt <hi>within,</hi> to which our minds have been directed. Indeed, among the many ſects in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> there are divers other means <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d ways invented and ſet up; but we know them all to be vanity. We have tried and prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, and know there is nothing of worth in them. We are now come to the true and living way, the ancient path, in which the righteous in all ages ever walked. Now this remains, that we always feel our hearts engaged to walk in this way, and to keep ſenſible of that power which ſaveth from evil, that we may adorn our profeſſion; for if any, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs this everlaſting way, enter into temptation, or commit evil, they do not adorn their profeſſion, but are a ſcandal to it, and lay a ſtumbling-block in the way of others, who are where we were, when wandering in deſolate places, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling in the deſart howling wilderneſs. The day of ſuch will be turned into darkneſs, and the curſe due to him that lays a ſtumbling-block in the way of the blind, and that lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him out of his way, will fall upon him.</p>
            <p>Therefore it concerns all to be watchful, and perſevere in that which is good, to be as lights of the world, and as the ſalt of the earth indeed; that we may never leave ſhining, nor loſe our ſavour. Whatſoever was written aforetime, was written for our learning; and it is profitable to meditate and conſider, that many in former ages had much experience of the power and preſence of the Lord, ſaw many of his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous works, and travelled through the red ſea and wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the borders of the promiſed land; yet through mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mering and diſobedience, entered not therein, nor did enjoy the end of the Lord in bringing them out of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s land. And many may in this age fall ſhort as they did, if we walk not cloſe with the Lord, and learn by what is written to take warning, leſt by diſobedience and unbelief, we fall ſhort of receiving the great recompence of reward.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. The <hi>Bread of the kingdom,</hi> is the joy of the holy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit felt and known <hi>within,</hi> which ſatisfieth and refreſheth the ſoul. This is the bread which comes down from Heaven. The ſhew-bread, in the outward temple, was a type and figure of this bread, which is indeed the antitype and ſubſtance thereof. The table, in the outward temple of the Lord, was furniſhed with outward bread: As we witneſs our bodies the temple of the Lord, we ſhall enjoy this bread, which that was but the type and ſhadow of. This is the bread that filleth and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the hungry, when huſks and all outſide things cannot.</p>

XIV. Many are living witneſſes in this day, as of old, <hi>That the foundation of God ſtands ſure;</hi> and that this foundation, as now made manifeſt, was the foundation of the righteous in all ages; that the light, grace and ſpirit of God within, which mixeth, not with vain thoughts and evil imaginations, but diſcovers them and judgeth them, is this foundation. This is the ſtone the builders in their natural wiſdom reject and deſpiſe, and cry up other ſtones, and invent other foundations, according to the imaginations of their own hearts.</p>
            <p>Now it is a bleſſed thing, and the duty of every particular, to witneſs themſelves living ſtones, built upon this foundation, and to have their hearts and minds united to it, and framed with it.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. The ſame grace, the ſame anointing, <hi>which was the ſaints teacher in the primitive times,</hi> is revealed and witneſſed in this our day and time. It is a bleſſed thing always to learn of him; for many that have come to the revelation of this teacher, not waiting low in that which did reveal him, that ſelf might be made of no reputation, and the will and ſelfiſh ſpirit brought down, have been deceived, and have learned of the falſe teacher, the Antichriſt, inſtead of the true, yet under the name of the true; this hath happened in ſome among ourſelves, ſince we were a people; for this know, that no people ever worſhipped the whore the mother of harlots, the beaſt, falſe prophet and Antichriſt, under thoſe names and denominations; but being deceived, gave them good names, and believed her to be the true woman, the lamb's wife, the true prophet, and the true Chriſt. This <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ath been the ſtate of all the Apoſtates in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> for as the myſtery of godlineſs is great; ſo is the myſtery of iniquity great alſo; and there is none but thoſe that come truly to learn of the grace of God, the anointing within, that are able to diſcern between the one and the other.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is precious always to learn of the grace and anointing, and to walk in the light which our minds were at firſt directed to; this reveals the deep things of God, and finds out the hidden things of <hi>Eſau.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The very remembrance of the time wherein our minds were turned from the ways, inventions and teaching of men <hi>without,</hi> to the light, grace and anointing <hi>within,</hi> is very precious; for hereby we are made partakers of a meaſure of the ſame wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and revelation, which <hi>John</hi> wrote his book of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in. The ſame ſpirit which he was led by, to give names to things, according to their nature, and not according to their appearance, is now again witneſſed. The great whore, the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013006_0036_0F8FAB0973C4F9B8"/>mother of harlots, the beaſt and falſe prophet, and the golden cup that is held forth to the nations, the Antichriſt in the temple, and the great red dragon that <hi>John</hi> ſaw in Heaven, by the ſame ſpirit are now revealed and judged; and as we keep our hearts and ears open to this teacher, we can never be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by them again.</p>
            <p>All the nominal profeſſors and ſects in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who learn not of this teacher, are ſo far deceived, that they believe the whore is the Lamb's wife, and her golden cup, the cup of bleſſings, and ſo are greedily drinking of it; not diſcerning the falſe prophet and Antichriſt from the true, becauſe he get into the temple of God, and cloaths himſelf like unto an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of light, and like unto the true Chriſt: Such take the great red dragon, that appears in Heaven, to be the Lamb of God.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is a bleſſed thing, always to keep our minds ſtayed, and our feet walking in the heavenly light that now ſhineth, which reveals the true teacher, that teacheth and diſeovers all things, and gives to ſee to the ground and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of things; to diſcern ſpirits; and keep out of that wherein the myſtery of iniquity prevails.</p>
            <p>All the teachings of men and books in the world, are but droſs and dung in compariſon of this divine teacher the <hi>Light, Spirit</hi> and <hi>Grace of God within.</hi> This was man's teacher and guide before books were written; before an outward law was written; and this I teſtify, in the word of the Lord, that the teachings of all men, books and writings, which tend to divert the mind of mankind from this divine teacher within, are vain and unprofitable, and proceed from that wiſdom which is earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſenfual and deviliſh; and all that lend an ear unto it, are captivated in the myſtery of iniquity; ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth which makes free, ſo long as they abide under ſuch teachers.</p>
            <p>Many are living witneſſes, that as they gave up to be taught, and led by the true teacher, the anointing within, they ſoon became wiſer than all their former teachers</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. The ſame everlaſting power, which preſerved the righteous in all ages paſt out of evil, and from falling into temptations, is <hi>now revealed and witneſſed in this our day and age;</hi> even the ſame power and arm of ſalvation that preſerved <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt, Job</hi> in all his trials and temptations, <hi>Daniel</hi> and the three children, and all the primitive prophets and <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> out of all the fiery trials, aſſaults and buffetings of ſatan they met withal.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is a bleſſed thing to be truly acquainted with
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013006_0037_0F8FAB0B977DF638"/>this power, and always to live in the ſenſe of it; for it is poſſible that people may come to the knowledge of this power, and make a profeſſion of it, and witneſs ſalvation and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by it, in a great meaſure, yet if they wait not low in their minds, till it has fully wrought the work of ſalvation and redemption in them, or wholly brought every thought and imagination into the obedience of Chriſt, ſubdued their own wills and ſelfiſh ſpirit, and know ſelf made of no reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and nailed to the croſs; I ſay, without this, they may fall into the ſnare of the devil again, be captivated and led into temptation again: For it is about ſuch, the tempter and deſtroyer goes like a roaring lion ſeeking to devour, even thoſe, out of whom he hath been caſt and diſpoſſeſſed. It is written, <hi>He rules in the hearts of the children of diſobedience.</hi> He needs not go about ſuch, being got within them; there he is in his throne.</p>
            <p>But it is about the righteous, out of whom he hath been eaſt, <hi>be goeth,</hi> who are redeemed from under his power, and tranſlated out of his kingdom; it is againſt ſuch he appears not only like a roaring lion, but as a ſubtle ſerpent, and angel of light.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is a bleſſed thing, always to live in the ſenſe, knowledge and feeling of this ancient power, which alone ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth and delivereth in the midſt of all trials and beſetments of the evil one; as the eye of the mind and underſtanding is fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon it, no temptation can prevail; and to know thy faith increaſed in it; for faith in this power of God is compared to a ſhield, which is able to quench all the fiery darts of the devil, and to give victory over him.</p>
            <p>Now that which was our miſery and loſs in the time of our ignorance and darkneſs, is the miſery and loſs of mankind in their unregenerate ſtate. We had no faith in the ſpirit of God, which convinceth the world of ſin. We did not believe, that the ſame hand of power that ſmote us for ſin and tranſgreſſion, was able and ſufficient to heal us; neither did we regard the ſtrivings of God's ſpirit within; neither did we give heed to him that ſtood at the door of our hearts and knocked, who long waited to ſhew himſelf gracious unto us; and was as a light ſhining in darkneſs, but we regarded it not, and ſo did not know the virtue and powerful operation of it. In this unbelieving diſobedient ſtate, we were children of wrath as well as others, but having obtained mercy to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, we have now, in the ſtate above, left all the world cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, by reaſon of their unbelief and hardneſs of heart.</p>
            <p>And herein is the love, exceeding kindneſs and mercy of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013006_0038_0F8FAB0C73EC34B0"/>God manifeſt, in that he loved us, while we were enemies; and waited to ſhew himſelf gracious, while we were ſinners; to be reconciled unto us, when we were in rebellion againſt him; and enlightned us, when we were darkneſs; and often called, when we were running from him; and was near and ready to teach us, when we were ignorant and did not deſire the knowledge of his ways. In this was the exceeding love of God manifeſt to us then, and is the ſame to all the world now. His love is univerſal to all, as is teſtified in the holy ſcriptures; <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son a light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very precious to walk in this light, which doth reveal the love and kindneſs of God, and brings to the knowledge and experience of the means of ſalvation which he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; and to the feeling of that power which ſaveth from falling into temptation, even the ſame power which preſerved Jeſus when he was tempted in the wilderneſs. Now if any that are come to the knowledge and profeſſion of this power, are not preſerved by it from falling into temptation, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from evil, ſuch are not obedient nor faithful to it, ſo do not adorn their profeſſion; <hi>Such do not glorify the power, but are as ſpots in our feaſts, and a ſcandal to the goſpel of peace, and enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, which is the power of God to ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now thoſe that live in, and are obedient to this power, are the wiſeſt, happieſt and ſafeſt people in the world; bleſſed above all the families of the earth. Bleſſed with an hundred fold in this world, and in the world to come, life everlaſting. Such are as the ſalt of the earth which ſeaſoneth all things, as a city on a hill which cannot be hid, and as the lights of the world indeed.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. Many are living witneſſes, that <hi>the law of the ſpirit of life,</hi> unto which their minds have been directed, <hi>is pure and perfect.</hi> They witneſs it ſo by its operation in them, by which every appearance of evil is condemned.</p>
            <p>It is the happineſs of every particular, to have the witneſs or teſtimony within themſelves, that they love this law, and that they meditate in it day and night. <hi>Oh!</hi> ſaid one of old, <hi>how I love thy law!</hi> It is only thoſe that love it, that are true witneſſes of its purity and perfection; for it is poſſible, that a perſon or people may not only profeſs and talk of this law, but come to ſome knowledge of it alſo, and yet not love it, nor meditate in it, nor feel the power and peace of it.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that love the law of God, are converted, and made wiſe unto ſalvation by it; and though their enemies are very
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013006_0039_0F8FAB0D972F5550"/>many, and very night alſo, yet they cannot prevail againſt them that love this law, They are the happieſt people of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth. No evil prevails againſt ſuch; and as it hath been witneſſed of old, <hi>viz. Great peace have thoſe that love thy law.</hi> So thoſe are living witneſſes of the ſame <hi>great peace</hi> in this age, who love the law, which is light. <hi>Thy law is light,</hi> ſaid one. He that loves the light, brings his deeds unto it, by it to be tried and judged; and after this, the <hi>great peace</hi> is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed. Peace is the reward of thoſe that love the law of God; peace in the inward parts, even the peace of God, which the world cannot give nor take away.</p>
            <p>This one word or ſentence may try all the ſects in <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and others who profeſs themſelves lovers of the law of God, yet have not peace in their dwellings; theſe have not the anſwer of a good conſcience, which keeps void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God and man; have not that peace which paſſeth the underſtanding of man in the fall; know not their hearts and minds kept by it; but are found in the evil-doing, where the tribulation and anguiſh is, and in that fear which brings tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>So where the doing of evil is, the law is not loved.</hi> Let thy talk and profeſſion be what it will, what is written is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly true, <hi>He that doth evil hates the light;</hi> and he that hates the light is wicked, to whom there is no peace; the law being no light to his feet, nor lanthorn to his path. He walks in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſtumbles, and knows not at what; and in the end lies down in ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is very good for every particular, not only to know the law of God, but alſo to live in the ſenſe and love of this law at all times; when they are about their common oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions in the world, as well as in their ſolemn aſſemblings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord. The love of this pure law of the ſpirit of life, which judgeth every appearance of evil, makes wiſe unto ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, wiſer than all former teachers; and to hear, love and obey his law, or word in the heart, is the end of all words, outward diſpenſations and miniſtrations, though proceeding from the power of God itſelf: For had not mankind degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the love and obedience of this law or command of God, tranſgreſſion had never entered, neither had ſin had a being in the heart of man, neither had an outward law been added or given forth; <hi>that being added becauſe of tranſgreſſion, and hath power over the tranſgreſſor, ſo long as he liveth diſobedient, and a ſtranger to the law written in the table of the heart by the finger of God;</hi> which was before an outward law was written either
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013006_0040_0F8FAB0E0253B7E8"/>in a book or on tables of ſtone, and before the cauſe of it was brought forth into the world.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. The <hi>day-ſpring</hi> from on high, and the <hi>everlaſting light</hi> hath and doth ſhine out of darkneſs in the hearts of many in this age; and they are, by the heavenly ſhining thereof, come to the knowledge of the field where the treaſure is hid, and to the ſight of that whoſe worth and beauty tranſcends all the treaſures and pleaſures this world can afford. None are to reſt in the bare knowledge of the field, but to ſell all and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it.</p>
            <p>All the ſects in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who believe not in the light within, and deſpiſe the day of its appearance within them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, are ſo far from enjoying this heavenly treaſure, that they are wholly ignorant of the place or field wherein it is hid.</p>
            <p>This is ſealed in the hearts of a remnant, that there is no other way, no other means, no other key to be found to open the heavenly myſteries, nor to unlooſe the ſeals thereof, and to lead into the enjoyment of the heavenly treaſure, but the holy divine light, which in their hearts hath appeared and ſhined gloriouſly, to the diſcovery and deſtruction of the man of ſin and myſtery of iniquity, which once wrought and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led therein. In this light they have believed and walked, and ſeen the wonderous works of the Lord in the deep, while the people and nations, that deſpiſe and hate it, walk and dwell in darkneſs, and in the region and ſhadow of death, where the poverty, woe and miſery is; where the ſtumbling, grop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, falling, and wandering in deſolate places is; where the labouring for vanity, and lying down in ſorrow is; therefore are the hearts of ſuch greatly engaged unto the Lord, to walk worthy of the riches of his grace, light and heavenly treaſure, he hath made them partakers of.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. The light of the glorious goſpel <hi>now ſhineth;</hi> the day of ſalvation <hi>is come,</hi> even the ſalvation of God, which he hath prepared before the ſace of all people.</p>
            <p>This is the day of great ſalvation, which many righteous men and prophets ſaw afar off, and propheſied of, that is now revealed unto us. It is a bleſſed thing, not only to know the appearance of the day of ſalvation, but to know the joy of it, the joy of God's ſalvation; and to know it as walls and bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warks, to ſave and defend not only from the beſieger without, but from the enemy within alſo.</p>
            <p>This is the glorious light of the goſpel, that ſhineth in this day of ſalvation now revealed, which as we walk and abide in, we ſhall be as ſtrong as an army with banners, and witneſs
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013006_0041_0F8FAB0EB6C13A28"/>victory over our enemies within, which are our greateſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. To be ſaved from thinking our own thoughts, and ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own words, and doing our own works. This is the great ſalvation that brings to the ſabbath of reſt; to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing holy day to the Lord. One that enjoyed this ſalvation, aſked this queſtion; <hi>How can we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation?</hi> It is a queſtion that includes an impoſſibility; for there is no eſcaping wrath to come, by thoſe that neglect this great ſalvation that has now appeared unto them, there being no other way nor means appointed of God beſides this goſpel light, or great day of ſalvation, which to us hath appeared.</p>
            <p>This is my teſtimony, That none can receive the joy of God's ſalvation, enter into the ſabbath of reſt, or keep holy-day to the Lord, further than they know a ceaſing, and a being ſaved from thinking their own thoughts, following their own wills, and obeying their own wiſdom; for the ſelfiſh thoughts that ariſe within, are the root of evil, and as the foundation of the kingdom of darkneſs; and the light of this day of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is as the ax laid to the root of the evil tree.</p>
            <p>So it is a bleſſed thing for people to meet and wait together, and walk together in this heavenly light and day of ſalvation, which diſcovereth and judgeth every vain thought and fooliſh imagination, ſubdueth them, and bringeth them down into the obedience of Chriſt. In this, as they walk and abide, they truly differ from all other families of the earth; for in this heavenly <hi>goſpel light,</hi> which judgeth every appearance of evil, ſtands the true fellowſhip and true unity. It is the foundation of that church, againſt which the gates of hell ſhall never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; as they walk and dwell therein, the power of death and hell ſhall never break them, but they ſhall remain as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> which can never be removed. In this ſtands their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and ſafety: Out of this they are as weak as other people.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. It is a bleſſed thing, to wait for <hi>the appearance of him</hi> who is the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and for <hi>the coming of his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> but it is more bleſſed to be witneſſes of his appearance, and to know his kingdom come; and moſt bleſſed of all, to know a ſitting down in it with him, in the glory of his father, and our father, his God and our God.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. It is a bleſſed thing, truly to know <hi>how to wait for the appearance of Jeſus,</hi> and to know him <hi>when he doth appear;</hi> I ſay, this is very bleſſed; but it is more bleſſed, or a greater degree of bleſſedneſs, to be witneſſes of his appearance, and to join with him when he doth appear; and ſo to experience the end of his appearance accompliſhed, abiding with him till
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013006_0042_0F8FAB0FB2563B00"/>it be finiſhed; truly underſtanding the end wherefore he doth appear, and their ſtate and condition at his appearance. This is the main thing chieſly to be underſtood and minded through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all diſpenſations.</p>
            <p>And under them all, he is to be carefully minded and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, though it be in his firſt or loweſt appearance, which is to convince of ſin, ſelf-righteouſneſs and judgment; in order to deſtroy fin, finiſh tranſgreſſion, and bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs. Except people abide with him, and love his appearance in the miniſtration of condemnation, which brings tribulation and anguiſh upon the ſoul that hath ſinned, they can never come to enjoy and inherit the miniſtration of life and ſalvation, nor never come to enjoy the glory of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance the ſecond time, without ſin unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>This is the loſs and miſery of mankind, and was our loſs and miſery in the day of our ignorance, that they know not how to wait for the appearance of Chriſt, or the coming of the juſt one; neither do they, nor did we, know him when he did appear, for he often appeared unto us, and ſtood at the door of our hearts, and knocked, and waited to ſhew him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf gracious unto us; but we not knowing it was he, did not regard him, nor open unto him; yet he was indeed the deſire of our hearts, and him whom we longed to enjoy, and is the deſire of all nations, the light and ſalvation of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the conſolation and glory of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but in this was our loſs and miſery, that we knew not how to wait for his appearance, neither did we know him when he did appear. So I ſay again, It is a bleſſed thing, for a people to know how to wait for the appearance of Jeſus, the Saviour, and to know him when he doth appear.</p>
            <p>But behold, this is a greater degree of bleſſedneſs, To be witneſſes of his appearance, and to know the <hi>coming of the juſt One,</hi> or the <hi>Riſing of the Sun of righteouſneſs, with healing under his wings,</hi> and to be able to ſay, with the primitive <hi>Chriſtians, We know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whereby we may know him that is true, and are in him that is true, even in his Son Jeſus Chriſt; this is the true God and eternal life.</hi> This is an high and heavenly knowledge, and a bleſſed ſtate. This the mark and prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus, we have been called unto; and this is the ſtate all are to wait for, inherit and poſſeſs, and not ſit down ſhort of it. If this be not witneſſed and enjoyed, all profeſſion is vain, all knowledge is vain, all religion and talk of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is vain and of no worth; for it is he that believes that Chriſt is come <hi>in the fleſh,</hi> and that demonſtrates the livingneſs
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013006_0043_0F8FAB13152DB8F0"/>of his faith by the works thereof, that is <hi>of God,</hi> and <hi>God dwelleth in him,</hi> and <hi>he in God.</hi> This is more than a bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion or verbal confeſſion, according to the teſtimony of <hi>John</hi> the Divine, in his firſt epiſtle, Chap. iv.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. It was a ſpiritual and heavenly viſion which the Prophet <hi>Daniel</hi> had, when he ſaw the interpretation of the King's dream; <hi>A ſtone cut out of the mountain without hands, ſmite at the feet of the image, and break in pieces the iron, the braſs, the clay, the ſilver, the gold, and become a great mountain that filled the whole earth.</hi> A remnant in this age are come to the ſame ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting light and ſpiritual eye, whereby they ſee the power of God, ſignified by that ſtone, prevail againſt all <hi>Imagery,</hi> not only without but within alſo; and know the ground of it ſhaken and removed. The dark thoughts and imaginations of men, are the grounds of the imagery upon the face of the earth; and that power that breaks them down, and brings every thought into the obedience of Chriſt, is the antitype of that ſtone, and its work revealed to <hi>Daniel,</hi> and dreamed of by the King. In this day of light and knowledge, ſome are come to witneſs this little ſtone become a great mountain, and to fill the earth, and to be the chief foundation, and corner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone elect and precious; the rock and hiding place of the righteous in this, and all ages.

            <p n="23">XXIII. This I teſtify, That the way of life and everlaſting happineſs, the way that brings to the ſitting down in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob,</hi> which was the way of the righteous in all ages, <hi>is now again revealed and made known.</hi> This way is the true everlaſting light that now ſhineth, not only in darkneſs but out of it; which light is the thing our minds were at firſt turned to, which judgeth every appearance of evil, every vain thought and evil motion that ariſeth within; and as there is a walking in this way, a ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down in the kingdom will be experienced: For we have been and are called to inherit ſubſtance, to poſſeſs life, and to ſit down with Chriſt in heavenly places.</p>

So it is a precious thing, for all that know this way to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in it, till they poſſeſs theſe things, and in the ſame abide; which way is the light of Chriſt within, and there is not another; and the walking in this way diſtinguiſhes them from all the nominal profeſſors upon the face of the earth, even this light that judgeth every appearance of evil.</p>
            <p>It is a precious ſtate, to feel the mind ſtayed upon the Lord, walking in his way; to know the girdle and bridle of <hi>Truth,</hi> and a being girded and bridled with it; to know every high thought and imagination brought down and ſubjected unto Chriſt <hi>the light, the way.</hi> This is poſſible to be known now, as in time paſt.

            <p n="28">XXVIII.

            <p>This light is the one everlaſting way, that leads unto him that fits and prepares to enter the kingdom of Heaven, gives free acceſs to God, and the throne of his grace, and preſents unto him without ſpot or wrinkle.

This worſhip, the world and the high profeſſors in it are ſtrangers to. In this we differ from them all, even as we are found waiting and worſhipping in that which ſilenceth all fleſh, and brings to the ſtanding ſtill, and beholding the ſalvation of God.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of truth, which convinceth the world of ſin, is that wherein the univerſal worſhip of God ſtands, and is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. This I teſtify of it, That there is power and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in it, not only to convince of ſin, reprove and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn for ſin, but alſo to convert, change, cleanſe, and redeem the whole world of mankind from ſin, if they would believe in it, love it, receive it and obey it. <hi>This is the condemnation of the world, that light is come into it, and they love darkneſs rather,</hi> and will not bring their deeds to the light, love, believe nor

            </p>
            <p>Many are witneſſes of the power and ſuſſiciency of this ſpirit of truth, and of its redeeming power from ſin, and the ſtrength of it; ſo are not convinced by it as the world is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing redeemed from committing of it; they know it to be their comforter and leader into all truth. It is very precious to be found in the true diſciples ſtate, waiting for the comfort and leading of the ſpirit of truth, and witneſſing the ſame within themſelves. A remnant in this day, who have received this ſpirit, and followed the leadings of it, are able to ſay as ſome of old did, <hi>We are not come to Mount</hi> Sinai, <hi>where the voice of words is heard, where the thunderings, lightnings, and earthquakes are,</hi> but to <hi>Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>the city of the living God, the heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem; and to <hi>an innumerable company of angels;</hi> to the <hi>general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born, which are written in Heaven,</hi> and to <hi>God the judge of all;</hi> to the <hi>ſpirits of juſt men made perfect;</hi> to <hi>Jeſus the mediator of the new covenant,</hi> and to <hi>the blood of ſprinkling, that ſpeaketh better things than that of</hi> Abel. This is an high and heavenly ſtate, which the primitive <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> were come unto, while in their earthly tabernacles they enjoyed the heavenly treaſure. Such have the witneſs in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that they are inhabitants and fellow citizens of this heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whereinto no unclean thing can enter; even while they dwell in theſe houſes of clay, they walk in this city, and have their converſation in Heaven with God, Chriſt, and holy or juſt men's ſpirits made perfect. This, the ſpirit of this world, though cloathed with the name of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</hi> cannot bear.</p>
            <p n="30">XXX. It is a very bleſſed ſtate, to be found true waiters for, and witneſſes of the <hi>ſecond coming of Chriſt,</hi> which is <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin unte ſalvation;</hi> for true happineſs doth not conſiſt in having ſeen one of the days of the ſon of man, or in being witneſſes of his firſt appearance, wherein he convinceth and reproveth for ſin; but in waiting for, and witneſſing his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming to cleanſe, ſave and redeem from ſin: Herein is the joy of God's ſalvation felt and enjoyed.</p>
            <p>Chriſt's appearance is firſt to convince of ſin; and this is a miniſtration of condemnation, which is glorious in its time: but there is a miniſtration which exceeds in glory, which all are to wait for, witneſs, and not ſit down ſhort of. This is the mark of the high calling, the high and heavenly ſtate which they are called to, even to know the ſecond coming of Chriſt without ſin unto ſalvation, and a being preſented to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013006_0047_0F8FAB15ADDD2278"/>without ſpot or wrinkle. This to poſſeſs and enjoy, is the end, ſum and ſubſtance of all the diſpenſations of God towards mankind ever ſince the fall. This is the end of all good words and writings, and the end of Chriſt's firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond appearance.</p>
            <p>All men have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God, therefore muſt know the miniſtration of judgment and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation fulfilled in and upon them, before they can know the glory that is in it, and before they come to know the ſecond miniſtration, which exceeds in glory.</p>
            <p>It is a precious thing to be <hi>inward with the Lord,</hi> and to feel our hearts drawn nigh unto him, waiting for the appearance of Chriſt, that when he doth appear, we may appear with him in glory. This is the high and heavenly ſtate that ſome were in, when they could ſay, <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Father and with the Son.</hi> This to witneſs, is the feaſt of fat things propheſied of, and the broad rivers and ſtreams which make glad the city of God, beyond what all the dainties of the earth can afford. This is the ſoul's delight, reſt and happineſs, which ſome did enjoy in former ages, as a remnant do in this age, praiſes to God forever.</p>
            <p>To mind the ſpirit, or to be ſpiritually-minded, not only in our ſolemn meetings, but at all times, is our duty, and very precious; Then will the teſtimony of one in the primitive times be found true, when he ſaid, <hi>To be ſpiritually-minded is life and peace.</hi> Death and trouble are taken away, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of condemdation is ended, having done its work; the word which was as a hammer, fire and ſword, hath broken down, burnt up, deſtroyed and purged away the filth of the daughter of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and is now become as milk, honey and balm; and as a glorious light that ſhines more and more unto the perfect day; as a ſhield, fortreſs and tower of defence, where everlaſting peace and ſafety is; ſalvation being as walls and bulwarks, againſt which the enemy cannot prevail, nor nothing that would defile enter. In this ſtate ſome were in the primitive times, when they could ſay, <hi>We can do nothing againſt the truth, but for it;</hi> and it is poſſible to ſay and do the ſame now.</p>
            <p n="31">XXXI. It is a bleſſed thing for a man to know within himſelf, and from a living experience to be able to ſay, as one of old did, <hi>The Lord is my ſhepherd, I ſhall not want.</hi> Such are witneſſes of the truth of thoſe ſayings of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>My ſheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me, and I give unto them eternal life; and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall

            <p n="32">XXXII. It is a very bleſſed thing, for people to know <hi>how to worſhip God aright,</hi> and to be <hi>found in this worſhip,</hi> not only at ſet times and appointed places, but at all times, and in all places. This is the ſpiritual worſhip, or the worſhip in ſpirit and in truth; and theſe are the ſpiritual worſhippers which God ſeeks and accepts. This worſhip excels all other worſhips upon the face of the earth at ſet times and appointed places, which ſtand in ſaying ſo many prayers in a day, and reading and ſinging ſo many leſſons a day, and hearing ſo many ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons a day, and other outward obſervations. This worſhip ſtands in time, place, letter and form; but they that worſhip God aright, it is in the ſpirit and in the truth, which is pure and univerſal.</p>
            <p>As people are found in this worſhip, they differ from and excel all others upon the face of the earth. Theſe worſhippers know what it is to bow at the name of Jeſus; what it is to know every thought brought into the obedience of Chriſt; what his rule, government and great authority is; and how all power in heaven and in earth is given unto him, and how all are to worſhip him as they worſhip the father, whether things in Heaven, or things on earth, or things under the earth. Theſe can confeſs with their tongues that Jeſus Chriſt is Lord, to the glory of God the Father, truly and experimentally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witneſſes of his heavenly power and rule in their hearts, mitals and underſtandings, giving victory over all vain thoughts, ſelf-will, carnal deſires and wanderings of the mind. Theſe are the worſhippers that know the old man put off with his deeds, and the new man put on; the old things caſt away, and all things become <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013006_0049_0F8FAB18EE47B3B8"/>the good things they teſtify of. What the righteous in all ages did enjoy, ſuch are partakers of and are in unity with juſt men's ſpirits, being come to God the judge of all, who is bleſſed forever.</p>
            <p>Our peace, joy, conſolation and continual happineſs ſtand in this, in being exerciſed in this worſhip, witneſſing the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God, the name of Jeſus, over all in ourſelves; all bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under it. and yielding obedience thereto, as in innocency before tranſgreſſion, <hi>where the earth was ſubdued in the dominion of God, and the heavenly rule was over all.</hi> This the true worſhip in the ſpirit and in the truth brings again into, and maketh free from the contrary, as truly as teſtified in the ſcriptures, <hi>If you know the truth, the truth ſhall make you free;</hi> free from the evil that is in the world, from the evils within, from the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies within, which are the greateſt enemies. Except this freedom be known, all other knowledge is vain; all religion and profeſſion vain; all talk of God, Chriſt and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> vain.</p>
            <p n="33">XXXIII. Bleſſed are thoſe who have their minds and hearts always exerciſed by that which <hi>leads into the fellowſhip of juſt men's ſpirits made perfect.</hi> Such have alſo unity with their words and teſtimonies left upon record in the ſcriptures of truth, as is written by one in the Pſalms, <hi>Bleſſed is the man that walketh not in the counſel of the ungodly, nor ſtandeth in the way of ſinners, nor ſits in the ſeat of the ſcornful; but his delight is in the law of the Lord, and therein doth meditate day and night.</hi> The ſame bleſſed ſtate is to be witneſſed now, which is more than to read and ſing all the Pſalms; and he is the only bleſſed man that doth thoſe things. If <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> had learned this leſſon, which they have read and ſung, they would not have become as a waſte howling wilderneſs, and as a deſert which brings forth no fruit to God, having lent their ear to the wicked one, and walked in the way of ſinners ſo long, till they are brought to believe, that it is impoſſible to walk in any other way, while on this ſide the grave.</p>
            <p>In this condition we ourſelves were, while the vail of the covering was over our hearts. We dwelt in this thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where the lending the ear to the wicked is, where the way of the ſinner and ſeat of the ſcornful is, and knew not the way out of it. That which diſperſed this thick darkneſs, took away the vail from off our heart, ſtopped the ear that hearkned to the wicked one, blinded that eye which led to walk in the way of ſinners, and brought down that exalted ſpirit that ſat in the ſeat of the ſcornful; I ſay, that which hath done this for us, was and is no other than the power of
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013006_0050_0F8FAB193AAF77D0"/>God working in his precious light, to which our minds were at firſt turned, and in which we have believed; which as we walk and abide in, we witneſs ſuch ſayings as theſe in the ſcriptures fulfilled, <hi>They that ſee ſhall be made blind, and they that are blind ſhall ſee; and the blind ſhall be led by a way they know not, and the lame ſhall leap as an hart; and the mighty ſhall be brought from their ſeat, and thoſe of low degres exalted.</hi> As this is abode with and walked in, that hath wrought theſe things, a delight in the law of the Lord is known, and a meditating in it day and night.</p>
            <p>There is nothing elſe able to preſerve us from lending an ear to the wicked one again, and from walking in the way of ſinners again, and to keep down the ſpirit of exaltation from riſing again, but the delighting and meditating in this law. This is the law of the ſpirit of life which hath made free, and is able to preſerve us in the freedom whereunto we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. All that are ſtrangers to this law, and a meditating in it, they give ear to the wicked, walk in the way of ſinners, and ſit in the ſeat of the ſcornful, let their profeſſion be what it will.</p>
            <p>By this one ſcripture all the ſects in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who profeſs the ſcriptures to be their rule, may try themſelves, whether they are in the ſtate of the <hi>bleſſed man;</hi> or in the ſtate of the <hi>curſed man.</hi> They need not hire a ſchool Doctor, or learned Rabbi, to give them the meaning of the ſcriptures, they being ſpoken by plain men, and underſtood only by thoſe that are come to the ſpirit. <hi>Thoſe that obey the wicked one, lend their ear to him;</hi> and <hi>thoſe that commit ſin, walk in the way of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            </p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV. It is one of the fundamental doctrines of <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> to believe that God is <hi>omnipreſent</hi> and <hi>almighty;</hi> that is, <hi>preſent at all times and in all places.</hi> This is generally profeſſed and believed among the ſects in <hi>Chriſtendom;</hi> but in them it is no more than a bare profeſſion, a traditional and hiſtorical faith, they not being true witneſſes of the ſame. Herein is the difference betwixt thoſe who do, and thoſe who do not, witneſs the preſence of the Lord, and the almightineſs of his power: The firſt only know the ground and reaſon why <hi>Moſes,</hi> that eminent ſervant of the Lord, ſaid, <hi>If thy preſence go not with us, carry us not hence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the delight of the ſoul of the righteous in all ages and generations paſt, and is now; even to feel the comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preſence of the Lord, and to know the light of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance lifted up upon them. This makes their hearts more glad than the increaſe of corn, wine and oil, and is better than them all. This was the ſtrength and encouragment of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013006_0051_0F8FAB19F8A6EE00"/>the righteous in all ages, and made them willing to ſuffer for his name. This carried them through the water and through the fire. This made them ſing and rejoice in the priſon and in the ſtocks, and ſuffer the ſpoiling of their goods joyfully. And Friends, except this living preſence be felt and enjoyed, known and lived in, we are as weak as other people; and if any loſe or depart from it, ſuch will become as wicked as others alſo.</p>
            <p>Therefore it is a very precious thing, for every particular always to prize the riches of that grace, and the glory of that light, which their minds were at firſt turned to, which grace and light hath led a remnant into the preſence-chamber, into the banqueting houſe, where the banner over them is love, and is leading others into the ſame; and would guide and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect all out of the way of evil, into the way of peace. Oh! the freeneſs of this love and grace, and the glory of this light which hath led a remnant, that hath loved it and followed it, into the preſence-chamber, into the banqueting houſe, and to the top of that holy mountain, where the feaſt of fat things is enjoyed, and the wine well refined drank of; to the right-hand, where the rivers of pleaſure are. This is free grace and love indeed. This love is ſtronger than death, and better than life. Oh! the conſideration of this love is able to break the heart, to melt the ſoul before the Lord, and to diſſolve it into an holy reſignation and pure reſolution to walk to the praiſe, and magnifying of it among the ſons and daughters of men, that they may be won and perſuaded to accept of its tenders, and follow its leadings; that they may know the pleaſantneſs of its paths, and witneſs the virtue and operation thereof, in their own ſouls.</p>
            <p n="35">XXXV. It is a bleſſed thing, and an high and heavenly ſtate, for every particular to be witneſſes within themſelves, that <hi>Self is made of no reputation.</hi> There is not a people upon the face of the earth, that are in the way to this ſtate, but ſuch whoſe minds are turned to the light of God within, and are exerciſed thereby; which alone diſcovers and makes ſelf manifeſt in all his appearance, thoughts ways and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and leads thoſe that walk in it, to the true ſelf-denial, without which there is no ſalvation.</p>
            <p>For the deſtruction, loſs and miſery of all mankind, came in at this door, when he gave heed, credit and reputation, to his <hi>own ſelfiſh deſire, thoughts, reaſonings</hi> and <hi>imaginations;</hi> and <hi>would know of himſelf, be wiſe of himſelf,</hi> &amp;c. Then the ſerpent, which ſpoke of himſelf, prevailed over him; then he entered into the temptation of the devil, and loſt his dwelling place in Paradiſe.
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013006_0052_0F8FAB1ABB856958"/>Thus the enemy of man's happineſs, under a pretence of advancing him and bettering his ſtate, and making him of ſome account and reputation, drew him into a ſtate of loſs and miſery. <hi>Self-reputation</hi> was the firſt bait of the enemy, and will be his laſt; therefore watch diligently againſt it, for herein his power ſtands, and by this bait he overcame the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> therefore it is a bleſſed thing to live in the power of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Adam</hi> which makes <hi>ſelf of no reputation.</hi> For as ſin and the devil entered and prevailed by reaſon of ſome ſelf-reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo ſhall he be caſt forth and overcome by the power of God, in all thoſe in whom it makes ſelf of no reputation. This is a principal leſſon of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> which all of neceſſity muſt learn, in ſome meaſure, before they can be ſo much as a diſciple of Jeſus, as himſelf teacheth; <hi>If any man will be my diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, he muſt deny himſelf, and take up his croſs daily, and follow me.</hi> Denying of ſelf, and taking up the croſs, are inſeparable, and muſt precede diſcipleſhip; yet this ſtate is ſhort <hi>of being a friend of God, and co-heir with Chriſt; bone of his bone, and fleſh of his fleſh;</hi> and ſhort of ſitting down with him at the right-hand of God in the kingdom of Heaven; and of knowing the Son to ſurrender the kingdom up unto the Father, and God to become all in all; ſhort of knowing it meat and drink to do the will of God, and his fruit ſweet to their taſte, and to ſit under his ſhadow with great delight, glorified with that glory which Chriſt had with the Father before the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan. In this ſtate, ſelf is made truly of no reputation; the firſt birth is ſlain, the ſerpent's head is not only bruiſed, but broken and ſubdued; the ſecond birth rules, the elder ſerves the younger, who delights naturally to do the will of God; and it is not a croſs to it, neither is the croſs to be taken up by it; this is the ſheep that know Chriſt's voice, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth him with delight, and a ſtranger it will not follow.</p>
            <p n="36">XXXVI. It is a bleſſed thing, for people to know <hi>the name of the Lord.</hi> They that know it can truſt in it; being as a ſtrong tower unto them, and as a wall of defence, within which the righteous dwell ſafely, and unto which they fly when <hi>danger doth attend.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is very precious for people to meet together and wait in this name; ſuch find Jeſus the Saviour, in the midſt, and know a mounting up as with the wings of an eagle. Such know their bread ſure, and their water fails not. Such meet and wait for the better, and not for the worſe; they wait not in vain; their ſtrength is renewed; they mount upward, and they know the name of the Lord as precious and as powerful now, as in ages paſt. They know it as a ſtrong tower indeed, as a ſafe
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013006_0053_0F8FAB1B99FF5988"/>hiding place, and as precious ointment poured forth, and ſo they love it, becauſe of the ſweet ſavour thereof, and becauſe they have been made clean, and are preſerved by it as virgins; and can ſay, <hi>Thy name is as precious ointment poured forth, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do the virgins love thee.</hi> It was virgin ſouls in ages paſt, that loved the name of the Lord. It is the virgins now, that love the name of the Lord. Thoſe that are joined to any other lovers, cannot love the name of the Lord; though they may pretend much love thereto, their hearts are gone a whor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after other lovers; and though they profeſs love to the name of the Lord, and take it often into their mouths, and draw nigh to him with their lips, yet their hearts are gone aſtray, and they do not depart from iniquity; ſo though they confeſs and profeſs the name of God in words, they deny him in works. Such confeſſors and profeſſors cauſe the name of God to be blaſphemed among the <hi>Heathen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the name of the Lord, by which he hath made known himſelf unto us, viz. <hi>Light.</hi> The pure everlaſting light that now ſhineth in our hearts, this is the name of the Lord; for God is <hi>Light,</hi> and in him is no <hi>darkneſs</hi> at all.

            <p>In this name, the light, there is no occaſion of ſtumbling; as we love this name and walk in it, we are ſo far from falling, that we ſtumble not. It is out of this name the ſtumbling and falling is, the evil-doing is; <hi>He that doth evil hates the light, and doth not bring his deeds, thoughts and words to it;</hi> ſo walks, talks and works in the darkneſs; not knowing what he ſaith, whither he goeth, nor what he doth.</p>
            <p>All the profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and all the ſects upon the face of the earth, may be tried, meaſured and judged by this one ſaying, notwithſtanding their talk of loving the name of the Lord, yet if they <hi>do,</hi> or commit <hi>evil, they hate the light.</hi> This is an univerſal, infallible truth, let the proſeſſion be what it will. If people are found in the evil-doing, they hate the light, are enemies to God, loving their evil deeds.</p>
            <p>This name of the Lord, the light, which makes all things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, and judgeth every appearance of evil, is that which the ſect-maſters in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> deſpiſe and ſet at nought; and ſo know not the ſalvation that is in it; but to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in it, this name is precious, and they have and do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the ſweetneſs and ſalvation that is in it; and this is the
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013006_0054_0F8FAB1E1F5F24A8"/>ſalvation ſuch have waited for, and do partake of, even to be ſaved from ſin, from doing, ſpeaking and thinking of evil, while they dwell in theſe houſes of clay, in theſe earthen veſſels; ſuch have, do and may enjoy the heavenly treaſures.</p>
            <p>It is a ſtrong deluſion indeed, and a groſs doctrine of devils, that hath overſpread the world of mankind in the great night of apoſtacy, wherein and whereby people are taught and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, <hi>that it is impoſſible to ceaſe from ſin, term of life;</hi> and that, though they continue and remain therein, <hi>yet they ſhall enjoy the ſalvation of God after they are dead.</hi> This may very fitly be called the doctrine of devils, and a ſtrong deluſion; a ſtate wherein people are given up to believe a lie; ſeeing, as the tree falls ſo it lies, and there is no repentance in the grave.</p>
            <p>This is the happineſs of a remnant in this day, that they know the name of the Lord exalted, and ſet above every name in them, in Heaven and in earth, and know every thing bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it, and worſhipping before it. Here the King of right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs is upon his throne; here the righteous bear rule, and the land rejoiceth; and peace is within their borders.</p>
            <p>This is my teſtimony, That none can enjoy true peace, but as they witneſs this name of the Lord exalted in their hearts above every thing; above gold and ſilver, houſe and land, wife and children, and ſelf-reputation; yea above all heavenly names as well as earthly; and every thought and imagination brought down and ſubjected to it. There is no other name given under Heaven, whereby men can be ſaved from their enemies within, which are their greateſt enemies, but as they witheſs this name of the Lord exalted in them; even his name who ſaid, <hi>I am the light of the world.</hi> This light ſheweth unto man his enemies, and not only ſo, but deſtroyeth them with the breath of his mouth, and the brightneſs of his coming. Power is in his name, the light, which makes all things mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, to deſtroy and expel all that is contrary to it, and redeem mankind from under the power of it. This a remnant are living witneſſes of in this our day, and are ready, in love and good-will, to tell their neighbours, countrymen and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, what the name of the Lord, through their loving of it, hath done for their ſouls; that they may be perſuaded to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and come to experience the like great ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Great is the knowledge that is broken forth in our hearts and underſtandings, and glorious is the light of that day that now ſhineth; what then remaineth, but that all that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this knowledge, do walk anſwerable to it; and that all in whom this light ſhineth, abide in it and love it; ſo a vain

            <p>This light that judgeth every appearance of evil, is a day of judgment, wherein men give an account for every idle word they ſpeak.</p>
            <p n="37">XXXVII. It is a certain truth, teſtified by the Apoſtle, when he ſaid, <hi>Great is the myſtery of godlineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this is one of the great myſteries, that <hi>God is very nigh unto the ſons and daughters of men;</hi> many of them are very far from him. God is in the world, but the world knows him not; and God, who is light, ſhineth in darkneſs, but the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs doth not comprehend him. He is in men, and they live, move and have their being by him; yet they are without him, without God in the world; ſtrangers to him, though he is not far from every one.</p>
            <p>In this ſtands the happineſs of a remnant, that they know God not only nigh them, and in them, but alſo they know themſelves nigh unto him; he dwelling in them, and they in him. Theſe are they that enjoy the effect of that bleſſed prayer of Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>That they may be one, as thou Father, and I am one; I in them, and thou in me.</hi> This is the bleſſed unity and heavenly fellowſhip, which the primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were witneſſes of, when they ſaid, <hi>Truly our fellowſhip is with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and with his Son.</hi>

            <p>This is a ſtate worth waiting to feel and enjoy. It is more than words can expreſs, and is the end of all words and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations.

XXXVIII. It is the bleſſing of all bleſſings, to know <hi>the low valley,</hi> where the <hi>green paſtures</hi> are, where the <hi>ſafe feeding is,</hi> where none <hi>can male af<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>d;</hi> the feeding in this low valley, where the fatneſs of the Lord's houſe is, where the greenneſs and ſafety is, where the ravenous beaſt cannot come. The feeding here is more than words; it is the end of all words and declarations. It is the end of the Lord, in ſending his meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the everlaſting goſpel among us; it is their crown and rejoicing to find us feeding in this low valley, where the Idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhepherds and their flocks cannot partake with us; they know not the way that leadeth thereto.</p>
            <p>The very remembrance of the time, wherein the call of the Lord reached us, and called us out of the holes of the rocks, and off the high hills and barren mountains, into the valley of <hi>Jehoſhaphat,</hi> where the pleading with all fleſh with fire and ſword is, and where the judgment is known, by which <hi>Sion</hi> is redeemed. I ſay the remembrance of this day is very precious to a remnant, and the miniſtration thereof was glorious in its time; but this is more glorious, to dwell in this low valley, where the green paſtures of life and ſalvation are fed on; where the growing is unto the ſtature and fulneſs of Chriſt; where no fear is; where the cauſe of it is taken away; where the pleaſant rivers run; where the tranquility of mind, peace and full ſatisfaction is enjoyed. This is the bleſſing of bleſſings, and the portion of a remnant in this the day of the Lord's love, and exceeding riches and kindneſs; and thoſe that truly enjoy the leaſt meaſure of it, eſteem it above all the world, becauſe they well know, that all things therein are not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to purchaſe the leaſt dram thereof.</p>
            <p n="39">XXXIX. It is a very bleſſed thing for every particular, within themſelves, to feel and know the ſpirit of God bear witneſs with their ſpirits, that <hi>they are true waiters upon and worſhipers of him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many glorious things, according to the teſtimony of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs, Prophets and Apoſtles, do accompany thoſe that wait upon the Lord, and are enjoyed by them. One could ſay, <hi>They that wait upon the Lord ſhall want no good thing.</hi> This one ſentence is ſufficient to try all the pretenders to wait upon the Lord in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who profeſs a waiting upon him in <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances,</hi> yet are found wanting <hi>the good thing.</hi> Poverty, blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and nakedneſs, leanneſs of ſoul and barrenneſs of heart, are their daily companions; ſo, inſtead of wanting no good thing, they want all good things relating to their inward man. Another could ſay, <hi>They that wait upon the Lord, their ſtrength ſhall be renewed, they ſhall mount upward as upon</hi> eagles <hi>wings,

            <p n="40">XL. It is a precious thing, to be witneſſes of the preſence of Jeſus in the midſt, <hi>as a peaceable Saviour;</hi> for thoſe that know him ſo, live, abide and walk in him, are of the number of thoſe which need no repentance. Indeed it is an high and heavenly ſtate to come to this degree of knowledge. None come hither, but ſuch who have firſt known him as a judge and reprover, as a refiner with conſuming fire, and as an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe are they, that come to ſing the ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Lamb,</hi> not only upon the banks of ſalvation, but in the midſt of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which comes down from God out of Heaven; and before the throne of the Lamb, who is the light thereof, and hath redeemed them from the earth, and faved them with a great ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="41">XLI. That which was loſt is now found; the <hi>precious pearl</hi> that was hid in the field, a remnant in this age hath digged deep and found it, and many rejoice in the ſight and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of; but let all underſtand this, that it is not ſufficient to find the heavenly treaſure, the precious pearl, but to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe it and poſſeſs it; even by ſelling all, parting with all for it. Nothing in our hearts, nothing in our eſteem, muſt ſtand in competition with it; all muſt be laid down for it. It is a true ſaying ſpoken by Jeſus, <hi>If any man love any thing more than me, he is not worthy of me.</hi> He alone muſt reign and rule, and have the government in our hearts. We muſt know him to be the foundation, corner and top-ſtone, elect and precious.</p>
            <p>It is not ſufficient to know him as a little ſtone cut out of the mountain without hands, ſmiting at the feet of all image<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;

This is the bleſſed ſtate of all, that have not only the knowledge of the field where the pearl is hid, but have alſo digged deep therein and found it, are to wait for and experience; and not to ſit down ſhort of this in the fight, knowledge and profeſſion of the precious pearl, but to purchaſe, inherit, poſſeſs and enjoy it; that they may be able to ſay, <hi>My beloved is mine and I am his;</hi> here is the feeding among the lillies, where there is neither toiling nor ſpinning.</p>
            <p n="42">XLII. That which makes a people bleſſed, above all the families of the earth, is, that they in their ſolemn aſſemblies, and at all times, are ſenſible of that power that <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <p>For the worſhip which this power hath led us to, begins not when our ſolemn aſſemblies begin, neither doth it end when we part, but is in that which is without beginning or end, even in the ſpirit and in the truth, into which the deceiver cannot come.</p>
            <p>It is a precious ſtate, an high and heavenly condition, to witneſs ſelf made of no reputation, and to have unity with that power that hath made it ſo. They that remain and abide in it, no temptation can prevail againſt. So the whole duty of thoſe that are come to the knowledge of this power, and to have faith in it, is always to cleave unto it with their whole hearts, and to fix their minds upon it; that in the midſt of all temptations and trials, they may witneſs deliverance and ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by it, and ſuch ſhall n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Such experience the bleſſedneſs that attends enduring temptation, and do magnify the power, over the power of the evil one, and walk to the praiſe and glory of it; and herein they differ from others; a

            <p>Self became of ſome repute, when temptation at firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered mankind; the giving credit to the devil's ſaying, <hi>You ſhall be as Gods,</hi> &amp;c. begot a ſelfiſh hope of a ſelfiſh gain; ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deceived, a vain deſire of ſelf reputation ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>This ſtate and knowledge is very glorious in its time, and is more than all the bare profeſſors in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> know or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand.

To live in the ſenſe and feeling of this healing virtue, this ſaving and preſerving power, not only in our ſolemn aſſemblies, but at other times, is very precious. This cureth all diſeaſes and inſirmities, and taketh away, diſperſeth and removeth the cauſe of hurts and wounds; the cauſe of ſmiting, convincing and reproving; and preſerving from falling into the ſame again; ſo as we live and abide in it, we can never err, nor ever need <hi>reproof, ſmiting</hi> or <hi>wounding.</hi> It is the world that lies in that ſtate, where the ſpirit of God convinceth for evil, reproveth, ſmiteth and woundeth for tranſgreſſion; but to us ſalvation is now nearer than when we firſt believed, and the great day of ſalvation is come; the maker up of the breach, and the healer of nations is come. bleſſed are all that do experience the healing virtue thereof, and the bleſſed effect of his appearing with heavenly healing under his wings; ſo that they can ſay, their <hi>ſoul-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is cured,</hi> and their <hi>wounds not only bound up, but healed,</hi> and they <hi>cleanſed and made ſound, both in ſoul, body and ſpirit.</hi> Such are fitted and prepared to have their converſation with God

            <p>It is the taſte of the rivers of pleaſure that are at his right-hand, and of the wine in his kingdom, that engageth thoſe that drink thereof, to wait to partake more and more of the ſame. It is <hi>becauſe of the ſavour of his good ointment, that the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins love him.</hi>

            <p>If there was no good ſavour, if there was not ſomething felt and witneſſed, of greater worth and value than the treaſures and pleaſures this world can afford, the ſouls of the righteous would not long after it, and become ſick of love, nor be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to wait to enjoy the increaſe and aboundings of it.</p>
            <p>In this ſtands our happineſs, <hi>daily to experience and partake</hi> of the virtue of this healing, ſaving and preſerving power, to feel our hearts and minds joined to it, united to it, become one with it. Herein is our everlaſting bleſſedneſs; and this truly diſtinguiſheth ſuch from all the bare proſeſſors in <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endom,</hi> even as they walk and abide in this bleſſed light, and ſun of righteouſneſs, that is riſen and now ſhineth, and in the witneſſing the healing virtue thereof.</p>
            <p n="44">XLIV. It is a precious ſtate to be of a <hi>tender ſpirit,</hi> of a <hi>ſoft heart,</hi> prepared <hi>to wait upon the Lord.</hi> Such are in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to know when <hi>good comes;</hi> they are not like the parched heath, nor barren deſert, but like the tender herb; they are ſenſible of the dews from Heaven, and of the gentle rain that falls, and the fruitful ſhowers that deſcend upon them; they can feel the droppings down of divine love, and ſprout forth and ſing for joy in the ſenſe thereof. But thoſe whoſe hearts are ſtony, and whoſe ſpirits are hard, they cannot taſte and ſee how good the Lord is; ſuch are not prepared to wait upon the Lord, nor to draw nigh unto him, and partake of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine refreſhments, neither have they the ſacrifice wherein his ſoul delights, which is <hi>a broken heart and contrite ſpirit.</hi> Oh! it is a bleſſed thing for people to meet together, and wait in the ſenſe and feeling of the tendering power of the Lord; even that power that ſought us out, and gathered us in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, to have our hearts exerciſed in this tendering power, which is now with us, and attends upon us, for our good and preſervation. This is that which makes us and our ſolemn aſſemblies differ from all the bare profeſſors of <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi> They that ſo meet and ſo wait, ſit as at the table of the Lord, feeding upon that which is meat indeed, and drinking of the wine that the hath prepared, feeding upon life itſelf, and the ſubſtance itſelf. This is better than to ſit at the table of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013006_0061_0F8FAB2527724C10"/>Princes; all the banquets and dainties of the earth are not to be compared to it. As every mind and heart keeps in the ſenſe of the tendering power of the Lord, they are living witneſſes of the preciouſneſs of it. Here none can forget the loving kindneſs of the Lord, nor let his benefits ſlip out of their minds; but are in a capacity to praiſe and magnify him for all his mercies and heavenly bleſſings, and wonderful kindneſſes and deliverances that he hath wrought for them, even as great as for any people in any age of the world. They can ſay, <hi>He hath not only brought them out of</hi> Egypt, <hi>through the red ſea and wilderueſs,</hi> but alſo <hi>into the good land,</hi> and hath <hi>divided their inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance unto them;</hi> and they can ſay, <hi>Their lot is fallen into a good place;</hi> feeling the ſlowing of the milk and honey, they eat and drink, and praiſe the Lord in the ſenſe of all his mercies, bleſſings and ſalvation that they are accompanied and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with.</p>
            <p>This is the myſtery of our fellowſhip, and the bond of our unity; as our minds and hearts are exerciſed in the tendering power of the Lord, eſpecially in our ſolemn meetings and waiting together upon him, as every one keeps cloſe unto this, and are united unto it. Oh! this is a precious ſtate, herein ſtands our bleſſed unity and fellowſhip, herein we are ſtrong, even as Mount <hi>Sion,</hi> as a three-fold cord that cannot eaſily be broken. As we keep and abide in this, the gates of hell can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prevail againſt us, no evil can hurt us. In this ſtands our joy and preſervation in our meetings, and in our partings, in all times and places, as we feel our hearts and minds in unity with the ſpirit of the Lord; then not convinced, reproved and condemned by it; but juſtified and commended. This is ſweet and precious indeed, as all that are in it know full well.</p>

            <p>It is thoſe that are witneſſes of a retiredneſs and a ſtayed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013006_0062_0F8FAB2648474728"/>of their minds upon the Lord, that inherit ſubſtance. It is thoſe that have known the candle of the Lord lighted in them, and have ſwept their own houſe, and found the piece of ſilver, and that rejoice therefore.</p>
            <p>This heavenly light that now ſhineth, diſcovereth the vanity and emptineſs of all things below the ſun; and by the ſame, our minds have been redeemed from under them, and are become living witneſſes, that neither all the treaſures, pleaſures, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and religions that are in the world, nor the bare pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of truth itſelf, was able or ſufficient to ſtay or ſatisfy our ſouls; We have found them all prove a very vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</p>
            <p>For the ſoul of man is in itſelf more excellent, more noble, and of greater value than all theſe things, and is ſuperior to them all. The leſſer cannot ſatisfy or fill the greater; nor that which is inſerior, ignoble and leſs excellent, ſtay or ſatisfy that which is ſuperior or more worthy, noble and excellent in nature, capacity and being. As the ſoul of mankind is above all created ſublunary beings, therefore <hi>all things under the ſun, inſtead of food and ſatisfaction unto it, prove vanity, emptineſs and vexation of ſpirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So bleſſed is the remembrance of that day and time, wherein our minds were turned to the true everlaſting light that now ſhineth, which hath diſcovered the vanity and nothingneſs of all things below the ſun, and hath redeemed the children thereof from under them all, up unto him who is in them, through them, and above them all, God bleſſed forever. And brings into the one true everlaſting univerſal worſhip, which ſtands in the ſpirit and in the truth. Here God who is light, and dwells in the light, is bowed unto, worſhipped and obeyed.</p>

            <p n="47">XLVII.

            <p>This day is the day of the great ſabbath, in which Chriſt ſtands up as a teacher of his people, and they hear and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his voice, and follow him, and ſhut their ear againſt the many voices that are in the world. This is the teacher we
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013006_0064_0F8FAB2778BC17F8"/>have been directed to from the beginning. We have not been called to a noiſe or ſound of words, nor to a bare profeſſion; but to inherit ſubſtance, to enjoy reſt, even that reſt which hath been prepared of old, for the people of God, <hi>and which doth remain,</hi> and is very glorious, as thoſe that have entered into it can witneſs: And this is my experience and teſtimony, That none can enter into this reſt, but as they know a ceaſing from their own works, their own willing, running and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and every thought brought into the obedience of Chriſt; no further than this is effected, can any entrance be witneſſed by any into this reſt that is <hi>prepared,</hi> and that doth <hi>remain,</hi> let people's talk and profeſſion be what it will.</p>

This is witneſſed by a remnant in this age, as in ages paſt; for the day of life and ſalvation is come, and the bleſſed way that leadeth thereto is known, and evidently made manifeſt to thouſands in this our own native country, and iſland of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> on whom the glory of the Lord is riſen.</p>
            <p>It is a bleſſed thing to know the way of life and ſalvation, but it is more bleſſed, and a greater degree of happineſs, for every particular, to whom it hath appeared, to know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves fitted and prepared, by walking in the light thereof, <hi>to poſſeſs and inherit the ſame.</hi> This is that which is worthy to be
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013006_0065_0F8FAB2835FD5D88"/>waited for, and is the bleſſed end of all holy writing, reading, preaching and believing, even to poſſeſs the thing read, writ and preached of. Such as are taught of the Lord, and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in righteouſneſs, not only know it, and profeſs it, but are eſtabliſhed in it. This is the mark of the high calling, which all that are but in the way that leadeth thereto, are to preſs after, that they may come to the enjoyment thereof.</p>
            <p>It is the taſting and ſeeing how good the Lord is, that raiſeth and quickeneth deſires to enjoy him, and more and more enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth to draw nigh unto him, and to wait upon him. It is the taſting of the ſtreams of the river of life and pleaſure that is at the right-hand of God, that alone reneweth ſtrength; and ſuch only are witneſſes of the truth of that ſaying, <hi>They that wait upon the Lord ſhall renew their ſtrength, and mount upward as upon the wings of an eagle, run without wearineſs, and walk without fainting,</hi> even in the way of God's commandments with delight; being become more natural and pleaſant ſo to do, than ever it was to do the contrary.</p>
            <p>This is the bleſſed ſtate and priviledge of many, to draw ſo nigh unto the Lord, as that they not only taſte and ſee the goodneſs of the Lord, but are alſo filled and ſatisfied with the renewings of ſtrength, divine refreſhments, and heavenly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation in their ſouls, whereby they are made more and more in love with him, and engaged continually to wait upon him. And in this ſtands the happineſs and preſervation of all, even as the eye of their minds is kept looking unto the Lord, and waiting upon him, even as the eye of a maid is upon the hand of her miſtreſs, and much more. Where this taſting, ſeeing, drawing and waiting is wanting, weakneſs, wearineſs and fainting abounds, and the enemy of their ſoul prevails, let the talk and profeſſion of religion be what it will.</p>
            <p n="50">L. It is a bleſſing, yea, the bleſſing of all bleſſings, for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry particular to know and feel within themſelves, that <hi>the ſpirit of God hears witneſs with their ſpirits,</hi> that <hi>they are the ſons and daughters of God,</hi> that <hi>they are begotten by him to a lively hope;</hi> whereby <hi>they purify themſelves even as he is pure,</hi> and that they are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> indeed, <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, in whom is no guile. This I ſay is the bleſſing of all bleſſings, for every one to have the ſpirit of God to witneſs thoſe things unto them; and this is precious to wait for and enjoy; for he that hath called us is holy, harmleſs and without guile; ſo as we follow and obey him, we ſhall be like him, as the primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were, who ſaid, <hi>We know that when be doth appear we ſhall be like him.</hi> This teſtimony of the ſpirit of God is more than a

            <p>It is good to mind the ſpirit and its teſtimony, ſo as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſpiritually-minded; then life and peace is known, and death and trouble vaniſheth away, and the truth of that ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is witneſſed, <hi>To be ſpiritually-minded is life and peace, but to be carnally-minded is death.</hi>

In this ſtands the everlaſting joy, peace, comfort and conſolation of the righteous, even as they continually learn of the ſpirit of grace, and are witneſſes of the leading of it, and guidance of it, out of all evil into all good.

            <p n="51">LI. It is a precious thing to <hi>wait, walk, and dwell in the light,</hi> even in that which makes all things manifeſt; and thoſe that wait and walk in it, are led by it to the riſing of the Son, even the everlaſting Son of righteouſneſs, whoſe glory, light and virtue, doth as really diſperſe and drive away the vain thoughts, dark imaginations, fogs, clouds and miſts of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and darkneſs within, as the outward ſun doth expel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh,

            </p>
            <p>The very remembrance of the firſt diſcovery of truth under this name <hi>Light,</hi> in this our age, is very precious. The truth is but one, but it hath many names; and this name <hi>Light,</hi> to a remnant, is very excellent. Many righteous men and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, in former ages, foretold of the glory of this day, or <hi>Light</hi> that now ſhineth, and propheſied of its-breaking forth unto a people that ſat in darkneſs, and that were covered with the ſhadow of the night, and dwelt in the region of death. We ſee the fulfilling of theſe things; for we ſat in darkneſs, and wandered in deſolate places, and were encompaſſed with the region and ſhadow of death. Oh! how ſweet was the light when it firſt ſprang unto us, and cauſed us to ſee over the tops of the high mountains of darkneſs, and diſcovered unto us the ſecret chambers of imagery, and the hidden things of darkneſs, and guided our feet out of the mine and clay, and ſet them at liberty, to walk in that path which leadeth out of the way of death and darkneſs.</p>
            <p>This is that manifeſtation of light, by which all theſe things are effected, to which our minds were at firſt turned; which light judgeth every appearance of evil, and leadeth all, that walk in it, out the ſame. This is the path-way, that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leadeth into innocency, but preſerveth in it; for there is a poſſibility in this age as of old, that people may loſe a good ſtate, be tempted out of innocency and a virgin's ſtate, after they have attained unto it. This made <hi>Paul</hi> exhort thoſe he wrote to, <hi>To beware leſt the ſerpent beguiled them as he did</hi> Eve. <hi>How was that?</hi> Why, draw or allure them out of innocency, out of harmleſsneſs and a ſinleſs ſtate, into ſin or breach of God's commandments, to the loſs of Paradiſe. This he hath done, and may do again. People may loſe a good ſtate, yea, their place in Paradiſe, if not watchful; therefore good is it to wait and watch in the light, which not only leadeth into the garden of God again, and bringeth to the tree of life, and gives right to eat thereof, but alſo preſerveth in the ſame; diſcovers and gives dominion over the tempter, and keepeth from falling into the temptation.</p>
            <p>It is no wonder to us, why the old enemy of mankind rageth againſt the truth, under this name <hi>Light;</hi> and that he gives it ſo many approbrious and deſpicable names, that people might not regard it, nor believe in it <hi>as it is;</hi> knowing that it under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines his kingdom of darkneſs, and diſcovers him and all his works, and deſtroys them alſo. We are witneſſes of the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and virtue of faith in the <hi>Light,</hi> that it is able to break all
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013006_0068_0F8FB1CA2FFA2A60"/>the chains of darkneſs, and deliver out of the fetters of death and hell; and we alſo know, that there is not any other way or means under Heaven appointed of God, that is able to effect this work. All other ways, means and inventions of men, are not able to break one link of the chains of darkneſs. 'Tis faith in Chriſt the <hi>Light,</hi> which reproveth the world of ſin. Though this light ſhines in the world in wicked men in darkneſs, yet they having not faith in it, believing not in it, as that in which God dwells, they never know the ſaving power and virtue thereof; yet its reproving and condemning power ſuch ſhall not eſcape.</p>
            <p n="52">LII. It is a bleſſed thing, for People <hi>to know the name of the Lord,</hi> even as ſome in ages paſt knew it, and have left their knowledge and experience upon record; who could ſay and witneſs, that <hi>the name of the Lord</hi> was as a <hi>buckler,</hi> as a <hi>ſhield,</hi> as a <hi>tower of defence,</hi> yea, as a <hi>ſtrong tower,</hi> into which the righteous fled and were ſafe. It is very precious for people ſo to know the name of the Lord, and to meet together in it; ſuch are in a capacity to enjoy, poſſeſs and inherit all the <hi>bleſſings</hi> that ever were promiſed, and to avoid and eſcape all the <hi>curſes</hi> that were ever threatned.</p>
            <p>The glorious light of the goſpel, that now ſhineth, is the <hi>name of the Lord,</hi> whereby he hath made himſelf manifeſt to us in this our day and age. As we wait together, and walk in this name, we are witneſſes and experiencers of the fulfilling of that promiſe, <hi>Where two or three are met together in my name, there am I in the midſt;</hi> ſuch know their teacher, their Saviour, in the midſt, and their eye is towards him, and their ear open to his voice, who is a teacher, one of a thouſand, who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to profit indeed. Many, that have learned of him, can ſay, <hi>They ſoon became wiſer than all their former teachers.</hi> Thus to hear and learn of him is the bleſſed end of all preaching, hearing and believing; and of all the ordinances, miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, diſpenſations and appointments of God, ever ſince the fall of man, even to <hi>hear and obey the voice of the Son of God,</hi> who is light, and dwells in the light, wherein the righteous in all ages had fellowſhip with God, and one with another.</p>
            <p>To know this <hi>name,</hi> is more than talk and a bare profeſſion. To know it as a ſafe hiding place, a ſure rock, and tower of defence when the enemy aſſaults, when floods of temptations attend, when arrows fly by night, and ceaſe not in the day; when ſtorms deſcend, and winds blow. This was and is the bleſſed end of the knowledge of the <hi>name</hi> of the Lord in all ages, to ſave and preſerve them that <hi>have</hi> it, from all dangers that attend them at all times and in all places, from the enemy

            <p>This was the reaſon why thoſe that knew it, compared it to a <hi>ſtrong tower,</hi> &amp;c. They often meditated in it, and thought upon the name of the Lord, and thereby found ſtrength to <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from every appearance of evil,</hi> and to reſiſt the devil in all his attempts. This is a happy ſtate indeed, which thoſe only that know the name of the Lord, and can truſt it, do enjoy.</p>
            <p>By this may all the bare profeſſors of all the various names in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> ſo called, be proved and tried; who talk much and profeſs much, of the name of the Lord, but do not <hi>depart from iniquity, do not ceaſe from evil,</hi> do not know his name as a <hi>ſtrong tower,</hi> to ſave and preſerve them from the ſtrength and power of the enemy of their ſouls; ſo notwithſtanding their great profeſſion of the name of the Lord, they do <hi>not depart from iniquity;</hi> and though they take his name into their mouths, they <hi>hate to be reformed by him;</hi> which is a great abomination to the Lord, and ſtinks in his noſtrils. For this I teſtify in the name of the Lord, that all people upon the face of the earth, let their name and ſort of religion be what it will, who profeſs the name of the Lord, and are found in <hi>evil doing,</hi> their profeſſion is vain, and their religion a lye. In ſin they live, and in ſin they will die, except they come to know that repentance which is never to be repented of; till which, they can never come to know the name of the Lord as a <hi>ſtrong tower, buckler or ſhield;</hi> but are led captive and enſnared by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of their ſouls, even at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p n="53">LIII. In this ſtands our bleſſedneſs and everlaſting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as our eye is kept always looking to Jeſus, the author and finiſher of our faith, and not only to know him the <hi>author,</hi> the <hi>beginner</hi> of faith, but the <hi>finiſher,</hi> the <hi>ender</hi> alſo; to know the end of faith, which is the <hi>ſalvation of our ſouls;</hi> ſuch know ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation nearer than when they firſt believed. It is a bleſſed thing, to have and know that ſaith which Jeſus is the author of, the leaſt meaſure of which, is very precious and very pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful; though it be but as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, it removes mountains, and doth wonderful things. Many are living wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes;ſes in this age, as in ages paſt, of the power of faith, even in the beginning of its work; but it is an higher ſtate to know the end of it, the finiſhing of it, to know the work thereof done; to know the heart purified by it, and the victory over the world obtained; the wicked one ſubdued and overcome, brought down and deſtroyed. This is a bleſſed ſtate indeed, and that which all are to wait for, preſs after and witneſs.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:013006_0070_0F8FB1CDAF1BE408"/>The only way to attain it, is always to look to Jeſus, to keep the eye of the mind toward him, and the ear open to him, who alone teacheth to profit, even <hi>in ſilence,</hi> when no word is ſpoken outwardly. This is the bleſſed end of the miniſtry and miniſters of truth the Lord hath ſent amongſt us, and of all preaching, writing and printing, even that every one's eye might be turned to Jeſus, always looking to him who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the good work, and who alone is able to finiſh it.</p>
            <p n="54">LIV. It is a bleſſed ſtate, to be <hi>as a ſtranger and pilgrim on the earth,</hi> and to be able to ſay in truth, as ſome of old did, <hi>We have here no continuing city, but we ſeek one to come.</hi> I ſay, this is a bleſſed ſtate; but it is more bleſſed to find the city ſought for, to know the heavenly city to be come, to know the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> come down from above, from God out of Heaven, and to be a citizen of it; ſuch dwell in a quiet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation; ſuch are redeemed from the earth, who dwell in this heavenly city, where no unclean thing can enter; they dwell not upon the earth, neither do they inhabit the dark corners thereof, where the woe and miſery is, as it is written, <hi>Woe to them that dwell upon the earth: Woe to the inhabitants of the earth, for the devil is come down amongſt you,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>The outward <hi>Jew,</hi> the outward <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the outward <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> the outward furniture thereof, and the worſhips and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers therein, were ſhadows, figures and types of theſe things. <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was the place of worſhip, and all were to repair thither to worſhip, to make their offerings, and offer their ſacrifices; and wherever the people were, when they prayed or worſhipped, they were to turn their faces towards the city of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> To be witneſſes of the coming down of the heavenly city of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and being a fellow citizen of the ſaints in light, is the antitype and ſubſtance of thoſe things, and of all the bleſſed promiſes relating thereunto, and is that which all are to wait for, who have not attained thereto, but are in the way thereof.</p>
            <p n="55">LV. It is a true ſaying recorded in the holy ſcriptures, that
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:013006_0071_0F8FB1CDF4100C78"/>the <hi>Word is nigh, in the mouth, and in the heart; none need to aſcend or deſcend to fetch it down, or bring it up.</hi> This was the word of faith preached and believed by the primitive <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and is now again preached and believed in by a remnant in this age. Bleſſed are all thoſe that know, experience and abide in the ſame, that hear and obey the voice and teachings thereof, that are learning of it, not only when they meet together in one place, but at other times and places, in their common occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to lend their ear unto it, and receive its inſtruction. Such aſſuredly will be made wiſe unto ſalvation. Such will not be always learning, and never learned; neither will they be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with ſin, not be led about by divers luſts, but will witneſs the powerful ſalvation of God through faith in the word, <hi>which is quick, ſharp and powerful;</hi> quick to teach and inſtruct in all that is good; and to reprove and condemn all that is evil; and ſharp and powerful to cut down and deſtroy that which did formerly load with ſin, and led into the things that are evil.</p>
            <p>The hearing and obeying this word of life, this inſpeaking word of God, that is nigh in the mouth and in the heart, is the only ground of all true learning and knowledge; and all that deſpiſe the voice of it, and ſhut their ears againſt the teachings of it, and have not faith in it, though they may be furniſhed with all the academical learning in the world, and be diligent hearkeners to the voice of men and books, yet will they remain ſtrangers to, and ignorant of the pure ſanctifying, ſatisfying wiſdom, and peaceable ſalvation of God, and under the burden and power of ſin, under the command of their luſts, wills and paſſions.</p>
            <p>The want of faith in the word and power of God within, and the neglect of hearing the ſtill ſmall voice thereof, is the ground and cauſe of all ignorance, errors, darkneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion among men, of all ſects and ſorts of religion upon the face of the whole earth.</p>
            <p n="56">LVI. It is a precious thing to <hi>have faith,</hi> and to be <hi>always looking unto Jeſus the author and finiſher of it;</hi> and to be <hi>growing and increaſing in it, from one degree unto another.</hi> They are the bleſſed people who wait, walk and live together in this faith, which Jeſus is the author of; and is the ſame which was once delivered to the ſaints; being <hi>the gift of God,</hi> and not of man. The leaſt meaſure of which is very powerful, though but as a grain of muſtard ſeed, it is able to remove mountains; and all that know the growing and increaſe of it, and perſevere therein, come to know <hi>Jeſus</hi> not only the <hi>author,</hi> but the <hi>finiſher

            <p>Let all the ſects in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who talk of having faith in God, try and examine <hi>what their faith hath done for them.</hi> If it hath not removed mountains of darkneſs and ignorance; if it hath not purified their hearts; if it hath not given them victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry over the world, ſaved them out of the evil thereof, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled them to pleaſe God, to live unto him, and to find accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him; if they know not theſe things wrought in them and for them, they may infallibly conclude <hi>their faith is dead,</hi> and is none of that faith which is the gift of God, once delivered to, and received by the primitive ſaints, which Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus was the author of; but is a faith of their own making, and is like the faith of devils who <hi>believe and tremble;</hi> the only fruit and effect of the faith of devils and wicked men.</p>

It is a bleſſed thing to know and witneſs <hi>a meeting and waiting together in the name of Jeſus;</hi> ſuch as meet in this name, and know Jeſus the peaceable Saviour in the midſt of them, know the heavenly adorning of a meek and quiet ſpirit, the prince of peace, and his peaceable government, the Lamb upon the throne, the righteous bearing rule, the land rejoicing, and heavenly peace in their borders.</p>
            <p>It is the true waiters and meeters in this name, that enjoy all the bleſſings promiſed. It is they that know their ſtrength, faith and confidence in God renewed; their wiſdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge encreaſed with the encreaſe of God; they know the light to ſhine more and more unto a perfect day, as was wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed of old, <hi>The juſt man's path is as a ſhining light, that ſhineth more and more unto a perfect day.</hi>

Judgment begins at the houſe of God, to purge away and ſweep out all that doth defile, and to lay waſte <hi>Babylon,</hi> the city of confuſion, the myſtery of iniquity.

As in this name we meet and abide, we feel the kingdom come, and the will of God done; and whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver we aſk in this name, we receive, according to Chriſt's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; for we have not been called to a ſound of words, to
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013006_0073_0F8FB1CF833A0CC0"/>figures, types and ſhadows, nor to depend upon the lips of others, though enabled to make long declarations of the truth itſelf; but to inherit ſubſtance, to feel Jeſus the truth in the midſt, the tree of life in the midſt, and to eat of the fruit thereof, and to ſit under his ſhadow with great delight. Theſe things are a remnant come unto, and do enjoy. This is the crown and rejoicing of the meſſengers and miniſters of the Lord, when they come among us, to find us feeding on the bread of life; enjoying and poſſeſſing ſubſtance, peace, life, and everlaſting ſalvation: And it is their ſorrow and trouble to find a people under the profeſſion of truth, always learning, but never learned; always hearing, and yet ignorant of the voice of the word of life in themſelves, and of that living bread which comes down from Heaven.</p>
            <p n="58">LVIII. To them that believe, Chriſt <hi>is precious,</hi> even him whom the nations deſpiſe, and the maſter-builders ſet at nought: I ſay, to thoſe that believe he is precious, he is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the head of the corner. They love him in all his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances, manifeſtations, diſpenſations and operations; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he appears as a judge, a convincer, a reprover, a refiner with fire, and a fuller with ſoap; or a comforter; ſaviour, or prince of peace. In all theſe he is precious to thoſe that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him, becauſe they know and believe, that the bleſſed end of every appearance and operation of his ſpirit in them, is in order to make them happy.</p>
            <p>It is very bleſſed to know him appear as a judge, a reprover, a refiner and fuller, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is more than a bare profeſſion, and beyond all the nominal <hi>Chriſtians</hi> upon the face of the earth; but it is much more bleſſed to know him a finiſher of the work, to know judgment brought forth to victory, to know a being refined, a being purified, a being ſanctified and ſaved. This is a ſtate that every believer is to wait for and experience; without which, they cannot be <hi>Chriſtians</hi> indeed, <hi>Iſraelites</hi> indeed, in whom is no guile.</p>
            <p>For this I teſtify, That this is the end of the bleſſed appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Son of God, the <hi>Light, Grace, Spirit, Power</hi> or <hi>Love</hi> of God <hi>within;</hi> which is all one thing, though under different names, ſo to work and operate in every true believer in him, and lover of him as to make an end of ſin, finiſh tranſgreſſion, and bring in everlaſting righteouſneſs. This is the bleſſed end of all his operations.</p>
            <p>The titular <hi>Chriſtian</hi> that talks of Chriſt and his offices, as King, Prieſt and Prophet, Saviour and Redeemer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and knows him not firſt as a refiner, a fuller, as a purger of the floor, and a burner of the chaff with unquenchable fire, deceives his
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013006_0074_0F8FB1D043085E00"/>own ſoul with a vain talk and profeſſion; ſo never witneſſeth ſin made an end of, nor tranſgreſſion finiſhed, nor everlaſting righteouſneſs brought in. Except this be known, all profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is vain, and people cheat themſelves with the name <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> the nature therof being wanting.</p>
            <p>It is very precious and abſolutely needful, for every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular that profeſſeth the name of Chriſt, and faith that he is a believer in him, to feel and know his heart and mind truly in love with every appearance of him in his ſoul; to follow it and obey it, and to enjoy the end thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Everlaſting ſalvation brought in, ſin made an end of, that he may appear the ſecond time without ſin unto ſalvation. This is worthy to be waited for; and as every one loves the appearance of Chriſt, and joins to it in their hearts, againſt every appearance of evil, they are in the way that leadeth thereto, even to everlaſting life, peace and ſalvation. This is the new and living way, and there is not another. All that are out of this way, are ſtrangers to it in their minds, their hearts being ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated from it, never come to inherit ſubſtance, nor to know everlaſting righteouſneſs brought in, unrighteouſneſs finiſhed and caſt forth, the houſe ſwept, purged and cleanſed, and they made an habitation for God in the ſpirit, but do remain as a cage for unclean birds, and a place for dragons; though they may talk of the fame of wiſdom, ſanctification and redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, righteouſneſs and ſalvation, yet they are found in the contrary; in captivity and bondage, though they talk of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and redemption; in unholineſs and corruption, while they talk of ſactification and righteouſneſs. <hi>Let all concerned conſider hereof.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="59">LIX. It is a bleſſed thing for people to meet together in one place <hi>with one accord, all minding one thing,</hi> every mind <hi>exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the ſpirit and in the truth,</hi> wherein alone God is worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. This is the worſhip a remnant are brought unto, which worſhip doth not always begin when their ſolemn meetings begin, neither doth it end when they part. It is as every one is found therein, that they and their worſhip differ from all the formal worſhippers upon the face of the whole earth, whoſe worſhip ſtands in the traditions and inventions of men, in ſet times, and at certain places, in ſaying certain prayers, reading divers leſſons, preaching and ſinging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Every mind being exerciſed in the truth, every thing that is contruy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, is made to bow and bend unto it; every thought, every imagination, every deſire and affection made ſubject to the truth, worſhipping or bowing to the name of Jeſus. This is more than bowing the knee, or all bodily exerciſe whatſoever;
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:013006_0075_0F8FB1D12AF665D8"/>more than all <hi>Mountain</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> worſhip, of all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers modes in <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> For while the <hi>mind</hi> is carnally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, the <hi>heart</hi> corrupt, the <hi>conſcience</hi> defiled, the <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> darkened; all is but will-worſhip, ſelf-work, and voluntary humility, and hath no acceptance with God.</p>
            <p n="60">LX. It is a true ſaying which Chriſt ſpoke to his diſciples, when he ſaid, <hi>If I go not away, the Comforter will not come.</hi> There is much in the words; many have read them, but have not underſtood what they read; for it is a bleſſed thing, to know the going away of Chriſt after the fleſh, and to be able to ſay, as one of old did, <hi>Know I him ſo no more.</hi> They are thoſe that know him come again in the ſpirit as a comforter, as a Prince of peace, and are witneſſes or his peaceable government in their ſouls, and can ſay, <hi>He is come, and we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ook not for another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="61">LXI. Of a truth, the times of <hi>refreſhing</hi> are come from the preſence of the Lord, the <hi>ſhowers</hi> from Heaven are falling, and the <hi>heavenly manna</hi> is rained down, and many are livingly refreſhed therewith, and are become as a well watered gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: Who were as a deſert and wilderneſs, are now bloſſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a roſe; and thoſe that were barren, now bear and bring forth fruit unto God. This is the Lord's doing, and is marvellous in the eyes of a remnant.</p>
            <p>Bleſſed are the people that can meet together with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and ſit before the Lord waiting upon him. Such at times are favoured to ſit as at a banquet, and have a table richly ſpread before them; they eat and drink and their ſouls are ſatisfied. Their everlaſting happineſs and bleſſedneſs ſtands in this; in feeling their hearts and minds continually drawn nigh unto the Lord, and ſtaid upon him, not only in their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn meetings, but at other times. In this they are preſerved in a capacity to partake of the mercies and bleſſings of the Lord daily. This is a bleſſed and ſafe ſtate indeed; to know a ſtay to the mind, to know the heart fixed, joined, ſettled upon the Lord. Such cannot be eaſily moved, neither can the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my prevail againſt ſuch, nor the ſtranger intermeddle with their joy. Their bread is ſure, and their water fails not. They are witneſſes of the truth of that Prophet's words, who ſaid, ſpeaking of the Lord, <hi>Thou wilt keep them in perfect peace whoſe minds are ſtaid upon thee.</hi> What can any deſire more than perfect peace? Peace that is intire, wanting nothing, full of ſatisfaction, and rejoicing in the inward man. Oh! what would a remnant have given in times paſt, to have known a ſtay to their minds, to have known the heavenly treaſure which is ſufficient to ſatisfy, refreſh and conſolate their ſouls! This is the pearl of great price. This is the eating of the tree
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013006_0076_0F8FB1D1AF2A47A0"/>of life indeed, and is the only way and means to come to the poſſeſſion of all the treaſures of wiſdom and knowledge that lie hid in Chriſt Jeſus, and to inherit all the bleſſings that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> religion we profeſs; but thoſe that are of a wandering mind, their thoughts, wills and affections unſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unmortified, they are in that ſtate wherein they know not when good comes, and as broken ciſterns that can hold no water.</p>
            <p>So this is the main thing, wherein our ſafety and happineſs ſtands, <hi>viz.</hi> to know our minds and hearts drawn nigh unto the Lord, our eye fixed upon him: that after we have partook of his bleſſings, and been refreſhed with his preſence, we may abide in a frame of mind, ready to receive of him that which doth ſatisfy our ſouls, and miniſter true content to our minds. Nothing is able thus to do, but the daily bread. What we eat to-day, will not ſerve to-morrow. <hi>Give us this day our daily bread.</hi> Bread every day freſh from the table of the Lord. Hereby is the growing from grace to grace, from faith to faith, from one degree of glory unto another witneſſed, even till we all come unto the ſtature and fulneſs of Chriſt. The more any thus truly wait to enjoy, the more they feel their ſtrength re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed with heavenly encouragement, ſo that they can <hi>run and not be weary,</hi> and <hi>walk and not be faint.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="62">LXII. That which makes a people bleſſed and happy, is, <hi>that they hear and obey</hi> the ſtill ſmall voice, which ſaith, <hi>This is the way, walk in it.</hi> This is the voice of the true ſhepherd, and the ſheep know it, follow it and obey it, and a ſtranger they will not hear not follow. In this lay the ſafety, ſtrength and bleſſedneſs of the righteous, in all ages and generations paſt, even in hearing and obeying the voice of the Lord. Herein they gained victory over their enemies, and knew them all confounded and brought to nought. This is the ſtrength and bleſſedneſs of the righteous in this age and generation, by which they overcome their enemies. As we hear and obey this voice, we grow ſtrong and prevail againſt all our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, even thoſe of our own houſe, which are our greateſt enemies. In obeying this heavenly voice, which calls out of all the crooked ways and bye-paths of ſin and tranſgreſſion, into the ſtrait and living way of the Lord, and preſerveth in the ſame, that we return not into them again, that we enter not into the way of ſin and tranſgreſſion, that we are not captivated in the way of darkneſs and error, out of which we have been called, and from which we have been redeemed and ſaved with a great ſalvation. Praiſes be to the name of the Lord, who hath cauſed his glorious day to
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013006_0077_0F8FB1D451088CC8"/>dawn, and his heavenly voice to be heard and known, from all the voices that are in the world, and from the voice of the ſerpent, though it many times ſpeaks very low and ſmall.

But no people nor perſon upon the face of the earth, can witneſs theſe things effected in them, but as they travel through the work of regeneration, and come to know that their Redeemer liveth not only in himſelf, but alſo in them. Then tranſgreſſion is known to be finiſhed, and everlaſting righteouſneſs brought in. Then the Prince of peace and righteouſneſs reigns, ſits upon the throne and rules; where the prince of the power of the air and unrighteouſneſs did rule. Then doth the land rejoice, and heavenly peace abounds in their dwellings; which peace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be enjoyed by any, let them profeſs what they will, tho' it be the truth itſelf, unleſs they experimentally know their Teacher, their Saviour, their Redeemer.</p>
            <p n="64">LXIV. The very remembrance of the time, wherein our minds were turned <hi>to the true light that now ſhineth,</hi> not only in darkneſs, but out of it, is very precious; in which God <hi>dwells,</hi> in which we are living witneſſes of his <hi>preſence</hi> and <hi>appearance,</hi> which miniſtreth more conſolation, refreſhment and gladneſs in our hearts, than the increaſe of corn, wine and oil. The
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:013006_0078_0F8FB1D5188223B0"/>exceeding love and kindneſs of God, in fitting and preparing inſtruments in his own hand, and by his own power, to turn and direct our minds to the light of Chriſt within, to the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of God within, is never to be forgotten. The waiting in which, and the obedience to which, makes us and our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to differ from thoſe who are ſtrangers thereunto; the which, as we wait in and obey, we never have our teacher to ſeek, our guide and inſtructor to ſeek, though no word be ſpoken outwardly.</p>
            <p>It is a precious thing to love this light, and to walk in it. That is the only way to be a child of it. It is the high-way that was propheſied ſhould <hi>be caſt up, wherein the way-faring man, though a fool, ſhould not err.</hi> There is no ſtumbling in this way, nor <hi>no occaſion of ſtumbling.</hi> As we walk and abide therein, we are, and ſhall be the moſt contented people, the wiſeſt, ſtrongeſt and happieſt people upon the face of the earth: but out of it, we are as weak as any; and after we are come to the knowledge of this way, if we abide not therein, we may alſo become as wicked as any.</p>
            <p>There is no other way to be looked for, no other goſpel to be preached than this, to which our minds were turned at the beginning, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Grace and Power of God,</hi> the <hi>Pearl,</hi> the <hi>Treaſure,</hi> the <hi>Kingdom within;</hi> in which the key is known, that openeth not only the myſteries of godlineſs, but the myſtery of iniquity alſo; and brings our eye to be ſatisfied with ſeeing, our ear with hearing, and our heart with under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
            <p>Oh! how are we engaged to walk in this way! to walk worthy of this love which is ſhed abroad in our hearts, which we are made partakers of, that we may adorn our profeſſion with all holineſs of life and converſation; to the praiſe of him that hath called us out of darkneſs into his marvelous light. To whom be glory forever.</p>
            <p n="65">LXV. It is a bleſſed thing, to know <hi>the kingdom of God to be come,</hi> even the ſame kingdom which Chriſt long ſince taught his diſciples to pray for; and which he in this age hath taught his diſciples to pray for. It is a bleſſed thing to know this kingdom to be come, but it is more bleſſed to know a ſitting down in it, and partaking of that wherein it ſtands, <hi>viz. Peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt;</hi> which all the kingdoms of this world cannot give, nor take away.</p>
            <p>Now the cauſe why we in time paſt, as well as others, were ignorant of the coming of this kingdom, and wanted the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of that wherein it ſtands, was becauſe we diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its appearance, and over-looked the ſeed of it, and ſlighted
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:013006_0079_0F8FB1D583A3B3A0"/>the operation of it; which is like the working of leaven in meal. This was the cauſe, even becauſe we did not regard the day of ſmall things; we had no faith in the holy power and ſpiritual appearance of God within, which always wrought againſt evil, and the author of it, and his kingdom of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, though but as a little leaven or ſmall ſeed.</p>
            <p>And all the ſects and ſect-maſters in <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look the ſeed of the kingdom, which works like leaven in all that have ſaith in it, and deſpiſe the appearance and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the light and ſpirit of God within, the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> never know the coming of the kingdom of God, nor the ſitting down in it. They inherit vanity, reap ſorrow, and lie down in miſery, let their talk and profeſſion be never ſo high. <hi>This is the wora of truth to them all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But all that know the coming of this kingdom, and a ſitting down in it, and the enjoyment of that wherein it ſtands, which is peace and joy in the Holy Ghoſt; they are living witneſſes of their being gathered from the eaſt, weſt, north and ſouth, and of ſitting down with <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> in the kingdom of God, and can ſay as ſome of old could, which the author to the <hi>Hebrews</hi> wrote to, when he ſaid. <hi>But ye are come unto Mount</hi> Sion, <hi>and unto the ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y of the living God; the heavenly</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born, which are written in Heaven; and to God the Judge of all, and to the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect; and to Jeſus the mediator of the new covenant; and to the blood of ſprinkling, that ſpeakerb better things than the blood of</hi> Abel. Were not theſe things written in the holy Scriptures, it might or would be counted unlawful, if not blaſphemy, to ſpeak or write after this manner. But the kingdom and power of God is one and the ſame throughout all ages, and was the dwelling-place of the righteous in all generations; even the ſame our minds were at firſt turned and directed to, whoſe firſt appearance was as a <hi>light</hi> ſhining in a dark place; as a <hi>little ſeed</hi> ſpringing out of a dry ground; as a <hi>little leaven</hi> work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the meal, according to the parables and teachings of Chriſt Jeſus. This was the lot and inheritance which the holy men and holy women in ages paſt waited for and received, and glorified and praiſed God for the enjoyment thereof, in the midſt of all afflictions and fiery trials, and over them all. This was their joy and crown, and the righteous in this age deſire no other.</p>
            <p n="66">LXVI. We have been and are called to <hi>inherit ſubſtance;</hi> and all that have obeyed this call, and abode with him that

To meet together, and ſit together at this table, and eat of this bread, is better than to ſit on thrones with Princes, and to eat of their dainties. All the treaſures and pleaſures of this world, are not to be compared with it; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing able to content the ſoul, and to ſtop its hungering and thirſting after thoſe things that periſh with the uſing, but the eating of this bread: And the more any eat of this bread, the more they hunger after it. There is a pleaſure and bleſſing in hungering and thirſting, when the treaſury of living bread and water is ready at hand to ſupply; and it is the taſte of the crumbs which fall from the children's table, that begets a cry in the hearts of a remnant, <hi>Evermore give us this bread.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="67">LXVII. Bleſſed are all who have their eye unto the Lord, and their ear open unto him at all times, and in all places, and in all ſtates and conditions; for of a truth, <hi>God is come to teach his people himſelf,</hi> as was long ſince foretold. All that have learned of him, and are guided by his ſpirit, are thereby led to within the vail, into the holieſt of holies, and know the vail to be taken away, not only the vail of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the vail of the outward <hi>Temple,</hi> but alſo the vail of <hi>the fleſh of Chriſt;</hi> and are come to behold him, and dwell with him, who was before the cauſe of vails had a being; before the cauſe of the law, the labour of the Prophets, and ſuffering of Chriſt had a being. This ſtate is precious to behold, and very delightful to enjoy. This is the light of his countenance in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, which <hi>is better than corn, wine, oil, or all viſible things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the bleſſed end of waiting upon God, as the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid doth upon the eye of her miſtreſs. Whether thou art as a babe, as a child, as a young man, as an elder, or as a father; thy duty is, in all theſe ſtates and growths, to have thy eye unto the Lord, that he may lead thee from the one into the other, and preſerve thee therein by his grace, which is able and ſufficient to teach thee all good, ſave and defend thee from all evil, lead thee into glory, and eſtabliſh thee in the kingdom thereof forever.</p>
            <p n="68">LXVIII. It is a very bleſſed thing, and thoſe are the people that are come to a bleſſed ſtate and condition, who can ſay in truth, that <hi>their bodies are the temple of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Theſe are they whoſe eyes behold their teacher; their eye is inward
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:013006_0081_0F8FB1D6F6F3CB78"/>unto him, who teacheth in his temple, and whoſe glory ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in his temple. Theſe are the bleſſed people that have this knowledge; and all that have it, know how they come by it, and how they became ſo, having been the temples of the unclean ſpirit. They know the temple that was defiled and polluted, cleanſed and purged, and the unclean ſpirit and his works caſt forth. Theſe are a watchful people againſt all that would defile the temple again, and theſe are the true temple worſhippers in this day and age, and this is the temple in which every one ſpeaks of the <hi>glory of the Lord,</hi> of the <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord,</hi> and of <hi>his wonderous works wrought therein,</hi> even <hi>in his temple not made with hands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the antitype and ſubſtance of the outward temple built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and the various worſhips and ſervices therein; even when people are brought into ſuch a ſtate, as to know their bodies the temple of the living God; that he walks in them, and dwells in them, according to the ancient prophecies of holy men. Theſe are an habitation of God through the ſpirit.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the worſhippers in <hi>ſpirit,</hi> in <hi>truth,</hi> not only in appointed places and ſolemn aſſemblies, but at other times and places, bowing to every appearance of God in his temple, in the ſpirit and in the truth in the inward parts, which God loves, accepts and delights in.</p>
            <p>The outward temple, after it was finiſhed and ſanctified, became defiled, polluted, and made as a den of thieves, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it became robbed, and ſpoiled of all its treaſure, and ſo in the end deſtroyed. This was or came to paſs in the figure, and is written for our learning: <hi>Let all be watchful and take heed, leſt after they know their bodies the temples of God, ſanctified or made holy, they become polluted and defiled again.</hi> Such God will deſtroy with woful deſtruction.</p>
            <p>It is very precious when people are come, not only to know their bodies the temples of the Holy Ghoſt, which knowledge is abſolutely needful, for without it there is no being a <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> but alſo are come to know an heavenly ſtillneſs, an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly ſilence in the temple, no buying and ſelling, nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing; no noiſe of the workman's iron-tool in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, for that defiles the temple, and pollutes the altar, if it be but lifted up upon it. The beſt parts, inventions and arts of man in the fall, hath nothing to do in rearing an altar, in building a temple, nor in ſetting up a worſhip, or offering ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to God. His righteouſneſs and his wickedneſs are both abomination to the Lord.</p>
            <p n="69">LXIX. The goſpel is <hi>the power of God unto ſalvation.</hi> This
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:013006_0082_0F8FB1D7B48E8378"/>goſpel was preached in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, yea in <hi>Enoch</hi>'s and <hi>Alam</hi>'s time, and ſalvation was obtained in it and by it. Thoſe that obeyed this goſpel, the power of God, in thoſe ages, were ſaved by it <hi>from evil, made juſt and holy men, friends of God and walked with him.</hi> Thus it was before the law, under the law, through the Prophets.

            <head>A TREATISE CONCERNING THOUGHTS and IMAGINATIONS.</head>
            <p>EVIL thoughts and imaginations, are great troublers of the world; and it is a great miſery which man is accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied and ſurrounded with, who is given up to follow and obey his own evil thoughts and imaginations; or to walk according to them: It was a ſore judgment pronounced againſt the diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedient rebellious <hi>Jews,</hi> in the word of the Lord by <hi>Jeremy,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Hear O earth, behold I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts.</hi> And the Lord by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, <hi>I have ſtretched out my hand all day to a rebellious people, which walked in a way that was not good, after their own thoughts, which are thoughts of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</hi> Alſo it is written, <hi>Every thought and imagination of man's heart are only evil, and that continually.</hi> And very great is the miſery, bondage, and ſlavery of mankind in this eſtate; he is an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God, and to himſelf, and to his neighbour and brother, <hi>Waſting and deſtruction are in their paths, who have not God in all their thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now reader, that which is principally on my mind, is, to ſet before thee a certain infallible way, how thou mayeſt come to be ſaved from following or obeying thy own thoughts, and to gain ſtrength againſt, and get victory over all thy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations that are evil; and alſo how thou mayeſt attain to good thoughts and heavenly meditations in the room thereof; and how thou mayeſt come to know every good thought and deſire brought into the obedience of Chriſt, and every evil thought and imagination deſtroyed, and conſumed with the breath of his mouth, and the brighneſs of his appearing. And
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013006_0085_0F8FB1D9F02272E0"/>when thou art reſtored and brought into the ſame eſtate man was in before tranſgreſſion, even into the garden of God, how thou muſt then dreſs and keep the garden. Thou muſt then watch over, and in the wiſdom and power of God, govern thy thoughts, leſt the ſerpent beguile thee as he did <hi>Eve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, thou muſt underſtand that from the ground evil thoughts and imaginations ariſe from, ſpring all the briers, thorns, and thiſtles, and other hurtful weeds in the world of mankind, in whoſe heart they began to ſpring, grow and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, even ſo ſoon as he began to loſe his faith in God his maker, and incline to hearken to the voice of the ſerpent, and give credit to his lies which begot a vain thought; from whence a falſe hope ſprung, that they ſhould by eating the forbidden fruit, better their conditions, <hi>be as Gods,</hi> according as the ſerpent told the woman, the weaker veſſel, and by this falſe hope, grounded upon the thoughts and imaginations, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the firſt tranſgreſſion; then when the temptation was entered into, and ſin committed, thoughts and imaginations began to multiply and fill the diſobedient earthly heart of man, who having now turned his back upon the heavenly, ſlighted the voice and command of God, who was his <hi>teacher</hi> and <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver,</hi> and lent his ear to the wicked one, and gave up his mind and heart to obey him, even with thoughts it was all for the beſt. Thus poor man being deceived with vain thoughts, and falſe hope, loſt his habitation and dwelling-place in Paradiſe; which after he had tranſgreſſed, he ſtill thought to keep; for he was ſoon convinced he had done amiſs in eating the forbidden fruit, and fear poſſeſſed his heart, when he heard the voice of God in the cool of the day, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſought means to cover and hide himſelf from the ſight of God: But herein his thoughts were vain, and his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to no purpoſe; the woman, man, and ſerpent, all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the fruits of their own doings; nothing but life, good and bleſſings were known before; now death, evil and curſing, the fruit and effect of diſobedience, (which as I have ſaid, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered firſt by giving place to a vain thought and deſire, in hope to gain and better their eſtate) became the daily companions of mankind, who found and finds by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oful experience, that ſaying true, <hi>When ſin is finiſhed it brings forth death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So man having loſt his place in the garden which God planted, through neglecting his work which God appointed him to do, which was <hi>to dreſs it, and to keep it;</hi> for the garden needed dreſſing and keeping before the forbidden fruit was eaten, innocency, was loſt, and ſin was committed.</p>
            <p>And this ariſeth in my mind, to teſtify to all the wiſe in
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:013006_0086_0F8FB1DCD389EC30"/>heart, that after they are come to find that which was loſt, to witneſs a reſtoration and regeneration, and a returning into <hi>Eden,</hi> into innocency, they have work there to do; <hi>dreſſing</hi> and <hi>keeping</hi> are two very ſignificant words. This was the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of man in the beginning, in the ſtate of innocency; if he had not neglected this work, ſlighted the light, power, wiſdom and glory of God, with which he was repleniſhed, he had never fell; when the temptation got into a thought, if he had watched in the light and wiſdom of God, he would have ſeen and diſcovered the tendency of it, and have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented its coming to a deſire and act: But firſt giving place to a ſelfiſh thought, it ſoon ſprang to a hunger or deſire, thence in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to act, this is the beginning and progreſs of ſin at this day, which mankind in innocency had; and hath power and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from God to prevent, if he abide in it, and keep in his watch-tower, the light and ſtrength of God, which is as near him as the temptation can be, and ſufficient to preſerve him: And where this work is neglected, men, yea, holy men fall, and ſin after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s tranſgreſſion, and are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled as the ſerpent did <hi>Eve,</hi> drawn out of innocency, and a ſinleſs eſtate after they have attained unto it; therefore let none be high-minded, but fear and take the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> for example, who when he was tempted, did not deſire after the things preſented, though very ſpecious in appearance and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with very large promiſes; even as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had: But 'tis written, while the temptation laſted he eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; he let nothing in, gave no place to ſelfiſh thoughts, and enticements of the enemy: So when the temptation was over, angels miniſtred unto him: Let this be the example of all the children of light, and as they do thereafter, the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful ſalvation of God ſhall ſurround them, <hi>And neither heights nor depths, angels, principalities, nor powers, things preſent, or things to come, ſhall be able to ſeperate them from the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> This is a word by the way.</p>
            <p>Now evil thoughts and imaginations are of a multiplying na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and do mainly increaſe and take root in the generality of mankind; who through evil works are eſtranged from the life of God, remaining a degenerate plant, ſprang from the ſeed of the evil doer, and dwells and labours in that ground which God hath curſed, and knows not the ſeed of the woman to bruiſe the ſerpent's head, and to redeem and preſerve him from following and obeying his own thoughts and imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are evil, and that continually. And indeed in that ſtate can be no otherwiſe, whether they lead into ſelf-ſaming
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013006_0087_0F8FB1DD9A9FFE88"/>or ſelf-righteouſneſs, both are abomination to the Lord, and deſtructive to the well-being of mankind, both temporal and eternal: For all the wickedneſs that hath been brought forth and acted in the world ſince the beginning, began or appeared firſt in the thought; and the thought being cheriſhed and join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to by the mind, will, and underſtanding, it increaſed, and increaſeth into words and actions. That which is clean can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not proceed from that which is unclean; the heart of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in the fall is univerſally corrupted, and deſperately wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And, as hath been ſaid, the thoughts and imaginations thereof are evil, and that continually: And before it can be otherwiſe, there is an abſolute neceffity that every particular man and woman know and experience for, and in themſelves, their hearts cleanſed, purged and purified, and created new; the ground muſt be made good, before the ſeed, the heavenly plant can grow, increaſe and flouriſh therein; before good thoughts, heavenly thoughts and meditations can ariſe, ſpring and remain therein. And when this eſtate is known, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, then to abide with him, dwell and walk with him, who hath wrought theſe mighty things in thee, and for thee, and in his wiſdom and power to dreſs and keep the garden, the heart, with all diligence, that that which would defile en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter not, creep in again, as it did in the beginning, which is poſſible. Therefore what the ſpirit of God put man upon in the beginning, when he was a noble plant in <hi>Eden,</hi> wholly a right ſeed, <hi>viz.</hi> to dreſs and keep the garden; ſo the ſpirit of God now in this age ſaith, <hi>Watch and pray, leſt ye enter into temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; take heed, leſt as the ſerpent beguiled</hi> Eve, <hi>through his ſubti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, ſo your minds ſhould be corrupted from the ſimplicity that is in Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this I teſtify from certain knowledge, that God hath ordained means, whereby mankind, whoſe heart is ſo corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that nothing that is good proceeds out of it, neither any thing that is heavenly, and of God, ſprings up in it, that can live a moment, being ſo foul and ſo dark, even like a foul dark piece of earth outwardly, on which the ſun never ſhines, nor the rain falls, that man in this miſerable ſtate may come to know and experience his foul heart cleanſed, purged and ſanctified, as the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in the primitive times did; <hi>Such were ſome of you, but now are you waſhed, cleanſed, and ſanctified,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The fallow ground may be plowed up, and bear ſeed, and the wilderneſs may become a fruitful field, and ſtreams may break forth in the deſert, and the deſert may come to rejoice and to bloſſom as a roſe; crooked things may be made ſtraight, and rough places ſmooth; great heavy dark high mountains may be brought down and removed, yea melted at the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013006_0088_0F8FB1DDDAC3D268"/>preſence of God, and the low vallies may be exalted; yea the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may become like</hi> Eden, <hi>and the deſert like the garden of the Lord.</hi> All theſe mighty works and wonders hath the Lord wrought in this age, in and for a remnant, who are come to the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the prophecies, are living witneſſes of the ſame, and do in his holy ſpirit, and power, proclaim that the love and mercy of God towards loſt man, is univerſal, and that his hand is ſtretched forth to help him out of the ſnare, pit, and deep dark dungeon, wherein he is fallen; out of which he cannot by all his ſtrength, wiſdom, and invention, help him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and to ſet him at liberty, that he may run the ways of his commandments with delight, and that he may come again to ſtand upright, as God made man in the beginning; and lay aſide all his thoughts and inventions, wherein he corrupted himſelf; and to bring him into ſuch a ſtate and condition, that he may be able to do all things that are good, to think good thoughts, ſpeak good words, and do good works; and ſo eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chew and avoid the contrary: This to know and be able to do, in the <hi>one thing</hi> needful, without which all men are miſerable, let their knowledge, wiſdom, and profeſſion of religion, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and invention, be what it will.</p>
            <p>Therefore my mind is in good-will to mankind, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived knowledge and underſtanding of the means of God hath ordained for their good and ſalvation: And being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing acquainted with the two great myſteries of godlineſs and iniquity, and the way and working of each, to impart and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify ſomething of the ſame in a few words, to inſtruct and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe to whom this my teſtimony may come, how they may attain thereunto, and how they may come to be rid of thoſe troubleſome companions, <hi>viz.</hi> evil thoughts and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that ariſe in their hearts, while corrupted; and how the ſame may be purified and made a holy habitation for God, as it was before ſin entered, before innocency was loſt, before the ſerpent deceived the weaker veſſel, when all was good, yea very good.</p>
            <p>The way that leadeth thereto, I declare to be as followeth; and whoever thou art that haſt a mind or deſire to find that which is loſt, obſerve, believe, and receive what I ſay or write, as <hi>truth;</hi> not received or learned by tradition, but by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimental powerful work and operation of the ſpirit of truth in my own mind: And what I have ſaid, or ſhall ſay, is, and ſhall be according to the holy ſcriptures, and witneſſed to by them, for I cannot write contrary to them, being in unity with them, and with the juſt men's ſpirits-that wrote them. Firſt then know thou O man! whoever thou art, and whatever
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013006_0089_0F8FB1DE74187CA0"/>thy thoughts and imaginations are, how far ſoever thou art run into corruption, darkneſs and degeneration from the ſtate of innocency, purity, and holineſs; yet there is a meaſure of divine light attends thee; though thou art darkneſs, it ſhines in thee, in order to ſhew thee thy way out of it; though thou art degenerated and run from God into the earth, yet this pure light and ſpirit of God follows thee, and calls thee back; and thou mayeſt in this ſtate hear it as a voice behind thee, ſaying, <hi>Return, return, this is the way, come and walk in it;</hi> this is the kindneſs and love of God to thee in his Son, who is the light of the world, and lighteth every one that cometh there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into; if thou hear and obey this voice of the light of the Son of God, though thou wert dead in ſin, and buried as in a grave, thou ſhalt ariſe and come forth and live before him; the bars and gates of hell ſhall not be able to retain thee: But if thou ſlight and deſpiſe the light of God that viſits thee, and ſhutteſt thy ear againſt its voice, it will be as a thouſand witneſſes againſt thee, while thou rebelleſt againſt it, and art found following thy own thoughts and imaginations, and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the thing that is evil; for this light I ſpeak of, is the eye of the Lord, that runs to and fro through the earth, behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evil and the good, and that diſcerneth the thoughts and intents of the heart; it's the word that's nigh in the mouth and in the heart; which is quick and powerful, ſharper than any two-edged ſword, and of the joints and marrow: This is the candle of the Lord that ſearcheth <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and gives light to the ſides of the earth, and corners of the world, from whom the <hi>ſhadow</hi> of <hi>death</hi> cannot hide, nor the <hi>tocks and mountains</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver or defend; <hi>for he that formeth the mountains, and createth the winds, and declareth or ſheweth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkneſs, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, the Lord, the God of Hoſts is his name.</hi> This is the ſpirit of truth that convinceth the world of ſin, and that ſets men's ſins in order before them, and reproves and ſmites in ſecret for evil, and that brings to judgment the hidden things of <hi>Eſau:</hi> From this eye or light of the Lord, thou canſt not hide thyſelf no more than <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> could, though thou ſhouldeſt hate the light, which ſheweth thee thy thoughts, and love the darkneſs ſo as to dwell in it, yet the light or eye of God will purſue thee and find thee out; hell nor the utmoſt parts of the earth, and darkneſs, cannot ſecure thee from the juſt condemnation of God; becauſe thou hateſt the ſhining of his light, and ſtoppeſt thy ear againſt the voice and teaching of it, and loveſt the darkneſs, and dwelleſt in it, while thou
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:013006_0090_0F8FB1DF375B4F78"/>doeſt ſo, thou chooſeſt the way of death, and neglecteſt the means of ſalvation that God hath ordained: For this is the <hi>Condemnation of the world, that light is come into it, and men love darkneſs rather, becauſe their deeds are evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now at the firſt ſtep towards reſtoration and everlaſting hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, thou art required to turn thy mind from the darkneſs in which thou dwelleſt, to the light, eye or ſpirit of God, and to decline the power of ſatan that works in the darkneſs and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the power of God; and when thou doeſt but begin to do ſo, thou wilt find the ſcales to fall from thy eyes by degrees, and the vail to be taken off thy heart, and the fetters and chains of darkneſs to be looſed, and thy priſon doors opened, ſo when thy candle is lighted, and thy eye opened; thou wilt diſcern thy way out, and ſee the angel of the Lord go before thee, and guide thee in the ſame: And thou wilt alſo perceive what is in thy houſe, and clearly underſtand what hath lodged in the dark room of thy heart, and when thou comeſt to ſee things as they are, <note n="*" place="margin">Miſtake in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding concerning the nature of things that do preſent themſelves before mankind, is the cauſe of error. Thence it is that ſome call darkneſs light, and light darkneſs.</note> thou wilt receive wiſom to give them names according to their nature, and to judge righteouſly corcerning them: And as thou loveſt this light, thou wilt be enabled by it to divide betwixt thought and thought, and begin to make con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of a thought, and to hate every vain thought; and when thou canſt not be eaſily rid of them, nor remove them from their old lodging place, thou wilt breath and cry to the Lord in the ſpirit, as one of old did, who was burthened and oppreſſed with their company; <hi>Search me and try me, O God! and know my heart, try me and know my thoughts, and ſee if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi> This is the cry which the Lord hears, and will anſwer in due and needful time. And <hi>Jeremiah's</hi> cry to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was, <hi>Waſh thy heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved; how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?</hi> Now the only way to diſlodge them, and to be rid of their company, is to ſhew them no countenance, make no proviſion for them, give them no en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, but by the light of God which diſcovers them to be thy enemies, judge them, and keep thy mind exerciſed in the light and power of God, that it is turned to; and though they do and may ariſe, purſue and compaſs thee about like bees, yet thou keeping thy eye fixed in the light and power of God, which is as nigh thee as thy thoughts are, and ſhewe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h them unto thee, thou wilt ſee them in due time ſcattered as
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:013006_0091_0F8FB1DFF2C57F60"/>chaff before a fierce wind, and deſtroyed as ſtubble before a devouring fire.</p>
            <p>Now as thou comeſt to be a believer in the light, and to truſt in the power of God, to which thy mind is turned, thou wilt become in very deed a child of it, and ſoon be able to ſay, Darkneſs is paſt, and the true light now ſhineth, by which thon canſt ſee and judge every thought and motion that ariſeth and ſtirreth in thy mind, whether evil or innocent, hurtful or harmleſs, and have wiſdom to order them accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly. And this is that primitive wiſdom mankind had in the beginning, but he abode not in it, through looking at the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and beauty of the thing preſented to the eye of his mind. The woman was deceived in her thoughts; in her judgment and underſtanding was ſhe beguiled before ſhe obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the tempter; it appeared <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. iii. 6.</note> 
               <hi>good for food, pleaſant and deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable,</hi> and able to make one wiſe, before ſhe eat, or gave to her huſband. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. ii. 14.</note> the woman being deceived, was in the tranſgreſſion ſubjected to vanity; <note n="‡" place="bottom">Rom. viii. 20.</note> not willingly, but through hope; ſhe hoped to find the ſerpent's words true; and to become more wiſe, and more happy, by taking the ſerpent's counſel; but inſtead thereof, fell into the depth of miſery: The ſame danger attends the children of light; the ſons and daughters of God, for <hi>Adam</hi> was a ſon of God before tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſiion. And it is only ſuch who are in the reſtoration, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the light, and of the day, that are capable to fall as <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> did, and to fin after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam's</hi> tranſgreſſion, and to loſe innoceney, purity, holineſs and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs as they did, and be driven out of the garden of God, as they were. Such as were never in it, nor never dwelt in the ſtate of reſtoration, innocency, purity and holineſs, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to fall from, or loſe it; children of darkneſs, and children of the devil, who have gone aſtray, and dwelt in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the region and ſhadow of death, never knew what the life of purity and holineſs is, nor what the ſimplicity of the goſpel of Chriſt is, ſo cannot be beguiled as the ſerpent did <hi>Eve,</hi> of that they never knew, nor had, as men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men now in the world; yet ſuch are beguiled by the ſerpent in another ſort; not of what they have had, and did once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, but of what they might have and would enjoy: And this he effects by keeping the eyes and minds of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple abroad, and by perſuading them to follow any thing, and walk in any way, rather than to turn the eye of their minds inward to the <hi>Light, word, power,</hi> and <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> which

               <hi>ſhines,</hi> which <hi>ſpeakes,</hi> which <hi>works in man,</hi> in order to <hi>lead,</hi> to <hi>teach,</hi> to <hi>guide</hi> and <hi>direct</hi> him into the way of life, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to bring him into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God, into a perfect tranſlation from darkneſs to light, and from the kingdom and power of ſatan, to the kingdom and power of the Son of God, and to know Chriſt made unto him wiſdom, ſanctification and redemption.</p>
            <p>This is the bleſſed end of God in ſending his Son a light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, even to enlighten the <hi>Gentile, Jew,</hi> profeſſor and prophane; and that through him they might believe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive eternal life, and enter into that bleſſed reft that God hath prepared, which the primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> who believed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into; where they did not ſpeak their own words, nor think their own thoughts, nor do their own works, <hi>their heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly father ſpake in them, and their thoughts were thoughts of God, and be wrought all their works in them and for them.</hi> This is a bleſſed ſtate indeed; and none are entered into the reft which God hath prepared, but ſuch as are come to witneſs and experience theſe things now in this age, as the primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> did in ages paſt.</p>
            <p>For while any are found thinking their own thoughts, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their own words, and doing their own works, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a profeſſion of Chriſt and <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> they cannot enter into the reſt which God hath prepared, though they may create to themſelves falſe reſts and kindle a fire, and walk by the light of their own ſparks, but in the end lie down in ſorrow.</p>
            <p>True reſt and peace is obtained, or comes through a true ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial: A dying to ſelf-ſinning, and ſelf-righteouſneſs, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinking, and working, contriving and inventing, ſelf-wiſdom and underſtanding alſo: All theſe things muſt be denied, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilated or brought to nothing, and confounded: The feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note n="†" place="margin">The feeding on the forbidden fruit, which was good in itſelf, tho' not for food; occaſioned, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cationeth at this day, all the miſeries that attend man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</note> upon theſe things occaſioned and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioneth the curſe, and all the labour, trouble, ſorrow and torment that hath attended and doth attend mankind ſince the fall; to the death muſt they all come before a ſitting down in the kingdom of God can be witneſſed, or before any can ceaſe from their own works, as God did from his.</p>
            <p>Now thou who art a child of light, <hi>underſtand</hi> this one thing for thy comfort and encouragement in thy warfare againſt evil thoughts; that notwithſtanding multitude of thoughts do ariſe in thee, and troops thereof attend thee, which are in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſinful; yet if thou join bot with them in thy mind, will and underſtanding, they are not thy thoughts, neither ſhall

            <p>Now it is a heavenly eſtate to live under the government of Chriſt, to know and experience him, ſwaying the ſcepter in the heart, and eſtabliſhed in the throne thereof: But this none come to enjoy, till they have firſt known him, to ſit as a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner with fire, and as a fuller with ſoap; and as a ſpirit of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and burning; and as the ſtronger man to diſpoſſeſs the ſtrong man, ſpoil all his goods, ſweep and cleanſe the houſe, and to furniſh it again with heavenly goods, thoughts, deſires and meditations, and all things elſe that becomes the houſe of the Lord: Holineſs to the Lord was written or engraved upon the crown and plate of gold, and all the furniture of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward temple was ſanctiſied, of which this is the antitype, or ſubſtance, as he that enjoys it well knows.</p>
            <p>And now it is the duty of a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> to watch in the light againſt evil thoughts, and to uſe the ax of God, which is laid to the root of them, that their ſpringing again may be hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the end of them prevented, ſo alſo it is the duty of every one, when good thoughts and deſires ſpring in the room thereof, to cheriſh them, to join with them, and to keep their eye unto the Lord that begat them, or raiſed them up in the heart; being thoughts of purity, thoughts of peace and righteouſneſs, thoughts of holineſs and joy, in the inward man; which thoughts thou of thyſelf cannot think: Theſe are comfortable thoughts, <note n="‖" place="margin">Good thoughts are of God's own begetting, and very comfortable to a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and are the fruit and effect of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and obeying the law of God within the heart, <hi>Rom.</hi> ii. 14, 15.</note> juſtifying and excuſing thoughts, thoughts that will ſtand approved in the light, and the end and tendency of them

               <hi>Concerning the Life, State and Enjoyment of a</hi> TRUE CHRISTIAN.</head>
            <p>THE life of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> of an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> indeed, in whom is no guile, is a life of innocency, peace and content; qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etneſs and true ſatisfaction abounds in the inward man, ſo none can harm him; he lives in the fear of God, which taught him to depart from iniquity, and now preſerveth him out of the ſame, he loveth God and his neighbour, and hates no man, ſo fears not what man can do unto him; his bread is ſure, and his water fails not: If he hath wife or children, houſe or land, or the increaſe of corn, wine and oil, he looks upon them as things below, ſo doth not ſet his heart and affection upon them; he looks upon them as they are, and loves them in their places, but not more than Chriſt; he loves the Lord above all, he loves to keep his conſcience void of offence towards God, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards man above all; and if he cannot enjoy his eſtate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations according to the will of God, he is ready and willing to part with them, and can ſay as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>the Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away; bleſſed be the name of the Lord.</hi> He is not afraid of evil tidings; the ruffling of the winds, and the roaring of the ſea, doth not amaze nor affright him; he lives the life of faith, which gives him victory, and enables him to overcome all things, he keeps on the helmet of it, and the breaſt-plate of righteouſneſs, and the ſword of the ſpirit, ſo is always arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt all aſſaults of the world, fleſh and the devil; and he knows the name of the Lord as a ſtrong tower, as a ſhield, as a buckler, as a wall of defence, and is prepared to ſuffer and endure all things, like a good ſoldier with a ſettled countenance, and holy reſolution: And though by men he may be accounted ſmitten and forſaken of God, and not ſit to live upon the earth, yet he enjoys heavenly conſolation, pure tranquility of mind, refreſhment, comfort, and joy in the inward man; the King's daughter is all glorious within, and all things that do, or can befal a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> on this ſide the grave, are not worthy to be compared to the glory that <hi>is and ſhall be revealed in him:</hi> And if there was no reward on the other ſide the grave, he would not exchange his life and condition, for all the gory, riches and excellency the world can afford, ſeeing and account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it all vanity and vexation of ſpirit, yea, <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa. xl. 17.—Pſal. lxii. 9</note> leſs than nothing and lighter than vanity. Having found the precious pearl,
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013006_0097_0F8FB1E60C8C4BA8"/>which the ſwine regard not, he is willing to part with all for it, knowing the wunderful virtue, riches and power thereof, bids adien to all the fading treaſures and pleaſures of <hi>Egypt;</hi> chooſing rather to ſuffer affliction and perſecution for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs-ſake, than to enjoy the court-pleaſures of Princes; and he is a great gainer hereby, even in this life, on this ſide the grave, a hundred-fold: He finds by experience, that ſaying true. <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Tim. vi. 6</note>

            <head>Concerning <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Worſhip, what it ſtands in, and bow it is performed.</head>
            <p>THERE is a great conteſt in <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> among the divers ſects and bare profeſſions of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> about worſhip; and many are the modes and ceremonies that are cried up among them; every ſect conceiving their way to be right, all being full of diſpute, contention and quarelling one with and againſt another, envying and hating one another, fighting, killing and deſtroying one another about them, when they are all but of their own deviſing, forms and images of their own making, moſtly from the example of <hi>Jews, Gentiles</hi> and apoſtate <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and are not led thereto, nor guided therein by the uner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſpirit of God, as their fruits makes fully manifeſt, to the great ſcandal of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>Now the true <hi>Chriſtians</hi> worſhip is in the ſpirit, and in the truth, not in the letter, nor in the form barely, but was before all letters and outward laws and preſcriptions, inventions, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and the ſpirit of them was: This was the worſhip in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe; when mankind neglected this worſhip he fell into evil, into invention, into error, which was the cauſe of the outward law, and all other diſpenſations of God, for the recovery of loſt man: And before he can witneſs a return out of his loſt eſtate, he muſt come again to the ſame worſhip in the ſpirit and in the truth, even the truth in the inward parts, for that is it which God loves; to the word in the mouth, to the law in the heart, and the fear in the inward parts, from all fear to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, taught by the procepts of men, from all traditions of men of corrupt minds, from all devices and inventions of men: This is the bleſſed eſtare the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is come into, and is the end, ſum, and ſubſtance of all holy writings, forms and holy traditions, miniſtrations, and diſpenſations before the law, under the law, and the Prophets: Wilderneſs, <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and temple-worſhip which ſtood in divers bodily exerciſes, out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward works and ſervices, variety of offerings, obſerving of times, days, months, and years, meats, drinks, outward waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and purifications, new-moons, faſts, feaſts, ſolemn meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and general aſſemblies once a year at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> all theſe
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:013006_0100_0F8FB1EA93098130"/>things were but ſhadows and typical: And this is the antitype and ſubſtance ſhadowed forth by them all. To come to the worſhip in the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> in the <hi>truth,</hi> to <hi>Mount Sion,</hi> the city of the living God, the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and to <hi>come to the general aſſembly and church of the firſt-born, written in Heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and the ſpirits of juſt men made perfect.</hi> To know the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly city that comes down from God out of Heaven, even <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> the mother of all the living citizens thereof, whoſe law and covenant is ſpiritual, and writ in their hearts; whoſe love, fear and obedience to God, is engraven in their inward parts: And from hence ariſeth the true worſhip in the ſpirit, and in the truth.</p>
            <p>This is the worſhip the primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> came to, and were exerciſed in; they prayed in the ſpirit, not at any ſet time, or appointed place only, according to the exhortations, <hi>pray always, pray continually, pray without ceaſing; I will that men pray every where, liſting up holy hands without wrath or doubting:</hi> Breathing to the Lord in ſpirit, though never a word be uttered; in the cloſet when the door is ſhut, the Lord heareth and anſwereth this prayer. And many times they were, and are alſo led forth to pray in words publicly, but moſtly for the ſake of others, and in the behalf of others, as Chriſt Jeſus did.</p>
            <p>The true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is alſo a preacher of righteouſneſs, not only in words, at <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>et times, and appointed places, but in life and converſation; in this he is a preacher, a teacher of that which is good, as a candle burneth and ſet in the right place; his lamp trimmed, and his light ſhineth, as a city upon a hill, as the ſalt of the eartin, and light of the world, to ſeaſon and give light to others, by holy example, which preacheth louder than words.</p>
            <p>The true <hi>Chriſtian</hi>'s ſinging or rejoicing is alſo in the ſpirit and in the truth, and not in iniquity, and with a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; he needs no art nor invention to bring words into metre or rhime, that they may make a pleaſant ſound, and a joyful noiſe; his muſic doth not ſtand in outward ſounds, made by art and air, but his melody is in his heart, in the ſpirit, in the inward man, in the hidden man of the heart, which is the antitype and ſubſtance of all outward muſic uſed in the time of the law, under the firſt covenant, in the worſhip and ſervice of God; and as far exceeds it, as the ſubſtance of a thing doth the ſhadow thereof: And he that hath this heavenly inward re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing, and pleaſant melody in the heart, will never invent to himſelf inſtruments of muſic like <hi>David,</hi> nor delight in the ſounds thereof. Where this heart-melody is loſt, the outward invented muſic is ſet up, among <hi>Jews, Gentiles</hi> and apoſtate
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:013006_0101_0F8FB1EB3A95F878"/>
               <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> for the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> is come to know Chriſt Jeſus as a Prince of peace, as a peaceable Saviour, as the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and joy of generations; as a giver of peace, which the world cannot give nor take away, which far ſurpaſſeth all the delights of the ſons of men, which by nature, art and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, they can attain unto.</p>
            <p>Now the ſpirit of God is univerſal, and the truth is univerſal, and the true <hi>Chriſtian</hi> worſhip that ſtands in it, is alſo to be univerſal; not only when people meet together in a ſolemn manner to wait upon God, but every hour and every day, bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in ſpirit, worſhipping in the truth, which make free from all error, from all evil, from all vain obſervations, literal tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and human inventions about the worſhip of God, from all carnal ordinances, as <hi>muſics, meats, drinkings, waſhings, feaſts, faſts, days and times,</hi> which periſh with the uſing, though ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant in their firſt inſtitution; theſe things are not to be touched, nor taſted, no nor ſo much as handled by the true <hi>Chriſtian;</hi> theſe things are but beggarly elements, and worldly rudiments, which had a beginning, and muſt have an end.</p>
            <p>And the root or cauſe of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> which is Chriſt, is the end of the law, and all the types and ſhadows of it, and fulfils all the righteouſneſs of it, of the Prophets, and of <hi>John</hi> alſo, and is a bringer in of a better hope, a better law, a better covenant, a better worſhip; which hope, law, covenant and worſhip, is inward and ſpiritual, and not outward and carnal, formal nor traditional: And all that are come to this worſhip in the ſpirit, and in the truth, which is one pure eternal principle of light, life and power, and have their hearts tendered by it, and their minds exerciſed in it, their thoughts and meditations guided by it, they are come to the myſtery of the fellowſhip of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to the bleſſed unity wherein is no ſtrife, no wrangling, diſputing, or contention; no treachery, wars, cruelty or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; becauſe they are all minding one thing, learning of one teacher, following of one guide, <hi>viz.</hi> the grace and ſpirit of God: And though they have diverſity of gifts, and are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained to different degrees of faith, of grace, of knowledge, growth and ſalvation in the ſame; and are ſome as a foot, ſome as a hand, eye, ear and mouth, yet are all as members of one body; and the meaneſt hath unity with the more noble, the greateſt with the leaſt, the loweſt with the higheſt, the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt with the weakeſt. Nor is there any jar or ſchiſm in this well framed body, of which Chriſt the unction, the anointing, is the head and teacher.</p>
            <p>This heavenly unity is the antitype of the ſeamleſs coat of
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:013006_0102_0F8FB1EBF7AD5B60"/>Chriſt, wove from top to bottom, which the ſoldiers did not rent, tear, or divide, but caſt lots for, and of that law that forbad <hi>weaving linen</hi> and <hi>woolling</hi> together, and <hi>ſowing mingled ſeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there is no concord betwixt light and darkneſs, ſin and righteouſneſs, Chriſt and belial; theſe things of a <hi>different</hi> and <hi>contrary nature,</hi> cannot unite, cannot agree, though they are nigh to each other, ſown in one field. God hath ſown a good ſeed in the field of mankind; the enemy hath ſown an evil ſeed, and in many it hath taken root, and ſprang up above the good ſeed, even among thoſe profeſſing <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> itſelf; and from hence ariſeth and groweth all the evil will, envy, hatred, ſtrife, cruelty, violence, blood-ſhed, wars and murders, in the world, and till the head of this evil ſeed be not only bruiſed, by the promiſed ſeed which God hath ſowed, but rooted out al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo of the heart of man, all theſe things will grow up; theſe evil effects can never ceaſe till the cauſe be removed, and taken away, as the true <hi>Chriſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tan</hi> knoweth right well by experience.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> indeed, as they live and abide in this pure <hi>internal principle</hi> of light, life, ſpirit, and truth, they have unity one with another, and fellowſhip with God; they are the bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren whoſe living together in unity is comely to behold, who have the one mind, one heart; and have their minds and hearts always governed, ruled and ordered by the good ſpirit of God: As every one lives and keeps this order, and under this heavenly government, they cannot chooſe but live together in unity, in love, in good-will, in peace, heavenly concord and agreement, every one within himſelf, with God, and with each other, and in love to all mankind; here is the end of ſtrife, wars and fightings come unto, both within and without; and this is the time and ſtate wherein <hi>inſtruments of war and cruelty</hi> are turned into <hi>inſtruments of neceſſary uſe:</hi> And as they abide herein, they can learn war no more, according to the bleſſed fight and propheſy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> that evangelical Prophet. Here <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is known a <hi>quiet habitation,</hi> the inhabitants thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing eſtabliſhed in <hi>pence and righteouſneſs,</hi> far from oppreſſing, the cauſe of war and oppreſſion being taken away, which is <hi>evil-thinking, evil-ſpeaking</hi> and <hi>evil-doing;</hi> and this every one muſt know and experience before they can be eſtabliſhed in peace, before they can know the peace of God which paſſeth all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, to keep their hearts and minds, and to rule in their hearts, and to know the aboundings of it, and to delight therein; as it is written, <hi>The meek ſhall inherit the earth, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light themſelves in the abundance of peace;</hi> the earth, nor earthly things ſhall not inherit them; they tread upon the high places of it, and reign like Kings and Princes over all the glory thereof.
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:013006_0103_0F8FB1ECC27A71F8"/>Oh! this is a bleſſed ſtate indeed; wait all to poſſeſs and enjoy it more and more: This is the bleſſed end of the goſpel of peace, and of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion.

            <p>Now it is the ſoul of man that wants reſt, that is gone from its center, that hath loſt its ſtay, habitation, and dwelling-place in God; and innumerable are the thoughts, imaginations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and inventions, willings and runnings that poor mankind in this eſtate is exerciſed in, and carried away with, both <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> profeſſor and prophane, upon the face of the whole earth: For in all ſects and ſorts of Religions, thoſe who are ſincere and devout therein, propoſe this end to themſelves in the exerciſe thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> to attain a ſtate of happineſs and felicity at laſt; Many are the ways, means, and precepts, preſcriptions, directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and obſervations, that men give and receive from one the other, enjoin and perſuade one the other, and ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel one another by violence, to walk in, and make uſe of, in order to arrive thereto, as they think and imagine; but it is in this age, as of old, the guides and teachers of the people cauſe them to err, cauſe them to go aſtray, and wander from the right way of the Lord; they err in viſion, judgment and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now the way to everlaſting happineſs is but one, both to <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile;</hi> which way is Chriſt, who is the wiſdom and power of God, the truth and the life; and the appearance of this Chriſt, of God, is within men, in their hearts: Its firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is as a light ſhining in darkneſs, and as a pure ſpot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſpirit, that conſenteth to no evil but reproveth and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinceth all that are found in it; and to this light or ſpirit, all who write or ſpeak for God, and the good of mankind, do turn and direct the minds of men, and endeavour to perſuade them to regard its reproofs of inſtruction, as being the way to life, and to obey its counſel and teaching, as the only means of ſalvation, and way of returning to the rock from whence they were hewn, and to the hole of the pit from whence they were digged, to their habitation and dwelling place in God again, and many thouſands in this iſland and other places, can give teſtimony that this is the only way and means God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained for the recovery, return, and reſtoration of loſt man; and that all other ways and means which they had been weary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves in, availed nothing; but walking in this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly way, the light, the ſpirit and grace of God within, and learning of the anointing within, they witneſs ſalvation come to their houſe, and to ſurround them as walls and bulwarks, and to witneſs the fulfilling of that divine prophey, <note n="¶" place="bottom">Iſa. xxxii. 18. and Verſ, 3, 4</note>

The eyes of them that ſee ſhall not be dim, and the ears of them that hear ſhall hearken, the heart alſo of the raſh ſhall underſtand knowledge, and the tongue of the ſtammerers ſhall be ready to ſpeak plainly.</hi> Theſe are the bleſſed effects of walking in the way and paths of righteouſneſs, which a remnant are living witneſſes of, and can praiſe and magnify the name of the Lord in the ſenſe thereof.</p>
            <p>But none enjoy this bleſſed eſtate, nor inhabit this heavenly dwelling-place, but as their minds come truly to be exerciſed by and in the light of the Lord; and that by walking and abiding therein, come to have their minds eſtabliſhed, ſettled and ſtayed upon him who is indeed the alone ſtay of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. and rock of his inheritance.</p>
            <p>And nothing can be found in the heavens above, nor in the earth beneath, that is able to ſatisfy or ſtay the mind of man,

               <hi>Vanity of vanities, all is vanity and vexation of ſpirit.</hi> But to have the mind ſtayed upon the Lord, there is pleaſure, peace and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, truly found and enjoyed, according to the teſtimony of that divine Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> who ſaid, ſpeaking in the name of the Lord, <hi>Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed upon thee.</hi> This is a truth, that none knoweth but he that hath it; it may be ſoon writ, read or ſpoken, but to enjoy that eſtate is more than words; it is the end, ſum and ſubſtance of all that can be ſaid or done, and is the reward of the righteous from the immediate hand of God, <hi>viz. To be kept in perfect peace:</hi> It's the end of all holy breathings and deſires, it's the end of the preaching the goſpel of peace and ſalvation, even to know and feel, and experience the peace of God to keep the heart and mind, and to rule there.</p>
            <p>This is a bleſſed ſtate indeed, worthy to be waited for, and preſſed after, by all that have a ſight and ſenſe thereof, and are in a way that leadeth thereto, though not yet arrived there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at; go forward in the name of the Lord, even in that name <hi>Light,</hi> by which he hath made himſelf known unto us in this age, by which light thou ſaweſt the wandering the unſtableneſs of thy mind, and the multitude of thy thoughts, imaginations and inventions; perſevere in the ſame, and thou wilt become not only a child of it, but alſo grow from a child's eſtate to the eſtate of a young man, elder, and father; <hi>keeping the faith,</hi> and <hi>firmly believing,</hi> that which ſheweth thee the <hi>wandering</hi> and <hi>unſtableneſs</hi> of thy mind, will be as a ſhepherd's crook unto thee, and in due time will bring thee back into the fold of reſt; and that holy light that diſcovers, and ſheweth unto thee thy thoughts, and inward enemies, will alſo by the brightneſs of in ariſing, diſperſe and deſtroy them for thee, and bring thee into that eſtate thy ſoul deſireth, panteth and looketh after, even into the <hi>preſence</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> where the fulneſs of joy is, and where the rivers of pleaſures run; where the reaping and returning with joy is, where the ſinging for joy of heart is, and the joy of God's ſalvation felt, the bleſſed light of God, or Son of righteouſneſs, in whom thou haſt believed, is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly way to <hi>poſſeſs</hi> and <hi>inherit</hi> thoſe things. And thy <hi>walking, abiding,</hi> and <hi>perſevering</hi> in it, is the <hi>means,</hi> and there is not any other <hi>way</hi>

            <p>But all that walk not, nor abide and perſevere therein, after they are come into it, never attain to that bleſſed end of its appearing and ſhining to them; for a bare knowledge of the truth, and a profeſſion of the light and ſpirit of God within, if they walk not in it, and are not guided and led by it, it avails nothing, but rather draws down fierce wrath and vengeance upon the head of ſuch, who know their maſter's will and do it not, who talk and profeſs well, but are found <hi>doing evil,</hi> and thereby lay a <hi>ſtumbling-block</hi> in the way of the blind, and cauſe the way of truth to be <hi>evil ſpoken</hi> of, and the name of the Lord, by which be hath made himſelf known in this age, to be <hi>blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed,</hi> by reaſon of their <hi>ungedly deeds,</hi> under a profeſſion of godlineſs, and cloak of righteouſneſs; ſuch their <hi>damnation</hi> ſlum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bereth not.</p>
            <p>And this I teſtify and declare to all people to whom this may come, which may ſerve alſo as a <hi>caution</hi> and <hi>warning</hi> to them, that if they meet with any under the <hi>name, form</hi> and <hi>profeſſion</hi> of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> in contempt called a <hi>Quaker,</hi> who in his <hi>converſe, trade</hi> and <hi>dealing, commerſe</hi> and <hi>aſſairs;</hi> doth not let his <hi>yea</hi> be <hi>yea,</hi> and his <hi>nay, nay,</hi> but <hi>breaketh</hi> his <hi>word</hi> and <hi>promiſes,</hi> there is need to have a ſpecial care of that man, and look upon him as one <hi>falſs</hi> and <hi>deceiful</hi> to the <hi>holy principles</hi> of <hi>truth,</hi> and as a <hi>hypocrite</hi> under the <hi>profeſſion</hi> of it.
