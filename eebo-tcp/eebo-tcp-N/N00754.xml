            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Perſon and his Sufferings, and therefore I laboured the more with them to prove by Scripture, <hi>That the outward Perſon was Gods proper Son,</hi> bringing theſe for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, 1<hi>ſt.</hi> Becauſe he came down from Heaven, and, 2<hi>d.</hi> Becauſe he humbled himſelf unto his Father, by way of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection as a Son. And this I did, as a Brother, to inform them, that they might not fall into that Error themſelves which they looked upon in the Quakers to be a <hi>dangerous Hereſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now long before this, and before I joyn'd my ſelf with them in Communion <hi>J.

               <p>This, I and my Friend <hi>T. Rutter</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a ſight of, we accounted it Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous, and reproachful to Chriſt Jeſus.

at laſt he complyes with us, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth his fault: This we hoped was real in him. Upon which ſuppoſition that he ſaw his Error, and had really recanted it, by his importunity I joyned my ſelf in Church fellowſhip with him, and the reſt belonging to that Meeting. But to return, I ſtill continuing to preach and aſſert among them, <hi>That he that dyed and ſuffered upon the Croſs for the ſins of the World, was no impotent, weak nor finite Creature, but one that was a mighty God</hi> (as the Prophet ſtiled him when he was a Child, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9.7.) and yet not God the Father.</p>
               <p>And now, to requite me for all my love and labour amongſt them, <hi>J.

Next, as to the word <hi>Perſon,</hi> becauſe that is ſcrupled by ſome: <hi>what</hi> (ſay they) <hi>muſt we underſtand by Perſon? Anſw.</hi> Indeed at this rate men will ſcruple ſound and wholſom words and terms of holy Scripture. For ſo he Apoſtle ſets forth our Saviour, under the Title of Perſon; telling that he did forgive in the Perſon of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. He is called <hi>this juſt Perſon</hi> by <hi>Pilate, Mat.</hi> 27.24. But if any ſhould deſire to know what the ſignification of Perſon is, I ſhall give them the Definition thereof from <hi>Goldman</hi>; A Perſon (ſaith he) is an Individed ſubſtance of a Rational Nature. From hence we may conclude, every Subſtance that is Rational is a Perſon; and they are of three kinds, <hi>Divine, Angelical</hi> and <hi>Humane</hi>; and every Subſtance that is Irrational, is not a Perſon; ſuch are <hi>Annimals, Vegetables, Minerals</hi> and <hi>Inſenſible Creatures.</hi> Hence it is that Chriſt i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

before his Incarnation, yet that doth not argue, that he was ſuch an outward Perſon as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to be, or had ſuch a form and likeneſs properly, becauſe Angels have frequently appeared in ſuch forms, and yet none do believe that they have ſuch forms properly of their own, but that they borrow or aſſume Bodies in which they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear after this manner.</hi>

But ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is no Scripture to prove this thing, or any thing like it, I ſhall preſume to prove the contrary by Scripture, to wit, <hi>That An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels do appear in their own proper Bodies, and not in borrowed or aſſumed ones.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 10.6. concerning the Angel that appeared to <hi>Daniel, That his Body alſo was like the Beryl, and his Face as the appearance of Lightning,</hi> &amp;c. Where note, it is ſaid [<hi>His Body</hi>] meaning the Angel; 'tis not ſaid a borrowed or aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Body. So then I conclude from hence, it was the Angels own proper Body; from whence alſo it appears that Angels do appear
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000908_0059_0FACA090E7235538"/>
in their own proper forms, and conſequently our Saviour himſelf, when he did ſo appear, who was and is the head of the Angels,</p>

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> of this fooliſh Opinion, are many, whereof I will give ſome few. 1ſt. Then if they do borrow Bodies, it muſt be ſome ones Body, that belongs either to the quick or dead. If to the quick, the Perſon whoſe Body the Angel doth occupy, would be ſenſible of the ſaid occupation, and then it would not only be a borrowing or aſſuming the Body, but the Soul alſo, and conſequently the Perſon would give a relation of it, to ſome of his Friends or others, by which means we might have more certain knowledge of ſuch a thing. But of ſuch a thing we never heard. 2. If to the Dead, it muſt be a Body that hath been newly Dead, or one that hath laid ſome time in the Grave. As to the firſt, <hi>one newly Dead,</hi> this would be a Miracle ſeen and beheld of men, becauſe the dead Bodies of men are never caſt out of the ſight of the living, until they are entoombed in the Grave, and then we ſhould have more knowledge of it. But this is ridiculous, as well as abſurd, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to reaſon. As to the ſecond, If one that hath been ſome time in the grave, Then
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000908_0060_0FACA09161DAABF8"/>
this would be a Reſurrection to that Body without its own proper Soul, which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd, and againſt the Ana<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> for that purpoſe, &amp; then every time an Angel appears to men he muſt have a new creation, in order to his appearance. But enough of this. I hope the Reader by this time may ſee the folly of ſuch an idle Opinion.</p>
