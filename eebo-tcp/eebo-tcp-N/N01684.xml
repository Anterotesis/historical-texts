            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>HRIST JESUS having been Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized and after that tempted of Satan for Forty days, doth in a more eminent manner enter into the execution of his Prophetical Office, and Preacheth his Sermon in the Mount contained in this and the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Chapters. He begins his Sermon by teaching them, who are bleſſed Men; and their in this and the next verſe he teaches his Diſciples what is their Office, and the work which they are to do as his Miniſters. Firſt
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001998_0003_0FBA4F63E7DACA10"/>he tells them, they are the <hi>Salt of the Earth:</hi> Firſt it may be enquired, who he ſpeaks to? Some think that it is ſpoke of profeſſed Chriſtians; but that doth not ſeem proper. Forthen when Countries come to be Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized, there would be no difference between the <hi>Salt</hi> and them that are <hi>Salted.</hi> Chriſt knew that whole Nations would entertain the Chriſtian Religion; and who then would they be <hi>Salt</hi> unto? But I judge that he intends the Apoſtles, and it may be the ſeventy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, if they were at that time preſent; tho' they were not yet called to their Office, yet Chriſt deſigned them to it. We find a diſtinction, <hi>ver.</hi> 1. between his Auditors and his Diſciples, <hi>Seeing the Multitudes, he went up into a mountain, and when he was ſet his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples came unto him.</hi> Again we may enquire, Why doth Chriſt compare them to Salt? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Salt has many uſeful qualities, it has Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal vertues in it, applied outwardly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; but it hath two properties eſpecially, one is, that it ſavours Meats, gives a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful reliſh to them, makes them more accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the ſtomach, takes away their crude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and is an help to digeſtion. Job. 6.6. <hi>Can that which is unſavoury be taken without ſalt.</hi> The other is, that it preſerves things from corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and putrefaction. Fleſh and ſome other Meats are liable in a little time to corrupt
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001998_0004_0FBA4F64D0991988"/>and ſpoil: but Salt has vertue to preſerve them; and in this reſpect the Apoſtles are compared to Salt. He doth not ſpeak of what they were <hi>de facto,</hi> but of what they were <hi>de jure,</hi> what they were by their Office to be. Again it may be enquired, Who would have the benefit? <hi>Anſ.</hi> The Earth, or the Land where they dwell; by Earth you are to underſtand the Inhabitants of the Earth. This is amplifyed by their incurableneſs if they looſe their ſavour. Not but that a Miniſter may be recovered, if he looſe his ſavour; but if the Miniſtry ſhould looſe their ſavour, there is none to recover them, 2. by their unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitableneſs if they grow corrupt &amp; unſavoury. They are unſerviceable and deſerve to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. <hi>It is good for nothing but to be caſt out and trodden under foot of men.</hi>

               <head>DOCTRINE.</head>
               <q>THE Miniſters of the Goſpel are by their Office to preſerve the People from Corruption.</q>
               <p>IT is a great miſery to a People to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, to be like putrifyed and rotten Meat, they will be an affliction and enemies one to another, and expoſed unto the Judgments of God. But the Miniſters of the Goſpel are means to preſerve them from corruption.
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001998_0005_0FBA4F66543704B0"/>Magiſtrates in their place have their influence on them to preſerve them from corruption: but eſpecially Miniſters are uſeful that way. In ſuch Nations where there is no Goſpel Miniſtry, People are very corrupt: if by the light of Nature and ſeverity of Rulers, they be preſerved from groſſer iniquities, yet they are always very corrupt. But the Faithful Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Goſpel-Miniſters is a ſpecial help to preſerve from corruptions. A Goſpel-Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry is looked upon by ſome Perſons as an heavy charge, they groan under the burden of it; but Men have little reaſon to think much of the charge conſidering the benefit that they are to a People, as they are means to prevent the growing of corruption. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters had need be careful that they do <hi>fulfill their Miniſtry,</hi> for their work is not only of great concernment to themſelves, but alſo to Multitudes of others, by keeping the Country from corruption.</p>
               <p>Conſider 1. THAT <hi>People are very prone to grow corrupt.</hi> As the Bodies of Men if they be not duly looked after, will grow corrupt, ſo will the Souls of Men. A profeſſing People are in great danger, many of them are in their natural condition, and godly Men that are among them, are but in part ſanctifyed; and there are a great many young ones growing up among them, that are born in ſin, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001998_0006_0FBA4F7FF3903200"/>of temptations; and there is a great deal of danger that in a little time they will be corrupted. As Buildings are ſubject to decay, and Fields to be tainted, ſo People are to be corrupted. Iſai. 1.21. <hi>How is the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful city become an harlot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. IN reſpect of the <hi>Principles of Religion.</hi> The Church of God is called the <hi>pillar and ground of truth,</hi> 1 Tim. 3.15. And if they don't <hi>hold faſt the form of wholſom words,</hi> they will quickly run to ruin. The practice of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion doth depend upon the principles; if they looſe the knowlege of the truth, they can't make due improvement of it. Blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is a corruption and it leads to corrupt practices. And that they are in danger of,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) By <hi>Ignorance.</hi> A knowing People may in time become an ignorant People. The People of <hi>Grece</hi> were ſome of the learnedeſt People of the World, in former Generations. <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Athens</hi> were called the two eyes of the World, but ſince that they are become very ignorant. Darkneſs many times ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds where there was a great deal of light. If the preſent Generation be knowing Men, in a few years many of them may die, and the young Generation, if they have not ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table means of inſtruction will be very igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; though they grow to years of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001998_0007_0FBA4F822A8A7120"/>may be ignorant of the principles of Religion. Parents may bequeath their Eſtates to them, but they can't bequeath their Knowlege to them. If their Teachers be blind and ignorant, as the complaint is, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 56.10. no wonder if the People be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant. The People of Iſrael grew in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of time a very ignorant People. Hoſ. 4.1. <hi>There is no knowlege of God in the land.</hi> If a People be a knowing People, yet by the change of a Generation, they may be children in underſtanding.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) BY <hi>Errors.</hi> Men have a great deal of carnal reaſon, and ſo are in danger to grow erroneous. There be a great many temptations from without to errors, there be many falſe Doctrines publiſhed in the World. Men have mightily corrupted the Doctrine of the Chriſtian Religion: there have been heretical teachers that have broached dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous errors. 2 Pet. 4.1. <hi>There ſhall be falſe teachers among you, who ſhall privily bring in damnable hereſies.</hi> And Satan is buſy to blind the minds of Men. 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>The God of this world has blinded their minds.</hi> And there be many temptations in Mens own hearts to ſeduce them: carnal men don't love Evangelical truths; and the pride of their hearts expoſes them; they are unwilling to acknowlege ſuch truths as they cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001998_0008_0FBA4F83B117AC38"/>The luſts of Mens hearts do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline them to receive heretical Doctrines. 2 Tim. 3.6. <hi>They lead captive ſilly women la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with ſins, led away with divers luſts.</hi> Many errors have mightily prevailed in the World. <hi>The ſmoak that has come out of the bottomleſs pit has darkned the air,</hi> Rev. 9.2. <hi>Arianiſm</hi> did ſo for a while, and <hi>Pelagianiſm,</hi> and <hi>Popery,</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſm:</hi> many Countries are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IN reſpect of <hi>Practice.</hi> Fallen Men are great enemies to the power of Godlineſs, and in great danger to carry themſelves corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: it is difficult to make a profeſſing People grow better, but they eaſily grow worſe. It is natural to thoſe that have chronical diſeaſes to grow worſe and worſe. People that are in a declining way, are in great danger to decline more and more. Jer. 16.12. <hi>Ye have done worſe than your fathers.</hi> Land that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to be tainted is liable to be tainted more and more.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) BY <hi>Formality.</hi> Where the Worſhip of God is ſet up, Men don't readily looſe the <hi>form,</hi> but it is a frequent thing to looſe the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs.</hi> It is an eaſy thing to carry on Praying, to attend Publick Worſhip, and to attend duties of Religion on the Sabbath: this may be done, though their hearts are violently ſet upon the World, and they be
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:001998_0009_0FBA4F850DBC7AC0"/>under great prevailings of evil affections: but it is very croſs to nature to mortify corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to exerciſe themſelves in ſelf-denial; give their hearts to God, and to be rejoycing in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt. Many times People that retain the <hi>name</hi> of living looſe the <hi>life</hi> of Religion, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1. People are wont to grow <hi>lukewarm,</hi> Rev. 3.15. The ſpirit of Religion doth decay by degrees.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) BY <hi>Vice.</hi> Evil practices frequently gain ground among them: the luſts of Mens hearts hurry them into bold tranſgreſſions. There be bad examples and ſmall means of reſtraint, and ſo evil practices get head. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times People grow knaviſh and injurious one to another; they have their ways of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit and oppreſſion that mightily prevail Jer. 6.6. <hi>She is wholly oppreſſion in the midſt of her.</hi> Sometimes they fall into ways of Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and lie at the Tavern, and are pouring in ſtrong Drink, they can't work without it, nor play without it, nor make bargains with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 3.1. They love Bottles of Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall into ways of wantonneſs and rudeneſs. Sin abounds in all profeſſing Countries.</p>
               <p>Conſider, 2. <hi>HOW Miniſters are to preſerve a People from Corruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. THEY are to do it by their <hi>Preaching.</hi> Miniſters are God's <hi>Meſſengers</hi> or <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:001998_0010_0FBA4F879800DA08"/>ſent to publiſh the Goſpel. Mar. 16.15. <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every creature,</hi> i. e. every humane creature. This is the principal part of their work. 1 Cor. 1.17. <hi>Chriſt ſent me not to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize but to preach the Goſpel</hi> Therefore they are called Preachers. 1 Tim. 2.7. <hi>I am or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained a Preacher.</hi> Other ſervices are to be done occaſionally, but this is the conſtant ſervice that they muſt addict themſelves unto. 2 Tim. 4.2. <hi>Preach the word, be inſtant in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, out of ſeaſon.</hi> And it is upon that account eſpecially, that <hi>double honour</hi> is due unto them. 1 Tim. 5.17. <hi>Let the Elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honour, eſpecially they that labour in the word and doctrine.</hi> The Word of God duly Preached is the ſpecial means to advance the work of ſanctification. Joh. 17.17. <hi>Sanctify them by thy truth, thy word is that truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>BY inſtructing them in the Principles of Religion, and the Rules of God's Word.</hi> The light of nature teaches Men ſome things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God and His Attributes, and it teaches them the difference concerning many things that are morally good and evil; but this light ſhines but dimly, and the characters that are written in the heart are much blurred and obliterated, and they have need to have thoſe things clearly inculcated. But the way of Salvation by Chriſt is a thing of pure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation. Natural reaſon is utterly ſilent about
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001998_0011_0FBA4F8A72545E70"/>it. The Goſpel is called the <hi>Wiſdom of God in a myſtery,</hi> and <hi>bidden wiſdom,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.7. And the work of the Miniſter is to feed Men with the <hi>ſincere milk of the word.</hi> Joh. 21.15, 16. to <hi>Feed the Sheep,</hi> and <hi>Feed the Lambs.</hi> And it is not enough that Men are able to ſay their Catechize by rote, but the Miniſter muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour in it, that they may have a confirmed knowledge of the truth: that they may have a clear, diſtinct and explicit underſtanding of the Doctrines of Religion: they muſt take pains to make them underſtand. Heb. 5.12. <hi>Ye need that one teach you again the firſt principles of the oracles of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) BY <hi>ſolemn Warnings.</hi> That was Pauls practice. Act. 20.31. <hi>I ceaſed not to warn every one of you night and day with tears.</hi> That is the duty of the Watchman, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.8. There is great danger many times of publick calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe of the abounding of Sin among them; and he muſt warn them and reprove them. Iſai. 58.1. <hi>Cry aloud, ſpare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, ſhew my people their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and the houſe of Iſrael their ſins.</hi> Godly Men are in danger to provoke God and bring ſorrow upon themſelves; and the Miniſter muſt warn them. Many lie in a natural condition, and in danger of damnation; they had need be warned. <hi>Mar.</hi> 16.16. Some are of an unruly and ungoverned converſation,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001998_0012_0FBA4F9592D3A038"/>if they continue ſo, their end will be deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; theſe muſt be warned. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14. Many Men that are in a dangerous way, are ſevere and bold, and the Miniſter muſt ſet the terrors of God before them; putting them in mind of the jealouſy of God, and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribleneſs of his indignation. There be many Scriptures wherein God ſpeaks terribly to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Men, and Miniſters ſhould make theſe Scriptures ring in their ears, and be with ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſolemnity telling them of their danger. Phil. 3.18, 19. <hi>Many walk of whom I have told you often, and now tell you weeping, that they are enemies of the croſs of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">(3.) BY <hi>ſuitable Encouragement.</hi> Awakened Sinners are in danger, though ſeldom of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing, yet of being diſcouraged; and that will be a great wrong to them, and Miniſters muſt be careful to encourage them. God puts ſuch words into their mouths. Iſai. 55.6, 7, 8. Mat. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden.</hi> Some are in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to be diſcouraged from doing their duty, from fear of want, from fear of the anger of Man, for fear of reproach; but there are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promiſes in the Word of God to ſtrengthen Mens hearts in ſuch caſes. Gal. 6.9. <hi>Let us not be weary in well-doing, for in due ſeaſon we ſhall reap if we faint not.</hi> Some are ready to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001998_0013_0FBA4F96DC7FB338"/>ſink in their Spirits, becauſe of their afflictions, their ſins, their temptations, and their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers: it is very fit ſuch ſhould be encouraged. 1 Theſ. 5.14. <hi>Comfort the feeble-minded, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the weak.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. MINISTERS ſhould preſerve a People from Corruption by <hi>good Government.</hi> God has given power of ruling to Miniſters. Heb. 13.13. <hi>Obey them that rule you and ſubmit to them.</hi> He has given a power of <hi>binding</hi> and <hi>loſing.</hi> Mat. 16.19. <hi>What thou ſhalt bind on earth ſhall be bound in heaven.</hi> And he appoints that they <hi>rule well,</hi> 1 Tim 5.17. Miniſters have a corrcive power to execute cenſures on them that are obſtinate. Miniſters muſt have a tender and compaſſionate ſpirit, but when Men are ſturdy and rebellious, ſeverity is compaſſion; executing Eccleſiaſtical cenſures is a <hi>terror to evil doers:</hi> this is a proper means that their <hi>ſpirits may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus,</hi> 1 Cor. 5.5. Though private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge is utterly forbidden, yet they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge diſobdience: 2 Cor. 10.6. <hi>Having in a readineſs to revenge all diſobedience.</hi> This is the way to purge out the old leaven, to bring Men to repentance, and to put a ſtop to prowing iniquities, that the Land be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed.</p>
               <p n="3">3. BY <hi>being good Examples.</hi> Miniſters muſt be Examples to the People in all virtuous car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001998_0014_0FBA4F9806B76410"/>When Miniſters teach Men their duty, they muſt be obedient, whether the Miniſter practices ſo or no. Mat. 23.3. <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they bid you obſerve, that obſerve and do: but do not ye after their works, for they ſay and do not.</hi> But Miniſters had need give good Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. 1 Tim. 4.12. <hi>Be thou an example of the believers in word, in converſation, in charity, in ſpirit, in faith, in purity.</hi> If they give a good Example, their words will ſink more into the hearts of Men. But if they addict themſelves to any vice, Men will deſpiſe them, and their counſels and warnings, they will judge they don't believe themſelves what they ſay, they will nauſeate their Preaching. It would be very unpleaſant to hear a <hi>Phariſee</hi> make a grave haurange againſt hypocriſy, and to hear a <hi>Judas</hi> declame againſt ſtealing. If Miniſters be not of good converſation, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple will count their Preaching to be art and diſſimulation: it will render them contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible in the eyes of the People. <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.8, 9. Men could hardly be patient to hear a Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kard ſpeak in the commendation of tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and a wanton Man enlarge in the commendation of chaſtity.</p>

                  <hi>A Faithful Miniſtry in a Land is a great Bleſſing.</hi> If God gives a People a good crop,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001998_0015_0FBA4F9955718850"/>if he give peace and health, they count they have received great Bleſſings: &amp; yet they take but little notice of the mercy of God in giving a faithful Miniſtry unto them; but God reckons this a great mercy. Jer. 3.15. <hi>I will give them Paſtors after mine own heart, that ſhall feed them with knowledge &amp; underſtanding.</hi> Amos 2.11. <hi>I raiſed up of your ſons for Prophets.</hi> They are great bleſſings on this account, that they are the Salt of the Land. If Mens Proviſions ſhould putrify for want of Salt it would be a great calamity: but if the People of the Land ſhould grow corrupt for want of a Faithful Miniſtry, that would be a far greater calamity. When they are Faithful they are a means to prevent corruption. Mal. 2.6. <hi>He walked with me in peace &amp; equity, and did turn many away from iniquity:</hi> that is great ſervice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. FOR if they ſhould be corrupt <hi>they would be a great affliction one to another.</hi> When a People carry orderly and holily they will be a great comfort one to another: they will make their converſation and ſociety plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and profitable, and they will dwell toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in unity: Religion teaches Men to love one another; but when they are corrupt they will be as thorns in one anothers ſides, Mic. 7.4. <hi>The beſt of them is as a brier, the moſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right is ſharper then a thorn-hedge.</hi> They will
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001998_0016_0FBA4F9ADC596A70"/>be reproaching and backbiting one another, blaſting the names of one another: Children will carry badly to Parents, and Parents to their Children; they will be injurious to one anothers Eſtates, cheating, oppreſſing, ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; they will be quarrelling and fighting; they will be debauching one another; they will corrupt Mens Daughters, and Wives too; they will be plagues one to another.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>THEN their Proſperity will do them hurt.</hi> If God beſtows plenty and ſucceſs on them, they will be taken with it, and it may be keep days of Thanksgiving: but they had better be without their Proſperity. Their bleſſings will become curſes, their meat will be their poiſon, their proſperity will make them more ſecure and hard hearted: they will flatter themſelves and take the more li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to be wicked, they will put falſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions on the Providence of God, and take occaſion to flatter themſelves, and take the more liberty to carry looſly, they will take a liberty to be drunken, and live an effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite life. <hi>But Jeſurun waxed fat and kicked, thou art waxen fat, thou art grown thick, thou art covered with fatneſs: therefore he forſook God that made him, and lightly eſteemed the rock of his ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> Deut. 32.15. So they will grow more covetous, their proſperity will be like oyl to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001998_0017_0FBA4FA226E5CB50"/>feed the flame, it had been better for them to have been kept poor and low. Prov. 1.32. <hi>The proſperity of fools ſhall deſtroy them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>THEY will have a great deal of Judgment.</hi> If they proſper a while it wont continue, but the wrath of God will break out like fire. God will purſue them with the tokens of his anger. When Iſrael corrupted themſelves in the Wilderneſs, the Plague came amongſt them and many fell; ſometime fiery ſerpents bit them: when they corrupted themſelves in the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> God ſent the <hi>Meſopotamians, Moabites, Midians, Ammorites and Philiſtines</hi> upon them: and brought them into great diſtreſs, <hi>Jud.</hi> 5.8. God is a jealous God and will not let their ſins go unrevenged. God has his days of Judgment, wherein they ſhall be called to an account: and then they will cry to God and he will not hear: iniquity is a root that beareth gall and wormwood, and their ſins will coſt them dear. Job. 21.17. <hi>God diſtributeth ſorrows in his anger.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>MULTITUDES of them will periſh.</hi> When Religion flouriſhes among a People, they don't all go to Heaven when they die: many have but a name that they live; there is chaff as well as wheat; there be fooliſh Virgins a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Wiſe. But when it is a corrupt time
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001998_0018_0FBA4FA32350B1F8"/>few are converted, the means of Grace are much blaſted; Men are minding their carnal enjoyments more than Heaven: they have great temptations, and the temptations have great power, and few of them will find their way to Heaven; there will be but a ſmall number of godly Men, they will fail much as in <hi>Sauls</hi> time. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Help Lord for the godly man ceaſeth, for the faithful fail from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the children of men.</hi> They will depend much upon their privileges and outward ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices; and generally as they dye they will go to hell: hell will be ſtocked with them: an evil generation, is a generation of God's wrath. So when Chriſt was here, Mat. 8.12. <hi>The children of the kingdom ſhall caſt out into outer darkneſs, there ſhall be wailing and gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of teeth.</hi>

                  <hi>PEOPLE had need be careful that they don't provoke God to give them ſuch a Miniſtry as will be like unſavoury Salt.</hi> Sometimes God doth leave a People to ſuch a Miniſtry. Iſai. 56.10. <hi>His watchmen are blind, they are all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, that cannot bark; ſleeping; lying down, loving to ſlumber.</hi> Jer. 2.8. <hi>The Prieſts ſaid not where is the Lord, and they that handle the law knew me not, and the Paſtors have
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001998_0019_0FBA4FA89B0E25C0"/>tranſgreſſed againſt me.</hi> Zech. 11.15, 16. <hi>The Lord ſaid to me, take unto thee the inſtruments of a fooliſh ſhepherd, for I will raiſe a ſhepherd in the land, that ſhall not viſit that which is cut off,</hi> &amp;c. When God doth ſo it is in a way of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is a ſign that ſuch a People have greatly offended God, this is one way where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by God pours out his diſpleaſure upon a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking People, and when he doth ſo, they are like to grow more and more corrupt. The Scribes and Phariſees were ſuch Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, they were blind guides, and the guide and the people both fell into the ditch; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you ſhould avoid ſuch ſins as may bring this judgment. There is often a ſuitableneſs between the ſin &amp; the puniſhment. You may do it;</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>BY barrenneſs under a Faithful Miniſtry.</hi> It is ſometimes ſo that Faithful Miniſters have very little ſucceſs, they take a great deal of pains, and there is very little effect of it: Men dote upon the World, deſpiſe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, don't regard rules, make their hearts like an adamant, make a deriſion of the aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful threatnings of the Word of God. God in this caſe ſometimes takes away their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. When the People of <hi>Judah</hi> brought forth only wild grapes, God threatens this judgment, Iſai 5.6. <hi>I will lay it waſte, and it ſhall not be pruned <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001998_0020_0FBA4FBC63751278"/>come up briars and thorns, and I will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</hi> When Men dont profit by means, it is juſt with God to take away ſuitable means. God in anger gives them up to ſtrong deluſions, ſends them ſuch teachers as ſhall miſ-lead them, and be a ſnare to them, and ſo they grow into corrupt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, they did not like ſound doctrine, and they are fitted with ſuch teachers as ſhall nouriſh a ſpirit of ſecurity in them. 2 Theſ. 2.10, 11, 12. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the truth, God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſion, that they ſhould believe a lie,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>BY abuſing a Faithful Miniſtry.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times People cannot endure ſound doctrine, and miſ-uſe God's Prophets. 2. Chron. 36.16. <hi>They mocked the meſſengers of God, and deſpiſed his word, and miſ-uſed his Prophets.</hi> They give them a great deal of trouble and moleſtation, they oppoſe them, contradict them, and are weakning their hands in their work. Sometimes they talk againſt them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.30. Sometimes they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them. This is a great provocation to God, and he many times puniſhes them, by leaving them to a corrupt and carnal Miniſtry, that will do them little good, and <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to ſuch as will do them a great deal of hurt. Thus God dealt with
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001998_0021_0FBA4FBD899212C0"/>the People of Iſrael, they abuſed the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets that God had ſent unto them; and God took vengeance on them by leaving them to falſe Prophets that deluded them, and were occaſion of their ruin. Lam. 2.14. <hi>Thy Prophets have ſeen vain and fooliſh things for thee.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>BY counting their Miniſtry a burden.</hi> Sometimes a ſordid ſpirit prevails among a People, and they count their Miniſters <hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>charge.</hi> They can laviſh away a great deal in a Year, for the gratification of their pride and voluptuouſneſs, and ſpend freely upon many frivolous occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the ſupport of the Worſhip of God is counted a great burden: God may juſtly remove faithful teachers in a way of anger for this, and leave them to ſuch tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers as ſhall not profit them. God is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry when they think much to maintain his Worſhip, God gives them wherewith to do it, and he doth ſo, that they may do it, and they provoke him, when they think that ill ſpent that is laid out that way. <hi>If Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſow unto them ſpiritual things, it is not a great thing if they reap their carnal things.</hi> 1 Cor. 9.11.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>LET this be the care of Miniſters.</hi> Miniſters muſt do their Office in being the Salt of the Land. We find great complaint of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Miniſters before the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, in <hi>Iſaiah, Jeremiah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> And after the Captivity in <hi>Ezra, Nehemiah,</hi> and <hi>Malachi.</hi> Miniſters muſt not only be careful that they don't corrupt the Land by evil manners and falſe Doctrine; but alſo that they don't by their negligence ſuffer the People to corrupt themſelves. It is a great fault in Miniſters when they don't diligently ſtudy the mind of God, but ſpend their time in viſits and wordly buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. 1 Tim. 4.15. <hi>Meditate upon theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them.</hi> And it is very blameable in them, when they Preach things that they have not duly ſtudied. And it is a great ſin in them, when they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to deal faithfully, and to bear a teſtimony againſt the ſins of the Land. If the Land be corrupted by their default, they will bring down the Anger of God upon themſelves: if they countenance the ſins of the Land, if they do not their duty for the preventing the ſins of the Land, they will make themſelves partakers of other
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001998_0023_0FBA4FC063C44BB8"/>Mens ſins; and it will be a dreadful thing for God to charge the ſins of the Land on them. As, Mal. 2.8. <hi>Ye have cauſed many to ſtumble at the law.</hi> But if they be ſerviceable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their place, to keep the Land from being corrupted, God will reward them for it: He will be ready to acknowledge their ſervice. As, Mal. 2.6. <hi>The law of truth was in his mouth, iniquity was not found in his lips, he walked with me in peace and equity;</hi> and it will be a great honour and comfort to them, that they have been inſtruments of the holineſs of the Land: when the <hi>Sons of Levi are purified, the offerings of Judah will be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God.</hi> As, Mal. 3.3, 4.</p>
               <p>THERE are four things that Miniſters ſhould labour in to prevent the Corruption of the Land.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THAT there be a good number of the People ſavingly Converted.</hi> Miniſters ſhould labour to convert as many as poſſible, not only out of a reſpect to the Salvation of their Souls, but to prevent the Corruption of the Land. If Men are converted they will lead holy lives. 1 Joh. 3.9. <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not.</hi> Men that are converted are not ſo apt to drink in falſe Doctrine as other Men; and they will have a great influence
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001998_0024_0FBA4FC208BF1ED8"/>upon the converſation of others; but an unconverted generation will be a corrupt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. <hi>Judg.</hi> 2.10, 11. Converted Men will teach their Children the ways of God, and diſcountenance ſinful practices: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Men will be good Examples: yea, they will ſavour of divine things, and thereby ſtir up that light that is in the conſciences of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. If Men that are converted have power, they will improve it for God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>THAT godly Men be kept in a flouriſhing condition.</hi> Converted Men may be in a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering condition, and be carried away with a worldly ſpirit; but Miniſters ſhould be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to keep them in a thriving way, that their Souls may be in a proſperous condition, that they may be in an healthy eſtate, and enjoy much of the preſence of God. If godly Men be under decays, as ſometimes they are, Rev. 2.4. <hi>Loſing their firſt love,</hi> that will be a da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the religion of a country. When they flouriſh they will walk more exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the rules of the Goſpel, they will be more zealous for God, they will more ſtrongly reſiſt temptation, they will be more ſavoury, and their diſcourſes will be more edifying. Pſal. 45.1. Their hearts will <hi>endita good matter, and their tongues will be as the pen of a ready writer.</hi> They will be more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:001998_0025_0FBA4FD06D972098"/>and others, will be loath to grieve them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>THAT the Conſciences of natural Men be kept tender.</hi> Miniſters muſt labour to poſſeſs Men with a deep ſenſe of the jealouſy of God, and of the terrible Judgments that God executes for ſin; they ſhould be often ſetting matter of terror before Men, remembring them of Eternal puniſhments, of the awful ways wherein God takes vengeance on impenitent Sinners, that they may be afraid of Sin. 2 Cor. 5.11. <hi>Knowing the terrors of the Lord we perſwade men.</hi> If their conſciences be awakened, they will reſtrain them from ſinful practices, and bridle in their corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Mat. 19.20. <hi>All theſe things have I done from my youth.</hi> Their fear will diſpoſe them to lead a religious life, and make them forbear ways of iniquity: Though deſtitute of Grace, yet they will carry them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves commendably.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>THAT they be well principled againſt the errors and vices of the age.</hi> Ignorance expoſes a People to corrupt carriages: if Mens prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples be erroneous they will carry badly, whether they be godly or ungodly. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.16. If Men miſtake the rule, conſcience will allow them to break it; yea, will force them to break it: But if Conſcience be duly
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:001998_0026_0FBA4FD24C97A200"/>informed, many natural men will not dare to go againſt their light. Therefore Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould be careful to principle the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aright, about the nature of true Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, about true ſigns of Grace, and about moral duties. Many Men are carried away with the corrupt practices of the Land, into ways of <hi>pride, injuſtice,</hi> and <hi>licenciouſneſs,</hi> becauſe they think they are lawful. If they were well taught they would reform. The Word of God would be like fire in them; they would not dare to do ſuch things as now they do. When any ill practice prevails, the Miniſter ſhould do as <hi>John</hi> did, Mat. 14.4. <hi>John ſaid to him it is not lawful for then to have her.</hi>
