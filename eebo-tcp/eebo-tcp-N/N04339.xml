            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE have heard of the <hi>Patience of Job,</hi> and ſeen the <hi>End of the</hi> LORD; which ſome excellent <hi>Expoſitors</hi> have ſaid was to give an early and <hi>illuſtrious Type</hi> of the <hi>Humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of</hi> CHRIST, and <hi>his Sufferings,</hi> in his Way to Glory and <hi>Exaltation,</hi> as our <hi>Interceſſor</hi> at the right Hand of GOD.</p>
            <p>Among the many excelling Examples and <hi>Patterns</hi> given us thro' the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> of <hi>Suffering</hi> Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Patience, no One is more remarkable, noble and illuſtrious, teaching and affecting than that of JOB'S; in the ſurpriſing <hi>firſt and ſecond</hi> Aſſault of <hi>Satan</hi> upon his <hi>Family, Eſtate</hi> and <hi>Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Sovereign and gracious GOD had prov'd <hi>his Grace</hi> in this his Servant in a long <hi>proſperous State;</hi> and now was pleas'd to make a ſudden <hi>Change</hi> upon him, for an equal <hi>Diſplay</hi> of the Power and Glory of his Grace in a State of <hi>deepeſt Affliction.</hi>

               <hi>Satan</hi> was greedy of a Permiſſion to tempt and <hi>ſift</hi> him, as he afterward was to try <hi>Peter.</hi> The cruel <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil</hi> ſpoil'd him of his Subſtance, and bereaved him of his <hi>Children</hi> and Servants in one Day; and that in ſo terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and <hi>judicial</hi> a Manner as might ſpeak moſt dreadful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the immediate Hand and utmoſt Indignation of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven:</hi> But failing of his <hi>Wiſh,</hi> hereby to provoke him to <hi>curſe</hi> GOD; he ask'd a further Permiſſion to <hi>ſmite his Body</hi> from Head to Foot, with <hi>Boils</hi> and fiery <hi>Ulcers,</hi> extreamly <hi>painful</hi> and tormenting, as well as <hi>filthy</hi> and loathſome. It was the Pleaſure of <hi>Sovereign Grace,</hi> to permit <hi>this</hi> alſo, that the <hi>Trial of Faith</hi> in his <hi>choſen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> might be found to <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Honour and Glory</hi> thro' all Generations of the <hi>Church</hi> on Earth, and at the <hi>Day</hi> of the Coming of CHRIST to Judgment.</p>
            <p>But no Word <hi>amiſs</hi> falling from the afflicted <hi>Saint,</hi> in this his <hi>deſtitute and tormented</hi> State; no Words but of <hi>profound</hi> Humility, Reſignation, Worſhip and Thankſgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, dropping from his Lips; the ſubtle <hi>Tempter</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpent all his outward <hi>Forces,</hi> betook himſelf to his helliſh <hi>Craft</hi> and Policy, and annoy'd his gracious <hi>Soul</hi> with diabolical <hi>Suggeſtions</hi> and <hi>blaſphemous</hi> Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt GOD; to ſecond him in which he excited his <hi>Wife,</hi> whom the ſpiteful <hi>Fiend</hi> ſeems to have left to him on Deſign to make <hi>her</hi> his <hi>Tempter</hi> and Tormentor.— So he afterward grieved our bleſſed SAVIOUR; againſt whom not prevailing by more immediate Aſſaults in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> he us'd the unwary and raſh Lips of <hi>Peter,</hi> and got him that juſt Rebuke, <hi>"Get thee behind me, Satan.</hi>

            <p>Her Words in my <hi>Text</hi> are very <hi>groſs,</hi> and ſmell rank of <hi>Hell; Then ſaid his Wife to him, Doſt thou ſtill retain thy Integrity? curſe GOD and die.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Sometimes the <hi>Devil has hurried</hi> poor Souls with <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical</hi> Thoughts; for he finds <hi>an evil Heart of Unbelief</hi> within us, and foments it at Times, to high Degrees of <hi>Infidelity;</hi> ſo as not only to queſtion the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and therein of JESUS, <hi>GOD manifeſt in Fleſh;</hi> but alſo the very <hi>Being</hi> and incomprehenſible neceſſary <hi>Perfections</hi> of the DEITY; his <hi>Eternity,</hi> perfect <hi>Preſcience</hi> and <hi>Decrees;</hi> which are indeed as the <hi>thick Darkneſs,</hi> or rather <hi>unapproachable Light</hi> wherein the ETERNAL dwells; and into which it may be the <hi>Angels</hi> of Heaven are no more allow'd to <hi>pry</hi> with any Thought of ſearching them out, than the <hi>Church</hi> of old in the <hi>Wilderneſs</hi> was permitted to come near unto the <hi>Bounds</hi> about the <hi>Mount</hi> to <hi>gaze;</hi> into which if they had <hi>look'd,</hi> what could they have <hi>ſeen</hi> but Cloud and Lightning?</p>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p n="3">III.

            <p>The Support and <hi>Relief</hi> of ſuch diſtreſſed Souls, and to <hi>convince</hi> them of their <hi>Error,</hi> I had principally in Mind in the Choice of this <hi>Subject;</hi> although I take it not to have been the very <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Caſe</hi> with <hi>Job,</hi> who was too <hi>intelligent</hi> and eſtabliſh'd a Worſhipper of GOD to be driven from the happy <hi>Confidence</hi> of his <hi>Integrity</hi> and Uprightneſs, by the Aſſaults of <hi>Satan</hi> or by the <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> of his <hi>Friends:</hi> He <hi>appeal'd</hi> from <hi>them</hi> unto GOD the Searcher of the <hi>Heart,</hi> and who knows all Things, that He <hi>knew he loved Him:</hi> Chap. x. v. 7. <hi>Thou knoweſt that I am not wicked!</hi> and in his <hi>laſt Reply,</hi> he finiſh'd with a long <hi>Train</hi> of noble <hi>Appeal</hi> to GOD and Affirmations to Men: Chap. xxvii. <q>As GOD <hi>liveth</hi> who hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away my Judgment, and the ALMIGHTY who hath vexed my Soul; all the while my <hi>Breath</hi> is in me and the <hi>Spirit</hi> of GOD is in my Noſtrils; my <hi>Lips</hi> ſhall not ſpeak Wickedneſs, nor my Tongue utter <hi>Deceit:</hi> GOD forbid that I ſhould <hi>juſtify</hi> you; <hi>'till I die I will not deny my Integrity:</hi> My Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs <hi>I hold faſt</hi> and will not let it go; my Heart ſhall <hi>not reproach</hi> me as long as I live.</q>
            </p>
            <p>But alas! how <hi>few</hi> of the dear <hi>Children of GOD</hi> in our Days arrive at like <hi>ſteddy</hi> full <hi>Aſſurance</hi> of Faith as <hi>Job</hi> had, reſpecting their <hi>Integrity!</hi> they are too often <hi>ſoon ſhaken in Mind;</hi> though we are admoniſhed by the HOLY GHOST <hi>not</hi> to be ſo on one Account and another. 2 Theſſ. ii. 2.

            <p>But what now lies before us, is to affirm and <hi>prove</hi> that there may be the <hi>fouleſt Motions</hi> to Sin, made by <hi>Satan</hi> to the Minds and Hearts of the moſt <hi>ſincere</hi> and <hi>pious</hi> among the People of GOD; as <hi>this</hi> in the <hi>Text</hi> was to <hi>Job, "Curſe GOD and die!</hi> and yet if their Soul

            </p>
            <p>Let us <hi>reaſon</hi> and argue a little on this <hi>Point.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The meer <hi>thinking</hi> on Sin, or the Contemplation of it with <hi>Averſion</hi> of Soul, can by no Means <hi>defile</hi> the Mind. GOD Himſelf <hi>beholds</hi> Sin, <hi>thinks</hi> of it, yet is infinitely <hi>holy,</hi> and of <hi>purer Eyes than to behold Evil, and cannot look on Iniquity.</hi> Hab. i. 13. i. e. He beholds it with <hi>Abhorrence,</hi> his <hi>Soul</hi> hates it, his <hi>Word</hi> forbids, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns and threatens it. The holy <hi>Angels</hi> alſo ſee our Sins, open and ſecret, conſider and deteſt 'em; are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at and grieved by them; and it is their <hi>Holineſs.</hi> —<hi>Good Men</hi> make <hi>diligent Search</hi> and Enquiry into the Nature of <hi>Sin,</hi> their own and others among whom they dwell; diſcern the moral <hi>Evil,</hi> Guilt and Pollution of it; its Turpitude, Baſeneſs and Malignity; yet are they not <hi>defiled</hi> hereby, no but the more <hi>purified</hi> both in Heart and Life.—Regenerate Perſons and ſincere <hi>Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> find it abſolutely neceſſary for them often to call their <hi>paſt</hi> Sins to Remembrance; they can neither ſhew themſelves <hi>Men</hi> nor <hi>Chriſtians</hi> without doing ſo, for a renewed <hi>Repentance</hi> on the Account of 'em, to increaſe their <hi>Humiliation</hi> and Abaſement before GOD, to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken themſelves in the <hi>Mortification</hi> of the Body of Sin and Death which they carry about with them, to fix their

               <hi>Abhorrence</hi> of it and of themſelves for it, and to ſtrengthen their <hi>Watch</hi> againſt every Motion to it, from within or from without;—but all this is according to <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> and <hi>purifying</hi> to the Soul in <hi>obeying the Truth.</hi>—Now it is the ſame Thing in the Event, thro' the <hi>Grace of GOD</hi> with and in his <hi>Saints,</hi> if vile and wicked Thoughts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe <hi>involuntarily</hi> in 'em, or are thrown and caſt in upon them by <hi>Satan</hi> without and againſt their Will: If the Soul in either Caſe riſe againſt them in <hi>Fear,</hi> in Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in Hatred and <hi>loathing</hi> of them; Iniquity is but <hi>purged away</hi> hereby, and the Soul <hi>confirmed</hi> in holy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and the <hi>Habit</hi> of Grace is ſtrengthned. As if you <hi>rinſe</hi> a very foul Veſſel, though it be in <hi>dirty</hi> Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet it will be ſomething the <hi>cleaner</hi> for it; the <hi>Dirt</hi> at the Bottom will be in Part (at leaſt) looſned, and caſt out with the Water; ſo here, though the Injection of <hi>Satan</hi> be never ſo unclean and defiling in it ſelf, yet the Soul <hi>ſpuing out</hi> the foul Thought, <hi>caſts up</hi> alſo ſomething further of its natural Impurity together with it.</p>
            <p>Indeed there is a Contemplation or <hi>thinking</hi> of Sin that is moſt <hi>impure</hi> and defiling: To think of it with <hi>liking</hi> and Complacency or Deſire is highly ſo; to <hi>crave,</hi> intend, and project it, to muſe and dwell on it with Pleaſure, to <hi>roll it as a ſweet Morſel under our Tongue</hi> with Taſte and Reliſh; to recollect it with Delight and <hi>chaw</hi> it over again as the <hi>Cud,</hi> (which is to <hi>injure</hi> the wholſome Property of the <hi>clean</hi> Creatures) this is to <hi>liſten</hi> to the Tempter with Inclination and Conſent, and call the forbidden Fruit <hi>good</hi> for Sight and Taſte, and is <hi>groſly</hi> polluting to the Soul; as alſo in a <hi>Degree</hi> it is, not to have our Hearts <hi>riſe againſt,</hi> and <hi>fly from</hi> every Motion within us to known Sin. For in this Caſe <hi>Luſt lodges,</hi> is <hi>harbour'd</hi> and entertained, <hi>conceives</hi> and brings forth; and is ſo much <hi>real</hi> Adultery, Murder, Profa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Heart: Matth. v. 12. But on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to think of <hi>Sin</hi> with Grief and <hi>Mourning,</hi> Fear and Confuſion, Indignation and Rejection, this is <hi>purgative</hi> and purifying, <hi>wholſome</hi> and healthful, <hi>medicinal</hi> and
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:005366_0039_101825C7DDCF7070"/>reſtorative, nouriſhing and <hi>ſtrengthning</hi> to a <hi>Principle of Grace,</hi> in <hi>Act</hi> and Exerciſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it be moreover conſider'd, that the very <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> I am upon <hi>ſuppoſes</hi> the abhorred deteſted Thoughts <hi>injected by another,</hi> and that they do <hi>not come</hi> or proceed from the <hi>Soul it ſelf,</hi> nor are originally its <hi>own,</hi> and that the Soul is <hi>grieved</hi> by 'em, <hi>offended</hi> at 'em, <hi>diſowns</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects 'em: they are therefore ſome <hi>ſpurious Births</hi> from abroad, laid <hi>ſecretly</hi> and baſely at our <hi>Door,</hi> or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it, and <hi>falſly father'd on us,</hi> if we are <hi>ſo fooliſh</hi> as to receive and <hi>own</hi> them. If we conſent not, 'tis only the <hi>Devil's Sin;</hi> his Act, his Guilt and he muſt anſwer for it. If for Inſtance, the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> had done as the SECOND did; if our <hi>firſt</hi> Parents, had <hi>rebuk'd</hi> the Tempter and <hi>deteſted</hi> his Motion to them, when he perſuaded them to <hi>diſbelieve</hi> and diſobey GOD; the <hi>Sin</hi> had reſted only on the <hi>Devil;</hi> they had remained <hi>innocent</hi> and been <hi>confirm'd</hi> in Holineſs; but they <hi>yeilded</hi> to his curſed Suggeſtion, took <hi>part</hi> in his Act and in his <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> from GOD.</p>
            <p>Indeed, now in our <hi>fallen</hi> State we have juſt <hi>Reaſon</hi> to ſuſpect our Selves and <hi>fear always,</hi> ſometimes <hi>more</hi> than at other, whether the vile <hi>Motions</hi> to Sin within us be not from our <hi>own Hearts, which are deceitful above all things</hi> and deſperately wicked; <hi>who can know them?</hi> No wonder therefore if the <hi>holieſt</hi> Child or Servant of GOD be ſometimes ready to ſay, <q>I fear it is <hi>Sin dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and reigning in me, and the Hand of the <hi>Devil</hi> is it may be <hi>little</hi> in it; for as St. <hi>James</hi> ſays "<hi>Every Man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own Luſt and enticed;</hi> and how ſhall I <hi>know</hi> but that it is <hi>thus</hi> with me?</q>
            </p>
            <p>But let us call in the <hi>Aid</hi> of the bleſſed St. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſet this matter in its true Light; and it is well for the <hi>Church</hi> that it has theſe <hi>two Apoſtles</hi> to give Light into each others Meaning.

And all the Angels ſtood round about the Throne, and about the Elders, and the four Beaſts, and fell before the Throne on their Faces, and worſhipped GOD, ſaying, Amen: Bleſſing, and Glory, and Wiſdom, and Thankſgiving, and Honour, and Power, and Might be unto our GOD for ever and ever. Amen. And one of the Elders anſwered, ſaying unto me, What are theſe which are arrayed in white Robes? and whence came they? And I ſaid unto him, Sir, thou knoweſt. And he ſaid to me, Theſe are they which came out of great Tribulation, and have waſhed their Robes, and made them white in the Blood of the Lamb. Therefore are they before the Throne of

They ſhall hunger no more, neither thirſt any more, neither ſhall the Sun light on them, nor any Heat. For the Lamb which is in the midſt of the Throne ſhall feed them, and ſhall lead them unto living Fountains of Waters: and GOD ſhall wipe away all Tears from their Eyes.</hi>

            <p n="2">II. Let the <hi>ſecond Uſe</hi> be of <hi>Caution</hi> in two or three <hi>Particulars,</hi> wherein we may elſe do Wrong to the <hi>Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine</hi> before us and miſimprove it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us beware of <hi>imputing to the Devil</hi> too much of <hi>our own Sin and Guilt,</hi> the corrupt Workings of our own Hearts. We have <hi>Sin dwelling in us,</hi> and muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how we are admoniſhed by the HOLY GHOST, that <hi>every Man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own Luſt and enticed.</hi> James. i. 14. The <hi>regenerate</hi> have the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains and Luſting of Sin within them; and in its <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence</hi> at times the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> charges it on indwelling Sin; Rom. vii. 17, 20. <hi>It is Sin which dwelleth in me.</hi> We muſt by no means ſay, that the <hi>Agency of the Devil</hi> is in every <hi>Temptation</hi> which Men ſuffer, or <hi>Sin</hi> which they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: Neither can we ſay, that his Hand <hi>is not</hi> in this or that Sin: He is inviſible, and our own wicked Hearts act ſo in <hi>Conjunction</hi> with him, that ſometimes which is moſt to blame is not to be ſaid. It is <hi>beſt</hi> for the <hi>Sinner,</hi> often to take it wholly to <hi>himſelf,</hi> but too <hi>common</hi> to hear him laying it to the <hi>Devil. Satan</hi> moved <hi>David</hi> to num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the People, and <hi>Satan</hi> filled the Heart of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> to lie unto the HOLY GHOST. — Only where the <hi>Injection is involuntary,</hi> without and againſt a Perſon's Will; where it is <hi>violent</hi> unnatural, a horror and torment to a Perſon, there it may be reaſonably attributed to the <hi>Devil,</hi> his Malice and Force. But ordinarily it is wiſe and beſt to <hi>charge our ſelves,</hi> humble abaſe and loathe our ſelves before GOD. Yet it may be utterly <hi>wrong</hi> to accuſe, <hi>condemn,</hi> torment our ſelves, where we are only annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <hi>aſſaulted</hi> and tempted, without our <hi>yeilding</hi> to the deteſted Motion. — In <hi>Temptations</hi> to Sin, that are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with <hi>Profit and Pleaſure</hi> our own Hearts may in all likelyhood be the <hi>principal,</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> only acceſſary: Or if he is <hi>firſt</hi> in the Motion and there be our Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we are <hi>acceſſary</hi> in the Crime, and muſt ſmite upon our own Breaſt. Yet the <hi>Caſe</hi> too often is, that <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>leud</hi> People tempt the Devil to tempt them; or are ſo habituated to and ſet upon their wicked Ways, that they need no <hi>Tempter</hi> beſides themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another <hi>Extream</hi> we ſhould be caution'd againſt is, of making <hi>too light</hi> of this Doctrine of the <hi>Annoyances</hi> which gracious Souls ſometimes meet with from diabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical and helliſh Suggeſtions of <hi>Satan.</hi> It is, I am ſenſible, a <hi>ridiculous</hi> kind of Suggeſtion againſt the <hi>Devil,</hi> in the Opinion of <hi>many</hi> at this Day. Many a <hi>Free-thinker</hi> may be ready to <hi>ſcoff</hi> at it as fanatical, whimſical, ſplenetic, <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> and what not. Some <hi>virtuous</hi> Perſons may be <hi>too far</hi> in ſuch a Tho't; becauſe they have never <hi>felt</hi> any thing of it <hi>themſelves,</hi> and thro' the Favour of GOD it is not the <hi>known</hi> Caſe of very many, and generally thoſe few by <hi>Conſtitution</hi> of Body ſubject to Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly. — Others it may be, of the <hi>Children</hi> of GOD, may d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. A third <hi>Caution</hi> which I would put in is, that we <hi>do not allow our ſelves to queſtion the Juſtice and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Divine Permiſſion;</hi> or to entertain <hi>hard Tho'ts of the bleſſed</hi> GOD on this Account. — Alas! we are no <hi>Judges</hi> of what the Sovereign GOD may do or can do; or of the <hi>Rights</hi> and Wiſdom of his Government: We have not yet been in the <hi>Worlds of Spirits,</hi> to ſee their various Natures, States, Orders and Services in the <hi>Creation of</hi> GOD.

So <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>David</hi> were educated long in the <hi>School</hi> of Affliction, and fitted for their <hi>Princely</hi> State and Glories. — And the <hi>greater</hi> the <hi>Fight of Affliction</hi> be, the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is the <hi>Victory,</hi> and the greater the <hi>Triumph.</hi>

V. I come now to the <hi>fifth</hi> and <hi>laſt Uſe,</hi> which is of <hi>Counſel and Direction;</hi> what <hi>Rules</hi> to give for <hi>Support</hi> againſt, and for <hi>Deliverance</hi> from ſuch curſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viliſh <hi>Suggeſtions</hi> and Annoyances, as we have been treating of.</p>
            <p>Now the repeated <hi>Rule</hi> to us is in general <hi>this, Jam.</hi> iv. 7. <hi>Reſiſt the Devil and he ſhall flee from you:</hi> 1 Pet. v. 9. <hi>Whom reſiſt, ſtedfaſt in the Faith.</hi> We muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe, deny, oppoſe, repulſe, reſolutely and ſtedfaſtly: And to help us in doing ſo,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let us <hi>get</hi> and ever <hi>preſerve</hi> right <hi>Conceptions</hi> of the DIVINE BEING; even thoſe <hi>vaſt</hi> and <hi>awful</hi> and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ones which the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Works</hi> of GOD ſupply us with. Theſe let us be <hi>frequently</hi> calling to Mind, ſo as to <hi>fix</hi> them in our Minds, with great Solemnity. Let us uſe our ſelves to <hi>think</hi> often of GOD, and ever <hi>ſpeak</hi> of Him with great Seriouſneſs and Reverence; never <hi>lightly</hi> or vainly. — I do not ſay that the <hi>Habit</hi> of this <hi>will keep us</hi> from the Temptations of <hi>Satan,</hi> nor make 'em <hi>leſs tormenting</hi> to us; no, the <hi>Torture</hi> of it is from the <hi>greater Reverence</hi> we have of GOD; but it will <hi>arm and fortify</hi> us againſt the Temptations, and <hi>ſtrengthen</hi> us to reſiſt them.</p>
            <p>For how can I be won't to think of GOD aright, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Excellent MAJESTY, Holineſs, Goodneſs, Wiſdom; his Eternity, Immenſity, Sovereign Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Power; his Truth Grace and Mercy; my Creator, Preſerver; Saviour, Sanctifier and heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and yet <hi>bear</hi> to have any Thing mean, baſe, vile ſuggeſted to me of Him; or that any ſuch Thought ſhould riſe within me againſt him! No, the better we know what GOD is, the <hi>more</hi> ſhall we eſteem, admire, venerate, love and joy in Him, and the <hi>leſs</hi> ſhall we endure an <hi>unworthy</hi> Thought of Him; but our <hi>Faith</hi> will turn it into an <hi>Occaſion</hi> of a more expreſs and raiſed <hi>Adoration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. That we may <hi>defend</hi> our ſelves from, or <hi>overcome</hi> ſuch Aſſaults of the <hi>Evil One,</hi> let us diligently <hi>ſtudy the Holy Scriptures, meditate</hi> much in GOD's Law, attentively

               <hi>read</hi> his Word daily, and attend on the <hi>preaching</hi> of it with Reverence, Meekneſs and Love.

"<hi>It is written,</hi> ſaid our <hi>Holy</hi> SAVIOUR, and ſo he has taught us to <hi>ſhame and put to Flight the Armies of the Aliens.</hi> The <hi>Devil</hi> can't have the <hi>Face</hi> to ſay to us, as he did to <hi>Eve, "Yea, has GOD ſaid?</hi> when we open our <hi>Bible</hi> to him, and ſhew him the written <hi>Text;</hi> written by the <hi>Finger</hi> of GOD himſelf, concerning <hi>Himſelf.</hi> At <hi>other</hi> Debate or Argument he may be too <hi>hard</hi> for us, but keep to <hi>this</hi> and there can be no <hi>Reply</hi> or Evaſion.

            <p>Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> tells us, that of forty or <hi>fifty</hi> Perſons, who have been at a Time known to him, under the Oppreſſion of <hi>blaſphemous</hi> and vile Thoughts, there have not been <hi>four or five</hi> but were ſenſibly under the Power of <hi>Melancholly,</hi> either from their natural <hi>Temperament,</hi> or from <hi>croſs</hi> Providences, or ſome Spice of <hi>Diſcontent</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their outward Circumſtances.

            <p n="6">6. That afflicted <hi>tempted Perſons make not too great a Matter of their moleſting Thoughts;</hi> which they are very <hi>prone</hi> to do, and they give <hi>Tempter</hi> a great <hi>Advantage</hi> thereby. <hi>Non multum volvat et revolvat Cogitationes iſtas,</hi> ſays the very pious, judicious and learned <hi>Van Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricht:</hi> "Don't keep <hi>poring</hi> on and <hi>revolving</hi> in your Minds the Moleſtations given you; but humbly <hi>obteſt</hi> and <hi>plead</hi> before GOD your utter <hi>Averſion</hi> to them, with <hi>Thankfulneſs</hi> to GOD for it; and beg of him to enable you not to <hi>lay 'em ſo to Heart,</hi> as to be <hi>hinder'd by 'em</hi> in Matters of <hi>preſent Duty,</hi> toward GOD, your ſelves, your Families or Neighbours.

            <p>I remember the <hi>Venerable Mr. Baxter</hi> ſpeaks on this <hi>Argument</hi> in the following Manner, <q>If you make a great Matter of every <hi>Thought</hi> that is <hi>caſt</hi> into your Mind, you keep 'em the <hi>longer</hi> in Mind, and 'tis the Way to <hi>fix</hi> 'em there.

He will take you off from <hi>greater</hi> Duties and from <hi>all</hi> Duties, if you ſtay to <hi>wrangle</hi> with him.</q>— As the <hi>Arch-Angel rail'd not</hi> again at the <hi>raving Devil,</hi> but only ſaid "<hi>the LORD rebuke thee;</hi> ſo anſwer and <hi>rebuke</hi> the Injections of <hi>Satan,</hi> and <hi>argue not</hi> with him.—Yea, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after a <hi>placid Submiſſion</hi> to the Will of GOD in his <hi>holy Permiſſion</hi> of them.

            <p n="7">7. Make Conſcience of <hi>daily</hi> exerciſing your ſelves in <hi>Adoration, Bleſſing, Thankſgiving</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> to GOD; more eſpecially for CHRIST and the <hi>ſure Mercies</hi> of the Everlaſting <hi>Covenant</hi> of Grace, purchas'd and ratified by his <hi>Blood. In GOD I will praiſe his Word, in the LORD I have put my Truſt, I will not fear what Fleſh</hi> (or <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit) can do unto me;</hi> when they <hi>would ſwallow me up!</hi> or <hi>while fighting daily they oppreſs me.</hi> Pſalm lvi. 1, 4. This is to <hi>fly to the Rock of</hi> Salvation, and <hi>haſten our Eſcape from the windy Storm and Tempeſt.</hi> For the <hi>Name of the LORD is a ſtrong Tower, which the righteous fly to and are ſafe;</hi> and the Promiſes in CHRIST are the <hi>Anchor</hi> of our Souls in every <hi>Storm</hi> of Temptation.</p>
            <p>"Tie your ſelves daily therefore (ſays Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>) to ſpend as much Time in confeſſing <hi>Mercies receiv'd,</hi> as in confeſſing <hi>Sins committed.</hi> Be more in the <hi>Praiſes of GOD,</hi> and leſs in <hi>bewailing your ſelves.

You will find your <hi>Graces</hi> move, and <hi>Comforts</hi> flow by this Means; as when you go into <hi>Sun-ſhine</hi> you find Light and Warmth. — Or if you can't find at laſt that you have the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting Love</hi> which you deſire, you may not be able to deny but you have a <hi>deſiring</hi> ſeeking and <hi>lamenting</hi> Love.

                  <p>I Think your <hi>Difficulties</hi> are not <hi>peculiar</hi> to you, but ſuch as I have met with <hi>frequent</hi> Inſtances of; tho' Perſons under ſuch like Difficulties are ready to think them peculiar, and that <hi>no One's Caſe</hi> is like their's.—It is evident that <hi>Satan</hi>'s Deſign is to <hi>hinder</hi> their ſerving GOD, and uſing the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Means for their own Profit and Comfort; by waſting away their Time and Lives in unprofitable Exerciſes of Mind, needleſs Doubts, Scruples, Terrors, and fighting with Shadows; and it ſoon thro' Melancholly becomes <hi>natural</hi> for them to <hi>pore</hi> upon that which is unprofitable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and thereby they feed their own <hi>Diſeaſe,</hi> and <hi>involve</hi> themſelves more and more, till they get an <hi>Averſion</hi> to, and <hi>object</hi> moſt againſt, thoſe <hi>Things</hi> which have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Tendency to their <hi>Relief:</hi> There is a certain <hi>Gloom</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Mind which the <hi>Devil</hi> makes great Advantage of; for it weakens the Mind and diſables it from guarding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him; to his utmoſt therefore he ſtrives to <hi>increaſe</hi> that Gloom; (for he ſees that the <hi>Mind</hi> while under it is like <hi>a City without Walls</hi>) and to that End will ever now and then be caſting in ſome <hi>horrid Tho't,</hi> or fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Suggeſtion, or Temptation: And if the Perſon in ſuch
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:005366_0090_1018265FAE501FF8"/>a Caſe goes to <hi>diſpute</hi> with him, or <hi>fight</hi> againſt him, he often makes his <hi>Advantage</hi> of that very diſputing and fighting; and by that Means <hi>plunges</hi> the Soul deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and deeper, and entangles it more and more. The beſt Way of <hi>reſiſting</hi> the ſubtle and ſtrong Adverſary is to <hi>neglect</hi> him, turn <hi>from</hi> him, and not <hi>enter</hi> into Diſputes with him; nor take ſo much <hi>Notice</hi> of his Suggeſtions, however frightful and horrid, as to be <hi>alarm'd</hi> with them: For if he has once alarm'd and <hi>affrighted</hi> the Soul, then he has gain'd a great <hi>Advantage</hi> againſt it, and he will be ſure to <hi>improve</hi> it to his utmoſt.—The beſt Way is for a Perſon to <hi>look unto GOD</hi> for Help, and <hi>go right on his Way,</hi> and not <hi>ſtand to hear</hi> what the Devil has to ſay. This above any other Courſe <hi>diſappoints</hi> him, for hereby he <hi>loſes his Opportunity</hi> to try his Strength and <hi>Subtilty</hi> with us; for he knows well that if he can <hi>draw</hi> into a Diſpute with him he ſhall be too <hi>ſubtil</hi> for us: A <hi>Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to go ſtedfaſtly right forward in the Way of <hi>Duty</hi> and of <hi>all</hi> Duty, (if one could maintain it) without ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>ſtill,</hi> or turning <hi>aſide,</hi> is one of the beſt <hi>Remedies</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch ſort of Difficulties.—The great <hi>Strife</hi> of the Devil is to weaken and <hi>break</hi> ſuch Perſons <hi>Reſolution</hi> and Stedfaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the Way of Duty, and either by <hi>Terror</hi> or <hi>Perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> to make 'em <hi>neglect ſome Ordinance,</hi> or ſome Duty of our <hi>general</hi> or particular <hi>Calling;</hi> ſome Duty of <hi>Worſhip,</hi> or ſome neceſſary <hi>worldly Buſineſs;</hi> or ſomething that Providence <hi>calls</hi> us to, by which we might <hi>profit</hi> our Selves, our <hi>Families,</hi> our <hi>Neighbours</hi> or the public <hi>Societies</hi> unto which we belong. And I have obſerv'd that Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons under ſuch Circumſtances, being in <hi>Darkneſs</hi> and Doubts of the <hi>State</hi> of their Souls, <hi>generally take a wrong Courſe</hi> to obtain Satisfaction: they ſpend all their Time almoſt <hi>in anxious poring on paſt Experiences,</hi> and <hi>viewing 'em over and over:</hi> Not but that they <hi>ought to examine</hi> paſt Experience; but this is not <hi>all,</hi> nor yet the <hi>main</hi> Thing they have to do: Deliverance from Doubts and Darkneſs, in ſuch <hi>Caſes,</hi> is not obtain'd chiefly <hi>by Self-Examination,</hi> but <hi>Action</hi> I have always obſerv'd that when Perſons inſtead of <hi>applying</hi> themſelves with all their
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:005366_0091_101826615C6E8C98"/>Might to <hi>ſeek GOD</hi> and his Grace, and to <hi>ſerve him, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the Things that are behind,</hi> and <hi>preſſing forward</hi> in the Way of all Duty, as tho' they <hi>counted not themſelves to have apprehended;</hi> I ſay, when inſtead of <hi>this,</hi> they <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their great Work,</hi> and <hi>abandon themſelves to muſing, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and looking over Things that are paſt;</hi> they get <hi>nothing</hi> by it: A ſpending <hi>ſeven Years</hi> in thus examining <hi>paſt</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences or <hi>preſent</hi> Circumſtances, brings 'em <hi>no nearer</hi> to Satisfaction; but rather <hi>intangles</hi> and <hi>perplexes</hi> their Minds more and more, and gives <hi>Satan</hi> greater Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: And however with their examining themſelves they do as they <hi>think</hi> ſtrive to <hi>go on</hi> in a Way of <hi>Duty,</hi> yet in their <hi>ſeeking GOD</hi> they commonly err in <hi>four</hi> Things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. They ſeek him with an <hi>unſubmiſſive Spirit.</hi> It is true they ſometimes ſeek <hi>earneſtly</hi> and with <hi>Bitterneſs of Soul;</hi> but there is commonly <hi>a Sort of Uneaſineſs,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>Tumultuouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Unquietneſs</hi> of Spirit; which ſhows a <hi>Want</hi> of that <hi>humble, meek, calm</hi> and ſubmiſſive Spirit, that becomes a poor <hi>unworthy Worm,</hi> and more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or a <hi>Child of GOD,</hi> when GOD <hi>frowns</hi> or <hi>hides his Face.</hi> I have often ſeen <hi>this;</hi> they have ſome Degree of that <hi>Frame</hi> which <hi>Job</hi> had before <hi>Elihu</hi> ſpake, and GOD after him out of the <hi>Whirlwind;</hi> they <hi>complain</hi> "that they <hi>cry to GOD</hi> and he does <hi>not anſwer,</hi> they <hi>ſeek</hi> him but they cannot <hi>find</hi> him; "<hi>they go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but he is not there; and backward but they can't per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive him!</hi> He ſeems to <hi>ſhut out their Prayer, and turn a deaf Ear</hi> to them. But I have known many <hi>Inſtances</hi> of ſuch as made theſe <hi>Complaints,</hi> being brought afterwards by the Grace of GOD to ſeek him after quite <hi>another</hi> Manner; to lie as it were at his <hi>Foot,</hi> in a humble ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive <hi>quiet</hi> Frame of Spirit, in a great Senſe of their utter <hi>Unworthineſs,</hi> and of GOD's Holineſs and <hi>Sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and ſo remaining in a calm <hi>waiting</hi> Frame; when once they have been brought to <hi>this,</hi> all their <hi>Clouds</hi> have been <hi>ſcatter'd,</hi> and GOD has wonderfully appeared and <hi>unveil'd</hi> himſelf for their <hi>Conſolation:</hi> and I never knew it <hi>fail,</hi> when Perſons after great <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> and having
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:005366_0092_101826631B2B3EF8"/>been long <hi>toſs'd</hi> up and down, as in a tempeſtuous <hi>Ocean,</hi> have been <hi>brought to this Temper;</hi> GOD has as it were ſhown himſelf in haſte to comfort them; and <hi>ran</hi> (as it were) to <hi>meet</hi> 'em, while they were yet a great Way <hi>off:</hi> CHRIST has been like the ſwift-footed <hi>Roe,</hi> or the <hi>young Hart on the Mountains of Spices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another <hi>Error</hi> in ſuch Perſons <hi>ſeeking GOD,</hi> is ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Diſcouragement. Before they ask</hi> they do as it were <hi>conclude</hi> they ſhall have a <hi>Denial;</hi> and <hi>while</hi> they are asking, they do as it were <hi>tell GOD</hi> that he <hi>won't an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer 'em;</hi> and ſo they greatly <hi>diſhonour</hi> him, deny him the <hi>Glory</hi> of his Grace, and provoke a Denial. They ask in a <hi>heartleſs</hi> Manner, becauſe in a <hi>diſcourag'd</hi> Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. Hence they have no <hi>Reſolution</hi> to ſay as <hi>Jacob</hi> did, "<hi>I will not let thee go, except thou bleſs me.</hi> When they <hi>ask</hi> and are <hi>denied,</hi> it has not that <hi>Effect</hi> upon them, as it had upon the <hi>Woman of Canaan,</hi> to make her <hi>cry the more earneſtly,</hi> and to be the more <hi>reſolute.</hi> On the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,</hi> they are <hi>knock'd on the Head,</hi> and are ready to conclude, that GOD <hi>don't intend</hi> to ſhow 'em Mercy, and that <hi>his Mercy is clean gone for evermore.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another <hi>Error</hi> in their ſeeking is, that they <hi>ſeek Comfort more than Holineſs.</hi> We ought to ſeek <hi>Comfort,</hi> and the Joy of the <hi>Light of GOD's Countenance,</hi> as of more <hi>Worth</hi> than all the World; but our Minds ſhould be more <hi>engaged,</hi> and our <hi>Strength</hi> more imploy'd, in an earneſt <hi>Care</hi> and Strife to do our <hi>Duty to</hi> GOD, and to <hi>ſerve</hi> him; than to <hi>attain</hi> the Comfort of <hi>Satisfaction a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout our own Condition:</hi> It ſhould be our <hi>Meat and Drink to do the Will of GOD:</hi> If we take effectual Care of <hi>this,</hi> GOD will take Care of our <hi>Comfort,</hi> and will do that for us, which <hi>we</hi> can never do for our Selves: He'll ſcatter our <hi>Clouds</hi> and Darkneſs, and fill our Souls with <hi>Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. Another <hi>Error</hi> in ſuch Perſons <hi>ſeeking GOD</hi> is, that they do not ſeek him in the Way of <hi>all Duty.</hi> It may be they abound in <hi>praying,</hi> and <hi>reading,</hi> and <hi>meditating,</hi> and <hi>faſting;</hi> and <hi>lie upon their Faces</hi> as <hi>Joſhua</hi> did, when <hi>ſmitten before A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>;</hi> but they are not ſo thorough in the
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:005366_0093_10182665286BC358"/>mean Time <hi>to ſearch out the Achan;</hi> the <hi>Treſpaſs</hi> in every Way of the <hi>Commandments</hi> of GOD. For GOD is to be ſought and <hi>waited on</hi> in the Way of the <hi>Practice</hi> of <hi>every Thing</hi> that he calls us to, whether they be the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi> of the <hi>firſt</hi> or <hi>ſecond Table:</hi> the immediate Duties of <hi>Religion,</hi> or of <hi>ſecular Buſineſs:</hi> Theſe are <hi>all</hi> of 'em <hi>Wiſdom's Gates</hi> and the <hi>Poſts of her Doors,</hi> where we are to <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>wait.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus Sir, I have briefly expreſs'd my <hi>Thoughts</hi> with Regard unto the <hi>Difficulties</hi> of that Nature which you labour under. <hi>Experience</hi> abundantly convinces me of my <hi>Inſufficiency</hi> to relieve in ſuch Caſes.
