            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WE live in a dying World. Our dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Friends and most precious Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ever and anon bidding us a sorrowful farewel. To sanctifie God in a duly moderated Mourning at such a time, is a great but difficult Duty. God is most dishonoured by our admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our passions to carry us beyond bounds; and a Christian never more needs relief, than on such occasions, when Nature influenced by cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption carries him into unbecoming transports of ungoverned Affections. God hath therefore, in his word, provided excellent Cordials to revive the Spirits of his Children, and keep them from fainting under these trials. One of them, and none of the least, is presented you in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Discourse. These Sermons were Preached in a time when Death rode in Triumph among us; when many were carried dayly <hi>to their long home, and Mourners went thick about our streets;</hi> and they were not, through Gods bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, without their desired effect. And since there will be frequent occasions for you to make use of this <hi>Receipt,</hi> as long as you converse with Mortality, it hath been desired to be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

            <p>MAN, who in his Creation was made of dissoluble Principles, is by his Apostasy subjected to that Dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, had he retained his Integrity, should never have actually siezed upon him: whereas now the whole race of fallen men are daily exposed to be made a prey to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Death, which comes armed against them in a thousand shapes; and without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour or respect to persons, snatcheth them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from among the living: sometimes it comes on foot, taking here one and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, in an easy progress; as in times of health and peace: other whiles it comes on. Horseback, <hi>Jehu</hi>-like, driving furiously, hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying men away by Shoals to the <hi>Land of Darkness:</hi> In which it dissolves the most sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ties, and makes a separation between the nearest Relations, which occasions Mankind's

being so often put into mourning. Now, as Nature prompts men to mourn over their Deceased Friends, and we may as well root out the Affections planted in Humanity, as to deny them the liberty of venting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves when there is an occasion offered; so the Christian Religion giveth us Rules for the due bounding, and right regulating of these passions, and it is a point of Christian Wisdom to be well instructed therein at all times, much more when the Providence of God orders it to be a time wherein the Sword abroad, and mortal sickness at home, are so often calling us to the exercise thereof: and he that is acquainted with the extravagant exorbitancy of his own Affections, will see a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant reason to take pains in learning of this Lesson. No man in his right mind can be so fond of sorrow, as not to be willing to have some lenitives applied to it, for the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the grief of it. <hi>Heathen Morality</hi> hath laid it self out very much upon this Subject; but alas! the best dose that ever that could provide for men, was nothing but a few <hi>Narcoticks,</hi> to stupify, and not in the least to cure that Malady. He that would be well provided for his relief in this case, must consult <hi>Paul</hi> and not <hi>Seneca</hi>; the Word of God, and not Pagan Philosophy, and here is one excellent <hi>Receipt</hi> prepared to our hand in the Text and Context.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:000583_0006_0FA712C8E94815B0"/>This <hi>Chapter</hi> belongs to the <hi>hortatory</hi> part of the Epistle; and from this <hi>verse</hi> to the end of the <hi>Chapter,</hi> he gives precious and profitable advice to the people of God about their <hi>mourning</hi> over their Deceased Friends: The advice it self is given in the <hi>Text,</hi> the arguments to strengthen it, and render it profitable to them, is in the following <hi>verses.</hi> The advice it self is, not to mourn despair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly over them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the reasons why they should not so do are three; taken from the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the glorious Resurrection they shall ere long arrive at, the happy meeting which they shall then have with the Lord Jesus Christ, and their being thenceforth made to live with him for ever in glory; and one would think this were enough to set men down compleatly satisfied, could they embrace all this with Faith.</p>
            <p>In the words then we may take notice of,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Subject to whom the advice is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Brethren</hi>; he applies it to such as were by profession Christians, and in the judgment of Charity, true believers. This Cordial is only provided for such, and if any other shall take it, it may prove to be poyson un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Subject concerning whom this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is given; <hi>Them which are asleep</hi>: sleeping is an expression which the Spirit of God makes frequent use of in the Scripture to express
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000583_0007_0FA712CB05EABD70"/>
dying by; and it is for the most part applied to the death of the Godly, thereby to take away the formidableness of it, and make it more welcome to us; he therefore intends such as are dead in Christ, or those whom we are well perswaded of, that they had a title to him by a living faith: such, of whose death we have encouragement to believe that it is but a sweet sleep.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The subject matter about which the advice is given, <hi>viz. Sorrow:</hi> It refers to the Affection of <hi>grief,</hi> which is apt to break forth into, and vent it self in bitter mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon such sad and solemn occasions as these.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The advice it self which he gives in this case, wherein he doth not forbid all sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but only regulates it. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> was no <hi>Stoick</hi>; the Spirit of God never advised men to <hi>Apathy</hi>: there is danger in <hi>despising</hi> as well as in <hi>fainting under</hi> affliction, and therefore they are both cautioned against <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.9 and there is a double limitation here set to it; or rather a limitation with an explication.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The limitation it self is, <hi>as do others: Gr. as the rest, or residue</hi>; i. e. of mankind: by these he intends such as are not Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, nor have been instructed in the Doctrines of the true Religion: and the comparison may be referred either to the <hi>Heathenish
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000583_0008_0FA712CCA9163BF8"/>
modes</hi> used by them in their mourning, or else to the <hi>degrees of sorrow</hi> which they were wont to express in it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other limitation or explication of the former, is, in these words; <hi>which have no Hope. Hope</hi> is an Affection very service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for the alleviating of sorrow, and where that is not active, g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ief will grow up to despair.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Here is also one general help offered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this irregular and unbounded mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz. Knowledge: I would not have you to be ignorant.</hi> Implying that it was Gentile ignorance, which made them so to mourn; the knowledge and the thorough perswasion of sound Principles will help to fortifie us against the imitation of them.</p>

The Apostle, applying of himself to his</hi> Thessaloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>makes a plain difference between them, and others who did not believe: he leaves wicked men to sorrow without hope if they will, yea and he reckons that they have reason enough so to do; but he wholly disallows it in the Children of God, as a thing that is altogether unreasonable, and that must be because they have something pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to support their spirits withal, or else what should make the difference? The world indeed make high pretences to their comforts, but they are of another stamp and character than those that belong to the people of God, and no way comparable with them: and we may observe these four differences between them.</hi>

There are some whom they do belong unto, but they are not all who may make this claim: there are terrors there also, which are the portion of many: and it is not a little perilous in this case, for men to arrogate to themselves that which is not their own: when God is about to speak comfort to his people, he then saith unto ungodly men, hands off; he would have them to stand by and hear, but not to presume: if their hearing of them pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon his people, may awaken them to see their own misery in being without them, and excite them to diligence in seeking after an interest in them according to the Gospel directions; this is proper, and will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable; but if they take them as spoken to

               <p>A bodily death is the common lot of all sorts of men, and Piety is no more a Bail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it than wealth or honour, or pleasures. Our Apostle doth not here go about to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage his <hi>Thessalonians</hi> by telling them that they shall not lose their godly friends by death, no, but he endeavours to give them relief against oppressing sorrow in case they do lose them, presuming it to be a thing which they are daily to expect. The truth
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000583_0016_0FA712D49C00F5E8"/>
of this, in <hi>Thesi,</hi> is confirmed unto us by daily observation, we see the best, the most holy, the most desirable to be going off the stage from time to time: all men may make that observation, <hi>Psal.</hi> 49.10. <hi>He sees that Wisemen dye</hi>: when therefore Christ promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth that some, <hi>viz.</hi> such as had believed on him, should never die, it is not meant of a bodily but of a spiritual Death. Nor do some extraordinary instances of those that were translated that they should not see Death, as <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> invalidate the the generl Truth of this assertion, being only special exceptions from the rule. But that which calls for our observation and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry here, is, why Gods Children who are united to Jesus Christ, whose sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and from whom the Curse is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, must yet die as well as other men, upon whom the curse of Death lies in its weight? and we may take a summary account of it in the following <hi>Conclusions.</hi> For although there is enough to stop our mouths, and silence our cavillings, to consider that Infinite Wisdom hath seen meet in soveraign pleasure so to determine it: yet this Wisdom hath its rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and if we know them not all, yet it hath told us sufficient not only to silence, but to satisfie us too: here then let us observe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Death at first came into the world as a curse of sin. It was not a condition of
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000583_0017_0FA712D51B4E3C00"/>
mans nature, (as some do falsly suppose, and frivolously plead) but a consequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great Transgression, and a moral ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. <hi>By one man sin came into the world, and death by sin.</hi> God had laid a restraint upon Mortality in mans Creation, but he took it off again upon mans Apostasy, and left him to be a prey in the hands of it. If mankind had never sinned, he had never died. It is therefore a <hi>curse</hi> in its first intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction into the world, being in it self an evil which mans nature is grievously averse unto, and being brought in as a penalty up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the creature, and therein a clear disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of Gods righteous Displeasure at man: the Apostle therefore makes that an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment undeniably to prove that <hi>Sin was in the world from Adam to Moses,</hi> because <hi>men died</hi> all that while, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the whole Curse of the first Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is taken off from a man in his Justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. It is of the very nature of this benefit, that it removeth the Curse from that person to whom it is applied. The nature or essence of the Curse consists in that sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Condemnation which is past upon the sinner: now in Justification that very sentence is taken off from the man, and there is no more of it lying out against him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is now no condemnation to them that are in Christ.</hi> The forgiveness of sins
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000583_0018_0FA712D6C8169268"/>
is contained in it, and where sin is forgiven, the punishment of it is removed; such there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are said <hi>to be past from death to life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Hence the believers Death is spoiled of it's <hi>sting.</hi> It ceaseth to be unto them a cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Death. God can suffer Death it self to continue, and yet take the malediction out of it: he doth so by all the other afflictions which befal his people in this life, in that he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth them all <hi>to work together for their good, Rom.</hi> 8.28. and he doth so by Death it self too, for what saith <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 1.21. <hi>to dy is gain.</hi> When the poyson is taken out of it, it becomes an innocent and a serviceable thing, as will be seen afterward: and thus it is to all Gods people, so that <hi>Paul</hi> could make that challenge in behalf of all the regenerate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.45. <hi>O Death where is thy sting</hi>? he doth not say where is Death? but where is its sting? and this is the very thing which makes a Child of God not to be afraid to dy.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Yet there are many reasons why God sees it convenient that believers should die, and some of them are these following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is fitting that they should tast something of the fruit of sin. Though this be not in the way of a curse, yet they must have some experiment of it in the way of Providence: The Apostle tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10 <hi>The b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dy is dead because of sin.</hi> One thing designed in this expression is, that because
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000583_0019_0FA712D72B06FBF0"/>
Gods people were once sinners, therefore God will have them to tast of a bodily death. This becomes to them a witness that once they were Transgressors, and serves to keep them humble under all the grace they have received, and the sense of Gods love in Christ, which they enjoy, to think that they still must die. It is true, if there were nothing else of advantage to them by dying but only this, God would not have thus continued it to them: but still, this is a Remembrancer to them as long as they live; and it is one profitable use of it to them, <hi>to bring sin to remembrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Death is sometimes a fatherly correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which God inflicts upon his Children. There must be acknowledged a vast difference between a curse and a chastisement: the matter of the one and the other may be the same, but the design which denominates them, is vastly divers. A <hi>curse</hi> is ever the fruit of hatred, but a <hi>correction</hi> hath always love in the bottom of it: there is indeed anger in it; and it consists well enough with the love of God, for him to be angry with his children, and when he is so, he can lay hard blows upon them, and love them still, because they are for their good and not hurt; yea, <hi>because he loves them he chastens them, Heb.</hi> 12:6. And sometimes he strikes so hard that he kills them. God is angry with <hi>Moses</hi> for his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000583_0020_0FA712D95D2C1BF0"/>
unadvised carriage at <hi>Meribah,</hi> and he must die for it: <hi>David</hi> provokes him in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Vriah,</hi> and he must lose his Child on the account: and though such a stroak hath a great deal of smart in it, yet there is no harm comes of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3 <hi>Gods people must die, that sin may be root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of them. Sin is beyond dispute the worst evil, and the greatest misery; that Gods people are for the present subjected in it, and have the remains of it in them, they wofully experience: and it is no little infelicity that abides them to consider that they will be sinning as long as they continue in this life: this makes them to cry out dolefully of their</hi> wretchedness; <hi>with him,</hi> Rom. 7.24. <hi>and it is Gods good pleasure not to destroy this sin all at once, nor totally as long as they live; but they must know it to be an</hi> evil and bitter thing <hi>by sad experience in themselves. But when they die, then they sin no more; that unhappy work is at an end with them for ever; so then, their death is to them a passage into a sin less estate: and henceforth God will be no more dishonoured nor their souls wounded by their sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. And they must die that their Grace may be perfected, and this is consequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the former: for till sin be totally abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n the man, his Grace must needs labour under imperfection. All the sanctification of a believer in this life is but <hi>in part,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of this, he practically comes short in
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000583_0021_0FA712DB9207A960"/>
every thing that he sets about: and it is no little trouble upon his spirits to find so much of the mixture of sinful defect in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing which he takes in hand: but now Death passeth him over to the fulness of a perfect man in Christ; the Souls that are gone through Death unto Glory, are called <hi>The Spirits of Just Men made perfect</hi>: Heb. 12.23. there are they arrived unto entire Holiness; and this also they get by Dying.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By Death Gods People are delivered from Satan and ungodly men, as long as they are here in this life, they dwell with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the reach of these enemies, and they give them no little molestation; partly by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, putting them to all the trouble they can; partly by Temptation, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to draw them aside into sin, that so they may wound their Souls; and partly by their ungodly lives, whereby they are to these a continual <hi>vexation,</hi> as the <hi>Sodomites</hi> were to <hi>Lot,</hi> whilst he dwelt among them; so that their life is a meer <hi>dwelling in Mesech, and sojourning in the Tents of Kedar</hi>: and these <hi>Daughters of Heth,</hi> makes them <hi>weary of their lives</hi>: but when they come to die they are then removed from them, and shall be molested with them no more for ever: they are now called away and carried to that
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000583_0022_0FA712DD91046E18"/>
place where no such creatures as these shall ever come.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Death puts an end to all the sorrows of Gods Children which they encounter withal here. This world is <hi>a vale of tears,</hi> sin hath made it to be so; and the Saints of God have a very large share in the troubles of this life; the <hi>few days</hi> which are allowed to them to live in, are <hi>full of trouble</hi>: and very often do they meet wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sed; but though it be for their benefit, it is yet troublesome, and will be an happiness to be rid of it, when we are fit for such a delivery: and this shall be when they dy; now shall all their <hi>tears be wiped away,</hi> and their cheeks shall be dried: their bodies will now <hi>rest</hi> in their <hi>graves,</hi> when sickness and pain shall hurt them no more: and their Souls are conducted into that place, where trouble is a perfect stranger, where grief and molestation were never known.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Death also finisheth all their labour. The work of a Christian is a great work<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and hard too; the remains of strong and active corruption in them, together with the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:000583_0023_0FA712DE02809448"/>
of every Grace they have, and the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position which they encounter both from without and within, makes it to be so: and though it be the delight of the new man to be engaged in Holines<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, yet the employment it self is work, and wrestling and fighting. Now, as God hath appointed this life to be unto his people a time of labour; so the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther life is for rest, and it is Death which wafteth them over into it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. <hi>They rest from their labour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. It removes them to the place of their compleat Happiness.

The Apostle saith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. <hi>if our hope in Christ were for this life only, we were of all men most miserable</hi>; and it must needs be so upon this article, that believers must die as well as others; for who meet with more of the troubles of this life than they do?

For,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Sleep is a binding up of the senses, and thereby it takes off the apprehension of pain and trouble. A man that is asleep doth not feel his sorrow. If it be Bodily pain, or if it be any grief oppressing the spirit, by fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asleep he loseth the present sense of it: as long as it keeps him waiting he is molest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with it, but now it is to him as if it were not; and Death puts a real end to all the molestations and sorrows of the people of God. In this life they are ful of them, and they accompany them to their dissolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but at the Grave they leave them, and they know them no more: <hi>All their Tears are now wiped away,</hi> sighing and sorrow now cease for ever.</p>

go to sleep they leave off labouring; it puts an end to present business; men lay aside their work, when they lay themselves down to rest: and the death of Gods Children gives a cessation unto their work: the time of life is working time for Gods People, and they have a great deal of business to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying themselves in, whilst they are here, in glorifying of God, and in working out of their own Salvation; this is enough to employ all their time, if they had a great deal more than they have; but when once they come to dy, they have done with this, there is no <hi>business</hi> to be done in <hi>the Grave, Eccl.</hi> 9 10. and this is one part of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of Believers in their Death, That <hi>they rest from their Labours, Rev.</hi> 14:13.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Labour to feel the weariness of this life. They are the <hi>weary,</hi> that would fain <hi>be at rest.</hi> As long as life and the concerns of it are not tiresome to us, so long we are loth to dy, and the thoughts of it are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to us; but when it is thus with us, then the very forethoughts of it will afford u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:000583_0034_0FA712EB754465F8"/>
putting us to continual grief: and there are the sins of others, which we must see and hear, which will wring tears from our eyes: there are also the sorrows which this life is burdened withal, and will not be at an end whilst that lasts: yea and the very difficulties with which a Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an doth any thing for God here, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his weak grace, and the strong corruption which makes resistance to it; yea, and the dismal days that are expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come: it is an happiness to be at rest out of the noise and bitterness of such things: that therefore was a merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful promise which was made to the godly King <hi>Josiah,</hi> 2 Chron. 3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. Be sure to get your work done. The child or servant who hath loitered all the day is loth to come home at night, because he can give so poor an account of his business: but he that hath followed his labour with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and improved his time carefully in the work he was set about, goes home to his rest with a great deal of chearfulness. There is nothing which makes a Child of God more unwilling to dy, than to look back and see how wofully he hath neglected the work of God which he was called unto, and how unhappily he hath been diverted from it; <hi>he is blessed whom his Lord finds so doing.</hi> To have our great Master come to us &amp; say, you

have laboured sufficiently for the day; come now and lay you down to your rest, is a most comfortable thing: <hi>be you faithful unto the death,</hi> and it shall be so.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Endeavour to get this assurance that your souls shall be safe lodged when you dy. This is the great concern of all men. The soul is every wise mans principal care, and when that is secured all is well: he that can say as <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <p n="1">1. What influence Hope hath upon sorrow for the moderating of it.</p>
               <p>A. It hath already been observed that sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row is an affection which sinks the Spirits under the pressure of a present evil that is felt: and hereupon the greater the evil <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> the more sinking it must needs be. The Spirits of men have some portion of strength in them, so that they are able to bear a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable burden, and to stand upright under it without sinking; but sometimes they meet with a burdrn which is too heavy, and then they stoop, &amp; are overwhelmed. Now though aff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="51" facs="unknown:000583_0054_0FA712FFAB067720"/>
&amp; that is a breaking b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

That therefore which will ease us in this circumstance, will grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Now this is the nature of Hope, that it is an affection in the exercise whereof we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain our minds with the grounded expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation of some future good. The <hi>object of hope is good</hi>; it is one of those affections which carries us after our object, and enables us to embrace it: <hi>it is derived from love</hi>; and the good which it doth embrace is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing <hi>future</hi>; it hath it not in hand or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent possession, the man need not hope for that which he hath; but he sees it at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; but yet Hope carries the Soul to the thing, as far off as it is, enableth him to entertain it; and for this reason the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Patriarchs are said to <hi>see the promise afar off,</hi> and yet to <hi>embrace it,</hi> Hebr. 11.13. and in this respect it makes absent things to be present.

of life and nourishment in it; Hope can quarter it self pretty comfortably upon this, though there is also a gradation in this, and the more likelihoods there are of the things <hi>obtaining</hi>; the better Table Hope <hi>is</hi> able to keep: and <hi>with these discoveries it is</hi> able to <hi>suppress those</hi> fears <hi>which</hi> may make any <hi>motion in him</hi> by reflecting upon the <hi>pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility</hi> that the <hi>thing</hi> may <hi>miscarry; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> if <hi>things</hi> be not near an <hi>equipoise,</hi> but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>thing bids fair</hi> for a good Issue <hi>likely</hi> to <hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Finally there is Certainty; and this is the top of all; when the thing is so secure, that there is no possibility of its failing, the futuriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it is built upon such grounds as cannot mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carry, or in the least be prevented; this furnisheth Hope with such a rich Table, that it is able to feast it every day, and make merry in spite of all that can interpose to disturb it; compare,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16. <hi>where the Apostle tells us how they bare up chearfully under afflictions, in hope of better things</hi>; with chap. 5.1. <hi>where he gives an account of the strength of this,</hi> for we know, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And now we may easily discover what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence this must have upon sorrow to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper it, and make it moderate, <hi>viz.</hi> by giving us a prospect of good with relation to that very evil which hath put us to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: and there are these effects which are
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:000583_0057_0FA71303C6E1C7A0"/>
the natural result of it, all of which are very serviceable unto this purpose.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It makes the affliction look less then it did before: it hath not so much in it now as appeared to us at the first aspect: for by this hope entertained, we begin to discern that it is not so great an evil as we had reckoned it to be: the man had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated it, whilst he was looking upon it thro' the spectacles of despair; but Hope puts a sweeter colour and countenance upon it; it makes him to resolve that it is nothing near so bad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s he had been perswaded by his misgiving thoughts: it takes off many of those evil circumstances which he thought it to be attended withal; and this greatly heightens it, and makes it be far more por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; thus the Psalmist eased himself when he found the burden ready to sink him with its weight, <hi>Psal.</hi> 43. ult. <hi>Why art thou cast down O my soul, hope thou in God,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It moderates the affection of fear which before did exceed. Fear in excess affords con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual nourishment unto sorrow; if this passion be but moderated, the other will be far better dealt with: moderate fear is an help to men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it puts caution into them, and employs them in a diligent using of means to redress their troubles; but if it grows beyond the bounds of moderation, it then drives men from endeavour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:000583_0058_0FA71305DD3E01F8"/>
and betrays them into the hands of despair, which is the bitterest ingredient of Sorrow: now Hope is a preventive to this; because, how sore soever the present distress be, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the man to expect a good issue of it, and to resolve with him,</hi> Psal. 56.3. what time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It diverts the mind with better thoughts, sorrow takes a great deal of pleasure in fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it self with poring upon black and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter speculations; it findeth a kind of a sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len contentment in representing every thing to it self with Sable Colours, and thereupon to sink it self yet lower with its own thought whereas Hope interposeth more bright and lightsome things for the mind to be looking upon, and by such an entertainment as this is, gives unto it a very happy diversion; the heart is hereby opened, and hath liberty gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it to fetch breath and recover spirits &amp; life again.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It puts men upon the exereise of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience. Impatience under sorrow, makes it to be a great deal more burdensom than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise it would be: now the genuine fruit of Hope is patience: when expectation is raised in a man, it puts him upon waiting, and makes him quiet in waiting; and this is proportionable to the degrees that hope hath arrived to; so that when the good ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected is certain to come without fail, and
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:000583_0059_0FA71307444EEF90"/>
there is a clear prospect that when it doth come, it will make a full compensation for all the trouble which hath been susteined, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the removal of it from him; a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable perswasion that it shall be so, makes him to be earnestly looking out for it, and to satisfy himself for the present with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of it. This may suffice for the consideration of Hope in general; it follows to enquire.</p>
               <p n="2">2: What ground of Hope the people of God have, concerning their Dead, more then other men have.</p>
               <p>A. The Apostle here intimates concerning others, that they have none at all: not as if there were none but Gods children that make any pretence to an hope concerning such as these. If we speak of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Nations, to which our Text hath a more immediate respect, they enterteined divers sentiments concerning the state of the dead, and made answerable improvement of these notions. The <hi>Epicurean</hi> Sect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed thought man to be utterly mortal; their tenent was <hi>Cum sumus, non est mors; cum mors est, non sumus.</hi> And hereupon they pleased themselves with this, that death puts an end to all miseries: But the <hi>Platonists</hi> held the Immortality of the soul, and the communion of souls in a future state, and would take a great deal of satisfaction in
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:000583_0060_0FA71307EC5C2BB0"/>
the forethoughts of that happy day when they should come to enjoy one another again in a better condition. The <hi>Peripateticks</hi> also verged this way, though not without some hesitancy. But as to the Resurrection of the Body, it agreed not with their principles, and seemed an impossibility to their way of reasoning, and therefore they exploded it with all manner of scoffs and scorns: If we speak of the visible profession of Christiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and such as have been acquainted with the Word of God, these do for the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity acknowledge the same Truths upon which the Hope of Gods Children is built<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and do also support themselves with such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ope from the consideration thereof, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords them a great deal of present quiet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the intendment of the expression is, that there are none else but the people of God who have a good ground for their Hope; that all others, how confident soever they may be, do build without a foundation.</p>
               <p>Now if we would take a right scantling of this matter, there are three things which must be considered in conjunction?</p>
               <p n="1">1. The persons hoping; and they are such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> this hope is offered to all persons where the Gospel comes, yet there are none that have really embraced it but they, and though
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:000583_0061_0FA71308D7210158"/>
the goodness of the person hoping, doth not contribute any thing to the good estate of the person for whom this hope is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, (for every one must be saved by his own faith, and not that of another, which is of Gods free-giving, and not o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> our meriting,) yet there is an hope which godly men may entertain with respect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their dead, which others cannot do upon the same reason: yea and there are argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of comfort to be drawn from their hope, by such as these, which others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not derive unto themselves without false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; as will be made to appear in the sequel of this discourse.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The persons hoped for: they are such <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </hi> sleep: i. e. <hi>such as we have any grounded hope concerning, that they</hi> died in Christ; <hi>and this is not the lot of all men; nor yet of all such as live under the Dispensation of Gospel Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and have been externally related to the Covenant: and it is a thing very evident that the hope here intended hath all its strength from Christ; and therefore the thing hoped must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from an interest in him, and by consequence it must hold proportion with the reason which we had to conclude that they had such an interest, for, to be</hi> without Christ, <hi>and to be</hi> without hope, <hi>do run parallel, Eph.</hi> 2.12.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The things upon which our Hope feeds it self concerning them, and from which it sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies

us with our consolation: and they must be such things as are in themselves hopeable, and upon a presumption that they shall come to pass, do contain matter of good consolation in them. Now that which must comfort us in our mourning for those that are dead, must give us particular relief against those very things which are the grounds of our Sorrow: and the proper reason of this sorrow is, a supposed loss which there is sustained by their death: and this must be either</hi> with <hi>respect to our selves, or unto them</hi>: That which is with respect unto our selves is, that we have lost them, and that which refers unto them is that they are lost: here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the evil which we apprehended to be suffered by this loss, is that by which we take the measure of our sorrows: all the hope then which we can entertain about it, either that the thing is not so as we think, or that it is not so bad as we did suspect it to be, will give us mitigation here: and that is it which we are to make enquiry af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Let us then for the present take it for granted upon supposition, that we that are Mourners are true believers; and they for whom we are in mourning, are such as are <hi>dead</hi> in Christ: and in this case, the Word of God is fully stored with abundant provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to establish our Hope, against those very things which Christians are wont to make the greatest arguments of their grief.</p>

<pb n="67" facs="unknown:000583_0070_0FA713ECAB63B250"/>
full, and there is nothing wanting in them; and they are also certain with respect to all those that are so qualified, as we have been considering; we have the infallible Testimony of the Spirit of God recorded in the Holy Scriptures giving us a full confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of these things.</p>
               <p>But there is a great enquiry whieh still remains, and it is about the strength of this hope in reference to the Subject about which it is to be conceived by us: Though the things themselves be indubitable conclusions concerning all such as are so qualified; yet what room is there to exercise this hope in particular, respecting this and that person? and how may our sorrow be mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated thereby? for, suppose we our selves are true believers, and consequently heirs of the Promise, yet except we have some encouragement to hope and believe that those who are gone, <hi>died in Christ,</hi> we must remain hopeless concerning them. <hi>I</hi> know that there are divers serious Souls, that would desirously have something be offered for their satisfaction in this great case; I shall therefore endeavour to discuss it according to Scripture Light; and to make way for a more full resolution, let these things be premised.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Christian Hope is a Grace which is exercised by the influence of Faith. Faith
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000583_0071_0FA713ED73F529A8"/>
is the leading Grace of all those that are wrought in Sanctification, and a Child of God lives by it, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 10.38. <hi>the Just shall live by his Faith i. e.</hi> it is to influence the hope of a Christians conversation: it is that whereby he depends upon Christ, and by the promise, derives from him all that which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nableth him to serve God in the improvement of every vertue that is in him: and this is that which principally makes Christianity to differ from meer morality: Hope must have its grounds, and Gods people must have the help of Faith to establish them on these grounds.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Hence we infer, that a Believers hope hath a good foundation to build upon, which it is fully assured of. For if it be built upon Faith, it hath the same foundation in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom with Faith, and that must needs have its Evidence in it, which supposeth assurance: for that cannot be called Evidence or Demonstrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which is no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

we have not a like evidence of the being of the thing in those whom we hope for, which is the reason of our Hope; for,</p>

The dif<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ferencing notes by which Sincerity and Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisy are to be distinguished are latent; God only knows them certainly. A man may make a great shew, and carry it with a great deal of strict preciseness, and yet be rotten within. There are a great many that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and walk orderly for along time, and yet they fall at last into some soul Apostasy; and it is not to be questioned but that there are others that never discover themselves to the world, but go off fairly to our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, who yet dissembled, and deceived o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and it may be themselves too. The day will discover many mistakes and wrong guesses that were here made by the most discerning Christians. It is Gods alone prerogative to judge the heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>There are greater hopes concerning some than others, of some there are such probabilities as give us a great deal of settled satisfaction concerning them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> their lives are so holy, their

Testimonies are so clear, their conversation so shining, that we hope without any doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, having as much to set us down; as can rationally be expected for our satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their good state, others give only slight and more weak encouragements to our hope, and mix it with many occasions of fear and jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie concerning them: and yet hope hath at least so much to say, that there is some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, at least a possibility that they may be well, and this gives some relief, though not so much as the other.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This Hope is only given us for our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent support in this life. The truth is there will be no occasion for it afterwards: The Children of God are while they live here very anxious and sollicicions about the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting estate of their friends and relations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they know a great deal more then others do, concerning the terrors of the Lord, and the affairs of another world, and their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection put them upon much inquisitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness about them; the present thoughts which they have of their being under the impression of those doleful miseries that are denounced in the curse, are killing thoughts, and they cannot tell how to support their spirits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them, but they are ready to sink, God is therefore pleased to afford them this Hope for their present relief. When a Child of God is made perfect, as he shall then
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000583_0076_0FA713F38E666E90"/>
be fully informed and assured about these things, so he shall be compleatly satisfied in them; there shall be no unruly unmortified affections then to be wrested withal, but an entire acquiescence in the Justice and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of God: and as there will be no more room for hope, either for one or for another, because every ones state shall be put beyond it, so there will be no occasion for it: but whilst we are here in this life, there is no doing without it, God hath therefore set it before us, together with the grounds of it, and they that make a right improvement, shall never be ashamed of it: the use of our hope, is not to do them any good, for they are gotten past the advantage of receiving any benefit by us; but it is to do our selves good, and it serves suitably to that end, when it is helpful to put us into a quiet and submissive frame to the hand of God upon us.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>We are to rest in the revealed will of God for our Hope, and not to pry into his secret will. It is to be granted, that concerning our selves, we may come to know our Election by our vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and we ought to endeavour to arrive to that assurance</hi>; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. <hi>but we can have no such knowledge concerning others. We are apt to say, oh! if we were but sure of their well-being, we could then be quiet and contented; but this is to fight against God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it is his pleasure
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:000583_0077_0FA713F601840020"/>

                     </gap>th the particular estate of these and those in another life; when we are, we shall know; and that will be when there are no more remainders of flesh and corruption in us. In the</hi> Interim, <hi>God hath so far reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mind unto us in his word, as to give us those grounds of hope, in which we ought to bear up, and comfort, at least sustain our souls: but we must ever remember that of,</hi> Deut. 29.29. the secret things belong to God. <hi>It is Gods will that we should pry no farther, than into his word, for our direction; and it is our duty to comply with his will, and there can be no profit in doing otherwise.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="7">7. All the Arguments of our Hope, are to be fetched f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. The unhappy fall hath brought the whole race of mankind under the sentence of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation: man, woman, and child are so many dead persons according to the tenour of that Covenant: the curse of Death is fallen upon them, which hath bound them over to the suffering of all misery. It is in the new Gospel Covenant that <hi>life and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:000583_0078_0FA713F7562E0250"/>
are brought to light</hi>; and as the only way to Salvation is there made known to us, so the foundation upon which Salvation is to be hoped for, is there alone to be found &amp; it is according thereunto that we have solid encouragement.</p>
               <p>From hence therefore I shall endeavour to draw those Rules upon which our hope is to Proceed in the Present case. And here also there are two sorts about whom we are wont to be concerned and very thoughtful, <hi>viz.</hi> such as dy in their infancy, and such as dye adult, or after they are come to years of understanding: <hi>I</hi> shall speak of each distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Concerning Children that dye in their infancy. <hi>I</hi> understand all that age wherein they are not grown up to these years of knowledge, wherein they are able to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the word of God, and the ordinances of the Gospel, for the good of their own Souls, in the ordinary course of Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; for some extraordiaary instances are not here to be drawn into a general Rule. There is great reason why we should not mourn for these as that have no <hi>Hope</hi>; for there is a great deal to be pleaded, and that which is abundantly satisfying, upon their score. And we may take a brief discovery of it in these particulars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Negatively take these three Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ons.</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <pb n="76" facs="unknown:000583_0079_0FA713F7EFBF3C70"/>1. That Saving Grace is not absolutely tied to the visible covenant. It doth not ascertain Conversion and Salvation to every one that is under it. The Gospel Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant requires such conditions to be found in us, as God alone is able to work by Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty power, and he is Soveraign in his dispensations; <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, Rom.</hi> 9.8. His Grace is free. So that being in the Covenant and under the terms of it, doth it not make an infallible truth that such an one must &amp; shall be Saved. We know that God hath a Glory for his revenging <hi>Justice,</hi> as well for his Grace, to be gained in his visible Church; there are therefore threatnings as well as promises put into the Covenant; and the promises themselves are Conditional, and will argue no farther than from the Condition being wrought in the person, which God is not under any possitive engagement to this or that person to do it for him:</p>
               <p n="2">2. The innocency of Children cannot save them. Nor is it any reason or ground of Salvation: It is not that which makes any impression, or becomes any motive on the heart of God to save them rather than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. It is then a very poor Hope that is built upon this Consideration. This, as it raiseth prejudices in some at the providence
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:000583_0080_0FA713F8ACFB4628"/>
of God to think that such poor innocents must dy, and they are ready to murmure on this account; so it is the strength <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>f the Hope of a great many other; they comfort themselves after such a manner, poor Babes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they never did any harm in this world, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent Lambs that never sinned in their lives, surely then God cannot but pity and have mercy upon them, and is this all? alas! there is no reason nor plea at all in this. <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>.</hi> By innocence we can intend truly no more but only this, <hi>viz.</hi> that they never actually did any harm, that they have not committed any actual sin since they were born; and this is a very poor sort of innocence: why did they not so do? it was because they could not; they were not arrived to a capacity of doing either good or hurt: as not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the liberty or power of using their ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional faculties for the performing of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane acts: but in the mean while let us re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, they were only <hi>innocent vipers,</hi> that were as full of the poyson and malignity of sin as ever they could hold, and would have vented this venome of theirs as soon as they had gotten a little strength and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; we should soon have seen what brood they were of; and therefore in themselves
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:000583_0081_0FA713F985BA8998"/>
deserved to be killed in the nest; we are told what all <hi>Adams</hi> posterity are, in their birth, Psal. 58.3. <hi>they are estranged from the womb, they go astray as soon as they are bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. Nor can the piety of the parents merit the application of saving grace to the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. God is not obliged or brought in debt unto us, by any thing of ours. We ourselves when we have done all we can, and served God with the greatest integrity, are still <hi>saved by grace, Eph.</hi> 2.8. And so must our Children too: God hath the liberty to do with his own what he will, we cannot be before hand with him. They greatly err, who think that infants are saved by the Faith of their Parents, as the Condition of their salvation; much less can it be the procuring cause of it: The qualification to which Salvation is ascerteined, or the condition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the new covenant in order to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation must be found. Habitually at least, in every one that partakes in the good of it; <hi>The Just shall live by his Faith</hi>; and as a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Parent can neither Propagate it by Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, nor produce it by all his most careful endeavours, so neither can he make God a Debtor of it to his Children by any thing that he can do, for <hi>when he hath done all he is
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:000583_0082_0FA713FA333B20A8"/>
an unprofitable Servant, hath done but his duty, Luk.</hi> 17.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Positively, take these following conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;</p>
               <p n="1">1. That godly parents have a better hope concerning their Children than those that are Unconverted. Though both are in the Gospel Covenant outwardly, and under the external dispensations of it: and though a gracious man can no more merit for his Children then an ungracious man; nor can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of God, either such a Doctrine delivered, or such an example recorded, that any one such did miscarry. That <hi>David</hi> had any particular revelation extraordinary we read not, (and we may well enough, according to the tenour of Faith suppose that he had not) about that Child of his, and yet, tho' it were begotten in Adultery, and he had followed that with Murder, and other grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious sins; upon his true repentance, and his fasting and praying in particular for that Child, he is enabled to Comfort himself with this Hope, 2. <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.23. <hi>I shall go to him, but he shall not return to me.</hi> For it would be a poor argument of comfort we must think him to draw, if we suppose he argued only from a consideration of his own Death; nor could he expect or desire to go to him, but upon the Hope that he was gone to Glory.</p>

We are fully assured that there are multitudes of such as these are now in the kingdome: The word of God is very clear and plain for this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It was the argument which our Saviour Christ used to encourage their bringing of little children to him, when his Disciples would have prohibited them, <hi>math.</hi> 19.13.14. <hi>of such is the kingdom of Heaven</hi>; which text of Scripture assures us both that Jesus Christ hath a special favour for children, and that they are the Subjects

of his Grace and Glory; By the word [Such] cannot be meant such in quality, or dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as some would go about to put us off, for why did Christ take these little Children into his arms, &amp; Bless them? they whom he Blesseth are Blessed indeed: the meaning therefore plainly is, of such as dy in that age, that are taken away in their infancy: and there is a great deal of reason to draw this inference from it, that there are more of that than of any other Age, in Heaven.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="unknown:000583_0093_0FA71406F5C2D528"/>
that we feel for the loss of them: and here I shall first give some general Rules, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards apply them to the particular respects<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In general then.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Covenant promise is made to man upon Condition. It hath been already observed: that it is the New-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which gives men all their hopes: from thence they do derive; Now that as well as the O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d-one, is a conditional Covenant. The Promise, according as it is revealed in the Gospel, is not absolute, it is not there decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be made to these and those men par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and personally, but it is offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all where the Gospel comes, upon terms which are proposed for their acceptance: and indeed it could not be a Covenant Promise if it did not bear such a tenour: for it is Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to a Covenant that it always hath in it a mutual stipulation. Gods Decrees are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute but his Covenant, in which he transacts with the Children of men, is exhibited with Articles in it, which are proposed, in which God requires of men that they should thus do and makes a promise of Salvation to them upon their complyance w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th him; thus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were the Apostles commanded to Preach the Gospel, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16.15 16. And thus <hi>Paul</hi> proposeth it <hi>in Rom.</hi> 8.13. The Precept therefore and the promise connected together exhibit the Covenant.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="91" facs="unknown:000583_0094_0FA71407BA53A400"/>2. That except this Condition be wrought in them, they cannot be saved. That with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it they cannot lay any claim unto salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and there is neither injury nor false dealing in God, if he with-hold it from them: this is very evident, because the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel promise which is declared unto men, hath brought him no farther under obligation unto them, than according to the terms of it. If he should deny Salvation unto him that doth believe, he would not be so good as his word, because he hath ingaged it to all such, and made it their encouragment to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Joh. 3.16. <hi>that whosoever believes in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life</hi>: but if he with-hold it from an unbeliever, he is just, because he hath not performed the condition upon which it was tendered to him. But besides this, there is no hope that he ever will save such an one; nay he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bestow salvation upon any without the condition wrought in them: no unbeliever can be saved in his unbelief, because God should be equally false to his Creature in sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving such an one, as in denying Salvation to the other; in as much as there is a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant threatning which includes this man in it, and hath something to say to him which must be accomplished upon him, and that is, <hi>he must be damned, Mark</hi> 16.16. there is no room therefore for any indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:000583_0095_0FA714087279A568"/>
to such an one, nor will Gods Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness or Truth allow of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This also must be before they dy. The working of the Gospel condition in us, depends upon the Grace of God, and except he puts it in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to us we shall never have it: and he gives to none but here in this life,</hi> this is the only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted time, and day of salvation; <hi>there is no business to be done in the grave, and nothing of this nature left to be accomplished in another world: now only is working time, then every one comes to have his reward, and that is to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stributed to every one</hi> according to the things done in the flesh, 2 Cor. 1.10. <hi>Death dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poseth of men to their everlasting Vnchangeable Estate. It puts an end to the Gospel treaty, and brings every man to, and lodgeth him in</hi> that place from whence he shall return no more·</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>The reality of this work is a secret which no other can infallibly discern: The Saving change in a man is somthing inward: the sincerity of it lies in the heart; and that must be much out of our knowledge; It is Gods alone preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to</hi> Search <hi>and</hi> judge <hi>of that. All that l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ves within our compass to do about <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, is at most but conjectural, and the best conclusion that we can draw, is no more than that it is strongly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>obable that it m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y be so: though saving grace hath its marks or characters, yet because they are spiritual, there is none that can certainly know them, but he that gives them, and he
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:000583_0096_0FA714092E2E6EF8"/>
that</hi> hath received them: But as to what is visible to us. Grace hath its counterfeit; and there are those that can ape it so handsomly, that a discerning Christian, with all his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation cannot see into the imposture: &amp; by reason of this, there is many a false Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite that passeth with him for a sincere Christian, and many an upright soul, because of his great infirmities is suspected by him, he doubts of him whether he be right or no.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Yet there are the fruits of this change which are brought forth by such as live after their Conversion. They can bring forth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing before, for where there is no grace, there can be no exercise of it; and if they dy immediately upon it, as it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed that some do, they are deprived of the opportunity to discover it in an holy life, and God will accept of the will, and not deny his own Grace which he hath cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in them by his Almighty power; but if they are spared, and have a season allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them, they will more or less discover some encouraging symptoms of a work of God wrought in their hearts, by a life and conversation ordered according to the will of God, therein <hi>shewing forth the vertues of him that hath called them.</hi> They are regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to this end; and the Spirit of God will aid them in it; and so far as we disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver any of these things, our hope will receive
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:000583_0097_0FA71409EFE27028"/>

though that may be where there is no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace, yet many times it is a fruit of such an inward principle: Besides, there is corruptton in the best, and that many times hath not only a great influence into but also much of Prevalency upon the natural temper or constitution which is in men. There are some constitutions in men, which will make a great deal of shew with a little Grace and there are others that can make but a very small appearance of a great deal: and if we give to men these allowances, which Christian Charity requires from one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, we may lawfully Hope, that there might be the root of the matter in them, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they did not make so great a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it as could have been desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>

Some there be whose conversation is good and commendable, and their profession is very desireable: only they stand off from holding Communion with the Church of Christ at the Lords Table: and under this circumstance they live and dy: and there are too many who so do, and this consideration becomes a stumbling block, and occasion of many heart searchings in their friends when they come to dy in this Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and truly it is not without a great deal of reason: for out of doubt it is a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on all adult persons living under

If he be not sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for it, <hi>the sin lies at his own door,</hi> if he be and doth not come, how can he answer it? and therefore it must needs bring a cloud upon all his other profession, which will much darken it: and for a person to live and dy under the neglect of a known duty, and that of so great importance as this is, which Christ hath required every one that hath the least love for him, to attend upon <hi>in remembrance of him,</hi> hath not a little of reflection in it: many therefore, when they come to lie upon a Death-bed, have terrible agonies in their thoughts about it, and make little complaints against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves upon the account, promising that if ever God gives them a further opportunity they will reform it: and if persons do live without this Communion contentedly, and carelesly, it speaks as much against them, as all their other Religious Conversation can speak for them. But still there may be that which will give encouragement to our Hope
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:000583_0105_0FA711EEB7CD2800"/>
concerning such as do dy in such a condition as this.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If their abstinence from this Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion be not from contempt of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, but a jealousie which they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning themselves, There are those that have upon them a deep sense that they want the benefit of this Ordinance, and that Jesus Christ hath made it their duty to seek after it; but they are possessed with a great deal of fear, they apprehend in themselves a great deal of unworthiness: and unfitness for such a thing as this; and they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that if they should come they should abuse it, and thereby eat and drink their <hi>own Damnation:</hi> the danger of that afrights them, and they cannot tell how to get over it. Though this be sinful, yet it may be allowed by us to their infirmity, and that which they are striving against: yea it argues positively thus much, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is something of seriousness in these persons; and if God please to take them away before they can obtain to have their minds cleared and satisfied in this point, he knows how to pardon this infirmity to them.</p>

may carry in them. There are some which men cannot comply with, unless they will sin against the precept directly: and there are others which men can see no warrant for their being required of them, nor can they find a willingness in their own minds to do such things as Jesus Christ hath no where made their Duty; and this keeps them off. For the former, their abstinence is their commendation, and that man who can live without the Sacrament, rather than defile his conscience for enjoyment of it, commends his sincerity to the Consciences of others. For the latter, I would say: though <hi>I</hi> verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the terms of Communion are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="3">3. They have given Testimony on their Death-bed of their sincere Repentance of such neglects, and sought to God for his forgiveness of them through Christ, herein they have manifested to us that they have tasted the bitterness of such a sin, and God knows how to pardon them, and we may Hope that he hath remitted it to them, and accepted of them in his rich grace.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There are some that dy with a great deal of Comfort, &amp; professed Hope, &amp; possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly assurance of their good estate, and joyful expectation of the Glory to be revealed in them. They are both ready and willing to dy, and speak very comfortably concerning their after estate in another world; and this gives abundance of encouragement and comfort to their friends, and they are often ready to solace themselves in it. But the ground of this Hope is warily to be conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. It is indeed a very desireable thing in it self, to stand by and hear our dying Friend testifying of a good hope, for a blessed eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.

                  </gap> this is not without reason: they cannot be so prevailing because we had not the opportunity to see the trial of the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of this repentance of theirs. The terrours of Death, and the apprehensions of eternity just now to be entred into, and the consideration of the dreadful miseries of ungodly men, may well put men into ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible agonies, and bring their sins to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and make them to vomit up their morsels which before lay indigested upon their Consciences, drive them to making Confessions, to begging of pardon, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

fallen into some violent sickness, which hath at once bereaved them of the use of their understanding, and they have died distracted without any the least capacity ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of receiving counsel, or of giving glory to God by a free and humble confession of their sins: or, with <hi>Nabal,</hi> they have <hi>lain like a stone,</hi> and had no sense at all of any spiritual thing upon them.

               <p>Concerning such as these it must needs be confessed, that their fears are very great and amazing, and their hopes can be but very small: but yet give me leave to offer these rules to be considered.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the duty of all such silently and submissively to adore the Divine Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty, God is free in the dispensing of his grace, and <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy</hi>; and it is too much boldness for the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men to call him to give <hi>an account of any of these matters.</hi> It is recorded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Aaron,</hi> that when his two elder Sons were slain <hi>by a fire from Heaven,</hi> in the very act of <hi>offering strange fire unto God, that he hold his peace, Lev.</hi> 10 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and of <hi>Eli,</hi> that when the most dismal threatning of the fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful destruction of his two wicked Sons was delivered unto him, he said, <hi>It is the Lord,

               <p n="2">2. Not only is Gods absolute Supremacy, but his Righteousness to be acknowledged by us in such a case. Though the thing be terrible, yet he hath done nothing but what is just and equal in what he hath done; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what we had reason to live in continual expectation of: he hath warned us of, and threatned such things as these, that such as go on boldly in their trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions and will not be reclaimed, shall pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, and that quickly too; <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. <hi>He that being often reproved, hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy</hi>; he hath declared that <hi>strange Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> do wait for, and shall fall upon such refractory ones as these: and they that will live wickedly under all the means of grace, and strivings of Gods Spirit with them from time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This should humble us low before God, and put us upon the renewing of our Repentance, and peace with him; and by thus doing we shall have hope concerning our selves, that such an aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence as this is, shall <hi>work for our good</hi>; and so it shall <hi>turn also to our account,</hi> and make us the more careful to our selves, and over others, who are yet within the reach of our using the means with and for the bringing of them to obtain salvation.</p>

Their lamentations are excessive, they out do in quantity: they can set no bounds to their sorrow, but suffer themselves to be quite over-whelmed; their grief drinks up their Spirits: leaves them no room or liberty to take any comfort in any of the other many mercies and blessings of God which are yet continued to them, or gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to him the due acknowledgement of them, but, as if their comforts were all gone at one stroak, they cast themselves into the current, and suffer themselves to be carried away in the stream of sorrow: and there is not one word to be thrust in or spoken to them which they will hear, they cannot bear to be told of any thing that might relieve them in the least, or convince them of their Duty of patient and submissive bearing the hand of God that is upon them; the very mention of such a thing puts them into the most violent transports of an ungoverned passion.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Mourn too long. If it were only for the present, whilst their spirits are under a sudden surprize, and by reason thereof their sorrows are too hard for them, having got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten an advantage over them; although this

is not to be Justified, yet it might better be allowed; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t when they settle themselves to it, and resolve to bid adieu to all joys any more; they go mourning from day to day, and year to year, and never strive to get themselves into any composed frame, and their minds stayed: this is altogether a fault to be reprehended, it calls for a sharp rebuke; this is at least Heathenish, if it be not a great deal worse.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Their mourning puts them by their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they ow the constant performance of unto God. Any thing that obstructs a Christian Conversation, and takes men off from the service of God is to be reproved, and there are the Duties which we are called to a constant upholding of, and in so doing we express our faithfulness to God. The sorrow which drives us to more care and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence in these than before we used, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable for us; but that which puts us off from them, and so gives a check to our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress in holiness, is to be reprehended. All Christians are by Duty called to be spiritual <hi>Priests unto God,</hi> i. e. they are to offer up Sacrifices of Thanksgiving unto him in an holy life: now the <hi>Priest</hi> of old, was not <hi>to lay off his garments for mourning,</hi> i. e. he was not to unfit himself for the service of the Altar. If Gods Children do by their sorrow put themselves out of any disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:000583_0126_0FA712054A90ECF0"/>
for the duties incumbent on them, they do amiss; and that this reproof may take effect upon us, let us consider;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By thus doing you bring reproach up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christianity. Every Christian ought to be concerned more for the honour of God, and credit of his Religion, then for any thing that respects himself. If it were a truth, that you should gratifie your selves by comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with your own inclinations in so doing, yet if in the mean while you di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="2">2. By this you put away those comforts from you, which God hath provided for, or at least makes the offer of unto you, what are those Gospel discoveries made for, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God doth so abundantly acquaint us with the happiness of his People after Death; those precious entertainments which they find with him, that glorious Heaven which

he hath prepared for them, those Eternal Joyes which they shall swim in in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, that precious company, and those per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly happifying fruitions which they are there advanced unto, but only to give us an occasion thereby to comfort our selves in consideration of those that are gone to that place?

<pb n="125" facs="unknown:000583_0128_0FA71206AD0B43E8"/>
will be sure to cost us sorrow in the sequel. Let Gods Children then be humbled for, and beware of indulging themselves in such things.</p>

                  <p>Let it now be for a word of Exhortation to all that hear this Truth, that we labour to get, strengthen, and improve this Hope. Hath God graciously provided such an Hope for his people? let us then make it our own, and when we have gotten it, let us nourish it, and be in a readiness to make use of it at all times when Gods Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence calls us to have the occasion to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. You cannot well live without it in this world of change; and it will be very uncomfortable Travelling through this Wilderness without such a cordial to refresh your tired Spirits; for you must expect to meet with such occasions of sorrow as well as other men. Gods people are not to promise themselves <hi>a discharge from this War</hi> any more than other men: if they should be so foolish as to feed themselves up with an expectation of it, their experience would in a little time confute these expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Good men lose their Friends as well as bad; <hi>we see that wise men dy, as well as the foolish and bruitish, Psal.</hi> 49.11. and the more of these comforts that you do enjoy in this life, the more such bereavements you must expect to undergo: every one of them is mortal, and exposed to the common ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sualties by wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Death hath as many ways to seiz them as it hath for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and though godly men have more reason to hope for the sparing of the lives of theirs in a time of great Mortality by the judgments of God upon a sinning people, than the wicked and ungodly have; yet it must be acknowledged that in these things God doth his pleasure, <hi>That his Judgments are unsearchable, and his ways past our finding out.</hi>

Temptations on that account: now we shall be ready to be full of thoughts about them, and our selves, and about God too, and that will hurry us, and put us out of hope, if we be not the more careful to our selves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Hence your Affections will now have spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial need for something to moderate them. When such Providences have set them on working, and given vent to them, yea opened a great Flood-gate for them to run out at, you will now be sure to find great occasion for something to give check to the exorbitancy of them; they will else be very unruly, and bear down your Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and Religion too before them, so as to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate you into strange exorbitancies. Now there is nothing more proper or suitable for this purpose, than to have this hope by you, ready to clap in and stop the breach: if any thing will do, this will. If yoa can swim ashoar upon this plank, you will not need to fear drowning in the torrent of sorrow: the People of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made use of this really, but they found it profitable for their help at such a time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>It is not the portion of all that live un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Gospel to enjoy this Hope. There are indeed the offers of it made to all that sit under the Ordinances, and a way is pointed out unto them how they might come by it, but it is not every one that hath obtained a title to it so as to
<pb facs="unknown:000583_0131_0FA7120BCC2A3648"/>
be owner of it. It hath been before shewn, that it is the portion of none but such as have tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed in Christ, but</hi> all men have not faith; <hi>no not all that are visible believers, they have not that faith which is here requisite: It is proper to Gods Elect; it belongs to Gods Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> but all are not Israel that are of Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el: <hi>and it is a foolish thing to presume of it, except you have made it yours by coming under the Covenant promise: and it will be a woful unhappiness now to arrogate it, and when you come to have urgent occasion to make use of it, then to find that it doth not belong to you.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The exercise of this Hope will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry comfortable and profitable to you in such an hour. It will greatly heighten your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits when they are ready to sink under the weight of sorrow; it will revive you when you are almost fainting with Grief; it will give the Soul a standing, and enable it to feel the ground when it is in the Flood; <hi>we live by Hope, Rom.</hi> 8.24. It was <hi>Davids</hi> Catholicon against all despondencies, as we find, in <hi>Psal.</hi> 42, 43. this will be to us, light in darkness, joy in sorrow, comfort in heaviness, yea life in death it self: it will help you over the dashing billows which threaten to drown you, and afford you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newals of strength to enable you to hold on your course, and chearfully to travel thro' all the vicissitudes of time: by this you shall live comfortably in the midst of all these Storms, which will sink them that want it.</p>
                  <p>For Direction.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Make sure of your own good estate.
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:000583_0133_0FA712105FA90E88"/>
There is no man can challenge the Gospel Consolations to himself, any farther than he hath this perswasion, that he is entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the New Covenant: he that will take the promise as belonging to him, and not arrogate what is not his own, must see that the condition be wrought in him: those on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can assure themselves <hi>that all things shall work together for their good</hi>; all others may expect, and shall find all to turn to their harm: How shall that man comfort himself with such an Hope that this or that person is in Eternal Glory, who hath no ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hopes that he himself shall ever come there? He may be in his conscience perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that such an one is gone to Heaven, but it is another thing to entertain such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion with Hope: Hope is that in the exercise whereof the Soul is relieved, but what relief can an unbeliever have by such a perswasion, yea it is the Spirits work to give us the Consolation of our Hope, that it may have real refreshing in it, but such have not received the Spirit, and therefore can be under no such influence.</p>
                  <p>To think our departed friends are in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and to expect ourselves when we dye to go down to the Pit of Destruction, can give no Hope at all. Where Faith doth not lie in the Foundation, there can be no Spiritual

                  <p n="2">2. Be very Faithful in doing of your Duty to your Friends whiles they live with you. As God is wont very often to give his blessing unto the use of means, by making it successful in the thing intended, so usually he affords the greatest comfort to those who being bound in Duty so to use them, are accordingly most careful and conscientious therein. And on the other Hand, it oftentimes so falls out, that God brings about his Holy Purposes of destroying some sinners, by suffering of those under whose care and watch they were, to be remisse and negligent in the discharge of their Duty to them. <hi>Eli,</hi> in a great measure neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects his Duty to his Sons, and God tells him of it, but he mends it not, and the reason is, because <hi>God would destroy them</hi>; and it is not recorded for nothing concerning <hi>Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nijah,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 1.6 <hi>that his Father had not displeased him at any time, in saying why hast thou done so?</hi> and this becomes not only a righteous punishment of them that perish, but a just chastisement of the others neglect; there are the Relative Duties which we owe one to another, and when they are sincerely discharged, this will afford good nourishment

unto hope: we owe to our Children, when they are grown up to a capacity of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction, good example, a restraining them from exhorbitant courses, a teaching of them the good word, and ways of God, and this is the way in which God hath said he will bestow the blessing upon them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 18.19. let us then be careful in this matter; &amp; here;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do it speedily. Take the season whilst you may; use the opportunity while it is in your hand. Their lives are uncertain, their times are in Gods Hand, and if we use unnecessary delays, feed our selves with purposes to do it afterwards, thinking that it is now too soon; the time may be lapsed, and they may be gone to the grave; and then to be sure they will be out of the reach of our ever doing any thing more for them.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> Do it throughly. Be not perfunctory in this matter; be very serious in the work; it is a great thing, and of unspeakable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: it is not to be done to the halves. How shall we expect them to be in good ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest in minding these things, if we are not so in our pursuit of them? let not careless<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, fond indulgence, sinister ends, or worldly affairs put us by any part of our Duty which we ow to them; Think not our care of their Souls to be the least or last care incumbent on us: what Christ bids us to do for our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, we should endeavour for ours also<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Do it perseveringly; though you should meet with a great many lets and discourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments lying in your way, yet resolve to break through them all: though you can see no present good coming of all your pains and endeavours, though they should slight and despise, and grow more vain and obstinate under and after all; yet do you commend your endeavours to God, and set to it afresh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> think with your selves, if at the last you may but obtain what you long for, your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour will be satisfactorily recompensed: we are bidden <hi>not to be weary of well doing,</hi> and <hi>in the morning to sow our seed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Take all the encouragements that God hath given you to strengthen your Hope by<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God hath seen meet to afford his people a great deal, to establish their hope withal; and if we would have it in exercise we must make use of it accordingly: In particular<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p n="1">1. Live upon the New Covenant promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. Though God hath not given us any particular absolute promise, that this or that relation of ours shall be made happy in the everlasting enjoyment of himself when they dy, yet he hath afforded to us many encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging promises concerning them, as hath been exemplified in the explication. He hath promised that <hi>our labour shall not be in

vain</hi>; he hath promised to be <hi>a God to our Children</hi>; he hath promised, that if <hi>they seek him he will be found of them</hi>; and now there is occasion for our making use of these and the like promises; and though they will not amount to full assurance, yet they will give strength to Hope.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Eye and observe the Providence of God in his answering of your endeavours with them. Take notice what effect your labour and pains have upon them. It is not enough for us to sow the seed, but we are to be watchfully looking for its coming up, and to observe how it thrives: and if you can discern them to be serious, willing to take counsel, and hearken to your advise; if you can find that they bring forth any fruit which is becoming them; and according to the Word of God, you are to receive this as an answer of your Prayers, and a token for good: and now you may comfortably recollect the remembrance of this, when they are gone; and bear up your spirits therewithal: and the more memorials you have of such things as these the more let your hearts be encouraged, and your hopes strengthned thereby: the neglect of thus doing, many times leaves us at a loss, and under prevailing fears.</p>

                     <pb n="135" facs="unknown:000583_0138_0FA71213732C6720"/>4. Be not ignorant. Our Apostle ascribes the immoderate sorrow of Christians to this. <hi>Text.</hi> where under <hi>Ignorance</hi> is comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, a <hi>not knowing, a not believing, and a not considering:</hi> for that which we do not give credit to, or do not apply our thoughts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, we may be said practically not to know; and for help against this in particular;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Do not fix their happiness, or your comfort in them to life and time; what the Apostle saith, 1 Cor. 25.19. <hi>If our hope in Christ were for this life only, we were of all men most miserable,</hi> is applicable not with respect to our selves only, but to ours too. If all the comfort, and ioy, and hope which we have in our relations, be only temporal; if we look no farther than the present, their Death will cut all off at one stroak. This was one great reason why the <hi>Heathen</hi> sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed so hopelesly; because they knew so little about the after-state of men: but God hath given his People full assurance in his Word about these things: believe then firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and meditate frequently in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Resurrection</hi>; think of the state of men after time, and draw what you may from thence.

future happy condition of the People of God. It is not enough to believe that there is an after-state, but our hope lies in think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what that shall be: The Word of God hath told us as much of it, as is meet for us to know in this life; and let us be pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering often upon it: think what great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries they must be, of which <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that it is not <hi>lawful to utter them</hi>; what it is to dwell with God and Christ for ever; what is that <hi>Eternal Life</hi> and those <hi>Joyes for evermore,</hi> which shall entertain them after <hi>they are here no more.</hi>
                  </p>
