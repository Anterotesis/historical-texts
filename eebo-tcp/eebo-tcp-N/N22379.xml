            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Narrative cannot, we conceive, be injurious to any perſon, and to many it may be uſeful and edifying. The ſimplicity and frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with which it is given, ought to be numbered among its recommendations.</p>
            <p>The regular and reſpectable family to which the young woman belongs; and the wiſhes of her connexions, claim our attention, and induce us to give theſe teſtimonials. Her life and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion well agree with her Chriſtian profeſſion. The bodily diſorders under which ſhe has labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the exerciſes of her mind, have at times been very powerful and violent: But under every calamity ſhe has been remarkably patient.</p>
            <p>It is not incumbent on us at this time to trace the efficient cauſes of her illneſſes and recoveries, nor to give any direct teſtimony with regard to her mental exerciſes; but to afford ſuch evidence to the truth of her narration as lies within our power. And we are willing to embrace this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to affirm, That the account which <hi>MARY SPAULDING</hi> gives of herſelf well correſponds to our own obſervation in caſes within our knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, and with the declaration of the family and neighbours in other inſtances. But with regard to her exerciſes of mind, we do not pretend to
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:029554_0003_0FE1E1129F7B8E18"/>determine. Theſe lie beyond our reach. She muſt ſtand or fall before her own Maſter. But from the character ſhe has ſuſtained, and from converſation with her, we are led to believe that ſhe is a perſon of real piety, and that ſhe means to ſpeak the words of truth and ſoberneſs.</p>
            <p>We hope this narrative will anſwer all thoſe good effects which it is deſigned to produce, and that ſhe will enjoy the favour and bleſſing of God, in whoſe hand our breath is, and who in the midſt of judgment remembers mercy.</p>

            <head>A Remarkable Narrative, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEREAS it hath pleaſed Almighty God to viſit me in years paſt with much ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pain and diſtreſs, at different times and in various ways, it becomes me to be hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble before him, and to notice all his dealings with me. And as He hath ſeen fit again to reſtore me to health and ſtrength in a very remarkable manner, it is my deſire to make mention of his kindneſs, and to give glory to his great Name.</p>
            <p>That I might not forget the wonderful things the Lord hath done for me, I have kept an account of the chief events which have happened to me for a number of years paſt. Many of my friends and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance have expreſſed a deſire to have the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count made public; and having taken the matter under ſerious conſideration, I now think it to be my duty to let the world know what God hath done for my body, and what he hath done for my ſoul. I ſhall therefore proceed to give ſome account of my ſickneſs,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:029554_0004_0FE1E114E8049160"/>and of the exerciſes of my mind; but ſhall confine myſelf to the particulars, leſt I ſhould be thought too lengthy.—</p>
            <p>WHEN I was about ten years old, I dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a very uncommon dream, which put me on ſerious inquiries, and led me for a while to conſider on my ways. But being young and gay, my mind was ſoon lightened of its burden, and my ſeriouſneſs almoſt left me. The young company I kept, engaged much of my time and attention, and I was led ſtep by ſtep into the follies and vanities of the world. I had many calls, but I turned a deaf ear to them.</p>
            <p>On the 5th of July, 1786, (being that day 17 years old) I was taken with a ſevere fit of ſickneſs, of a nervous kind. I was reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo low by this illneſs, that I did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to recover; and ſeveral times the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought I was dying; one night in partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular they could not perceive (as they have ſince told me) that I had life in me. I have often been told that for above forty nights together I was not known to ſleep ſo much as one hour.</p>
            <p>When I had my reaſon, I thought death was very near, even at the door. I was told that, if I believed in Chriſt, I ſhould be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and I did believe that there was a God, and a Chriſt, and hoped that I ſhould be ſaved; but I did not know that I muſt firſt have a new heart. It however pleaſed God
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:029554_0004_0FE1E114E8049160"/>to raiſe me from that ſickneſs to a comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble meaſure of health.</p>
            <p>About this time there was a reformation in <hi>Weſtford,</hi> and I was greatly deſirous that there might be one in this town, and among my mates, and then I thought I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in religion. The thought of being <hi>firſt</hi> was painful to me, becauſe I ſuppoſed others would condemn and deſpiſe me for it. And therefore I concluded to put it off till a more convenient time, hoping that ſomething would awaken the attention of people to the great things of religion. But before a more convenient ſeaſon arrived, I was again ſeized with a ſevere illneſs which ſoon deprived me of my reaſon. But although my reaſon after a few days was again reſtored in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I was entirely deprived of the uſe of my limbs. I was unable to move hand or foot. My conſtitution appeared to be faſt debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and I was in great pain and diſtreſs. The family once or twice thought I was breathing my laſt, and called in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to ſee me expire. Although I expected in a few minutes to be in eternity, death did not appear to be dreſſed in terror. But all this time I did not know the nature of the <hi>new birth.</hi> Had I then died, what would have become of me!</p>
            <p>But God was pleaſed to raiſe me from this ſickneſs, ſo that I was comfortable, although very weak and feeble. My mind dwelt much upon the following words—<hi>Now is the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:029554_0005_0FE1E11C9E27B618"/>time.</hi> And conſidering the ſtate of my body, I thought I muſt comply with the conditions of pardon <hi>now or never</hi>; that I muſt make my peace with God <hi>now or never.</hi> And I often thought on thoſe words of our Saviour—<hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> John iii.3. And I did greatly deſire to know what the new birth was, and I was much in prayer, and hoped to be accepted on that account. But on the 29th of October, I was again ſeized, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to my bed, and was ſo delirious that I knew but little of my ſickneſs. At length, my reaſon having returned, I heard my Nurſe reading theſe lines, in which Chriſt ſpeaks to Youth:—
<q>
                  <l>Unto thyſelf I will thee leave,</l>
                  <l>That Satan may thee wholly have:</l>
                  <l>Thy heart in ſin will harden'd be,</l>
                  <l>And blinded in iniquity.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe words ſunk deep into my heart, and led me to a ſenſe of my ſinful ſtate, to which I had been almoſt a ſtranger. My mind was in great diſtreſs. My ſins appeared very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and aggravating, on every ſide. I looked back upon the precious time I had ſpent in vanity, and conſidered how many calls and warnings I had received and ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the gracious offers of pardon I had neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and had refuſed to comply with, that I might have life. I was afraid that the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers which I had rejected would never again be renewed. For ſome time I read and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:029554_0005_0FE1E11C9E27B618"/>ſtudied my bible; but every thing I found was againſt me, and I laid it aſide. I then took up a book, on the great concern of a preparation for death, but it would not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part any comfort. My diſtreſs and agony of ſoul were too great for language to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. Thoſe who have experienced the ſame can <hi>feel</hi> better than I can <hi>deſcribe</hi> them. When I looked up for mercy, it ſeemed that God and Chriſt were turned againſt me. The gate of heaven appeared to be cloſed, while the doors of hell ſtood wide open to receive me. My life appeared to be very ſhort, and my mind was heavineſs, and my heart was ſorrow.</p>
            <p>Reading nothing but the Dialogue between Chriſt and Youth, referred to above, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a very gloomy frame of mind, my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents wiſhed to know the cauſe of my trouble, and what it was that took ſuch hold of me; but I was unwilling to explain the matter, and put them off. However, the young woman who ſlept with me inſiſted one night that I ſhould tell her what laboured ſo much in my mind. Then I opened my mind to her by aſking this queſtion —If you was in a dungeon, and never expected to come out again, could you take any comfort? She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, "I ſuppoſe I could not." I told her then ſhe need not think ſtrange that my mind was in ſuch a troubled ſtate. She ſaid—"You will not always think ſo; put your truſt in God and go to ſleep."—Theſe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:029554_0006_0FE1E11F8041EB00"/>words increaſed my diſtreſs, and I was thrown into great temptations. The chief I attempted to ſay was, "Lord be merciful to me a ſinner." In this unhappy condition I remained for ſome time; but at length it pleaſed the God of all comfort to open my eyes, and give me ſuch a view of divine things as I never before experienced. O what ſweet views I had of Chriſt and of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things! The paſſages of ſcripture which crowded themſelves into my mind came with peculiar ſweetneſs and melody; they brought joy and gladneſs to my heart. And if, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, you wiſh to know what portions of holy writ had ſuch a powerful efficacy upon me, you may at your leiſure turn to Matth. vii.7, 8. and to Iſai. lv.6. You may alſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Matth. xi.28, 29. And theſe texts are adapted, it ſeems to me, to fill every thirſty, longing ſoul with joy and comfort.</p>
            <p>My heart was filled with love to God and to Chriſt. When I conſidered what great things had been done for me, my thankful joy was greater than I can expreſs. I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared myſelf to a brand taken out of the burning. At once I was ſet at liberty and eaſe. And I have often compared my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that of a perſon kept in a dark dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, without ever ſeeing the light, and after many years is brought ſuddenly into a clear and bright ſunſhine. By attending to this compariſon, any one may form ſome opinion
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:029554_0006_0FE1E11F8041EB00"/>how things appeared at that joyous moment. But all the glory is due to God for it.</p>
            <p>On the 29th of December, I was taken with a fever, attended with nervous ſymptoms, whereby I was confined till March following. And during this ſickneſs I was brought very low, ſo that I was unable to ſpeak a loud word for ſeveral weeks, and my phyſician thought me very dangerous. But though he and all my friends almoſt deſpaired of my life, I had inward joy, and it was my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing belief that I ſhould recover. For though at ſome particular hours I felt almoſt diſcouraged, yet in general I was confident that I ſhould be raiſed from my bed of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtreſs. After my firſt ſickneſs, I had a ſtrong impreſſion made upon my mind, one day when I was alone, that I ſhould be ſick ſeveral times, and at laſt ſhould recover my health. And afterwards I twice dreamed that I muſt go through many trials, and that I ſhould frequently be ſick, and then recover perfect health. But the impreſſion made by theſe things was not ſufficiently deep and laſting. I could not bring my mind to the firm belief that all this would happen to me. But at length my mind laboured through all the difficulties which it found in its way, and I was ſatisfied that I ſhould again recover ſtrength. And all the reſt of my ſickneſs excepting a few hours, I felt perſuaded that I ſhould be raiſed to health before I left the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:029554_0007_0FE1E1211B4CB948"/>world. And glory be to God, I have realized what I then expected.</p>
            <p>The deſign of my hiſtory does not require me to deſcend to particulars; and therefore I would mention in general, that from July the 5th, 1786, to July 10th, 1794, I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined on the irkſome bed of ſickneſs fourteen times, and ſeveral times I was viewed as a dying perſon, and more than once it was ſaid of me, as I have been ſince told, that my breath was gone. On the 11th of Auguſt, 1787, I was ſeized with the cramp in my ſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach, with other complaints. I was ſoon ſo fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and relaxed that I could not even whiſper, and by moving in the moſt gentle manner my bones left their ſockets. If a perſon ſhook or even wiped my hand, the jar would diſplace the bones of my fingers. But almoſt the whole time during this ſevere illneſs I expected to recover. In the year 1788, on the 17th of April, a ſore began to diſcover itſelf in my ſide; and in the courſe of ten weeks it gathered and broke ſeveral times, not externally, but by diſcharging large quantities of purulent matter through the urinary paſſages. This ſickneſs was the moſt ſevere and painful that I had ever endured, and it continued about three months. Eight or nine weeks of the time I was rocked in a cradle day and night. It ſeemed that ſleep had almoſt departed from me. Sometimes I could ſleep a few minutes in the morning, but I was not known to ſleep one minute in
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:029554_0007_0FE1E1211B4CB948"/>night time for ſeveral weeks. But though I was extremely weak and feeble, I expected to recover, except one day when the inward ſore in my ſide was at its greateſt degree of ſoreneſs and pain, and when, as the Doctor has told me, my diſorders were at their criſis. At this time my belief of recovery was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what weakened; for I was unable to open my eyes or move my lips, and all the nour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment I took was given me upon the end of a feather. But at all other periods of my ſickneſs, I was perſuaded that I ſhould recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. And I have often thought that if a jury of Doctors and all my friends had told me there was no hope of getting well, my confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent perſuaſion would have remained. Some of my friends plainly told me there was no proſpect of my reſtoration, and thought it wrong in me to indulge ſuch an idea. They ſaid, I muſt not think that becauſe the Lord had done great things for me, he would do greater. To this, reply was made by ſigns; and I replied that I was ſenſible that God had really done great things for me, and I believed he would raiſe me to health: but I felt myſelf unworthy of the leaſt favour from him, and I could hardly account for my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. For I often thought that, if I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for an exchange of worlds, I ſhould prefer death to life. I was afraid, that in caſe I recovered, I ſhould be led into ſin and wickedneſs; and the thoughts of ſinning againſt God, were more diſtreſſing to me
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:029554_0008_0FE1E122B1E57BB8"/>than all the pains I bore. I deſired, howev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to be reſigned to God's holy will, and feit grateful to him for that degree of ſubmiſſion which I experienced in the courſe of my ſickneſs. But on a certain night, (and I hope I ſhall always remember it with humility) my bodily pains increaſed to the keeneſt torture, and I began to murmur and complain. I inquired of myſelf what I had done, that I muſt ſuffer ſo much more than others round me.</p>
            <p>In ſuffering ſuch pain and diſtreſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out eaſe and ſleep, I thought my affliction greater than I could bear. Then was I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that God's will ſhould be done. When in this ſtate of mind, the following lines, in a ſudden and powerful manner, dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into my mind:
<q>
                  <l>Why are you now in this diſtreſs,</l>
                  <l>For in my boſom there is reſt;</l>
                  <l>It is a place prepar'd for thee,</l>
                  <l>Now let your heart contented be.</l>
               </q>
My mind was then carried to theſe lines:
<q>
                  <l>Be patient, then, frail fleſh,</l>
                  <l>In patience hold thy tongue;</l>
                  <l>And murmur not againſt the Lord,</l>
                  <l>As if he did thee wrong,</l>
                  <l>Juſtice can do no wrong,</l>
                  <l>Nor mercy cruel be,</l>
                  <l>Wiſdom ſees thy ſad eſtate</l>
                  <l>To be the beſt for thee.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Then I thought I could ſay, <hi>Lord, thy will be done.</hi> From this time I remained in a fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſtate for a long time. I was ſo weak and
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:029554_0008_0FE1E122B1E57BB8"/>relaxed, that for two years I ſeldom or ever dreſſed or undreſſed me, or turned myſelf in bed, without putting ſome bone out of joint.<note n="*" place="bottom">My ſurgeon affirms that he replaced one of my ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders nine times in one evening, which was diſlocated by ſpaſms.</note> But the Lord was pleaſed to be with me, and to give me great comfort in diſtreſs. My comfort was ſo much greater than my diſtreſs, that I never was more contented and reſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all my life! And I deſired to give glory to God for it, for I was as much indebted to him for my patience as I was for my breath.</p>
            <p>In the year 1791, I was ſome better, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to gain ſtrength, and do ſome light work. And in 1792, I was ſo well as ſometimes to do a day's work in a day. In this time, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, my ſide was daily painful. When I took any cold, or overdid myſelf, it would ſwell and be very troubleſome to me. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this time I was too much taken up with the world, and did not live in ſuch nearneſs to God as I ought. Engaged in vanity, I gave ſuch a wound to religion as has cauſed me many a ſorrowful hour. But I hope I ſhall be forgiven both by God and man. And my friends, I beg your prayers for me that I may live in greater nearneſs to the great and glorious God. And may we all, who have named the name of Chriſt, be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that we reſolve and do the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <l>O, my friends; how can we bear</l>
                  <l>To live but even one hour here,</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:029554_0009_0FE1E12F064BE870"/>Without we live unto the Lord,</l>
                  <l>According to his holy word.</l>
                  <l>This world allures to Satan's ſnare;</l>
                  <l>Hence we muſt take the greater care</l>
                  <l>How we do live and walk therein,</l>
                  <l>Leſt we be drawn to pride and ſin.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In the year 1793, Nov. 26, I was again ſeized with the cramp in my ſtomach, and was very weak and low through the following winter. But in April I rode out for my health, and unluckily fell from my horſe, and ſplit the principal bone in my right arm. On the 30th of April, I was taken with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent fever, attended with other diſorders. Having my arm broken, and being infeſted with various diſorders, my outward trials and ſufferings were very great. But I thought I ſhould be willing to undergo any thing, if it might be the means of making me live in greater nearneſs to God. The internal ſore in my ſide had gathered ſeveral times, and was then worſe than ever. For more than ſix years, my ſide had been daily painful to me, and at this time the pain was very diſtreſſing. At length the ſore broke, and the pain abated, and I collected ſtrength enough to walk out and to ride ſeveral times. But on the 7th of July, my diſorders raged with more than double violence. I was ſeized as was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, with the numb-palſy over my left ſide; and beſides this, I had an attack of the lock-jaw. My arm, hand and eye upon my left ſide were entirely uſeleſs, and I was unable to move my tongue. But all this time my
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:029554_0009_0FE1E12F064BE870"/>reaſon was preſerved to me. And, though in a great meaſure ſenſible of my ſituation, my mind was impreſſed with theſe words,— <hi>This ſickneſs ſhall not be unto death, but for the glory of God.</hi> And I expected, that in the uſe of means, attended with the bleſſing of Heaven, I ſhould recover, as I had often thought before. Though I was under heavy trials, the Lord ſeemed near to me, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported me under them. During this time, all the food I took was of a liquid kind, and ran between my teeth, which ſeemed to others as well as to myſelf to be firmly ſet. Under theſe difficulties, the ſuſtenance I took was next to none. My ſtrength failed, and the pain in my jaw increaſed very faſt, and ſleep almoſt departed. In this unhappy condition I remained till the 10th day, when, early in the morning, I gave ſome token to be raiſed up. I was then put into a chair, in which I leaned back till my bed was made; but when I was laid down again, it ſeemed that my ſtrength and life were almoſt gone. But I ſtill believed that I ſhould recover. And while I was thinking what means could with ſucceſs be uſed for my reſtoration, and of what uſe health would be to me, I was led to think, (and the thought came with great pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,) that Chriſt was as able to raiſe me with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out means as with them, and that his power muſt be exerted in either caſe. I thought that if I had faith in him he could raiſe me to health and eaſe, and that I ſhould riſe
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:029554_0010_0FE1E1314A107250"/>ſuddenly and walk the room. But conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my diſorders and trials, I had no reaſon to expect any thing of this kind would take place; and I was at times afraid it was a ſin to hearken to ſuch a thought, and therefore tried to put it from me; but the more I made the attempt, the more it ſeemed to be fixed and ſettled in my mind. I was led to the idea that all things are poſſible to them that believe; and that if my faith did not fail me, I ſhould be ſet free from all pain and diſtreſs. My mind dwelt upon this text,—<hi>They that have faith as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, and ſhould ſay to a mountain, Be thou removed into the ſea, nothing doubting, it ſhould be done.</hi> And I also thought of the woman, who believed that if ſhe could touch the hem of Chriſt's garment, ſhe ſhould be made whole. And other por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſcripture of this import came to my mind with great power. And though great were the trials of my faith, it pleaſed Him, who over-rules all things, to bring me into a more ſettled belief of a ſpeedy recovery.</p>
            <p>It then appeared plain to me what I ſhould be raiſed for, and it was a ſolemn thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. It ſeemed to me that I ſhould be rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that I might ſpeak to thoſe around me, <hi>to improve time better.</hi> But I was at firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to do it, and made a number of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes. I thought I could not have a face to ſpeak to any, conſidering what a life I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had lived. I was ſenſible that I never could in any matter expreſs my ideas as I
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:029554_0010_0FE1E1314A107250"/>ſhould be glad to; and I knew I was very ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant, and ſo could not be capable of teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing others. My mind at this time was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged on the ſubject.</p>
            <p>My thoughts and excuſes which then em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed my attention may be found in the fourth chapter of Exodus, from the 10th to the 13th verſe, and in the firſt chapter of Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah, from the 6th to the 10th verſe.</p>
            <p>At length I was made willing, and felt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to God's will. And then I laid wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the minute to come when I ſhould riſe. While thus waiting, I was thrown into great diſtreſs for breath, like a perſon dying. I was aſked whether I was dying, and I made ſigns that I was not; and my faith and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence remained. My diſtreſs continued about half an hour, and when it was greateſt, my numbneſs, my pain and diſtreſs left me, and I immediately aroſe from my bed of ſickneſs, and ſeemed to be conſtrained to ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter theſe words;—<hi>In the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, I am commanded to ariſe from this bed of ſickneſs, and to walk and to praiſe him.</hi> I then felt free from all my infirmities. In a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I was, it ſeemed to me, in perfect health and eaſe. My heart was filled with joy and with praiſe, to that great and glorious God who had appeared for me; and I called upon all who ſtood by to praiſe the Lord with me. I deſired that my Miniſter and my neighbours might be ſent for; and when they came, they were ſtruck with great ſurpriſe, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiced
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:029554_0011_0FE1E132E15C3110"/>with me in my recovery. I deſired them all to join with me in praiſing the Lord for his great goodneſs to me. I wiſhed all to unite in prayer and praiſe to God, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the Rev. Mr. Packard to lead in our devotions. And after prayer, we ſang the 116th pſalm, firſt part.</p>
            <p>O how grateful and happy I felt! I can never expreſs the exerciſes of my mind, nor the grateful feelings of my heart. And I hope I ſhall never forget the great things which God hath done for me.</p>
            <p>Thus, Reader, have I attempted to give thee a true, though ſhort, account of my various ſickneſſes and frequent recoveries. And my earneſt deſire and prayer is, that thou mayeſt love and ſerve that God who hath been thus kind and gracious to me, and that thou may<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enjoy his favour and the rewards of his heavenly kingdom.</p>
            <p>I gladly embrace this opportunity, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ſincere thanks to my friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, for their attention and kindneſs to me, and I hope they will be bleſſed with the beſt of Heaven's bleſſings. Come, my friends, behold and ſee the wonderful things which a merciful God hath done for me, who am a poor, ſinful, unworthy worm of the duſt. His gracious dealings with me are more than I can utter, and therefor I wiſh you would ſtill join with me in praiſing his holy name. And I humbly beg your prayers for me, that I may walk in the ways of religion, that I
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:029554_0011_0FE1E132E15C3110"/>may be weaned from every ſin, and that I may daily grew in grace and in the knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. While I live, may I live in the ſervice and to the honour of my Maker, Preſerver, and Judge.</p>
            <p>I am unwilling to lay aſide my pen, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out writing a few words to my friends.—</p>

                  <p>THOSE of you who have reaſon to think you have received the new birth, and who have begun a Chriſtian courſe, and promiſed to be for God, and to promote religion, will permit me to uſe freedom and plainneſs with you. Do not let pride and unbelief, nor the frowns and flatteries of the world, nor any temptation, prevent you from being faithful to God, and true to your Lord and Maſter. For if God be on your ſide, who can be and prevail againſt you? Let it be your ſtudy and endeavour to bring honour to religion, and to glorify God. Pleaſe to take an early opportunity to read 1 Corinth. xv.58. and Epheſians vi.10—19. And may the God of grace be with you, and bleſs you.</p>
                  <p>And thoſe of you, my friends, who are yet ſtrangers to vital religion and real holineſs, and who have not received the new birth, will allow me to addreſs you in the words of truth and ſoberneſs.</p>
                  <p>Do conſider what a ſtate you are in. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what our Saviour told Nicodemus—
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:029554_0012_0FE1E13B490069B0"/>
                     <hi>Except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God.</hi> And it is ſaid, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die.</hi> May you ſoon turn, and break off your ſins by righteouſneſs. Come unto Chriſt that you may have life; for he is ready to receive you with open arms, on the terms of the goſpel. And there are many calls in God's word, and many invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for ſinners to forſake their ſins and to come to Chriſt. And how often are theſe calls repeated to youth! <hi>Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth. They that ſeek me early ſhall find me. Seek ye the Lord while he may be found; call ye upon him while he is near. Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him turn unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon. Aſk, and it ſhall be given you; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be opened unto you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>May you daily ſearch the word of God, which was given for our rule and guide, and may God give you grace to underſtand it, and to behave according to it. Delay not the great concerns of the ſoul. Improve the preſent time while you have health and ſtrength, and while your reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are preſerved to you. Should you be brought to a ſick bed, and then look back and find that you had diſhonoured God and neglected religion, what pain and diſtreſs would faſten on your ſoul! Now live as you would wiſh you had, when you come to die.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:029554_0012_0FE1E13B490069B0"/>Let it be your greateſt concern to get an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Chriſt. Conſider that you are not certain of one day; and if you were certain of it, you might not have the offer of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For God ſays, <hi>My Spirit ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſtrive with man. But, To-day if ye will hear my voice, harden not your heart. Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day, of ſalvation.</hi> As the word of God calls you to attend to your ſoul's affairs to-day, how dare you put it off till to-morrow! You know not but that to-morrow will be too late. Therefore, my friends, do not put off this great work any longer. And may God grant, for his Son's ſake, that you may devote your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and all you have to the ſervice of God. And may you now reſolve, that in Chriſt's ſtrength, you will be for God and for no other; and take the word of God for your rule, and cry earneſtly to him for his Spirit, to lead you into the right way, and keep you in it. And may the God of all grace be with you, and guide you through time, and bring you at laſt to his heavenly kingdom.</p>
