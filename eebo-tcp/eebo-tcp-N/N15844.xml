            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS illiberality is the offspring of weakness and of ignorance—as the great and the good are ever possessed of candid minds, the present speaker presumes he has less to fear from the severity, than to hope from the candour, of this enlightened and respectable auditory. He may, therefore, venture, notwithstanding his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability, to proceed in attempting to discharge the duty assigned him by the society of the Cincinnati.</p>
            <p>AGREEABLY, then, to their expectations and the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate of the day, we shall turn our attention to the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican Independence.</p>
            <p>THE desire of pleasing is a principle in human nature. But as this passion can never be virtuously indulged at the expence of truth and sincerity, an attempt to catch the popular ear, or flatter the reigning prejudices of the day, forms no part of the present design.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:020245_0004_0FAE94A0C2584FB0"/>
THE American revolution is an event illustrious in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and important in its consequences. To rear and establish an empire was an enterprize bold and arduous. The attempt awakened all the active powers of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind, and seemed to add fresh vigour to its native elasticity. America friendless and alone, but collected within herself, setting at defiance the power of Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, presents us with a most dignified and majestick picture of true greatness. In considering the rights of human nature, in contemplating the respect which she owed to herself, she was elevated above the sense of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; and so intent was she in investigating the policy, that she seemed to forget the power of her oppressors. While Britain, on the other hand, dazzled with the lustre of her own greatness, lost sight of one of those invalua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble rights for which she herself had often and profusely bled. To secure the rights of property, and the safety of their persons, against the depredations and outrages of lawless power, Englishmen had plunged their swords into the breasts of Englishmen, and their soil had been freely watered with their choicest blood.</p>
            <p>BUT in their conduct towards this country they were guilty of a treacherous inversion of their own maxims,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020245_0005_0FAE94A1787F9B98"/>
The right, not only of <hi>taxing us without our consent,</hi> but <hi>of binding us in all cases whatsoever,</hi> though at first only secretly whispered in their cabinet, was at length openly claimed in the face of the world. America, at once saw the force of the principle, while as yet it existed but in theory, and had too much wisdom and spirit to submit to the ignominious experiment. Her <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> was not, like that of the United Netherlands, the impulse of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, but the result of cool deliberate reasoning. Banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the blessings of the British constitution, resist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance became the only alternative; and the precarious events of a war were prefered to certain servitude.</p>
            <p>THE situation of America for some time after the commencement of hostilities, from opposing the power of the King of England while she recognized his sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, was extremely ungraceful. But so equivocal, though necessary line of conduct did not comport with the dignity of her spirit and genius. As, while she ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged herself to be a part of the British empire, she would have no rational hope of foreign assistance, and was herself, indeed, contending without an object, a formal, and an explicit assumption of sovereign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, was the dictate of wisdom and of prudence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:020245_0006_0FAE94A23B3545B8"/>
ACCORDINGLY, on the auspicious day we now cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate, the illustrious fathers of our country, by a most solemn act, announced to the world, the claims of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica to Independence and empire. A day never to be forgotten! An act ever to be admired! An act which for conciseness and precision, for majesty of expression and loftiness of thought, stands unrivaled among the literary productions of this, or any former age—an act, it is but just to add, which does infinite honour to those bold and generous patriots who gave it their sanction; and which cannot fail to transmit their names with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing applause through all succeeding time.</p>
            <p>As magnanimity, and boldness of mind, had thus marked the American councils, the further prosecution of war was evincive of her persevering firmness, sound wisdom and military prowess. From her own bosom she was able to call forth, both for the Senate and for the field, such characters as her situation demanded. And while she can boast the purity of her cause, she can boast also of patriots and heroes who added lustre to the cause itself. None of the various vicissitudes of her fortune were able to shake the resolution she had taken to establish her liberties, or to check the efforts of her freeborn soul; but, supported by the virtue and patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otism
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020245_0007_0FAE94A2F45F8050"/>
of her sons, she persisted in the long and arduous conflict, till, at length covered with glory, and unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in fame, she rose in triumph superior to all her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and effected an honourable, a glorious peace. A peace, transcending her expectations, and equal to her most sanguine wishes. Happy moment! when the din of arms and the toils of war should yield to the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful pleasures of domestick life!</p>
            <p>IN the full possession of peace, liberty and independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence—remote from the seats of foreign empires—unen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled with their politicks and uncontaminated with their vices—masters of a grateful soil in a healthful climate, to what heights of grandeur and felicity might she not have aspired! Could any one have conceived that a people who had given such signal displays of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and patriotism, under circumstances the most dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tressing—who for eight long years had supported a war of virtue, should soon, very soon, so far forget their own dignity and interest, as to abuse their liberty, and pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute it to the vile purposes of licentiousness? Yes: the comprehensive genius of a WASHINGTON foresaw, and his honest patriotism pointed out, <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide circular letter.</note> the humiliating danger.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:020245_0008_0FAE94A644127EE8"/>
NOTWITHSTANDING the national spirit that discover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itself during the war, we are now compelled to believe that the union of the states, during that period, was the effect either of a momentary sense of danger, or, at best, of a transient glow of patriotism. A review of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and manners of the people of this Country, through the various stages of their progress from dependence to empire, compared with the present, forces to confess that the ascent to greatness, however hazardous, is more pleasing to the great mass of mankind, than the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of those virtues, which can alone secure respectabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the calm season of peace.</p>
            <p>As the States had one common enemy, they had one common interest; the force of which rendered them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensible to a variety of separate, inferiour interests, which peace alone could unfold and bring into view. So soon, therefore, as the impulse of foreign force was removed, the little politicks of each state engrossed the publick at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention—federal ideas were obscured, and the national character has been falling a victim to local prejudices. Ever since the war the states have been receding from each other, and from their common center, till the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of political attraction has become almost impercepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:020245_0009_0FAE94A72921FFB0"/>
How these states are to be re-united, and the unity of the national character and government preserved, are questions already highly momentous; but are daily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming more interesting, as they are rapidly advancing to a practical decision. A federal system, differently modified from the present, may probably be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a view to effectuate these immense objects. But how far a government <hi>meerly</hi> federal is calculated to answer these purposes,—how far such a government, is, in the present state of things, practicable, time alone will fully determine. Reasonings founded in the nature and general principles of government will not satisfy the mind on this subject, as coercion, the great animating principle of every government, is, and perhaps must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily be wanting.</p>
            <p>ANCIENT Greece was divided into a great number of independent republics. They had, however, their fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral constitution, and their council of amphyctyons. But was their confederation capable of controuling those jealous, proud, aspiring states? The reverse is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest from their perpetual and depopulating wars. What, though the arms of Persia might for a time unite them, this danger removed they cordially returned to their too common employment, the butchery of each
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020245_0010_0FAE94A87B7A7C78"/>
other. The analogy between those celebrated repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, and our own, is strikingly obvious; and their history, painful as it is in the perusal, is replete with instructions to this our country. They rioted in their wild tumultuous liberty, till the enterprizing Philip put an end at once to their convulsions and to their freedom.</p>
            <p>THE Helvetick league in modern times, has assumed the appearance of consistence and of union. But to their poverty, and their mountains—the jealousies and the continual pressure of surrounding nations, may not this be ascribed, rather than to the efficacy of their fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral constitution?</p>
            <p>NOR can we predicate any thing more favourable from the intricate system of the United Netherlands. Although they are surrounded by potent neighbours, by whose arms they seem liable to be overwhelmed, their constitution is too feeble to preserve them from those violent political agitations, which are inconsistent with an efficacious, well-organized government. The Hollanders themselves, indeed, by dispensing in times of danger, with their usual and constitutional forms of legislation, implicitly acknowledge the preposterous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their national system of jurisprudence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:020245_0011_0FAE94A8F63F7F38"/>
To these instances may we not add the testimony of our own experience. We have been witnesses of the decline, and almost utter extinction, as well as of the rise and progress of a federal system—sufficient, perhaps, to convince us of the necessity of a great national con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of government, formed with all those powers, those checks and balances, which may be necessary to give it energy, on the one hand, and to secure the, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the people, on the other. What indeed can preserve the publick liberty but an efficient, energetick government, founded in just principles, and dispensing equal laws? So far is such a government from endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering the liberties of the people, that it insures to them the highest possible degree of protection. The extremes of almost every thing in the moral and political world are nearly allied. The excess of virtue is vice; and the extremes of liberty border on despotism.</p>
            <p>MONEY is the sinew of government as well as of war. To call it forth with certainty—in such quantities and in such only as the public exigencies demand, and in a manner most easy to the people, is the perfection of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislation. But to effect these important points, is it not essential that one undivided, integral, though balanced, government should be established, the influence of which

should operate directly upon the individual constituents of it without the intervention of local, or subordinate legislatures?</p>
            <p>AMONG the various causes of the present distress of our country perhaps none has been more capitally influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ential, than the want of a well-toned, national govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The levity and disrespect with which many of the recommendations and requisitions of Congress have been received, by some of the states, has had an exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive effect on the publick mind. Mankind at large do not always reason: they are prone to imitation, are sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible of injuries, and in their political conduct are generally, governed by their feelings. It was impossible therefore, for the legislature of any one state to trifle with the dignity of the federal government, without, sooner or later, hazarding their own.</p>
            <p>BUT whatever may have been the cause of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick distress, nothing can justify the wild and irrational methods which have been adopted for relief. To every honest patriot it must be highly painful, to see our free constitution, that work of time and of blood, suffering the insults and outrage of the profligate and abandoned. To you, Gentlemen of the society of the Cincinnati, who
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020245_0013_0FAE94AA81BE3290"/>
have been wont to consider the honour and the happiness, the disgrace and the infelicity of your country as your own, it must be humiliating indeed.</p>
            <p>IT has fallen to your lot, Gentlemen, to act a dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, though honourable part in the American revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For eight long years you have trodden together the rugged paths of military life. The return of this anniversary must call up to your recollection the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous interesting scenes through which you have passed, and tend still further to cement those friendships, which have been formed under the pressure of the same distress, and while participating one common danger. On this day it will be natural for you to recur to that period, when the military connection of those men, who, by the united voice of their country, had been recognized as the patriot army, was about to be dissolved. The moment was peculiarly calculated to awaken all the generous affections of the mind, and to excite the finer feelings of friendship and humanity. The idea of bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a final adieu to each other was too painful to be supported; and the most virtuous affections that ever warmed the human heart give birth to your institution. On this day, therefore, you will recollect that friendship, and charity form the great basis of your association. And while you dwell with pleasing satisfaction on the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020245_0014_0FAE94AB813C96E0"/>
connection that now subsists among those, whose pride and glory it is to have defended the same illustrious cause, the memory of those of your brethren, who have sealed their patriotism with their blood will croud upon your sympathetic minds, and call forth fresh tears for their early fate. Hail! Ghosts immortal, of unfading fame! Your names shall grace the poet's verse! The historick page to latest times shall proclaim your worth! While your memory, dear to us your friends, shall be embalm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the bosom of your grateful country!</p>
            <p>By your institution, Gentlemen, it is yours to solace and support, as far as in your power, <hi>such of your unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate companions, as have seen better days, and merited a milder fate.</hi> It is yours to <hi>wipe the tear from the eye of the widow—to succour the fatherless—to rescue the tender female orphan from destruction, and to enable the son to emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the virtues of his father.</hi> Pleasing delightful task! To communicate happiness to others while you increase your own.</p>
            <p>CONSIDERING the temper of the times in which you live, the part you have to act is confessedly difficult. For although, as a society, friendship and benevolence are your great objects, yet, apathy in you, with regard to the publick welfare, would be construed into disaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and uncommon sensibility into design. It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible for men, whose great ambition it has been to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020245_0015_0FAE94AC25670320"/>
the approbation of their fellow citizens, to view with indifference the reproach which has been cast upon your institution. But there is a degree of respect due from every man to himself, as well as to others; and there are situations from which one may not recede, without the unavoidable imputation of weakness, or of guilt. While, therefore, a consciousness of virtuous and lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble views will prompt you to cherish the benevolent principles which first induced you to associate, you will be lead to respect that spirit of jealousy, which always characterises a free government, and, when not carried to excess, is useful in its support. Time, which places every thing in its true light, will convince the world that your institution is founded in virtue, and leads to patriotism.</p>
            <p>BESIDES the motives you have in common with others, to seek the publick welfare—a regard to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of your own character—that sense of honour, which has raised you superiour to every temptation, and to every distress—the reiterated testimonials you have received from your country of their sense of your patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otism and military merit, are ties that must forever bind you most sacredly to her interests.</p>
            <p>PROSECUTE, then, with resolution, what you have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted in sincerity. Make it the great object of your ambition, as you have shone as soldiers, to excel as citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020245_0016_0FAE94AFD6DSC9E8"/>
Treat with just indifference the insinuations which envy may be disposed to throw out against you. Silence the tongue of slander, by the rectitude of your conduct, and the brilliance of your virtues. Suffer not the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed jealousy of individuals, to abate the ardour of your patriotism. As you have fought for liberty, convince the world you know its value. As you have greatly contributed to establish these governments, teach the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious traitor, that you will support them—and as you have particularly fought under the banners of the union, inculcate in your several circles, the necessity of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the unity of the national character. Fortify your minds against that foe to integrity, that bane of repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licanism, an immoderate thirst for popularity.</p>
            <p>SUPPORT the majesty of the laws of your country. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence the publick institutions of religion. Practice the whole circle of private virtues; and disseminate, to the utmost of your power, the seeds of useful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>THUS, approving yourselves to heaven and your own minds, you will do honour to your institution, to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and to your country.</p>
