            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Author of the following Poem, or as perhaps it may be better ſtyled Poetical Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may ſeem to have been rather unhappy in the choice of his ſubject, which being a good deal hiſtorical, did not admit of much poetic dreſs or ornament, nor gave much ſcope to fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or imagination to exert itſelf, that in which the great ſtrength of a poet lies. With reſpect to this he would beg leave to obſerve, that the ſubject was choſen perhaps happily enough, as the foundation of an Exerciſe in an inſtitution under the patronage of gentlemen diſtinguiſhed as friends to Revelation, and on an occaſion when the greater number of them were convened.</p>
            <p>In the ſecond place it may be objected, that an imitation of the poet Milton may be traced through the whole of the performance, though the Author has not been able to attain to any thing
<pb facs="unknown:013172_0003_0F910421577762A0"/>
of the ſpirit of that immortal bard. To this he has only to reply, that an imitation of great originals is placed by Longinus among the ſources of good writing. He therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf free from cenſure on account of any imitation of the poet Milton, which may be ſeen in his performance, though he is ſenſible of his unhappineſs in not having been able to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to any degree of his excellent ſpirit. This however is a misfortune common to him with many honeſt writers, and for which he throws himſelf on the candour of the Public.</p>

                     <p>The author has a principal reference to an infant Seminary at Back-Creek Somerſet County Maryland, where a handſome building is erected, capable of accommodating with the greateſt convenience, near 100 Scholars.</p>
                     <p>This inſtitution, though of few years ſtanding has riſen to conſiderable eminence, and is ſtill carried on with a ſpirit, which does honour to the Province. It is ſituated in a part of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny very diſtant from the Seminaries of reputation to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and near the Bay of Cheſapeak into which many rivers emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty themſelves from Maryland and Virginia on the Weſtern ſhore and afford an eaſy communication. It was very much wanted and is of real ſervice to the advancement of virtue and ſcience in that part of America.</p>
                     <p>It may not perhaps be impertinent to give ſome view of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral plan upon which this School is conducted. A board of Truſtees coſiſting of 15 Gentlemen of the firſt reputation in the county, convene once every three months, or oftener if neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in order to inſpect the ſituation and regulate the affairs of the ſchool. A ſteward is choſen by them who lays in proviſions of the beſt kind and at the loweſt rates, for which he brings in his bill at the expiration of a year: This with the wages of the ſervants and principal Cook is equally aſſeſſed on the ſtudents. From the great plenty and cheapneſs of proviſions in this ſettlement, and the oeconomy of the Truſtees in managing the School, the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of education ſeldom amount to more than £ 18 per annum—Board £ 13—Tuition £ 5.</p>
                     <p>The plan of education is the ſame with that purſued in other ſchools of character, and therefore needs not be mentioned. With reſpect to the internal regulation it may ſuffice to obſerve, that the Bell rings for prayers generally at ſunriſe; for ſtudy at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of half an hour. The remaining part of the day is divided between ſtudy and vacation. In the evening the bell rings for prayers, after which the ſtudents retire to their chambers.</p>
                     <p>The ſchool is placed in a genteel neighbourhood, having in view the dwellings of ſeveral Gentlemen of conſiderable property, who are conſtantly attentive to its wants, and ready to do the ſtudents every good office in their power.</p>
                     <p>It may now be aſked why ſo particular in the account of this inſtitution, and what has it to do with an exerciſe delivered at Naſſau-Hall in the province of New-Jerſey? The author has prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally this to reply, that on reſiding ſome time in the county of Somerſet, he became acquainted with the merit of the ſchool, and thought himſelf under an obligation as a wellwiſher to mankind, to recommend it to the Public.</p>
