            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE knowledge of our good and ſafe Eſtate, deriving from an intereſt in the Everlaſting Love of God, is a thing which every one who hath right thoughts of the Eternity he is going to, will be very ſollicitous about. There is, beſides the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the Spirit of God to this in us, which is neceſſary for our confirmation in the belief of it, the <hi>witneſs</hi> of our own ſpirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite, for our ordinary <hi>Aſſurance</hi> about it, which muſt be given to thoſe things in us which are evidencial of it. Theſe <hi>Evidences</hi> are built upon the diſcovery of ſuch fruits or effects of the love of God wrought in us, as are proper and diſtinguiſhing, and theſe are mainly the Graces of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi>; and theſe are

priority of Gods love to us, as that from which we come to love him, which can be inferred from no other but the <hi>Efficient.</hi> The word is an <hi>Adjective,</hi> and not an <hi>Adverb</hi>; and that alſo puts force into the argument; he was the <hi>first</hi> in this love, and thence it was that our love followed after. Hence,</p>

               <head>DOCTRINE. Our Loving of God is the ginuine effect of his firſt Loving of us. If we love him in time, is it becauſe he firſt loved us from Eternity.</head>
               <p>I ſhall not inſiſt on this <hi>Doctrine</hi> at large, but reſtrain the following Diſcourſe to the reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the following <hi>Caſe, viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>In what reſpect Gods love to us is lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to, and influential of our loving of him?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A.</hi> That we may take up the right meaning of the Caſe, in order to the better reſolution of it: There are theſe two remarks to be made.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>That by Gods love to us, we are to understand his Eternal purpoſe of good will, by which he appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us to Salvation by Chriſt. Love</hi> is improperly attributed to God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in whom there are no <hi>Paſſions</hi> or <hi>Affections,</hi> properly ſo called, inaſmuch as
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000961_0004_0FADE571529F2E70"/>
they argue imperfection, and compoſition in the ſubject of them, which is incompatible with the moſt abſolute firſt Being. But becauſe theſe are in men the Inſtruments of the <hi>Will,</hi> by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry whereof it performs its <hi>Imperate Actions,</hi> or they are the various poſtures of it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to its <hi>Object,</hi> according to the reſentment that it hath of it; hereupon when we ſee ſuch things done in Gods Works of Efficiency, as are wont to be managed by ſuch an <hi>Affection</hi>; we, after our manner of conception, aſcribe it to that <hi>Affection</hi>; becauſe we cannot otherwiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it. Now <hi>love is an Affection in us, which beareth good will to the Object of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and expreſſeth it ſelf in acts of kindneſs to it.</hi> As therefore it is an Humane Affection, it is rooted in the heart or will, and is on all opportunities diſcovering it ſelf in the carriage; and from this conception of it, when God manifeſteth his benignity to the Creature, we conceive him, in his ſo doing, to act as a cauſe by Counſel, and ſo aſcribe it to his <hi>Benevolence,</hi> and call it his <hi>love.</hi> And from this conſideration, there is a divers love that is aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him, according to the different effects of his good will, diſcerned in the fruits of his <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficence</hi> to the Subject of it. There is a <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon love</hi> attributed to him, wherein the good and the bad do promiſcuouſly partake; and it appears in that <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of his which he confers upon them, wherein he gives them large taſts of
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000961_0005_0FADE57454FA21E8"/>
his bounty; and to this love we are pointed in, Pſal. 145.9. <hi>The Lord is good to all and his tender mercies are over all his works.</hi> An<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>Acts</hi> 14.17. <hi>He left not himſelf without witneſs in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful ſeaſons, filling our hearts with food and gladneſs.</hi> And there is an <hi>Eſpecial</hi> love of his that we are told of, which he bears only to ſome, and in compariſon with which others are ſaid to be hated, according to Rom. 9.13 <hi>Jacob have I loved, and Eſau have I hated</hi>; and it appears in thoſe peculiar favours which he hath laid in for, and beſtows upon them; of which we have ſuch obſervations, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son,</hi> &amp;c. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4 9. <hi>In this was the love of God manifeſted towards us, becauſe God ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live through him</hi>; and this is the love that we are now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, and is intended in our <hi>Text</hi>: which, if we run up to the top of it, is nothing elſe but <hi>that good will of his, by which he purpoſed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stow all ſaving good upon us.</hi> There is a <hi>natural</hi> love which we aſcribe to God, by which he loveth himſelf eternally, being his own laſt end: and with this love every Sacred <hi>Perſon</hi> in the undivided <hi>Trinity</hi> love each other; and there is a <hi>voluntary</hi> love which we conceive in him, which muſt needs flow from his good pleaſure; for we are told, Rom. 9.18. <hi>He hath mercy on
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000961_0006_0FADE5752E095EB0"/>
whom he will have mercy.</hi> And ſuch muſt be all the love which he bears to the Creature, ſince its being, and all that he doth to it or for it derive from his holy pleaſure, <hi>Who doth all things according to the Counſel of his will, Eph.</hi> 1.11. And it was this love that procured our Salvation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. <hi>Who loved me, and gave himſelf for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>That by our loving of God we muſt understand, that Cordial reſpect which we have for him, where by we have choſen him for our portion, and are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely devoted to his fear. Love in us, is an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection leading us in purſuit after Union to the object of it, in order to our having intimate Communion with it</hi>: for love is a <hi>Cloſing</hi> Affection, and carrieth us forth after that which we love. That which attracts our love to it, is the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> which we apprehend to be in the object of it, which renders it a thing lovely; the diſcovery of which goodneſs made to the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> moves on the <hi>Judgment,</hi> and by that on the <hi>Heart,</hi> and draws it out after it. Now the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of this love is in <hi>a ſuitable reſpect</hi> that we ſhew to the object of it, and is accordingly diverſifyed, as there is a different reference or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation that we bear to it: the love therefore of Parents to their Children, and of Children to their Parents doth not ſhew it ſelf after the ſame manner. There are therefore theſe two things wherein our real love to God appears,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000961_0007_0FADE575E1B24438"/>
                  <hi>Viz.</hi> In our renouncing of all other things for him, chuſing him alone for our portion, and accordingly depending upon him for all; when we can ſay as the Church, Lam. 3.24. <hi>The Lord is my portion ſaith my Soul, therefore I will hope in him</hi>: And as the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62.5. <hi>My Soul wait thou only upon God, for my expectation is from him</hi> And in our ſubmitting our ſelves with greateſt willingneſs and delight to his Service: Chriſt therefore directs to this as the Evidence of our love <hi>Joh</hi> 14 15. <hi>If ye love me keep my Commandments.</hi> Love is therefore uſed in the Scriptures to expreſs all that <hi>Obedience</hi> which we pay to God, in ſtudying and practiſing uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal conformity to his revealed will. This is rooted in our hearts by the delight we have in his precepts; when we can ſay with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22 <hi>I delight in the Law of God after the inward man.</hi> And it is exerted in our life, when we devote our whole man to New Obedience; <hi>When we love the Lord our God with all our heart, and all our ſoul, and all our mind, Matth.</hi> 22.37.</p>
               <p>It now follows that we proceed to the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Caſe; and we may take it up in the following Propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1 <hi>This love of ours with which we love God, is not barely a</hi> Natural Affection, <hi>or a</hi> Moral Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <hi>in it, but a</hi> Grace of the Spirit. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000961_0008_0FADE5769924E3C0"/>
affection indeed is the Subject of it, in which it is rooted, but we muſt diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the affection it ſelf, and the love which is rooted in it. <hi>Love hath Good for its Object</hi>; and ſuch as the good is, ſo is the love denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated. We love the things that are ſuited to our inclinations: and hence there is in Unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate men, a <hi>Carnal Love</hi> which inclines them to the gratification of their carnal Luſts, and ſo the objects which are ſuited thereto attract their love. There is a <hi>Natural Love</hi> in men to ſuch perſons or things as are agreeable to their natures: and there is a love to the things that are <hi>Morally Good and Honest,</hi> which ſome Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted men have in them, and it proceeds from a principle of Morality, which either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in them notwithſtanding the fall, or hath been acquired by them: but none of theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to the love which we are now in the Conſideration of: There is then a <hi>Divine Love,</hi> which carries men out to God, and to Heavenly things, and fixeth them there: and this flows from a ſpecial gracious principle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into the man by the Spirit of God, and can claim its Original from no other; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called one of the fruits of the Spirit, and is the firſt named, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5 22 <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is love, &amp;c.</hi> This love of God indeed was <hi>Connatural</hi> to man in his ſtate of integrity, being one of thoſe Graces of Sanctification which
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000961_0009_0FADE5775595E4E8"/>
were concreated in him, and belonged to that <hi>Image of God</hi> which was at firſt put upon him, and adorned him. This love was active and vigorous in man before ſuch time as he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved himſelf by Sin; and <hi>none of the Commands were grievous to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Apoſtaſy robbed man of that holy love of God which was at firſt planted in him.</hi> This it did when it ſtript him of the <hi>Image of God,</hi> in which this and all the other Graces of Sanctification were contained. When man put off the Image from him, all that was Spiritual, or <hi>Theologically</hi> good in him went with it: So that every Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate man, if he will ſay the Truth, muſt confeſs of himſelf entirely, as <hi>Paul</hi> doth of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in reſpect to his worſer part, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.18. <hi>In me, that is in my fleſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> there dwells no good thing.</hi> Man, who at firſt loved God as his laſt end and chief good, now ceaſeth to do ſo, and there is not one ſpark of that primitive love left in him. It is ſaid of every natural man, <hi>that the love of the Father is not in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.15. The Affection of love abides in the man, it being eſſential to his Humanity, and inſeparable from it; but it hath ſhifted objects, and exchanged God for the Creature; Unconverted men are ſaid to be <hi>Lovers of pleaſures, more than lovers of God,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. And hereupon that is one title put upon ungodly men, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. <hi>Haters of God.</hi> So

that their firſt love, in reſpect of the object on which it was placed, is turned into hatred.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This love muſt be again recovered by the man, in order to his being made to enjoy God, and to be happy in him.</hi> It is certain that mans true hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſts in his enjoying of God, who is the only adequate object of felicity; no other can make a ſuitable and ſufficient portion for the reaſonable Creature: to be far from God, is to be miſerable indeed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.27. <hi>For lo, all that are far from thee, ſhall periſh: In his favour there is life; his loving kindneſs is better than life it ſelf.</hi> Now God is a portion for none but thoſe that love him: it is by love that we come to have Communion with him, which is our bleſſedneſs, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. <hi>I love them that love me.</hi> Hatred keeps the Sinner at a diſtance from God, and there is a fearful Curſe out againſt all ſuch, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 21.8. <hi>&amp;c. Thine hand ſhall find out all thine Enemies, thy right hand ſhall find out thoſe that hate thee; thou ſhalt make them as a fiery Oven, &amp;c.</hi> Whereas there is a great Bleſſing in ſtore for ſuch as love him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 5.11, 12. <hi>Let them that love thy name, be joyful in thee; for thou Lord, wilt bleſs the righteous, with favour wilt thou compaſs him as a ſhield.</hi> It therefore infinitely concerns us all to ſee that the love of God dwells in us; and this is it which the Apoſtle prays for in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:000961_0011_0FADE57C3ADC1998"/>
their behalf, 2 Theſ 3.5. <hi>The Lord direct your hearts into the Love of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>It utterly exceeds the power of man to recover this Principle, and the activity of it.</hi> Of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural mans inability to exert any truly Gracious action, the Scripture abundantly informs us, Joſh. 24 19. <hi>Ye cannot ſerve God.</hi> Rom. 8.7, 8. <hi>The Carnal mind is Enmity againſt God; for it is not ſubject to the Law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the Fleſh, cannot pleaſe God.</hi> 2 Cor. 3 5. <hi>We are not ſufficient of our ſelves to think any thing, as of our ſelves.</hi> Now this defect ariſeth from the loſs of the Image of God on his Heart, and his incapacity of getting it again by any Endeavour of his own. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath not a root of Grace in him, therefore he cannot act Graciouſly; for <hi>no Effect can exceed the Vertue of its Cauſe</hi>: And becauſe there is a contrary Principle in him, which reigns over every Faculty and Power within him, he therefore is not able to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it. Indeed he cannot ſo much as deſire to Love God, much leſs is he able to reſtore this Grace to his heart again. The Will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as well as the Deed, muſt be of his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration in us, Phil. 2.13. <hi>It is God who worketh in you to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure.</hi> The reſtoring of loſt Grace to fallen man is a work of Omnipotency, and therefore none
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000961_0012_0FADE57D3437A530"/>
but he who is Almighty is able to do it in us: It is therefore compared to a Creation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of the darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, &amp;c.</hi> And to a Reſurrection, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. <hi>You hath he quickned, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> Love is a thing that is not to be purchaſed; <hi>all that a man would offer for it will be deſpiſed, Cant.</hi> 8 7. Which may be interpreted: well of our loving God, as of his loving us.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This love is a ſaving gift, and therefore muſt have God for its Author.</hi> It is one of thoſe things which we are told <hi>do accompany Salvation, Heb.</hi> 6 9. and is therefore called <hi>a fruit of the Spirit,</hi> in the fore-cited, Gal. 5.22. This love is an effect of the New birth, whereof God is the Author, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.7. <hi>Love is of God, and every one that loveth is born of God.</hi> And indeed, it being one of the Graces of Sanctification, it muſt needs proceed from Gods Efficiency, for it is he that <hi>Sanctifieth us,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23. And the wonderful change that is made in the man by it, muſt force us to ſay of it, <hi>behold the finger of God.</hi> To ſee one who the other day deſpiſed God, had no deſire after him, had him to depart from him, choſe carnal objects, lying vanities rather than him; nay, hated his counſels, and was full of all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt him; now to love him, to chuſe him, to embrace him, to forſake all for him,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000961_0013_0FADE57D5E8DC318"/>
to ſubmit to him, and delight in his Service<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is a thing of which no other account can be given, but <hi>that God hath created him a new in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> that he hath given him another and a <hi>New heart,</hi> or otherwiſe it could never have been.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>There was nothing in us that could move God to produce this ſaving quality in us.</hi> In all volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary actions, which are done by a Rational A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, we are wont to enquire after the <hi>Impulſive cauſe</hi> of them, or what it was that moved and engaged him ſo to do: and by ſuch meaſures as theſe are we neceſſitated to conceive of Gods Works of Efficiency: It is a demonſtration of Gods wonderful love to us, that he will put a principle of Sanctification into us, and thereby <hi>reſtores us from death to life,</hi> and whence was it that he ſo did; or what was it that induced him hereunto? Certainly it could not be from any lovelineſs that he ſaw in us, for there was none; we had nothing in us that was deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but every thing was hateful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>Image of God,</hi> which once was our beauty and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was gone; and the <hi>Image of Sin</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which is our ſhame and vileneſs was contracted, and by virtue of it we were every way abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: when therefore God ſpeaks of doing ſuch things for backſlidden <hi>Iſrael,</hi> he would have them to take that humbling remark upon it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.22. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, I do not this

               <p n="7">7. <hi>Hence the ſpring or riſe of all this must be from his love or good will to us.</hi> When we have ſearched into all the cauſes of Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in which this gracious principle is wrought in us, we muſt ultimately determine it hither: we are made to partake in this Grace, becauſe God hath appointed us to it; and the reaſon why we were ſo appointed, was becauſe it ſo pleaſed God; <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 26. <hi>Thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them to babes; even ſo Father, for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight.</hi> God therefore tells <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that he loved them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he loved them; <hi>Deut.</hi> 7.7, 8. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, becauſe ye were more

in number,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but becauſe the Lord loved you:</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timating that the motive of this love was no where to be ſought out of himſelf; and on this account God aſſigns our effectual calling to a love of his own that never had any beginning, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.3. <hi>I have loved thee with an everlasting love, therefore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee</hi>; and needs muſt it be ſo, for he is the firſt cauſe and laſt end of all things, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>ult. Of him, and through him, and to him are all things.</hi> Nor could his Grace be otherwiſe abſolutely free, and ſoveraign, as the Goſpel every where aſſures us that it is.</p>
               <p n="8">8. <hi>All the engagements by which our love is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited to act upon him, are from his firſt loving of us.</hi> As there is the planting of ſaving grace in us, in our Renovation, by which a principle is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into us, enabling and diſpoſing of us to love him, ſo there are the <hi>attractives</hi> by which this principle is drawn forth into act, which are ſo many motives to ſtir up this love in us; for our love of God is not a bruitiſh paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but it is acted with the higheſt reaſon; and all the reaſons of it are found in his love to us: he therefore thus draws us in order to our following of him; <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee,</hi> and the way in which he allures us, is by his love, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 11.4. <hi>I drew thee with the cords of a man, with

the hands of love.</hi> Now there are principally ſuch things as theſe, the conſideration and belief whereof attract the love of our Souls to God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It was this love that appointed us to be the heirs of Salvation.</hi> The Word of God doth fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently expreſs our Salvation under the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of an <hi>Inheritance</hi>; and ſo all the claims that we can make to it, muſt be in way of <hi>Heir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi>: and we are not born heirs to it by a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural birth, but are introduced into it by a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary <hi>Adoption</hi>: we had in our ſelves no more of right to it than the Devils, nor could we make out a better claim to it than the reſt of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtate mankind: we were common heirs with them of the ſame deſtruction, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Being children of wrath by nature even as others.</hi> We therefore come to have a right thereto according to appointment, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. <hi>God hath not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed us to wrath, but to obtain Salvation by Jeſus Christ.</hi> Nor can there be a greater obligation upon us to love God, than the conſideration of this eternal deſign: to think that God had ſuch a thought of good will for us, when he propoſed no ſuch favour for millions as good, and as well deſerving as we; and this is owing to his love, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Behold what manner of love the Fa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther hath beſtowed, upon us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that we ſhould be called the Sons of God?</hi> And ſure this love muſt be more ancient than ours to him, who but the

other day hated him, and were his Enemies.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>This love provided Chriſt to purchaſe Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for us.</hi> Such was our unhappy condition by the Fall, that there could be no ſalvation for us, but by a ſatisfaction made to offended Juſtice, which Attribute muſt not in the leaſt vail its glory in this affair, or ſo much as ſtoop to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in it. If God will ſave us, he muſt provide a <hi>Jeſus</hi> for us, one that can <hi>ſave us from our ſins.</hi> The Law muſt have a reparation made for the violation of it; our contracted Guilt muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated; we cannot do this for our ſelves, <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of rams, and ten thouſand rivers of oyl</hi> will not do it; there muſt a <hi>Surety</hi> interpoſe to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake this, none could do it but the Son of God, he muſt be made <hi>Sin</hi> and a <hi>Curſe</hi> for us, he muſt have <hi>all our Iniquities laid upon him, and by his ſtripes we muſt be healed</hi>: the caſe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to this exigence, either God muſt deſtroy us everlaſtingly for our ſins, or do the execution upon his own Son in our ſtead; nothing elſe would have done: Certainly then here was love unparallel'd: Chriſt himſelf expreſſeth it as that which exceeds all compariſon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> And the Apoſtle thought it to be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which could not be over ſtrained, in the exerciſe of our faith for the obtaining of all the good that is laid up in the promiſe, <hi>Rom</hi> 8.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000961_0018_0FADE58110D22318"/>
32. <hi>He that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him alſo freely give us all things</hi>? and the conſideration of it will be further amplified, by obſerving that this was done for us before we had any love for him: not only was it agreed upon in the eternal compact, that Chriſt ſhould in fulneſs of time come, and work out ſalvation for us, but the thing it ſelf was accompliſhed on our account during our being his enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 10. <hi>God commends his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us. When we were ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies we were reconciled to God, by the death of his Son.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This love hath revealed Chriſt to us as an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſuitable for us to truſt in for ſalvation.</hi> As it exceeded the reach of any created underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to find out the way of ſalvation by Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the thing it ſelf being a myſtery of Infinite wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; ſo the <hi>Revelation</hi> or declaration of him to ſinful men is of God alone. It is his <hi>Goſpel</hi> in which Chriſt is publiſhed; there it is that we are acquainted with his Perſon and Offices, his undertaking and accompliſhment, his Incarnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſubjection to the Law, and making ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to it for us; how acceptable his Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was to his father, how ſufficient it was for us, to procure peace and life for us; there it is that we are acquainted how, and aſſured that <hi>he
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:000961_0019_0FADE5859B0FFE68"/>
is able to ſave all thoſe to the uttermoſt that come unto God by him, Heb.</hi> 7.25. How many nations are there in the world that hear nothing of him, and thereupon they <hi>periſh</hi> unavoidably for <hi>lack of viſion</hi>? Certainly this good news, is a token of Gods good will, it is he who ſends it unto us, and treats with us in it; They that bring theſe glad tidings are his <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>We are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as if God did beſeech you by us.</hi> It is a treaty of peace and reconciliation which is opened hereby to us, but for which we muſt have remained utter ſtrangers unto peace for ever.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>This love hath pointed out to us the way of Salvation by Christ.</hi> As God hath laid it in Chriſt for us, ſo he hath in the Goſpel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the way of it to us. There is a <hi>way</hi> in which Sinful men muſt come to partake in the precious fruits of Chriſt Redemption, and there are <hi>terms</hi> on which theſe are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to us; now God hath opened theſe terms, and laid out all the Articles of the New Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant in his Goſpel. This is not a favour which all partake in: it is ſaid of the Gentiles, who are without the Goſpel, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.17. <hi>The way of peace have they not known.</hi> And we are told in, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>That God hath brought life and immortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> There are the propoſals in the New-Covenant
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000961_0020_0FADE58685246BE8"/>
which muſt be complied withal, by thoſe that hope to be Saved by Chriſt; they that never hear of them, can never comply with them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they believe in him of whom they have not heard.</hi> And it is Gods love to his choſen that moved him to open this Covenant and propoſe the terme of it to them, in order to their being brought into it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This love hath not only provided the means, but alſo renders them effectual to our Salvation.</hi> God brings about the Salvation of his Elect in the way of means, as beſt accommodated to his treating of them as reaſonable Creatures; he hath therefore appointed them in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; and they are the <hi>gifts</hi> of our glorified Saviour, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It is therefore a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favour for men to enjoy them; there is that remark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. <hi>He ſhewed his word unto Jacob, his ſtatutes and his judgments unto Iſrael; he hath not dealt ſo with any nation, &amp;c.</hi> And it muſt be ſo, for the want of them is a note of perdition, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3. <hi>If our Goſpel be hid, it is hid to them that are loſt.</hi> But yet many have them, and they prove occaſions of their greater ruine, becauſe they abuſe them: Herein therefore is Gods love, antecedently to ours eminently celebrated, in that he gives a bleſſing to the means, and ſo making them powerful to advance the end of them, <hi>Rom.</hi>
                  <pb n="24" facs="unknown:000961_0021_0FADE5871AC67E00"/>
1.16. <hi>The Goſpel is the power of God to Salvation, in them that believe</hi>; and why only in ſuch as do believe? why becauſe the Spirit of God comes in with them to ſuch, and leaves ſaving impreſſions by them. Now all theſe are the incentives of our love, and do certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from his loving us firſt.</p>

If Gods firſt loving us be not only a <hi>Reaſon,</hi> but a <hi>Cauſe</hi> too of our loving him; and conſequently if any of us have the love of God produced in him, it is an evidence of that antecedent love which he bare to us; it ſo becomes a diſtinguiſhing note between them whom he loved and others; and for that reaſon it muſt needs be an infallible evidence of Gods having ſuch a love for us before, which muſt needs be from Eternity, becauſe his will and purpoſe is like himſelf <hi>Immutable.</hi> And this can amount to nothing leſs than a <hi>Perſonal
