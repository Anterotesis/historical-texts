            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Call'd to him and bid him ſtay.</l>
               <l>Then Robin took hold of the Biſhop's horse,</l>
               <l>And ty'd him faſt to a tree:</l>
               <l>Then little John ſmil'd his maſter upon,</l>
               <l>For joy of that company,</l>
               <l>Robin took his mantle from his back,</l>
               <l>And ſpread it upon the ground,</l>
               <l>And out of the biſhop's portmanteau he</l>
               <l>Soon took out five hundred pound.</l>

               <l>Thy trade to me tell, and where thou doſt dwell,</l>
               <l>For I like well thy company.</l>
               <l>The butcher he anſwer'd jolly Robin,</l>
               <l>No matter where I do dwell,</l>
               <l>For a butcher I am, and to Nottingham,</l>
               <l>I am going my fleſh to ſell.</l>

               <l>IN Nottingham lives a jolly Tanner,</l>
               <l>With a hey down, down, and a down,</l>
               <l>His name is Arthur a Bland;</l>
               <l>There is never a 'Squire in Nottinghamſhire,</l>
               <l>Dare bid bold Arthur to ſtand.</l>
               <l>With a long pike ſtaff upon his ſhoulder,</l>
               <l>So well he can clear his way;</l>
               <l>By two and by three he makes them to flee,</l>
               <l>For he has no liſt to ſtay,</l>
               <l>As ſoon as he went forth in a ſummer morning</l>
               <l>Into the foreſt of merry Sherwood,</l>
               <l>To view the red deer, that ſport here and there</l>
               <l>He met with bold Robin Hood.</l>

                  <pb n="22" facs="unknown:037827_0021_100F80C418CF5568"/>
As ſoon as bold Robin did him eſpy,</l>
               <l>He thought ſome ſport he might make,</l>
               <l>Therefore out of hand, he bid him to ſtand,</l>
               <l>And thus unto him did ſpeak:</l>
               <l>Why, what art thou, thou baſe fellow,</l>
               <l>That ranges ſo boldly here?</l>
               <l>In ſooth to be ſo brief, thou lookſt like a thief,</l>
               <l>That comes to ſteal the King's deer.</l>
               <l>For I am keeper in this foreſt,</l>
               <l>The King hath put me in truſt:</l>
               <l>To look to his deer that range here and there,</l>
               <l>Therefore now ſlay thee I muſt.</l>
               <l>If thou be'ſt a keeper in this foreſt,</l>
               <l>And hath ſuch great command,</l>
               <l>Yet thou muſt have more partakers in ſtore,</l>
               <l>Before thou makeſt me to ſtand.</l>
               <l>No, I have no more partakers in ſtore,</l>
               <l>Or any that I do need,</l>
               <l>But I have a ſtaff of a ſtrong oak graff,</l>
               <l>I know it will do thy need.</l>
               <l>For thy ſword and thy bow I care not a ſtraw,</l>
               <l>Nor all thy armour to boot;</l>
               <l>If thou getteſt a knock upon thy bare ſcalp,</l>
               <l>Thou canſt as well ſhite as ſhoot.</l>
               <l>Speak cleanly, good fellow, ſaid jolly Robin,</l>
               <l>And give better terms to me,</l>
               <l>Elſe I'll thee correct for thy neglect,</l>
               <l>And make thee more mannerly.</l>

               <l>Then Robin Hood he unbuckled his belt,</l>
               <l>And laid down his bow ſo long,</l>
               <l>He took up a ſtaff of a ſtrong oak graff,</l>
               <l>That was both ſtiff and ſtrong.</l>

I yield to thy weapons, ſaid jolly Robin,</l>
               <l>If thou wilt but yield to mine;</l>
               <l>For I a have a ſtaff of a ſtrong oak graff,</l>
               <l>Not half a foot longer than thine.</l>
               <l>But let me meaſure ſaid jolly Robin,</l>
               <l>Before we begin our fray,</l>
               <l>For I will not have mine longer than thine,</l>
               <l>For that would be counted foul play.</l>

               <l>But Arthur he ſoon recover'd himſelf,</l>

               <l>The tinker had a crab-tree ſtaff,</l>

               <l>What things he was about to do,</l>
               <l>It fell ſo to his lot.</l>
               <l>That while the tinker fell aſleep,</l>

That friend you ſpeak of ſaid the hoſt</l>

               <l>When that firſt he met with you,</l>

               <l>Killing of the king's deer.</l>
               <l>The tinker he then went with ſpeed,</l>
               <l>And made then no delay,</l>
               <l>Till he found out bold Robin Hood,</l>

               <l>To Robin Hood then unknown.</l>
               <l>A herd of deer was in the bond,</l>
               <l>Feeding before his face;</l>
               <l>The beſt of you I'll have at my dinner,</l>
               <l>And in a little ſpace.</l>

               <l>A merry ſong for to ſing;</l>
               <l>Unto me draw near, and you ſhall hear</l>
               <l>How little John went a begging.</l>
               <l>As Robin Hood walk'd the foreſt along,</l>
               <l>And all his yeomen dree;</l>
               <l>Says Robin, ſome of you muſt a begging go,</l>
               <l>And little John it muſt be thee.</l>
               <l>Says John, if I muſt a begging go,</l>
               <l>I will have a Palmer's weed;</l>
               <l>With a ſtaff and coat, and bags of all ſorts,</l>
               <l>The better then ſhall I ſpeed.</l>
               <l>Now little John is a begging gone,</l>
               <l>Seeking for ſome relief;</l>
               <l>But of all the beggars he met on the way,</l>
               <l>Little John he was the chief.</l>
               <l>But as he was walking himſelf alone,</l>
               <l>Four beggars he chanced to ſpy,</l>
               <l>Some deaf, ſome blind, and ſome came behind,</l>
               <l>Says John, here's brave company.</l>
               <l>Good-morrow, ſaid John, my brethren dear,</l>
               <l>Good fortune I had to ſee;</l>
               <l>Which way do you go? pray let me know,</l>
               <l>For I want ſome company.</l>
               <l>Stand thee back thou crooked carl,</l>
               <l>And take that knock on the crown;</l>
               <l>Nay, ſaid little John, I'll not yet begone,</l>
               <l>For a bout I will have with you round.</l>
               <l>John nipp'd the dumb, and made them roar,</l>
               <l>And the blind that could not ſee;</l>
               <l>And he that had been cripple ſeven years,</l>

He made him run faſter than he.</l>
               <l>Then he got out of the beggar's cloak,</l>
               <l>Three hundred pound in gold;</l>
               <l>Good fortune had I, ſaid little John,</l>

               <l>And you begging trade I will give o'er,</l>
