            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>PART I. Containing an Account of the firſt thirty years of her Life, written by herſelf; with a brief In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction.</head>
               <p>MRS. SARAH OSBORN, was born in London, on February 22, 1714. Her father was Mr. Benjamin Haggar. Her mother was Mrs. Suſanna Haggar, whoſe maiden name was Guyſe. She was ſiſter to the Reverend Doctor John Guyſe of London. Mrs. Oſborn came to America, with her mother, in the year 1722, in the ninth year of her age, her father having been here for ſome time before. They lived in Boſton a ſhort time, and then moved to Freetown, on the eaſt ſide of Taunton river, near fifty miles ſouth of Boſton, and above twenty miles from Newport. In the year 1729, they moved to Newport on Rhodeiſland, where ſhe lived till her deceaſe.</p>
               <p>The following is a more particular account of the firſt thirty years of her life, written by herſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:035636_0004_100613DDDFEE1E38"/>HAVING been for ſome years ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to write ſomething of what I can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member of the dealings of God with my ſoul from a child, I now, being about thirty years old, attempt to do it; hoping it may conſiſt with the glory of God, at which I truſt, through grace, I ſincerely aim: And the good of my own ſoul, as a mean to ſtir up gratitude in the moſt ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of all hearts, even mine, to a glorious and compaſſionate Savior, for all his benefits towards ſo vile a monſter in ſin as I am: And for the encouragement of any who may providentially light on theſe lines after my deceaſe, to truſt in the Lord, and never deſpair of mercy, ſince one ſo ſtubborn and rebellious as I have been, has obtained it, through the ſovereign riches of free grace. But Oh, let all tremble at the thought of abuſing a Savior ſo, leſt God ſhould ſay, "Let them alone, they ſhall never enter into my reſt."</p>
               <p>Lord, humble me for my baſe ingratitude; and help me, by affording me the influences and aſſiſtance of thy bleſſed Spirit, that I may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial in this work, declaring the truth, and nothing but the truth; and in all that, have a ſingle eye to thy glory. O, for Jeſus' ſake, ſuffer me not to do any thing that will tend to puff up ſelf. O, remove all ſpiritual pride, and keep me low at the feet of Jeſus. Fill me with adoring and admiring thoughts of thee, O God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, who has ſo wonderfully contrived and wrought out my redemption; and though thou haſt, through infinite wiſdom, hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, yet haſt revealed them unto babes; and even to me, the moſt ignorant and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:035636_0004_100613DDDFEE1E38"/>
vile of all creatures: Whoſe deep rooted enmity againſt thee and thy laws broke out into action, as ſoon as I was capable of any. The firſt that I can remember of actual ſins, of which I was guilty, was <hi>telling a lie.</hi> And then that text of ſcripture often rang in my ears, "All liars ſhall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone."</p>
               <p>I was frequently under the ſtrivings of the Spirit of God, preſſing me to forſake ſin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and perform duties: But ſometimes found them very burden ſome to me; ſuch as praying and ſaying many good things, which I was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently taught. Bleſſed be God for ſuch inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Sometimes I loved them, and was much affected with them: But my corruptions prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dreadfully, an angry temper ſtiring in me; eſpecially when corrected by my mother. But I acknowledge, to the glory of God, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſuch a tenderneſs of conſcience in me, that if at any time my mother convinced me that ſhe did it becauſe it was her duty, and for my ſin againſt God, I could bear it patiently, and willingly, yea thankfully.</p>
               <p>Thus I continued till I was about ſeven or eight years old; when, my father being in New England, my mother put me to a boarding ſchool, about three miles from London, where every thing was delightful to me. I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly taught things that were religious, and they all became ſweet to me, ſo that I verily thought I lived a heaven upon earth. O, how ſweet were Sabbaths! And for ſecret praye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

dreadful thing, that I dare not lie down without it: In this I was doubtleſs governed by a legal ſpirit. I was frequently much enlarged in that duty, and uſed to weep much when confeſſing my ſins, and pleading for the pardon of them, and for an intereſt in Chriſt. The name of Chriſt was ſweet to me, and ſin appeared more hateful. I often uſed to reprove others, when guilty of it. But once in particular, I remember, when I was at Hartford, where my grandmother lived, and my brother with her, a little time before we came to New England, my brother did ſomething which I thought was wicked, and I reproved him ſharply for it; but was much perplexed, after I had done it, with theſe words of ſcripture, "Thou hypocrite, firſt caſt out the beam out of thine own eye; and then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to caſt out the mote out of thy brother's eye." This frighted me exceedingly. I thought I was a vile hypocrite, and ſhould never dare to reprove any body again. And, I ſuppoſe, a hypocrite I was. But at laſt I told my grandmother of it, who encouraged me to go on, telling me i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> was my duty ſo to do; and if I was faithful, God would bleſs me, and love me.</p>
               <p>So I continued for a while, as I thought, to delight in the ways of holineſs. But alas! alas! how ſoon was it over! My goodneſs was like the morning cloud and the early dew, which ſoon paſſeth away; for when I was in my ninth year my father ſent for my mother and me to come to New England to him. And on board the ſhip <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>oſt my good impreſſions, and grew vile, ſo that I could then play upon the Sabbath. But was convinced of that ſin by an accident which

                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> was ordered by infinite wiſdom for that end. Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> as I was buſy in boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething for my amuſement, I fell into the fire with my right hand, and burnt it all over; which I preſently thought came juſtly upon me for playing on the Sabbath day: And I was aſhamed and ſorry I had done ſo.</p>
               <p>But after this I do not remember any partic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular conviction for ſome years; but was change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and inconſtant, ſometimes quite careleſs, and then more diligent in the performance of prayer. I had always, as I thought, a great love for thoſe who I believed were good people, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially miniſters. My very heart would leap with joy, when I could ſee, or come near enough to touch them. I mention this as a childiſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that I took ſuch pleaſure in touching them. I uſed to go ſecretly behind them for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I thought I could do any thing in my power to ſerve them.</p>
               <p>About two years and an half after we came to Boſton, my parents moved to Freetown, and I with them. And when I was about thirteen years old, my mother went from thence to New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port on Rhodeiſland, and went to viſit Mr. Clap, who gave her a little book of ſpiritual ſongs for me, and deſired her to give it to me, and tell me that it came from one who was a hearty well wiſher to my ſoul. Theſe words immediately ſeized me, and filled me with ſhame to think that one whom I never knew ſhould take ſuch care of my precious ſoul, while I was ſo careleſs myſelf. And from that minute I thought I had a grateful love for Mr. Clap <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

longed to ſit under his miniſtry. I was then for ſome time under ſtrong convictions. Had ſuch a ſenſe of the hardneſs of my heart, that I often thought it was impoſſible for me to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently awakened by any ordinary means; and prayed that God would do any thing with me, though ever ſo terrible, ſo that I might be driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en from my evil courſes, and turned to God. Some change I thought muſt be wrought in me, or I ſhould never get to heaven; but after what manner, I knew not. However, I reſolved to perſiſt in the way of duty, as I called it, and to forſake my ſins, and lead a new life. But, fool that I was, I made reſolutions in my own ſtrength, and built upon my own works; and ſo ſoon fell again. O, amazing grace, that God ſhould ſpare ſuch a wretch as me, ſuch an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſer of mercy!</p>
               <p>After this I found myſelf dead, and to have no heart, as I thought, to pray, nor any ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it, when I did. Then, O how I longed for the return of the ſpirit of God, imagining he was withdrawn from me. Sometimes I did ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize in prayer, and plead with God that he would return to me by his Spirit once more. But was often anſwered by theſe words, "My Spirit ſhall not always ſtrive with man." Then I would beg, and promiſe that if God would try me <hi>this once,</hi> I would never grieve or reſiſt his Spirit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. O, wretch that I was! thus to lie to the glorious God, who was then ſtriving with me, to bring me to his Son; for I did, <hi>I did</hi> quench his motions, and ſoon forgot my promiſes. O, deceitful and dreadfully wicked heart! who can

know it? Lord, I am amazed at thy patience that I am out of hell.</p>
               <p>Sometime after this, contrary to my parents' commands, I got into a canoe to paddle about in the river,<note n="*" place="bottom">Their houſe ſtood by Taunton river, which was navigable.</note> and could not get on ſhore again. It being in the night, though the moon ſhined bright, I expected no other but to be drowned. Once I thought to get out, and pull the canoe to the ſhore; but tried firſt if I could reach the bottom with my paddle: And finding I could not, durſt not venture. Then I could ſee no probability of eſcaping death. So I kneeled down and prayed, and all my former convictions revived: And the ſin of diſobedience to my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents eſpecially appeared odious. I thought it was juſt that God ſhould bring me into this diſtreſs for this ſin; and with great vehemence and ſelf abhorrence confeſſed my ſins, with their aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations before God, pleading for an intereſt in the blood of Chriſt, and for pardon for his ſake, for that, and all my other ſins. And while I was praying, I felt a ſecret joy, verily believing that I was forgiven, and that Chriſt had loved me with an everlaſting love, and that I ſhould be happy with him, and longed for the time. I was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately reſigned, as I thought, to the will of God, quite willing to die, and willing to live; begging that God would diſpoſe of me as moſt conſiſted with his glory. And after I had thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned myſelf, as I thought, ſoul and body into the hands of God, to do with me as ſeemed good to him, I was as calm and ſerene in the temper of my mind, as ever in my life.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:035636_0007_100613E355E09600"/>But at length I bethought myſelf, that ſelf preſervation was a great duty, and therefore I ought to try to get on ſhore. So I hollowed as loud as I could to the neighbors, who with much difficulty were made to hear, and came to me, ſome hours after. There was not another canoe within two or three miles; for I had been driven by the tide ſome miles, firſt up and then down the river.</p>
               <p>How it would have been with my ſoul, if God had taken me out of the world at that time, he only knows. Some chriſtians have thought, a ſaving change was then wrought, and that I ſhould have been happy.</p>
               <p>After this, I was more diligent in purſuing, as I thought, the ways of holineſs in the way God had appointed; and more watchful againſt ſin. My life was pleaſant and ſweet. I had great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largements in duties. But at length grew cold again. O ungrateful ſoul! to forget ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable deliverance from death.</p>
               <p>The next winter I was as wonderfully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The weather being exceeding cold, the river was frozen, ſo that people, horſes and teams went over on the ice. But while it was hard and ſlippery, I durſt not venture on it, for fear of falling. But after a great thaw, ſo that the ice looked quite black, I, contrary to my parents' orders again, they being from home, went quite over to the other ſide, which was a mile. But the tide was riſing, ſo I could not get on ſhore: And when I looked round me, I could ſee nothing but great holes, as large as houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, or larger, ſome of them. There was no way for me, but to go ſtraight back again;
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:035636_0007_100613E355E09600"/>
which I did. But the water was almoſt over ſhoes all the way; and the ice, it ſeemed to me, bent every ſtep I took. And when I got back, the water was ſo riſen, that I was much beſet to get on ſhore: And it was in the duſk of the evening. But at laſt, with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, I found a ſtrip of ice, as narrow as a bridge, which reached the ſhore, by which I got to land. But when I had got off, and ſaw the imminent danger to which I had expoſed myſelf, by my folly and preſumption, it made me tremble exceedingly. I preſently thought again, how juſt God would have been, if I had been drowned for my diſobedience to my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; and wondered at his patience in ſparing me: But do not remember, that I felt any a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biding impreſſions; ſo great was my woful ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity: Though I think I kept on praying, &amp;c. As to the river, the wind roſe preſently, and blew very hard from the ſouth, ſo that it, with the tide, broke it up, that before bed time there was not a piece of ice of any bigneſs within ſight of our houſe, which ſtood cloſe by the river. I am amazed, when I conſider how wonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God preſerved me, a poor finful worm, ſo unworthy of the leaſt mercy.</p>
               <p>The next March, we removed to Dighton,<note n="*" place="bottom">A town on the other ſide of Taunton river<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </note> where we lived one year. I remember but one awakening in that time; and that was by hearing of the death of one of my former aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates in Freetown, a young girl, about my age.</p>
               <p>Then I was again aſtoniſhed at the patience of God, in ſparing me alive and out of hell.
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:035636_0008_100613E4E01B8B20"/>
Then I renewed my reſolutions to lead a new life. But inſtead of that, in the ſpring we moved to Rhodeiſland, where I ſoon got into company, and was full of vanity. But my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience would not let me be eaſy.</p>
               <p>After ſome ſore trials and temptations, I was more comfortable, and had a great deſire, I thought, to forſake <hi>all ſin,</hi> and to comply with every commanded duty. I longed to join to the church; but thought I was unworthy. I thought I thirſted for communion with God in the ordinance of the Lord's Supper, and uſed to think, if I came to <hi>that,</hi> it would certainly be a reſtraint upon me, ſo that I ſhould not dare to ſin as others did. And when I ſtayed to ſee the ordinance adminiſtered, I uſed to think I could give all this world, I were fit to attend it. My ſpirit would even ſink within me for the longings I had. Some times I ſhould weep ſo that I could not conceal it. One Sabbath, I went to hear Mr. Clap preach at his own houſe, where I inclined to go conſtantly; but my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents went to the other meeting, and were not pleaſed I ſhould go from them: So I went but ſeldom. But at this time there was a girl of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout fourteen years old baptiſed, which ſo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected me that I could hardly refrain from cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out in the meeting, when I thought how I had broken the covenant engagements, which my parents had made with God, in my behalf, in my infancy, and ſo long abuſed ſo great a privilege, as being a child of the covenant: And ſhe, who had not had ſo much done for her, ſhould now come to deſire it herſelf! I
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:035636_0008_100613E4E01B8B20"/>
ſaw, as I thought, ſuch a beauty in her, that I loved her entirely, and wiſhed to be as good as I thought ſhe was. I made new reſolutions to live anſwerable to the mercies I had received: But being made in my own ſtrength I ſoon fell again. I thought I truſted in God; and uſed frequently, in times of trial, to go and pour out my complaints to him, thinking he was my only ſupport. But I dare not now be poſitive, or really conclude, that I knew what it was to put my truſt in God; for my conduct after this ſeems ſo inconſiſtent with grace, that I dare not ſay I had one ſpark of it then; but rather think I was only under a common work of the Spirit: Though ſome times I think I had true grace, though very weak. God only know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> how it was. O that he would enable me now to give diligence to make my calling and election ſure, that I may not be deceived in a matter of ſo great importance. But to go on. After this (O that with deep humility of ſoul, with ſorrow and ſhame, I could ſpeak of it) I relapſed again, and was full of vanity. I kept company with a young man, ſomething againſt my parents will. But that was owing to falſe reports raiſed of him; for at firſt they liked him. I made reſolutions, that, after I was married, I would lead a new life, flattering myſelf that then I ſhould not have the hinderances which I now had. I uſed bitterly to reflect upon myſelf, when I had given myſelf liberty to be merry; for though I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared outwardly ſo, I had no real pleaſure: But ſtill put off repentance, or an entire breaking off from vanity, till a more convenient ſeaſon; and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:035636_0009_100613E66C43F860"/>
ſo reſiſted the Spirit of God. O Lord, how juſt hadſt thou been, if thou hadſt left me entirely to myſelf! And if thou hadſt, nothing would have been too bad for ſuch a vile wretch as I to have committed. But bleſſed be God, who withheld me from ſuch ſins as would have brought me to open juſtice, and expoſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and family to ſhame and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>In proceſs of time, I was married to Mr. Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel Wheaten, being in my eighteenth year, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober 21, 1731, and went with my huſband, the next winter, to ſee his friends in the country; where I ſtayed almoſt five months; and was almoſt all the time under ſtrong convictions. Oh, how I did ſweat and tremble for fear my convictions ſhould wear off again, and plead with God to ſet home ſtrong convictions, and never, <hi>never</hi> ſuffer them to ceaſe, till they end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a ſound and ſaving converſion; till I knew and was ſure that I had a ſaving intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt, and was freely forgiven for his ſake! And this was the ſubſtance of my frequent prayers ever after, when I could pray at all with earneſtneſs; that I might never reſt more, till I was ſure my peace was made with God.</p>
               <p>From this time I had a hope again, at times, that Ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But then I longed again for the ordinance of the Lord's ſupper, though ſome times ſhocked by that awful text, "He who eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf." But
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:035636_0009_100613E66C43F860"/>
reſolved at laſt, if I lived to get home, I would venture, <hi>in obedience to the commandment of Chriſt</hi>; and throw myſelf into the arms of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. I longed to commemorate the death and ſufferings of a crucified Jeſus. I thought noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould tempt me to delay any longer. But, oh my ſinful ſoul, muſt I yet add to the number of thy backſlidings! Could not the time paſt ſuffice, that thou hadſt provoked a compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate God! Was it not enough, and more than enough, that thou hadſt rebelled ſo long againſt a glorious Chriſt, and grieved his bleſſed Spirit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> But muſt I go on again, after ſuch awakenings as theſe, which one would have thought impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble! But, oh deceitful heart, thou didſt, <hi>thou didſt!</hi> Lord, I bluſh and am aſhamed, when I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber my notorious ingratitude.

               <p>After I came home, I met with much afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in many reſpects. It ſeemed to me that the whole world were in arms againſt me. I thought I was the moſt deſpiſed creature living upon earth. I uſed to pray to God in ſecret to relieve me; but did not, as I ought, ſee his hand in permitting it ſo to be, as a juſt pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment for my vile ſins: And therefore was not humbled under it as I ought; b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I was then with child, and often la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented that I was like to bring a child into ſuch a world of ſorrow: But ſome times found a diſpoſition to dedicate my babe to God, while in

the womb; and did ſo, at all ſeaſons of ſecret prayer. And, after it was born, my huſband being at ſea, I could not reſt till I had ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given it up to God in baptiſm. And I thought that I did indeed give up both myſelf and it to God.</p>
               <p>I met with many trials in my lying in, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an extreme cold ſeaſon. My child was born on Oct. 27, 1732. The next ſpring, my huſband returned home; but went to ſea again, and died abroad in November, 1733. I was then in my twentieth year. The news of my huſband's death came to me on the firſt of the next April. And I was prepared the evening before to receive it, by being uncommonly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed in my mind about ſpiritual things: And that text in Hebrews was continually in my thoughts, "How ſhall we eſcape, if we neglect ſo great ſalvation?" This put me upon plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, that I might not be found among the neglecters of it. I went to bed in a houſe all alone, my child being at my father's. And about eleven or twelve o'clock at night was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waked to hear the heavy tidings. But God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared wonderfully for my ſupport. I ſaw his hand, and was enabled to ſubmit with patience to his will. I daily looked round me, to ſee how <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I had but one to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; and, though poor, yet not involved.

I had then the promiſes of the widow's God to plead, and ſeemed to caſt myſelf more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately upon his care, verily believing, as I thought, he would provide for me, with my fatherleſs babe; for whom I often pleaded for covenant bleſſings, ſince he had been caſt upon God from the womb.</p>

<pb n="20" facs="unknown:035636_0011_100613EBC879F3D0"/>
how I ſhould do. I could ſee no way in which I could get a living. All doors ſeemed to be ſhut. But I verily believed that God would point out a way for me. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, the very day I came to a reſolution to move as ſoon as I could, a ſtranger to my caſe, who kept a ſchool a little way off, came to me, and told me that ſhe only waited for a fair wind to go to Carolina; and, if it would ſuit me, I ſhould have her chamber and ſchollars; which I joyfully accepted. Thus the widow's God remarkably provided for me. This was on Nov. 19, 1734. I was then placed in a family, who diſcovered a great deal of affection for me; and in all reſpects uſed me as tenderly as if I had been a near relation.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed God the next May to lay his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting hand on me, by a ſharp humour, which broke out in my hands, ſo that, for three months, every finger I had was wrapped up in plaſters; and I could help myſelf but very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and was under the doctor's hands. In the fall I was taken with violent fits, and was quite deprived of ſenſe by them five days. I was bliſtered almoſt all over by the doctor; and my hands and arms were all raw, from my fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers' ends, up above my elbows, attended with a h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the ſharp humour continued very violent, at times, for ſome years: And ſtill continues at ſome ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:035636_0011_100613EBC879F3D0"/>
But, in all this time of illneſs, God won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully provided for me. I wanted for none of the comforts of life: Neither was I caſt down; for his mercy held me up.</p>
               <p>The inſtances of the remarkable hand of God in his providence, in ordering my temporal af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, are innumerable. But, oh vile wretch! after all this I grew flack again, and got into a cold, lifeleſs frame. As I grew better in bodily health, my ſoul grew ſick. I daily laid up a ſtock for repentance. But, through rich grace, I was again convinced of my ſtupidity, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be more diligent in attending on the means of grace. But I found I could not prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it by the word preached: Nothing reached my heart; all ſeemed but ſkin deep: And the more I went to meeting, the more I found it ſo. Then I began to think I muſt take ſome other courſe.</p>
               <p>Not long after I went to hear Mr. Clap; who told me the very ſecrets of my heart in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, as plain as I could have told them to him, and indeed more ſo. His ſermon was very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible to me. My ſins, from my cradle, were ranked in order before my eyes, and they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared dreadful. I ſaw the depravity of my na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and how I was expoſed to the infinite juſtice of an angry God. All my former convi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ions were brought to my remembrance. I ſaw how I had ſtifled the motions of the bleſſed Spirit of God, and reſiſted all the kind invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a compaſſionate Saviour. I was heart ſick of all my works. And as it had been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſuggeſted to me, I believe from Satan, that it
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:035636_0012_100613EED629A520"/>
was time enough for me to repent hereafter, it was now ſtrongly impreſſed on my mind, that it was <hi>now</hi> too late for me to find mercy. Once I might have had a Chriſt; but now my day was paſt. And it was ſuggeſted that I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the unpardonable ſin; becauſe I had ſinned againſt light and knowledge, even againſt the convictions of my own conſcience. This I knew I had done; and therefore believed I had committed that ſin which could never be forgiven.</p>
               <p>In this diſtreſs, I went to my Bible; but could find nothing but terror there. My whole attention was turned to ſuch paſſages as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing. "After thy hardneſs and impenitent heart, treaſureſt up wrath to thyſelf againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righteous judgment of God, who will reader to every man according to his deeds. All liars ſhall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone. Depart from me, ye curſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to everlaſting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels. Conſider this, ye that forget God, leſt I tear you in pieces, and there be none to deliver. He that being often reproved, harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his neck, ſhall ſuddenly be deſtroyed, and that without remedy. Ye have ſet at nought my counſel, and would none of my reproof: I alſo will laugh at your calamity, and mock when your fear cometh. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. Who among us can dwell with everlaſting burnings!" All theſe, and many more ſuch terrible paſſages of ſcripture, I found, whenever I opened the Bible. My eyes were open to nothing elſe, and not one
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:035636_0012_100613EED629A520"/>
word of comfort could I find. And if I thought of complying with any commanded duty, I ſeemed to be frowned away by theſe words, What haſt thou to do to take my covenant into thy mouth? Oh, the diſtreſs and anguiſh of ſoul I then felt, neither my tongue nor pen can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, when I was brought to believe there was no mercy for ſuch a monſter in ſin as I was, and expected every moment that hell would open its mouth and ſwallow me up, amazed that God had kept me out ſo long!</p>
               <p>When Satan, and my wicked heart, had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo far as to make me deſpair of the mercy of God, and verily to believe hell would be my portion, I was tempted to try to get the eaſieſt room there; and, to that end, to keep myſelf as ignorant as I could; it being ſuggeſted to my mind, that the ſervant who knew not his Lord's will would be beaten with few ſtripes; while he who knew it, and did it not, would be beaten with many ſtripes: And as my time was over for doing his will, I had better leave off reading, praying or hearing the word preached any more; for I ſhould fare better, if I did. And oh, vile wretch as I was, I yielded in ſome meaſure to the ſubtil adverſary of my ſoul and ſalvation. O, aſtoniſhing grace, that God did not ſtrike me down into hell the very moment I thought to do ſo! God had been juſt if he had done ſo, though I muſt have weltered under the ſcald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drops of his wrath forever and ever.</p>
               <p>But, O! what ſhall I ſay, or how, with grat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itude enough, expreſs the wonderful goodneſs of that God, who preſerved me, even when I
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:035636_0013_100613F146713B20"/>
was, in my own apprehenſion, upon the very brink of hell, weltering in my blood; when no eye pitied me, and no created arm could ſave me: Even then did he ſpread his ſkirt over me, and ſaid to me, Live. After I had been near a week in this diſtreſs, my very ſoul racked with fear of what I muſt undergo to all eternity, thoſe words, "<hi>Depart from me,</hi>" ſounding in my ears, and I uttering the language of hell, "There is no hope! There is no help! The door of mercy is ſhut againſt me forever!" all at once, I was alarmed with theſe thoughts, which ſeemed to be conveyed to my mind in the following words. "Who has told you, that your day of grace is over? Are not the doors of the meeting houſe open? Cannot you hear the offers of ſalvation? Have you not your Bible to read? And you may pray: Therefore, you ſee your external day of grace is not over. And how do you know but you may yet obtain mercy? It is the devil who has ſuggeſted all this to you; and he is a liar from the beginning." I was then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that it was the devil who had been tempting me to deſpair of the mercy of God, which I did not perceive before, but verily thought what he ſuggeſted to me was true, viz. That there was no hope for me.</p>
               <p>During the time of this diſtreſs, which was from Saturday night to the next Saturday night, I ſlept no more than juſt to keep me alive. And when I did ſleep, it was filled with terrors. It was the ſame with my neceſſary food; I thought my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſo unworthy of the leaſt mercy, that I know not how to eat. I found that expreſſion of

Solomon to be true, "The ſpirit of a man will ſuſtain his infirmity; but a wounded ſpirit who can bear?" For ſure I am that no affliction or pain of body whatever, is to be compared with what I then underwent. Oh how terrible muſt it be for thoſe poor ſouls who are on a death bed, to have ſuch hard work to do! I have often thought if I had not been in bodily health, I could not have lived through it. But, bleſſed be God, it was when I was as well in body, as I have been for many years; which has been a comfort to me on all accounts; and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe ſick bed repentance too frequently wears off. But to proceed:</p>
               <p>After I ſaw that I was tempted by Satan to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, and knowing that he was a liar, I began, for a few minutes, to have ſome glimmering of hope that it might poſſibly be, that Chriſt would receive me, becauſe he had ſpared me hitherto, on this ſide the grave, and out of hell. Who knows, thought I, but I may yet be a child of God. Immediately upon theſe thoughts, I was furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly aſſaulted with new temptations by Satan, I believe, not to flatter myſelf with the thought that I ſhould be a child of God; for I was not elected, and therefore could not be ſaved. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, God did not leave his children to be tempted by him, as I had been. I might be ſure, if I was one of God's choſen, he would not have ſuffered me to be tempted ſo; but I belonged to Satan, and he was ſure of me. And I, like a fool, yielded to theſe ſuggeſtions, and at once caſt off my hope again, verily believing it was impoſſible that I could ever be a child of

I thought I could have ſuffered all the torments in the world for an intereſt in Chriſt. If I could have purchaſed him by doing any thing, though ever ſo hard, I ſhould then have thought it nothing.

In this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful agony, I opened my Bible, and the firſt words I caſt my eye upon were theſe: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Theſe words were accompanied with thoſe powerful influences of the ſpirit of God, which excited in me a ſenſe of the excellence, glory and truth of God, and I had a pleaſing confidence and reſt in the divine faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and embraced the promiſes in theſe words.

               <p>O, how was that ſcripture verified, which ſays, "By grace are ye ſaved, through faith; and that not of yourſelves, it is the gift of God."

But I appeared ſo vile in my own eyes, that I knew not how to aſk the privilege of him. But when I came, after ſome uſual queſtions concerning my welfare, he aſked me when I had been to ſee him before. I anſwered, I had not for a long time. Then he aſked me the reaſon of it. I dare not now make any formal excuſes as uſual; but burſt out into tears, and told him, I had been too wicked. He no ſooner perceived what my condition was, but like a tender father to a little child, bid me not grieve, if that was the reaſon; I was wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to him <hi>now:</hi> And he would do all he could to help me forward. And after ſome more converſation, contrary to my expectation, he aſked me if I did not deſire to join to the church? I ſaid, that was indeed part of my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs.
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:035636_0016_100613F6419CDF50"/>
I had met with many hinderances, and particularly that awful text of ſcripture, "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf," had made me afraid to approach the Lord's table. But <hi>now</hi> reſolving, through grace, to rely upon Chriſt alone for aſſiſtance and acceptance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing all my own righteouſneſs, believing it to be a poſitive commanded duty, I dare not omit it once more, if I might be received. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this he told me he ſhould inquire into my character. This I told him I expected; but could tell him more of myſelf, than any could ſay of me, having been, through reſtraining grace, kept from open and ſcandalous ſins. Then he ſaid I had great cauſe to be thankful. He bid me come to him, as often as I had a deſire, if it was morning, noon or night, and I ſhould be always welcome. And he lent me a book, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled, "But they ſeek a better country, even an heavenly." I was ſo delighted with it, that I ſat up all night to read it two or three times over.</p>
               <p>I viſited Mr. Clap very often; and he as often expreſſed his willingneſs to do me good. And once in particular, after he had done ſo, he lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up his hands, giving me his bleſſing, and ſaid, "You ſee I am willing to do you all the good I can; and if ſuch a poor, ſinful creature as I am, is willing to do ſo, think with yourſelf, how much more willing your glorious Lord is to receive you."</p>
               <p>Theſe words having ſo much reaſon in them, filled me with joy unſpeakable. I hardly knew how to get home. I ſaw Chriſt willing, and I,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:035636_0017_100613F9C8C7AA58"/>
through grace, made willing. I could utter no other language but, "Come in, Lord Jeſus, take full poſſeſſion; I will come to thee, thou art mine, and I am thine. Even ſo, Father; for ſo it ſeemed good in thy ſight." I immediately retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when I got home, to give vent to my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. But O, what a rapture was I in, when I renewed my ſolemn engagements to be the Lord's! Enabled, I truſt, by grace, ſincerely to take the Lord Jehovah for my covenant God; the Lord Jeſus to be my Prophet, Prieſt and King; the Holy Ghoſt for my comforter, guide and ſanctifier; the ſcriptures for my rule to walk by: Giving up myſelf, ſoul and body, all my faculties and members, as inſtruments of righteouſneſs. O, how I could ſing of redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing love and free grace! Surely my heart reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth in burning deſires after the bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. O, how was I raviſhed with his love! And when examining myſelf, thrice putting the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to my ſoul, which Chriſt put to Peter, Tell me, O my ſoul, loveſt thou the Lord Jeſus? How did my heart melt, and my eyes ſlow with tears, in appealing to him! Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee. And when inquiring into the cauſe of this love which I felt, and from whence it flowed, it ſtill over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came me more, becauſe I knew I was brought to love him, by the powerful grace of Chriſt, who was before an enemy to him. This cauſed me to loath myſelf, and cry out Lord, what a traitor have I been, and yet thou haſt freely lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me! O, why me, Lord! Why am I not in hell! Why among the living to praiſe the Lord!
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:035636_0017_100613F9C8C7AA58"/>
There can be no other reaſon, but this; where my ſins have abounded, thy grace has much more abounded. O, amazing grace! Haſt thou ſnatched me as a brand out of the burning! O, haſt thou ranſomed my ſoul from deſtruction, and delivered me from my own luſts, and out of the clutches of a cruel tyrant, who had ſo long enſlaved me, and tyranniſed over me in miſery! O, then how ſweet was a Saviour! I could heartily ſubſcribe to thoſe words of ſcripture, "Unto you who believe he is precious. The chief among ten thouſand, altogether lovely."</p>
               <p>Thus I continued from day to day, in ſuch ecſtacies of joy, thirſting for full ſanctification, and more intimate communion with God; daily aſking what I ſhould render to him for all his benefits to ſuch an hell deſerving ſinner; earneſtly begging that God would find out ſome way for me, that I might be made inſtrumental in advancing his kingdom and intereſt in the world. O, how I dreaded being an unprofitable ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant: The employment I ſtill followed ſeemed to encourage me to hope God intended to make uſe of me for the inſtruction of little ones; which cauſed me often to bleſs God for placing me in that calling. And though I know that it every thing I offend, and in all come ſhort of God's glory; ſo that every performance has need of waſhing in the blood of Chriſt; yet it is a comfort to me, to this day, that I was ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by grace to labour with the little ſouls, then committed to my charge; but deſire to be humbled that I did no more.

my eyes, telling me it was impoſſible, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding my great hopes, for me ever to be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He was ſtill ſure of me, and would not let me go. I ſhould ſurely turn back again, and be worſe than ever. It is impoſſible to relate the tenth part of the fiery darts he ſlung at me. But I was compoſed, not in the leaſt daunted; but could prove him a liar in every thing he ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by ſcripture, which flowed into my mind, as though I had learned it all by heart. Never had I ſuch a variety of ſcripture texts at my command in all my life, either before, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſince. There was nothing he could allege againſt me, but if I knew it was true, I immediately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to it; and then flew to the particular properties of the blood of Chriſt, which I found ſufficient for me. Thus I overcame him by the blood of the Lamb; and was left, in the iſſue, filled with the conſolations of the bleſſed Spirit; triumphing over Satan; bleſſing and praiſing God for delivering me out of the hand of this cruel tyrant; adoring the lovely Jeſus. And thus I ſpent the remainder of that night. O, how ſweet was it to me! I longed for more ſtrength to praiſe and love; and even to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, and to be with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Thus I continued for ſome time, rejoicing and reſolving, by aſſiſting grace, to preſs forward, and by all means to make my calling and elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſure. Then I wrote my experience to be communicated to the church; and I was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, February 6, 1737, to partake of that holy ordinance of the Lord's Supper. But it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for me to expreſs the ecſtacy of joy I was
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:035636_0019_100613FD38852590"/>
in, when I ſaw myſelf there, who was by nature a child of wrath, an heir of hell, and by practice a rebel againſt God, a reſiſter of his grace, a piercer of the lovely Jeſus, unworthy of the crumbs that fall; yet, through free grace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to come in, and partake of children's bread. It was indeed ſweet to me to feed by faith on the broken body of my deareſt Lord. Surely it did humble me to the duſt, and filled me with ſelf abhorrence, as I meditated on his ſufferings and death, and knew my ſins to be the procuring cauſe. But when I came to take the cup, and by faith to apply the precious proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the blood of Chriſt to my ſoul, the veil of unbelief ſeemed to drop off, and I was forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cry out, "My Lord, and my God," when I beheld the hole in his ſide, and the prints of the nails. And I could not but, in the words of Peter, appeal to him, Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee." O then I was admitted, with the beloved diſciple, to lean on his breaſt! O, aſtoniſhing grace, and unſpeakable joy, to ſee God reconciled to me, in and through him; and he bidding me welcome to his table! The Holy Spirit, by his powerful influences applied all this for my ſtrong conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. O, what a feaſt is this, when intimate communion with the glorious God is thus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained! When ſtrong covenant engagements with him are renewed; I being aſſured that he was my God, and giving myſelf, body and ſoul, to him forever, and rejoicing in him as my only portion forevermore. Surely, I thought, I could never enough adore the
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:035636_0019_100613FD38852590"/>
lovely Jeſus for appointing ſuch an ordinance as this.</p>
               <p>But I ceaſe to ſay any more of this; for it is impoſſible for me to deſcribe the thouſandth part of what I then felt. O, that I could always live as one who had thus been on the mount with God! The next morning I was as much refreſhed by meditating on the 32d Pſalm, from the firſt verſe, to the end of the 5th. This cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me yet more to adore diſtinguiſhing grace, and even to be ſwallowed up with love to the immaculate Lamb; and reſolve more and more, with full purpoſe of heart to cleave to the Lord. The frequent language of my ſoul was this, "Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none upon earth that I deſire beſide thee."</p>
               <p>I daily renewed my covenant engagements with God: But that they might be more invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably kept, I reſolved to write them. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly began to do it; and went on comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, till I came to write theſe words, "That I would leave, loſe, and deny all that was dear to me, when it ſtood in competition with God, even life itſelf, if he ſhould pleaſe to call for it, rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than to forſake him and his ways." Then Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan beſet me, and furiouſly aſſaulted me. He ſuggeſted to me that I was now lying to God: For I had nothing in me, that would ſtand by me, when an hour of trial ſhould come; but, with the ſtony ground hearers, would fall away. This gave me a dreadful ſhock at firſt, and cauſed me to ſtop a while, to plead with God for a diſcovery of my ſtate: That he would ſearch me and try me, and ſee if there were any
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:035636_0020_1005EDF780809210"/>
wicked way in me: And grant me real and perſevering grace. And in anſwer to my pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions, the following portion of God's word was powerfully ſet home to my heart, "My grace is ſufficient for thee." And then my heart was filled with joy and praiſes, firmly believing he was faithful who had promiſed, and therefore would perform it. So I proceeded to write with more fixed reſolution than before.</p>
               <p>But again Satan with great fury aſſaulted me, and told me, my hope would ſurely periſh; and I ſhould turn back, and be worſe than ever, and brought to ſhame; and ranked in order my ſins of youth. But I immediately opened my Bible, being dreadfully ſhocked with fear leſt it ſhould be ſo. And the firſt lines I caſt my eyes upon were in Iſaiah liv. 4, &amp;c. "Fear not; for thou ſhalt not be aſhamed: Neither be thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, for thou ſhalt not be put to ſhame: For thou ſhalt forget the ſhame of thy youth, and ſhalt not remember the reproach of thy widowhood any more. For thy Maker is thine huſband, the Lord of hoſts is his name, and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Iſrael, the God of the whole earth ſhall he be called. For the Lord hath called thee as a woman forſaken and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſpirit, and a wife of youth, when thou waſt refuſed, ſaith thy God. For a ſmall moment have I forſaken thee; but with great mercies will I gather thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee, for a moment; but with ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kindneſs will I have mercy on thee, ſaith the Lord thy Redeemer. For this is as the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Noah unto me. For as I have ſworn
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:035636_0020_1005EDF780809210"/>
that the waters of Noah ſhould n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For the mountains ſhall depart, and the hills be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but my kindneſs ſhall not depart from thee, neither ſhall the covenant of my peace be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, ſaith the Lord that hath mercy on thee." Theſe gracious promiſes were ſo adapted to ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery particular of my circumſtances, and applied by the Spirit of God, with ſuch great power, that they ſtrengthened me exceedingly.</p>
               <p>But O, when I had finiſhed writing my cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant, which was on the 26th of March, 1737, and came to ſpread it before God, and with prayers and tears to deliver it to him as my own act and deed, it verily ſeemed to me that all the heavens rang with acclamations of joy, that ſuch a prodigal as I was returned to my God and Father. And my joy was ſo great, that my bodily ſtrength failed, and I was, for ſome time, as one whoſe ſoul was ready to break looſe, and wing away into the boſom of my God. O, how welcome a meſſenger would death then have been to me! But my great petition was, that I might with patience wait my appointed time, and glorify God upon earth.</p>
               <p>After I had ſo ſolemnly delivered my ſolemn covenant engagements to God, under hand and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eal, I went on my way rejoicing; this being the language of my ſoul, "Who ſhall ſeparate me from the love of God? Shall tribulation, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? No. I am perſuaded, that neither life, nor death, nor angels, nor princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:035636_0021_10061400A6D50A40"/>
nor powers, nor things preſent, nor thing<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate me from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus my Lord." And I am aſtoniſhed, when I remember the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing condeſcenſion of my God! He granted me near acceſs to the throne of his grace contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually: And in almoſt every thing for which I earneſtly prayed, I was remarkably anſwered; and ſo ſurpriſingly, at ſome times, that I was afraid to think it was ſo.</p>
               <p>Once in particular, in that ſame month of March, as I was aſleep in the bed, early in the morning, I was awaked with the moſt terrible wind that I ever knew. It immediately tore off both my windows, and carried them into the ſtreet. I roſe directly, and looked out. I think I never ſaw the heavens and the water look ſo dreadfully before: And the wind blew exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard, ſo that it appeared that all the veſſels in the harbor would ſoon be broken to pieces. I thought of thoſe poor ſouls who were expoſed to the fury of the ſtorm; and my heart was fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with tender pity and compaſſion for them. I retired, for ſecrecy, into the garret. After I got there, I expected every moment that the roof would be ripped off and blown away. But I was very earneſt with God to abate the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſtorm, and to have compaſſion on the poor ſouls in diſtreſs. And while I continued pleading with God, I had an affecting view and ſenſe of the ſufficiency of one word of Chriſt to do it. It was only for him to ſay, "Peace, be ſtill," and the winds and ſea would immediately obey him.
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:035636_0021_10061400A6D50A40"/>
And after I had ſome time thus wreſtled with God in prayer, I went down. I had been ſo earneſtly engaged, that I had not perceived any abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſtorm; but looking again out of the window in my chamber, I was ſurpriſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove meaſure. The ſea looked as calm and pleaſant to me, as if there had been no ſtorm. I immediately retired again, and returned thanks for it, as a remarkable anſwer of prayer. But have often heard ſince, that it was a piece of pride and preſumption for me to think it ſo. However, this I know, God is both the hearer and anſwerer of prayer, for Jeſus' ſake.</p>
               <p>I could not avoid, when there was opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for it, expreſſing my love and thankfulneſs to God, for ſnatching me as a brand out of the burning: And when I did this once to my mother, with tears of joy running down my cheeks, ſhe ſaid to me, "Ah, child, you will not always find your love thus flaming to the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Jeſus. After a while you will be more cool again." But I haſtily anſwered, too much like Peter, It was impoſſible I could be ſuch a mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter for ingratitude. But ſhe told me, ſhe did not mean that I ſhould in reality love him leſs, but compared the firſt eſpouſals of a ſoul to Chriſt, with that of a huſband and wife, which was generally attended with more fondneſs and joy, than afterwards, though the love might be the ſame, or ſtronger.</p>
               <p>I continued to go on my way rejoicing for ſome time, without knowing what is was to be deſerted one hour together, or entirely to loſe ſenſible communion with God in any duty or
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:035636_0022_100614051EE26710"/>
ſpecial ordinance, or ever to lie down without God; or to awake without ſome ſweet and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing portion of the word of God in my thoughts. My very ſleep was filled with pleaſant thoughts of divine things. Surely I enjoyed ſome foretaſte of heaven at this ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>Theſe were happy days.—But now how ſhall I ſpeak! Oh that I may do it with a heart truly broken for my ſins! After all this, I began to grow more conformed to the world. Things which, when I was thus lively, appeared inſipid, and indeed odious to me, began to grow more tolerable, and by degrees in a meaſure pleaſant. And depraved nature and Satan together plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them thus, "That there was a time for all things; and ſinging and dancing now and then, with a particular friend, was an innocent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion. Who did I ſee, beſides myſelf, ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and ſtrict? Other chriſtians allowed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in ſuch things, who, I had reaſon to think, were far ſuperior to me in grace; eſpecially one with whom I was very intimate. Sure, if it was ſin, ſhe would not allow herſelf in it. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t was for extraordinary chriſtians, ſuch as miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and others who were eminent for piety, to avoid the practice of ſuch things, and not for <hi>me.</hi> Who did I think I was, that I ſhould pretend to outdo other chriſtians? They could talk of worldly things. What ailed me?" Thus the devil and carnal reaſoning argued me out of a great part of my reſolutions for ſtrict godlineſs; and, in ſhort, made me, in a ſort, believe that it was only pride and hypocriſy, and to be ſeen of men, that had ever made me pretend to it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="unknown:035636_0022_100614051EE26710"/>Thus I ſunk by degrees lower and lower, till I had at laſt almoſt loſt all ſenſe of my former experiences. I had only the bare remembrance of them, and they ſeemed like dreams or delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, at ſome times. At others again, I had ſome revivals. I ſtill conſtantly attended the means of grace, and Sabbaths were ſometimes very ſweet to me. At times I had acceſs to the throne of grace, and obtained ſome communion with God, and reſolved to be more circumſpect, and renewed my covenant engagements with God. But I knew I was a dreadful backſlider, and had dealt treacherouſly with God, and ſometimes dare not, with any boldneſs, look up to him; guilt would ſtop my mouth. At other times gracious invitations to backſliders to return, would revive me. Thus I continued, for a great while, ſome times revived, and ſometimes ſunk, and dejected.</p>
               <p>In Sept. 1740, God in mercy ſent his dear ſervant Whitefield here, which in ſome meaſure ſtirred me up. But when Mr. Tennent came ſoon after, it pleaſed God to bleſs his preaching ſo to me, that it rouſed me. But I was all the winter after exerciſed with dreadful doubts and fears about my ſtate. I queſtioned the truth of all I had experienced, and feared I had never yet paſſed through the pangs of the new birth, or ever had one ſpark of grace. And what confirmed this to me, my dear aged paſtor, Mr. Clap, frequently preached, that they who had <hi>real grace,</hi> had <hi>growing grace.</hi> This uſed to make me tremble, becauſe I could not perceive any growth; but thought I rather went back,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:035636_0023_10061409A5D75CD8"/>
and grew worſe. Thus I was covered over with thick clouds for months together. Oh, the dreadful fruits of backſliding! At laſt, I applied to Mr. Clap, and begged of him, that if he knew of any thing which I had left undone, by what I had told him, or wrote for my admiſſion into the church, he would let me know it, that the miſtake might be rectified before it was too late. I was indeed poſſeſſed with the thought, that he ſaw ſo clearly into my ſtate, that he knew I was a hypocrite, though I did not till then. I told him of this. But he ſaid, he never thought ſo; and put me upon renewing covenant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements with God, and giving myſelf up to him <hi>then</hi>; and perhaps I ſhould find I had done ſo before. This I endeavored to do, and did get ſome relief; but was not yet ſatisfied. The tokens of a woful backſlider were upon me. I had forſaken my firſt love, and God juſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted me. Sometimes that text would refreſh me, "Return, ye backſliding children, and I will heal your backſlidings." My heart would anſwer, "Behold I come unto thee; for thou art the Lord my God." And ſometimes that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, "I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions, and as a cloud thy ſins: Return unto me; for I have redeemed thee." But ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> all this time I could not get clear of doubts; but thought ſuch dreadful formality and hypoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy, as I perceived to be in my heart, could not conſiſt with grace. I labored along thus all the winter, unreſolved how the caſe ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and my ſoul: And an uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, dreadful life it was. At ſome times I was
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:035636_0023_10061409A5D75CD8"/>
ſo covered with darkneſs, that I ſeemed to be ſure I had not one ſpark of grace: At other times afraid of ingratitude, afraid to deny what God had done for my ſoul. Oh, theſe were the dreadful fruits of backſliding, and loſing my firſt love! The Lord in mercy preſerve me, that I may never do ſo any more!</p>
               <p>I continued thus till March, 1741. And then it pleaſed God to return Mr. Tennent to us again, and he preached twenty one ſermons here. But while he was here, I was more than ever diſtreſſed. I had loſt the ſenſible manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Chriſt's love. I had no more but a bare remembrance of ſome things, which I had experienced; and yet I was afraid to draw up a concluſion, one way or the other. I applied to Mr. Tennent, and he diſcourſed very ſuitably with me. But ſtill I was not quiet, but exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diſtreſſed.</p>
               <p>I had ſome light and refreſhment under his preaching the next day; but my darkneſs return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again, and I ſunk very low. I was ſo afraid of preſumption, that I dare not conclude my ſtate was good. And he ſtruck directly at thoſe things, for which I had ſo fooliſhly and wickedly pleaded chriſtian example, ſuch as ſinging ſongs, dancing, and fooliſh jeſting, which is not convenient. He ſaid, he would not ſay there was no ſuch thing as a dancing chriſtian, but he had a very mean opinion of ſuch as could bear to ſpend their time ſo, when it is ſo ſhort, and the work for eternity ſo great. Then, and not till then, was I fully convinced what prod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>igal waſters of precious time ſuch things were.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:035636_0024_1006140B318E1C88"/>
And, through grace, I have abhorred them all ever ſince. And to the glory of God be it ſpoken; for it is only from his ſovereign won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful goodneſs to me.</p>
               <p>I am indeed now aſtoniſhed when I think how I myſelf, or any other chriſtian, who has once taſted one moment's ſweet communion with God, can have any reliſh for ſuch vanities as ſinging and dancing, &amp;c. O, how much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is the pleaſure which is to be enjoyed in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of religious duties, than any ſuch thing can afford! Not only ſo; but I am amazed to think how I could poſſibly want ſuch things to paſs away time: For I now find the precious moments fly ſo faſt, and my work ſo great, that I am often hard beſet to know how to ſpend my time as God requires, between the immediate exerciſes of religion, public, private and ſecret, and the calling, in which God has placed me. I know the ſame God, who has bid me hear, and pray, and ſearch the ſcriptures, has bid me work; and both in their place is my duty. And I find it very difficult to yield a uniform obedience; to give to God, what he requires for himſelf, and to the world, what is required as a duty, and no more. Beſides all this, my heart is ſo perverſe, that I have enough to do to watch againſt pride, ſloth, wanderings, formality, hypocriſy, and the temptations of Satan, who is always ready to diſquiet me. All theſe, I find, are employment enough to take up all my time, without thoſe former recreations. If I am cheerful, a ſong of Zion is more ſweet and refreſhing to me, that all the vain ſongs in the world ever were, or can
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:035636_0024_1006140B318E1C88"/>
be. And ſure I am, whatever any may plead, that there is a time for all things, God never yet allowed time for ſin.</p>
               <p>O Lord, humble me for the bad example I have ſet, ſince I called myſelf a Chriſtian; and forbid that any ſhould ever again be able to plead my example for vanity. And oh, that all who name the name of Chriſt, may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to depart from iniquity, and abſtain from all appearance of evil! And if we pretend to be in Chriſt, oh that we may walk even as he walked! For I am perſuaded, that the careleſs walk of profeſſing chriſtians, lulls more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences aſleep, when the devil, and fleſh and blood ſet in to plead their example, than the vices of all the world beſides, who make no profeſſion. And oh, what a dreadful thing for chriſtians to be the means of ruining precious and immortal ſouls, and diminiſhing that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and intereſt, which they ſhould be forever engaged to promote; and promote his kingdom and intereſt, againſt which they ſhould always proclaim open war! Oh dreadful indeed! that Chriſt ſhould be ſo wounded in the houſe of his friends! Lord, make me yet more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, for Jeſus' ſake.—But to proceed—</p>
               <p>I ſtill continued in very dark and melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly circumſtances, between hope and fear, afraid to conclude one way or the other. And having no opportunity to ſpeak with Mr. Tennent again, I wrote to him as well as I could, briefly relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what I had experienced, and begged of him to try it by ſcripture rules, and judge of it accordingly, and give me his opinion; that I
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:035636_0025_1006140CCD9FDE88"/>
might not ſin by denying the grace of God, if I had it; nor ſpeak peace to my ſoul, if God did not. To which he returned the following anſwer.</p>

               <p>I have tranſcribed this letter, that, if Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſhould ever caſt theſe lines into the hands of any in like circumſtances, it may, if the Lord will, have the ſame happy effect on them, as, by

the bleſſing of God, it had on me; which was this—The letter itſelf was exceeding ſweet and refreſhing; but the precious texts of ſcripture, which were quoted, were ſo powerfully ſet home on my mind, that they ſcattered all my clouds im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, and I was as one reſtored from the grave. Then with life and courage I again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed my written covenant engagements with God, and became more lively and zealous for God than ever. O the amazing goodneſs of God to me! I have heard of ſome chriſtians who never recover ſuch backſlidings all their days. But I have not ſince loſt my evidences of grace. Though I have been ſometimes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der deſertion, yet I could frequently ſay, "Why art thou caſt down, O my ſoul, and why art thou diſquieted within me? Hope in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the light of my countenance, and my God."</p>
               <p>After I was thus revived, my longings to be made uſeful in the world returned, and I earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtly pleaded with God that he would not ſuffer me to live any longer an unprofitable ſervant; but would point out ſome way, in which I might be uſeful: And that I might now be as exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary for piety, as I had been for folly. And it pleaſed God ſo to order it, that I had room to hope my petitions were both heard, and in a meaſure anſwered. For ſoon after this a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of young women, who were awakened to a concern for their ſouls, came to me, and deſired my advice and aſſiſtance, and propoſed to join in a ſociety, provided I would take the care of them. To which, I truſt with a ſenſe of my
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:035636_0026_1006140E57DF1198"/>
own unworthineſs, I joyfully conſented. And much ſweetneſs we enjoyed in theſe meetings. (And bleſſed be God, they are yet kept up.)</p>
               <p>About this time it pleaſed God to lay his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting hand upon me by the removal of my on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brother by death. As to the loſs of his perſon, I found I could quietly ſubmit, and ſay, "The Lord gave, and he has taken away, and bleſſed be the name of the Lord." But I had a ſinful curioſity to know how it was with his precious ſoul: And being filled with fear about it, I was very much dejected. But I knew my cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity was ſinful. And I pleaded earneſtly with God, that he would not ſuffer me to attempt to pry into the ſecrets of his will; but give me a quiet ſubmiſſion. I continued wreſtling with God for reſignation to his will, till about two o'clock in the morning, and then I went to bed, ſtill begging that I might never ſpend another day unreſigned. And juſt about break of day I awaked with the following words ſtrongly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on my mind, "Secret things belong un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, but thoſe which are revealed belong unto us. The will of God is done, <hi>the will of God is done.</hi>" Theſe words quieted me, ſo that I aroſe as cheerful, compoſed and thankful, as if I had met with no affliction at all, and I think more ſo; and never did from that hour, nor could mourn as I had done. This I conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered as a remarkable anſwer to prayer.</p>
               <p>After this my buſineſs failed, and I found I could not keep my room where I lived; and which way to turn, I knew not. But was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded God would point out ſome way for me.
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:035636_0026_1006140E57DF1198"/>
I had ſeveral offers to go into the country to keep ſchool in credible families, where I had a proſpect of wanting for nothing of the neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of this life. But I could not bear the thought of going from the means of grace, and other precious privileges, which I then enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And the ſociety of young women often entreated me not to leave them. I had double ties every way, and knew not what to do. But I was not diſtreſſed, believing God would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for me. Accordingly he did ſo; though by an afflictive diſpenſation. It pleaſed him to remove a dear friend by death, with whom I was very intimate. Her huſband was a very ſober good ſort of a man, and wanted me to keep his ſhop for my board, and waſh for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This offer ſuited me very well; for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I was not likely to be deprived of any of my religious privileges. So on the firſt day of July, I went there to live, and indeed had much comfort. Dear Mr. Clap met with the ſociety at his houſe twice every week, which I conſtantly attended; and religion ſeemed to be the chief buſineſs of my life. Had much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in all the duties of religion, public, private, and ſecret: And had as much time to ſpend in them as I could deſire.</p>
               <p>About this time I had the offer of a ſecond marriage, with one who appeared to be a real chriſtian (and I could not think of being une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually yoked with one who was not ſuch.) I took the matter into ſerious conſideration. I foreſaw there were difficulties which I muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably encounter; and many duties would
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:035636_0027_100614122ABB0E70"/>
be incumbent on me, to which I had been a ſtranger: Particularly, in my being a mother in law to three ſons, which my propoſed huſband had by a firſt wife. But after weighing all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as well as I could, in my mind, and earneſt prayer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which God enabled me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in for ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e. I concluded it was the will of God, that I ſhould accept of the offer, and accordingly was married to Mr. Henry Oſborn, on the fifth day of May, 1742.</p>
               <p>The next July after I was married, I went with an intimate friend, to Little Compton, on purpoſe to join in a faſt which was appointed there to implore the outpouring of the Spirit of God on that place; which was attended with much ſolemnity. The next day, which was the 29th day of the month, my friend and I were riding to a private religious meeting, and my horſe ſtumbled and threw me over his head. My ſtomach came firſt to the ground; and yet was comparatively but little hurt; and cloſe by the ſpot where my head came was a large rock, which muſt, in all probability, have ended my days, if I had fallen upon it. This gave me a ſenſe of the goodneſs of God in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving me. I got ſafe to the houſe to which I propoſed to go. And in the evening Mr. Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar preached a ſermon, which greatly affected the people, who were under concern before: But they with much difficulty kept ſilence, till the ſermon and prayer were ended; and then cried out in vehement agonies, lamenting their loſt condition without a Savior, and pleading with God to have mercy on them, and give
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:035636_0027_100614122ABB0E70"/>
them an intereſt in Chriſt. At this time I had an awful ſenſe of the ſtate of the damned, who were crying out under their torments; but paſt remedy.</p>
               <p>Then a number of young women with my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf withdrew into a chamber, in order to form a religious ſociety. Where we ſpent ſome time in praying, reading, converſing and ſinging. At the ſame time a company of young men were engaged in another room in the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes. We happened to ſing in both rooms at the ſame time. The melody was very ſweet, and gave me lively apprehenſions of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous employment, and bleſſed enjoyment of the ſaints in the New Jeruſalem; and filled my ſoul with adoring thoughts of God.</p>
               <p>But in my return to the place where I lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it being late in the night, we were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the moſt awful ſtorm of thunder and lightning that I ever heard or ſaw. During the terrible claps of thunder my horſe ſtood trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling; and as ſoon as they ceaſed, ran with full ſpeed. I was then filled with a greater ſenſe of the awfulneſs and majeſty of a God, than I had ever experienced before; and more realizing thoughts of the ſolemnity of the laſt day. I did not imagine that was the time; but thought it a great reſemblance of it. And I expected every moment to be called to appear before my Judge, either by the thunder and lightning, or a fall from my horſe. This put me upon examining myſelf, to ſee where the foundation of my hope was laid; and whether I had real grace, and a ſure intereſt in Chriſt;
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:035636_0028_10061416488D21F8"/>
that he might then be my advocate. I earneſtly pleaded that this might be my very caſe. Upon ſtrict ſearch, I found ſuch evidences as kept me from all fears of hell. Though I did not then feel the manifeſtations of the love of God, as at ſome other times; yet I found Chriſt was my only refuge. But juſt after the laſt hard clap of thunder, my horſe turning ſuddenly round a corner, threw me off backward. My right temple came firſt to the ground. As I fell, I committed my ſpirit into the hands of my Savior, expecting death: But was wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully preſerved; ſo that I was but little hurt. Thus God ſhewed me, in this day and night of large experience, what he could do <hi>with me,</hi> in a way of judgment; and what <hi>for me,</hi> in a way of mercy, in preſerving me, when in imminent danger of death. Lord, for thine own name's ſake, write a law of gratitude in my heart for this, with all my other mercies. O Lord, what am I, the chief of ſinners, that thou art thus mindful of me!</p>
               <p>Soon after this, we fell into diſagreeable and difficult worldly circumſtances, with reſpect to living and paying the debts we owed. My greateſt concern was with reſpect to the latter, leſt we ſhould not be able to do juſtice, and ſo wrong our creditors, and bring diſhonor on God, and our profeſſion. Under this preſſure and diſtreſs, I was relieved and ſupported by the following words of Scripture, "Let your converſation be without covetouſneſs; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="55" facs="unknown:035636_0028_10061416488D21F8"/>
thee." I lived cheerfully, upon this promiſe, for a conſiderable time. And God ordered things ſo that our creditors were paid to their ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>I have often thought God has ſo ordered it throughout my days hitherto, that I ſhould be in an afflicted, low condition, as to worldly circumſtances, and inclined the hearts of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to relieve me in all my diſtreſſes, on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to ſuppreſs that pride of my nature, which doubtleſs would have been acted out greatly to his diſhonor, had I enjoyed hea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will therefore think it beſt for me; for the tenderneſs of my friends to me, has always had a tendency to humble me greatly, and cauſe me to admire the goodneſs of God to me, that while others were daily complaining, that the rich have many friends; but the poor is deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed by his neighbor, I could never ſay I had not as much love and reſpect ſhewed me, as if I poſſeſſed great riches, and that by the rich, as well as the poor. So that, on the account of my poverty, I never was deſpiſed.<note n="*" place="bottom">Mrs Oſborn appears to have poſſeſſed from her youth, a high taſte for a genteel independent way of living: And conſequently a proportionable averſion to that poverty and dependence which would reduce her to the lower walks of life.

And I will give my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for doing it. The firſt motive, as I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the introduction, was, that I might be excited to praiſe and glorify that God who has wrought ſuch wonders for me.

               <p>I have always reaped much benefit myſelf, by reading the lives and experiences of others. Sometimes they have been bleſſed to convince me of ſin—Sometimes, to ſcatter doubts—And ſometimes to raiſe my affections into a flame. When expreſſions have been warm, they have put me upon imitating them as well as I could, by breathing out my ſoul in like manner. And though I fall ever ſo ſhort of the excellencies with which others have been endowed; yet I know all things are poſſible with God.

And if it does not conſiſt with that, to have theſe lines ſeen by any, either before or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my deceaſe, I heartily deſire, ſo far as I can poſſibly fathom that unfathomable deep, my own deceitful heart, and know it, that they may be all buried in oblivion. Surely, I had rather my name, and all belonging to me, ſhould be forgotten among men, than remembered to the diſhonor of my God. I am an ignorant ſhort-fighted creature: But God knows what will be for the beſt. To him I commit it, praying that, in his all wiſe providence, it may be diſpoſed of as he ſees meet.</p>

               <p>THE parents of Mrs. Oſborn were never in affluent worldly circumſtances; and had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle or nothing to give to her when ſhe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: And perhaps did not give her all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which they were able to do, as they were not pleaſed with her marrying to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom ſhe choſe. He was young, and uſed the ſea, and had nothing beforehand, and died in the ſecond voyage after he was married, and ſhe was left a poor widow with one young child before ſhe was twenty years old. She contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a widow more than eight years. In which time ſhe did no more than juſt ſupport herſelf and ſon, by her induſtry, in keeping a ſmall ſchool part of the time; which buſineſs ſhe was, at length, obliged to relinquiſh, by ſickneſs, in which ſhe needed and had the aſſiſtance of ſome of her kind friends. Thus ſhe continued a poor widow, till ſhe married the ſeccond time, in the twenty ninth year of her age.</p>
               <p>Her ſecond huſband was in ſome trade and buſineſs when ſhe married him; but ſoon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to owe to his creditors more than he was able to pay. They gave up all they had and their creditors were paid, ſo that they wer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

all made eaſy, and gave them a diſcharge. From that time he did but little or no buſineſs, by reaſon of bodily diſorders, and other infirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities. At the ſame time he had children who were poor, and wanted aſſiſtance. In theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, Mrs. Oſborn began to keep ſchool again in May, 1744. In which buſineſs ſhe continued about thirty years, till her eyeſight and bodily ſtrength failed, ſo that ſhe was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to give it up. She was, during this whole time, attended with bodily weakneſs, pains and infirmities; her conſtitution being greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured by taking mercury in an improper man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and degree, which was preſcribed by her phyſician when afflicted with the diſtreſſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, which ſhe mentions in the account ſhe has given of her life, the weakening and painful effects of which attended her to the day of her death. Under theſe diſorders, which were at times very diſtreſſing, ſhe perſevered in her bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which in her circumſtances required a diligence, circumſpection and reſolution, which have been equalled by few or none, until ſhe loſt her ſight and ſtrength, to ſuch a degree as obliged her to deſiſt.</p>
               <p>For this ſpace of about thirty years ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in a ſchool, which was moſt of the time ſo large that ſhe was obliged to employ aſſiſtants. The whole number of children in her ſchool a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted ſometimes to ſeventy or more, ſome of whom, at times eight or ten, ſhe boarded.</p>

ſchooling and boarding being low, ſhe, through this whole time, was not able to lay up any thing; but was reduced to great ſtraits and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties; and at the end of the year ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently found herſelf in the rear, rather than to have gained any overplus or ſtock for the next; this kept her in a conſtant ſtate of peculiar trial, and temptation to worldly ſolicitude and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which required an uncommon degree of faith and piety to ſurmount. And ſometimes, under the darkeſt appearances, her faith would ſo far fail that ſhe would ſink into gloom and dejection, eſpecially in the former part of this time. But ſhe evidently made advances in her faith and cheerful reſignation to the divine will, and happy contentment with the allotments of Divine Providence, while her trials and worldly ſtraits, continued as great as ever: So that ſhe appeared, at length, to have got the victory over the world to an uncommon degree, and to have enjoyed a calm, ſweet reſignation and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in her worldly circumſtances, which was the ſource of high religious enjoyment, in the conſtant and ſtrong exerciſe of that piety, by which ſhe enjoyed God as her only and eternal portion. This appears from her diary; and was eſpecially manifeſt to her intimate friends, after ſhe was obliged to give up all buſineſs, and was wholly dependent on her friends for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; of which a more particular account may be given, before theſe memoirs are finiſhed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Oſborn began to keep ſchool the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond time, as has been obſerved, in the month of May, 1744, in the thirty firſt year of her age.

With reſpect to which ſome things are noted in her diary, which may be properly tranſcribed here.</p>
               <p>"<hi>Saturday April</hi> 28, 1744.—This day I am determined, if the Lord will, to enter again into the calling of keeping ſchool. Will the Lord in mercy bleſs my endeavors, and proſper the work of my hands, and overrule this for his own glory, by making me inſtrumental in promoting the good of ſouls. O Lord, if thou wilt again employ me, and make me faithful, my tongue ſhall ſing aloud of thy righteouſneſs. Oh, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me from making dependence on any thing I can do, either for ſoul or body: But if it may conſiſt with thy will, O bleſs me in this lawful undertaking. But above all, O Lord, go on to reſign me to thy will. Not mine, but thine be done. Lord, I deſire to leave it with thee. O undertake for me, and deal graciouſly with me, for thine own ſake, as thou uſeſt to do to thoſe who love thy name. Help me to eye thee in all thy diſpenſations of providence, and be thankful to thee for every temporal mercy. Dear Lord, order it ſo that thine own honor may be ſecured, and thou mayeſt be glorified in me, and it is enough. Once more, I beg to be reſigned, and to take all things well at thy dear hand. Whether thou ſmile or frown, let me bleſs and love; for this is my duty, and what thou juſtly expecteſt of me. Lord, thou art worthy of infinitely more love and praiſe than I am capable of giving: But oh, accept my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to love and praiſe, for Jeſus' ſake alone.
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:035636_0032_1006141F35EE1760"/>
In his name I come to thee for all bleſſings, ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itual and temporal.</p>
               <p>"<hi>Friday morning, May</hi> 4.—At this time much ſtraitened in myſelf to know if it is my duty to pray evening and morning in my ſchool, if the Lord bleſs me with one. I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid of oſtentation, afraid of doing any thing to be ſeen of men. I am afraid of neglecting it, on account of what others will ſay or think, leſt that ſhould be being aſhamed of Chriſt and his ways, in this wicked generation; and yet, I am afraid of bringing religion into contempt. O Lord, direct me to do, in this caſe, as will moſt conſiſt with thy glory. For I beſeech thee, dear Lord, that thou wilt not ſuffer me to enter into this calling, except thou wilt be with me, and bleſs me in it. Oh, make me inſtrumental of the good of their ſouls committed to my charge, as well as faithful to their parents in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing them. And if it be thy will that I pray with them, as well as for them, oh ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me and encourage my heart. Lord, pour out on me a ſpirit of prayer and ſupplication, that I may aſk for things agreeable to thy bleſſed will. O Lord, I leave this caſe with thee. I beg thou wilt direct me, and ſuffer nothing but pure aims at thy glory, and the good of ſouls, to be the governing principle in me. Lord, I am afraid of the reaſonings of my own deceitful heart. It eaſily impoſes upon, and deceives me. But, bleſſed be thy name, it cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive thee. O, do thou ſearch it and try it, and diſcover to me more of its vileneſs, that I may never be a fool, truſting to it. Lord, it is
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:035636_0032_1006141F35EE1760"/>
thine: Oh mould it into thine own likeneſs, fill it with thy grace, and poſſeſs it forever.</p>
               <p>"<hi>Thurſday May</hi> 10.—I deſire to record it with thankfulneſs, that God in his providence gave me an opportunity laſt evening to adviſe with my dear aged paſtor (Mr. Clap) about praying with my ſcholars. He rejoiced much in the propoſal; and adviſed me, by all means to proceed, and let nothing diſcourage me, and fear no ſcoffs; for it was God's cauſe, and he who put it into my heart to do it, would take care of his own glory. He likewiſe reminded me how highly Chriſt reſented it, when his own diſciples would have deprived little children of privileges. He adviſed me to be brief and plain, and often to mention thoſe words in Matth. vi. "Aſk, and ye ſhall receive; ſeek, and ye ſhall find; knock, and it ſhall be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto you." And thoſe in Prov. "I love them that love me, and thoſe that ſeek me early ſhall find me." And to make confeſſion of ſin, and plead for pardon for Chriſt's ſake.—En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to follow him in plainneſs, ſo that the little ones might underſtand what I meant, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>"As I think I never ſaw him more joyful, and pleaſed with me, ſo I know not when I have come away more comforted: For my ſcruples all vaniſhed. And now, by aſſiſting grace, I determine to proceed, as God ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me. Bleſſed be God, that I enjoy ſo great a privilege as my dear paſtor, who has thus en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged my faith, obedience and joy; and helped me in my ſtrait. And now, O my God, I am convinced it is my duty to pray with my dear
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:035636_0033_1006142296447080"/>
children, I fly to thee again for aſſiſting grace. Lord, without that it will be only a piece of formality, and will never prove ſerviceable to any. I beſeech thee, O Lord, pour out on me a ſpirit of prayer, and fill me with bowels of compaſſion to poor little ones."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Oſborn not only prayed daily with the children in her ſchool; but was conſtant and careful to inſtruct them in the principles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and in their duty to God and man; and at certain times, and on particular occaſions, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly addreſſed them on the concerns of their ſouls, urging their attention to the Bible, to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and the way of ſalvation by him; and to give themſelves up to him, to fear and ſerve him, &amp;c. Her diſcourſes with them on theſe ſubjects frequently appeared to make im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions on their minds, and greatly to affect them: And moſt of the many hundreds who were inſtructed in her ſchool, retained a love and eſteem for her in the future part of their life, and numbers of them, how many cannot be now known, have never loſt the ſerious impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, which they received by her inſtruction and admonitions; but they have iſſued in their ſaving converſion to God. And we may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably conſider ſome of them now in heaven with her, as her glory, and joining with her in mutual joy.</p>
               <p>She compoſed and committed to writing a number of particular directions and rules for the children in her ſchool, pointing out the decent and proper manner of their behavior towards her, and each other in ſchool, and when going
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:035636_0033_1006142296447080"/>
away and returning; at home and abroad; when in the houſe and by the way; and their manner of ſpeech and behavior towards all with whom they had any connection and concern; which rules were to be often read in ſchool. Theſe rules diſcovered her good judgment and taſte, reſpecting the propriety and decency of conduct of children in all ſituations, and towards ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, equals and inferiors, in age and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. They might be very uſeful to teachers of ſchools and to their pupils, were they tranſcribed; and were they not too lengthy to be inſerted here.</p>
               <p>A FEW months after Mrs. Oſborn began to keep ſchool the ſecond time, her only ſon, Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel Wheaten, died, being near twelve years old, who was an apprentice in the country above twenty miles from Newport, and was a promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing youth. She has recorded ſome of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes under this trial, part of which will be here inſerted.</p>
               <p>"<hi>Friday morning, September</hi> 22, 1744.—On Thurſday afternoon, the ſixth day of this month, I had the ſorrowful news that my only ſon was ſick unto death. God in his providence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided preſently for me—My dear Suſa Antho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to keep my houſe—A horſe for my huſband and myſelf to ride, and all other things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable. And on my way God gave me ſuch
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:035636_0034_10061424359A4E28"/>
a ſenſe of his goodneſs to me in a thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that inſtead of ſinking under my ſorrow, my mind was employed in attention to, and bleſſing God for my mercies. Sometimes, that he was not ſnatched from me in a moment, by ſome awful accident—That he was not at ſo great a diſtance, but I might be allowed to go to him, with hopes of finding him yet alive<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And thoſe precious promiſes which in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had ſupported me, ſtill continued as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing cordial; even theſe. "Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will hear thee. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him; and ſaved him out of all his troubles."</p>
               <p>"On Friday morning we got to Rehoboth<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> where I found my ſon much ſwelled with a dropſy, and pined to a mere ſkeleton with the jaundice, ſcurvy and conſumption, all combin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He rattled in his throat, like a dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, laboring for every breath. He was given over by the doctors and all friends, who lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and did the beſt for him in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as to the body. But alas! my great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern was for that precious jewel, his immortal ſoul. I endeavored to improve every opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to diſcourſe with him, and read to him ſuch portions of ſcripture as I thought ſuitable, with paſſages out of Mr. Allen's Alarm, &amp;c. And I was enabled to pray all the day, by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jaculatory breathings, and ſometimes to plead and wreſtle with God on his behalf: Though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las! God was pleaſed to hide his dealings with him altogether. For I could diſcern no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a work of grace wrought on his ſoul<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:035636_0034_10061424359A4E28"/>
for which I did plead from day to day. I did not ſo much as once, in all his ſickneſs, pray for his life; but for ſome evidence that his ſoul might live. And for want of this, I ſometimes ſeemed to be cruſhed down, having a ſenſe of his doleful caſe, if not reconciled to God. On Thurſday, Sept. 13, the day before he died, I was juſt ready to give up, and ſit down diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged. My heart even almoſt died with fear of what would become of him. But juſt in this juncture, God in his providence ordered it ſo that I received a letter from my dear S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſa, which was a cordial to my drooping ſpirits.</p>
               <p>"In his dying moments I had an awful ſenſe of his deplorable condition, if his naked ſoul ſhould launch into a boundleſs eternity, without a God to go to. I had alſo a view and ſenſe of his and my utter inability to help ourſelves, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unworthineſs that God ſhould help us. And with the woman of Canaan, I cried out, Truth Lord, I am as unworthy as a dog! But I pleaded for the crumbs that fell, one of which would be ſufficient for me and mine. I had a clear diſcovery of the fulneſs and ſufficiency of Chriſt to make ſatisfaction. I pleaded that he would have mercy, as on the theif on the croſs, then at the eleventh hour; apply but one drop of his precious blood, and it was enough. Thus I was enabled to fill my mouth with arguments, and in bitter agony of ſoul I wreſtled with God for mercy for him. Surely the pangs I then endured for his foul far exceeded thoſe that brought him into the world. But as ſoon as the ſoul had taken its flight, I was eaſed of my
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:035636_0035_10061425ED2E2D68"/>
burden. I immediately caſt myſelf, and my burden too, on God. I adored him as a ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign God, and bleſſed his name; for he had given, and it was he who had taken. Surely he was better to me than ten ſons.</p>
               <p>"I then aroſe from my dead child, and was quieted, for the will of God was done, and my work was done, as it reſpected my child. And God was pleaſed to give ſuch evidence of his love, that my mouth was filled with praiſes. But when I looked on the young people who ſtood round lamenting him, I felt bowels of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for them, and beſought them to take warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and make their ſpeedy flight to the bleſſed Jeſus, before ſickneſs and death overtook them.</p>
               <p>"While friends were putting on his grave clothes, I went out into the field and walked, where, with more ſecrecy and freedom, I could breathe out my ſoul to God. And the ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that ſeaſon I cannot expreſs. God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf to be my God, my covenant God, my Father, my Friend, my only portion and happineſs, my ſovereign, my all in all, my infinite fountain of all fulneſs. And theſe were ſome of the breathings of my ſoul after him. "Lord, I adore thee as my all. I rejoice in thee as my only portion. Lord, if I have thee, I have enough. Though all the ſtreams were cut off; yet the fountain remains; I cannot be poor. Whom have I in heaven but thee? And there is none on earth I deſire beſides thee. Though my fleſh and my heart fail; yet God is the ſtrength of my heart and my portion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. Bleſſed God, though death ſeparate from
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:035636_0035_10061425ED2E2D68"/>
all things here below, it cannot ſeparate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween thee and me." O, here I rejoiced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, choſe my God again, and again renewed the dedication of myſelf to him, my whole ſoul and body, with all I have, am, or can do. O, his word comforted, his <hi>rod</hi> comforted me. I ſaw no frown in it: No, but the kind chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my indulgent Father. This portion of ſcripture was very ſweet, "If ye be without chaſtiſement, whereof all are partakers, then are ye baſtards, and not ſons. For whom the Lord loveth, he chaſteneth." Therefore I cried out, "I know, O Lord, thy judgments are right, and in very faithfulneſs thou haſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted me."</p>
               <p>"But I muſt ceaſe.—For ſuch bleſſed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are better felt than expreſſed. I contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued ſo compoſed and comfortable, that I feared thoſe who knew not the cauſe would think me void of natural affection; till my tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my laſt farewell at his funeral. And then I found the bonds of natural affection very ſtrong; and I wept much. But as I followed to the grave, I pleaded thus with God, "Lord, I adore thee ſtill as my ſovereign. I do not repine at thy hand. But, dear Lord, pity me, and ſuffer me to weep under the ſmart of thy rod; it is my <hi>only ſon.</hi>" Then I thought on Pſalm ciii. "As a father pitieth his children, ſo the Lord pitieth them that fear him." This comforted me. But as I inquired again, if my tears were not ſinful, and the effect of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſigned will, which I dreaded moſt of all, I was comforted again by reflecting, that when
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:035636_0036_100614277B28AB28"/>
Martha and Mary wept for their brother Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, the bleſſed Jeſus was not angry, but wept with them. O, then I again adored a ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſing Savior, a glorious high prieſt, who was ſenſibly touched with the feeling of my infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Theſe and ſuch like were the exerciſes of my mind, while following and laying my duſt into the grave. And ever ſince I have been kept compoſed and cheerful.</p>
               <p>"The Lord in mercy grant that I may more and more glorify him in this affliction. O that my ſins may be more mortified. Lord, grant I may come out of this furnace as gold puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and fitted for my maſter's uſe. If I have behaved in any meaſure as becomes a child of God, and any reſignation has appeared in me, Lord, it is all owing to the riches of thy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and ſpecial grace: For hadſt not thou by that compelled me to act otherwiſe, I ſhould have flew in thy face, murmured, fretted and repined at thee; caſt away all my other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and mercies, and ſaid I had none left, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thou hadſt taken <hi>one</hi> from me. Lord, theſe, and more than theſe, would have been the effects of my perverſe nature. Therefore, not unto me, not unto <hi>me</hi>; but to thy glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous name be all the glory forever and ever. Amen."</p>
               <p>IN the year 1741, a religious, female ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety was formed under the care of Mrs. Oſborn,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:035636_0036_100614277B28AB28"/>
they having choſen her to be their head. Of which ſhe makes mention in her account of her own life, which has been tranſcribed, page 49. This ſociety met for ſome time twice ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery week, viz. on Tueſday and Friday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Afterwards they agreed to meet but once a week, on the afternoon of Wedneſday or Thurſday. Mrs. Oſborn was continued and conſidered the head of this ſociety from that time to her deceaſe, which was above fifty years; and it ſtill ſubſiſts, and there are above thirty members of it who are now living. It has conſiſted of a much greater number of members. About thirty years ago, above ſixty perſons were members of it. But the war, and other evils which have ſince that time taken place, have diminiſhed it.</p>
               <p>This ſociety have met conſtantly once every week, during this whole time of above half a century, excepting a few interruptions, by ſome extraordinary occurrences. They alſo have obſerved four whole quarterly days in every year, as days of faſting and prayer, confeſſing their ſins, and ſeeking God for ſpiritual bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings on themſelves, on the church of Chriſt, and on all nations. They alſo have been wont to ſpend the afternoon of every firſt Thurſday of each month in prayer together; and the afternoon of every Saturday before the monthly adminiſtration of the Lord's Supper. They have a box, which ſtands in the room where they meet, into which money is put by each one, as ſhe is able and inclined. And at the end of the year, or any other time, when they
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:035636_0037_1006142B1A593188"/>
think proper, the box is by their conſent open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the money contained in it counted, and generally given for the ſupport of the goſpel.</p>
               <p>They did agree upon a number of articles and rules, which were committed to writing, to be obſerved by the ſociety and by each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, and to be ſigned by every member, and by every one who ſhould afterwards be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. The ſubſtance of theſe is as follows:</p>
               <p>At the weekly meeting of the ſociety, when the appointed hour arrives, and a number are convened, the exerciſe ſhall begin by reading in ſome profitable book, till all have come in who are expected. Then a prayer ſhall be made by one of the members; and after that, a chapter in the Bible ſhall be read, and relig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious converſation be attended to, as time ſhall allow. The meeting to be concluded by an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other prayer. Four quarterly days in the year, in January, April, July and October, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning on the firſt day of every January, to be obſerved as days of ſolemn faſting and prayer. We promiſe not to ridicule or divulge the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed or apparent infirmities, of any fellow member; but to keep ſecret all things relating to the ſociety, the diſcovery of which might tend to do hurt to the ſociety or any individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. We reſolve to be charitably watchful over each other, to adviſe, caution and admoniſh, where we judge there is occaſion, and that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> may be uſeful. And we promiſe not to reſent; but kindly and thankfully receive ſuch friendly advice or reproof from any one of our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. We will endeavor that our diſcourſe
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:035636_0037_1006142B1A593188"/>
while together ſhall be on the ſerious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſubjects of religion: And when ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that our ſpeech and behavior ſhall be ſuch as become chriſtians, that we may be holy in all converſation.</p>
               <p>If any member commit any ſcandalous ſin, or walk unruly, and after proper reproof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue manifeſtly impenitent, ſhe ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from us, until ſhe give evidence of her repentance. Each one ſhall pay her propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to defray the neceſſary expenſes for wood, or any thing elſe, unleſs excuſed by the ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety.</p>
               <p>When any perſon ſhall manifeſt to any one of us a deſire to join the ſociety, it ſhall be mentioned in one of our meetings, that all may have opportunity, who deſire it, to ſatisfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, reſpecting the character and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſon offering to join. And if at the meeting on the next week, there be no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to her being admitted, ſhe may apply to the head of the ſociety, who will read our arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to her, and if ſhe is willing, and do ſign them, ſhe ſhall be conſidered as a member of the ſociety, regularly admitted.</p>
               <p>As to any other matters, which we ſhall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after find conducive to the benefit and good regulation of our ſociety, we engage to leave to the diſcretion and deciſion of a major part of us, to whoſe determination we promiſe quietly to agree and ſubmit.</p>
               <p>This ſociety has evidently been of great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to many if not all the members of it, to the church and congregation to which moſt
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:035636_0038_1006142DA8F89DF0"/>
of the members have belonged, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of religion in general, eſpecially in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, by their prayers, and apparent ſincerity and engagedneſs in religion, and exemplary conduct.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Oſborn was by unanimous conſent the head of this ſociety above fifty years, as has been obſerved, even from the firſt inſtitution of it, to the day of her death; and a great part of the time their meetings were attended at her houſe. And ſhe was diſtinguiſhed in her uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs in this ſtation and capacity, by her prayers, her converſation, advice, judgment, prudence and example; by which ſhe was a principal medium of the long and happy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence and union of the ſociety. Her influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence apparently reached to every member, and her ſteady, prudent zeal and activity, and her amiable character, were very much the means of their continuance and edification. The ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety continued to meet in the room in which ſhe lived, till her bodily infirmities were ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed that ſhe was no longer able to ſuſtain their company, and the exerciſes of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They then withdrew into another room in her houſe, where ſhe was tenderly remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered in their prayers; and ſhe was preſent in ſpirit with them, and partook largely with them in their exerciſes and enjoyments.</p>
               <p>MRS. OSBORN was eſteemed as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently pious, exemplary chriſtian, by all who
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:035636_0038_1006142DA8F89DF0"/>
knew her. And even the irreligious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane had a degree of veneration for her, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably good woman. Few or none have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this character more univerſally than ſhe did, among all ſorts of people, who knew her or heard of her: And not many women had a more numerous acquaintance, or more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive fame. Many educated in her ſchool were afterwards ſettled in diſtant parts, and ſpake in favor of her character and ſchool to their friends and acquaintance. And as ſhe had a great reſpect for the miniſters of the goſpel, ſhe correſponded with ſome of them; and many others viſited her, agreeable to her incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and deſire, when they came to Newport, as did many other religious perſons. By this, as well as what has been before mentioned, her name and character was ſpread abroad, as few or none who viſited her, went away unimpreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her favor, as amiable in her converſation and behavior, and eminently pious and benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent. In converſation ſhe appeared remarkab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mild, pleaſant and cheerful, and diſcovered a modeſt, meek, humble, tender and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent mind, impreſſed with the ſerious, impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant and pleaſing truths and duties of Chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. The law of kindneſs was in her tongue to an uncommon degree. She had a ſtrong, habitual averſion to any thing like aſperſing the character of others, being careful to ſpeak evil of none; and when occaſion offered, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſay all that could be ſaid with truth in favor of the worſt. She was often greatly grieved and rendered very uncomfortable, in
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:035636_0039_10061430A36518A0"/>
companies where ſlander and detraction took place, and would endeavor, when there was opportunity, to divert the converſation from topics ſo diſagreeable to her. This part of her character, of which the above is an imperfect ſketch, rendered her agreeable, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her to the eſteem and affection of all religious perſons who were acquainted with her, or heard a true report of her. And this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured to her the general approbation of all, of every denomination and character, as an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently good woman.</p>
               <p>IN the years 1766, 1767, there was an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common attention to religion, which turned the thoughts of many to Mrs. Oſborn. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to her as a known pious, benevolent chriſtian, to whom they could have eaſy acceſs, that they might enjoy her counſel and prayers. This was the occaſion of numbers reſorting to her houſe. When ſhe ſaw this, and that the number increaſed, ſhe was at a great loſs what to do. She trembled with fear that if ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged their meeting at her houſe, it would be going beyond her ſphere, offend ſome of her chriſtian friends, and give occaſion to ſome not friendly to religion, to ſpeak evil of her and of religion, and ſo do much more hurt than good. On the other hand, ſhe was afraid to diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age them, and refuſe to let them come to her and meet at her houſe, when under apparent concern about their ſouls, leſt, by this, their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:035636_0039_10061430A36518A0"/>
and concern ſhould abate and ceaſe. She adviſed with her chriſtian friends, and ſome miniſters; and upon their adviſing her to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them and attend to them, ſhe granted them liberty to come, and appointed particular times for their coming. The poor Blacks ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared more generally concerned and engaged, than others. They agreed to meet at Mrs. Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born's on the evening of the Sabbath. She ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them, on condition that they ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have orderly in coming and retiring, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways break up ſeaſonably, and that thoſe who were not free ſhould not come without the conſent of their maſters, and that they ſhould not make any acknowledgment to her by at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting any compenſation by preſents, or any other way; declaring that ſhe would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any thing of this kind from them. On theſe conditions they convened in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, commonly to the amount of ſixty or eighty, and ſome times more. Mrs. Oſborn, finding their attention was ſo much to her, was greatly cautious, fearing to go beyond her line, as a woman, in endeavoring to promote their inſtruction and religious impreſſions for the good of their ſouls. She uſed to ſelect paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſcripture, which ſhe thought would be moſt uſeful to them, and from other religious books, and read them to them: And when ſhe had opportunity, ſhe would invite ſome chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian man to pray with them. She took opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to converſe with individuals, and ſome times would give a word of advice to them all.
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:035636_0040_100614324E754370"/>
And where ſhe could, ſhe obtained ſome min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſter to preach to them, and converſe with them; the paſtor of the church, to which ſhe belonged, not being able to attend.</p>
               <p>Theſe meetings continued a year or more, and were the means of the apparent reformation of many, and of the hopeful converſion of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>Among whom were two in particular, who were ſlaves, but ſome years after joined to buy a ticket in a lottery, and drew a prize, by which they both obtained their liberty. Their names were BRISTOL YAMMA, and JOHN QUAMINE. As they were men of good natural a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, and appeared truly pious, and retained the knowledge of the language of the nation from whence they were taken on the gold coaſt, it was thought proper to attempt to fit them to be miſſionaries, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to ſpread the goſpel among the heathen Africans, their breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, for which they appeared greatly deſirous. To promote this deſign a conſiderable collection of money was made in New England. And the Society in Scotland for propagating chriſtian knowledge, ſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney over, which was laid out on them to fit them for the propoſed miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But when they were judged to be fit to enter on the miſſion, the war between Great Britain and America came on, which put a ſtop to the deſign. And before the war was over the latter died; and the former not long after fell into an ill ſtate of health, and died alſo. John Quamine was brought from Africa when he was a boy. He ſaid his father was one of the chief men at Anamabo, and that he ſent him by the captain of a Guineaman to America, to be put to ſchool and inſtructed in the learning of this country; which the captain engaged to do: But, contrary to his promiſes, he ſold him a ſlave for life. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his freedom was obtained, and he was preparing to go to Africa, a letter was written to a black miſſionary at Cape Coaſt Caſtle, informing him of the propoſal of ſending him with his companion miſſionaries to Africa: And relating the ſubſtance of the ſtory which John Quamine told of his father, and the reaſon of his being ſent to America; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to make inquity reſpecting the fact, and inform what he ſhould learn concerning it.

But the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of maternal affection, in truth do I declare, appear to yearn and greatly agitate her, with tears of joy, like that of Jacob's, when he heard that his beloved ſon Joſeph was yet alive.

               <p>Not only Blacks; but numbers of other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple met at Mrs. Oſborn's in this time.

And on Monday evening a number of young women from nine to twenty years old, often above forty or fifty, met together at her houſe, to enjoy her prayers and inſtructions. Mrs. Oſborn at firſt was in doubt about the propriety and expe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And they appeared ſo attentive, and at times ſome of them were ſo impreſſed and affected, that ſhe was encouraged to proceed. On Tueſday evening a large number of boys met in her room for a conſiderable time to receive her inſtruction and bleſſing. Wedneſday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was devoted to the ſtated weekly meeting of the ſociety of women.

On Friday evening a number of heads of families uſed to meet at her houſe for prayer and religious converſation; ſo that ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery week ſome hundreds of perſons met at her houſe for religious purpoſes. This gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant employ to Mrs. Oſborn, and called up her attention, and ſtrong and conſtant exerciſes of mind, while ſhe at the ſame time preſided in a large ſchool of children. Some of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes reſpecting her houſe being thus crowded with people for religious purpoſes, were as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, taken from her diary:</p>

To thee be all the glory forever. In July laſt the number had amounted to three hundred ſouls. And now the Lord has increaſed it to five hundred and twenty five, who have ſtatedly reſorted here. And yet no evil has followed, though my fears have often been alarmed, with reſpect to Lord's day evenings; yet all is quiet, and every company more ſeriouſly compoſed and ſettled in ſteadily purſuing after knowledge.

My heart was then filled with joy and praiſes; and God excited and enabled me to breathe out my ſoul in vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment cries to him for all needful grace, for his ſervant, and for his church. Rejoiced much to think I was once more to enjoy the glorious feaſt, inſtituted by my dear Redeemer.

I was enlarged, in pleading for grace and ſtrength to be beſtowed on my dear young Paſtor; that, though of himſelf he is inſufficient for his great and difficult work; yet, his ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency being of God, he might be made ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful.</p>

                        <hi>Sabbath noon, July</hi> 15.—Bleſs the Lord, O my ſoul, and forget not all his benefits. I have been to the table of the Lord, and he brought me into his banqueting houſe, and his banner over me was love. I ſat under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit was ſweet to my taſte. My ſoul ſaid, It is good for me to be here. I was enabled, with all my powers engaged, to renew my dedication of myſelf to God, and rejoice in my choice of him. I was, in a meaſure, brought to behold his glory in the perfections of his nature. I was enabled to wreſtle with him for victory over my ſins, and to be made more holy. Theſe ſeemed to be my chief errands; and as I was pleading that promiſe, "They that have clean hands ſhall grow ſtronger and ſtronger," this promiſe ſeemed to be whiſpered, I will ſtrengthen thee,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:035636_0044_1006143CE70A4B10"/>
I will uphold thee by the right hand of my righteouſneſs; and ſin ſhall not have dominion over thee.<note n="*" place="bottom">From Mrs. Oſborn's manner of expreſſion here, and in a number of other places, ſome may ſuſpect that ſhe thought promiſes were made to her by ſome particular, immediate revelation, or divine im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, by which ſhe was aſſured that they were then applied to her, which would be a high degree of enthuſiaſm. The truth appears to be this: She had a fixed belief and confidence, that ſhe was a believer in Jeſus Chriſt, and conſequently intereſted in all the promiſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the covenant of grace, and in the whole word of God, whether made to the church collectively, or to individuals, as the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, or chriſtians. Therefore, when her mind was quickened and turned to ſome promiſe, or any number of promiſes in the word of God; and influenced to a ſtrong belief and affecting ſenſe of the good things contained in them, and of the truth, reality, and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of them, ſhe conſidered them as made or belonging to her: And could not THEN doubt of it, as the evidence that ſhe was a real chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian would be clear and irreſiſtible to her own mind, in proportion to her lively view and ſenſe of Chriſt, and the good things contained in the promiſes. In this way ſhe conſidered the promiſes to be applied to her by the Spirit of God, as he was the author of that ſpiritual ſenſe and diſcerning, by which the promiſes were brought into her view, and ſhe was led with ſtrong faith and affection to embrace them. And this every chriſtian has a warrant to do. See Heb. xiii.5. compared with Joſh. i.5.</note>

                     <p>In time of partaking of the element of bread, my heart ſeemed to be moſt broken for ſin: When feeding upon his broken body, I was filled with aſtoniſhment, and made to cry out, "Lord, why me! Why haſt thou given thyſelf for me!" His blood was ſweet to me, as it was ſhed for the remiſſion of ſins. At laſt I broke out in a rapture, "I found the pearl of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt price, my heart doth ſing for joy." I longed to get ſtill nearer, while I ſeemed to be reſting and leaning on my beloved. Surely I did find him whom my ſoul loveth. O aſtoniſhing, all conquering grace! O happy earneſt of more near and intimate communion! O what a feaſt is this! O bleſſed Savior, for appointing ſuch an ordinance! O my ſoul, bleſs God, for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Lord, if this has been the caſe, O convince and humble me, for thou knoweſt I thought I boaſted in none but thee.

O Lord, pity me, for thou knoweſt how oft con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience reproves me for being ſo ungrateful to thee, ſo little ſpeaking to thy praiſe and glory, and I think juſtly too. But, Oh! how ſhall I behave! If I ſpeak, I ſtumble and grieve even thy dear children and ſervants. Lord, direct me, and O haſten the time when I ſhall find no more backwardneſs to praiſe thee, nor fear of giving offence or grieving any; but ſhall chant forth praiſes throughout an endleſs eternity. I bleſs thee, O my God, that there is a day of judgment appointed, wherein the ſecrets of all hearts will be diſcloſed, and I truſt it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the little zeal and gratitude I have ſhown did proceed from right principles, through the infinite riches of thy grace in Jeſus Chriſt.

O that an indifference to the houſe and worſhip of God may not come upon me, now I am hindered from going there. Lord, meet me, and condeſcend to commune with me. Hear the prayers of thy miniſters and people, for thoſe neceſſarily detained, and ſend me a bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of thine houſe. O give me a double portion of thy bleſſed Spirit, that while I am denied the uſe of ordinances, I may enjoy the God of ordinances. Lord, I thank thee for the aſſiſtance thou haſt this day granted me in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near to thee.

O, if this be the caſe, for Chriſt's ſake convince me, and let me be grafted into him, and have real vital union to him; and if this be now the caſe, if I am really united to him by faith, then, Lord, cauſe me to derive ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ual ſtrength from him, who is the head of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. Dear Jeſus, it has been a long, cold, dark winter with me. My graces have been

Now will I ſet up mine <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> for lo! theſe fourteen years, has God preſerved me, ſince I gave up myſelf to him and his Church, in an open and ſolemn manner.

Lord, art thou

Amazing grace. Infinite ſtoop! Well, ſince infinite power is engaged, that ſame Savior, who, by the virtue and energy of his own Godhead, raiſed himſelf from the dead, and aſcended up into heaven by his power, to take poſſeſſion for me, will ſurely accompliſh what is lacking in me, and by the ſame power carry on the glorious work he has begun in my ſoul. Amen. So come, Lord Jeſus.</p>

                        <hi>Monday morning, March</hi> 26.—Yeſterday morning my room ſeemed new and ſtrange. And, for wiſe ends, I was ſhut up, confuſed and ſtraitened: But in the evening had acceſs to the throne of grace. And, Lord, I beſeech thee, let me at this time alſo. And, O may this place be a Bethel. Here let me, with Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, wreſtle with thee for the bleſſings I want, namely, increaſe of all the graces of thy bleſſed Spirit, knowledge, faith, evangelical repentance; yea, and humility, that dear and lovely grace: And for a ſpirit of prayer to be poured out on me. Lord, let me be no longer dumb before thy throne, ſince prayer is the very breath and life of the new creature. Lord, all thy works praiſe thee. And ſhall I alone be ſilent, while the angelic hoſts and ſaints adore! O let me, even me alſo bear my part. And Lord accept my feeble attempts, though I cannot praiſe as glorified angels and ſaints do; nor as thou art worthy to be praiſed and adored; for thou doſt infinitely exceed all praiſe and adoration, thou al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together lovely One in three glorious perſons. O Lord, let me gaze on thy perfections, till I am transformed into the ſame image. O bleſſed be thy name, I ſhall be like thee, when in one everlaſting day I ſhall ſee thee as thou art. Then, Lord, ſhall I be ſatisfied, when I have the open viſion, and full fruition of my God. O ripen me faſt, for Jeſus' ſake, on whom alo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

my ſpirits till afternoon. But then the children grew ſo unruly, and I ſo weary and diſcompoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I knew not what to do with myſelf. I hoped to be refreſhed by retiring; but my ſpirits were ſo ſpent, and confuſed, that I had ſcarce any ſenſe of any thing, and have felt empty ever ſince.</p>
                     <p>Lord, forbid I ſhould ever reſt ſatisfied with the bare external performance of duty. No. It is the God of ordinances I want to find. Without him, all means are empty, and inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to ſatisfy the cravings of an immortal ſoul.

Yea, this Spirit Chriſt hath died to purchaſe. This is the Comforter. This is he who is come to guide his people into all neceſſary truth; to reduce them, when they wander; to quicken them, when they are dull; to help their infirmities, when they know not what to pray for as they ought: Yea, to make interceſſion in them, with groanings which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be uttered; and to fill them with all grace and joy in believing. This is the Spirit whoſe

preſence and continual abode with me I want; and without whom I can do nothing. O God, grant me this, though of myſelf I am vile and unworthy, I ſhall be purified and made holy. Come, bleſſed Spirit, take an everlaſting poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of my whole heart, ſoul and body. I call heaven and earth to witneſs, that thou art the only welcome gueſt, whatever elſe may u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurp authority there; in thee alone I do rejoice: Therefore abide with me, for Jeſus' ſake.</p>

O what a mercy this! that I, who have ſo long been, in a manner, dumb before the throne of grace, all confuſion and wandering, ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain have my mouth opened, and filled with

                        <hi>Tueſday morning, May</hi> 15.—On Saturday evening, Sabbath morning and evening, and yeſterday morning, I have been much refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in writing on death and judgment. I find, by examination, ſtill good ground to hope, through riches of grace, that the great Judge of quick and dead is, in very deed, my ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting friend; and therefore never will diſown me; never will ſay, I know you not, depart from me: But, on the contrary, will ſay, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you before the foundation of the world: For I have paid the ranſom for you; I have redeemed you with the price of my precious blood. I effectually called you in time, and enabled you by faith to embrace me, on my own terms. I made you ſincere, from the day I called you, though you were then very imperfect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>You</hi> was then ſanctified but in part. You groaned under a body of ſin and death, which cauſed you to wander from me, wound your own ſoul, and grieve my bleſſed Spirit. But I kept thee by the bonds of the everlaſting cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enant, and by my mighty power, through faith unto ſalvation. And, for my ſake all thy poor imperfect performances, and ſincere endeavors to ſerve me were accepted. I pitied and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cored thee then. I had a feeling of thy infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. I remembered thy frame, that thou
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:035636_0063_1006146B78965400"/>
waſt but duſt. I heard all thy groanings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of thy ſpiritual enemies, thy inbred luſts and corruptions, as well as Satan and the world, which held thee at a diſtance from me, when thou waſt in that vale of tears. I beheld all thy thirſtings and longings after me and my grace, univerſal obedience and perfection in holineſs. It was I that excited and ſtrengthened them. I encouraged and ſtrengthened thy faith, when thou didſt cleave to me, and would not let me go. I cauſed thee to delight in me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all other objects. I diſcovered ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of my excellencies to thee then, which cauſed thee to be enamored with my beauty; but thou ſaweſt only through a glaſs darkly.</p>
                     <p>But now, behold, the vail is rent from top to bottom. I will never any more hide my face from thee. Come, all thy deſires are fulfilled; all thy imperfections are done away; and, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy wiſh, thou art made perfect in holineſs. Thou ſhalt never find any more wearineſs in my ſervice. And thou mayeſt now with open face behold me, conſtantly look on my perfections, ſee my glory, and the luſtre of it ſhall not confound thee. Come, here is the open viſion, the full fruition thou didſt long for. Come, drink in as much of God now, as thy finite capacity can hold; and I will ſtill enlarge thy capacity: Thou ſhalt paſs from glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to glory; and be more and more transform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the ſame image. Come, drink and ſwim, and drink again of thoſe rivers of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which flow from the right hand of God forevermore. Here is the boundleſs ocean, in
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:035636_0063_1006146B78965400"/>
which thou mayeſt dive throughout the end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ages of eternity, and thy delights ſhall be forever new.</p>
                     <p>Come, ſearch into the wonders of redeeming love and grace, which has brought ſo many of the apoſtate ſons and daughters of Adam to glory: And now, in this everlaſting <hi>now,</hi> give to God the glory of his ſovereign grace. Come, tune thy harp, and ſound upon the higheſt ſtring. Shout aloud for joy; for he has given grace and glory too. Here is no danger of oſtentation or ſpiritual pride; or of grieving any of the inhabitants of this upper world. No, they will all join with thee, and each for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and on thy behalf, give glory to God, in the higheſt ſtrains. Didſt thou long to be thus employed? Well, go on forever to praiſe and adore the glorious Three One. Didſt thou delight to commune with me in providences, as well as in ordinances? Well, thou mayeſt now learn the myſteries of them: They ſhall be unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Unbelief ſhall no more moleſt thee. Now thou ſhalt ſee how by the watchful eye of my prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence, I preſerved thee from every danger. How I ſwayed the ſceptre in righteouſneſs, and cauſed all things to work together for thy good; even when thou ſaidſt, All theſe things are againſt me! I never took my eye from thee; nor turned away from doing thee good. Now, thou mayeſt adore forever, on this account al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; and ſee what thou didſt, when thou didſt commit all thy concerns to me, for time and eternity.</p>

Did they appear the moſt lovely and agreeable of all the inhabitants of the lower world? Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially, when thou didſt diſcern, through their imperfections, as the ſun through a cloud, my image, drawn in an eminent degree upon their ſouls. Didſt thou love them for my ſake, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou ſaweſt them? Were they, in thy eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem, indeed the excellent of the earth? Well, here thou ſhalt forever enjoy the communion of ſaints: Theſe ſhall be thy companions for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. All their imperfections, as well as thine, are done away. They are now perfect, and ſhall never enſnare thee, as even <hi>they</hi> were wont to do. They ſhall never turn off thy eyes from me. No, not the brighteſt ſeraph in all the heavenly regions, ſhall ever be able to do it: Nor all the glittering robes of glorified ſaints and angels. But thou ſhalt enjoy me in all theſe. I will forever feaſt thy ſoul with communications from myſelf. And if I, who am God allſufficient, can make thee happy, thou ſhalt be ſo; for I will be thy portion to eternity.</p>
                     <p>And didſt thou in time, by faith, commit the keeping of thy ſoul and body into my merciful and faithful hands, againſt this great day? I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and enabled thee to do it: And now thou ſeeſt the effect. Thy expectations from me, ſhall never be diſappointed; neither ſhalt thou ever be aſhamed of thy hope. I kept thee by my power, while on earth. I kept thee in the hour of death, when Satan would gladly have
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:035636_0064_1006146E32F82050"/>
hurled thy ſoul into the infernal regions; but he could not pluck thee out of my hands. I ſent thy guardian angels to conduct thy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul to Abraham's boſom. And I ſtill took care of thy mouldering duſt, while in the grave; not an atom of it is loſt. And now, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold! I have raiſed it a glorious body, faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like my own. And now the union between ſoul and body ſhall never be diſſolved; but the dear partner ſhall forever reap together, as they ſowed together. Behold, according to thy faith and hope, I now preſent them ſpotleſs and blameleſs before the throne of God. I have redeemed them by my blood. By my obedience and death I have ſatisfied juſtice, and have purchaſed reconciliation with God. Mercy and truth have met together; righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace have kiſſed each other. I have waſhed away all thy pollutions. And now, I give thee joy; and all the hoſt of heaven give thee joy; therefore enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. I gave thee joy in the day of thy eſpouſals, and in frequent after manifeſtations, as an earneſt of this. Thou haſt had a taſte of the ſame in kind, when I revealed myſelf to thee on earth; but the degree ſhall now be greater than thou couldeſt then aſk or think.</p>

Sometimes I have ſeemed ſo ſwallowed up in them, that I hardly knew how to deſcend to earth again.—Well, my ſoul, thou haſt had a rich feaſt now! Perhaps, a taſte to ſtrengthen
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:035636_0065_1006146FECF46C40"/>
thy faith to thy journey's end. Be exceeding thankful for ſuch views of unſeen and eternal things. Keep the eye of faith ſtill fixed upon them, and run with patience the race ſet before thee; looking and longing for the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the great God, even our Lord and Savior Jeſus Chriſt. And now, in a ſpecial manner, watch and pray, leſt thou enter into temptation. And remember, it is by grace thou ſtandeſt. O, be not high minded, but fear before a holy and ſin hating God; for the glorious things thou haſt ſeen, by an eye of faith, are not yet accompliſhed. Rejoice in hope of the glory of God, and ſtedfaſtly believe that in his own time, all theſe things will be revealed; and therefore march forward in his ſtrength towards the joyful period.</p>
                     <p>But take heed of boaſting, as though thou hadſt already put off the harneſs; for perhaps thou mayeſt be but girding it on. Thou art yet in thy enemies' country. Snares await thee on every ſide. Thou art not out of the reach of ſpiritual pride, or vain glory: Nor out of the reach of unbelief, which may yet raiſe many black clouds, before thou reach the bliſsful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions. Nor haſt thou yet got clear of ſloth and carnal ſecurity. Nay, all the luſts of the fleſh, which now ſeem to be in ſome good degree conquered, may yet riſe up againſt thee. There may yet be ſore conflicts in this field of battle: And though they ſhall not finally overcome, they may ſadly wound thee, and diſhonor God. Again, my ſoul, thou art not yet out of the reach of Satan, who has often deſired to have
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:035636_0065_1006146FECF46C40"/>
thee, that he might ſift thee as wheat. Many a fiery dart may he yet throw at thee, many griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous injections: For though the houſe is built upon the rock Chriſt Jeſus; and therefore ſhall not fall: Yet the rain may deſcend, the floods come, the winds blow, and beat upon it; and thou haſt no reaſon to expect any other.</p>
                     <p>Therefore, I ſay again, watch and pray, leſt thou enter into temptation. And beware leſt ſelf confidence ſhould betray thee; or any of the troubles or amuſements of a vain world. O take heed of hewing out any more broken ciſterns; for they can hold no water. Not all the creatures upon earth, nor all created things, can ever yield thee, my ſoul, that ſatisfaction thou haſt already found in God, that ſpring and fountain of all felicity. Therefore turn not to the creature; but maintain thy reſolution to remain comfortleſs, except he comfort thee with communications from himſelf. Let nothing leſs ſatisfy thee. Thou waſt made to glorify and enjoy him even here. Thou art not obliged to wait till death has done its work: No, even now thou mayeſt anticipate that joy, if thou art not wanting to thyſelf.</p>
                     <p>And I charge thee, my ſoul, harbor no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſts of his grace. Remember this has been thy prevailing infirmity. Therefore watch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this thy own iniquity. It is ſaid of Chriſt; that he did not many mighty works, in his own country, <hi>becauſe of their unbelief.</hi> Let this therefore be laid aſide; and let faith be daily upon the ſcout, ſending it forth continually to Chriſt for freſh ſupplies of grace and ſtrength,
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:035636_0066_100614718C563018"/>
and all ſhall be well. For he is the head of all gracious influences. He has an immenſe ſtock to give out, an inexhauſtible fulneſs for his poor, needy creatures. And who can tell but he may have yet far greater degrees of grace to beſtow on thee? Even ſtrengthening, quickening and ſanctifying grace; for he is thy ſanctification as well as redemption. Who can tell but I ſhall be much more conformed to his bleſſed image, even here? Though perfection in holineſs is not to be obtained in this life; yet grace is abſolutely free and ſovereign. Some have been made eminent patterns of pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, though in themſelves unworthy, as well as I. Some lights have ſo ſhined, that others ſeeing their good works, have glorified their Father who is in heaven. O my God, unworthy wretch as I am, yet glorify thyſelf in me alſo. O, faſhion me after my great pattern: Make me holy, harmleſs, undefiled, and ſeparate from ſinners.</p>

O fooliſh and unwiſe! thus to keep groveling among the corruptions of my own heart; trying to ſound the bottom of that great deep, till I am ſo overwhelmed, that I know not how to look up. And as if that was not enough, now I am mourning over my natural temper, and complaining of that, as if it was the worſt that ever mortal had. Oh, is not here a degree of murmuring againſt that God, who in infinite wiſdom gave me my conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as well as my being; and knows how to overrule my paſſions, and make them ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to his glory? O, why cannot I watch, and endeavor to quench the fire when it is like to kindle, or has broke out; without drowning myſelf with the water? What, my ſoul, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

of thy faith and courage? Whither is the great Captain of thy ſalvation gone <hi>now,</hi> that thou haſt no more eye to him? Muſt he be forgotten; faith's mouth be ſtopped; and all becauſe nothing more has befallen thee, than what thou haſt had all thy days? This bad heart, and this bad temper, thou haſt always had; and yet Jeſus hath not deſpiſed thee; but hath pitied and ſuccored thee. He hath had a feeling of all thine infirmities. And how many thouſand times hath he leaped over theſe mountains of thy ſins and infirmities, and come to thee and embraced thee. Theſe did not keep him out at firſt. No, he was gracious, becauſe he would be gracious then. He freely loved thee; and whom he loves, he loves to the end. Is God deceived in me? Is he a man, that he ſhould lie; or the ſon of man, that he ſhould repent? Did he not know, even from eternity, juſt what I ſhould be in time? Surely he did. And yet determined to be gracious to me. And why, my ſoul, art thou now caſt down; and why diſquieted within me? Hope in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, who is the health of my countenance, and my God.</p>

This is the way to my Father's houſe; and through it I muſt paſs ſooner or later, or I can never be perfectly holy; never ſee his glorious face without a vail; never but through a glaſs darkly.

                        <hi>September</hi> 15, <hi>Sabbath morning.</hi>— As I awoke today I was refreſhed by theſe words, "This is the day the Lord hath made, we will rejoice and be glad in it." And theſe, "O that I knew where I might find him! That I might

come even to his ſeat! I would order my cauſe before him, and fill my mouth with arguments." —In reading Rom. vii. alſo, the Spirit of God bore witneſs with my ſpirit, that it is my daily experience that I do delight in the law of God, after the inward man. Notwithſtanding the law in my members, warring againſt the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of ſin which is in my members.</p>
                     <p>Grace was for a few minutes drawn forth into ſenſible, lively exerciſe; and I appeared to myſelf as a veſſel which had been wind bound, and could by no means get forward, while wind and tide were againſt it. But, now, as there ſeemed to be a favorable gale, determined to weigh anchor, hoiſt ſail, ply my work, and make all ſpeed towards the deſired haven.—</p>
                     <p>But, alas! ere I could get to my cloſet, to pour out my ſoul to God there, I ſeemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calmed again. May I improve every breeze of the Spirit, ſince, as the wind he bloweth when and where he liſteth. The Lord make me thankful, that I have not been all the days of my life left deſtitute of his operations.</p>
                     <p>This evening refreſhed and ſtrengthened by the dear Mediator's prayer, John xvii. whom the Father heareth always; Yea, and he will fulfil his requeſt, though I cannot pray as I ought. O my ſoul, believe and be comforted; for he will keep thee from the evil. He will ſanctify thee through the truth. He will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the union between his bleſſed ſelf, and thee. He will ere long take thee to himſelf, to

A precious view of Chriſt, in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic office, renewed my choice of him: In

this pleaded my great need of divine teaching; believed he would teach me by his bleſſed Spirit, and lead me into all neceſſary truth. Rejoiced in him, as the great and only teacher come from heaven.

The direct contrariety to a holy God, and the ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs of my perverſe will, my unbelief, pride, ſloth, hypocriſy of my heart, how awfully guilty, how deeply polluted. This I bewailed, and that I have been a tranſgreſſor from the womb; an ungrateful abuſer of divine mercy. But Chriſt Jeſus appeared ſo glorious and lovely in his prieſtly office, that my ſoul was tranſported with joy: His obedience and his blood; his glorious reſurrection and ſeſſion at his Father's right hand; his being touched with the feeling of my infirmities. My ſoul flew to him, and embraced him, as my great High Prieſt, my great Advocate in the court of heaven: Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for juſtification, a free and full pardon, for his ſake alone. A view ſtill of the great power and tyranny of ſin, Satan and the world, to draw off my heart from God. Renewed my choice of Chriſt, as my abſolute ſovereign, my Prince, as well as Savior: Committed my precious ſoul again into his merciful and faithful hands. Yea, and he will keep, by his mighty power, what I have committed to him, for he is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious King, and he is my God and King, and I will, by his grace, be his loyal ſubject forever.</p>

Had a precious ſeaſon at the throne of grace in making over all my vaſt concerns into the hands of Chriſt, pleading that he might fully poſſeſs me by his Spirit, in every room and faculty of my ſoul. O let all my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and affections be collected and ſent, and all my delights lodged above in the higheſt heaven, where Chriſt Jeſus is. Lord, ſo wean me from things below that I may in a moment be ready to paſs over Jordan to meet thee.</p>
                     <p>O my God, I have lately ſeen what the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of death mean. A ſhocking ſight, indeed, while the poor unprepared ſoul ſhrinks back and would lodge in its crazy cottage! But go it muſt, and appear before God. I had a deep ſenſe of things, while with my dying neighbor, and God enabled me to ſend up ſtrong cries to him for the poor ſoul. My ſpirits were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed, and my whole framed cruſhed with the weight. But alas! time is fled and gone, and the ſtate of the ſoul is unalterably fixed in bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs eternity. Whether in weal, or woe, God knows: I determine not. But this I know, that the will of a juſt and ſovereign God is done, and he is glorified, yea and will be glorified: And may his will be forever done, whatever becomes of his enemies. In their miſery, ſtrictly ſpeaking, I do not rejoice; but in God's being glorified I do, and will rejoice. Let every one, who finally loves not the Lord Jeſus, be accurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yea, let all in me that loves him not, be bitterly accurſed. Let all that will not ſubmit to the ſceptre of his grace be cruſhed with his iron rod; yea, let him daſh them in pieces as a

Will God graciouſly pardon all my deficiencies in the inſtruction of this, as well as all my other children, and accept of any ſincerity thou haſt ſeen, in my endeavors to ſave the precious ſouls. Bleſſed be thy name, my gracious God, for the teſtimony of my conſcience, in that I have labored, and longed for their ſalvation, though not ſo much as I ought.

                     <p>My bodily diſorders have followed me more violently ſince Thurſday, than before. Was very ill all Friday night, yeſterday and laſt night; but bleſſed be God, not comfortleſs; no, adored be his name, very far from that, eſpecially laſt night, when I began to cheriſh a hope, that this ſickneſs would be unto death. O joyful proſpect of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, while well aſſured that I have repoſed my truſt in a glorious all ſufficient ſavior. I know on whom I have believed, and can gladly venture through the dark valley of the ſhadow of death, and fear no evil, for God is with me, Chriſt with me. I have fled to him for refuge, and he will keep me.</p>
                     <p>My affections are very ſtrong toward my dear conſort, my honored aged mother, my dear chriſtian friends, from whom, under God, I have received ſo much comfort. My heart was raiſed in thankfulneſs to God for all the comfort, and refreſhment he hath beſtowed, on his poor, weary, unworthy worm, in her tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome pilgrimage, and for all the dear privileges, with which he hath indulged me; for miniſters, eſpecially my dear paſtor; for his written word, precious promiſes, ſabbaths, ſacraments, and all ſanctuary enjoyments; theſe were all dear, all precious; but I could gladly reſign them all, for full enjoyment of my precious Chriſt; can cheerfully commit my dear conſort, mother, and dear friends, into the merciful and faithful hands of God, relying on his care and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious

providence, which hath, and will ſtill provide for them: The God who hath fed me all my life!</p>
                     <p>Having taken my farewell of things dear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, I ſeemed to be looking and longing for the joyful period. But, O, if it be the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign pleaſure of my gracious God, to ſay, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, I ſubmit. His will be done on earth, as it is in heaven! It is meet ſuch a worm ſhould, with patience, wait his time, if he hath any thing for me to do, or ſuffer. If he will give me grace, if he will ſanctify me more, give me more holineſs, that I may glorify him upon earth, all is well. But I cannot think of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining here, ſo unlike to God. Lord, ſanctify me more, for Jeſus' ſake alone.</p>

And here I have lived ſecure and at reſt, amidſt many ups and downs, frowns and flatteries from creatures. The leſs Reaſon hath had to work upon, the more freely Faith hath caſt itſelf upon the faithfulneſs of God; and here my expectations have never been diſappointed.

He needed it not. When he hath ſeen me op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, he hath always appeared for me, and done all things well, and will ſtill care for me. Why need I be anxious? What need is there of any change of buſineſs or circumſtance? Now I have a competency of the comforts of life, food and raiment, convenient. Friends, yea enemies at peace with me.</p>
                     <p>And now, with the fool in the goſpel, I muſt needs be for pulling down my barns and build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing larger to beſtow my goods. Saying, Soul, take thine eaſe; as if my happineſs conſiſted in theſe, when I know, and am aſſured it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be found in worldly good. Nothing but God alone can ſatisfy the ſoul. Oh how have I committed, two evils, in forſaking the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and hewing out broken ciſterns, that can hold no water. Surely Satan hath ſtirred up himſelf now; but God hath, and will make a way for my eſcape. He will not ſuffer me to be tempted above that I am able to bear.</p>

by a greedy wolf, eager to tear in pieces, and ſwallow up quick: A bear, bereaved of her whelps, eſpies and purſues the ſame prey, and reſolves, if poſſible, to poſſeſs and deſtroy it. A roaring lion, alſo, no leſs greedy, ſeeks to devour. They all purſue: And what can the poor creature do! It is helpleſs. Any one of theſe, ſhould they overtake, would deſtroy in a moment. Would even a ſilly ſheep go to meet theſe enemies, or ſtand ſtill? No, its fears would almoſt give it wings. How ſwift would it run to ſome ſhelter, to its ſhepherd! And would its ſhepherd ſtand and look on, ſee it in this diſtreſs, and not ſcreen it? Would he give it up to thoſe devourers, when it is his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar buſineſs to guard it from them; it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to his care, he is called its keeper? No, no.</p>
                     <p>Neither will my glorious Shepherd give me up to ſin, which like a ravenous wolf, is ever ſeeking to tear my ſoul in pieces. Nor ſhall the world, greedy as a bear, ſwallow me up. My Chriſt has bid me be of good courage; for he has overcome the world. Nor will the Lion of the tribe of Judah ſuffer Satan, that roaring lion, to devour me.</p>
                     <p>O my ſoul, only act the part that a poor, feeble ſheep would do, and thou art ſafe; thy glorious Shepherd will keep thee. Often has he reſcued thee: He has kept thee hitherto.

Bleſſed Jeſus, without thee I can do nothing but mock thee. O, ſend thy holy Spirit to warm my heart from time to time, to indite my petitions, and enable me to adapt my language to the capacities of the children. Make this path of duty plain before me. Preſerve me from the zeal of a Jehu. And preſerve me from being aſhamed of thee and thy ways, in this crooked and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe generation, in this time of lukewarmneſs, and awful declenſions and backſliding.

                        <hi>Tueſday evening, March</hi> 4.—The laſt day of my forty ſixth year is now run out, a little more than twenty three of which I have openly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Chriſt. But oh! how little have I lived to his glory. I would be humbled that I have made no greater proficiency in the ſchool of Chriſt in twenty three years; and alſo that the half of my life was, as it were, without God in the world. I would alſo lament before God all my backſlidings from him; and that to this day there are ſuch bitter remains of contrariety to him: So much of pride, paſſion, unbelief, ſloth, worldly mindedneſs, and what not!</p>
                     <p>But, O my ſoul, let not thy lamentations end in ingratitude; but bleſs God for all recoveries from declenſions; for all the victories thy glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious King has given thee over the world, the fleſh and the devil. That amidſt ſuch an ocean of corruptions, ſuch a flood of temptations, the ſpark of grace is yet alive. That God has, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all my fears, preſerved me from all open violations of his law, which would have been to the diſhonor of his dear name. God knows my fears and dread of this. Adored be his name, that for his own ſake he has hitherto delivered me from all my fears. Where is the fury of the oppreſſor, who has often appeared as if ready to deſtroy? But hitherto the Lord has helped me. And I will rejoice and bleſs him, that by his grace I am what I am; though
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:035636_0123_100614F394338DF8"/>
I am not what I long to be; yet I will hope in his mercy, that his grace ſhall be ſufficient for me; and he will complete his begun work in my ſoul. He will not leave it unfiniſhed: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earth, ſin, nor hell ſhall prevail againſt me. My jewel, my all, is in ſafe hands, even in the faithful hands of a glorious Chriſt. And though my ſins of heart, and all my ſins, are againſt him; yet his precious blood cleanſes from all ſin. To that I fly this night for pardon and cleanſing.</p>
                     <p>Lord, my days are now far advanced. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſix years paſſed and gone, never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called. O let the remaining be devoted to thee. Bleſſed be thy name, it cannot be long before I reach my eternal home. O, help me to work while the day laſts, to fulfil as an hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling my day. All thy works praiſe thee, and thy ſaints bleſs thee. Let me alſo, who am the work of thy hands, bear my part in this lower world. Thy ſaints may profit by it. O, let me not be an idle ſpectator, but an active doer of thy will: And cheerfully ſuffer and ſubmit to all thy will; and cleave to thee, and ſpeak honorably of thee to all around me, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every diſpenſation of thy providence, whether merciful or afflictive. I would renew my thanks to God this night, for the mercies of the year paſt, ſpiritual and temporal. Thou haſt by thy almighty power bowed my will, and brought me to caſt my care on thee for daily bread: And thou haſt provided it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually; I have lacked nothing.

food; for thou wilt not give me a ſtone in this reſpect, any more than in the other. Thou knoweſt I have cried more for grace, than for daily bread; and thou wilt anſwer, becauſe I am Chriſt's, and Chriſt is thine, and I am thine forever.</p>

Dear Jeſus, keep my frame of mind, as well as my ſoul, in thine own hands. I commit this to thy charge.

And as it is thy ſovereign pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure, that my circumſtances call me rather to

receive than give, I would cheerfully ſubmit, and believe it is beſt of all. Lord, any thing, any circumſtance in life thou ſeeſt beſt; ſo thou wilt but make me ſtrong in faith, lead me to, and hold me near thyſelf, and all is well. If my hands may not relieve the poor, pour out on me a Spirit of prayer for them. O per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to bring them to thee in the arms of faith and prayer, to thy full ſtores, day by day, that <hi>theſe</hi> their wants may be ſupplied.</p>
                     <p>And yet, as opportunities offer, and God gives leave, let me cheerfully caſt in my mites for their ſupport. O never let me be unmind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the poor, the ſick and languiſhing, the priſoner and captive, the aged, and the tempted ſoul. O my God, ſince thou haſt done ſo great things for me, I pray thee, fill me with bowels of compaſſion, and let the widow and fatherleſs ſtill be the objects of my tender concern and care. And may my zeal for the ſupport of thy goſpel never die. Let me ſtill cheerfully do all I can: And when I can do no more, Lord, help me to pray continually that thy goſpel may be ſupported, and for the proſperity of Zion; and, O God, hear and anſwer for Jeſus' ſake.</p>
                     <p>Let God glorify himſelf; and let him do as ſeemeth good to him. I have no other choice to make this new year, but that God may be glorified in me and mine, and all affairs and things. And yet, while I am thus anxiouſly careful for nothing, I would daily, in every thing, by prayer and thankſgiving make known my requeſts to God. I would pray more than ever, from the exalted views, and earneſt long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings

that God may be glorified. O, are not theſe motives as ſtrong to make me thirſt and long and wreſtle, as anxious, diſtreſſing cares? O God, let me not be freed from them in vain; but now may I get up and run with more vigor and cheerfulneſs than ever the ways of thy commandments, rejoicing in God, and in all the great and glorious events of his providence.</p>

                        <hi>Thurſday morning, February</hi> 19.—Yeſterday I was comfortable ſome part of the day, and came through the whole as well as uſual.—In the evening ſerious and engaged when telling my friends of the ſociety, when met, of the dealings of God with the ſoul of Mr. —. And when I came to pray for him, my whole ſoul was engaged! He appeared to me, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:035636_0135_100615104140E858"/>
he was, hovering juſt on the brink of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, and ready to launch into it in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And God gave me a deep ſenſe of the worth of his precious ſoul; of his utter inability to help himſelf.—Of his utter unworthineſs to receive mercy, and mine, or ours, earneſtly to apply to the throne of grace in his behalf: But pleaded encouragements from our being jointly engaged for mercy for him, and I truſt we really were ſo throughout the room. I bleſs God, who gave ſuch a number of us op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to unite, and implore mercy for him, and commit him into the hands of a glorious Chriſt, to be clothed with the all glorious and ſpotleſs robe of his righteouſneſs; in which he might lift up his head before ſtrict and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial juſtice, before the bar of a holy God. I could heartily plead the glory of God in the ſalvation of this ſoul; and had a lively view of the joy in heaven in the preſence of the bleſſed angels over this ſinner repenting and arriving there. And I humbly truſt my ſenſible view both of the worth of his ſoul—his undone ſtate without Chriſt—his unworthineſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, or mine to implore mercy—the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſufficiency of Chriſt for him, as well as for Jeruſalem ſinners who had imbrued their hands in his own precious blood—and the glory that would redound to God, both in heaven and on earth, in the ſalvation of this ſoul—was from God; that thoſe diſcoveries were from him, and the deſires were excited by his own Spirit. It was he who emboldened me, who am but duſt and aſhes, thus to draw near,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:035636_0135_100615104140E858"/>
and plead with a righteous God. And I will hope he has anſwered the deſires of his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing.</p>
                     <p>It was between ſeven and eight o'clock when we were thus united at the throne of grace, more than ten in number. And a little before nine dear Suſa (Miſs Anthony) was our mouth, and ſpread his caſe again before God with earneſtneſs and importunity.—And before we broke up we heard the bell toll for his death. And I believe it was Satan who ſuggeſted to me, that my deſires were not excited by the Spirit of God; for he was not then the ſubject of prayer; and therefore my prayer was loſt; for God never aſſiſted any to pray for the dead.—It gave my ſpirits a conſiderable damp: For I verily thought that God by his Spirit had held me up to wreſtle with him, and given me ſuch boldneſs and freedom of acceſs; and even ſtrong confidence that God would hear and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for Chriſt's ſake. And if he was dead at that very time, I knew not what to make of it! Still I could not help thinking God was with me of a truth in that prayer. I therefore went down to the houſe, and inquired, at what time he died? And his ſiſter told me, Juſt at nine. —And God did help me: And he ſhall have all the glory, while I rejoice in hope that he is glorified in heaven, for the ſalvation of that ſoul.—And now, my God, lay me in the duſt. —And comfort the near and dear relations, and all to whom he was dear. And ſanctify it to all this town, and to all who may hear of it.</p>

And for a few minutes had freedom, while breathing after perfection of holineſs, and a freedom from every clog and interruption to my communion with, and enjoyment of my God. Some long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings that the body might be laid to reſt, and ſleep it out in the grave, while I, free from all ſin, ſickneſs or wearineſs, ſhall worſhip, enjoy and adore, as glorified ſaints and angels do. However, here I ſubmitted to the divine will, and turned my plea for greater degrees of grace and ſtrength for us all, that God might be glorified by us. Theſe deſires, I truſt, were excited by God's own Spirit, and ſhall be heard and anſwered, though I was not able to perſiſt. "Think not that ye ſhall be heard for your much ſpeaking," ſaid my deareſt Lord. O, let me not limit God, and confine the bleſſing to long prayers; nor yet form excuſes for ſhort formal prayers.</p>

She, as the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate widow, followed God with plea upon plea, in the Mediator's name. She aſked in faith and hope. Her petitions and confeſſions and pleadings, as well as thankſgivings, were, I truſt, all excited by the bleſſed Spirit. And God will delight to anſwer. I often think of what I heard Mr. Byram ſay of Mr. Brainerd, when he was telling of his wreſtling in prayer in the wilderneſs for the converſion of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. "I verily thought," ſaid he, "that the dear man would have died upon the ſpot."— So it often ſeems as if ſhe would breathe out her ſoul in prayer. The Lord be praiſed! O, aſſiſt her ſtill more and more. Would to God all his children were ſuch wreſtling Jacobs.— And now, my God, into thy merciful and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful hands I commit my ſoul, my body and all my concerns this day.

God did ſolemnize my ſpirit when in public worſhip, in prayer and in preaching, and ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too. An excellent ſermon was delivered from Matthew xxviii. 18. "And Jeſus came and ſpake unto them ſaying, All power is given unto me in heaven and in earth." Bleſſed Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, what a ſweet diſcovery was this to thy poor diſciples, when they were worſhipping thee; but ſome doubting; a diſcovery of thy glorious power to forgive all manner of ſin and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;

to vanquiſh Satan; ſubdue our luſts, though ever ſo numerous and ſtrong; to ſtrengthen the believer though ever ſo weak; to enable to overcome the world, in all its cares, pleaſures, vanities and frowns; to reſiſt Satan in all his wiles and ſtratagems; yea, and overcome him too; yea, to overcome every e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil that can beſet us in our way. O Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, then fear flees before us, however weak in ourſelves, and of ourſelves can do nothing, yet then are we ſtrong.—O for greater diſcoveries of this glorious attribute to both ſaints and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. Saints ſhall ſtand up and rejoice, grow ſtrong and adore, becauſe greater is he who is for them, than all who are againſt them; and none can pluck them out of his hand, or over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw his work in their ſouls. O diſcover more and more of thy glorious power, bleſſed Jeſus, to me. And let every dear child of thine ſhare with me. O, rejoice the whole body of thy militant church, ſince thy power is not limited. No; all power is given unto thee, in heaven and in earth. O let our ſouls ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ult and triumph in our almighty Redeemer; and in all our future ſtraits, let the eye of our faith be unto thee.

                     <p>O reviving truth! Chriſt will accompliſh all that concerns us, ſince all power is in his hands. O what a dear Redeemer is this! How mighty to ſave! Who is this! who comes trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elling

There is forgiveneſs with thee; that thou mayeſt be feared. Dear Jeſus, ſince all power is given to thee, in heaven and in earth, keep me in the ſtrait path.

And if I am his <hi>now,</hi> let me evidence it to all who know me, by keeping his dear commandments, doing juſtice, loving mercy, and walking humbly with God.</p>
                     <p>Now let me frequently appear among the Lord's people. Now others are crowding to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, running all riſques to attend the devil's entertainments, let love to Jeſus Chriſt and each other, excite us to meet and viſit each other. Let us who fear the Lord, ſpeak often one to another; and in all humility give him the glory of his ſovereign graces; declare what he has done and is doing for our ſouls. Let us ſhow forth his faithfulneſs, and encourage each other to put our truſt in him; for he is a faithful God, and none ever truſted in him, and was put to ſhame. O may the whole of our converſation be to ſpeak honorably of God, exalt God and Chriſt, and the operations of his bleſſed Spirit, and grace; and lay ſelf in the duſt. O let ſelf be debaſed. O let us never forget a <hi>Not I</hi>—Not unto me, Not unto me; but to God be glory. Thus let us communicate to each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and provoke to emulation. Thus let us ſcatter, and yet increaſe. Thus let us blow up

the coals, till we are all a flame of love to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt and each other.</p>
                     <p>Lord, thus bleſs our dear Society. Thus let us love as chriſtians; yes, as <hi>primitive chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians,</hi> who were dear to each other, as their own lives. Let us begin to live and love, as they do in heaven. Let us, while here on earth, a bound in piety towards God, and charity to men; eſpecially the houſehold of faith—Chriſt's dear ſick and poor—Chriſt's precious ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors. O let us build upon the dear, the ſure foundation, Chriſt Jeſus, all the good works we can do. Let the words of Chriſt, "In as much as ye did it unto them, ye did it unto me," be as oil to our wheels, to make them run ſwiftly.</p>
                     <p>O may God reward every kind benefactor he has raiſed to me in every time of diſtreſs. May they never loſe their reward, though they did it to one of the leaſt of thine. Let them hear thee ſay, dear Lord, to their precious ſouls, even here, "Inaſmuch as ye did it, ye did it unto me." O reward them a thouſand fold into their own boſoms. And may gratitude ever glow in my breaſt to God and to them. And as I have freely received, in times of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, ſo let me freely give, as God enables, and occaſion offers. Lord, ever open my hand and heart to the ſick, poor and needy; and make me a bleſſing in my day. O, make me extenſively uſeful, in my family, in my ſchool, in the dear, dear ſociety, and to all around me. O, let the Lord God Almighty delight to own me, to uſe me, to ſet me apart for himſelf, in ſecret, in private, and in every way my proper

I am ſtill, through his grace, a living monument of his mercy, and a witneſs of his truth and faithfulneſs. He by his grace enabled me in the beginning of this year to commit all my affairs into his wiſe and faithful hands. And he has, bleſſed be his name, kept me almoſt throughout the year cheerfully leaving my affairs with him. I have lived ſecurely on the wiſdom and care of my heavenly Father. And he has done all things well. He has fed me and mine to the full; and comfortably cloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us too. I have not known either pinch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wants, or carking cares. I have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled to make ſatisfactory payments to thoſe with whom I have had dealings; and to do ſomething towards the ſupport of the goſpel, and relief of the neceſſitous: And in this God has given me the deſires of my heart.

                     <p>O my God, accept my thankſgivings for Jeſus' ſake: And for his ſake alone freely par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don

Draw forth faith into exerciſe, Lord, and help me to believe now for grace to walk uprightly, as well as for tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. O, may my firm truſt and confidence be fixed on God the enſuing year; yea, all of it, if I may live to ſee it. O God, let my will be ſwallowed up in thine all my remaining days. Thou good and gracious God, thou kind ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efactor, thou dear Savior, and thou bleſſed comforter, let the time paſt ſuffice that I have grieved thee: Yea, more than ſuffice; let it break my very heart, that I have done ſo. Oh, I would bewail it before God, with deep hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and tears of contrition. And now, O Lord, ſanctify me throughout. Now conform me to thine image.

                     <p>THE firſt duty I ſeem to be called to this year, is reſignation to the divine will; for the pain and confuſion of my head is ſuch, that I ſeem altogether unfit for active obedience. Well, it is the Lord; let him do with me, what ſeemeth him good. I am ſure I had better ſubmit, and take all well from his hands, than to ſtruggle. He ſtands in no need of me: And when active obedience is moſt pleaſing to him, he will ſpirit me to yield it. I would humbly beg for myſelf, this new year's day, a ſtronger faith and a reſigned will; that I may acquieſce in all the will of God, without exception in the enſuing year. Methinks I have no choice of circumſtances to make, let them be what they will, merciful, or afflictive; only that God will glorify himſelf in all, reſign me to his will in all. Lord, it is not a careleſs inſenſibility I am aſking; but real ſtrong faith and a childlike ſubmiſſion, and rejoicing in the will of my heavenly Father. Nor would I chooſe even this (though the moſt delightful, happy frame on this ſide heaven) merely from ſelfiſh views; but that God may be glorified hereby. I would not aſk it, if inconſiſtent with the glory of God. But O my God, will not this be for thy glory? Then for Chriſt's ſake grant it, this new year's day. Give me this new year's gift, that ſhall laſt all the year, if I live; even a ſtrong faith, working by love, and influencing to univerſal obedience, and entire ſubmiſſion to all the will of God. Let it be what it will, I would object

<pb n="287" facs="unknown:035636_0144_100615255FAD0DF8"/>
of laſt year, he enabled me to give up all that was dear to me, what advantage has he ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of my ſolemn ſurrenders? Verily, though he has a right to all my comforts, to take them all away juſt when he pleaſes, whether I reſign or not, yet he has ſpared them all, and added to the number; and given me the ſweet of them, as he daily gives me to ſee all flowing from his bountiful hand; that dear, that faithful hand, that will give me nothing to hurt me; from that infinite wiſdom that knows infallibly what is beſt for me; from that love, truth and faithfulneſs that has ſaid, All things ſhall work together for the good of thoſe who love God, of whom I truſt I am one.</p>
                     <p>And now, my ſoul, in time of proſperity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice in God. Now let him have all thy love, all thy warm affections. Set them not on the creature comforts he has preſerved and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. No, no! Now may God be all in all. And ſince he has ſo graciouſly anſwered my choice and reſignation, and thus filled faith's mouth with bleſſings; now, my ſoul, open thy mouth wide, and cling to thy faithful God, that his grace may be ſufficient for thee, for the preſent day, and for every day, and for every change God ſhall ſee beſt for me; and for my great and laſt change.</p>
                     <p>My ſoul, think not to build thy neſt in the lap of proſperity. This is not thy reſt. Sit not down ſo content, as to make this thy home. Bleſs God for theſe refreſhments in the inn; but remember thou art a pilgrim and a ſtranger.

God has been with me in the night watches, in my waking hours; and I have contentedly lain by, when he would not have me work. And I will as cheerfully get up and work and run, when he ſhall reſtore bodily ſtrength, and enlarge my heart.</p>
                     <p>"Take my yoke upon you, ſaid Chriſt, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart; and ye ſhall find reſt to your ſouls. For my yoke is eaſy, and my burden light.—Ye ſhall have reſt in ſickneſs, as well as in health. My yoke is eaſy. I require no hard things of you.
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:035636_0145_10061527F1E1ED90"/>
Nothing more than I will give ſtrength of body, and grace ſufficient to perform. My bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den is light. I do not bind heavy burdens up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. No; I bear your burdens, I feel your griefs and infirmities. Only rely on me, ſubmit to my will, and all ſhall be well. Wait in a way of believing patiently for me, and I will return and help thee. I will ſtrengthen thee. I will uphold thee. Make no impatient complaints, as though I were cruel, and expect to reap where I have not ſown. Do not repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent me, as expecting ten talents in return, if I commit but two. No; be diligent when able, be ſubmiſſive when diſabled, depending on me alone for all aſſiſtance and acceptance; and my yoke ſhall never gall thee, nor my burden preſs thee down. Thou ſhalt ever find me a kind maſter in life to the end of it. My grace ſhall be ſufficient for thee. Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life." Amen, Lord, Amen.—</p>

The Lord ſanctify it to my aged mother, and to me; and enable us to follow him, who, through faith and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, is gone to inherit the promiſes. Thanks be to God, for his diſtinguiſhing grace to him; and that thou didſt make him ſo rich a bleſſing to thy church, and continue him ſo long a faithful laborer in thy vineyard. Thanks be to God for the ſucceſs thou didſt grant him; for the ſeals of his miniſtry; that thou didſt not ſuffer him to toil all the night, and catch noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Or if he did, yet when at thy command he let down the goſpel net again, he caught many, both in Hereford, and at London too.</p>
                     <p>Thanks be to God for that patience and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation to thy divine will, thou didſt grant to thy ſervant, under all the afflictive diſpenſations of thy all wiſe providence; when thou didſt take away the deſire of his eyes with a ſtroke; and when thou waſt pleaſed to take away the light of his eyes, that he could no more behold the light of this world, or objects of ſenſe. That then thou didſt reſign his will, cauſe him cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to acquieſce in it: That then thou didſt ſtrengthen the eye of faith to behold inviſibles, to behold its glorious object. Now faith is ſwallowed up in open viſion and full fruition, as I ſuppoſe.</p>
                     <p>Hail, happy ſoul, all hail! I congratulate thee on thy ſafe arrival to the bliſsful regions. O, let me by faith peep in a little, and view thee now thou haſt dropped thy clog of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality.

All hail again! What! Canſt thou now worſhip in the moſt humble, and yet exalted ſtrains, without the leaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of taint of that abominable thing which God's ſoul hateth?

                     <p>O, when ſhall I arrive to this perfection of holineſs: Thou wilt not fear for me there. I ſhall never damp thee more. My odious pride ſhall have no being there. Let me leap for joy, or ſhout as loud as I will the riches of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, free, rich, ſovereign grace, thou wilt join me. I ſhall never unſtring thy harp, nor thou mine. O thanks be to God, that I am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing in hope of coming to thee, to be with thee, and to be with Chriſt, which is far better.</p>
                     <p>O for grace to make haſte, and finiſh the work God has given me to do. I would fulfil as a diligent hireling my day. But, my God, permit me to long for the ſhadows of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. O, to me to live, is Chriſt; but to die, unſpeakable gain. Let not the Lord be angry. Indulge me a little here, while, through thy grace, my ſoul breaks for the longing it hath for a freedom from ſin. Oh monſter!—And the full enjoyment of thyſelf.

That God was going, in mercy, to ſet his weary pilgrim free from the intolerable burden of ſin, and take me to himſelf, to behold his glory. And as my diſorders increaſed, my hope aroſe to a ſtrong perſuaſion that I ſhould die. And O how did my eager ſoul preſs forward, and bid death ten thouſand welcomes! My God, my covenant, faithful God, ſhone in upon his own work in my ſoul; gave me clear and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial evidences of my union to Chriſt by faith. All was calm within. I had enough to do to admire the aſtoniſhing goodneſs of God to me, inwardly and outwardly. Mercies flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in upon me from every quarter.

As to fears of hell, thou knoweſt I am almoſt if not wholly without them, whether from faith or ſtupidity, I cannot tell: But it is certain I am not actuated by ſlaviſh fears of hell.

They are fears of provoking God to withdraw yet more from my ſoul; fears of his leaving me to hardneſs of heart, blindneſs of mind, barrenneſs of ſoul; and to fall ſo far as to wound his glorious, precious name.

                     <p>GOD has again brought us to one of our appointed ſeaſons of prayer. O God, ſay not, Your new moons and appointed ſeaſons, my ſoul hates: But for Chriſt's ſake, condeſcend, this day, to impreſs upon our ſouls a deep ſenſe of our ſins. O that we may this day lie in the

duſt and bewail before God all our hypocriſy, all our formality and covetouſneſs, which is idolatry.

Lord God, pour out thy Spirit upon us, a ſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it of humiliation, prayer and ſupplication. O that thou wouldeſt rend the heavens, and come down, and cauſe all mountains that riſe in our way of acceſs and conformity to thee, to flow down at thy preſence. O excite our cries for thy church univerſal; for all the world of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; for thy miniſters every where; for our miniſter and church in particular. Lord, have mercy upon us, and yet revive us, for Jeſus Chriſt's ſake. And let us, thy poor, unworthy handmaids, yet rejoice in thy ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>And ſtill permit me to feed thy lambs, and devote my whole life to the ſervice of my God. In the Beloved let me be accepted: And thus let all thine be accepted. O be in the midſt of us this day! Say me not nay; but come and ſanctify us throughout. O make us holy, as God is holy.</p>

                        <hi>Saturday morning, November</hi> 8.—Lord, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee, ſhow me yet more and more of my own vileneſs, for the ſuppreſſion of my vile pride. Shew me thy purity, and how far I am from being pure in thy ſight. Shew me, Lord, how every thing I do is tainted with ſin, all polluted, all deficiency; and imperfections mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed every where. Turn to what duty I will, and I find it there, whether ſecret duties, public
<pb n="328" facs="unknown:035636_0165_1006155361E43560"/>
private, ſocial or relative. I have nothing to plead before God: I cannot be clean in his fight. I fly from all, to the blood and right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs of Chriſt; and there I will ſtand and lift up my head, not only at the throne of grace; but even at the bar of God. There I can look death, judgment and long eternity in the face without amazement; yea, with joy and tranſport.</p>
                     <p>O bleſſed be God for the great, the glorious atonement, made by the precious blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt for all the ſins that have attended my holy things! And for the ſake of the great a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement alone, they ſhall be accepted, yea, meet with reward of grace, notwithſtanding all that Satan can ſay. The Lord rebuke thee, Satan. I adore the grace which has enabled me, vile as I am, to feed the hungry and clothe the naked, deſtitute, fatherleſs ones—to labor to ſupport the goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt; and to refreſh occaſionally his dear miniſters and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. And I will plead for acceptance for his own name's ſake: For he has told me, A cup of cold water ſhall be accepted; and thoſe who give it in the name of a diſciple or a prophet, ſhall not loſe their reward. And I will hope in the mercy and free grace of God for accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of my poor labors of love, in educating the poor, from year to year; that I have been able to ſay, Silver and gold have I none; but ſuch as I have give I thee. And the Lord ſeal inſtruction, and make thoſe I have inſtructed a godly ſeed to ſerve the Lord, and inſtruments

                     <p>The Lord rebuke thee, Satan; for by the grace of God I am what I am; not ſuch a uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs creature as thou doſt inſinuate, though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed. Bleſſed be God for the teſtimony of my conſcience, that in ſimplicity and godly ſincerity I have had my converſation in this world renouncing evil, hating covetouſneſs, pride and unbelief; hating murmurings, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, diſtruſts of providence and grace; hating deceit, guile, ſloth and hypocriſy; yea, hating and groaning under the whole body of ſin, and contrariety to God and his holy, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious law: And I do delight in it, after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and long for conformity to it; yea, perfect conformity. And in the righteouſneſs of Chriſt I am complete; though not in my own; I own it to be imperfect and defiled; yet in the Beloved I am accepted: And, God helping me, I will cling there, and with Job I will hold my integrity, till I die. I am not wholly a hypocrite, though tainted with hypoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſy. The Lord rebuke thee, Satan, and in his own time deliver me from thee. And he will do it: For he has ſaid, I will never leave thee, nor forſake thee. And he never will. O now let me boldly ſay, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear. O my God, help me! All my ſufficiency is of thee. Make me humble and make me thankful; for I am thine forever.</p>

A ſweet ſatisfaction in a ſettled belief, that, however poor, ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted, ignorant mortals may, through frailty, have ſet their eyes too much on a worthleſs worm, God ſtands in no need of me. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever infinite love and wiſdom has deviſed, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite power will effect.

If it be his pleaſure, I ſhould yet ſerve him, and my generation according to his will, he will bring me back, reſtore health of body, and fortitude of mind, againſt Satan's wiles.

And now the artillery of heaven is diſplaying, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the arrows of the Almighty ſhould drink up my ſpirits in an inſtant; ſay, my ſluggiſh ſoul, art thou ready to appear before Jehovah's awful bar? Lord God, thou knoweſt; and I pray thee, let me not be deceived, if I anſwer in the affirmative. Let me with joy lift up my head, if my redemption from ſin is ſo near; if this poor, mean clog, my feeble body, will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt communion with God no more. Adieu, my dear companion! If it be the Lord's will, I bid thee a cheerful adieu, till the morning of a glorious reſurrection. I aſk not a moment's reprive, if it be my Lord's will to take me. O, if it might be his will to take me, and grant me the open viſion and full fruition of himſelf in glory!</p>
                     <p>But, my haſty ſoul, art thou ready? Thou polluted, thou imperfect one, Doſt thou know what a holy, ſin hating God he is, into whoſe preſence thou wouldeſt haſten? Whence this confidence of ſeeing his face with joy? Art thou ready? Say, Art thou indeed ready? Do not want to ruſh as a horſe into the battle. Art thou ready?—Alas! all my works are imperfect, and unfiniſhed; and will remain ſo, if I ſhould live to the age of Methuſelah: Yea, and I ſhall add ſin to ſin, againſt my gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious God, till death does ſtop me. Not till
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:035636_0171_1005EE002BD5A248"/>
then will my ſanctification be complete. But Chriſt has finiſhed all the work his Father gave him to do. He ſaid, It is finiſhed! The right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs he has wrought out is complete, and in him I ſtand complete. I have fled to it, I have laid hold on it; God has imputed it, and clothed me with it; and in it, I will cherfully venture through death, and to the judgment ſeat: For there Chriſt will openly acknowledge me. I have confeſſed him before men, and he will confeſs me before his Father, and his holy angels. The law and juſtice of God will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit me; for it is magnified, and fully ſatisfied; and there is no condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus. He is able to keep me from falling, ſhould God yet preſerve me in this life, and to preſent me faultleſs before the throne of God.</p>
                     <p>My ſoul, reſt ſecure in him, whether in life, or in death. Reach after as great degrees of conformity to the divine image, and reſignation to his will, as can be attained below; and bye and bye God will take thee. Wait his time, that is the beſt of all.</p>

                        <hi>Saturday morning, July</hi> 18.—Thanks be to God for the refreſhment of yeſterday morning; and laſt evening, while dear friends were here. Thanks be to God for the continuance of rain upon the thirſty earth. So water me this morning, I pray thee, by thy bleſſed Spirit. O Lord, ſince it is thy ſovereign pleaſure yet to hold me in life, I would delight to live, becauſe it is thy will: And renew my petition for grace to live to thy glory here. And, by grace, I
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:035636_0171_1005EE002BD5A248"/>
will wait all the days of my appointed time, till my great change come. It is with ſubmiſſion I aſk to depart; but encourage my importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for grace ſufficient for my day. I will with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the other requeſt. Though I long to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part and to be with Chriſt; yet this I would leave with infinite wiſdom; if it be expedient for any that I abide in the body. But to what end ſhould I live, if I live a cold, careleſs, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful life. Lord, how ſhall I glorify thee in life, if I remain ſo extreme unholy, ſo unlike to thee! If I backſlide yet more; play the harlot yet more: And my love to thee, and zeal for thy glory, and the good of precious immortals grow cold. O my God, ſhall I not thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor thee, and harden others hearts againſt thee! O, as ſure as God is in heaven, and I upon earth; ſo ſure I ſhall act this treacherous part, if thou doſt not ſtand by me, ſtrengthen and uphold me. O my God, leave me not a moment; for in that moment I fall. O help me to lay hold of thy ſtrength, and never let thee go, till I do derive from that infinite ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is in Chriſt Jeſus, grace ſufficient for every moment of life.</p>

                     <p>Let me hear thee pronounce the bleſſing on me; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="17"/> for fleſh and blood did not reveal this to me; but thy Father who is in heaven, by his Spirit, for the ſalvation of my poor ſoul.</p>

Lord, it is ſo little I can do; and that little ſo polluted with the dreadful nature of ſin, that I dare not plead any thing I have done, or ever can do. Yet make me more than ever ſincere, in aiming at doing as to thyſelf. Let love to thee be the motive and ſpring of all my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and then I ſhall never grudge my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt to any of thine.</p>

               <head>PART IV. The Concluſion of her Life.</head>
               <p>THE bodily infirmities of Mrs. Oſborn increaſed ſo much; and her eyeſight failed to ſuch a degree for above twenty years of the laſt part of her life, and her whole bodily frame was ſo weakened and worn out, that ſhe was obliged to give up her ſchool, and was not able to do any thing to ſupport herſelf. And as ſhe had nothing laid up to live upon, ſhe was wholly dependent on Divine Providence and her friends for daily ſupplies, during the whole of this time; and was, the greateſt part of it, confined to her room. This was in many reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects the happieſt part of her life. She was free from worldly anxiety and care. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed a calmneſs and ſerenity of mind, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of reſignation to God, and humble truſt and confidence in him, contented with the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotments of Divine Providence, ſeeing the hand of God in every thing which took place—con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly thankful to him for the mercies ſhe was daily and every hour receiving—full of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to thoſe whom God inclined to ſhow kindneſs to her—ſpending the chief of her time and ſtrength in devotion, in contemplating the divine perfections manifeſted in his works of
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:035636_0177_10061571E75FE520"/>
creation and providence, and in his word—a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doring and praiſing the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, praying to him for the church and the world; for her acquaintance, relations, friends, benefactors, and for herſelf; with conſtant, humble confeſſion of unworthineſs, aggravated ſins, and depravity of heart, making the daily occurrences reſpecting herſelf, and others, the matter of prayer and praiſe.</p>
               <p>She enjoyed an almoſt uninterrupted aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of her intereſt in the divine favor through Jeſus Chriſt, and longed to be perfectly holy. The thought of dying was pleaſing to her: And when any particular diſorder, or pain of body, came upon her, which ſeemed to indicate a ſpeedy diſſolution, it would commonly give a ſpring to her mind and excite pleaſure and joy. Thus ſhe appeared in this laſt part of her life in a meaſure to enjoy the happy conſequence and reward, of the ſore trials, labors and conflicts, through which ſhe had paſſed in former years. Something of which the reader has ſeen in that part of her diary which has been tranſcribed.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Oſborn often ſaid to her friends in this time, that ſhe conſidered her ſituation and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances in life, to be the beſt for her; and that ſhe knew of none, with whom ſhe could wiſh to exchange outward circumſtances, were it left to her option. She expreſſed a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſatisfaction in living ſenſibly dependent on the providence of God, for daily ſupplies for the body, living with God by the day, as ſhe uſed to expreſs it, having no ſtore of her own, and not able to do any thing to ſupply her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:035636_0178_100615738C61B168"/>
wants, and not knowing how and by whom they would be ſupplied, till it was ſent in to her, commonly in ways, and by perſons not thought of by her. This was ſuited to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a conſtant ſenſe of her dependence on God for daily and hourly ſupplies, and the exerciſe of truſt in him, and conſtant application to him, and acknowledgement and admiration of his goodneſs in ſupplying her wants, in a way and at times ſuited to diſcover his hand and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular care of her; and to excite her gratitude to her friends, and prayers for them, who ſent or brought to her the things ſhe wanted.</p>
               <p>In this manner ſhe lived more than twenty years, and often declared to her friends that her daily wants were fully ſupplied, and that ſhe was never deſtitute of the neceſſaries of life, and commonly had a fulneſs, and often abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Her wants were not great. She ſtood in need of daily food, waſhing, candle light, fire wood, and ſome clothing, and money to pay the rent of her houſe, which was five dollars every three months. All theſe wants were conſtantly ſupplied, while no particular perſon was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to do it; ſo that ſhe had none to depend upon but God. While the Britiſh had poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Rhodeiſland in the time of the war, which was near three years, the inhabitants of Newport were driven to great ſtraights, by the ſcarcity of proviſion, fuel, &amp;c. and many ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a great degree. Mrs. Oſborn lived in a great degree of quiet, and had a conſtant ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of the neceſſaries of life; and received no abuſe from the Britiſh officers or ſoldiers, as
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:035636_0178_100615738C61B168"/>
moſt others did. Though a number of ſoldiers were quartered near the houſe in which ſhe lived, none were obtruded on her, as they were on others. And as to thoſe who were quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed near her; it was remarked by her and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that they made leſs diſturbance and noiſe, than they did elſewhere; and were particularly careful not to do any thing on the Sabbath to diſturb that <hi>good woman,</hi> as they called her. And they took care to avoid all profa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e words when near her. Which ſhe uſed to mention afterwards to her friends, as a remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the tender care and protection of heaven.</p>
               <p>In the year 1778, while the Britiſh ſoldiers had poſſeſſion of Newport, Mr. Oſborn, her huſband, died; and a grand daughter of his, with her huſband, who lived in her houſe, on whom ſhe had ſome dependence for protection and aſſiſtance, moved into the country, by which ſhe appeared more deſtitute and expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, than before, being left <hi>alone.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In this time of particular danger and trial, Mrs. MASON, a perſon who gave good evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that ſhe was a real friend to Chriſt, and to his followers, manifeſted peculiar friendſhip and generoſity towards her, by her conſtant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to her, and ſupplying many of her wants; and continued her ſpecial kindneſs in miniſtering to her as long as ſhe (Mrs. Maſon) lived, which ſhe did till March, 1792. Mrs. Orſborn often ſaid, that Mrs. Maſon never failed her in one inſtance, as a peculiar friend and conſtant benefactor, to the day of her
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:035636_0179_10061575FB270D18"/>
death. We have no reaſon to doubt that they, both the giver and the receiver, are peculiarly happy together now; and that the former is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded a thouſand fold for all her kindneſs to the latter, as a dear diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt. Others have diſtinguiſhed themſelves in their kindneſs to Mrs. Oſborn in miniſtering to her, whom it is improper to mention, as they are yet alive. We have the pleaſure of being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured that they, and all who have miniſtered to her, <hi>becauſe ſhe belonged to Chriſt,</hi> will have an ample reward at the reſurrection of the juſt.</p>
               <p>There was ſomething peculiar and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary in her being able punctually to pay the rent of her houſe in this time, which is worthy of particular mention. She depended wholly upon the unſolicited benefactions of her friends for this, as ſhe did for her daily ſupport. And no one was engaged to aſſiſt her in doing this, or to take any care about it. She had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no particular perſon to look to for it, or to make up any deficiency by which ſhe ſhould be unable to pay what was due at the end of each quarter. It was therefore a very preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious matter, to human appearance, whether, when ſhe had paid the rent of one quarter, ſhe ſhould ever be able to pay another. She could not conjecture from whence it would come, as ſhe had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e to look to for it, but that God, whoſe is the world, and the fulneſs thereof. Her intimate friends were ſometimes concerned for her, when her quarter was near at an end, and ſhe had received but part of the five dollars which would be ſoon due, and there was a
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:035636_0179_10061575FB270D18"/>
great ſcarc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ty of money, and all appearances that ſhe would not be able to pay. When this was ſuggeſted to her, ſhe would reply nearly in the following words. "I deſire to be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to God, I do not feel in the leaſt anxious about it. I do not doubt of my having the whole of the money at the time in which it will be due, or near it. God has given me a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and earneſt deſire to do juſtice, and pay when any thing is due. This is a juſt debt, and God has been pleaſed hitherto to gratify me by enabling me to pay, when it is due; and I believe he will ſtill continue to do it. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I ſhall not live to the end of the quarter. I ſhall then leave enough to pay this debt. I deſire to leave it with God." She generally had the money in her hand by the time it was due, and never failed being able to pay with punctuality. She frequently did not receive much, if any part of the money, till juſt before the quarter was ended, and knew not from whom, or from whence it would come; yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the time to pay came, as much as was neceſſary to anſwer her end at that time, would be brought or ſent to her, by perſons who knew nothing of her preſent ſtrait. And it was often ſent by perſons who lived at a diſtance, which would come to her juſt at the time in which it was wanted. She had money ſent her from Quebec, from the Weſt Indies, and from vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parts of the United States.</p>
               <p>This is related as a remarkable inſtance of humble truſt in God, and reſignation and acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſcence in his will; and of the tender care
<pb n="358" facs="unknown:035636_0180_1006157A06473168"/>
and faithfulneſs of God, and loving kindneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one devoted to his ſervice, and truſting in his promiſes: And that it may ſerve as an example and encouragement to all, to "truſt in the Lord, at all times, and pour out their hearts before him."</p>
               <p>Mrs. Orſborn was, in the laſt twenty years of her life, ſtripped, by degrees, and deprived of many privileges and enjoyments, which to her had been very great and precious. She had eſteemed public worſhip, attending on the preaching of the goſpel and public inſtitutions, as far more deſirable and important than all worldly good, in attending on which ſhe had great enjoyment. But her bodily infirmities were ſo great and increaſing, that for near twenty years ſhe was unable to attend public worſhip. Her eyes failed her to ſuch a degree, that ſhe was obliged to lay by her pen, not being able to write any thing conſiderable, which ſhe had done before this with great pleaſure and profit to herſelf, having written more than fifty volumes, the leaſt containing near 100 pages, the bigger part above 200, and a number 300, and more, beſides letters to her friends, and other occaſional writing. The failing of her ſight alſo deprived her of the pleaſure and profit of <hi>reading</hi>; eſpecially of reading the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, which ſhe had before daily peruſed with great pleaſure and advantage. She had the Bible, indeed, read to her daily; which ſhe conſidered as an unſpeakable favor. But this did not equal the privilege of being able to have acceſs to it, at all times, and on every
<pb n="359" facs="unknown:035636_0180_1006157A06473168"/>
particular occaſion. But ſhe paid ſuch atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Bible, read it ſo much, and ſo trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured it up in her memory, while ſhe could read, that ſhe found great pleaſure and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit in being able to recollect ſo much of it, when ſhe was not able to read; which ſhe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently mentioned to her friends, as matter of thankfulneſs.</p>
               <p>The religious meetings in the room where ſhe lived, which have been mentioned, of the church, of the female ſociety, and occaſional meetings for prayer of a number of profeſſors of religion, which ſhe conſidered as a great priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ilege, were continued as long as ſhe was able to bear them, partly for her ſake. But at length her infirmities were ſo great that ſhe was obliged to relinquiſh this enjoyment. And ſhe became ſo weak that ſhe could not bear lengthy viſits of her friends, in which ſhe uſed to take a peculiar pleaſure. Her moſt intimate friends could only have ſhort interviews with her at different times. But while ſhe found herſelf thus deprived of theſe privileges and her precious enjoyments, one after another, ſhe remained calm and reſigned in a ſenſe of her unworthineſs of them, and deſert of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely greater evils; and conſtantly expreſſed her thankfulneſs for the privileges and favors ſhe yet enjoyed; particularly that God had not taken himſelf from her; but indulged her with ſuch a degree of free acceſs to him, and ſuch enjoyment of him in views of his glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and works, eſpecially his love and grace in the glorious work of redemption,
<pb n="360" facs="unknown:035636_0181_1006157B916E0170"/>
which more than made up for all that was taken from her. She enjoyed the almoſt uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted light of God's countenance, and ſpent moſt of her time and ſtrength in devotion, in prayer and praiſe, in which ſhe had unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble delight, and a rich foretaſte of heaven. She uſed to ſay, ſhe had learned to conſider and hold her neareſt friends, as well as all worldly enjoyments, as a cloak or looſe garment, which ſhe was ready to have taken off and laid aſide, whenever there was occaſion for it.</p>
               <p>Some years before her death, ſhe ſaid to her friends, ſhe thought the time was now come for them, and all who knew her, to be quite willing that ſhe ſhould leave the world; for ſhe was become uſeleſs in all reſpects, and was only a charge and burden to thoſe by whom her bodily wants were ſupplied. She was told, that all her friends deſired that her life might be yet continued, if conſiſtent with the divine will, as ſhe was far from being uſeleſs, as we had her prayers for her friends; for the church and congregation to which ſhe belonged; for all the people and churches of Chriſt, and his intereſt and kingdom in the world, &amp;c. And when her acquaintance, and, particularly, the congregation of which ſhe was a member, thought of her, as being alive in her room, which probably moſt of them often did, it was attended with an idea and feeling, which tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their good, and which they could not have, if ſhe were not in the world. And as to thoſe who miniſtered to her ſupport and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, they enjoyed a privilege and ſatisfaction
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:035636_0181_1006157B916E0170"/>
in it, inſtead of its being an undeſirable burden, which they could not have, if ſhe were not here in juſt ſuch circumſtances. And they who did this to her, becauſe ſhe belonged to Chriſt, had opportunity hereby to exerciſe chriſtian charity, and expreſs their love to Chriſt, for all which they would be abundantly rewarded in his eternal kingdom. Her reply was to this purpoſe. "If this be ſo, and I can be in any reſpect and degree uſeful in my ſituation and circumſtances, I am willing to continue in the body; but to depart and be with Chriſt is far better. I deſire to leave it all with God, and am willing to live or die, juſt as he pleaſes."</p>
               <p>Some months before her deceaſe her diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of body appeared to increaſe; her ſtrength failed her more and more, and ſhe became dropſical, and was at times in great diſtreſs for want of breath. She conſidered herſelf as now ſoon <hi>going home,</hi> as ſhe expreſſed it, and wiſhed for patience to wait till the appointed time of her departure ſhould come, and to bear what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever bodily diſtreſs God was pleaſed to lay upon her. She deſired her friends to pray for her, that ſhe might have faith and patience to the end of life, and, in no reſpect, conduct ſo as to be a diſgrace to the religion which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, and put her chriſtian friends to ſhame on her account: But that ſhe might glorify God, and ſpeak, and conduct worthy of her high and holy calling, to her laſt breath.</p>
               <p>In a ſketch of Mrs. Oſborn's character, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in the Theological Magazine, No. 1.
<pb n="362" facs="unknown:035636_0182_1006157D2DDAD888"/>
Vol. II, is the following paragraph, written by one who viſited her often in her laſt ſickneſs.</p>
               <p>"As ſhe drew near the cloſe of life, ſhe was a proof of the ſtrength and hope of the righteous; was an inſtance of the myſterious example of flouriſhing virtue, with the decays of nature: Of ſatisfaction in the proſpect of future good, when from the world ſhe could derive no pleaſure. My phyſician," ſhe ſaid, "has ſeriouſly intimated, that I cannot live <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ng; but I am not alarmed. Unleſs my heart deceive me, and <hi>the heart is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked</hi>; but unleſs mine <hi>greatly</hi> deceive me, I have no reaſon to be apprehenſive for the future ſtate. It appears to be the will of God that I ſhould go hence. I ought to ſubmit to his will, and I do, with cheerfulneſs. May his will be done." In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſeaſon, ſhe ſaid, "The trials of my ſituation are great; to be in want of breath, is very diſtreſſing; pray for me, that I may have patience and reſignation: I deſire them above all things. O pray for me that, in theſe laſt hours of my life, I may not cauſe you all to bluſh that I have profeſſed chriſtianity." It being remarked, that God was faithful, and would never forſake thoſe who had loved and ſerved him. "Yes," ſhe replied, "I know, by experience, that he is a faithful covenant keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and he will never leave thoſe who love and ſerve him; though without his grace I ſhould immediately ſink, and my mind be filled with darkneſs and repining." In this temper of humility and reliance on God, ſhe
<pb n="363" facs="unknown:035636_0182_1006157D2DDAD888"/>
continued, and gave no ſign of impatience, more than ſaying, a day or two before her death, when ſhe heard the bell toll, that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body had got the ſtart of her."</p>
               <p>She continued to ſink by degrees, till after a diſtreſſing turn, ſhe appeared more comfortable, and they who attended her, helped her to lie down, at her deſire, hoping ſhe might get ſome reſt and ſleep. They left her for a few minutes, and when they returned, they found her breath was gone, and ſhe a lifeleſs corpſe! Thus ſhe left the world, and paſſed that death which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> had ſo often and ſo long deſired, calm and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene, without the leaſt perceivable ſtruggle or groan, and, we doubt not, entered into that reſt to which the righteous go, on the 2d day of Auguſt, 1796, in the 83d year of her age. Her funeral was attended on the 4th day of Auguſt, by an uncommon concourſe of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. The corpſe was carried into the meeting houſe, and a funeral ſermon was preached, from Epheſians iv.1. <hi>I therefore, the priſoner of the Lord, beſeech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE Memoirs will be concluded by mentioning a number of particulars of her chriſtian character, in which Mrs. Orſborn was eminent, and worthy of imitation, which have been in ſome meaſure brought into view in the foregoing narrative, and the extracts from her diary; and appear in a more clear and ſtriking

light to thoſe who have peruſed the whole of her writings, or had a particular and intimate acquaintance with her.</p>
               <p>She was ſenſibly and ſtrongly devoted to the glory of God, and conſcientiouſly ſought to honor him in all her ways. She was tenderly concerned, and careful to do and ſay nothing which had the leaſt perceivable tendency to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>onor him, and conſtantly watched againſt every thing of that kind. She deſired nothing for herſelf or others, and that nothing might take place, but what was conſiſtent with the higheſt diſplay of the divine glory; and it was matter of conſtant joy to her, that God was able and would ſecure his own honor, and make the brighteſt manifeſtation of his own glorious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and would ſuffer nothing to take place but that which ſhould be for his glory; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore would cauſe even thoſe things and events, which, in themſelves appeared to have a tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to the contrary, to be the occaſion of a more clear diſcovery of his moſt amiable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous character. She had an affecting and ſtrong abhorrence of every thing which ſhe ſaw in herſelf, even all moral depravity; and which appeared in others, as having a tendency to diſhonor God. This was a conſtant ſource of grief and trouble to her. By this ſhe mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted a high degree of diſintereſted, benevolent love to God, and was more conformed than moſt profeſſing chriſtians appear to be, to that apoſtolic injunction, "Whether therefore ye eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God."</p>
               <p>

For this ſhe prayed, and rejoiced when ſhe found others engaged and united in this, and when there was any appearance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival of religion, and of the converſion of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or heard of any thing of this kind in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant places. She earneſtly ſought the ſalvation and temporal good of all whom ſhe knew, and with whom ſhe had any connection; and their circumſtances, and the events reſpecting them, whether proſperous or adverſe, affected her, which conſtantly afforded her matter of prayer and praiſe, while ſhe endeavored to conduct towards all, and treat them ſo in all reſpects as to recommend religion to them, and perſuade them to embrace and practiſe it.</p>
               <p>She practiſed ſecret devotions at ſtated times, unleſs prevented by ſome unavoidable inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; in which ſhe ſpent conſiderable time every day, in reading the Bible, ſerious medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and prayer, in which ſhe had, eſpecially at times, great enlargement and delight. And when ſhe had no ſenſible acceſs to God, ſhe could have but little comfort and enjoyment in any thing. Her mind was frequently and almoſt conſtantly exerciſed in devotion by pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ejaculations, when in company, or attending to her daily buſineſs.</p>
               <p>She was a great friend to family religion, to have ſome portion of the Bible read, and prayer attended in the family, in the morning
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:035636_0184_10061583DF248CA8"/>
and evening; and took care to have all her family preſent, and that they ſhould behave with decency. And when no man was preſent, ſhe thought it her duty to pray with her family herſelf.</p>
               <p>She had a great veneration and love for the chriſtian Sabbath, and public worſhip. This was a high day with her; and ſhe commonly had great enjoyment in attending public prayers, ſinging, and hearing the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and eſpecially in attending the Lord's Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; for which ſhe was careful and ſolemn in preparations, and ſelf examination. She uſed to recollect the particular heads of the public diſcourſes for her own improvement in her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, and often committed them to writing, with her reflections on them. She was care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to prepare for the Sabbath, by ordering her family affairs ſo as not to be led by them to intrude upon the Sabbath, or be any diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to her devotions. And after ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and could not attend public worſhip, ſhe took ſpecial care not to attend to any thing on the day before the Sabbath, which might in any reſpect unfit her for the private duties of the Sabbath, wiſhing to reſerve all her ſtrength of body and mind for the exerciſes of that high day. And though ſhe could not enjoy bodily attendance on public worſhip; yet in her ſpirit ſhe was preſent with the worſhipping aſſemblies of chriſtians; eſpecially with that to which ſhe had a more particular relation, ſo as to have a peculiar enjoyment in her attending to them, and joining with them in her mental exerciſes.
<pb n="367" facs="unknown:035636_0184_10061583DF248CA8"/>
In this reſpect ſhe received great benefit by public worſhip, and doubtleſs had more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit and enjoyment from it, than many, if not the moſt, received, who were allowed to attend conſtantly. She was ſo inquiſitive to know what were the ſubjects of the public diſcourſes, that ſhe would be informed what they were to be, before they were delivered, or ſoon after, and ſhe would attend to them, and ſo feaſt upon the truths contained in them, that her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment and profit by them appeared far to exceed that which moſt who heard them in public obtained.</p>
               <p>The following extract of a letter which ſhe wrote to a friend, is inſerted here, as an illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of the above. Speaking of her being deprived of the enjoyment of public worſhip, by bodily infirmity, ſhe ſaid, "My Lord's days' enjoyments, ſince my confinement, have been better felt than expreſſed. Perhaps my exerciſes never were higher, when worſhipping in God's own houſe, nor even at the Redeemer's table: Never felt a dearer union with the people of God; that oneneſs which cannot be expreſſed. Nor had ſtronger deſires excited by the Spirit of God for Zion's proſperity; and the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſin and Satan, and advancement of Chriſt's cauſe and kingdom: Nor ſtronger de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to help my dear miniſter while he was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in the Lord's work; to be permitted to hold up his hands, that Amalek may not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, but the work of the Lord proſper in his hands. The ſweet delight I have in realizing that the dear ſheep and lambs of Chriſt's fold
<pb n="368" facs="unknown:035636_0185_10061585764EB1D8"/>
are feeding on the goſpel dainties, is not eaſily deſcribed. I am indeed a partaker with them, though abſent in body. And God ſo bleſſeth ſomething repeated to me from the ſermons, that I retain and feed more on the precious truths all the week, than I have been able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, when I have heard the whole. Thus, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe akin to the glorious Jeſus, I dwell in Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhen, though not in the King's court, or at his table. And dare I be reſtleſs and complain, becauſe I cannot go out? No, no! The will of the Lord be done. I ſtand amazed at his gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle dealings with ſuch a monſter of iniquity!"</p>
               <p>She was not talkative; yet affable and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in converſation, and when in company with her friends and acquaintance, ſhe had an aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to vain, trifling converſation. And if at any time it took place, ſhe would generally at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to divert it to ſomething ſerious and profitable. If in any inſtance ſhe neglected this, and in any degree joined with them, and ſpoke any thing which on reflection ſhe thought to be too light and unprofitable, ſhe would with ſorrow condemn and humble herſelf before God. Her chief enjoyment in company was with her chriſtian friends; and when ſhe was with them and little or no religious converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion took place, it would be matter of grief, ſhame and lamentation to her. Few have their tongues ſo much under a bridle, as ſhe had; yet ſhe often lamented that it was not more ſo.</p>
               <p>She had a deep, abiding, and increaſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and ſenſe of the evil of ſin, as being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity againſt God, and all that is truly good;
<pb n="369" facs="unknown:035636_0185_10061585764EB1D8"/>
and of the exceeding depravity and wickedneſs of her own heart, and felt herſelf wholly undone and loſt, if left to herſelf; that ſhe deſerved to be caſt off and made miſerable forever, and that God would be moſt juſt in caſting her into endleſs deſtruction; that ſhe depended wholly for ſalvation on the ſovereign mercy of Him, who has mercy on whom he will have mercy; that a heart to embrace the goſpel, and every degree of right exerciſe of heart was the gift of God, of which ſhe was infinitely unworthy; and that ſhe depended on the ſame ſovereign grace for the continuance in the exerciſe of grace; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o be kept from falling, and to be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in holineſs. She therefore truſted in Chriſt alone as her redeemer and ſanctifier. He was infinitely honorable, excellent and precious in her ſight, on whoſe atonement, merit, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wiſdom and power ſhe relied, as every way ſufficient for her pardon and complete ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This is abundantly expreſſed in her dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. She felt the power of theſe truths to form her to a willing obedience to Chriſt, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to deſire perfect conformity to the holy law of God, and his moral image and character, knowing that ſhe could not be completely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py till ſhe awaked in the likeneſs of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>She highly eſteemed thoſe who appeared the true miniſters of the goſpel, for their work's ſake, and was liberal in her contributions for the ſupport of public worſhip and the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the goſpel, knowing it was ordained by Chriſt, that they who preach the goſpel, ſhould live of the goſpel. It is known that in this
<pb n="370" facs="unknown:035636_0186_100615870384FC58"/>
matter ſhe was willing to her power, and even beyond it; and that ſhe often gave more to this end, than many wealthy perſons of the ſame congregation. And ſhe uſed her influence to excite others <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o contribute. And when ſhe was wholly dependent on her friends for a ſupport, and unable to attend public worſhip, if ſhe had more given to her than ſhe want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for her preſent ſupply and comfort, ſhe would give a part of it for the ſupport of the goſpel; and would ſay, ſhe preſumed her friends who kindly miniſtered for the ſupply of her wants would be willing that ſhe ſhould have the ſatisfaction of contributing her two mites for the ſupport of the goſpel miniſtry, when ſhe had any thing to ſpare.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Oſborn had an uncommon concern to do juſtice to all with whom ſhe had any deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, in all reſpects, both in the ſight of men, and before God. In this ſhe was conſcientious, and conſtantly exerciſed herſelf with great care and circumſpection to have a conſcience void of offence towards men, always keeping what ſhe called the golden rule in her view, deſiring to do to others, as ſhe would they ſhould do to her. This appears in a clear and ſtriking light in her diary.</p>
               <p>And ſhe not only did juſtice, but loved mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. She gladly embraced every opportunity to relieve the wants and diſtreſſes of others, when in her power, and would often run ventures, and ſtrip herſelf of what ſhe really wanted, to relieve others who appeared to her to be in greater want. When ſhe was dependent on
<pb n="371" facs="unknown:035636_0186_100615870384FC58"/>
others for ſupport, and ſhe had any thing in her hand which ſhe could ſpare, ſhe took delight in relieving the poor in diſtreſs, knowing that her benefactors were willing ſhe ſhould enjoy this pleaſure, which was much greater to her, than to uſe it for herſelf. In this way ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways laying up a treaſure in heaven, and became rich towards God.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Oſborn was a kind and <hi>faithful</hi> friend. She was a true friend to all, even to thoſe who acted an unfriendly part to her, and injured her. But her heart was united in a peculiar manner and degree to thoſe who appeared to be friends to Chriſt. Theſe were her choſen aſſociates and companions, in whom ſhe had great delight. And all her chriſtian friends might place the greateſt confidence in her, and uſe the utmoſt freedom without giving offence; and truſt any ſecret with her, with the greateſt ſafety, without the leaſt fear of being betrayed, or that it would be communicated to any one. She had a number of intimate friends, with whom ſhe converſed with great openneſs, free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and pleaſure, finding, on acquaintance, that ſhe could ſafely rely on their candor, friendſhip, prudence and fidelity. Among theſe Miſs Suſa Anthony, whoſe life has lately been publiſhed, was the firſt, and her greateſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, whom ſhe highly eſteemed and loved, as an eminent chriſtian, of uncommon diſcerning and judgment; and whom ſhe found to be a moſt faithful, prudent friend, at all times. There was a diſtinguiſhed and eminently chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian and happy friendſhip enjoyed and cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="372" facs="unknown:035636_0187_10061588B71F5018"/>
between them, for about fifty years, without any interruption, and to their great mutual comfort and helpfulneſs.—They were truly, and in a diſtinguiſhed degree, of one heart and one ſoul, and during the whole time loved each other with a pure heart, fervently. It is not known or believed that there is to be found, or has been in this century ſuch a union and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py chriſtian friendſhip between two ſuch emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent chriſtians, for ſo long a time, as took place in this inſtance. What fervent prayers and praiſes did they pour out before God for each other, when ſeparate! What hearty and ſweet counſel did they take together, giving mutual advice and aſſiſtance, under their various trials, burdens, difficulties and doubts, while they o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened their hearts and feelings, in full confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in each other! With what fervor, freedom and pleaſure, did they two join in devotion, by pouring out their hearts before God, when they had opportunities! With what high delight and rapture have they met among the ſpirits of the juſt made perfect, where, free from all ſin and ſorrow, their long continued friendſhip in this world, is made perfect with an aſſurance that it will increaſe in happineſs and laſt forever, in the favor and preſence of Him, whom they love with all their hearts, and is their everlaſting portion! Here we are loſt, and muſt wait till the curtain of mortality be dropped, to have a perfect knowledge and enjoyment of that felic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and glory of which we have now ideas ſo dark and very imperfect. Bleſſed are they
<pb n="373" facs="unknown:035636_0187_10061588B71F5018"/>
who are not ſlothful, but followers of them, who, through faith and patience, now inherit the promiſes!</p>
               <p>AFTER Mrs. Oſborn had laid by her pen for a number of years, through the defect of her eye ſight, and debility of body and mind, her thoughts unaccountably turned upon meditating on divine ſubjects, in verſe or rhyme. This increaſed upon her, ſo that ſhe made verſes on a number of ſubjects; and her memory retained them, while they were not written, ſo that ſhe could rehearſe them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, when ſhe pleaſed; which ſhe did to ſome of her intimate friends. They were pleaſed with them, not for their elegance and poetry; for to this ſhe made no pretenſion; but for the ſentiments, as expreſſed by <hi>her,</hi> and flowing from her heart, without any ſpeculative ſtudy: And ſome of them were written from her mouth.</p>
               <p>Her mind became more and more engaged in this way, which ſhe found to be entertaining and profitable to herſelf. At length ſhe thought of attempting to reſume her pen, and write her verſes on ſeveral ſubjects, though ſhe knew ſhe was not a poet, and had never before attempted any thing of the kind. She found herſelf able to write, beyond any thing ſhe, or her friends, had ever expected, and wrote ſo much on a number of ſubjects, many of which ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="374" facs="unknown:035636_0188_1006158B353F5130"/>
compoſed in her mind, and retained in her memory, that, if collected together, they would make a conſiderable volume.</p>
               <p>As this was, in ſeveral reſpects, an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary event, and theſe writings expreſs the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout exerciſes of her heart, in a manner differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from her diary, the following is here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted as a ſpecimen of the whole.</p>
