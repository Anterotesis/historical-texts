            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THAT the establishment of useful manufactures tendeth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the enriching of that country where they are insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted, is a truth, evidently demonstrated among all industrious societies.</p>
            <p>MANY trading nations have constructed paper to such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that it hath become a staple commodity; the exportati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which daily produceth great emoluments to their traders and manufacturers.—The parliament of Ireland, being intent upon establishing the paper manufactory in that kingdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed as a free gift the sum of <hi>five hundred</hi> pounds to an Artist, to encourage him to exert his utmost abilities in prosecuting the business of Paper-making towards perfection.</p>
            <p>THE success of the Paper Manufactory is so closely connected with the grand Art of Printing, which elevateth and refineth the human mind, that every encouragement extended to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the publication of New Books, are strong and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most irresistable incitements to extensive improvements in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing of Paper.—The Legislators of Pennsylvania have it entirely in their power, without having recourse to expensive gratuities, but merely by the abrogation of one clause in an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquated Act which preventeth the free sale of Books by Auction in the city of Philadelphia, made in the youth of this province, before the consumption of Books was ever suspected to amount to a staple commodity in which thousands of pounds might be employed to the advantage of the community in general, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to the benefit of many industrious individuals.</p>
            <p>THOSE who have not had the opportunity of entering into the arcana of Bookselling, are requested to lend their attention to the following state of the trade. Suppose a bookseller in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia intendeth to print an edition of CHAMBERS'S UNIVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SAL DICTIONARY of ARTS and SCIENCES, with the SUPPLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MENT, in four volumes folio.—To defray the very great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of Paper, Printing, and Binding, and to be enabled to afford this valuable work at a moderate price to the purchasers, it is necessary that the bookseller should risk the cost of printing three thousand copies.—Although soon after they are print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he may discover that he hath finished a larger number than he can find purchasers for.—After waiting two or three years for the expected purchasers, the bookseller is convinced he was mistaken in the calculation of his customers, and then he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineth, according to the mode practised in all other countries when an edition hath been over-printed, to sell them by Auction to those inhabitants who choose to purchase in that way. These sales by Auction, although at an under price, realizeth dead stock into live CASH, and will sooner enable him to repair with ready money to the Paper Manufacturers, in order to make ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt upon some celebrated author, whose sublime works might diffuse universal knowledge to every corner of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can continent;—but this at present a bookseller is not permitted to do in the city of Philadelphia.—The above example, by a variation of the number, may be applied to the printing of all Books whatsoever.—And this hinderance to the sale of Books by Auction in this city, so long as it is continued, will operate as an embargo to prevent the adventuring booksellers from the print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many useful and instructive Books, which might both illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the minds, and illustrate the pockets of many members of the community.</p>
            <p>THE exhibition of these facts before the judicious, who know, that reading is the only fund of pleasure which is inexhaustible, may perhaps be attended with some salutary consequences. And as a farther investigation of this literary inquiry in which the public are deeply interested, the Publisher taketh the liberty of producing a paper from the much esteemed Spectator, by the celebrated Joseph Addison, who had no pecuniary motives to prompt him to expatiate upon the grandeur and utility of the paper and printing manufactures.</p>

            </q>
            <p>I HAVE often pleased myself with considering the two kinds of benefits which accrue to the publick from these my specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and which, were I to speak after the manner of logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, I would distinguish into the <hi>material</hi> and the <hi>formal.</hi> By the latter I understand those advantages which my readers receive, as their minds are either improv'd or delighted by these my daily labours; but having already several times descanted on my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in this light, I shall at present wholly confine myself to the consideration of the former. By the word <hi>material</hi> I mean those benefits which arise to the publick from these my speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as they consume a considerable quantity of our paper ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture, employ our artisans in printing, and find business for great numbers of indigent persons.</p>
            <p>OUR paper manufacture takes into it several mean materials which could be put to no other use, and affords work for several hands in the collecting of them, which are incapable of any other employment. Those poor retailers, whom we see so busy in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry street, deliver in their respective gleanings to the merchant. The merchant carries them in loads to the paper-mill, where they pass thro' a fresh set of hands, and give life to another trade. Those who have mills on their estates, by this means consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably raise their rents, and the whole nation is in a great measure supplied with a manufacture, for which formerly she was obliged to her neighbours.</p>
            <p>THE materials are no sooner wrought into paper, but they are distributed among the presses, where they again set innumerable artists at work, and furnish business to another mystery. From hence, accordingly as they are stain'd with news or politicks, they fly thro' the town in <hi>post men, post boys, daily courants, reviews, medleys,</hi> and <hi>examiners</hi> Men, women, and children contend who shall be the first bearers of them, and get their daily sustenance by spreading them. In short, when I trace in my mind a bun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of rags to a quire of <hi>spectators,</hi> I find so many hands employ'd in every step they take thro' their whole progress, that while I am writing a <hi>spectator,</hi> I fancy myself providing bread for a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>IF I do not take care to obviate some of my witty readers, they will be apt to tell me, that my paper, after it is thus print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and published, is still beneficial to the publick on several occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. I must confess I have lighted my pipe with my own works for this twelve-month past: My landlady often sends up her lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle daughter to desire some of my old <hi>spectators,</hi> and has frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly told me, that the paper they are printed on is the best in the world to wrap spice in. They likewise make a good foundation for a mutton pye, as I have more than once experienced, and were very much sought for last <hi>Christmas</hi> by the whole neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.</p>
            <p>IT is pleasant enough to consider the changes that a linea fragment undergoes, by passing thro' the several hands above-mentioned. The finest pieces of holland, when worn to tatters, assume a new whiteness more beautiful than their first, and often return in the shape of letters to their native country. A lady's shift may be metamorphosed into billets-doux, and come into her possession a second time. A beau may peruse his cravat after it is worn out, with greater pleasure and advantage than ever he did in a glass. In a word, a piece of cloth, after having offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for some years as a towel or a napkin, may by this means be raised from a dunghill, and become the most valuable piece of furniture in a prince's cabinet.</p>
            <p>THE politest nations of <hi>Europe</hi> have endeavoured to vie with one another for the reputation of the finest printing: Absolute governments, as well as republicks, have encouraged an art which seems to be the noblest and most beneficial that ever was invented among the sons of men. The present king of <hi>France,</hi> in his pursuits after glory, has particularly distinguished himself by the promoting of this useful art, insomuch that several books have been printed in the <hi>Louvre</hi> at his own expence, upon which he sets so great a value, that he considers them as the noblest presents he can make to foreign princes and ambassadors. If we look into the commonwealths of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> we shall find that in this particular they have made themselves the envy of the greatest monarchies. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and <hi>Aldus</hi> are more frequently mentioned than any pensioner of the one or doge of the other.</p>
            <p>THE several presses which are now in <hi>England,</hi> and the great encouragement which has been given to learning for some years last past, has made our own nation as glorious upon this account, as for its late triumphs and conquests. The new edition which is given us of <hi>Caesar's</hi> commentaries, has already been taken notice of in foreign <hi>Gazettes,</hi> and is a work that does honour to the <hi>English</hi> press. It is no wonder that an edition should be very correct, which has passed thro the hands of one of the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate, learned, and judicious writers this age has produced. The beauty of the paper, of the character, and of the several <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> with which this noble work is illustrated, makes it the finest book that I have ever seen; and is a true instance of the <hi>English</hi> genius, which, tho' it does not come the first into any art, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally carries it to greater heights than any other country in the world. I am particularly glad that this author <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> from a <hi>British</hi> printing house in so great a magnificence, as he is the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> who has given us any tolerable account of our country.</p>
            <p>MY illiterate readers, if any such there are, will be surprised to hear me talk of learning as the glory of a nation, and of printing as an art that gains reputation to a people among whom it flourishes. When men's thoughts are taken up with avarice and ambition, they cannot look upon any thing as great or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, which does not bring with it an extraordinary power or interest to the person who is concerned in it. But as I shall never sink this paper so far as to engage with Goths and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, I shall only regard such kind of reasoners with that pity which is due to so deplorable a degree of stupidity and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</p>
