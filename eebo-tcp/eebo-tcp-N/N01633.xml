            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>HAVING been favour'd with the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Enſuing <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> I deſire heartily to bleſs GOD, who has gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly directed and led his <hi>Servant</hi> into, and aſſiſted him in the <hi>Compoſing</hi> it, and inclin'd him to <hi>Publiſh</hi> it. The <hi>Subject</hi> is certainly the beſt choſen that can be for Univerſal and perpetual <hi>Uſe</hi> to Souls, both for the Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and Converting <hi>Sinners,</hi> and the quickning of <hi>Saints.</hi> The Deſign of this <hi>Epiſtolary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> is, if it may pleaſe God, to impreſs the <hi>Readers</hi> Soul with a ſerious Conſideration of the <hi>Importance</hi> of the great and neceſſary <hi>Truths</hi> here prepared for him, and to beſpeak a very <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Attention</hi> to them while he reads them. For how <hi>awful,</hi> affecting and awakening ſhou'd it be to Mankind to hear of that <hi>Great and Glorious Salvation revealed and offered to Sinners in and by the Goſpel, and the great and unavoidable Miſery which the Neglect of it will bring upon us.</hi> This Great Subject
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:001939_0003_0FBA2670D55DB230"/>
is here handled in the moſt plain and ſerious <hi>manner,</hi> with a pure Aim and ſincere Zeal (to make the moſt <hi>upright Judgment of Charity</hi> I am able to form) to inform the Minds and enter into the Conſciences of Men.</p>
            <p>Sinners are here ſhewn the <hi>Need</hi> they ſtand in of Salvation; the <hi>Way</hi> of Salvation is opened; the great and glorious <hi>Nature</hi> of the offer'd Salvation is conſidered; the <hi>proneneſs</hi> which there is in Men to neglect it is diſcovered; the <hi>actual</hi> neglect of it among Men is lamented; and the great and <hi>unavoidable Miſery</hi> which this Neglect will bring upon Men is faithfully and ſolemnly declared. Theſe great Things (which are the <hi>whole of Man</hi> and the <hi>one thing needful)</hi> are here diſcours'd in a Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and rational manner; and the whole <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument</hi> is manag'd in a Method and Stile very ſolid and judicious, clear and diſtinct, earneſt and moving; ſuch as the Weight, Gravity and Solemnity of the <hi>Subject</hi> calls for.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the great <hi>points</hi> which the Souls of <hi>Miniſters</hi> ſhould be intently fixed on, if they would <hi>take heed to the Miniſtry which they have received of the LORD that they fulfil it:</hi> And theſe things muſt perpetually im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the Minds of <hi>ſerious Chriſtians</hi> in the working out their own Salvation, as well as be continually Inculcated upon <hi>careleſs Sinners</hi> for their Awak'ning and Converſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="unknown:001939_0004_0FBA2672CCB24268"/>But the great thing now to be deſir'd and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd is, that the <hi>Reader</hi> may bring a Mind ſeriouſly diſpos'd to <hi>receive the Truth.</hi> And O that Men would ſuffer themſelves to be wro't upon to conſider thoroughly theſe <hi>Three</hi> things: The <hi>Greatneſs</hi> of that Salvation which is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by the LORD JESUS CHRIST for them and freely offered to them: the <hi>Shameful Neglect</hi> of it by Chriſtians; and the inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table <hi>Miſeries</hi> which Men unavoidably bring upon themſelves by this Neglect.</p>

               </gap>ſent, no <hi>tongue of Men or Angels</hi> can ſay, how GREAT this SALVATION is. It is incompre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſibly Great in its Bleſſed and Glorious <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, the Great GOD and our SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST.</hi> It is tranſcendently Great in the <hi>Price</hi> that purchas'd it, the <hi>Blood of the SON of GOD.</hi> Ineſtimably Great is the <hi>Subject</hi> of this Salvation, the many Millions of <hi>Immortal Souls</hi> redeemed from the Earth.

            <p>What need is there often to put the <hi>awful Queſtion</hi> to our ſelves, <hi>How ſhall we eſcape—?</hi> Is our Salvation too ſmall an Intereſt for our Concern? Are the matters of our Eternal Welfare mean and trivial? Have we any greater and more worthy care to take us up?</p>
            <p>O therefore that Sinners would but give way to thoſe <hi>juſt Fears</hi> which the Word of the Living GOD would excite in them! Would they but ſit down and ſolemnly ask themſelves, How think I to eſcape the Vengeance of GOD? What will become of me at long run? Is not GOD's Word true? Is the Wrath therein revealed againſt Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinners ſufferable? Can I be content to
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:001939_0006_0FBA26775665F688"/>
be the Object of it? What can be more terrible than the <hi>Words of his Curſe?</hi> Why ſhou'd I <hi>bleſs my ſelf</hi> and ſay, <hi>I ſhall have Peace? Can my heart endure, or my hands be ſtrong, in the day when he ſhall deal with me?</hi> How can I read or hear the Threatnings of GOD's Law and not <hi>exceedingly fear and quake?</hi> Why ſhould they not be to me in GOD's <hi>Word,</hi> and in the Mouth of his <hi>Miniſters,</hi> as if I heard them from the <hi>burning Mountain,</hi> utter'd in <hi>Thunders</hi>? from the dark <hi>Cloud</hi> burſting with flaſhes of Fire? Can I be willing to be <hi>Damned?</hi> Am I come to <hi>that</hi> point, and eaſie in the Apprehenſion? Am I a Stock or a Stone? Is my Soul Iron or Marble? Will nothing make Impreſſion on it? <hi>Do I not fear GOD being under Condemnation, and indeed juſtly?</hi> Have I conſidered what Damnation is? Is there any thing ſo fearful? Are any of our Fears <hi>equal</hi> to it? Why then do I not fear and <hi>fly</hi> from the Wrath of the Almighty? Why do I run upon his <hi>Boſſes,</hi> and on the point of his Sword? Why do I dare his Vengeance? Why am I ſo ſecure and quiet while I lie open to it? Why do I not hearken <hi>now</hi> to my own <hi>Conſcience</hi> and take its Alarms, before it change from a faithful <hi>Monitor</hi> into my Eternal furious Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, Avenger and <hi>Tormentor?</hi> Are its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſes and reproaches too uneaſie now already to bear? But O the laſhes and ſtings of it will be infinitely more torturing and peircing in the place

of Devils and of Deſpair; when the offer of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is never, never to be made again, and the Miſery of Exciſion from GOD comes into actual bearing!</p>
            <p>Thus methinks Sinners under the Goſpel ſhould be making their <hi>Reflections,</hi> cheriſhing thoſe wiſe and proper <hi>Fears</hi> which are neceſſary to their effectual Excitation unto an inſtant and moſt earneſt care for their own Salvation.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> it ſelf will ſupply the <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> with a more labour'd and regular <hi>Train</hi> of tho'ts to this end. That which remains now for me to add is ſome <hi>Apology</hi> for my <hi>Self,</hi> that I have ſuffer'd my ſelf to be prevail'd on by a dear <hi>Friend,</hi> my Reverend <hi>Brother,</hi> to put my Name before his Honour'd <hi>Parents</hi> Book, who is alſo to me a <hi>Father</hi> in Grace and Learning, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt in Years. This Service to the Publick was intended by the late Reverend Mr. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> of whoſe juſt Eſteem and high Veneration for the <hi>Reverend Author,</hi> I have been long a Witneſs.</p>
            <p>The Intelligent <hi>Reader</hi> will eaſily perceive how great a <hi>Maſter</hi> the <hi>Author</hi> is in practical Preaching, and how well ſtudied and experienc'd he is in the Great Doctrines of our Holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; and with what <hi>Art</hi> and <hi>Labour</hi> he adapts his Studies to the Glory of God, and the Good of Souls. GOD <hi>the Father of Light, from Whom every good and perfect Gift comes

down,</hi> hath truly given him the <hi>Tongue of the Learned,</hi> to divide to every one his Portion, to pleaſe and profit, convince, perſwade and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect. It is in the <hi>calm and ſtill Voice</hi> that the SPIRIT of GOD here comes near to the Soul; but O with what <hi>Light and Power,</hi> had the Words and the Will of Man any power to enlighten the mind, and conſtrain the heart.

yea of all Men is ſuch, that they have great and abſolute need of Salvation, and a real ſenſe and conviction hereof will be greatly ſerviceable to awaken and excite Men to a due concernment and ſollicitude, that they may be intereſted in the Salvation offered to them.

               <p n="1">1. IF we look into Man's <hi>preſent natural Eſtate</hi> it will appear to be ſuch as ſhews his abſolute need of Salvation. For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>EVERY man is naturally deſtitute of the Image of God,</hi> even of that knowledge of God, Righteouſneſs and true Holineſs, which was eſpecially the Image of God up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, according to which he was at firſt created. This was Man's peculiar dignity at firſt, which nothing elſe in this lower World was capable of; this was a greater honour to Man, than his Empire and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the World, becauſe this ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d him capable to glorify God and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him, which is the higheſt honour that can be put upon a Creature; but this Man loſt, and all Men have loſt it together with him. Rom. 3.23. <hi>All have ſinned and come ſhort of the glory of God.</hi> Hence no Man naturally hath a Heart to know, to chooſe and love God as his chief good; to ſerve and glorify him as his laſt end; to ſeek after conformity to him, and communion with him as his true bleſſedneſs: but hath a diſpoſition quite contrary hereunto. Now ſuch a loſs as this is an inconceivable miſery:
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001939_0018_0FBA26930AC9DF10"/>
for by reaſon hereof the primitive rectitude, harmony and beauty of the Soul is loſt. Man is not like what he was when he came out of the hands of God. Surely Man needs to have ſuch a loſs repaired, and thereby his primitive health and beauty reſtored.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>THE Nature of Man is univerſally cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</hi> Original purity and rectitude being loſt, there naturally follows an univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filement and deformity upon the whole Soul, and it is wholly diſordered and out of courſe in all thoſe ways wherein it exerts itſelf. <hi>Gods Image</hi> being loſt, <hi>Satans Image</hi> is intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. Inſtead of a holy there is a ſinful nature, inſtead of purity, pollution. God himſelf gives that teſtimony concerning Man, Gen. 6.5. <hi>That the imagination of the thoughts of his heart, were only evil continually.</hi> Sinful motions do as naturally riſe out of the heart as ſparks from the Fire, or filthy ſteams from a Dunghill. And we find many holy Men in Scripture acknowledging and lamenting this natural pollution, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing its cloſe adherence to them, from their firſt being and acting. So <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> So the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 7.18 <hi>I know that in me (that is in my fleſh) dwelleth no good thing,</hi> i e.

And as this pollution extends to all Men ſo its contagion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpreads the <hi>whole man.</hi> Man is wholly corrupt; both Soul and Body are tainted with Sin, to allude to that, Iſai. 1.6. <hi>From the crown of the head, to the ſole of the foot, there is no part clean.</hi> Hence the Soul is naturally running to evil, and readily imbracing the ſollicitations <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </p>
               <p>THIS may be a little <hi>Illuſtrated</hi> in the <hi>ſeveral Faculties</hi> of the Soul.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THE Underſtanding,</hi> the leading Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Soul is wholly corrupted.

50.21. When God offers himſelf as a fit portion and happineſs for the Soul, it can ſee no amiableneſs in him, but prefers <hi>broken Ciſterns</hi> before the <hi>Fountain of living waters.</hi> Hence it is ſo hardly and not without the powerful irradiation of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> convinced of its miſery and wretchedneſs in its diſtance and eſtrangement from God. Sets light by the Offers of his Mercy and Favour that he makes. Can't ſee the evil of Sin, nor the good of Obedience. But <hi>calls evil good and good evil</hi>: and if at any time any thing that is vertuous be eſteemed, its rather from ſome reſpect it bears to himſelf, then from its reſpect to the nature and will of God. How ſuſceptive and tenacious of Error? How many carnal reaſonings againſt the moſt Spiritural truths? What ſwarms of fooliſh impertinent, yea wicked &amp; helliſh thoughts are ſtarting up in the imagination and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and too often brooded and cheriſhed there? What a treaſure of folly and vanity is the mind of Man? Who that ſees it and conſiders it will not with the Apoſtle ſee cauſe, to cry out, <hi>Oh wretched Man that I am,</hi> Rom. 7.24.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THE <hi>Will is corrupt,</hi> and diſcovers it ſelf ſo to be in the various ways of its actings. Perverſe in the choices it makes, preferring evil before good, or a ſeeming

So they expreſs themſelves, Jer. 1.25. <hi>We have loved ſtrangers and after them we will go.</hi> And this is the ground of Chriſt's complaint againſt the <hi>Jews</hi> in his time, Joh. 5.49. <hi>Ye will not come to me, that ye may have life.</hi> And thus God complains of his People: Their <hi>neck is as an iron ſinew,</hi> Iſai. 38.4. That would not hearken to him, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3.7.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE <hi>Memory</hi> which ſhould be the Treaſury and Store-houſe of the Soul of proper and ſeaſonable Truths, for its di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection and comfort, how unfaithful in its office? how ready to receive and entertain and produce what is evil, and to exclude and let ſlip what is good? How often doth God condemn and upbraid his people for their forgetfulneſs and incogitancy: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.21. They forgot God their Saviour. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.7. They remember'd not the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001939_0022_0FBA26996C66B6E8"/>
multitude of thy mercies, yea they ſoon forgot his works. And how much of the ſame diſpoſition may we find; a forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mercies and benefits, forgetfulneſs of vows and promiſes, forgetfulneſs of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand's that are often urged, and repeated. Our memories are too like Sieves that let out the flower and retain the bran. Thro' the corruption of this faculty the ſame Sin becomes often repeated by us.</p>
               <p n="4">4. THE <hi>Affections</hi> of the Soul are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved and out of courſe. Hence thoſe things that ſhould be loved, deſired and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in, are diſliked, rejected and hated; and thoſe things which ſhould be hated are loved. God himſelf who is an infinite, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutable and everlaſting Good, and ſhould be loved with all the heart, ſoul and ſtrength, is diſregarded and ſlighted, and the periſhing objects that the World offers, preferred above him. Hence you read, 2 Tim. 3.4. <hi>That they are lovers of pleaſure more than lovers of God.</hi> Jer. 2.13. <hi>They have forſaken the fountain of living waters, and hew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to themſelves ciſterns, broken ciſterns that can hold no water.</hi> The Creature is preferred above the Creator, and Men are naturally ſeeking a falſe happineſs in the profits, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours and pleaſures of the preſent life, and neglecting a true and ſolid felicity in God.

The like may be ſaid of the paſſions of the Soul, grief, anger, fear, ſorrow, theſe are readily carried to wrong objects.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THE <hi>Conſcience</hi> is alſo wofully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted. Conſcience is that power in Man whereby he was made capable to conſider, review and paſs a judgment upon his own actions. It is Gods monitor in the Soul, to accuſe when we act contrary to the rule he hath given us, and to approve when we do what is right. But the mind being defiled <hi>Conſcience is defiled</hi> alſo. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times thro' ignorance it is ſleepy and ſenſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, don't obſerve and condemn for ſin as it ought, and ſometimes approves what it ſhould condemn. Sometimes thro' the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailency of corrupt affections, it looſeth its authority, don't diſcharge its office, yea ſometimes ſaid to be <hi>ſeared as with a hot iron.</hi> There's no remorſe for ſin: no dread of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Judgment: no care to have the guilt of Sin removed, the heart purified, and Juſtice attoned, as a preparation for it. Now the Soul in all its faculties being thus corrupted and vitiated, doth indiſpenſably need Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Hence follows,</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001939_0024_0FBA26A5197CEED0"/>(3.) <hi>A diſpoſition and proneneſs to all kinds of actual Sin.</hi> Such a darkened underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuch a ſtubborn will, ſuch a depraved ſtate of Soul, muſt needs render it inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all kind of evil, and tho' thro' the temperament of the Body, Education, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment or Company that perſons are link'd with. Corrupt nature diſcovers and exerts it ſelf in ſome more in one way, in others more in another: as the ſtream will run where the channel is cut. Yet there are no particular acts of ſin that any have fallen into, but there is in the corrupt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all, a diſpoſition to act the ſame, that ſpirit of pride and ſelf-love, that natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally governs in every man would carry him hereunto, were an occaſion and temptation offered. But tho' many are with-held from many particular ways of Sin that others commit: yet there are none in their natural ſtate but are under the reigning power of Sin, and miſerable tyranny of Satan; ſo that they run into numerous tranſgreſſions, in thought word and deed every day. The ſenſe whereof caus'd that complaint in the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> Pſal. 19.12. <hi>Who can underſtand his errors?</hi> and of that lamentation, Pſal. 40.12. <hi>Innumerable evils compaſs me about, mine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities are gone over my head.</hi> If our actual ſins are look'd into, they are like the hairs of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001939_0025_0FBA26A75C59FAF8"/>
our heads, or like the ſands on the ſea-ſhore, numerous and beyond account. He that makes the exacteſt inquiry into his life and actions that is poſſible, can't give account of <hi>one of a thouſand,</hi> Job 9.3. Where he takes notice of one, a thouſand will eſcape his obſervation. What duty, what act of our lives can we find that is free from ſin? Yea ſhould you ſingle out the beſt duty that ever you performed, there might be found many ſins intermingled with it. Now, <hi>the wages due to ſin is death,</hi> Rom. 6.23. Every act of ſin makes the ſinner obnoxious to it, and binds the curſe upon him. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous law of God condemns for every tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of it: every ſinful word, thought or action draws down vengeance on your head. So that every ſinner ſtands liable to bear the curſe of the Law whenever the juſtice of God will demand it of him. Were but Mens eyes opened to ſee their ſins, the truth of the threatning, the inflexible ſeverity of Juſtice, they would readily own that they are under an abſolute neceſſity of Salvation.</p>

the greateſt evils entail'd upon it. Theſe might be enlarg'd upon, but I ſhall only hint at ſome under theſe Three Heads.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) ALL <hi>Temporal evils</hi> are the bitter fruits of Sin. <hi>Death</hi> with all its train of diſeaſes, pains, wants, reproaches, jars and diviſions among Mankind, which prove means of embittering life and haſtning of death are the off-ſpring of Sin. <hi>Moſes</hi> in <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.16, <hi>to the end,</hi> gives us a large account of the curſes that Sin would bring upon the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> A ſinner is in danger to be cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his <hi>Body,</hi> in his <hi>Poſterity,</hi> in his <hi>Name,</hi> in his <hi>Eſtate,</hi> in all his <hi>Deſigns and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings.</hi> Should any attempt to give a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary of the numerous evils that have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen Mankind ſince the entrance of Sin, and which have been the <hi>penal</hi> effects of it, they would ſoon be at a <hi>non-plus.</hi> Theſe have been ſo various that it is impoſſible any impenitent ſinner ſhould know when he is ſecure, or be able to foreſee what evils may befall him, while he is here in this World. While a ſinner lies obnoxious to the curſe of the Law in an impenitent and unreconcil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d eſtate, he is in daily danger of one tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral miſery or other, which may either put a period to his life or embitter it to him; yea to that degree as to give him a kind of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001939_0027_0FBA26AA4DAEA7B0"/>
pre-poſſeſſion of Hell upon Earth. Now were there no more then the preſent miſeries that mankind are either groaning under or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious to, they might juſtly awaken deſires in them of the removal or moderation or ſanctification of them; which is a part of the Salvation to be expected by Chriſt. But what is worſe than this,</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) SIN expoſes Men to be <hi>Judicially left of God to Spiritual evils,</hi> and that of all ſorts, of which Scripture and Experience affords abundance of ſad <hi>Inſtances:</hi> Of <hi>ſome</hi> that have been left to ſottiſhneſs and blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, to ſecurity, ſleepineſs, ſeared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and benumedneſs of conſcience, ſo that their fooliſh hearts are darkened with falſe conceptions about the plaineſt and moſt important truths, and their conſciences ſmite not as they ought for the vileſt ſins. Of <hi>others</hi> that have been left to embrace er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. <hi>Others</hi> have been given up to vile affections, and whoſe hearts have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curably <hi>hardened thro' the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> And hence with a deſperate boldneſs ruſh on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> till deſpairing fears overwhelm their ſpirits, and a fearful expectation of Gods fiery indignation poſſeſſes their Souls, and they become like <hi>Paſhur,</hi> who was threatned to be made <hi>a terror to himſelf and to his friends.</hi> No Sinner can tell how far a righteous God

in way of puniſhment for Sin may ſuffer any of theſe ſpiritual plagues to befall him, in this life: therefore to be delivered from the danger of them ought to look'd upon as a moſt deſirable mercy. And yet beyond theſe,</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) EVERY Sinner is in danger of <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal miſeries in the life to come.</hi> Eternal Death is a part of ſins wages, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23. Now this comprehends in it, <hi>all forts of evils</hi> both <hi>privative</hi> and <hi>poſitive,</hi> that either Body or Soul are capable of: and this in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and eternity of them. Our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt who will be the glorious Judge of the World tells us what ſentance ſhall be paſs'd upon the wicked at the laſt Day <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.41. <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the devil and his angels,</hi> ver 40. <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment.</hi> The ſentance is full of terror, and may juſtly rouze up the moſt ſleepy and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſinners to tremble at it, and engage them with greateſt intention of Soul, to apply themſelves to the <hi>Bleſſed Jeſus</hi> that <hi>ſaves from wrath to come.</hi> What comfort can he hope ever to enjoy, that ſhall never enjoy God? What eaſe can he ever hope to find that will be ſurrounded with everlaſting flames? How vainly doth he bleſs himſelf, whom Chriſt will curſe? I proceed,</p>

TO ſhew <hi>Man's impotency</hi> to relieve himſelf under his preſent miſery, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent what is future. Right thoughts where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of will evidence Salvation by another, to be of abſolute neceſſity. Man hath deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf, but it is beyond his power to ſave himſelf. Many have attempted it, and it is no eaſy thing to convince Men of their inſufficiency to do it. But it is a moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth that Men can't do this, For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) HE <hi>hath not power to recover his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive holineſs.</hi> Without holineſs Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be happy; for the want of this renders him unmeet to enjoy God, wherein his hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs conſiſts. That he can't recover this is evident; <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe the Image of God was put upon man at firſt by a creating power, and where-ever this is renewed it requires a like power. Nothing leſs than Almighty Grace is ſufficient to determine the will of Man unto the choice and love of holineſs. Pſal. 10.3. <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> and Eph. 2.10. <hi>Ye are his workmanſhip created in Chriſt Jeſus to good works. Partly,</hi> becauſe the deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Soul thro' ſin is univerſal; all the faculties of it are corrupted; they are all indiſpoſed, none remain ſound by which the reſt ſhould be repaired: the greateſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001939_0030_0FBA26AF13C28C48"/>
the ſtrongeſt perſwaſions, the greateſt encouragements, that are ſet before Men, will not incline them to it, till victorious Grace effectually doth it. Phil. 2.13. <hi>It is God that worketh in you both to will and to do of his own good pleaſure,</hi> and 2 Cor. 3.5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient of our ſelves to think, any thing as we ought, but our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> And <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe there is a natural, rooted enmity in the heart unto holineſs. So that Man left to himſelf would never chooſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs for his happineſs. Rom. 8.7. <hi>The carnal mind is enmity againſt God, and is not ſubject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.</hi> There is a fleſhlineſs in the mind as well as in the affections which diverts the Soul from God, and inclines him to love himſelf above God; and the more holy and ſpiritual any command is the greater reſiſtance and reni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence there is in the corrupt heart againſt it. The great controverſy that Men have againſt Chriſt is his Government, <hi>They will not have him to rule over them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">(2.) HE can <hi>never recover the favour of God,</hi> nor by any act of his own regain the former peace and friendſhip that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween God and him, or do any thing that may entitle him to life. He can't fulfil the duty required in the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> which
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:001939_0031_0FBA26B047148FA0"/>
was <hi>perfect obedience to the law of God.</hi> Now every meer Man fails of this; he hath not only broken the law of God in his <hi>ſurety,</hi> but in his <hi>own perſon.</hi> Eccl. 7.20. <hi>There is not a juſt man upon earth that doth good and ſinneth not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>In many things we all offend.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> once had a great opinion of his own righteouſneſs: <hi>he was alive</hi> as he thought, <hi>Rom,</hi> 7.9. counted his obſervance of the law entitled him to life; but he afterward knew himſelf better, and tells us, <hi>When the commandment came ſin revived and he died.</hi> When he underſtood the ſpiritual meaning and latitude of the law, all his confidence fail'd him, and he deſpair'd of life that way, and was willing not only to account his priviledges but his conſcientiouſneſs too to be, <hi>loſs and dung that he might win Chriſt, and be found in him,</hi> Phil. 3.6,—9. It is not partial but perfect obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that the law promiſes life unto. If a Man has obſerved it in a thouſand inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and after fails but in one, the law con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns him preſently, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>NEITHER can he bear the penalty threatned,</hi> ſo as to ſatisfy the law, and procure his own releaſe from the condemnatory ſentence of of it that way; it is <hi>Death,</hi> even eternal Death that is the <hi>wages of ſin.</hi> Whether God might not have pitch'd upon a leſſer
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001939_0032_0FBA26B349C8A768"/>
puniſhment for ſin, and eſtabliſhed it in his law is not for Man to determine. Reaſon tells us, that the puniſhment God hath threatned is ſuitable both in regard of the Majeſty of God againſt whom ſin is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and becauſe it is little enough to deter Men from ſin; but God having eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed this, will proceed accordingly: now it is impoſſible that a ſinner ſhould procure his own diſcharge by bearing ſuch a puniſhment. And indeed if Men could have ſatisfied for their own ſins, Chriſt's Sufferings might have been ſpared.</p>

               <p n="1">1. TO <hi>Reprove</hi> the <hi>ſecurity and careleſsneſs of ſuch perſons who live as if they had no need of Salvation</hi>: Though ſtill in their ſins, under the guilt and power of them, and obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to all the miſery that they expoſe them unto. It might be juſtly expected that they who have the guilt of all the ſins of their whole lives lying upon them, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day liable to the ſtrokes of Divine wrath and vengeance, which they are neither able to bear nor eſcape, ſhould give themſelves no reſt till they are delivered from this guilt and danger; that nothing in the World ſhould be able to afford any eaſe or peace to

them in this condition. But alas! how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are to be found with whom it is quite o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, who are full of carnal mirth and jollity, altogether unconcern'd and inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble about any Soul wants or dangers: the guilt of ſin is no burden to them, the wrath of God is no terror to them. And though they have the offers of Salvation daily ſounding in their Ears, and repeated calls and encouragements to put in for a ſhare in the bleſſedneſs offered, yet are unaffected and unconcerned about them. To promote the awakening of ſuch ſottiſh and ſleepy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, let me propoſe two or three things.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) IF you are not convinced of your need of Salvation as in ſeaſon duty to ſeek after it, <hi>Damnation will certainly be your por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For there is no middle ſtate between theſe: it is not only a matter very probable that you will fall under the wrath and curſe of God, and be cut off from hopes of mercy and comfort hereafter if you neglect this, but it is certain: the ruin of impenitent and unbelieving ſinners is poſitively declared, Mar. 16.16. <hi>He that believeth not ſhall be damned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and Rom. 2.4, 9. While thoſe who receive and obey Chriſt, and accept Salvation by him, ſhall be admitted into Manſions of Joy and Glory, of Light and

Immortality: you muſt be caſt out into outer darkneſs where will be ſorrow and ſhame, pain and grief, vexation and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh. Were there any hopes of being hid from the revenging hand of God, or after a while that you ſhould be annihilated and ceaſe from the number of beings; or that your <hi>Spirits</hi> at Death like the <hi>Beaſts ſhould go downward,</hi> never any more to be regarded: this would be ſome plea to excuſe your care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs and ſecurity in this matter: but when it is certain that damnation and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery is like to be your portion and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, continuing in this eſtate, your care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſsneſs is inexcuſable. Is <hi>Hell</hi> ſo eaſy a place, is the wrath of God ſo ſlight a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that you need not trouble your ſelf with any concern to eſcape it? Can you tell what it is to bear the revenges of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed Mercy and incenſed Juſtice? Can you bear the weight of an Omnipotent One? The anguiſh of the never dying Worm? The burning heat of thoſe Flames that never ſhall be extinguiſhed? Surely <hi>deſtruction from God ſhould be a terror to you!</hi> And the dread of damnation ſhould make you concerned to obtain Salvation, and diligently to improve your opportunities in order to it!</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) THERE is <hi>nothing in the world will make up the want of Salvation, or be a ground

Surely our <hi>Saviour</hi> ought to be believed, when he tells us that Man will not be profited <hi>who gains the whole world and loſes his own ſoul,</hi> Mat. 16.26. He makes a ſad Bargain of it. Admit but a little ſerious debate with your own hearts and conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces now, and ſay, if ſuch things can quiet
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:001939_0036_0FBA26C11EAF3980"/>

What tho' they have got their ſins pardoned, which you have not, yet you have had theſe and thoſe ſenſual delights and carnal pleaſures, which they han't. While they have gotten a title to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, an <hi>Heavenly Inheritance,</hi> you have got you a good Houſe well furniſhed, and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful accommodations for the World, which they want. While they are beloved of God, you are applauded, reſpected and honoured among Men. Will ſuch thoughts refreſh and ſatisfy you now, or rather will not conſcience make ſad reflections upon you? And how much more will it do ſo at the approaches of Death, and when you muſt appear before the Judgment Seat of Chriſt? when all ſuch things ſhall appear to be trifles and vanities, no more able to relieve you than <hi>Dives</hi>'s former ſplendor did him when <hi>horribly tormented in the flames</hi> of Divine wrath.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.)

without it: But it ariſes from the ſleepineſs of their conſciences, and the blindneſs of their minds, and the hardneſs of their hearts. From the power that ſin hath in them, or the influence that Satan hath over them: ſome are hardened thro' the deceitfulneſs of ſin; that hearken to the flattering promiſes that it makes of profit and pleaſure, that it will yield them; and their love to it blinds them that they can't ſee the evil of it, nor believe the danger attending of it, <hi>but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume they ſhall have peace tho' they walk after the imagination of their evil hearts</hi>: Pleaſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that God either minds not their ſins, or is not offended at them; or they <hi>put far away the evil day.</hi> Or it is from the power and influence of Satan over them, they are infatuated by him. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſpeaks of ſome, 2 Cor. 4.4. <hi>Whoſe eyes the god of this world hath blinded, leaſt the light of the glorious goſpel of Chriſt ſhould ſhine into them.</hi> And there are abundance of methods he uſes to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to ſtrengthen falſe peace and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded hope in them; which I ſhall not go about to enumerate. Now, the direct tendency of this ſecurity is to divert you from a due application of mind to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the means of Salvation; ſo that this blindneſs and ſecurity is a ſad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludium and fore-runner of Damnation, and eventually proves ſo to many.</p>

It's not only a duty enjoyned by God but a point of wiſdom for Men to know their own ſtate; to paſs a right judgment upon themſelves; to know what the ſtate of their Souls is, with reference to Eternity, it being of dangerous conſequence for Men to <hi>think themſelves ſomething when they are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>

                  <hi>TILL you have a ſenſe of your abſolute and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing need of Salvation, you will not be through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concern'd to obtain it.</hi> 'Tis ſenſe of the want, or apprehenſion of the worth of things that inkindles deſires and excites endeavours in Men to obtain them.

heartily concern'd for his favour and pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, till he underſtands and feels his guilt and miſery. 'Tis the Curſe drives Men to the Promiſe, and the dread of Juſtice to the Throne of Grace; a ſight and ſenſe of ſin, that makes a Saviour with all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits become precious, is neceſſary in the eyes of a ſinner.

Bread but the hungry, nor value Waters but the thirſty; or make haſte to the <hi>City of Refuge,</hi> but thoſe that ſee the <hi>Avenger of Blood</hi> at their heels. Inſenſible ſinners will make but little account of a Saviour; they who think they can attone for their own ſins will not prize the Blood of Chriſt: they who think they can ſubdue their own luſts, and purify their own hearts, will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves to the regenerating, and ſanctifying Spirit to do it for them. The ſlight careleſs perſon doth the work of an Age in a breath; we are all Sinners, but God is merciful; Chriſt dy'd for Sinners; and there's an end of their Law and Goſpel work: This ſlightineſs and ſuperficialneſs is the great occaſion why Men deceive and deſtroy themſelves: It is for this reaſon eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially therefore that this <hi>Propoſition</hi> is ſo much inſiſted upon, that perſons may be awakened from their ſelf-flattering dreams, to ſerious conſideration of their indiſpenſible need of the Salvation that the Goſpel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals. Now to further a right ſenſe hereof, let me offer the following Advice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. HAVE a care of judging and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining your ſtate by falſe rules, of comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelves with hopes of the goodneſs of your ſtate upon fallible and uncertain
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001939_0041_0FBA26C9C99F8810"/>
grounds. This is one thing that miſleads many and hardens them in their ſecurity. If the rule be fallible the judgment you paſs upon your ſelves by it can't be certain. Now there are many falſe rules by which Men are comforted. <hi>Some</hi> think their condition good becauſe of their frequency in attending the external duties of Religion. This was the confidence of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> Luk. 18.11. <hi>I faſt twice in the week, I give tithes of all that I poſſeſs.</hi> It is repreſented as a plea that ſhall be rejected by Chriſt, which yet ſome will make: Luk. 13.26. <hi>We have eaten and drank in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets.</hi> External duties of Religion may be fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently attended and that with much ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing devotion and ſeriouſneſs, from cuſtom, example and education, terrors of conſcience, where there is no principle of Grace in the heart. <hi>Others</hi> are comforted upon account of their <hi>moral ſtrictneſs,</hi> and the conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of their carriages; they live ſoberly and righteouſly among Men, and dare not indulge themſelves in ſuch looſe, vain and diſorderly practices as ſome do: This was the confidence of the <hi>Young Man</hi> that came to Chriſt, Mar. 10.20. <hi>All theſe have I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from my youth.</hi> Morallity is amiable and commendable, but Men may be put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this either out of reſpect to their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001939_0042_0FBA26CDF3958160"/>
or to promote their reputation and eſteem among Men, or may be ſcar'd into it thro' terrors of Conſcience and fears of Hell. Conſcientious Men are not all holy. Again, <hi>Some</hi> comfort themſelves becauſe of the <hi>good affections</hi> that they feel many times ſtirring; they have relentings for ſin, and can mourn for their ſinful carriages; their hearts are ſometimes enlarged in the duties of Worſhip they attend; they find ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light and joy in hearing of the Word, they are affected with the Sufferings of Chriſt, with the Glory of Heaven, have deſires after Grace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but there are religious which are not gracious affections. There is a <hi>Legal</hi> as well as an <hi>Evangelical ſorrow</hi> for ſin. <hi>Judas</hi> was much affected with his ſin, and as you read, repented. <hi>Ahab humbled himſelf.</hi> The Stony ground hearers <hi>received the word with joy,</hi> were much affected with it. Of <hi>Johns Baptiſts</hi> hearers you read, Joh. 3.35. <hi>That they were willing for a ſeaſon to rejoyce in his light</hi>; were much awakened by and affected with his Miniſtry. The <hi>Fooliſh Virgins</hi> as you read, Mat. 25. <hi>Deſired oyl,</hi> and that with ſome earneſtneſs and concern<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Balaam</hi> was affected with the bleſſedneſs of the righ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>teous and deſired it, <hi>Numh.</hi> 23.10. So that ſuch working of affection can be no ſolid ground on which you may conclude your
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:001939_0043_0FBA26CF231A7EF8"/>
eſtate to be good; and to add no more, <hi>Some</hi> are attempting to comfort themſelves becauſe of ſome <hi>reſemblances of Grace</hi> that they have; They deſire to be juſtified by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, they have a Love to ſome of the People of God; they have a Heart open to relieve thoſe that are poor and neceſſitous; they have a zeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Sin; they are willing to own and defend the Cauſe of God, and to improve their Eſtates for the ſupport of his Worſhip and Ordinances. But many ſuch things as theſe may be found where there is no true Grace. A Man may deſire to be juſtified by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, and yet not cloſe with him upon the terms of the Goſpel. Men deſire abundance of things that they never attain. There may be Love to Good Men upon ſelfiſh motives, becauſe they are related to them, or becauſe they have been benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent towards them; not becauſe they Love God or his Image appearing in them: and as for zeal againſt Sin, it is many times par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial or ſelfiſh. <hi>Jehu</hi> was zealous againſt the <hi>Idolatry</hi> of <hi>Baal</hi>; but his zeal was wild fire, not the fruit of holy Anger againſt Sin, and Love to the purity of God's Worſhip. And Men may be ſerviceable with their Eſtates to the Worſhip of God, where there is no true Grace. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.28. You read of things
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:001939_0044_0FBA26D162ED6030"/>
dedicated to the Treaſury of the Houſe of God, by <hi>Saul,</hi> by <hi>Abner,</hi> by <hi>Joab</hi> as well as others. Many carnal conſiderations may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Men to ſuch things.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BE willing to <hi>take pains to come to the knowledge of your condition,</hi> that you may ſee your ſtate as it is. There are ſeveral <hi>Helps</hi> which ſhould be uſed in order to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. SEARCH into and lay weight upon the <hi>Teſtimony God gives in his Word concerning it.</hi> The Word of God is a Glaſs that truly repreſents Mans natural deformity and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery. It is the great diſcoverer of the hearts of Men; it lays open the evil nature of ſin, and ſhows the ſad iſſues of it: it is greatly profitable for conviction as well as for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. It would be greatly to Sinners advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage diligently to ſearch into it, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon it. <hi>By the Law is the knowledge of ſin,</hi> Rom. 3.20. By the Word of God you are acquainted that there is an univerſal cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and defilement cleaving to your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. <hi>Gen.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.5. <hi>Behold I was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me.</hi> And Joh. 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh is fleſh.</hi> Sin like a ſtrong poyſon hath diffuſed itſelf thro' all the Blood and Spirits of <hi>Adam</hi>'s miſerable progeny. It informs us that the nobleſt Faculties of the Soul are corrupted by it. Tit. 1.15. <hi>Their mind and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:001939_0045_0FBA26D3A03BA1F8"/>
conſcience is defiled</hi>: and if the leading and governing Faculties of the Soul are thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved, no wonder that the affections and paſſions are tumultuous and diſordered. God whoſe prerogative it is to know the <hi>heart</hi> gives us this account of it. <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.9. That it is, <hi>deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked.</hi> So that from ſuch a heart nothing but Sin is propagated into the life and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Hence it comes to paſs, that the <hi>plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the wicked is ſin</hi>; and their very <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an abomination to God.</hi> And again, ſee the account the <hi>Scripture</hi> gives you of your <hi>danger,</hi> it tells you, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3. That you are <hi>Children of wrath by nature.</hi> It declares that the curſe lies upon all that fail of the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience that the Law requires. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. It tells you, that <hi>God is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> Pſal. 7.11. and in abundance of other places of alike nature God teſtifies to this truth. Now certainly you have reaſon to credit God's Teſtimony, who hath a moſt exact knowledge of Men and things, is of unſpotted truth and of ſuch infinite perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he can be under no temptation to impoſe upon or deceive us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>LOOK over your paſt Lives,</hi> and review what <hi>numerous Sins</hi> have been acted in them. God hath endowed you with a power of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon your ſelves and your paſt acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:001939_0046_0FBA26D505F98698"/>
and ſurely Conſcience is not always ſo ſottiſh and aſleep but it may he ſummoned to do its office, even to bring Sin to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, to <hi>ſhew you your tranſgreſſions, wherein you have</hi> either <hi>exceeded</hi> the limits of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or been wanting to the duty he hath required. Why may you not retire your ſelves ſometimes, and compare the Law of God and your Lives together? and ſeriouſly demand, Hath it been the buſineſs of your Lives to get the knowledge of God in his Nature, Subſiſtences, Properties? and to have a heart diſpoſed to love him, truſt in him, and reverence him as becomes his Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Hath it been your care to worſhip him according to his preſcriptions? to <hi>ſanctify his Name in your hearts,</hi> and to ſanctify his <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> and account them <hi>holy of the Lord and honourable?</hi> or hath not the contrary hereunto been obvious in abundance of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances? And view your carriages <hi>towards Men</hi>; Hath there not been numerous defects in the ſeveral <hi>Relations</hi> you have ſtood in, of a <hi>Ruler</hi> or a <hi>Subject,</hi> as a <hi>Husband,</hi> or a <hi>Wife</hi>: as a <hi>Parent</hi> or a <hi>Child</hi>; as a <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant,</hi> have you fill'd up the Duty of theſe Relations, or hath there not been numerous deficiencies and diſorders in them?

their murmuring againſt their <hi>Rulers,</hi> but from the envy and frowardneſs of their hearts? There is not a ſinful word that ever came out of the Mouth, or an evil action done in the Life, but it was firſt conceived in the heart: beſides innumerable motions of luſt there which are ſuppreſſed by the reſtraints of Grace or Providence.

As <hi>God</hi> he could not ſuffer, as <hi>Man</hi> he could not ſatisfy by ſuffering, but as <hi>God-Man</hi> he could do both. And that he might render his Government amiable to us he appears in our nature, and that his power in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Authority might be ſufficient to reſtrain and deſtroy all his and our enemies, he exerciſes it in his <hi>Divine Nature.</hi> Some of theſe things may be hereafter further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon.</p>

Merit of Chriſt may be graciouſly applied to him: though the Salvation revealed in the Goſpel is a <hi>Doctrine of Grace,</hi> yet it is not promiſcuouſly thurſt upon Men whether they will or no: but God diſpenſes it in a way ſuitable to his <hi>own Honour</hi> and the Sinners <hi>Comfort.</hi> God expects not from the ſinner a valuable compenſation for it, or any perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal worthineſs to recommend the ſinner to his acceptance. <hi>Salvation</hi> is for the <hi>miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; Pardon</hi> for the <hi>Guilty.</hi> But yet there are <hi>Duties</hi> to be done by thoſe that expect to be the ſubjects of it, and it hinders not their being our duties, though it is by his Grace efficaciouſly working in us that we are enabled to do them: they may not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitly be called <hi>parts</hi> of the <hi>Salvation</hi> which the Goſpel offers, or the <hi>Inchoation</hi> of it. Now theſe are,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>FAITH in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Which is a Grace variouſly <hi>expreſſed</hi> and <hi>deſcribed</hi> in the Scripture, ſuitably to the <hi>ſtate</hi> of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: it's ſaid to be a <hi>Coming to Chriſt.</hi> Joh. 6.37. <hi>Him that comes to me I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Which implies the loſt ſtate of a Soul wandring up and down for ſuccour and finding none, upon Chriſt's call <hi>comes to him.</hi> It's expreſs'd by <hi>receiving Chirſt.</hi> Joh. 1.12. <hi>As many as received him.</hi> &amp;c. This implies the gracious offer that God makes of him to nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:001939_0061_0FBA2705CD195908"/>
famiſhing Souls as the <hi>Bread of God that gives life to the World.</hi> It's expreſs'd by <hi>fleeing to Chriſt for refuge</hi> to lay hold <hi>of the hope ſet before us,</hi> Heb. 6.18. Becauſe the Soul con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd for ſafety and life by Chriſt is driven by the terrors of the Law, is purſued by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging Juſtice, and unable to deliver it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: it's expreſs'd by <hi>Leaning upon Chriſt.</hi> Cant. 8.5. <hi>Who is this that cometh out of the wilderneſs, leaning on her beloved.</hi> This im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies that ſuch a Soul is ſinking under the burden of guilt and wrath, and betakes it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Chriſt for <hi>ſupport.</hi> Again, it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by <hi>ſitting under Chriſt's ſhadow,</hi> Cant. 2.3. Becauſe ſuch Souls are as it were ſcorched with a ſenſe of God's wrath. The wrath of a provoked God is a terrible thing to a ſenſible ſinner, which none can ſcreen and defend the Soul from. Chriſt Jeſus is the only ſhelter. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> makes uſe of ſuch <hi>Metaphors</hi> from things ſo plain and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar, that the nature of this neceſſary Grace may be the <hi>better underſtood.</hi> That <hi>Faith</hi> which juſtifies a ſinner is not meerly an <hi>aſſent to a Propoſition,</hi> but is an <hi>act of the will,</hi> as well as of the underſtanding, whereby a ſenſible and law-condemned ſinner, convinced of the truth of the Goſpel, and of the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of Chriſt to anſwer the neceſſities of his Soul, accepts the offer of him that God
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:001939_0062_0FBA2707649DFA48"/>
makes, conſents to take him as a compleat Saviour, intirely depends and relies upon him for Righteouſneſs, Grace and Life. This <hi>Faith</hi> is <hi>God's Gift,</hi> Eph. 2.8. and the effect of the <hi>Fathers drawing,</hi> Joh. 6.44.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>REPENTANCE</hi> is another duty which the Goſpel requires, and which Chriſt as a <hi>Saviour</hi> beſtows, <hi>Act.</hi> 5.31. That Faith which is true is ever accompanied with E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical mourning and brokenneſs of heart for ſin, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. This is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily required to our participation in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of the Goſpel. It is a part of Chriſt's Office to <hi>bind up the broken hearted,</hi> Iſai. 61.1. Accordingly <hi>Repentance</hi> is a duty often preſs'd in the Goſpel, and hath promiſes annexed to it. It was the command of Chriſt to his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> when he <hi>ſent them forth,</hi> Luk. 24.47. That Repentance and remiſſion of Sins, ſhould be Preached in his Name, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly they did ſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you, for the remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And, Act. 3.19. <hi>Repent and be converted, that your ſins may be blotted out.</hi> In vain do <hi>impenitent</hi> Sinners promiſe themſelves Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Chriſt: while Men love their ſins, and live in them, or don't relent for them, or unaffected with the diſhonour and wrong done to God by them, they have the hearts
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:001939_0063_0FBA2708C8161568"/>
of <hi>Enemies toward God,</hi> and muſt expect to be dealt with accordingly.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) <hi>A Life of ſincere Obedience</hi> is alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of thoſe that would be the heirs of Salvation. You read, Heb. 5.9. <hi>He became the author of eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> It was one end of Chriſt's Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>that he might purify to himſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works,</hi> Tit. 2.13. And it is the property of a true Faith to <hi>purify the heart,</hi> Act. 15.9. The more it is exerciſed the more the work of Sanctification is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on: it not only ſhews the <hi>reaſonableneſs of Obedience,</hi> for the honour of the Redeemer, but it <hi>directs the Soul to Chriſt</hi> as the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all Grace and ſpiritual Life: it realizes the truth of the Promiſes, encourages and enables the Soul to ſubmit to Chriſt's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to chooſe his Laws, to follow the conduct of his Word and Spirit, to have a reſpect to all his Commands, knowing that none but <hi>the pure in heart ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5.8. I ſhall add,</p>
               <p n="5">5. THE Goſpel is the <hi>great Means</hi> or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument God makes uſe of for the <hi>Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Salvation</hi> that it reveals, to the Souls of Men. Hence the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Rom. 1.6. calls it, the <hi>power of God unto Salvation.</hi> Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as God in and by it is wont to exert the power of his Grace in gaining the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:001939_0064_0FBA270BE772D0E0"/>
hearts of Men to a thankful acceptance of the Salvation therein offered unto them. The Goſpel doth not barely bring a report to us, that Salvation is attainable, but it is a <hi>Doctrine</hi> propounded in <hi>God's Name,</hi> cloathed with his <hi>Authority,</hi> and accompanied with his <hi>Preſence,</hi> ſo far (as to ſome at leaſt) that it becomes effectual to convey the priviledges purchaſed by Chriſt and contained in it. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> commits Believers <hi>unto God and the word of his Grace,</hi> as that which is <hi>able to build them up and give them an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance among them that are ſanctified,</hi> Acts 20.32. And it is called, Jam. 1.24. <hi>The ingrafted word which is able to ſave our Souls.</hi> This may more fully appear by looking upon <hi>ſome ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial benefits</hi> that are aſcribed to it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. IT is the <hi>ſpecial means</hi> made uſe of by the <hi>Spirit</hi> in the <hi>work of Regeneration.</hi> For this reaſon as well as others, it may be that it is called the <hi>Word of Life.</hi> The convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſpiritual Life to a Soul dead in ſins and treſpaſſes is the firſt thing that prepares a Soul for an actual intereſt in the Salvation purchaſed by Chriſt. Till there be a <hi>ſpirit of Life,</hi> there can be no acts of Life in Faith, Repentance, or any other Graces. Now this is wrought <hi>by the Word.</hi> 1 Pet. 1.23. <hi>We are born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible by the word of God.</hi> And, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.18.
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:001939_0065_0FBA270D99613140"/>
                  <hi>Of his own will begat he us by the word of truth.</hi> As God <hi>created</hi> all things at firſt by his <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Word,</hi> he <hi>ſpake and it was done, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded and it flood faſt.</hi> So when any Soul is created again <hi>in righteouſneſs and true holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> it is done by his <hi>Almighty power</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying <hi>his Word</hi>; this power is not inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in the Word itſelf, but it is mighty thro' God whenever he pleaſes to give efficacy to it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) IT is the <hi>ſpecial means</hi> of <hi>begetting of Faith,</hi> that Faith whereby Men are united to Chriſt, and made partakers of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. This is declared, Rom. 10.17. <hi>Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.</hi> In order to believing, it is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that there be a <hi>Revelation</hi> of a ſuitable ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Faith, that there be an offer of this to the ſinner, that this revelation and offer be credibly atteſted to be from God. Now God doth all this by the Goſpel: Chriſt is there <hi>revealed</hi> as the <hi>end of the Law for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, to every one that believeth.</hi> There is an <hi>offer made</hi> and plentiful aſſurance given to the truth of its being <hi>from God.</hi> What <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid to the convinced <hi>Jaylor</hi> is the voice of the Goſpel to every Sinner. Acts 16.31. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> It is the <hi>Promiſe</hi> of the Goſpel that is the <hi>Warrant</hi> for <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="57" facs="unknown:001939_0066_0FBA270F8C3CE388"/>(3.) THE Word is the great <hi>means of Sanctification,</hi> of <hi>purging out ſin and perfecting holineſs</hi> in the heart. Chriſt prays for his <hi>Diſciples.</hi> Joh. 17.17. <hi>Sanctify them by thy truth, thy word is truth.</hi> Sanctification is a work that is carried on progreſſively, the <hi>New Creature</hi> gradually arrives to its <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> Now as a means of advancing this we are directed, 1 Pet. 2.2. <hi>As new born babes to deſire the ſincere milk of the word, that we may grow thereby.</hi> God in the Goſpel preſcribes us rules of holineſs, tells us <hi>how we ſhould walk and pleaſe God</hi>; how we ſhould walk in <hi>every Relation</hi> and <hi>Condition</hi>: it teacheth us <hi>to deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in the World,</hi> Tit. 2.12. And it gives the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per encouragements to holineſs, and the moſt weighty and preſſing dehortations from ſin. Now when theſe are believed they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come greatly ſerviceable to promote holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs both in heart and life.</p>
               <p n="4">(4.) THE Goſpel is the means of <hi>convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Comfort, Joy and Peace,</hi> to the Souls of Believers. They ſtand in need of <hi>Comfort</hi> upon many accounts; <hi>partly,</hi> in regard of the various troubles, trials and ſufferings that they are expoſed to in the World. The World hates them becauſe of their love to Chriſt: <hi>partly,</hi> in reſpect to the temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:001939_0067_0FBA27110E48C8B8"/>

Man being a guilty is thereby become a very jealous ſuſpicious Creature, and needs ſome powerful ſupports againſt theſe accuſations and fears. Now the way of <hi>Comfort</hi> which God hath provided is not by <hi>Viſions</hi> and <hi>Voices from Heaven,</hi> but by the <hi>Word of promiſe</hi> in the <hi>Goſpel</hi>; by <hi>this</hi> he <hi>gives ſtrong Conſolation unto the heirs of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Heb. 6.17, 18. Applying of them according to the various conditions and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of his People. I paſs to ſome <hi>AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLICATION</hi> of this.</p>

                  <hi>USE I.</hi> HOW <hi>exceeding thankful</hi> ought we to be for the <hi>Goſpel</hi> upon this account, that it lays open and reveals a way of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation for guilty Man. A thing ſo great that all the wiſdom of the World could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have diſcovered. A <hi>perpetual night of darkneſs</hi> had for ever overſpread the face of the World, and the whole race of Mankind had been involv'd in guilt and deſpair, and under a <hi>fearful expectation of God's fiery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> if God hath not ſcattered it, by the
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:001939_0068_0FBA271288FF7B68"/>
breaking forth of the Light of the Goſpel. We that are priviledged with it are under ſpecial Obligations to be thankful for it.</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) IN that it is an <hi>Act of ſpecial Grace and Mercy.</hi> God was under no obligation to Man to do this for him. Men have no moral excellencies to commend them to God. Sin had diſtroyed him of his native beauty, made him loathſome before God, <hi>Who is of purer Eyes then to behold iniquities.</hi> There was no ſuch thing <hi>due</hi> to Man in a way of Juſtice. Yea, Juſtice was engaged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, and with its <hi>flaming Sword, kept the way to the tree of Life.</hi> God ſtood in <hi>no need</hi> of Man's Friendſhip and Salvation: he could otherways have provided for his own honour; or had he ſeen meet, contented himſelf to have glorified his Mercy upon the holy Angels, and his Juſtice upon fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Angels and Men. God's manifeſtation of his Glorious Perfections is <hi>purely Arbitrary.</hi> He might have conceal'd them as through a vaſt Eternity he had done. Further God was <hi>in no fear of Man,</hi> to move him to it. Men ſpare Offenders ſometimes thro' fear, but God fears no Man's anger. <hi>All nations are</hi> counted <hi>to him lighter than nothing and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Had God executed upon <hi>Adam,</hi> and all his ſinful progeny, the threatning of the firſt Covenant, there could have been no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:001939_0069_0FBA271507C6C4B8"/>
or unreaſonable ſeverity imputed to him. I know that the carnal minds of Men are prone to cavil at the Juſtice of God in the imputation of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, to them who had no actual being at that time, and never gave their <hi>perſonal conſent</hi> to the <hi>Covenant</hi> tranſaction between <hi>God</hi> and <hi>him</hi>: but the <hi>Equity</hi> of this might be evinc'd, <hi>partly,</hi> from the unſpotted <hi>purity</hi> of God, <hi>who is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works,</hi> Pſal. 147.17. is ſubject to no error or partiallity in any of his Adminiſtrations: <hi>partly,</hi> from the <hi>common reaſon</hi> of Mankind, which allows it to be both juſt and neceſſary in many ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for <hi>Children</hi> to act by their <hi>Parents,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> by their <hi>Repreſentatives,</hi> and count themſelves <hi>bound by their Act. Beſides,</hi> had all Mankind been in being at that time, and called to put in <hi>their Suffrage</hi> for a fit Perſon to repreſent them, no doubt they would with one conſent have pitched upon their <hi>common Father</hi>; eſpecially conſidering how he was qualified for the truſt repoſed in him. The execution therefore of the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning being a thing in it ſelf juſt, the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it muſt be <hi>an act of Grace</hi>; The <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> aſcribes our Salvation here unto, Eph. 2.8. <hi>By Grace are ye ſaved.</hi> Yea ſo illuſtrious is the grace and good-will of God herein, that our moſt enlarged praiſes cannot duly cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate

it; nor our higheſt thoughts ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comprehend it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) IT is ſuch Grace as <hi>is not the common lot of Mankind.</hi> Though the Divine Mercy hath enlarged itſelf in theſe <hi>latter Ages</hi> of the World beyond what it did in <hi>elder Times,</hi> yet there are many <hi>vaſt Nations</hi> of the World who are covered with <hi>droſs darkneſs,</hi> and in the <hi>region of the ſhadow of Death.</hi> The curſe of God lies upon them from Generation to Generation. God who is the ſovereign Lord of his own Grace ſhews his liberty in this matter, and it is free Mercy that is to be acknowledged in the manifeſtations of it to ſome, while he denies it to others. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> attributes it hereunto, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25, 26. What did God ſee in you more than in them? You are not leſs defiled by nature than they, nor leſs obnoxious to Juſtice; <hi>Children of wrath</hi> by nature as well as they; have no greater propenſions to any thing that is good than they.

               <p>CARRYING in it the brighteſt diſplays of the Divine Glory; containing in it the greateſt Mercy. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls it, <hi>Great Salvation:</hi> the manner of his expreſſion is worth our Obſervation, <hi>SO Great Salvation.</hi> Which may denote the inexpreſſible, yea, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivable Greatneſs of it! A Salvation beyond any other that God hath ever vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to Men. Many great Salvations God hath wrought ſince the beginning of the World, but the Salvation of Sinners by <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt</hi> is beyond all compariſon. We have an expreſſion parallel hereunto, Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Son. So</hi> as can't be told. The love ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in this <hi>Gift</hi> is inexpreſſible! We read concerning the <hi>Works</hi> of God in general that they are <hi>Great!</hi> Honourable and Glorious, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.2, 3. The works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> are ſo, they may fill the hearts of conſiderate beholders, with wonder and aſtoniſhment; ſuch as the higheſt flights of humane underſtanding cannot penetrate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to:

and it is eminently true of this <hi>Work</hi> of <hi>Redemption,</hi> or the Salvation of Sinners by Jeſus Chriſt; for which the Praiſes of God will be celebrated throughout the days of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity. There are ſo many great and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterious things concurring to it and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it, ſuch ineſtimable bleſſings ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying of it as may juſtly render it <hi>marvellous</hi> in our eyes.

It was beyond them to determine how the Sinner ſhould be ſaved, and Sin condemned. How <hi>Mercy</hi> might be exerciſed, and the rights of <hi>Juſtice</hi> not impaired. How the honour of Gods <hi>Truth</hi> in the threatning of Death to ſin could be vindicated without the <hi>Death of the Sinner.</hi> How the ruling <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God in eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

a Law by which Mankind ſhould be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned, could be manifeſted unleſs Divine <hi>Juſtice</hi> did proceed according to it: and how this could be done and Man preſerved from everlaſting ruin was above their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion. But the Wiſdom of God hath ſurmounted all theſe difficulties, in bringing about this great work, it is ſo eſtabliſhed that there is no breach in the harmony of the <hi>Divine Attributes.</hi> The <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of God hath pitched upon ſuch a way wherein his <hi>Truth, Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Mercy</hi> might all be <hi>Glorified.</hi> As the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> obſerves, Pſal. 85.10. <hi>Mercy and truth have met together, righteouſneſs and peace have kiſſed each other.</hi> Beſide there is a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious diſplay of the <hi>God-Head</hi> and its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.

of God, which appeared in <hi>Creation,</hi> in the variety of Creatures that were made, and adapting of them to their reſpective ends, appears in this work with a yet grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter luſtre; and over and above, God's <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Truth, Juſtice and Mercy,</hi> ſhine forth in their tranſcendent excellencies: the glory of the Divine Perfections did never ſo diſplay itſelf as it doth in this wonderful work of bringing about Salvation for ſinful Man. Inſomuch that you read that the <hi>Heavenly Spirits</hi> deſire to ſtoop down and <hi>look into this wonderful work,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12. that they might ſolace themſelves with the manifeſtations of divine Glory appearing herein, and have their love and praiſe excited upon the occaſion of it.</p>

never have been employed about a trifle or ſmall matter. The conſervation and manifeſtation of the divine Glory requir'd that ſo great a Perſon ſhould be entruſted with this work. You read in 1 Pet. 1.18. <hi>We are not redeemed with, corruptible things, as ſilver and gold.</hi> No ſuch price was of value ſufficient for the Redemption of a Soul; much leſs of all the Souls of the <hi>Elect</hi>; but it muſt be the <hi>precious Blood of Chriſt,</hi> of <hi>God Incarnate</hi> to procure ſuch an ineſtimable be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, otherways that might be thought of were inſufficient. There was no hopes of Mans re-entry into Paradiſe to make a new trial of his Fidelity to the firſt Covenant; that made no promiſes to Repentance being once broken, and that was guarded againſt him: there was no hope of having life <hi>by the Law</hi> that was <hi>become weak through the fleſh,</hi> Rom. 8.3. Mans ſinfulneſs had rendred him obnoxious <hi>to Death</hi> by it, and uncapable to perform the righteouſneſs it required of him, ſo far as would be accepted for his Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor would any of the <hi>Sacrifices</hi> or <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi> purifications of the Law avail here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. <hi>It was not poſſible that the blood of bulls and goats ſhould take away ſin.</hi> All theſe Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonial rites could not take away the guilt of ſin; nor any further relieve the conſciences of Men, then as they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected

them to look to the <hi>Great Sacrifice</hi> which they were appointed to <hi>Typifie</hi> and repreſent; nor were they ever deſigned by God in their inſtitution and eſtabliſhment to an higher end. Yea it was a work too great for an <hi>Angel</hi> to have performed: for an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wrath would have been a burthen too heavy for any meer creature to have endured. Nor would there have been that worth and value in the ſervices and ſufferings of any creature, or indeed of all creatures, as the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="1">(1.) HE <hi>aſſumes an humane Nature into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal union with his Divinity.</hi> This is a Doctrine that the <hi>Scriptures</hi> do very expreſly and largely inſiſt upon, as might be ſhewn in abundance of Places, and do alſo declare to us why it was neceſſary he ſhould do this; that he might be a fit Perſon to ſuſtain the office of a <hi>Surety</hi> in our ſtead, being one that had a true humane Nature, was fit to perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Man, and to ſatisfy for him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. The reaſon why the <hi>fallen Angels</hi> are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved is, becauſe there is no Surety provided in <hi>their Natures,</hi> to tranſact for them. But Chriſt Jeſus aſſumed the <hi>Nature of Man</hi> that
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:001939_0088_0FBA27470C0F7A88"/>
he might make ſatisfaction in the Nature that had ſinned; and therefore a <hi>body was prepared for him,</hi> as he informs us; becauſe other <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were not ſufficient, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.5,—10. Now this was a great, a glorious and wonderful thing! that the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhould be thus <hi>exalted,</hi> and that he who was the <hi>brightneſs of his Fathers Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon.</hi> Who <hi>thought it not robbery to be equal with God,</hi> ſhould be made in the <hi>likeneſs of Men,</hi> Phil. 2.6, 7.

But <hi>he was made ſin for us who knew no ſin himſelf, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.21. and, Iſai. 43.4, 5.6. Now this being a neceſſary means for the bringing about our Salvation, ſhews it to be inexpreſſibly, yea inconceivably <hi>Great</hi>! There is no higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of love among the deareſt friends that have ever been in the World, then to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their lives for each other, but Chriſt hath commended his love beyond this, that while we were <hi>enemies he died for us,</hi> Rom. 5.8, 10. That ſo glorious a Perſon as <hi>God-Man</hi> ſhould groan and ſigh under the burthen of Divine Wrath, ſhould be expoſed to ſuch painful and ignominious Sufferings! even to Death itſelf! was ſuch a Work as aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed

               <p n="4">4. HAVING performed the work of his <hi>Humiliation,</hi> our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror over Death and Hell, roſe from the Grave, aſcended into Heaven, is crowned with Glory, and lives continually</hi> to make <hi>Interceſſion</hi> for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. His <hi>Reſurrection</hi> was a glorious and eminent proof of his Satisfaction to the Law, in what he had ſuffered: the Law had threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Death to ſin, therefore that the Sinner might live, the Surety muſt die: but that the ſufficiency &amp; acceptableneſs of his Death unto the ends for which he ſuffered might appear he muſt riſe again, and not be <hi>held under the power of Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HIS <hi>Reſurrection</hi> plainly ſheweth that God hath accepted the Death of Chriſt, as a ſufficient <hi>ranſom for our Sins.</hi> The active and paſſive Obedience of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was every way enough to free us from ſin and from condemnation by ſin. But his <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> was a viſible evidence of the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorineſs of his Death. This had the nature of a <hi>ſolemn acquittance</hi> and diſcharge; it is aſcribed to the <hi>Father</hi> as his diſcharge of

He <hi>died for our offences, and roſe again for our juſtification.</hi> This act of his is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing proof that he is indeed the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and Saviour of the World: not an <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor</hi> or deceiver, as the <hi>Jews</hi> wickedly traduc'd him: his own living alſo ſhews him to be capable to <hi>convey life</hi> to others; which if he had remained in a ſtate of Death he could not have done, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.19. And then the acceptableneſs and value of it, is further diſcovered in that he not only roſe but <hi>aſcended to the right hand of God.</hi> This is a pledge and proof of his compleat <hi>Victory</hi> over all his Enemies, and ſhews how fully he was accepted of the Father. Having ſuch glorious dignity and honour put upon him, it carries ſtrong ground of encouragement to his people to commit themſelves and all their concernments into his Hands, Eph. 1.20, 21. 1 Pet. 3.22. <hi>He is gone into Heaven, Angels, Authorities and Powers being made ſubject to him.</hi> A <hi>further</hi> priviledge following hereupon is his <hi>INTERCESSION</hi> for his People, ant that
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:001939_0093_0FBA275740A0DBB0"/>
this muſt needs be prevalent and ſucceſsful is ſufficiently obvious from the <hi>reallity</hi> of his Death, the <hi>ſatisfactorineſs</hi> of it, and the high <hi>honour</hi> that is now put upon him as the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of it.</hi> He is in all reſpects accompliſhed for this work, and a Perſon ſo tenderly loved and ſo highly honoured that he ſhall not be rejected in any of the requeſts that he makes for his People, 1 Joh. 2.1. <hi>If any man ſin we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> Heb. 2.14, 15, 16, 17. And it is upon theſe ſeveral <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Death, Reſurrection, Aſcenſion,</hi> and <hi>Interceſſion</hi> of Chriſt, that the <hi>Holy Apoſtle</hi> lays the Foundation of his own <hi>Triumph</hi> and of all Believers, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33, 34. and ſo on. From the conſideration of the things ſpoken there is ground to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that if the manifeſtation of the glory of God in the Salvation of his Elect had not been a thing of great weight and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, ſuch great things had never been in order to it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE greatneſs of this Salvation might alſo be argued from the neceſſary, gracious and effectual <hi>Operation of the Holy Spirit in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying of it to the Souls of Men.</hi> Not only the coming of Chriſt, but the coming of the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> which are the moſt ſignal favours that God manifeſts to Mankind, give us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude that they are ſome great
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:001939_0094_0FBA2758558DF1C0"/>
and weighty ends for which they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd. Now there was a neceſſity of both theſe to the bringing home Salvation to the Souls of Men. Had not care been taken for the <hi>Application</hi> as well as the <hi>Impetration</hi> of Redemption, the caſe of fallen Man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering his impenitency and obſtinacy, had been ſtill deplorable: But the Lord Jeſus Chriſt having ſatisfied the Juſtice of God, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured favour for ſinful Man, he informs us that the <hi>deſcent of the Spirit</hi> ſhould be one eminent fruit and teſtimony of it. And by minding them of this, comforts his <hi>Diſciples</hi> when greatly dejected with the thoughts of his bodily <hi>abſence from them,</hi> Joh. 16.7. And though the Church in all Ages have been in ſome degree priviledged with the preſence of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> yet the more large and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful communications of it hath been reſerv'd to the <hi>times of the Goſpel</hi>; it being the great and ſpecial promiſe that had been given for thoſe times, as may be ſeen in many <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> Joh. 7.37, 37. Act. 2.38. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> calls the Goſpel by way of eminency, <hi>The miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8. And on this account checks the folly of the <hi>Judaizing Galatians,</hi> that they were grown fond of the <hi>Moſaick Rites,</hi> and had abated in their valuation and eſteem of the Goſpel, by minding them of the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:001939_0095_0FBA2759DBC09570"/>
they had had by it. Gal. 3.2. <hi>This on-would I learn of you, received you the ſpirit by the works of the law or by the hearing of faith;</hi> by which he intends the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. In 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12. The Goſpel is ſaid to be Preached <hi>with the Holy Ghoſt, ſent down from Heaven.</hi> Now the reaſon of this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the holy Spirit was not only to <hi>prepare</hi> the World to give entertainment to it, by the <hi>extraordinary Operations</hi> that did accompany it at its firſt publiſhing, but that alſo by its efficacious and powerful operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the Souls of Men they might be actually intereſted in the Salvation that the Goſpel reveals. In order to this there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral gracious operations of the Spirit, in <hi>Convictions of Sin, Opening the Eyes,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening the Conſciences of Sinners,</hi> to ſhew them their guilty, polluted, periſhing condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without a <hi>Saviour,</hi> and leading them into the knowledge of the ſufficiency and ſuitableneſs of the remedy, which is reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in it; in <hi>Regenerating</hi> the Soul, diſpoſing and inclining of it to a <hi>new Life,</hi> and aſſiſting it thereunto in the work of <hi>Sanctification,</hi> of which the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> is the <hi>principal Author,</hi> who deſtroys the life of ſin by degrees, and cheriſhes and confirms thoſe gracious diſpoſitions that he hath wrought: and as a <hi>Spirit of Conſolation,</hi> refreſhing the

Now that ſo gracious a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſhould be employed in this work by ſuch operations upon the hearts of Men in order to their Salvation, ſhews the work to be Great. But further,</p>
               <p n="4">4. THAT it is great Salvation will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we conſider, <hi>From what evil and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery we are ſaved.</hi> The greater any evil is from which a Perſon is delivered, the more affected he is wont to be with it. To be delivered from ſome tormenting pain, from ſome cruel bondage and ſlavery; from the apprehenſions of preſent Death, are wont to be accounted great things: but they are the moſt <hi>formidable</hi> of all evils, from which <hi>Chriſt delivers</hi> his People.

               <p n="3">(3.) I might add, that it is a Salvation that comprehends in it <hi>the mitigation and ſanctification of all temporal evils,</hi> that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God are in this World expoſed unto. It is one great and gracious fruit of the love
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:001939_0100_0FBA219C86DABED8"/>
of God in Chriſt toward Sinners, and a part of that Salvation which is wrought for them; that tho' in his Fatherly wiſdom he cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them, yet their chaſtiſements are <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal,</hi> not <hi>Penal</hi> and <hi>Vindictive:</hi> deſign'd by <hi>Love,</hi> and over-rul'd to their <hi>Spiritual Profit,</hi> and have many comfortable Promiſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to them. And theſe are all ordered in ſuch <hi>ſeaſons</hi> and in ſuch a <hi>meaſure</hi> as Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> ſee to be beſt: and thro' the Grace of Chriſt they have many ſupports and conſolations under them, and a ſeaſonable releaſe from them. Nor ought this to be accounted a ſmall or diſpicable privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
               <p n="5">5. THAT it is a great Salvation which the Goſpel reveals and offers to Sinners by Chriſt, may further appear, if we conſider, <hi>What Bleſſings it contains in it,</hi> and <hi>what Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges it intitles Believers unto.</hi> Beſides the freedom from the forementioned evils, there are many <hi>poſitive Bleſſings</hi> belonging to it, and theſe ſuch as are invaluably great.

Now the Salvation which is brought us by the Goſpel contains in it the <hi>beſt Good,</hi> and ſuch
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:001939_0101_0FBA219E30B7A630"/>
as we have the greateſt reaſon to deſire and to be concerned for. I ſhall <hi>inſtance</hi> in ſome of the <hi>Priviledges</hi> of it, but not <hi>inlarge</hi> upon them.</p>
               <p>THEY who are brought to cloſe with the offers of it are brought into a ſtate of <hi>Peace and Reconciliation with God.</hi> The dreadful breach that ſin had made between God and the Sinner is made up, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. Peace with Men is deſirable, <hi>Peace of Conſcience</hi> is more deſirable: but <hi>Peace with God</hi> is moſt of all ſo! and indeed this lays the ſureſt foundation for the other.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, <hi>Their Sins are Forgiven,</hi> and they are made <hi>righteous</hi> before God, thro' the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt</hi> unto them by <hi>Faith,</hi> Rom. 8.12. That vaſt debt which they owed, is cancelled: God hath received full ſatisfaction for it, in their Surety, and doth upon believing freely, fully and for ever diſcharge them from it. Now this is a bleſſed Priviledge, and makes thoſe happy that obtain it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.1, 2.</p>
               <p>AND <hi>Further</hi> hereupon their <hi>Perſons</hi> and <hi>Services</hi> are <hi>accepted,</hi> Eph. 1.6. Their hearts are <hi>ſanctified,</hi> and they are graciouſly renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reſtored to ſome conformity to the <hi>Divine Image and Likeneſs,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.4. And have the <hi>Promiſes of Preſervation</hi> in a ſtate of Grace; that the good Work begun in them

ſhall not be ſo obſtructed, either by remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſinfulneſs, or the many artifices of the Tempter; but ſhall in due time be perfected in them. Thoſe weak beginnings of Grace thro' the powerful and abiding preſence of the Spirit of Grace ſhall be preſerved and cheriſhed, till they arrive at the ſtature of perfect Men in Chriſt. Such a <hi>Promiſe</hi> was never given to <hi>Adam</hi> in his ſtate of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency.</p>
               <p>THEY have alſo <hi>Liberty of Acceſs to the Throne of Grace,</hi> and encouragement to expect that they ſhall <hi>obtain mercy and find grace to help in all times of need,</hi> Eph. 2.18. Heb. 4.16. How much comfort and ſollace doth this afford to gracious Souls? That they have ſuch a wiſe, powerful and gracious God to go to in <hi>all</hi> their wants, fears and temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? Hence alſo they have <hi>gracious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with God</hi>: there are ſpecial Seaſons wherein he makes them glad with his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, leads them into the underſtanding of his Excellencies, ſhews them the ſtability of his <hi>Covenant</hi>; ſhines upon their Graces, and <hi>fills</hi> them with unſpeakable Conſolation.</p>
               <p>FURTHER, They have the priviledge of <hi>Adoption,</hi> they are honoured not only with the <hi>Title</hi> of Children, but have the real pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge of ſuch. <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.12. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.18.

<pb n="94" facs="unknown:001939_0103_0FBA21A5E3336DC8"/>
and obedience towards God. They have his Fatherly care of them while here; and they have a <hi>Childs Portion</hi> and Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, reſerved for and promiſed to them. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. And this is ſo <hi>rich</hi> and <hi>great,</hi> ſo full and compleat as will exceed all their deſires and expectations; nothing ſhall be wanting to their ſatisfaction and felicity. On all theſe accounts the Priviledges of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation are great: but were there no more than this <hi>one act</hi> of Divine Grace, their full <hi>enjoyment of God</hi> in a ſtate of Heavenly Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; this might abundantly convince us that it is ſo. To be <hi>ever with the Lord,</hi> to <hi>behold his face in righteouſneſs,</hi> is a thing great, to aſtoniſhment!</p>

                  <hi>USE I.</hi> HOW <hi>greatly concern'd Men ought to be for the Salvation of their own Souls,</hi> and <hi>with what weight this matter ſhould lie upon their Spirits.</hi> It is the <hi>Soul</hi> in a principal manner that is the ſubject of this great Salvation we have been ſpeaking of, (tho' it is readily granted that the Body according to its ſtate and capacity ſhall ſhare in it,) had not Man been enobled with a <hi>Soul</hi> of an Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal nature, there had been no reaſon to have expected that ſuch great things ſhould ever
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:001939_0104_0FBA21A7055DC398"/>
have been done for his Salvation. It was the Soul eſpecially that was ſtained and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted with ſin, that needed to be reſtored by ſanctifying Grace; it was the Soul that was firſtly ſubject to the impreſſions of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Wrath, and that can have the deepeſt ſenſe of it. It is the <hi>Soul</hi> that is capable to know, love, fear, glorify and enjoy God, and it was the tender compaſſions of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt working towards our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious but periſhing <hi>Souls</hi> which (next to the Glory of his Father) mov'd him to do what he hath done for the Salvation of them. Hath then the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Father,</hi> the <hi>Love</hi> of the <hi>Son,</hi> the <hi>Grace</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> been thus employed to bring about Salvation for our loſt and dying Souls? How abundantly may it convince us of the great value of them, and engage to a deep concern for them, and ſolicitude that it may be well with them. There's no deſign that Men have to carry on, no buſineſs that they have to do, of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual weight with this: and which deſerves ſuch regard from them. Surely would Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons conſider <hi>theſe things</hi> as they ought, it would be impoſſible that their Souls ſhould be neglected as they are. As means to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken hereunto, Conſider,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) SURELY <hi>GOD knows the worth of Souls.</hi> He that made them muſt needs know
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:001939_0105_0FBA23C3CF498748"/>
the value of them: He knows their nature, their capacity, what vaſt deſires they are fill'd with, and what an eternal felicity they are capable of: and ſhall we have ſuch mean thoughts of them, as only to think them fit to continue for the Body, to be employed in <hi>ſearching</hi> into the <hi>works of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or Art,</hi> or much leſs be enſlaved to <hi>fleſh and ſenſe,</hi> that we might be a <hi>wiſer</hi> ſort of <hi>Beaſts.</hi> It were a ſhame to us to think ſo, and not turn our Souls to the contemplation of their nature and uſe, and to think with our ſelves, Hath God been thus concern'd for the Salvation of them, what a ſin and ſhame will it be for us to be careleſs of and unconcerned for them.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) Conſider, <hi>HOW great danger you are in of loſing your Souls,</hi> and failing of the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. The <hi>Soul</hi> as precious as it is may be loſt, and too many are in every Generation of Men; and there's danger of every one of your Souls in particular, being loſt, that are not intereſted in the great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that the Goſpel reveals to you. For there is a <hi>Sentence of Death</hi> and Condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en now lies upon you: this ſeizes upon you ſo ſoon as you become one of the <hi>Children of Adam,</hi> Eph. 2.3. We are <hi>Children of Wrath</hi> by nature, and it continues upon you while you abide in unbelief, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.18. None but
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:001939_0106_0FBA23C54FF32528"/>
Chriſt can deliver you from it by preſenting himſelf to Juſtice in your ſtead. There's danger, becauſe of your <hi>ignorance</hi> of Chriſt's Excellency, and your <hi>natural averſion</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs thro' <hi>pride, ſloth, love of ſin,</hi> the ſnares <hi>and allurements of the World,</hi> to come unto him, for the Salvation he hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed: there's danger in regard of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and <hi>unwearied ſubtle attempts</hi> that <hi>Satan</hi> the great Adverſary is uſing to deſtroy your <hi>Souls.</hi> He <hi>goes about as a roaring lion ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.6. And he <hi>hunts</hi> for the precious life; they are the Souls of Men that he would prey upon. He hath already drawn you into abundance of ſins, and is daily tempting you to more, that he might bring upon you a dreadful &amp; irremedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous deſtruction: now ſhould not the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger you are in of loſing them awaken your care of them and thoughtfulneſs for them.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Conſider, <hi>THE loſs of your Souls will be very dreadful.</hi> Perſons have deeply la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented other loſſes that they have met with, but who can conceive what will be the doleful outcries and bitter complaints of them that loſe their Souls? The loſs of the Soul doth not conſiſt in the <hi>annihilation</hi> of it; but in its <hi>ſeparation and baniſhment from God</hi>; and in the impreſſions of <hi>divine wrath</hi> upon it, and its being ſentenc'd to the <hi>eternal regions
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:001939_0107_0FBA23C7041DD540"/>
of darkneſs &amp; deſpair.</hi> How doleful will it be to be excluded out of the Kingdom of Heaven, when others ſhall be admitted into it! to be thruſt down with infernal Spirits and damned Souls! when others ſhall <hi>ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob in the kingdom of God,</hi> Mat. 8.12. How doleful will it be to be ſentenc'd to <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from God</hi>! to be excluded from any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable ſight of God, when others ſhall be encircled in the Arms of his love, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to a ſtate of ſatisfying Fellowſhip and Communion with him? How doleful will it be, to be a monument of Divine Wrath, to feel the weight of revenging Juſtice, when others ſhall taſte and experience the love of God, and drink of the river of his Pleaſures? <hi>Theſe things</hi> are dreadful beyond what our narrow underſtanding can now comprehend! and it will yet further inhance theſe miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, that when theſe <hi>Spiritual evils</hi> ſhall light upon impenitent Sinners, there will be no <hi>Temporal good things,</hi> ſuch as they now enjoy, to alleviate them, nor to divert their thoughts from the afflicting ſenſe of them: The <hi>rich Man</hi> in the <hi>Parable,</hi> Luk. 16.24. is not able to command a <hi>drop of Water to cool his tongue,</hi> when horribly ſcorch'd <hi>in thoſe Flames</hi>: but eſpecially the <hi>Eternity</hi> of theſe miſeries ſhews them to be inexpreſſibly dreadful! if there were any hope that there might ever be an

end of them, tho' it were after <hi>Thouſands or Millions of Years,</hi> this would be ſome mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, but this thought, that the <hi>Worm never dies,</hi> that the <hi>Fire is never quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> fills the Soul with the moſt tormenting rage and deſpair!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE II.</hi> HOW much reaſon we have <hi>to admire the riches of divine Wiſdom, Grace and Love</hi> which hath provided ſo great and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious a Salvation for us. We read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 111.4. He hath made his <hi>wonderful works to be remembred.</hi> God would not be forgotten in the World, therefore he hath ſet before us evident <hi>marks</hi> of his <hi>Perfections</hi> in his works of <hi>Creation</hi> and <hi>Providence,</hi> which are with heedful obſervation and intention of mind to be reflected upon. But the Divine <hi>Perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> do yet more illuſtriouſly ſhine forth in the work of <hi>Redemption</hi>; and in this eſpecially our thoughts ſhould be employed: that our Souls might be filled with ſuitable apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of them. And for this great work God ſhould ever be <hi>Glorious in our Eyes</hi>! The <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt</hi> contemplating the Works of God cries out with admiration and praiſe! Pſal. 8.4. <hi>What is man that thou art mindful of him, and the ſon of man that thou viſiteſt him</hi>! So great is the diſtance between the Great and Holy God, and mean and ſinful Man; that we have reaſon to look upon it wonderful <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcention</hi>
                  <pb n="100" facs="unknown:001939_0109_0FBA23CCC2F7AC90"/>
that he ſhould expreſs his regards in the loweſt inſtances of it. So holy <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> thought, <hi>Gen.</hi> 32.10. But it is much more to be admired, that he ſhould employ his Wiſdom in ſuch a wonderful contrivance as that of our Redemption: give his <hi>Son</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume our nature, to obey and ſuffer and die, that he might redeem and ſave us, ſend forth his Almighty <hi>Spirit,</hi> to make applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Redemption notwithſtanding the rebellion and reluctancy of our hearts againſt it: and it ſhould the more endear it to us, conſidering that as great and wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as it is, it was no more then we had ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute need of, and had been for ever loſt and undone, if infinite Wiſdom, Love and Grace had not been in this way concerned for us. The <hi>Scripture</hi> ſets it forth by ſuch expreſſions as may abundantly raiſe our eſteem and admiration of it. It tells us, Joh. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> And Rom. 5.8. <hi>God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his love toward us in that while we were yet ſinners Chriſt died for us</hi>! It calls it <hi>riches of Grace: Treaſures of Wiſdom: Exceeding Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Power</hi>! That it contains ſuch won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful diſplays of the Divine Perfections, that the <hi>Angels deſire to ſtoop down and look into it,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.12. that they may have freſh oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions to excite their <hi>Praiſes.</hi> How can we
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:001939_0110_0FBA23D761D7E120"/>
enough bewail the ſtupidity, earthlineſs and ſottiſh inconſiderateneſs of our hearts? that are looking upon other objects with eſteem and admiration, while this great deſign of divine Wiſdom and Love is no more admir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, eſteemed and delighted in by us. But to excite hereunto, <hi>Conſider</hi> Two or Three Things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. THIS is <hi>one ſpecial way of putting honour upon God for it,</hi> to entertain high and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable thoughts of it. God's laſt and higheſt end in all his Works is his <hi>own Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> and it ſeem'd good to the divine Wiſdom to pitch upon this way for the manifeſtation of it; and he will be admir'd in and for it throughout the days of Eternity. Now none can doubt but that they, for whom theſe great things are done ſhould be peculiarly concerned to give him the glory of it. Did the bleſſed God deſign to glorify himſelf in this work, to give occaſion to Men and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels to do it? How unworthy a thing will it be if we don't fall in with this great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign? Now we ſhall not do this if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent our ſelves with ſome formal verbal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements of God for it, and han't hearts deeply <hi>affected with it,</hi> and don't <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire</hi> the <hi>Divine Perfections</hi> ſhining in it. If we don't often view with wonder and praiſe the glory of his Grace and Love in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:001939_0111_0FBA23D8C485BED0"/>
and Humiliation of the Son of God, the glorious diſcoveries of his Holineſs, Truth, Juſtice, Wiſdom and Power, the ſweet concurrence of his ſeveral <hi>Attributes,</hi> and the luſtre they caſt one upon another in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on this great deſign, and the immenſe and infinite <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of God that appears in the gracious effects procured for us by it. How juſtly offended was God with the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Iſrael</hi> when they loſt a ſenſe of his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in their deliverance from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; that <hi>they remembred not the multitude of his mercies</hi>; nor the great things he had wrought for them. Yet this was but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Mercy, and a <hi>ſhadow</hi> of this glorious Work: therefore not to admire God in this will be the blackeſt ingratitude. What greater thing can be ſuppos'd that God ſhould ever do to endear himſelf to us, and engage the higheſt eſteem of him, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to put honour upon him, then he hath done in this aſtoniſhing work?</p>
               <p n="2">2. DUE apprehenſions and admirations of the Divine Glory appearing in this great Work <hi>will be greatly ſubſervient to your own comfort.</hi> It will be a good evidence of your intereſt in the priviledges of Redemption. It is ever the <hi>property</hi> of thoſe that have been ſharers of this deliverance from ſin and wrath to have high thoughts of their Deliverer,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:001939_0112_0FBA23DA5651E9B8"/>
and of the ways and means whereby deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance hath been brought about. 1 Pet. 2.7. <hi>Unto you that believe he is precious.</hi> The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition is convertible: They to whom Chriſt is precious do believe: a high valuation of Chriſt in his Perſon, Offices, Benefits, is ever a concomitant of Faith, and evidential of it. They who have been led into the ſpiritual underſtanding of the Glory of the Perſon of Chriſt, the acceptableneſs of his Obedience, the ſufficiency of his Satisfaction, the glory of divine Wiſdom, in the contrivance and carrying on the work of our Redemption, will and do undoubtedly cloſe with it, and actually depend upon this glorious Saviour. Men ſhew their dependance upon created helps by their high thoughts of the ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of them. Such a high eſteem of the ſufficiency and excellency of <hi>Chriſt</hi> will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover your affiance and complacency in him. Thus the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> diſcovered his intereſt in Chriſt by his tranſcendent reſpect to and eſteem of him, Phil. 3.8. <hi>I count all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord.</hi> And thus the ſincere Chriſtian, repreſented by the <hi>wiſe Merchant,</hi> is characterized by his tranſcendent eſteem of Chriſt, and willingneſs to part with all for him, Mat. 13.45, 6. <hi>The kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven is like unto a merchant-man ſeeking goodl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>USE III.</hi> IS the Salvation which the Goſpel reveals <hi>ſo Great and Glorious,</hi> as you have heard, <hi>Be hence exhorted, to ſecure an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it.</hi> This is the great deſign of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of it; this is the unqueſtionable duty of thoſe that have the offer of it made to them. If this be not your ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and endeavour, you <hi>receive the Grace of God in vain,</hi> are nothing the better for the diſcovery of it. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners.</hi> 'Tis no fiction or idle report, but that which is true and certain; and what ſinners have the higheſt reaſon to buſy themſelves about, and be deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for. The report of it is juſtly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and ſhould be welcome to periſhing ſinners. Had the deliverance been a great deal leſs then it is, it had been worthy of acceptance: had it been only a reprieve from <hi>Hell</hi> for ſome <hi>Hundreds of Years,</hi> or a releaſe from it after ſo many Years enduring the torment and miſery of it: this had been worthy of acceptance. Men are willing to
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:001939_0114_0FBA23E69B42E990"/>
take a great deal of pains for a few Years comfort. If it had been only ſome <hi>mitiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Curſe</hi> that <hi>Chriſt</hi> had obtained for us, much more if there had been a total re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe and diſcharge from the ſufferings of it, tho' there had been no future happineſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to have been expected; if ſinful Man might have been <hi>annihilated,</hi> &amp; made uncapable of ſin or miſery, this conſidering what an evil ſin is, and what dreadful and aſtoniſhing mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries it brings with it, had been worthy of our thankful acceptance. But when far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond theſe God is pleaſed to provide a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, whereby we may have not a <hi>partial</hi> but a <hi>full deliverance</hi> from all the effects of <hi>Sin,</hi> and be made partakers of peace and friendſhip with God, to enjoy all needful <hi>Spiritual bleſſings,</hi> and to be ſharers with <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels</hi> in the <hi>everlaſting fruition of God</hi> in <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Glory</hi>! This ought to be moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſought after by all that have the offer of it made unto them. Now to <hi>urge</hi> this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

And can theſe be more neceſſary then the <hi>Bread of Life,</hi> or the <hi>Garments of Salvation?</hi> What ſhall become of you if Chriſt ben't a Saviour to you? God han't left Men to have their choice of ſeveral ways whereby they may be accepted, juſtified and ſaved: but he hath limited it to this; if you don't obtain Salvation upon the terms of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel there's no hope of being ſaved at all. There never were but <hi>two ways</hi> propoſed to Man by which he might obtain <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> either by <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>ſinleſs Obedience</hi>; or by the <hi>Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt</hi>: either by the <hi>works of the Law,</hi> or the <hi>Grace of Chriſt</hi> appearing in the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> of theſe is become impoſſible to Man in his now fallen eſtate: none that underſtand themſelves or the Law, can pretend to put in any plea for life upon the <hi>terms</hi> of the <hi>Firſt Covenant. The whole world is become guilty before God,</hi> Rom. 3.19. and are obnoxious to the curſe and condemnation of a broken Law. <hi>By the works of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified,</hi> Gal. 2.16. None of the race of ſinful Man, how blameleſly, ſoberly, conſcienciouſly ſoever they have liv'd, have been able to put in

any plea for life, that might be accepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God. It is <hi>the righteouſneſs of Chriſt alone</hi> that can profit a guilty creature to procure ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and acceptance for him before God; this only can endure the trial of God's Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal.

                  <hi>preſumption:</hi> but that it be diligently and thankfully improv'd, that you may be led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the underſtanding of the Glory of Chriſt in his Natures, Perſon, and Offices: might have right apprehenſions of the riches of divine Grace and Love: might have your deſires after this Salvation ſuitably enflam'd and directed: that after ſuch wonderful <hi>Grace hath appeared,</hi> you might not periſh in your ſins.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>GOD graciouſly tenders this Salvation to you, and is ſtill perſwading your acceptance of it.</hi> There is a <hi>ſpecial Providence</hi> of God directing the diſpenſation of the Goſpel, both as to the times and places where it ſhall be afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The <hi>Apoſtles Journeys</hi> were ordered by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as you may ſee, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.26, — <hi>Chap.</hi> 16.7. Now by the gracious deſignati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and choices of Providences it is brought and laid before you.

An accepted time and a day of Salvation</hi>! And great reaſon there is to acknowledge the diſtinguiſhing Grace of God in this matter toward you: when ſo many are to be found in the World covered with ignorance and

barbariſm, and what <hi>Superſtitions</hi> and <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies</hi> prevail even in Chriſtianized parts of the World. But eſpecially the condeſcention of God is aſtoniſhing, that he hath not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented himſelf barely to reveal it, but to <hi>preſs and urge</hi> your acceptance of it, with the moſt proper and forcible <hi>Arguments.</hi> Yea to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his <hi>Ambaſſadors</hi> to entreat Sinners to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the offer that is made; as in that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful expreſſion, 2 Cor. 5.20. <hi>As though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſts ſtead he ye reconciled to God.</hi> The great and glorious God who neither wants the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or ſervice of any of his Creatures is pleas'd to become a ſuitor for them, to uſe the moſt melting arguments with them, to purſue their own happineſs; by accepting the Grace provided in Chriſt. Now let your own Judgment and Conſciences determine whether it ben't a moſt becoming and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable thing, that you ſhould put a due va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon the offer! that you mayn't be guilty of receiving <hi>the Grace of God in vain</hi>; and ill requiting of ſuch great and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mercy. God doth not offer it to you out of neceſſity, but out of choice and by way of trial. So that both his <hi>Mercy</hi> and your <hi>own Intereſt</hi> ſhould oblige you to accept of it. If you ſlight God's offers, he can find thoſe that will be glad of them. As the

                  <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaid to them, Acts 28.28. <hi>The Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of God is ſent unto the Gentiles, and they will hear it.</hi> And eſpecially ſhould this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument prevail, conſidering how long this offer hath been neglected: how often Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel offers have been repeated without ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs. How long the arms of Mercy have been ſtretched out in vain to you: how many Calls have been refuſed: how ill you have requited the Lord for his Mercy. Shall it ſtill be ſo? Can you find in your hearts to tire out Divine Patience, to trample upon Divine Mercy, and to refuſe your own happineſs, to hearken to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnaring deluſions of the grand Enemy of your Souls, notwithſtanding all the care God hath taken to promote the Salvation of them? Who can expreſs the ſin and folly of refuſing Salvation thus graciouſly provided and ſo freely offered and brought to your doors? It was this gave occaſion to that <hi>paſſionate lamentation</hi> of Chriſt over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> becauſe they <hi>knew not the time of their viſitation,</hi> Luk. 19.42.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>YOUR neglect of Salvation will be very ſinful and inexcuſable.</hi> The ſinfulneſs of it is manifeſt in its contrariety to the expreſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Divine Will diſcovering your duty; and its aggravated by the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Light and fulneſs of Grace mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted

What more can be deſired to perſwade and convince the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and conſciences of Men of the truth of the Goſpel, and of the ſincerity of God in the offer of it, than what God hath done? And how inexcuſable then will be your ſin if you neglect it? You can't pretend you did not know of it, or that Salvation was to be expected in any other way, or that there wanted ſufficient aſſurance of the truth of the Goſpel; or that you had not a warrant to look for an intereſt in the bleſſings of it. Much leſs will you be able to <hi>plead</hi> that you had buſineſs of greater weight and neceſſity to buſy your time and thoughts about: that you had no leiſure to apply your ſelf to it. <hi>Every mouth will be ſtop'd</hi> in the great Trial. But <hi>Goſpel Sinners</hi> will be moſt of all inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable and ſelf-condemned. It is certain that if you can't ſatisfy your Conſciences now, you will be much leſs able to clear your ſelves before God hereafter.</p>

                  <hi>I proceed to the Fourth</hi> Propoſition. <hi>PROPOSITION IV.</hi> HOW Great and Glorious ſoever the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is that the Goſpel reveals, it is by too many Neglected.</head>
               <p>THE <hi>Apoſtle</hi> evidently intimates this by the <hi>ſuppoſal</hi> that he makes of the fearful hazard that will be conſequent upon it. This is a truth too frequently obvious to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that there is often ground to renew the <hi>Prophets</hi> complaint, Iſai. 53.1. <hi>Who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved our report.</hi> From one Age and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to another it hath been thus, among thoſe that the <hi>Goſpel</hi> hath been Preached to. This is a diſmal proof of the deplorable ſtate of Man by the Fall, which hath not only brought guilt and wrath upon him, but a fearful blindneſs and obſtinacy; a moſt wretched averſion from God; that though he is periſhing for want of Salvation, yet when it is brought him, and moſt graciouſly tendred, he hath not a heart to accept it and cloſe with the offer of it. This gave occaſion to thoſe <hi>complaints</hi> of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Mat. 23.37. <hi>How often would I have gathered you, and ye would not.</hi> Joh. 5.40. Life was to be

had by Chriſt but they cared not for it, would not come to Chriſt for it: it is too much the ſpirit of Men ſtill. Salvation is provided by Chriſt, revealed in the Goſpel, offered to Men in the <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> urged upon them by the <hi>motions of the Holy Spirit,</hi> and the voice of their own <hi>Conſciences.</hi> But yet there are abundance who are nothing the better for it, who obtain no peace or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, no grace or comfort by it. Now this ariſes from the neglect of it: not improving the opportunities and offers of it that are afforded them.</p>
               <p>UNDER this <hi>Propoſition</hi> it may be ſhewed,</p>
               <p n="1">
                  <hi>I.</hi> THAT it is ſo, or <hi>that many to whom the offers of Salvation are made do neglect it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">II. <hi>WHENCE it comes to paſs, that they do ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>THAT many do neglect the Salvation that be Goſpel Offers.</hi> This is the <hi>Caſe,</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>OF thoſe that ſlight and diſregard the offers of it, when made to them.</hi> We read of ſuch, Mat. 22.5. Who when <hi>invited</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in the priviledges of the Goſpel, <hi>made light of it</hi>; heard it as a matter of little uſe and concern to them. There are too many careleſs inconſiderate ſleepy hearers of the Word; that hear as if they heard not, don't
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:001939_0125_0FBA24074481C348"/>
ſeriouſly regard the Meſſages ſent them by God from day to day: they don't attend to <hi>the things that are ſpoken</hi> as ſuch whereon their eternal welfare depends. It's ſtrange to ſee what <hi>ignorance</hi> there is in many about the neceſſary <hi>Doctrines</hi> of Salvation that are often inculcated upon them; and what <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibleneſs</hi> and ſottiſhneſs there is in many more, of the worth of that Salvation which the Goſpel reveals. This comes to paſs from their not minding and weighing the truths that are delivered to them. How many live as if they were only born for time, and the intereſts and pleaſures of the preſent Life, and had nothing to do for Eternity? Hence they ſpend their days in mirth and jollity, their lives are a continual diverſion, from one carnal pleaſure and delight to another, their thoughts run continually upon theſe things, that they regard no propoſals that are made to them of things that refer to their <hi>Eternal ſafety</hi> and welfare. Are ſottiſhly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the ſtate their <hi>Souls</hi> are in. A <hi>ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of deep ſleep</hi> is fallen upon them: they will own that they are <hi>Sinners</hi>; but their being ſo is no burthen, no terror to them. And hence though they hear of a <hi>Saviour</hi>; and all his glorious ſufficiency is ſet before them to remove their guilt and reſtore their Souls. Yet <hi>they</hi> mind it not, lay no weight upon it.</p>
               <p n="2">

That don't ſet themſelves in good earneſt to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the terms and method in which it may be obtained. Many have a ſuperficial knowledge of the Doctrine of the Goſpel, being all their days educated under it: yet are negligent in improving it. They have no delight to employ their minds in medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on it, or to know the Spirit, and feel the power of it upon their hearts: don't by ſerious conſideration ſet themſelves to get an underſtanding of the excellency and ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of it to their condition, and of what importance it is to them: how much the command of God and a reſpect to their own ſafety and welfare obliges them to hearken to the propoſals of it, and to make it their preſent ſerious concern to have a ſpecial and real intereſt in it; that <hi>Chriſt</hi> with <hi>all his Benefits</hi> may be theirs; and they may be ſharers in the glorious priviledges of <hi>Pardon, Peace, Holineſs,</hi> and a <hi>Title to Eternal Life</hi> by <hi>him.</hi> Some have a deſire to be ſav'd, now and then have a <hi>good pang</hi> upon them, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſome concern about it under ſome a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening Truth, or Providence that they
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:001939_0127_0FBA2410428FAB90"/>
meet with: but for the moſt part it is a matter of indifferency to them; their minds are intent upon other matters, and they can content themſelves to live in a ſtate of eſtrangement from God, without any intereſt in the graces of his Spirit, or any <hi>well-grounded hope</hi> in his Promiſes. That which ſhould be their grand concern, and purſued with the greateſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of mind is laid aſide, and other things are preferred before it. They can't tell how to be contented to want Corn and Cattle, and Lands, or ſuch worldly intereſts, conveniences and honours that they ſee o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers enjoy: but they can bear it well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to want ſpiritual and eternal mercies. Theſe things not being obvious to ſenſe, ſeem to them like the <hi>Poets</hi> Elizeum, but as a <hi>dream or fancy.</hi>

to be neceſſary, they would not dare to die without it; but they ſee not a preſent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, but as <hi>Felix</hi> dealt with his Convictions under the <hi>Apoſtles Preaching</hi>; defer'd them to <hi>a more convenient ſeaſon</hi>; ſo they put off this great duty of <hi>believing in Chriſt,</hi> 'till ſome other buſineſſes are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd, or 'till the approach of <hi>Death.</hi> They truly neglect the Salvation of the Goſpel that neglect to improve the Seaſon allotted to them for the obtaining of it.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) <hi>THOSE that are under the power of an unbelieving heart.</hi> 'Tis a fruit of the natural corruption of the heart, to diſcredit and queſtion God's Truth, as well as to reſiſt his Authority. And Men are very prone when they hear of the abundant Grace of God in Chriſt towards Sinners, to queſtion the truth of the report, to doubt whether the thing be ſo or not; to contract the infiniteneſs of God's Mercy and Chriſt's Merit: and to look upon the offers made them too great to be true. They are ready to meaſure God by themſelves, and to think him prone to Revenge and ſlow to Mercy: their guilt ſills them with jealouſies and ſuſpicions of God; they look upon him as one <hi>hard to be intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> and that Mercy is with great difficulty wreſted from him; they muſt do ſome great thing to procure it, and move God to the
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:001939_0129_0FBA24128D039AA0"/>
exerciſe of it, or they may'nt expect it: or though ſome others whoſe ſins han't been of ſuch a heinous nature, ſo circumſtanc'd and aggravated as theirs have been, may hope for favour from God &amp; acceptance in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> yet think they may'nt dare to do it; they don't look upon themſelves to be Perſons in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the offer that is made; that it would be <hi>too much boldneſs</hi> and arrogance in them to venture upon it; they dare not ſtay on Chriſt as a ſure <hi>Anchor</hi> againſt all the toſſings of fear and temptation, ariſing from the ſenſe of their own guilt and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but are like a Ship toſt upon the waves. This is not ſo openly frequent among us as <hi>Preſumption</hi> and Security, there being more <hi>Preſumers</hi> than <hi>Deſpairers.</hi> But yet it is the caſe of many who ſpend their days in fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs complaints and <hi>dejection of Spirit</hi>; who entertain and cheriſh jealouſies of God, and of the authority and divinity of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and of the ſufficiency of the Grace &amp; Power of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as though there were not ſhelter enough <hi>under his Wings</hi> to defend them.</p>

                  <hi>II.</hi> I proceed to ſhew, <hi>Whence, it is that ſo many neglect this Great Salvation.</hi> There are abundance of blameable cauſes to which it might be aſſign'd.</p>
               <p>I ſhall only <hi>hint</hi> at the more <hi>General.</hi>
               </p>

                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:001939_0130_0FBA24141DE83830"/>1. <hi>A prevailing love to ſome Luſt.</hi> The Luſts of Men frequently have a great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in their affections, <hi>Partly,</hi> from their ſuitableneſs to their corrupt natures; <hi>partly,</hi> through cuſtom in the ſervice of them: and <hi>partly,</hi> from the many carnal advantages which they propoſe to themſelves by them. Mens luſts are dear to them. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented in <hi>Scripture</hi> ſometimes by <hi>a right hand</hi> or <hi>a right eye.</hi> Hence they <hi>roll them as a ſweet morſel under their tongues.</hi> They hide and ſpare them, and <hi>will not let them go.</hi> Men will venture abundance from their love to them. 'Tis out of love to their luſts that ſome will blaſt their <hi>Reputation.</hi> Others will ruine their <hi>Eſtates</hi>; grieve their <hi>Friends,</hi> wound their <hi>Conſciences,</hi> impair their <hi>Bodies</hi>: and it is from their exceſſive love to them that many will expoſe their <hi>Souls to periſh for ever.</hi> They are not willing that <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſhould be a <hi>Jeſus</hi> to them to <hi>ſave them from their ſins</hi>; that he ſhould exert the power of his Grace in mortifying their luſts; they could be glad to be ſav'd from <hi>Hell,</hi> but they can't bear to part from ſome ſweet <hi>boſom ſins</hi>; they are got into a way of <hi>Wantonneſs,</hi> or a way of <hi>Intemperance,</hi> or a way of <hi>Diſhoneſty,</hi> or a way of <hi>Worldlineſs,</hi> and the profit or pleaſure of theſe luſts blinds them. They are <hi>hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> They could be
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:001939_0131_0FBA241DE9E85138"/>
glad of <hi>Chriſt</hi> to pacify their conſciences, but they muſt have their luſts to gratify their corrupt and carnal affections. They are not willing that Chriſt ſhould do the whole work of a Saviour for them, which is in effect to refuſe that he ſhould do any part of it: For the receiving of and ſubmitting to <hi>Chriſt</hi> in all his <hi>Offices</hi> is a condition indiſpenſibly requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to our partaking of the benefit of his Sufferings and Mediation. Now Mens na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural averſion hereunto, and their ſtrong and fixed <hi>love to ſin</hi> is the reaſon why abundance of Perſons neglect and refuſe the Salvation which the Goſpel offers to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>AN immoderate deſire of and an inordinate complacency in the lawful enjoyments of the World,</hi> is another cauſe of it. Worldly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts are preſent and ſenſible, ſuch things as Men find a want of, and taſte ſweetneſs in: therefore the temptations from them is the more forcible: Their cares for the preſent life, makes Men neglect a future. Things of <hi>Time</hi> are ſo preſſing and urgent, that <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Mercies are but little accounted of. This is repreſented to us, <hi>Luk.</hi> 14.17, — 20. This was then, and ſtill is the great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to Mens prizing and accepting of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> Fears of <hi>Poverty</hi> prevail more upon them than fears of <hi>Damnation.</hi> Deſires of
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:001939_0132_0FBA24200A218D38"/>
                  <hi>Grandeur and Pomp of living,</hi> or to equal or out-ſhine their Neighbours in Riches and Honours is of more value to them then to have their <hi>Souls adorn'd</hi> with <hi>Grace,</hi> and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd and <hi>prepared for Glory.</hi> Their heads and hands are ſo full of their worldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and they are ſo wholly ſwallowed up in the thoughts and cares about it, that they have no heart or time to think of the ſtate of their Souls, or to provide for the future welfare of them; they live as if they were born only to mind the intereſts of <hi>back and belly,</hi> and after a while <hi>like the beaſts to periſh,</hi> and be forgotten for ever. Hence it comes to paſs that many who have ſome Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the guilt of ſin, and the dangerous ſtate of their Souls, and their need of Chriſt, quench and ſuppreſs theſe Convictions from <hi>worldly</hi> conſiderations. They can't liſten to them till this or the other deſign and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they have in hand for the World, is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched. 'Tis the prevalency of this ſpirit that makes ſome Men neglect duties of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in their <hi>Families</hi> or <hi>Cloſets</hi>; and to omit <hi>ſpiritual opportunities</hi> that might be for Soul advantage; that makes <hi>others</hi> cold and dead and dull and formal in what they do in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. Something is carried on as the <hi>World</hi> will give leave, in a ſleepy, cuſtomary way, that is neither pleaſing to God nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:001939_0133_0FBA2421981BB508"/>
to themſelves. This <hi>worldly ſpirit</hi> is as great a hindrance to the Souls of Men in this great duty as any one thing ſeems to be; and its to be fear'd is the principal cauſe of it at <hi>this day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. IT ariſes alſo from <hi>cauſeleſs prejudices which Man take up againſt the way of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or the means of the application of it.</hi> Our Saviour (<hi>Mat.</hi> 11.6.) pronounces ſuch <hi>bleſſed</hi> as are <hi>not offended in him</hi>; too many are, and thereby further their own miſery. Some take offence at the ſtrict and ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying terms of the Goſpel; they are loath to <hi>ſell all</hi> for the <hi>Pearl of great price.</hi> They hear they muſt part with <hi>every luſt,</hi> and they may be put upon it to part with their <hi>dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enjoyments</hi> for Chriſt's ſake. This they are loth to engage themſelves to. Some are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced at the <hi>ſtrictneſs</hi> of a <hi>Spiritual Life.</hi> They would have more liberty than <hi>Chriſt</hi> will allow. Chriſt doth not abridge Men of any lawful liberty, but ſome Men will take a <hi>licentious liberty.</hi> The great objection that abundance have againſt Chriſt is, that <hi>they will not have him to rule over them,</hi> Luk 10.27. The <hi>Laws of Chriſt</hi> are too ſtrict for them.

It is indeed no reaſonable vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of thoſe that neglect the Profeſſion of Chriſt and Subjection to him, becauſe ſome that own him carry it badly; for we are forewarn'd that there will be <hi>Hypocrites</hi> in the <hi>viſible Church.</hi> The Laws of Chriſt give no countenance to theſe misbehaviours; but yet too many nouriſh a baſe and vile opinion of <hi>Religion</hi> upon this account, and reject the propoſals of it: and not only the looſe and vain take offence at it, but ſometimes thoſe that have had ſome impreſſions of Religion upon their hearts grow ſhy of it upon this account. <hi>Some</hi> are prejudiced againſt the <hi>Inſtruments</hi> by whom the offer of Salvation is brought to them. Either ſome <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral imperfection</hi> they have to object againſt them, their outward meanneſs or infirmities; or it may be ſome <hi>perſonal grudge</hi> they have taken up againſt them; they don't regard the <hi>Meſſage</hi> becauſe they ſlight and diſ-eſteem the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> that brings it. Thus the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſtumbled at the <hi>outward mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> becauſe they were Men of no note and fame in the World.</p>

IT is in many <hi>upon the account of a legal temper and ſpirit that prevails in them.</hi> Such a ſpirit there is in Men naturally, and indeed univerſally inclining them to ſeek <hi>Juſtification</hi> by <hi>their own works.</hi> Every Man comes into the World under the obligation of that <hi>Covenant,</hi> and naturally runs to it for Life: is attempting to do ſomething that may anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer his obligation, and abate the rigour and ſeverity of the Law that is in force againſt him; and <hi>partly,</hi> from the <hi>pride</hi> of his heart whereby he is ready to over-value his own ſervices, &amp; think them much better than real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are. A ſpirit of <hi>ſelf-love</hi> is apt to blind Men, that they can't ſee their own defects, and it is a thing Men are exceeding prone to, to chooſe to live upon their own <hi>poor ſtock</hi> rather then to be beholden to <hi>others</hi> for relief in their neceſſities: they had rather have a few <hi>rags</hi> of their own then be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to <hi>Chriſt</hi> for the <hi>Robes of his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi>: And it is <hi>partly</hi> from <hi>ignorance,</hi> not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding the excellency and ſufficiency of Chriſts Righteouſneſs, or its acceptableneſs to God, unto the end for which it is propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed; not underſtanding or being ſatisfied with the glorious deſign of God to exalt his <hi>Grace</hi> in the <hi>free Juſtification</hi> of a Sinner by the <hi>imputation of Chriſt's Righteouſneſs</hi> alone, without the <hi>works of the Law.</hi> This was the
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:001939_0137_0FBA242D877AA858"/>
caſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> at the firſt Preaching of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> Rom. 10.3. No Doctrine was more diſreliſh'd by them than this of Juſtification by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt thro' Faith. And it is this <hi>Doctrine</hi> that the great <hi>enemy of God's Grace,</hi> both in the times of <hi>Popery,</hi> and ſince by other <hi>Inſtruments</hi> hath endeavoured to obſcure and reſiſt; and he finds the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt hearts of Men ready to fall in with this deſign. It is the caſe of <hi>awakened Sinners,</hi> who are deeply concern'd for Salvation to withſtand the way which the Goſpel reveals by Chriſt; and ſo reject the promiſe for <hi>want of ſuitable qualifications in themſelves.</hi> They would fain get better hearts, better frames and affections, do duties in a better manner: if once they could prepare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for Chriſt, they would venture upon him: but for want of ſuch preparations they neglect and are afraid to do it.</p>

<pb n="130" facs="unknown:001939_0139_0FBA2433476D36F0"/>
God hath ſignally appeared towards us, in giving us the priviledges of the Goſpel, which are denied to abundance of others in the World; and the Salvation herein revealed and propoſed hath been already ſhewed; the bleſſings and Promiſes of it are of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and eternal nature, and therefore of higheſt importance to the Souls of Men. The things which Chriſt tenders to ſinners by it, are reconciliation with God, remiſſion of Sin, redemption from the curſe of the Law, a title to Eternal Life, and to all the felicity that the Eternal Fruition of God in a ſtate of Heavenly Glory can afford; but how few comparatively prize it, regard it, and are concern'd to have an intereſt in it. The glad tidings of the Goſpel grow ſtale and common in our times; it is other News that Men generally liſten after, it is the world and worldly enjoyments and intereſts that Men are enquiring after, and buſying themſelves about. The <hi>favour of God,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life</hi> ſeem to be ſmall and inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things in compariſon with the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations they have from the World. The prevailing of <hi>ſuch a ſpirit</hi> calls for our <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and ſhould be <hi>for a Lamentation,</hi> and that on <hi>ſeveral Accounts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. ON account of the <hi>greatneſs of the Sin.</hi> It is a <hi>Sin</hi> that hath the greateſt <hi>ingratitude</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="unknown:001939_0140_0FBA24384AFA5168"/>
unkindneſs in it: it is a <hi>ſin</hi> againſt the <hi>freeſt Love</hi> and <hi>richeſt Mercy</hi> that ever was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the World, and therefore muſt needs have a great deal of provocation in it. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in our <hi>Context,</hi> and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.28, 9. ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravates it by a compariſon taken from <hi>ſins againſt the Law.</hi> The bold tranſgreſſions of the Law were puniſh'd with the <hi>Death of the tranſgreſſor</hi>; but the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> puts a <hi>how much more!</hi> unto the <hi>voluntary tranſgreſſions againſt the Goſpel</hi>: and in proportion the ſlighting and neglecting the Grace tender'd in the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> will bring an anſwerable degree of puniſhment: even <hi>wrath to the uttermoſt</hi>! What wonderful love was it that when the <hi>whole World was become guilty before God,</hi> and nothing but certain Death could have been expected by any of the ſinful Children of Men: That then the <hi>kindneſs and love of God ſhould ſo appear,</hi> as to ſend his <hi>own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh,</hi> to be a Surety and Sacrifice for us? to be <hi>made ſin,</hi> and <hi>a curſe for us,</hi> to take upon himſelf the obligation we were under to diſcharge it in our ſtead, in ſuch a coſtly way as by the <hi>offering of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> to make expiation for our Sin? and not only to procure deliverance from ſin and all the penal effects of it, but to purchaſe and offer Eternal Life and Glory in the World to come: That God ſhould ſingle out you to

be the ſubjects of theſe offers, what aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Grace is this! How great then is the <hi>ingratitude</hi> to ſlight, diſregard and neglect the offer of it? that you ſhould carry your ſelf ſo towards <hi>God</hi> as if his <hi>Image</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> were things of little worth! towards <hi>Chriſt</hi> as if he ſpent his Life and endur'd his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings for things of very little value and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count? not worth your eſteem and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance! How highly are Men offended of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten times when their favours are ſlighted. And how much more may the bleſſed God, when ſuch rich and glorious offers as he makes, are not regarded by the Children of Men.</p>
               <p n="2">2. ON account of the <hi>ſad effects this ſin is attended with, even in this world, and thoſe judgments that it brings with it.</hi> When the <hi>Jews</hi> rejected <hi>Chriſt,</hi> God <hi>deſtroyed</hi> that <hi>Nation</hi> by aſtoniſhing Judgments.

<pb n="133" facs="unknown:001939_0142_0FBA243D4D381820"/>
out: But there's reaſon to conclude that one main branch of God's controverſy with us, is the <hi>not prizing and accepting the Grace of Chriſt offered in the Goſpel.</hi> Our <hi>Blood</hi> hath been <hi>ſpilt as water upon the ground,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Blood of Chriſt</hi> hath been ſo lightly eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The jealouſie of God hath been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked to <hi>blaſt</hi> thoſe things which have been <hi>idoliz'd</hi> and prefer'd before <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Grace of God by him. There is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ground to conclude that God is angry for this upon a <hi>double account. Partly,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>general prevalency of this ſin.</hi> As to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other ſins there are but few comparative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly chargeable with them. But the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecters of the Great Salvation preach'd to, and preſs'd upon Men in the Goſpel are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; they are to be found in all our <hi>Towns,</hi> from one end of the <hi>Land</hi> to another. It is the <hi>prevailing ſin</hi> of our days. We may take up the <hi>Prophets</hi> complaint, Iſai. 53.1. <hi>Who hath believed our report?</hi> The minds and thoughts of the moſt are intent upon other things. The <hi>general cry</hi> is, <hi>What ſhall we eat, What ſhall we drink?</hi> &amp;c. Not, <hi>What muſt we do to be ſaved?</hi> And <hi>partly,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>influence and tendency that this hath to draw Men to, and harden them in other ſins.</hi> Did Perſons duly underſtand and conſider how great a bleſſing Salvation from ſin is, and
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:001939_0143_0FBA243EC28A0258"/>
improve the help offered them by Chriſt for that end, it would be their care to watch againſt it, to mortify it, to reſiſt and ſuppreſs the motions of it, and not indulge and cheriſh it as now they do. But this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the Grace of Chriſt and over-valuing the things of the World diſpoſes Men to <hi>Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion</hi> and <hi>Unrighteouſneſs,</hi> to entrench upon God's <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> to omit <hi>Duties of Worſhip</hi> in their <hi>Cloſets</hi> or <hi>Families</hi>; or to be ſlight and ſuperficial in them, to <hi>neglect ſpiritual Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities,</hi> to grow weary of God's <hi>Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> becauſe of the labour and charge of them. It diſpoſes Men to acts of unrighteouſneſs, to defraud, over-reach and injure their Neighbours, to break their Promiſes, to be uncharitable and covetous. <hi>All</hi> muſt <hi>bow</hi> to this <hi>admired idol.</hi> This ſin is fruitful and not only produces abundance of other ſins, but keeps Men from the only remedy and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative from all ſin; and is in its nature moſt vile, as being oppoſite to what is God's greateſt deſign, to exalt the Glory of his Grace towards ſinners by Jeſus Chriſt. So that it is no wonder that the anger of God is ſo awfully manifeſted on account the of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IN regard of the <hi>certain and fearful dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſuch Perſons are in of Eternal Judgments.</hi> It is a ſin that not only provokes God to
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:001939_0144_0FBA2448DE59BEB0"/>
ſhorten Men's lives, to put an end to their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Goſpel Light and Grace, to bring many outward Calamities upon Men in this World, but it will alſo bring upon them <hi>fearful and unavoidable deſtruction</hi> in the World to come. If this way of Salvation be neglected, there is no remedy, no way to eſcape remaining for guilty ſinners: God hath provided no other Sacrifice for ſin: and if you continue impenitent and unbelieving, that doth moſt certainly cut you off from any claim to the benefits of Chriſt. The <hi>Law of Faith,</hi> like that of the <hi>Medes</hi> &amp; <hi>Perſians may no man reverſe. He that believeth not the ſon, ſhall not ſee life. Except</hi> Men <hi>repent, they muſt periſh.</hi> Unbelief is eminently the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſin that certainly damns ſinners, and leaves them to have <hi>Judgment without Mercy.</hi> It is not the preparation of a ſovereign re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy that cures a diſeaſe, but the <hi>application</hi> of it. The Righteouſneſs and Spirit of Chriſt however ſufficient for the ends to which they are provided; yet they convey no pardon life and comfort to any Soul, that is not by <hi>Faith</hi> united to Chriſt. It is not from any defect of Mercy in God or Merit in Chriſt that ſo many periſh, but from their obſtinate refuſal of it. That <hi>precious Blood</hi> which in itſelf <hi>ſpeaks better things</hi> then the Blood of <hi>Abel,</hi> calls for Mercy upon penitent and believing
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:001939_0145_0FBA244A65520FD8"/>
ſinners, calls aloud for vengeance and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation upon the heads of the unbelieving and impenitent; and ſuch muſt expect the amazing and terrible executions of them. Now how greatly to be lamented is this, that the laſt end of ſo many of the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Children of <hi>Adam</hi> will be to <hi>periſh for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi>? Temporal miſeries that ſome endure are very ſorrowful; the ſpiritual Judgments that others undergo are more ſorrowful: but <hi>Eternal</hi> evils vaſtly and inconceivably exceed both. To ſee Men and Women en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with rational and underſtanding Souls, capable of eternal Bleſſedneſs and Glory, and under the gracious offers of it, inſenſible of their need of it, and regardleſs of the Grace and Love that hath done ſo much to procure it; miſerably infatuated and hardened in the love of ſinful pleaſures, and unperſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable by all counſels; voluntarily ruſhing forward to their own amazing and eternal ruine, juſtly calls for our <hi>deepeſt Lamentation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. THEY are to be lamented over on this account alſo that <hi>ther's great hazard their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities</hi> for avoiding the miſeries they are in danger of, and obtaining the mercies offered them, <hi>will quickly be gone.</hi> God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares to thoſe whom he priviledges with the light and liberty of the Goſpel as, 2 Cor.

6.1. <hi>Behold! now is the accepted time, now is the day of Salvation!</hi> And calls upon them to <hi>hear his voice</hi> while it is <hi>called to day,</hi> Heb. 3.7. But he lets Men know that tho' in reſpect of <hi>clearneſs</hi> of Light the Goſpel diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation that they are under is a <hi>Day,</hi> yet in reſpect to the <hi>ſhortneſs</hi> of it, it is <hi>but</hi> a <hi>Day,</hi> a <hi>Day</hi> that will quickly terminate, and is continually waſting. The glaſs of Patience is continually running down and will ſoon run out: whether ſinners improve it or no, its continually flying from them; many thro' their careleſsneſs have loſt much of it already: ſome are got to an <hi>advanced age,</hi> and with reſpect to nature, can't expect a much longer opportunity; and <hi>ſome</hi> by a courſe of ſinning have encreas'd their <hi>natural obſtinacy. Others</hi> have contracted <hi>evil habits,</hi> or brought themſelves under <hi>Spiritual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and have provoked God to put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod to them. Now the loſs of ſuch an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity is of doleful conſequence. It was the conſideration of this that drew out our <hi>Saviour's Tears</hi> over <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Luk. 16.44. That <hi>ſhe knew net the time of her viſitation.</hi> It is a very <hi>melancholly</hi> conſideration to ſee multitudes of Mankind, daily ſliding as it were upon the ſtream of Time into the ocean of Eternity, and in the mean while full of ſottiſh careleſsneſs, ſecurity and ſloth, not

conſidering whither they are going, or now they ſhall be diſpoſed of in that Eternal ſtate!</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE II.</hi> OF <hi>Examination,</hi> to ſtir you up to Conſider, <hi>Whether you are not guilty of this Sin of neglecting the Great Salvation which is reveal'd and offer'd to you in the Goſpel.</hi> The commonneſs of this evil, and the dangerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it may juſtly awaken all to a due ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitude in this matter. Few will acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their guilt herein; and many are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to deceive themſelves becauſe of ſome common effects of illumination, conviction or comfort, that the Goſpel hath had upon them; go away with falſe hopes that all ſhall be well.</p>
               <p>THE great <hi>ENQUIRY</hi> therefore that I would propoſe to you to put to your own Souls, is, <hi>Whether you have been brought thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to receive the bleſſings offered, and heartily to ſubmit to the terms propounded in the Goſpel?</hi> For ſurely they who don't accept the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tender'd do neglect it. How honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſoever Men ſpeak of the Goſpel and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges of it, yet if their hearts are not bowed to conſent to the offers it makes, and ſubmit to the duties it requires, they do neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it. A few <hi>Particulars</hi> may be inſiſted on for your help in this trial.</p>
               <p n="1">1. IT you have received and accepted the
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:001939_0148_0FBA245159C292F0"/>
Grace offered in the Goſpel, <hi>you do indeed value the priviledges of it.</hi> Both <hi>Chriſt</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and the <hi>Benefits</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> are precious to Believers. The priviledges of Salvation are various, and ſome of them ſome carnal Perſons may ſeem to eſteem. But to value them all, or indeed rightly to value any, is one <hi>diſtinguiſhing character</hi> of true Believers. <hi>Peace with God</hi> is one of the priviledges of the Goſpel. Carnal Men would be glad that God would not hurt them, but as for any real eſteem of his <hi>Favour,</hi> or rejoycing in his Friendſhip, prizing his Preſence or Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with him, this they are ſtrangers to: but a gracious Soul values this, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly prefers the favour of God above the <hi>increaſes of Corn and Wine,</hi> Pſal. 4.5, 6, 7. Yea accounts his <hi>loving kindneſs to be better than Life,</hi> Pſal. 63.2. The friendſhip of God is more to them then the ſmiles of all the World. The ſenſe they have of the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of it is the great inducement to a holy walking before God, and watchfulneſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any thing that may make a breach between God and them, and provoke him to hide his Face from them. Again, <hi>Liberty of Acceſs to God,</hi> as to a <hi>Father in Chriſt,</hi> that they may come and pour out their hearts un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him in all their ſtraits and neceſſities, this is a priviledge which gracious Souls have
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:001939_0149_0FBA2457DB8AEB28"/>
an high eſteem of, and do thankfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. Hence their approaches to God are not the effects of ſlaviſh fear, but of love, they come not into God's preſence as forc'd and conſtrain'd, but as delighting in it, that they may expreſs a ſenſe of his Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, and may obtain further mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations and experiences of it. Again, <hi>Another Priviledge</hi> that Believers have by Chriſt and which they are wont highly to value is, <hi>Deliverance from the reigning power and dominion of ſin.</hi> Rom. 6.14. This is a principal part of that Liberty which they enjoy by Chriſt at preſent, that by his <hi>Spirit</hi> he enables them <hi>to mortify the deeds of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> Rom. 8.13.

to continue in ſin on this hope, that the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God and Merit of Chriſt, will bear them out. God had quite another deſign in revealing his Grace to ſinners in the Goſpel. We are told what it was, Tit. 2.11, 12. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſalvation hath appeared to all men, teaching us that denying un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly righteouſly and godly in this preſent world.</hi> Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever are taught it effectually, and brought to underſtand the <hi>truth as it is in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> do learn this by it; they ſee a glory in this method of divine Grace, as it carries the ſtrongeſt arguments againſt ſin, and the moſt forcible inducements to holineſs and purity and righteouſneſs, in the courſe of their lives; and as they have been made ſenſible of their miſery by reaſon of the power as well as guilt of ſin; ſo they eſteem it their priviledge that they have the offer and promiſe of Grace by Chriſt to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the power of ſin; and to enable and aſſiſt them to walk in newneſs of life. Hence the Scripture doth ſo frequently inſiſt upon <hi>ſuch ſigns</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi>; as being the ſure and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible <hi>marks</hi> of it.

                  <hi>USE III.</hi> TO <hi>Adviſe</hi> all ſuch as have <hi>neglected the Salvation that hath been offered them in the Goſpel now to embrace it.</hi> Now hearken to the <hi>propoſals</hi> God is making to you, in order to your preſent comfort, and future happineſs.

<pb n="145" facs="unknown:001939_0154_0FBA246686F02368"/>
the Mercies it offers accepted, it will even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually prove an aggravation of Sin, and a heightening of Judgment.</p>
               <p>I ſhall offer a few Word of <hi>Advice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. SET your ſelves <hi>to ſhake off Preſumption and Security.</hi> From the prevailency and power of theſe it is that Salvation is ſo much neglected. Men <hi>preſume</hi> they have time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough before them, <hi>preſume</hi> upon the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of God, the continuance of Means, the aſſiſtances of the Spirit: all which are <hi>utterly uncertain,</hi> and not at their command. <hi>Preſume</hi> upon their good purpoſes and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions; not underſtand the <hi>deceitfulneſs and deſperate wickedneſs</hi> of their own <hi>hearts</hi>; and thro' theſe preſumptions indulge a ſpirit of <hi>ſecurity</hi> and ſloth: have no heart to take pains about their eternal welfare, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent themſelves either with <hi>lazy wiſhes</hi> or ſuperficial and <hi>formal duties.</hi> Therefore ſhake off this <hi>ſloth</hi> and abandon theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions. Conclude upon it, that now is the time of duty; now is the ſeaſon of hope: That you <hi>know not what a day may bring forth,</hi> when God will put a period to your time or ſuſpend the influences of his Spirit.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>GET the knowledge of your abſolute and preſent need of the Salvation that is offered to you.</hi> Senſe of want quickens endeavour. God hath given you many advantages to
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:001939_0155_0FBA24680D96C668"/>
know this; by his <hi>Word,</hi> by the voice of <hi>Conſcience,</hi> by his <hi>Providences,</hi> by the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions</hi> and <hi>Experiences</hi> of <hi>others.</hi> You are capable of underſtanding and paſſing a true judgment upon your ſtate and actions, to ſee the numerous ſins you have been guilty of in the courſe of your lives, to ſee the truth of the threatning and curſe of the <hi>Law</hi> that lies upon you and ſtands in force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt you, your utter impotency to fulfil the righteouſneſs or bear the penalty of it, to make any compenſation for ſin, or to give to God any ranſom for your Souls, to offer any thing to God that may be a price for Eternal Life. So that unleſs a <hi>Saviour</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe for you, there's a neceſſity of your periſhing, and it is altogether uncertain how ſoon it may be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>LABOUR after an underſtanding of the ſufficiency of the Saviour, and the ſuitableneſs of the Salvation that the Goſpel reveals, and the juſt and honourable terms upon which it is offered.</hi> Mens taking up wrong apprehenſions of <hi>theſe things,</hi> breeds prejudices and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The principal means God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be uſed to bring you to a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of theſe things, are diligent hearing and ſearching into the <hi>Word</hi> of God; and earneſt applications to God for his <hi>Spirit</hi> to inſtruct you. The <hi>Word</hi> reveals Chriſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds

the terms of Salvation, the <hi>Spirit</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens the underſtanding to ſee the truth and glory of the things reveal'd. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.39. and <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.14. There you are inform'd of the <hi>Natures, Perſon</hi> and <hi>Offices</hi> of Chriſt: How <hi>mighty he is to ſave</hi> even <hi>to the uttermoſt</hi>; of the ſins and wants, of <hi>thoſe that come to God by him</hi>; It ſhews us the compleatneſs of his Satisfaction, the acceptableneſs of his Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the prevailency of his Interceſſion, the riches of his Grace and Mercy, his readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to receive and undertake for believing Sinners, that find an utter inability to ſave themſelves. He impoſes <hi>terms</hi> that are not only <hi>juſt</hi> but <hi>honourable</hi> and <hi>gracious</hi>: he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires no part of the ſatisfaction due to the Law from the ſinner himſelf, but an <hi>intire dependance</hi> upon what he hath made by his Obedience and Sufferings; that you <hi>break off your ſins by repentance,</hi> and return to your duty to God by an entire <hi>Dedication</hi> of your ſelves, <hi>Soul, Body, Time, Intereſts,</hi> to <hi>his Glory and Praiſe</hi>; to which he encourages with the moſt <hi>great and precious Promiſes</hi> of Eternal Life and Happineſs, as the reward of it at laſt. Surely you ſhould be aſham'd of your neglects of ſo Great Salvation.</p>

               <p n="1">1.

of numerous ſins, but how many ſoever they are, they are all chargeable upon them; they have forgotten abundance of them, but God han't forgotten one of them: They are laid up in ſtore with him, and <hi>Seal'd up among his Treaſures,</hi> Deut. 32.34. The <hi>Scripture</hi> is plain as to this, that none of their ſins are pardoned, nor ſhall be whilſt they abide in their <hi>unbelief.</hi> Joh. 3.18. <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already, becauſe he hath not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on the Name of the only begotten Son of God.</hi> And Joh. 8.24. <hi>If ye believe not that I am he, ye ſhall die in your ſins.</hi> Now this is a very dreadful miſery to have the guilt of all your ſins lying upon you; to be liable to anſwer at the <hi>Bar of God</hi> (as ſhortly you muſt) for all the ſins that ever you have committed. The <hi>Guilt</hi> of ſin is a <hi>heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then.</hi> Many have cried out with bitter diſtreſs and anguiſh of ſpirit, becauſe of it in this World.

The <hi>Scripture</hi> ſpeaks largely concerning theſe things, and Men's thoughts may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiate upon them: but when they have gone to the utmoſt reach of a <hi>finite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding</hi> in ſpeaking or thinking of them, they vaſtly ſurpaſs all that can be thought or ſaid! As none can deſcribe the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Soul encircled in the Arms of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, ſo none can expreſs the miſery of a Soul ſeparated from God, and adjudg'd to the Society of <hi>Devils,</hi> and the inextinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able flames of Divine Wrath!</p>

the Goſpel of God.</q> The more Mercy Men have had and abuſed in this World, the more Wrath they muſt expect to feel in the World to come. And to add no more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Head; It will be a <hi>dreadful aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> of the miſery of ſuch to remember in how <hi>fair a way</hi> they once were for Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, how <hi>near</hi> to the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi>; and for what baſe and mean things they forfeited it: for what trifles they caſt away their <hi>Souls</hi>; and then Sinners will confeſs that the <hi>Scripture</hi> doth not miſcall them, when it terms them <hi>Fools.</hi> They will faſt enough load themſelves with the opprobrious name, that <hi>they had a price in their hands to have got wiſdom, but not a heart to improve it,</hi> Prov. 17.16.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Two or Three Things may evidence it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. BECAUSE <hi>it is an abuſe of the greateſt Love and Mercy that God ever manifeſted to the World.</hi> The Scripture ſpeaks of the love of God in the Gift of Chriſt as tranſcendent and ſuperlative, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.10. God ſhews great Mercy to Man in giving them Food and Cloathing, and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:001939_0167_0FBA2490D3A32150"/>
and comforts of Life. But Infinite love ſhines forth in the Gift of Chriſt. God had nothing greater and better to give to the World, than his <hi>Own Son,</hi> an <hi>Only Son,</hi> moſt <hi>Dear</hi> to him, One in whom he took the higheſt pleaſure and ſatisfaction; A <hi>Son</hi> that was the <hi>brightneſs of his Glory,</hi> and <hi>the expreſs Image of his Perſon.</hi> To give him to endure ſuch Sufferings, to ſubmit to ſuch a ſtate of Humiliation and Abaſement as he was pleas'd to do. For our ſakes to bear the <hi>Curſe</hi> that we might have the <hi>Bleſſing</hi>! to be made <hi>Sin</hi> that we might partake of his <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs</hi>! to <hi>Die</hi> that we might <hi>Live! for us</hi> that could never profit him, nor recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence him! to make a free offer of this Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, yea to repeat the offer, it may be <hi>Hundreds</hi> of <hi>Thouſands</hi> of Times to Sinners! and yet all this while to have this Glorious Saviour contemned, this Great Salvation trampled upon, and ſlighted, as if every triflle, vanity or luſt were more deſirable, this muſt needs provoke the heavieſt Wrath. If Men know not the worth and glory of a Saviour, how to ſet a value upon the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful wiſdom, grace and love of God that hath appeared in the way of Salvation by him, and the bleſſed priviledges of it; yet ſurely God knows the worth of theſe things, and how to adjudge a proportionable puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:001939_0168_0FBA2492E020FDA8"/>
for it. And what ſufferings of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners can bear a proportion to an indignity caſt upon ſo Glorious a Perſon? God hath ſometimes ſeverely animadverted upon thoſe that have deſpiſed his <hi>Servants</hi>: and much more may it be expected that he will be ſevere upon thoſe that <hi>don't reverence his Son.</hi> However ignorant and careleſs Sinners make light of this contempt of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of God in inflicting deſerved Vengeance for it will appear <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> in the Eyes of Angels and Saints.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BECAUSE <hi>ſuch are guilty of refuſing the only Remedy.</hi> This is the laſt and only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge or means of relief that God hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for Man's reſtoration to his Image and Favour ſince his Apoſtacy from God. We read, Rom. 8.3, 4. <hi>For what the law could not do in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin condemned ſin in the fleſh, that the righteouſneſs of the law might be fulfilled in us.</hi> When <hi>Adam</hi> the ſponſor and ſurety of the <hi>Firſt Covenant,</hi> fail'd of obtaining Life, and Men through the loſs of the Divine I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage were ſo weakened and diſabled, that they could not anſwer their obligation to it, God was pleaſed to ſubſtitute the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to procure Pardon and Life by a <hi>New
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:001939_0169_0FBA24952314C238"/>
Covenant.</hi> But in caſe this way of Salvation by Jeſus Chriſt be rejected and ſlighted, God hath made no proviſion of <hi>Another.</hi> God hath laid out the treaſures of his Wiſdom and Love in providing of this way. Grace and Mercy towards Sinners have been glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in as high a degree as we can ſuppoſe it poſſible that they ſhould. God hath <hi>no other Son</hi> to give to die in the Sinners ſtead, there was a neceſſity of Death to ſatisfy for trangreſſions againſt the Law. <hi>Without ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>f blood, there was no remiſſion.</hi> Rivers of <hi>Blood of Beaſts,</hi> that by Divine Appointment were ſhed before the great <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of Chriſt was offered, were inſufficient to expiate ſin. How then can it be thought that ſatisfaction ſhould be made by any meer Creature, when the guilt riſes higher by ſins both againſt the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Goſpel</hi> too? What can ever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate for contempt caſt upon the Blood of the Son of God? Sinners againſt the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel muſt be left quite hopeleſs. God hath provided no remedy, nor is it in their own power to provide any. Therefore their deſtruction is certain and <hi>unavoidable.</hi> Nor will the Rivers of Tears ſhed by condemned Sinners in Hell ever be able to quench the flames of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. THE certainty of it is evident becauſe <hi>the Juſtice and Truth of God requires it.</hi> The
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:001939_0170_0FBA249A469CE2E8"/>
Bleſſed God hath reſolv'd upon it, that he will glorify his Son. The <hi>Word is gone out of his mouth in righteouſneſs,</hi> and ſhall not be reverſed, <hi>that every knee ſhall bow to him.</hi> The whole World ſhall be the triumphs of his <hi>Grace</hi> or <hi>Juſtice.</hi> The <hi>Scripture</hi> contains abundance of terrible comminations againſt unbelievers. It tells us, they <hi>ſhall be damned,</hi> that they ſhall <hi>never ſee Life,</hi> that the <hi>Wrath of God abides on them,</hi> &amp;c. Now theſe threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings proceed from a God of invariable <hi>Truth,</hi> unſpotted <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and Almighty <hi>Power,</hi> and will ſurely be accompliſh'd. There is many times a <hi>ſecret hope</hi> nouriſhed in the hearts of Sinners that God will not be ſo ſtrict and ſevere as to execute his threatnings upon them, or if he doth, he will not do it in ſo terrible a manner, as he hath threatned. But theſe hopes are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous and ungrounded. God hath left no foundation for Sinners to build them upon. His threatnings are no raſh and ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den determinations as Mens often are; but are a ſanction of the Goſpel Covenant, which God in his Eternal Wiſdom and Counſel hath determined and eſtabliſhed, therefore will not recede or go back from them. God is unalterably juſt and true in his <hi>Threatnings</hi> as well as in his <hi>Promiſes. He is not a man that he ſhould lie, or the ſon of man
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:001939_0171_0FBA24A043156DC0"/>
that he ſhould repent,</hi> Jam. 1.15. There's no expectation that God will alter his mind, or that he can ever want <hi>Power</hi> to execute his threatnings. Beſides the <hi>Sufferings of Chriſt</hi> are a convincing proof of the Truth of them. God ſpar'd him not when ſin was imputed to him: there was a neceſſity that he ſhould drink the bitter Cup of Divine Wrath, that the Juſtice and Truth of God might be glorified. And if Juſtice would not ſpare the Son of God neither will it ſpare guilty Sinners. <hi>If theſe things were done in the green tree, what ſhall be done in the dry?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THESE Things may be ſufficient to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Truth before us, That the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of ſuch as neglect the Salvation offered in the Goſpel will be <hi>Certain</hi> and Unavoidable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>USE I.</hi> THIS Truth may evidence the <hi>fearful blindneſs and ſottiſhneſs that many Sinners are under, who neglect the Salvation ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to them by Jeſus Chriſt in the Goſpel.</hi> It is evident from hence, becauſe there will be <hi>no poſſibility of eſcaping God's ſoreſt Wrath and Vengeance</hi> if this Salvation be neglected. This way of Salvation which the Goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds by Jeſus Chriſt is ſo ſuitable to the ſtate of fallen Man, ſo accommodated to
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:001939_0172_0FBA24A1A22E7148"/>
anſwer all his neceſſities; to relieve him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all his wants and fears; ſo ſafe a way, and a way wherein ſo much of the Grace, Love and Wiſdom of God hath appeared, that its own excellency and beneficialneſs may juſtly recommend it to all to whom the offer of it is made; but when, together with this, there is ſuch an unavoidable certainty of miſery unto all them that neglect it, one might juſtly expect that every Man ſhould be moſt deeply concern'd to ſecure an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in it, and uſe utmoſt diligence to make it his own. But alas! How much doth a contrary ſpirit appear! What careleſsneſs, ſlightneſs and indifferency do abundance manifeſt in this matter? As if it were a thing of little weight or worth, that they might do well enough in the neglect of. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> aſſigns the true reaſon hereof, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3, 4. Were not Men under fearful <hi>blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>ſtrong deluſions</hi> from the <hi>god of this World,</hi> it could not be that they ſhould thus neglect their own Mercies. This may be further manifeſted,</p>
               <p n="1">1. IN that <hi>they act ſo contrary to what they profeſs to be their Intereſt.</hi> It is a thing which Men generally, if not univerſally, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to be neceſſary to take care of the Salvation of their Souls, and provide for a future happineſs; that if Chriſt be not their
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:001939_0173_0FBA24A296B998B0"/>
Surety and Saviour, they are miſerable: that the life and ſafety of their Souls depends upon their Faith in Chriſt, and Repentance towards God, but yet they act as if they loved Death, and could be contented to venture Damnation. Tho' a Saviour be offered them, yet they neglect or defer clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with him. Were they not under a ſtrange infatuation blinded with the love of Sin, or the love of the World, it could not be that they ſhould leave their Souls at this hazard, and run ſuch a venture of periſhing for ever: eſpecially when they know their opportunities are continually paſſing from them, and they know not how ſoon God may put a period to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IN that this is the only way wherein there is any hopes of obtaining Salvation. If this way ben't cloſed with there is no hope of relief by any other. The Word of God aſſures us that as there is One God, ſo there is <hi>One Mediator between God and Men,</hi> and there is but <hi>One.</hi> Fooliſh Men have multiplied mediators as well as gods; but God never appointed but One. And it is thro' him alone that Salvation is attainable, Act. 4.12. <hi>Neither is there Salvation in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for there is no other name given among men whereby we muſt be ſaved.</hi> God never ſav'd any of the Children of Men upon any other
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:001939_0174_0FBA24A4239E9760"/>
account, and there's no room to expect he ever will. It muſt be owned that Heaven is the Lord's, and he may give it to whom he will; and upon what terms he will. But our Saviour tells us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.6. That he is <hi>the way the truth and life, that no man comes to the father but by him.</hi> You muſt take this way or periſh for ever. They who will not have Heaven upon Chriſt's terms muſt go with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. Now when the caſe is thus, it muſt be a moſt ſtrange infatuation and deluſion they are under who neglect it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. IN that <hi>God hath given as clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proofs of the certainty of this way of Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as can in reaſon be deſired, and of his wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to beſtow it upon the terms propounded in the Goſpel.</hi> So that they can't pretend a want of ſufficient Warrant for encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to believe. God in his Word plainly diſcovers to Men what their ſinful helpleſs and undone condition is; and how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble it is to them to get righteouſneſs and life by the Law. He hath alſo plainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſufficiency and acceptableneſs of the ſatisfaction that Chriſt hath made: that he is well pleaſed in him: that it was a way of his own contriving; that he <hi>ſanctified him, and ſent him into the World,</hi> Joh. 10.36. That <hi>the blood of Chriſt cleanſes from all ſin,</hi> Joh. 1.7. His Satisfaction was fully commenſurate to
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:001939_0175_0FBA24AC2FDA4650"/>
the demands of the Law and Juſtice of God. Believers have the ſure Word and <hi>Promiſe</hi> of God to depend upon in this matter, yea he hath confirmed it by his <hi>Oath,</hi> to this end (as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> aſſures in, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.17, 18.) That the <hi>Heirs of Promiſe might have ſtrong Conſolation.</hi> God formerly confirmed his Word by miraculous works, and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it by many ſupernatural effects: in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening, quieting and comforting the Conſciences of Sinners; filling them with <hi>Joy unſpeakable:</hi> and ſanctifying their hearts; which are a kind of Inchoation of Glory. Now after the truth of the Goſpel hath been ſo fully confirmed, and is ſo generally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged; for Men to be careleſs about the Salvation that it offers; doth ſurely flow from the blinding hardening power of ſin, and the deluſions impos'd upon them by the great Adverſary of their Souls.</p>

<pb n="167" facs="unknown:001939_0176_0FBA24AD07CF2540"/>
Lord Jeſus Chriſt, as the Goſpel requires: but ſpend their days in ſecurity, in carnal and ſenſual delights, in an eager proſecution of the profits of the World, or that in the pride of their hearts are ſeeking to eſtabliſh a righteouſneſs <hi>as it were by the works of the Law</hi>; and ſpend their days in ſinful diſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and vain and fruitleſs cavils againſt the duty of believing in Chriſt, which the Goſpel urges unto. I ſhall mention a few things here, to promote the Awakening and Conviction of ſuch Perſons.</p>
               <p>Conſider, 1. <hi>HOW great contempt of the Grace and Mercy and Condeſcention of God you are guilty of, by neglecting Chriſt and the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he offers to you.</hi> The offers of Salvation that are made to ſinners are fruits of free and undeſerved Grace. God had no need of Man's friendſhip or ſervice, had juſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage by the Law againſt him to have glorified himſelf in the executions of his Juſtice upon him: but notwithſtanding was pleas'd in ſovereign Mercy to provide and reveal a way of Salvation, wherein he would diſcover his own Perfections, and provide for the happineſs of Man. And as the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> here informs us, hath ſent <hi>His Own Son,</hi> to work out this Salvation for us, and to publiſh it to us. It is that which <hi>began to be
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:001939_0177_0FBA24AE87256050"/>
ſpoken to us by the Lord.</hi> The ever bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt was willing to come him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the boſom of his Father to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe and publiſh Salvation. Now the greatneſs of the Perſon ſent upon this great errand and deſign carries the greater obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in it to all to accept the offer, and heightens the ſin in the refuſal of it. God was juſtly offended with the <hi>Jews</hi> that they <hi>deſpiſed his Servants</hi>; and expected that ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would <hi>reverence his Son,</hi> when he ſent him among them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.57. The fuller and clearer the revelations of divine Grace are to Men, the greater aſſurance God gives of his readineſs to accept them, and beſtow Salvation in this way, there is the greater contempt in neglect and refuſal of it. The not hearkening to the <hi>Law of God delivered by Angels at Mount Sinai,</hi> was a contempt of God's Authority, and <hi>received a juſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of reward</hi>; As the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us in the <hi>Verſe</hi> before our <hi>Text.</hi> But it is a much greater contempt to diſobey the <hi>Goſpel</hi> which was <hi>Preached by Chriſt</hi> himſelf. In the one God is deſpiſed, ſpeaking by his Servants, in the other by his <hi>Son.</hi> There hath been a great deal of contempt caſt upon God by Sinners in all Ages, they under-value his goodneſs, ſlight his threatnings, trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his authority, walk contrary to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands:

It is an unreaſonable and injurious thing that they ſhould do ſo; but in this caſe the contempt riſes higher, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe not only his Authority is contemned which requires Men to obey the Goſpel, but his Grace and Love in the higheſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of them are ſlighted and undervalued, as though the rich offers that he makes, were not worthy of your ſerious regards, did not deſerve your thoughts, or the employing your time about. <hi>Do ye thus requite the Lord?</hi> Doth the bleſſed Jeſus deſerve no better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quital for all the Teſtimonies he hath given of his tender concern for you?</p>
               <p>Conſider, 2. <hi>THE inexpreſſible wrong you do to your own Souls.</hi> Nature teaches Men to love themſelves, to ſeek their own good, and eſpecially requires a due concern for the beſt part of themſelves, their Souls.

But they that neglect a Saviour diſregard and undervalue their own Souls, interpretatively <hi>they love Death.</hi> They bring the moſt certain and inexpreſſible miſery upon their own Souls. They cut themſelves off from any hope of acceptance with God,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:001939_0179_0FBA24B90A38D240"/>
and any title to a bleſſed Immortality, and bring upon themſelves certain and unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſery: yea at preſent they do un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable wrong to their own Souls, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving them of all true <hi>comfort.</hi> They can have no pardon of Sin, no peace with God, no hope in the Promiſes, no priviledge of acceſs to him. Theſe are all obtained by Chriſt, and communicated only for his ſake and upon his account to Believers; and they deprive them alſo of that which is their <hi>Beauty,</hi> their <hi>Honour,</hi> their <hi>Life</hi>; even that <hi>Holineſs</hi> and Sanctification which is a main part of the Salvation which Chriſt invites Sinners to come to him for. A Soul deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of holineſs is a loathſom vile thing in the Eyes of God. 'Tis fit to do him no ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to perform no acceptable duty, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert no act of Grace: is enſlaved to its own luſts; hurried by its irregular paſſions; a ready inſtrument of Satan to ſerve his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns; is often hurried as that miſerable <hi>Demoniack,</hi> Mark 5.5. <hi>To cut and wound and tear himſelf.</hi> Is pulling down many ſpiritual Judgments upon himſelf.

hearts, conveys and cheriſhes all ſpiritual life in them. Now can you be content to be an utter ſtranger to all true holineſs? To live under the tyranny of Satan, and reign of Sin? To have a Soul utterly unſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God while you live, and unfit and unworthy of any fellowſhip with God when you muſt die? Now thus it muſt be if the gracious offers that Chriſt makes be rejected and ſlighted. How unworthy the name of a <hi>Man</hi> is he that ſuffers a Soul to be thus neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected and ruined?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>YOU oppoſe, and as much as in you lies, fruſtrate one main deſign that God hath been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on from the beginning of the World.</hi> The work of <hi>Redemption</hi> is one of the great and moſt glorious Works of God which hath been upon his Heart before the foundations of the World; and whereby he deſigned to raiſe Eternal honour and glory to himſelf, and to bring about the greateſt good to his Elect. Now the means of effecting this, is by bringing Men to, <hi>Repentance and Faith</hi> in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; ſubmitting to the terms of the Goſpel. This is that which God calls Men to, when he brings his Goſpel to any place. The great duty he urges Men unto is not to receive the Grace of God in vain. Now it is in vain if his end be not
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:001939_0181_0FBA24BD51EFEB40"/>
attained; if Men neglect the duty enjoyned in order to God's Glory, and their own good. Now when Men act contrary to the end of God, it may be reaſonably concluded that it is very offenſive to him; as on the other hand it is pleaſing to him when his end is attained. Hence we read, that our Saviour <hi>rejoyced in Spirit,</hi> upon the report that the <hi>Diſciples</hi> brought him of the <hi>ſucceſs of their Miniſtry,</hi> Luk. 10.21. Now he enjoyed the end of his coming. We read, that <hi>there is joy in Heaven</hi> upon a Sinners Repentance, <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.7, 10. Heaven rings with joy at the report of it; that God is glorified, and a Soul reſcued from deſtruction; and it is matter of <hi>great joy and refreſhing</hi> to thoſe <hi>whom God ſends upon this Errand,</hi> to <hi>beſeech Men to be reconciled to God.</hi> When they ſee the glory of God advanc'd in the Salvation of Men, then they ſhall be able to give up their account with joy. And at another time you read, of Chriſt's being grieved <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the hardneſs of Mens hearts,</hi> Mar. 8.5. That they did not believe notwithſtanding the evident proofs that he gave of his Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. And at another time of his <hi>weeping over Jeruſalem, becauſe they underſtood not the things of their peace in the day of their viſitation.</hi> Now will you grieve and diſpleaſe the ever bleſſed God in croſſing him in an end ſo
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:001939_0182_0FBA24C40982FB78"/>
gracious and ſo glorious? Wherein your own welfare is enwrap'd ſo much with his honour? Will you rather chooſe to gratify your Luſts and pleaſe the Devil that would deſtroy you, then to pour out your Souls in earneſt cries that his Grace may be effectual in bringing your hearts to comply with the duty that the Goſpel requires of you? That God may be glorified and your Souls ſaved.</p>
               <p n="4">4. BY neglecting the Grace tendred to you in the Goſpel <hi>you are guilty of much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and oppoſition to the Spirit of God.</hi> The Diſpenſation of the Goſpel is called by the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> the <hi>Miniſtration of the Spirit,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8. Probably upon this account eſpecially, becauſe there is more of the Spirit goes along with it, then any before it, as he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo elſe-where intimates. There are very few, if any, who live to years of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but they are many times under the ſtrivings of the Spirit, awakening and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of them, cauſing of them to ſee their ſin and danger, exciting many terrors in their Conſciences, and putting them in mind of the neceſſity of Chriſt, of Faith, and of Repentance. Some improve and yield to theſe motions of the Spirit, and they are preparatory to their Eternal ſafety. But theſe that neglect the Salvation offered

them, refuſe and <hi>reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi> in his motions upon them; bear down the light they receive, ſuppreſs the convictions they have from the Spirit of God, and ſo become guilty of ſinning againſt more Grace and Love. Our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> intimates in the <hi>verſe</hi> after our <hi>Text,</hi> that this was one great ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation of Mens neglecting the Great Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that it was a Doctrine which had been atteſted to by divers <hi>extraordinary opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> And as theſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly left Men inexcuſable, ſo will the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſenſible operations of the Spirit upon Mens hearts, leave Men ſo now. They feel a divine power going along with the Word, whereby it ſenſibly touches their Conſciences, convinces of ſin, and in God's name condemns for it; urges to Repentance and Faith in Chriſt, in order to peace and pardon with God. So that they cannot but confeſs theſe things to be their duty. Now how tremendous a conſideration is this, that you ſhould he guilty of reſiſting the <hi>Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and withſtanding the methods of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace, to recover and ſave you? To ſlight the favour of God, to make a light ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Blood of Chriſt? To diſregard the Promiſes, and deſpiſe the Threatnings of the Goſpel, which riſe higher than any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and to reſiſt the ſpirit of God too in

its application of them: how inexcuſable will you be?</p>

                  <hi>USE III.</hi> OF <hi>Warning to all ſuch as have hitherto neglected the Great Salvation ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred in the Goſpel, no longer to perſiſt in your neglect of it.</hi> It is too long you have done ſo already; there's no juſt apology or plea that you can make for it; and you will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der your caſe the worſe by perſiſting in a thing ſo ſinful and unreaſonable. There are none of you but will cry out of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the blindneſs and obſtinacy of the <hi>Jews</hi> that had the firſt tender of Goſpel Grace, but neglected and refus'd it: and withſtood their own Mercies. Why then will you imitate their practice, continue care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of your own Souls, and provoke God to exclude you as he hath them? 'Tis your priviledge at preſent to enjoy the light of the Goſpel, with all clearneſs and liberty: the beſt Mercies are freely tendred to you. God juſtly expects that his offers be received thankfully, and a due entertainment given to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; that you don't prefer ſins and luſts before a Saviour: that you be not diverted by your Worldly inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and deſigns, from ſecuring Heavenly and Eternal mercies. It will be a thing of doleful conſequence if after ſuch opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and encouragements you fail of Eternal

Life. How ſtinging will be the reproaches of Conſcience for it? To enforce this matter,</p>
               <p>Conſi. 1. <hi>THE greatneſs of this ſin of Unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,</hi> in rejecting Chriſt and the Salvation that he offers. It is not without cauſe that God hath ſo often fixed <hi>Damnation</hi> to it, and ſo plainly threatned the ruine of thoſe that continue in it. Too often this ſin is look'd upon as a ſmall matter, as if it were their <hi>miſery</hi> rather than their <hi>ſin</hi> that it is <hi>not in their power to believe</hi> without the aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God. Yea ſome that ſtartle at other ſins, don't tremble at this; but this is a ſin that is very ſinful, and many ways aggravated in the ſight of God. This may appear in that this ſin flows from the wickedneſs of Men's hearts, as all other ſins do: it flows from the blindneſs of Men's minds, and the many unworthy thoughts of God that they are ready to entertain. They doubt of his Wiſdom, his Holineſs &amp; Truth. They are more ready to lay weight upon the word of a Man, than upon the Word of God. Unbelief reflects upon the Truth and Faithfulneſs of God. Hence it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.10. <hi>He that believeth not God hath made him a liar.</hi> How fearful a thing is it, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the God of truth, and One that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie? It diſparages and virtually denies

It is a ſin that is rooted in the pride, perverſeneſs and obſtinacy of Men<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s hearts. Hence Chriſt ſaith to them, Joh. 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye may have life.</hi> 'Tis a ſin that is committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt more Grace, Mercy and Love then many other ſins are. Hence it is ſaid to be in a peculiar manner the damning ſin, the ſin that binds the guilt of all other ſins upon the Soul, and cuts it off from the laſt and only remedy. It is a ſin of a very heinous and horrible nature; therefore juſtly to be dreaded and deprecated.</p>
               <p>Conſi. 2. <hi>WHAT Miſery this ſin of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the Great Salvation offered by Chriſt hath brought upon others.</hi> If we only look into the ſtate of the <hi>Jews,</hi> their example is very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive and awakening. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, Rom. 11.20. That <hi>for unbelief they were broken off.</hi> Their ſin was exceeding great in <hi>Crucifying the Prince of Life.</hi> But it pleaſed God to make them the offer of the Salvation that was purchaſed by that precious Blood
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:001939_0187_0FBA24D330F829D0"/>
afterward, and had they accepted the offer, it had been effectual to have expiated that crying ſin. But for their Unbelief God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected them. They were once a People <hi>highly favoured by God</hi>; there was no People in the World for many Generations ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly priviledg'd by God as they were, (as were eaſy to ſhew in many inſtances) But now as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells us, <hi>Wrath is come upon them to the uttermoſt,</hi> 1 Theſ. 2.16.

               <p>Conſi. 3. <hi>HOW uncapable you are to perform any act of duty to God, or to find acceptance with God in any ſervice you perform, 'till you are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in this Salvation by Faith in Chriſt, and a ſaving Converſion to God.</hi> It is only in the Name and upon the account of Chriſt that our Perſons and ſervices come to be of any account with God. Without Chriſt, <hi>God is a conſuming Fire,</hi> ready to conſume and deſtroy all the works and workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The <hi>Covenant of Works</hi> accepts of no obedience but that of a holy Perſon, and free from all imperfection. And you have no claim by the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> 'till the terms of it are conſented to. If therefore you are not united to Chriſt by Faith, have not the ſpirit of holineſs, enlivening of you, you can't plead acceptance in anything that you do. God takes no pleaſure in them, they will not be rewarded or crowned by God at laſt. Yea, if you are deſtitute of a principle of Faith and Love to God, they are all done for ſome corrupt end or other, are not a ſervice to God, but to ſome Luſt. Hence the very <hi>Praying</hi> as well as <hi>Plowing of the wicked is ſin.</hi> This duty now urg'd upon you is fundamental to all holy and gracious actions. Were this thing alone
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:001939_0189_0FBA24D5875A7240"/>
duly conſidered it might be enough to make you afraid of continuing any longer in the neglect of this Great Salvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>THINK how uncertain your opportunity of obtaining the Salvation that the Goſpel offers may be.</hi> God hath been a long time ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring the Bleſſings of the Goſpel to you; but he hath ſet bounds to his Patience how long it ſhall be exerciſed; not only towards Men in <hi>general,</hi> but towards <hi>particular Perſons.</hi> And you know not what bounds God hath ſet to it, when you ſhall come to the period of it. Perſons of all ranks and ages many times go <hi>ſuddenly</hi> down to the Grave. They who are ready to reckon upon many years, many times find ſuch a ſummons by Death as he did, Luk. 12.21. <hi>This night thy Soul ſhall be required of thee.</hi> It falls out with <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> as is threatned, 1 Theſ. 5.3. When <hi>they cry peace and ſafety ſudden deſtruction as travel upon a woman with child,</hi> ſeizes upon them. The getting out of a ſtate of Sin into a ſtate of Grace and Salvation is a work of great difficulty, and ordinarily will require time. Your own corruptions will riſe in oppoſition againſt it. <hi>Satan</hi> will do all he can to divert and diſcourage you. Therefore you can't be too earneſt or too ſpeedy about it; if this be neglected in the day of probation afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you, <hi>rivers of Tears</hi> throughout the ages of

Eternity will not do that for you which the <hi>Blood of Chriſt</hi> applied by Faith is able to do, even to atone the Wrath of a ſin-revenging God. Let the conſideration of theſe things prevail with you without any further delay to break off your ſins, however ſecret, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or profitable they have been. To cry mightily to God for the convincing, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and converting power of his Spirit, to accompany all Goſpel Diſpenſations and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances.

And it is the great duty of the People of God in a way of believing in Chriſt (who is the <hi>Mediator</hi> and Head of that Covenant) to look to God for the communication of them as their neceſſities do require. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.19. and 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30.

And you muſt honour Chriſt by <hi>believing the Promiſes</hi> he hath made of it. Such as theſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. <hi>Micah</hi> 7.19. <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.10. By <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the Means</hi> he hath appointed for it; the <hi>Word, Sacraments</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi> Enforcing the <hi>Precepts</hi> he hath given for it, and the rule of it, the encouragements he hath given to it, and by a daily recourſe to, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on him, in all your conflicts and temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; and for ſtrength and aſſiſtance in all duties and ſervices, under a ſenſe of your own nothingneſs. In this way Chriſt is wont to promote Holineſs, and cheriſh Grace in the hearts of his People, to make <hi>his power glorious in their weakneſs,</hi> to give them cauſe to ſay with the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, Exerciſe Faith in a dependance upon Chriſt <hi>for acceptance of your perſons and ſervices with God.</hi> Believers are wont to have mean and low thoughts of themſelves, and of the ſervices they do for God: And it is very fit they ſhould: Conſidering how mean and vile they are, and how much ſin is interwoven in their beſt ſervices.

all they do. But under the deepeſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of your own unworthineſs it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes you to entertain honourable thoughts of the worthineſs of Chriſt: to behold the Humane Nature exalted in him, to ſee God well pleaſed with him. And who tells us, Eph. 1.6. <hi>We are accepted in the beloved.</hi> To look to the fulneſs of his Satisfaction, the prevalency of his Interceſſion: Who as the great <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> hath entred into the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.20. Bears the <hi>Names</hi> of his People upon his <hi>Breaſt,</hi> preſents their Perſons and Services; atones for their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; perfumes them with his Merit. This will keep up your drooping ſpirits.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, Act Faith upon the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt <hi>with reſpect to your expectations of future Glory and Immortality,</hi> (in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof this Great Salvation will be compleated.) It is to be lamented that not only the greateſt part of thoſe that live in the common light of Chriſtianity, are blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and can't ſee afar off, are govern'd by ſenſe and appetite, and are craving only pleaſure, profit and honour, think not of the <hi>vaſt Eternity,</hi> to which they are haſtning; but even God's own People need to have a more clear and firm perſwaſion, and lively ſenſe of things to come; will venture little upon the hopes of them, are ſo little affected

with them, take ſo little pains for the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, and evidencing their title to them, and are much more ſwaved with the views of temporal advantages, then with the hopes of Eternal Mercies. This tends greatly to the diſhonour of Chriſt. But ſome there are to whom theſe things are real; who are <hi>looking for the bleſſed hope,</hi> Tit. 2.14. <hi>For a City that hath foundations,</hi> Heb. 11.10. Are contemplating the Glory of the Heavenly ſtate, the Rich Inheritance of the Saints. And while viewing the greatneſs of it, are ready with trembling hearts to ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend the Hill of the Lord, and ſtand in his Holy Place?</hi> It may ſupport your hearts in this caſe, to look <hi>by Faith</hi> upon it, as a <hi>Purchaſed Poſſeſſion,</hi> Eph. 1.14. Chriſt Jeſus hath laid down the price of Heaven for his People, fulfill'd the condition of Eternal Life in his perfect Obedience to the Law. That he hath carried our Nature into it, and taken poſſeſſion of it as a forerunner and ſurety for his People. And eſpecially may this quiet your hearts in the expectation of it, that Heaven itſelf, as great and as rich an Inheritance as it is, is not a greater Gift then Chriſt is: And if God had love enough to his People to <hi>give his Son,</hi> he don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

that ſpared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all, how ſhall he not with him freely give us all things?</hi> I only <hi>briefly</hi> touch theſe things. But it is not in theſe only, but in all <hi>Conditions of Life,</hi> in all <hi>Temptations</hi> and <hi>Trials,</hi> it is your <hi>duty,</hi> and will be your <hi>comfort</hi> to keep up the exerciſe of Faith on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BE Exhorted to a <hi>Life of Univerſal O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience and Holy Walking before God.</hi> The Apoſtle tells us, Heb. 5.9. <hi>He is become the Author of Eternal Salvation to all them that obey him.</hi> Chriſt came not into the World to countenance licentiouſneſs in his People; to leſſen Gods ſovereignty over us, or free us from our duty to him. He is a <hi>King and Lawgiver</hi> as well as <hi>Saviour</hi> to his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. 'Tis his aim to make them holy as well as happy. Indeed this ought deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be look'd upon as <hi>a main part of our hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> as well as the way leading to it. And there is no ſincere choice of Chriſt, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to him, where he is not received as a King as well as Saviour. It is an abuſe of the Grace of Chriſt manifeſted in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, when Perſons preſume upon inpunity, while they allow themſelves in ſin. Chriſt by <hi>ſuffering for ſin</hi> hath given us the cleareſt repreſentation of the evil nature of ſin, and its extream offenſiveneſs to God. By the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:001939_0199_0FBA2110CFD61F78"/>
of his Life he hath given us the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent <hi>pattern</hi> of Obedience: and by the purity of his Laws, hath given us the moſt perfect <hi>rule</hi> of Obedience. All which things clearly ſhew, it is what he expects from all his People. The honour of God, their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Relation to him, their hopes from him, and the experiences of his Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, there own comfort in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of the bleſſings he hath promiſed them, are all Motives to ſuch a Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The great duty of the Goſpel is <hi>Love.</hi> Now Love to Chriſt is eſpecially to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd by <hi>Obedience</hi>; as in that Precept of Chriſt, Joh. 14.15. <hi>If ye love me keep my Commandments.</hi> And that this is the moſt clear and genuine fruit of Love, Chriſt fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declares, in <hi>ver.</hi> 21.23, 4. Gods Love to us is a Love of <hi>beneficence,</hi> but our love to him is a love of <hi>reverence</hi> and <hi>obedience,</hi> a love to pleaſe and honour him. 1 Joh. 5.3. <hi>This is the love of God that we keep his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. And his Commandments are not grievous.</hi> Now if you ask what Obedience is required, this may be beſt anſwered by a reference to ſome comprehenſive <hi>Places of Scripture,</hi> where you may find it in <hi>God's Name,</hi> expreſly enjoyned. As, 1 Pet. 1.15. <hi>But at he which hath called you is holy, ſo be ye holy in all manner of Converſation.</hi> Here God

himſelf is propos'd as a Pattern; which ſhews that the higheſt meaſures of holineſs, ſhould be the aims of Chriſtians: they ſhould make it their deſign to reſemble the God they Worſhip. This is an honour put upon God, when his People are witneſſes to his holineſs; when they teſtify to the holineſs of God, in his Nature and Laws, by the holineſs of their walk. God being perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly holy both in reſpect of the purity of his Eſſence, and the rectitude of his Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, ſhews that Chriſtians ſhould be <hi>holy</hi> in the <hi>ſtate and temper of their Souls,</hi> and in the <hi>courſe of their actions</hi>; and it is added, in <hi>all manner of Converſation.</hi> The whole of his Converſation ought to ſavour of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: not only his <hi>Religious</hi> but his <hi>Civil Actions</hi> ought to be done <hi>in the Lord,</hi> and for his Glory. In every condition of Life, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs ſhould appear. When <hi>ſurrounded with Bleſſings</hi> his heart ſhould be filled with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Praiſes to God; and he ſhould be ready to <hi>ſerve him with joyfulneſs and gladneſs of heart in the abundance of all things that he enjoys.</hi> Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Afflictions</hi> he ſhould be holy, be bringing forth fruits of repentance, meekneſs, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and a due reſignation to the divine Will And in every <hi>Relation,</hi> as <hi>Husbands</hi> and <hi>Wives, Parents, Maſters, Children</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,</hi> the holineſs of Chriſtians ſhould ſhine

forth in a conſcientious obſervation of all ſuch rules as concern their <hi>Relative Duties</hi>; towards their Families or Neighbours. Such render their holineſs queſtionable that don't ſhew it in their <hi>Relations.</hi> This is the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ſphere of their activity: therefore here they have moſt frequent occaſions to expreſs it. And a courſe of holineſs in all Relative duties will have an extenſive influence upon others, who ſhall be the better for it, and will hopefully be ready to imitate it, or at leaſt be awed by it. Indeed if Piety ben't carefully maintained in <hi>Families</hi> it will lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh every where elſe.</p>
               <p>AGAIN, You have another Precept in, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74, 75. where our duty is made the end of our deliverance. Chriſt came not to exempt us from the ſervice of God, but that we might ſerve him the more cheerfully, without <hi>ſervile fear,</hi> and with cheerfulneſs and joy of heart. And the branches of duty here urged are <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi> the former may reſpect the duties nextly due to God, and enjoyned in the <hi>Firſt Table</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> a holy fear of, faith in, and love to God as our higheſt good, our portion and bleſſedneſs; a conſcientious regard of his <hi>Worſhip</hi> in all the branches of it, and the <hi>manner</hi> of attending it: A reverence of his <hi>Name,</hi> both in our thoughts and expreſſions.
