            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Is that it on thy Head? it's very Dark; </l>
               <l>It hardly will be own'd at the last Day,</l>
               <l>But JESUS CHRIST unto all such will say,</l>
               <l>Away be gone, be gone away from me,</l>
               <l>I am displeas'd <hi>both</hi> with thy Garb <hi>and</hi> Thee.</l>

               <l>LORD, pluck such Brands as these out of the Fire,</l>
               <l>So we thy Rich Grace shall the more Admire,</l>

Pride by the name of Decency we call,</l>
               <l>Although to <hi>Adam</hi> it gave such a fall;</l>
               <l>Which hath benumm'd our Senses, so that we</l>
               <l>Remain stark Blind, till GOD doth make us see:</l>

               <l>Then may we Pray, have Mercy LORD on us,</l>
               <l>That in <hi>New-England</hi> it should now be thus,</l>
               <l>Which in time past a Land of Pray'r hath been,</l>
               <l>But now is Pray'r turn'd out of Doors by Sin:</l>
               <l>For <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> can't together dwell,</l>
               <l>

               </l>
               <l>Of some vile Wretch, by foul Disease that fell,</l>
               <l>Whose Soul perhaps is burning now in Hell?</l>
               <l>O therefore I do you most humbly pray,</l>
               <l>Your monstrous <hi>Perriwigs</hi> cast quite away:</l>
               <l>If JESUS CHRIST unto your Souls were sweet,</l>
               <l>Those <hi>Toys on</hi> Head you'd trample under Feet,</l>
               <l>And say to them with indignation,</l>
               <l>As <hi>Ephraim</hi> to his Idols, be you gone;</l>
               <l>We never will have more to do with you,</l>
               <l>Lest GOD in's wrath out of his Land us spue.</l>

               <l>A TENDER Conscience a great Blessing is,</l>
               <l>Sure willingly such will not do amiss;</l>
               <l>But carefully will watch against all Sin,</l>
               <l>In <hi>outward</hi> Man as well as Heart within:</l>
               <l>Abstaining all appearances of Evil,</l>
               <l>Lest they therein resemble should the Devil.</l>
               <l>Many there are that say they do believe,</l>
               <l>But they therein do but themselves deceive;</l>
               <l>For Faith that's true will purifie the Heart,</l>
               <l>And from the most beloved Sin will part.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>WHAT Mercy is't, that GOD will chide and strike</l>

               <l>The foolish World, who Lust and Pride do mind,</l>
               <l>Reward thereof they in the end will find</l>
               <l>Bitter to be, if on they yet do go,</l>
               <l>Because Sin leads to final overthrow.</l>
               <l>Then help us LORD to mend our way, that we</l>
               <l>In Heart and Life may wholly turn to Thee;</l>
               <l>And cast away our <hi>Foolish</hi> Fancies all,</l>
               <l>Lest GOD in wrath take <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Crown</hi> and all.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>I AM amazed much to think how we,</l>
               <l>Are backward gone from GOD, and cannot see</l>
               <l>Who'ere allow themselves in <hi>one</hi> known Sin,</l>
               <l>Satan hath got such safely in his Gin:</l>
