            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="4" facs="unknown:006140_0003_0000000000000000"/>
And as Party, Interest, the insatiable Love of Money, are ever the most violent Enemies to Truth, Liberty, and the universal Love of one's Country; so wherever these are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant and daily grow more powerful, they do forever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to the utmost of their Skill and Strength, right or wrong, to warp and bend every Thing, however unjust, unsociable and selfish, to say in, fix and strengthen <hi>that Side, or Party they are of,</hi> however opposite, detrimental, and pernicious it may prove in its Consequences, to the whole Community, to their Country, either row, or hereafter: And the greater and more powerful the Party, and the greater the <hi>Interest</hi> to uphold and carry it on, consequently the greater must be the real <hi>Damage</hi> done to all those against <hi>whom</hi> any such S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tt and Party of Men improve their Interest, and exert their Power.</p>
            <p>Now, if these general <hi>Observations</hi> are true; it will we believe be readily granted that there is a great Deal of Reason, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very honest Man, at this critical Conjuncture of our Affairs of this Province, when Things are, we fear, <hi>ripening for our final Destruction and Overthrow,</hi> to stand up unterrified and unseduced, for the <hi>real Interest,</hi> Liberties and Properties of his Fellow-Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, and for his dear Children, and his dearer Country. Now every honest Man has a fair Opportunity to prove to the World, whether he most <hi>loveth his Country,</hi> or the <hi>Mammon;</hi> whether he is a <hi>true Patron,</hi> or a <hi>Demas,</hi> or a <hi>Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Experience has dearly and wofully taught us all, That <hi>nothing in the World will so powerfully set the Tongue, the Pen, the Wit, and Heart of most Men so earnestly, so vigorously to Work as IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TEREST, either real or imaginary.</hi> This it was perhaps that sat the judicious Author to work to write and publish to the World that Piece in a late <hi>Independent Advertiser,</hi> No. 13. Mar. 28. wherein the good Author out of pure Zeal for Virtue and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Love to his Country, has dictated and prescribed the <hi>only Scheme</hi> (as he says) that can possibly have any direct and good Tendency to implant in us the moral Duties and Virtues; and really make us, a wise, pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="5" facs="unknown:006140_0004_0000000000000000"/>
upon the due Appropriation of the late Royal Bounty graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously granted to the brave Sons of <hi>New-England,</hi> for the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Atchievement in the happy Reduction of the mighty Fortress at <hi>Louisbourg.</hi> Which Bounty cannot consistent with true Wisdom be any Way so well, and wisely managed and disposed of by the Governments for the real and perpetual Good, Welfare and Prosperity of the Publick, As <hi>"Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to deliver it all up in a Lump to the good M—and redeem of them, all the great Emission of Paper-Money,</hi> which they are <hi>now collecting together.</hi> This (says that pious Scribble) will make us, more rich, more wise, frugal, industrious, more in Love of Virtue, and averse to Vice, Vanity and Folly—</q>
               <hi>Glorious Scheme</hi>—Taking it (<hi>as he does</hi>) for granted, that the very large Emission of our Paper-Currency, only, has absolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved and overwhelmed us in all our prodigious Difficulties and Misfortunes—Surely this Gentleman could see a vast Way, and penetrate into the inmost Recesses of the political CONSTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUTION.—But what if any one should have the Front and Hardiness to say, that it is not so in Fact, but far otherwise; and that our Difficulties are compounded of many hurtful Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, and that they have been a long Time coming upon us; and that we have but just now as it were been favoured with a <hi>Medicine</hi> that has reached the Cause.—'Tis universally allow'd that Peace, Industry, and good Government, make most Things <hi>plenty,</hi> and consequently <hi>cheap:</hi> That <hi>War,</hi> is a great Calamity, or rather the greatest of Calamities, and always brings on Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, Devastation and Distress of every Kind: That it is the PEOPLE which are the true Riches, Beauty, and Strength of every Kingdom, Nation and Province; and when <hi>the People are taken away,</hi> and the Country thereby thin'd and made bare of <hi>Labourers</hi> and Inhabitants; <hi>then also,</hi> almost <hi>every Blessing is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away with them; and if this had not been,</hi> and were it not <hi>now</hi> very much <hi>our Case</hi> with Regard <hi>to the People,</hi> we should not <hi>even now (with all our Paper Money, as bad as it is)</hi> be in such sinking, such deplorable Circumstances.—Does the Ground manure and till it self? And will the Earth yield her Increase without the Labour of the Husbandman? What Benefit in many

Respects is the shining of the Sun, and the most refreshing Rains and Dews upon the Earth, where few or no People are? Are not <hi>Things many Times very scarce, and very dear,</hi> even where SILVER MONEY <hi>it self,</hi> is very plenty!—And are Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of Life, &amp;c.—ever <hi>any where cheap and plenty</hi> (especially in War-Time) but where there is constantly <hi>much People?</hi>—Take away the <hi>Bees,</hi> and although your Garden may for a Time be ever so beautifully stored and adorned with the greatest Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Flowers, yet you shall have no <hi>Honey</hi> in the Hive, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you would <hi>give ever so dear</hi> for it; but there always <hi>will be Honey where there are Bees;</hi> and always the more Honey the better they are looked after.</p>
            <p>If this will hold good with Regard to the <hi>Political Hive,</hi> see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this is pretty much <hi>our</hi> impoverished Case, who are now so drained of our robust and able-bodied Labourers, the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence must be, that <hi>all our Difficulties don't necessarily arise meerly on Account of the great Emission of Paper Money.</hi> And in Case the <hi>Paper Money had not been made,</hi> by the publick Currency of which, we carried on the great Expedition against our potent and common Enemies, and happily (through divine Goodness) succeeded, we perhaps should have been in much <hi>worse Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And, notwithstanding the mighty Bustle and Clamour, that has been by some cunning and selfish Men industriously raised and aggravated, about <hi>the Badness of the Money,</hi> yet we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perimentally taught <hi>to know,</hi> that if the <hi>Articles of Life</hi> had been, or were now <hi>very plenty,</hi> they must, and would be <hi>cheap;</hi> and be sold very low <hi>even</hi> for our despised <hi>Paper-Money!</hi> This is also true with Regard to the Money itself, which even the M—themselves every Day are fully demonstrating to every one that hath Eyes to see, and Ears to hear; or else why are they so greedy after it, hoarding of it up to make it scarce, in Order to <hi>make it to them as good as so much SILVER.</hi> First they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn'd it, and <hi>them that</hi> made it, and jumpt a 100 <hi>per cent</hi> in the <hi>Principal,</hi> for every Article they parted with for it; altho' they were for the <hi>Expedition it self;</hi> then settled their Books and Accounts, fixt them at <hi>Silver</hi> from 26 <hi>s.</hi> 8. <hi>d.</hi> to about 30 <hi>s.</hi> per
