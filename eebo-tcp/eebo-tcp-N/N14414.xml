            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE great object, for which I had the honor to hold an appointment in the service of my country, being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, I am now preparing to resign it into the hands of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, and to return to that domestic retirement, which, it is well known, I left with the greatest reluctance;—a retirement, for which I have never ceased to sigh, through a long and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful absence,—and in which, remote from the noise and trouble of the world, I meditate to pass the remainder of life, in a state of undisturbed repose.—</p>
            <p>But before I carry this resolution into effect, I think it a du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty incumbent upon me to make this my last official communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,—to congratulate you on the glorious events, which Heaven has been pleased to produce in our favor,—to offer my sentiments respecting some important subjects which appear to me to be intimately connected with the tranquility of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States,—to take my leave of your Excellency as a public character, and to give my final blessing to that country in whose service I have spent the prime of my life—for whose sake I have consumed so many anxious days and watchful nights, and whose happiness being extremely dear to me, will always constitute no inconsiderable part of my own.—</p>
            <p>Impressed with the liveliest sensibility on this pleasing occasion, I will claim the indulgence of dilating the more copiously on the subjects of our mutual felicitation;—
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018259_0004_0FA5BDD04FB1DA50"/>
When we consider the magnitude of the prize we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for, the doubtful nature of the contest, and the favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able manner in which it has terminated; we shall find the greatest possible reason for gratitude and rejoicing;—this is a theme that will afford infinite delight to every benevolent and liberal mind, whether the event in contemplation, be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the source of present enjoyment, or the parent of future happiness,—and we shall have equal occasion to felicitate our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves on the lot which Providence has assigned us, whether we view it in a natural, a political or moral point of light.</p>
            <p>The citizens of America, placed in the most enviable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the sole Lords and Proprietors of a vast tract of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, comprehending all the various soils and climates of the world, and abounding with all the necessaries and conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of life, are now, by the late satisfactory pacification, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to be possessed of absolute freedom and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency;—They are from this period, to be considered as the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors on a most conspicuous theatre, which seems to be peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly designated by Providence, for the display of human great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and felicity.—Here, they are not only surrounded with every thing which can contribute to the completion of private and domestic enjoyment; but Heaven has crowned all its other blessings, by giving a fairer opportunity for political happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, than any other nation has ever been favored with.—Nothing can illustrate these observations more forcibly, than a recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the happy conjuncture of times and circumstances, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der which our republic assumed its rank among the nations. The foundation of our empire was not laid in the gloomy age of ignorance and superstition, but at an epocha when the rights of mankind were better understood and more clearly defined, than at any former period;—the researches of the human mind, after social happiness, have been carried to a great extent,—the treasures of knowledge, acquired by the labors of philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, sages and legislators, through a long succession of years, are laid open for our use, and their collected wisdom may be happily applied in the establishment of our forms of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.—The free cultivation of letters, the unbounded extension of commerce, the progressive refinement of manners, the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liberality of sentiment, and above all, the pure and benign light of revelation, have had a meliorating influence on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and increased the blessings of society;—at this auspicious period, the United States came into existence as a nation, and
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018259_0005_0FA5BDD09C1C4A00"/>
if their citizens should not be completely free and happy, the fault will be entirely their own.</p>
            <p>Such is our situation, and such are our prospects;—but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding the cup of blessing is thus reached out to us,—notwithstanding happiness is ours, if we have a disposition to seize the occasion and make it our own, yet, it appears to me, there is an option still left to the United States of America, that it is in their choice and depends upon their conduct, whether they will be respectable and prosperous, or contemptible and miserable as a nation;—this is the time of their political pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,—this is the moment when the eyes of the whole world are turned upon them—this is the moment to establish or ruin their national character for ever,—this is the favourable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to give such a tone to our foederal government, as will enable it to answer the ends of its institution,—or this may be the ill-fated moment for relaxing the powers of the union, anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilating the cement of the confederation, and exposing us to become the sport of European politics, which may play one state against another to prevent their growing importance, and to serve their own interested purposes: For according to the system of policy the States shall adopt at this moment, they will stand or fall; and by their confirmation or lapse, it is yet to be decided, whether the revolution must ultimately be considered as a blessing or a curse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—a blessing or a curse, not to the present age alone, for with our fate will the destiny of unborn millions be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved.</p>
            <p>With this conviction in my mind, of the importance of the present crisis, silence in me would be a crime,—I will therefore speak to your Excellency, the language of freedom and of since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity without disguise;—I am aware however that those who differ from me in political sentiment may perhaps remark, I am stepping out of the proper line of my duty, and they may pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly ascribe to arrogance or oftentation, what I know is alone the result of the purest intention—but the rectitude of my own heart, which disdains such unworthy motives, the part I have hitherto acted in life, the determination I have formed, of not taking any share in public business hereafter, the ardent desire I feel, and shall continue to manifest of quietly enjoying in private life, after all the toils of war, the benefits of a wise and liberal government, will, I flatter myself sooner or later, convince my countrymen, that I could have no sinister views in delivering with so little reserve the opinions contained in this address.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:018259_0006_0FA5BDD2691A0C88"/>
There are four things, which I humbly conceive, are essential to the well being, I may even venture to say, to the existence of the United States as an Independent Power.</p>
            <p>1st, An indissoluble union of the States under one foederal head.</p>
            <p>2dly, A sacred regard to public justice.</p>
            <p>3dly. The adoption of a proper peace establishment. And,</p>
            <p>4thly, The prevalence of that pacific and friendly disposition among the people of the United States, which will induce them to forget their local prejudices and policies, to make those mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual concessions which are requisite to the general prosperity, and in some instances, to sacrifice their individual advantages to the interest of the community.</p>
            <p>These are the pillars, on which the glorious fabrick of our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency and national character, must be supported,—Liberty is the basis,—and whoever would dare to sap the foundation, or overturn the structure, under whatever specious pretexs he may attempt it, will merit the bitterest execration, and the severest punishment which can be inflicted by his injured country.</p>
            <p>On the three first articles, I will make a few observations,—leaving the last to the good sense and serious consideration of those immediately concerned.</p>
            <p>Under the first head, although it may not be necessary or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for me in this place, to enter into a particular disquisition of the principles of the union, and to take up the great question, which has been frequently agitated, whether it be expedient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite for the States to delegate a larger proportion of power to Congress, or not,—yet it will be a part of my duty, and that of every true patriot, to assert without reserve, and to insist upon the following positions:—That unless the States will suffer Congress to exercise those prerogatives, they are undoubtedly invested with by the constitution, every thing must very rapidly tend to anarchy and confusion—That it is indispensable to the happiness of the individual States that there should be lodged somewhere, a supreme power, to regulate and govern the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral concerns of the Confederated Republic, without which the union cannot be of long duration—That there must be a faithful and pointed compliance, on the part of every State, with the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018259_0007_0FA5BDD46BBD72E0"/>
late proposals and demands of Congress, or the most fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences will ensue—That whatever measures have a tendency to dissolve the union, or contribute to violate or lessen the sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign authority, ought to be considered as hostile to the liberty and independency of America, and the authors of them treated accordingly—And lastly, That unless we can be enabled, by the concurrence of the States, to participate of the fruits of the revolution, and enjoy the essential benefits of civil society un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a form of government so free and uncorrupted, so happily guarded, against the danger of oppression, as has been devised and adopted by the articles of confederation,—that it will be a subject of regret, that so much blood and treasure have been la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished for no purpose, that so many sufferings have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered, without a compensation, and that so many sacrifices have been made in vain. Many other considerations might here be adduced to prove, that without an entire conformity to the spirit of the union, we cannot exist as an Independent Power,—it will be sufficient for my present purpose to mention, but one or two, which seem to me of the greatest importance: It is only in our united character as an empire, that our indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is acknowledged, that our power can be regarded, or our credit supported among foreign nations—The treaties of the European powers with the United States of America, will have no validity on a dissolution of the union.—We shall be left near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a state of nature, or we may find by our own unhappy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that there is a natural and necessary progression from the extreme of anarchy to the extreme of tyranny; and that arbitrary power is most easily established on the ruins of liberty abused to licentiousness.</p>
            <p>As to the second article, which respects the performance of public justice, Congress have in their late address to the United States, almost exhausted the subject,—they have explained their ideas so fully, and have enforced the obligations the States are under to render compleat justice to all the public creditors, with so much dignity and energy, that in my opinion, no real friend to the honor and independency of America, can hesitate a single moment respecting the propriety of complying with the just and honorable measures proposed; if their arguments do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce conviction, I know of nothing that will have greater in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence; especially when we recollect that the system referred to, being the result of the collected wisdom of the continent, must be esteemed, if not perfect, certainly the least objectiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any that could be devised; and that if it shall not be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018259_0008_0FA5BDD4E6FB7E00"/>
into immediate execution, a national bankruptcy, with all its deplorable consequences will take place, before any different plan can possibly be proposed and adopted—So pressing are the present circumstances! and such is the alternative now offered to the States!</p>
            <p>The ability of the country to discharge the debts which have been incurred in its defence is not to be doubted—An inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I flatter myself will not be wanting—The path of our duty is plain before us.—Honesty, will be found on every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, to be the best and only true policy.—Let us then, as a nation, be just—Let us fulfil the public contracts, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress had undoubtedly a right to make for the purpose of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the war, with the same good faith, we suppose ourselves bound to perform our private engagements—In the mean time, let an attention to the chearful performance of their proper bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness as individuals, and as members of society, be earnestly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated on the citizens of America; then will they strengthen the hands of government, and be happy under its protection—every one will reap the fruit of his labours—every one will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy his own acquisitions, without molestation and without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
            <p>In this state of absolute freedom, and perfect security, who will grudge to yield a very little of his property to support the common interest of society, and ensure the protection of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? Who does not remember, the frequent declarations at the commencement of the war, that we should be compleatly satisfied, if at the expence of one half, we could defend the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of our possessions? Where is the man to be found who wishes to remain indebted, for the defence of his own person and property, to the exertions, the bravery, and the blood of others, without making one generous effort to repay the debt of honor and of gratitude? In what part of the continent shall we find any man or body of men, who would not blush to stand up and propose measures, purposely calculated to rob the soldier of his stipend, and the public creditor of his due? And were it possible that such a flagrant instance of injustice could ever happen, would it not excite the general indignation, and tend to bring down, upon the authors of such measures, the aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vengeance of heaven?</p>
            <p>If after all, a spirit of disunion or a temper of obstinacy and perverseness, should manifest itself in any of the States, if such an ungracious disposition should attempt to frustrate all the

happy effects that might be expected to flow from the union,—if there should be a refusal to comply with the requisitions for funds to discharge the annual interest of the public debts, and if that refusal should revive again all those jealousies, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce all those evils which are now happily removed, Congress, who have in all their transactions shewn a great degree of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity and justice, will stand justified in the sight of God, and man, and the state alone which puts itself in opposition, to the aggregate wisdom of the continent, and follows such mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and pernicious councils, will be responsible for all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences.</p>
            <p>For my own part, conscious of having acted while a servant of the public, in the manner I conceived best suited to promote the real interests of my country; having in consequence of my fixed belief, in some measure pledged myself to the army, that their country would finally do them compleat and ample justice; and not wishing to conceal any instance of my official conduct from the eyes of the world, I have thought proper to transmit to your Excellency the enclosed collection of papers, relative to the half-pay and commutation granted by Congress to the officers of the army—From these communications my decided senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be clearly comprehended, together with the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive reasons which induced me, at an early period, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the adoption of this measure in the most earnest and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious manner.</p>
            <p>As the proceedings of congress, the army and myself, are open to all, and contain in my opinion, sufficient information to remove the prejudices and errors which may have been enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by any, I think it unnecessary to say any thing more than just to observe, that the resolutions of Congress now alluded to, are undoubtedly as absolutely binding upon the United States, as the most solemn acts of confederation or legislation.</p>
            <p>As to the idea, which I am informed has in some instances prevailed, that the half-pay and commutation are to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed merely in the odious light of a pension, it ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploded forever;—that provision, should be viewed as it really was, a reasonable compensation offered by Congress, at a time when they had nothing else to give, to the officers of the army for services then to be performed—it was the only means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a total derelection of the service.—it was a part of their hire—I may be allowed to say, it was the price of their blood and of your independency: it is therefore more than a common
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018259_0010_0FA5BDD667162E08"/>
debt—it is a debt of honor,—it can never be considered as a pension or gratuity, nor be cancelled until it is fairly discharged.</p>
            <p>With regard to a distinction between officers and soldiers, it is sufficient that the uniform experience of every nation of the world, combined with our own, proves the utility and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of the discrimination—Rewards in proportion to the aids the public derives from them, are unquestionably due to all its servants; in some lines, the soldiers have perhaps generally had an ample compensation for their services, by their large bounties which have been paid them, as their officers will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in the proposed commutation; in others, if besides the donation of lands, the payment of arrearages of cloathing and wages (in which articles all the component parts of the army must be put upon the same footing) we take into the estimate, the bounties many of the soldiers have received and the gratui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one years full pay, which is promised to all, possibly their situation (every circumstance being duly considered) will not be deemed less eligible than that of their officers;—should a further reward, however, be judged equitable, I will venture to assert, no one will enjoy greater satisfaction than myself, on see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, an exemption from taxes for a limited time (which has been petitioned for in some instances) or any other adequate immunity, or compensation, granted to the brave desenders of their country's cause; but neither the adoption or rejection of this proposition will in any manner effect, much less militate against, the act of Congress, by which they have offered five years full pay in lieu of the half-pay for life, which had been before promised to the officers of the army.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude the subject of public justice, I cannot omit to mention the obligations this country is under to that merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious class of veteran non-commissioned officers and privates, who have been discharged for inability in consequence of the resolution of Congress of the 23d of April 1782, on an annual pension for life,—their peculiar sufferings, their singular merits and claims to that provision, need only be known, to interest all the feelings of humanity in their behalf—nothing but a punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual payment of their annual allowance can rescue them from the most complicated misery, and nothing could be a more me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and distressing sight, than to behold those who have shed their blood, or lost their limbs in the service of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without a shelter, without a friend, and without the means of obtaining any of the necessaries or comforts of life, compelled to beg their daily bread from door to door—Suffer me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018259_0011_0FA5BDD760BCCC60"/>
those of this description, belonging to your State, to the warmest patronage of your Excellency and your legislature.</p>
            <p>It is necessary to say but a few words on the third topic which was proposed, and which regards particularly the defence of the republic. As there can be little doubt but Congress will recommend a proper peace establishment for the United States, in which a due attention will be paid to the importance of pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the militia of the Union upon a regular and respectable footing; if this should be the case, I would beg leave to urge the great advantage of it in the strongest terms.—The militia of this country must be considered as the palladium of our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and the first effectual resort in case of hostility;—it is essential therefore, that the same system should pervade the whole—that the formation and discipline of the militia of the Continent, should be absolutely uniform, and that the same spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of arms, accoutrements, and military apparatus, should be introduced in every part of the United States;—No one who has not learned it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, expence and confusion, which result from a contrary system, or the vague arrangements which have hitherto prevailed.</p>
            <p>If in treating of political points, a greater latitude than usual has been taken in the course of this address—the importance of the crisis, and the magnitude of the objects in discussion, must be my apology;—it is however, neither my wish or expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the preceding observations, should claim any regard, except so far as they shall appear to be dictated by a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, consonant to the immutable rules of justice, calculated to produce a liberal system of policy, and founded on whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience may have been acquired, by a long and close attention to public business;—here I might speak with the more confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from my actual observations, and, if it would not swell this letter (already too prolix) beyond the bounds I had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed myself, I could demonstate, to every mind open to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, that in less time and with much less expence than has been incurred, the war might have been brought to the same happy conclusion, if the resources of the Continent could have been properly brought forth,—that the distresses and disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have very often occurred, have in too many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, resulted more from a want of energy in the Continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal government, than a deficiency of means in the particular States;—that the inefficacy of measures, arising from the want of an adequate authority in the supreme power, from a partial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the requisitions of Congress in some of the States, and from a failure of punctuality in others, while it tended to damp
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018259_0012_0FA5BDD7F669DEE0"/>
the zeal of those which were more willing to exert themselves, served also to accumulate the expences of the war, and to frus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the best concerted plans,—md that the discouragement oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casioned by the complicated difficulties and embarrasments, in which our affairs were by this means involved, would have long ago produced the dissolution of any army, less patient, less virtuous and less persevering, than that which I have had the honor to command; But while I mention these things, which are notorious facts, as the defects of our foederal constitution, particularly in the prosecution of a war,—I beg it may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, that as I have ever taken a pleasure in gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the assistance and support I have derived, from every class of citizens, so shall I always be happy to do justice to the unparalled exertions of the individual States, on many interesting occasions.</p>
            <p>I have thus freely disclosed what I wished to make known, before I surrendered up my public trust to those who commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to me.—The task is now accomplished.—I now bid adieu to your Excellency as the chief magistrate of your State,—at the same time I bid a last farewell to the cares of office, and all the employments of public life.</p>
            <p>It remains then to be my final and only request that your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency will communicate these sentiments to your Legislature at their next meeting, and that they may be considered as the legacy of one, who has ardently wished on all occasions, to be useful to his country, and who, even in the shade of retirement, will not fail to implore the divine benediction upon it.</p>
            <p>I now make it my earnest prayer, that God would have you, and the State over which you preside, in his holy protection,—that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government,—to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low citizens of the United States, and particularly for their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who have served in the field—and finally, that he would most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility and pacific temper of mind, which were the characteristics of the divine author of our blessed religion, and without an humble imitation of whose example in these things, we can never hope to be a happy nation.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>THE numerous defects in our present military establishment, rendering many reformations and many new arrangements absolutely necessary, and Congress having been pleased to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point you a Committee, in concert with me, to make and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend such as shall appear eligible, in pursuance of the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious objects expressed in their resolution for that purpose.—I have in the following sheets, briefly delivered my sentiments upon such of them, as seemed to me most essential, so far, as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation has suggested, and leisure permitted.—These are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to consideration, and I shall be happy if they are found conducive to remedying the evils and inconveniencies we are now subject to, and putting the army upon a more respectable footing. Something must be done,—important alterations must be made,—necessity requires that our resources should be enlarged and our system improved; for without it, if the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the army should not be the consequence, at least its operations must infallibly be feeble, languid and ineffectual.</p>
               <p>As I consider a proper and satisfactory provision for officers, in a manner, as the basis of every other regulation and arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment necessary to be made; since without officers no army can exist, and unless some measures be devised to place those of ours in a more desireable situation, few of them would be able, if willing, to continue in it.—I shall begin with a few reflections, tending to prove the necessity
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018259_0014_0FA5BDD980595718"/>
OF A HALF-PAY ESTABLISHMENT.</p>
               <p>A small knowledge of human nature will convince us, that with far the greatest part of mankind, interest is the governing prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple; and that, almost, every man is more or less under its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence. Motives of public virtue may for a time, or in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular instances, actuate men to the observance of a conduct purely disinterested; but they are not of themselves sufficient to produce a persevering conformity to the refined dictates and obligations of social duty.</p>
               <p>Few men are capable of making a continual sacrifice of all views of private interest, or advantage, to common good.—It is in vain to exclaim against the depravity of human nature on this account—the fact is so, the experience of every age and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has proved it; and we must, in a great measure, change the constitution of man, before we can make it otherwise. No institution, not built on the presumptive truth of these maxims, can succeed.</p>
               <p>We find them exemplified in the American officers, as well as in all other men. At the commencement of the dispute,—in the first effusions of their zeal, and looking upon the service to be only temporary, they entered into it, without paying any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to pecuniary or selfish considerations. But finding its du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to be much longer than they at first suspected, and that instead of deriving any advantage from the hardships and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to which they were exposed, they on the contrary, were losers by their patriotism, and fell far short even of a competen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to supply their wants, they have gradually abated in their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor; and with many, an entire disinclination to the service, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its present circumstances, has taken place. To this, in an eminent degree, must be ascribed the frequent resignations dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happening, and the more frequent importunities for permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to resign, and from some officers of the greatest merit. To this also may we ascribe the apathy, inattention and neglect of duty, which pervade all ranks, and which will necessarily conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and increase, while an officer, instead of gaining any thing, is impoverished by his commission; and conceives he is confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, not receiving, a favor in holding it. There can be no suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient tie upon men possessing such sentiments. Nor can any method be adopted to oblige those, to a punctual discharge of duty, who are indifferent about their continuance in the service, and are often seeking a pretext to disengage themselves from it. Punishment in this case will be unavailing; but when an officer's
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018259_0015_0FA5BDDA84235F38"/>
commission is made valuable to him, and he fears to lose it, you may then exact obedience from him. It is not indeed consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with reason, or justice, to expect, that one set of men should make a sacrifice of property, domestic ease and happiness—en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the rigours of the field—the perils and vicissitudes of war, to obtain those blessings which every citizen will enjoy, in common with them, without some adequate compensation. It must also be a comfortless reflection to any man, that after he may have contributed to securing the rights of his country, at the risk of his life, and the ruin of his fortune, there would be no provision made to prevent himself and family from sinking into indigence and wretchedness. Besides adopting some me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to make the provision for officers, equal to their present exigencies, a due regard should be paid to futurity. Nothing, in my opinion, would serve more powerfully to reanimate their languishing zeal, and interest them thoroughly in the service, than a half-pay establishment. This would not only dispel the apprehension of personal distress, at the termination of the war, from having thrown themselves out of professions and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they might not have it in their power to resume; but would in a great degree, relieve the painful anticipation of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their widows and orphans a burthen on the charity of their country, should it be their lot to fall in its defence.</p>
               <p>I am earnest in recommending this measure, because I know it is the general with and expectation; and that many officers, whom, upon every principle we should wish to retain in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, are only waiting to see whether something of the kind will, or will not take place, to be determined in their resolutions, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of staying in or quitting it immediately; and I urge my sentiments with the greater freedom, because I cannot, and shall not, receive the smallest benefit from the establishment, and can have no other inducement for proposing it, than a full conviction of its utility and propriety.</p>
               <p>I am sensible the expence will be a capital objection to it; but to this I oppose the necessity.—The officers are now discontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with their situation;—if some generous expedient is not embraced to remove their discontent, so extensive a desertion of the service will ensue, and so much discouragement be cast up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on those who remain, as must wound it in a very essential man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: Every thing that has this effect, has a tendency at least to protract the war; and though dictated by a well intended fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, will, I fear, in the end, prove erroneous oeconomy.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved unanimously,</hi> That all military officers commissioned by Congress, who now are or hereafter may be in the service of the United States, and shall continue therein during the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved unanimously,</hi> That every non-commissioned military officer and soldier who hath enlisted, or shall enlist into the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of these States, for during the war, and shall continue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in to the end thereof, shall be entitled to receive a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of eighty dollars at the expiration of the war.</p>

                  <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the resolution of the 15th day of May, 1778, granting half-pay for seven years, to the officers of the army who should continue in service to the end of the war, be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the widows of those officers who have died or shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after die in the service, to commence from the time of such of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer's death, and continue for the term of seven years; or if there be no widow, or in case of her death or intermarriage, the said half-pay be given to the orphan children of the officer dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as aforesaid, if he shall have left any; and that it be recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to the legislatures of the respective states to which such officers belong, to make provision for paying the same on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the United States.</p>

               <head>These resolutions, for a short time, produced the desired effect; but the encreasing distresses of the army, in the subsequent years, arising from the inability of the public to perform their engagements, caused such discontents and uneasinesses, that alarming consequences were feared; at the same time, the reform of the army, which was proposed to take place by the resolution of Congress of the 3d of October, 1780—not a little irritated their minds, already soured by disappointment. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these circumstances the following part of a letter from the Commander in Chief was written to Congress:</head>
               <head>TRANSCRIPT of a LETTER from General WASHINGTON, to the PRESIDENT of CONGRESS, dated near Passaick-Falls, October 11, 1780.</head>
               <p>THAT there are the most conclusive reasons for reducing the number of regiments, no person acquainted with the situation of our affairs and the state of the army, will deny.—A want of officers, independent of other considerations, were suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to compel us.—But that the temper of the army, produced by its sufferings, requires great caution, in any reforms that are attempted, is a position not less evident than the former. In services the best established, where the hands of government are strengthened by the strongest interests of the army to submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the reducing its regiments, and dismissing great part of its officers, is always a measure of delicacy and difficulty. In ours, where the officers are held by the feeblest ties, and are moul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering away by daily resignations, it is peculiarly so.—The last reduction occasioned many to quit the service, besides those who were reformed, and left durable seeds of discontent among those who remained.</p>
               <p>The general topic of declamation was, that it was as hard as dishonorable for men, who had made every sacrifice to the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, to be turned out of it at the pleasure of those in power, without an adequate compensation. In the maturity to which their uneasinesses have now arisen, from a continuance in mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery, they will be still more impatient under an attempt of a si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar nature.—How far these dispositions may be reasonable, I pretend not to decide, but in the extremity to which we are ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, policy forbids us to add new irritations.—Too many of the officers wish to get rid of their commissions, but they are not willing to be forced to it. It is not the intention of these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks to discourage a reform, but to shew the necessity of guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing against the ill effects, by an ample provision, both for the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018259_0018_0FA5BDDC55364C40"/>
officers who stay, and for those who are reduced;—This should be the basis of the plan, and without it, I apprehend the most mischievous consequences. This would obviate many scruples that will otherwise be found prejudicial in the extreme. I am convinced Congress are not a little straitened in the means of a present provision, so ample as to give satisfaction, but this proves the expediency of a future one,—and brings me to that which I have so frequently recommended, as the most oeconomical, the most politic and the most effectual that could be devised, a half-pay for life. Supported by a prospect of a permanent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, the officers would be tied to the service, and would submit to many momentary privations and to the inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which the situation of public affairs makes unavoidable. This is exemplified in the Pennsylvania officers, who being up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this establishment, are so much interested in the service, that in the course of many months there has been only one resigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in that line.</p>
               <p>If the objection, drawn from the principle of this measure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incompatible with the genius of our government, is thought insurmountable, I would propose a substitute, less eligible in my opinion, but which may answer the purpose; it is to make the present half-pay for seven years, whole pay for the same period, to be advanced at two different payments, one half in a year after the conclusion of peace, the other half in two years subsequent to the first.</p>
               <p>No objection to this measure occurs to me, except it be tho't too great an expence; but in my judgment, whatever can give consistency to our military establishment, will be ultimately fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable to oeconomy. It is not easy to be conceived, except by those who are witnesses to it, what an additional waste and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption of every thing, and consequently what an encrease of expence, results from the laxness of discipline in the army. And where the officers think they are doing the public a favor, by holding their commissions, and the men are continually fluctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating, it is impossible to maintain discipline. Nothing can be to me more obvious, than that a found military establishment, and the interest of oeconomy, are the same. How much more the purposes of the war would be promoted by it, in other res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, will not admit of an argument.</p>
               <p>In reasoning upon the measure of a future provision, I have heard gentlemen object, the want of it in some foreign armies, without adverting to the difference of circumstances. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018259_0019_0FA5BDDD46A59D48"/>
state holds the first rank in most of the countries of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and is the road to honor and emolument. The establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is permanent, and whatever be an officer's provision, it is for life,—and he has a profession for life. He has future, as well as present motives of military honor and preferment; he is attached to the service, by the spirit of government, by educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in most cases, by early habit; his present condition, though not splendid, is comfortable, pensions and distinctions and particular privileges, are commonly his reward in retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In the case of the American officers, the military cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter has been suddenly taken up, and is to end with the war.</p>
               <p>Congress will herewith receive a list of the officers in the New-Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Maryland line, previous to its march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the southward, also Crane's and Lamb's artillery, Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, 8 horse, and in Hazen's, Sherburne's, Spencer's and Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston's regiments, who have actually had their resignations en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered at Head-Quarters, in the course of this year; and who in general urged their necessities, when they applied on the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and insisted, notwithstanding every persuasion to induce their continuance, that their circumstances would not admit of their remaining in service longer,—besides those resignations, there are a great many of which I have no certain account, as the officers being permitted to go home on furlough, in the course of the last winter, have never rejoined the army, and have only sent messages or written to their regimental officers, that their own distresses and those of their families would not permit their return.</p>
               <p>As to the resignations which have taken place in the Virginia line, and the other troops at the southward, since they were act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in that quarter, I have no account of them, but I make no doubt that many have happened.</p>
               <p>All these serve to shew the necessity of some more competent establishment than the present one,—and I hold it my duty to mention, from the accounts I daily receive, unless this is the case, that I have strong reasons to believe, we shall not be able to retain, after the end of the campaign, as many officers, especially in some lines, as will be even sufficient for common duties when in quarters.</p>
               <p>If matters fortunately should not proceed, to the lengths my fears forebode, yet Congress will be sensible, at the first view,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:018259_0020_0FA5BDDDF5A13F80"/>
of the injuries and great inconveniences, which must attend such a continual change of officers, and consequent promotions which are and will be inevitable.</p>

               <head>Soon after Congress were pleased to pass the following resolutions:</head>
               <head>IN CONGRESS, OCTOBER 21, 1780.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the Commander in Chief, and Commanding Officer in the southern department, direct the officers of each state to meet and agree upon the officers for the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be raised by their respective states, from those who incline to continue in service; and, where it cannot be done by agreement, to be determined by seniority, and make return of those who are to remain, which is to be transmitted to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, together with the names of the officers reduced, who are to be allowed half-pay for life.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the officers who shall continue in the service to the end of the war, shall be entitled to half-pay during life, to commence from the time of their reduction.</p>

               <p>These resolutions of Congress gave that satisfaction to the army which their wants and sufferings demanded, and the United States have since had no cause but to rejoice that their well-timed generosity has produced the most happy effects, for it is well known to all who were conversant with the state of the army in the year 1780, that the ability of the public was to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally inadequate to their just demands, and that any thing less than the resolutions which Congress passed at that time, would have put an end to the American opposition:—Since that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod the army, confidentially relying on the resolutions of Congress, have endured hunger, poverty and want, without a murmur, and with cheerfulness have encountered dangers which their profession demanded, knowing, that in some fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture period a generous public would pour the oil of gratitude into their wounds, and cause their grey hairs to rejoice;—this confidence would have remained unshaken, if the ungrateful sentiments which had been frequently propagated by some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terested persons, "That Congress did not mean to comply with their resolutions for half-pay," had not produced that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easiness in the army which caused the following proceedings:</p>

                           <head>TO THE UNITED STATES IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED. The ADDRESS and PETITION of the OFFICERS of the ARMY of the UNITED STATES:</head>
                           <opener>Humbly sheweth,</opener>
                           <p>THAT we the officers of the army of the United States, in behalf of ourselves and our brethren the soldiers, beg leave with all proper deference and respect, freely to state to Congress, the supreme power of the United States, the great distress under which we labour.</p>
                           <p>At this present period of the war, it is with peculiar pain, we find ourselves constrained to address your august body on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a pecuniary nature.</p>
                           <p>We have struggled with our difficulties year after year, under the hopes that each would be last, but we have been disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. We find our embarrassments thicken so fast and have become so complex, that many of us are unable to go further.</p>
                           <p>In this exigence we apply to Congress for relief as our head and sovereign.</p>
                           <p>To prove that our hardships are exceedingly disproportionate to those of any other citizens of America, let a recurrence be had to the Pay-master's accompts for four years past.—If to this it should be objected, that the respective States have made set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements and given securities for the pay due for part of that time, let the present value of those nominal obligations be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained by the monied men, and they will be found to be worth but little indeed; and yet trifling as they are, many have been under the sad necessity of parting with them, to prevent their families from actually starving.</p>
                           <p>We complain that shadows have been offered to us, while the substance has been gleaned by every person bearing the mark of civil authority throughout the United States.—Our situation compels us to search for the cause of our extreme poverty.—The citizens murmur at the greatness of their taxes, and are astonished that no part reaches the army. The numerous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which are between the first collectors and the soldiers swallow up the whole.</p>
                           <p>
                              <pb n="22" facs="unknown:018259_0022_0FA5BDDF55FC5390"/>
Our distresses are now brought to a point. We have borne all that we can bear, our property is expended—our private resources are at an end—and our friends are wearied out and disgusted with our incessant applications. We therefore most seriously and earnestly beg, that a supply of money may be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded to the army as soon as possible. The uneasiness of the soldiers, for want of pay, is great and dangerous; any further experiments on their patience, may have fatal effects.</p>
                           <p>The promised subsistence or ration of provisions consisted of certain articles, specified in kind and quantity; this ration, without regard, that we can conceive, to the health of the troops, has been frequently altered as necessity or conveniency suggested, generally losing by the change some part of its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. On an average, not more than seven or eight tenths have been issued, the retained parts were for a short time paid for; but the business became trouble some to those who were to execute it.—For this or some other reasons, all regard to the dues, as they respected the soldiers, has been discontinued (now and then a trifling gratuity excepted.—As these dues respected the officers, they were compensated during one year, and part of another, by an extra ration as to the retained rations, the account for several years remained unsettled; there is a large balance due upon it; and a considerable sum for that of forage.</p>
                           <p>The cloathing was another part of the soldiers hire—the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages on that score, for the year 1777, were paid off in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiental money, when the dollar was worth about fourpence; the arrearages for the following years are unliquidated, and we apprehend scarcely thought of but by the army.—Whenever there has been a real want of means—any defect in system, or neglect in execution, in the departments of the army, we have inevitably been the sufferers, by hunger and nakedness, and by lanquishing in a hospital. We beg leave to urge an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate adjustment of all dues; that, as great a part as possible be paid and the remainder put on such a footing as will restore cheerfulness to the army, revive confidence in the justice and generosity of its constituents, and contribute to the very desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect of re-establishing public credit.</p>
                           <p>We are grieved to find that our brethren, who retired from service on half-pay under the resolution of Congress in 1780 are, not only destitute of any effectual provision, but are become the objects of obloquy.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Their condition has a very discouraging
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018259_0023_0FA5BDE0048E0018"/>
aspect on us, who must sooner or later retire, and, from every con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, gratitude and policy, demands attention and redress.</p>
                           <p>We regard the act of Congress respecting half-pay, as an honorable and just recompence for several years hard service, in which the health and fortunes of the officers have been worn down and exhausted.—We see with chagrin the odious point of view, in which the citizens of too many of the states endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to place the men entitled to it.</p>
                           <p>We hope for the honor of human nature, that there are none, so hardened in the sin of ingratitude, as to deny the justice of the reward. We have reason to believe that the objection ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, is against the mode only<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—To prevent therefore any altercations and distinctions which may tend to injure that har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, which we ardently desire may reign throughout the community, we are willing to commute the half-pay pledged, for full pay for a certain number of years, or for a sum in gross, as shall be agreed on by the Committee sent with this address.</p>
                           <p>To the representation now made, the army have not a doubt that Congress will pay all that attention, which the serious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it requires. It would be criminal in the officers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the general dissatisfaction which prevails, and is gaining ground in the army, from the pressure of evils and injuries, which, in the course of seven long years, have made their condition, in many instances, wretched.—They therefore intreat that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress (to convince the army and the world, that the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of America shall not be placed on the ruin of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular class of citizens) will point out a mode for immediate redress. And in this we pray, that the disabled officers and soldiers, with the widows and orphans of those who have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended or may expend their lives in the service of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, may be fully comprehended. We also beg, that some mode may be pointed out for the eventual payment of those sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, who are the subjects of the resolution of Congress of the 15th of May, 1778.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018259_0024_0FA5BDE1443E97F8"/>

               <head>Soon after the Committee of the army made the following ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral report to Major General Knox, with whom they had been directed to correspond on the subjects of the foregoing petition to Congress.</head>

                  <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE army has, no doubt, been anxious to hear from us, and we should have had as much pleasure in communicating to them any success of our application for them, as they are to receive it: But nothing of any moment has yet been decided for them. We spent the first week, after our arrival, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with the members of Congress on the subject of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress; to prepare them for the reception of it before it was read, left the want of information, should retard a favorable resolution on it. On its being read, a Committee was appointed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with us, consisting of a member from each state, but Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia; which was unrepresented, and had no member attending. The Financier attending at this meeting. To this Committee we communicated the condition of the army, and we dilated ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diffusely all the subjects stated in the address; indeed truth and decency were the only bounds observed in our conference with them. The reason of our applying to Congress to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine on a compensation for half-pay, was also minutely detailed.</p>
               <p>The result as to present pay, will be communicated to you by Colonel Brooks. On this subject we can only commit to paper, that a months pay in notes to the officers, and one to the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commissioned and privates, at weekly payments of half a dollar per week to the latter, is all that can be now obtained. This grand Committee appointed a Sub-Committee to converse with us, as occasion should require, if any new matter occurred to us; and to inspect critically into the principles of annuities, in order to determine on an equivalent for the half-pay.</p>
               <p>In about ten days they reported to the grand Committee, that twelve years was a mean life of the ages of the officers of the army; and that six whole years pay was equal to the country and the army, to the half-pay for life. The Committee then reported to Congress, which produced the resolutions which have been transmitted to the Commander in Chief. That part of the report which respected the value of the half-pay, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>committed to a smaller Committee, the number of years being considered too many.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:018259_0026_0FA5BDE3D67340E0"/>
This Committee took up some time to examine calculations on annuities, and two days ago they reported five years whole pay as equal to the half-pay for life, but nine states would not approve the report, Georgia, Maryland and Delaware unrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented. We advised our friends not to press for a determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they could not carry the question, as the sense of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Delaware were known to be favorable to us, and their delegates were daily expected in town.—On discussion in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, some of the members opposed to the commutation, and equally so to half-pay, expressed a desire to put off the question, to give them time for more consideration; it was accordingly granted. Thus stands the matter of commutation.</p>
               <p>Massachusetts, New-York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North and South-Carolina were for the equivalent; New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island, Connecticut, and Jersey were against it. There is some prospect of getting one or more of these states to vote for the commutation. If this is accomplished, with Maryland and Delaware, the question will be carried. Whenever it is, as the report now stands, it will be at the election of a line, as such, to accept of the commutation or retain their claim to the half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay, Congress being determined that no alteration shall take place in the emolument held out to the army, but by their consent.</p>
               <p>This rendered it unnecessary for us to consult the army on the equivalent for the half-pay.—The zeal of a great number of members of Congress to get continental funds, while a few wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have us referred to the states, induced us to conceal what funds we wished, or expected, left our declaration for one or the other, might retard a settlement of our occounts, or a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination on the equivalent for the half pay. Indeed some of our best friends in Congress declared, however desirous they were to have our accounts settled, and the commutation fixed, as well as to get funds, yet they would oppose referring us to the states for a settlement and security, till all prospect of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining continental funds was at an end.</p>
               <p>Whether this is near or not, as commutation for the half-pay was one of the principal objects of the address, the obtaining of that is necessary, previous to our particularizing what fund will be most agreeable to us: This must be determined by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.—If Congress get funds we shall be secured. If not, the equivalent settled, a principal will be established, which will be more acceptable to the eastern states than half-pay, if application must be made to them.—As it is not likely that Congress will
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018259_0027_0FA5BDE4E28A54B8"/>
be able to determine soon on the commutation (for the reasons above mentioned) it is judged necessary that Colonel Brooks re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the army, to give them a more particular detail of our prospects than can be done in the compass of a letter. It is however thought proper that General M'Dougal should remain in Philadelphia, to endeavor at a proper time to bring on the determination of Congress, on the important question; as well as to quicken the accomplishment of the other points contained in the address. In the mean time Colonel Ogden visits his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, as well as to do some business, which will greatly promote the object of our being sent here. Colonel Ogden will however return if it should be judged necessary. We conceived it expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to make the army this general report, and beg leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer you to Colonel Brooks for a more particular one.</p>

               <p>A FELLOW-SOLDIER, whose interests and affections bind him strongly to you, whose past sufferings have been as great, and whose future fortunes may be as desperate as yours—would beg leave to address you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="unknown:018259_0028_0FA5BDE55F511318"/>
Age has its claims, and rank is not without its pretentions to advise; but though unsupported by both, he flatters himself, that the plain language of sincerity and experience, will neither be unheard nor unregarded.</p>
               <p>Like many of you, he loved private life, and left it with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret.—He left it, determined to retire from the field, with the necessity that called him to it, and not till then,—not till the enemies of his country, the slaves of power and the hirelings of injustice, were compelled to abandon their schemes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge America as terrible in arms, as she had been humble in remonstrance.—With this object in view, he has long shared in your toils, and mingled in your dangers,—he has felt the cold hand of poverty, without a murmur, and has seen the insolence of wealth, without a sigh.—But too much under the direction of his wishes, and sometimes weak enough to mistake desire for opinion, he has till lately, very lately, believed in the justice of his country.—He hoped that as the clouds of adversity scattered, and as the sunshine of peace and better fortune broke in upon us,—the coldness and severity of government would relax, and that more than justice, that gratitude, would blaze forth upon those hands, which had upheld her, in the darkest stages of her passage, from impending servitude, to acknowledged indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</p>
               <p>But faith has its limits as well as temper, and there are points, beyond which neither can be stretched without sinking into cowardice, or plunging into credulity.—This, my friends, I conceive to be your situation—hurried to the very verge of both, another step would ruin you forever.—To be tame and unprovoked, when injuries press hard upon you, is more than weakness, but to look up for kinder usage, without one manly effort of your own, would fix your character, and shew the world how richly you deserve those chains you broke. To guard against this evil, let us take a view of the ground upon which we now stand, and from thence carry our thoughts forward, for a moment, into the unexplored field of expedient.</p>
               <p>After a pursuit of seven long years, the object for which we set out, is at length brought within our reach.—Yes, my friends, that suffering courage of yours, was active once; it has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the United States of America, through a doubtful and a bloody war—it has placed her in the chair of independency, and peace returns again to bless—Whom? A country willing to redress your wrongs, cherish your worth, and reward your
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018259_0029_0FA5BDE912846310"/>
services?—A country courting your return to private life, with tears of gratitude and smiles of admiration?—Longing to divide with you that independency which your gallantry has given, and those riches which your wounds have preserved?—Is this the case? Or is it rather a country that tramples upon your rights, disdains your cries, and insults your distresses?—Have you not more than once suggested your wishes, and made known your wants to Congress (wants and wishes which gratitude and policy should have anticipated, rather than evaded) and have you not lately, in the meek language of entreating memorials, begged from their justice what you could no longer expect from their favour? How have you been answered?—Let the letter which you are called to consider to-morrow, make reply!—If this then be your treatment, while the swords you wear are necessary for the defence of America, what have you to expect from peace; when your voice shall sink, and your strength dissipate by divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on—when those very swords, the instruments and companions of your glory, shall be taken from your sides, and no remaining mark of military distinction left, but your wants, infirmities and scars.—Can you then consent to be the only sufferers by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution,—and retiring from the field, grow old in poverty, wretchedness and contempt?—Can you consent to wade through the vile mire of dependency, and owe the miserable remnant of that life to charity, which has hitherto been spent in honor?—If you can—Go—and carry with you, the jest of Tories, and the scorn of Whigs—the ridicule, and what is worse—the pity of the world.—Go—starve and be forgotten.—But if your spirits should revolt at this, if you have sense enough to discover, and spirit sufficient to oppose tyranny, under whatever garb it may assume—whether it be the plain coat of republicanism—or the splendid robe of royalty;—if you have yet learned to discrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, between a people and cause—between men and principles,—awake, attend to your situation and redress yourselves. If the present moment be lost, every future effort is in vain—your threats then, will be as empty, as your entreaties now. I would advise you therefore, to come to some final opinion, of what you can bear and what you will suffer. If your determination be in any proportion to your wrongs—carry your appeal from the justice to the fears of government. Change the milk and water stile of your last memorial.—Assume a bolder tone, decent, but lively, spirited and determined;—and suspect the man who would advise to more moderation, and longer forbearance. Let two or three men who can feel as well as write, be appointed to draw up your last remonstrance (for I would no longer give it the sueing, soft, unsuccessful epithet of memorial) Let is
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018259_0030_0FA5BDEB5340B9E8"/>
represent in language, that will neither dishonor you by its rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, nor betray you by its fears—what has been promised by Congress, and what has been performed;—how long and how patiently you have suffered—how little you have asked, and how much of that little has been denied.—Tell them, that though you were the first, and would wish to be the last, to encounter danger—though despair itself can never drive you into disho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, it may drive you from the field.—That the wound often irritated and never healed, may at lengh become incurable,—and that the slightest mark of indignity from Congress now, must operate like the grave, and part you forever. That in any political event, the army has its alternative.—If peace, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing shall separate you from your arms but death.—If war, that courting the auspices, and inviting the direction of your illus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious leader, you will retire to some yet unsettled country, smile in your turn, "and mock when their fear cometh on."—But let it represent also, that should they comply with the request of your late memorial, it would make you more happy, and them more respectable.—That while the war should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, you would follow their standard in the field,—and that when it came to an end, you would withdraw into the shade of private life, and give the world another subject of wonder and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause—an army victorious over its enemies—victorious over itself.</p>

               <head>The next evening the following anonymous Address, marked No. II. was dispersed through the Army:</head>
               <head>No. IV.</head>
               <head>To the OFFICERS of the ARMY.</head>

                  <salute>Gentlemen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE author of the late address, anxious to deserve, tho' he should fail to engage, your esteem, and determined at every risque, to unfold your duty, and discharge his own—would beg leave to solicit the further indulgence of a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments attention.</p>
               <p>Aware of the coyness with which his last letter would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; he feels himself neither disappointed, nor displeased with the caution it has met—He well knew, that it spoke a language, which till now, had been heard only in whispers; and that it contained some sentiments, which confidence itself would have breathed with distrust—But their lives have been short, and their observation imperfect indeed, who have yet to learn, that alarms may be false—that the best designs are sometimes obliged to assume the worst aspect; and that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever synonymous, surprize and disaster may be in military phrase, in moral and political meaning, they convey ideas, as different as they are distinct—<hi>Suspicion,</hi> detestable as it is in private life, is the loveliest trait of political characters. It prompts to enquiry, bars the door against design, and opens every avenue to truth. It was the first to oppose a tyrant here, and still stands sentinel over the liberties of America—With this belief, it would illy become me, to stifle the voice of this honest guardian—A guardian who (authorized by circumstance, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested into proof) has herself given birth to the address you have read, and now goes forth among you, with a request to all, that it may be treated fairly,—that it may be considered before it be abused—and condemned, before it be tortured;—convinced that, in a search after error, truth will appear; that apathy itself will grow warm in the pursuit, and though it will be the last to adopt her advice, it will be the first to act upon it.</p>
               <p>The general order of yesterday, which the weak may mistake for disapprobation, and the designing dare to represent as such, wears, in my opinion, a very different complexion, and carries with it a very opposite tendency.</p>

                  <pb n="32" facs="unknown:018259_0032_0FA5BDED1F7037C0"/>
Till now, the Commander in Chief has regarded the stops you have taken for redress, with good wishes alone,—his ostensible silence has authorized your meetings, and his private opinion has sanctified your claims. Had he disliked the object in view, would not the same sense of duty, which forbad your meeting on the third day of the week, have forbidden you from meeting on the seventh?—Is not the same subject held up for your dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and has it not passed the seal of office, and taken all the solemnity of an order?—This will give system to your proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and stability to your resolves. It will ripen speculation in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fact, and while it adds to the unanimity, it cannot possibly lessen the <hi>independency</hi> of your sentiments. It may be necessary to add upon this subject, that from the injunction with which the general orders close, every man is at liberty to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the <hi>report</hi> to be made to <hi>Head-Quarters,</hi> is intended for <hi>Congress.</hi> Hence will arise another motive for that <hi>energy</hi> which has been recommended. For, can you give the lie to the pathetic descriptions of your representations, and the more alarming predictions of your friends?</p>
               <p>To such as make a want of signature, an objection to opinion, I reply,—that it matters very little, who is the author of senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which grow out of your feelings and apply to your wants. That in this instance dissidence suggested what experience en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins; and that, while I continue to move on the high road of argument and advice (which is open to all) I shall continue to be the sole confident of my own secret. But should the time come, when it shall be necessary to depart from this general line, and hold up any individual among you as an object of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentment or contempt of the rest, I thus publicly pledge my honor as a soldier, and veracity as a man, that I will then as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume a visible existence, and give my name to the army, with as little reserve as I now give my opinions.

                  <dateline>HEAD-QUARTERS, NEWBURGH, <date>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>THE result of the proceedings of the grand convention of officers, which I have the honor of enclosing to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency for the inspection of Congress, will, I flatter myself, be considered as the last glorious proof of patriotism, which could have been given by men who aspired to the distinction of a patriot army, and will not only confirm their claim to the justice, but will encrease their title to the gratitude of their country.</p>
               <p>Having seen the proceedings on the part of the army, termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with perfect unanimity, and in a manner entirely conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to my wishes; being impressed with the liveliest senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of affection for those, who have so long, so patiently and so cheerfully suffered and fought under my immediate di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, having from motives of justice, duty and gratitude, spontaneously offered myself, as an advocate for their rights; and having been requested to write to your Excellency, earn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estly entreating the most speedy decision of Congress upon the subjects of the late address from the army to that honorable body,—it now only remains for me to perform the task I have assumed,—and to intercede in their behalf as I now do, that the sovereign power will be pleased to verify the predictions I have pronounced of, and the confidence the army have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed in, the justice of their country.—And here, I humbly conceive, it is altogether unnecessary (while I am pleading the cause of an army which have done and suffered more than any other army ever did, in the defence of the rights and liberties of human nature) to expatiate on their <hi>claims</hi> to the most ample compensation for their meritorious services,—because they
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018259_0035_0FA5BDEFD07420B0"/>
are perfectly known to the whole world,—and because (al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the topics are inexhaustible) enough has already been said on the subject. To prove these assertions, to evince that my sentiments have ever been uniform, and to shew what my ideas of the rewards in question have always been,—I appeal to the archives of Congress, and call on those sacred deposits to witness for me.—And in order that my observations and argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in favor of a future adequate provision for the officers of the army, may be brought to remembrance again, and consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a single point of view, without giving Congress the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of having recourse to their files; I will beg leave to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit herewith, an extract from a representation made by me to a committee of Congress, so long ago as the 29th of January, 1778 <note n="*" place="bottom">See Page 13.</note>,—and also the transcript of a letter to the President of Congress, dated near Passaick-Falls, October 11, 1780<note n="†" place="bottom">See Page 17.</note>.</p>
               <p>That in the critical and perilous moment when the last men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned communication was made, there was the utmost danger, a dissolution of the army would have taken place, unless mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures similar to those recommended, had been adopted, will not admit a doubt. That the adoption of the resolution, granting half-pay for life, has been attended with all the happy conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences I had foretold, so far as respected the good of the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, let the astonishing contrast between the state of the army at this instant, and at the former period determine. And that the establishment of funds, and securities for the payment of all the just demands of the army, will be the most certain means of preserving the national faith and future tranquility of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive continent, is my decided opinion.</p>
               <p>By the preceding remarks it will readily be imagined that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of retracting and reprehending (from farther experience and reflection) the mode of compensation so strenuously urged in the enclosures, I am more and more confirmed in the senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,—and if in the wrong, suffer me to please myself with the grateful delusion.</p>
               <p>For if, besides the simple payment of their wages, a farther compensation is not due to the sufferings and sacrifices of the officers,—then have I been mistaken indeed;—if the whole ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my have not merited, whatever a grateful people can bestow, then I have been beguiled by prejudice, and built opinion on the basis of error. If this country should not in the event, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form every thing which has been requested, in the late memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018259_0036_0FA5BDF09CE13FE0"/>
to Congress, then will my belief become vain, and the hope that has been excited void of foundation. And if (as has been suggested for the purpose of inflaming their passions) the officers of the army, are to be the only sufferers by this revolution,—if, "retiring from the field they are to grow old in poverty, wretchedness and contempt,—if they are to wade through the vile mire of dependency, and owe the miserable remnant of that life to charity, which has hitherto been spent in honor,"—then shall I have learned what ingratitude is, then shall I have realiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a tale, which will imbitter every moment of my future life:—But I am under no such apprehensions, a country rescued by their arms from impending ruin, will never leave unpaid the debt of gratitude.</p>
               <p>Should any intemperate or improper warmth, have mingled itself amongst the foregoing observations,—I must entreat your Excellency and Congress, it may be attributed to the effusion of an honest zeal in the best of causes, and that my peculiar situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation may be my apology;—and I hope I need not, on this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentuous occasion, make any new protestations, of personal disinterestedness, having ever renounced for myself, the idea of pecuniary reward. The consciousness of having attempted, faithfully to discharge my duty, and the approbation of my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, will be a sufficient recompence for my services.</p>

                  <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BY an anonymous summons, an attempt has been made to convene you together,—how inconsistent with the rules of propriety! How unmilitary! And how subversive of all good order and discipline!—Let the good sense of the army decide!</p>
               <p>In the moment of this summons, another anonymous produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was sent into circulation; addressed more to the feelings and passions, than to the reason and judgment of the army. The author of the piece, is entituled to much credit for the goodness of his pen, and I could wish he had as much credit for the rectitude of his heart; for as men see through different op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, and are induced by the reflecting faculties of the mind, to use different means to obtain the same end,—the author of the address, should have had more charity, than to mark for suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, the man, who shall recommend moderation and longer forbearance,—or in other words, who shall not think as he thinks, and act as he advises.—But he had another plan in view, in which candor and liberality of sentiment, regard to justice, and love of country, have no part; and he was right to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinuate the darkest suspicion, to effect the blackest designs.</p>
               <p>That the address is drawn with great art, and is designed to answer the most insidious purposes, that it is calculated to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the mind, with an idea of premeditated injustice in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign power of the United States, and rouse all those resent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which must unavoidably flow from such a belief,—that the secret mover of this scheme (whoever he may be) intended to take advantage of the passions while they were warmed, by the recollection of past distresses, without giving time for cool, deliberate thinking, and that composure of mind, which is so necessary to give dignity and stability to measures, is rendered too obvious, by the mode of conducting the business, to need other proof, than a reference to the proceeding.</p>
               <p>Thus much, Gentlemen, I have thought it incumbent on me to observe to you, to shew upon what principles, I opposed the irregular and hasty meeting, which, was proposed to have been held on Tuesday last, and not because, I wanted a disposition to give you every opportunity, consistent with your own honor, and the dignity of the army, to make known your grievances.—If my conduct heretofore has not evinced to you that I have been a faithful friend to the army, my declaration of it at this time, would be equally unavailing and improper; but as I was among the first who embarked in the cause of our common country;
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018259_0038_0FA5BDF21712F798"/>
as I have never left your side one moment, but when called from you on public duty; as I have been the constant companion and witness of your distresses, and not among the last to feel and acknowledge your merits; as I have ever considered my own military reputation, as inseparably connected with that of the army, as my heart has ever expanded with joy, when I have heard its praises, and my indignation has arisen, when the mouth of detraction has been opened against it,—it can <hi>scarcely be supposed,</hi> at this late stage of the war, that I am indifferent to its interests.—But—how are they to be promoted?—The way is plain, says the anonymous addresser—if war continues, remove into the unsettled country,—there establish yourselves, and leave an ungrateful country to defend itself.—But who are they to defend?—Our wives, our children, our farms and other property which we leave behind us?—Or, in the state of hostile separation, are we to take the two first (the latter can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be removed) to perish in a wilderness with hunger, cold and nakedness?—If peace takes place, never sheath your swords (says he) until you have obtained full and ample justice:—This dreadful alternative, of either deserting our country, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremest hour of distress, or turning our arms against it, (which is the apparent object, unless Congress can be compelled into instant compliance) has something so shocking in it,—that huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity revolts at the idea.—My God!—what can this writer have in view by recommending such measures? Can he be a friend to the army? Can he be a friend to this country?—Rather is he not an insidious foe?—some emissary, perhaps, from New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York, plotting the ruin of both, by sowing the seeds of discord and separation between the civil and military powers of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent?—And what a compliment does he pay to our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standings, when he recommends measures, in either alternative, impracticable in their nature?</p>
               <p>But here, Gentlemen, I will drop the curtain,—because it would be as imprudent in me, to assign my reasons for this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, as it would be insulting to your conception, to suppose you stood in need of them.—A moment's reflection, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince every dispassionate mind, of the physical impossibility, of carrying either proposal into execution.</p>
               <p>There might, Gentlemen, be an impropriety in my taking notice, in this address to you, of an anonymous production,—but the manner in which that performance has been introduced to the army,—the effect it was intended to have, together with some other circumstances, will amply justify my oservations, on
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018259_0039_0FA5BDF2D4B65288"/>
the tendency of that writing. With respect to the advice given by the author to suspect the man, who shall recommend moder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate measures and longer forbearance, I spurn it,—as every man who regards that liberty, and reveres that justice, for which we contend, undoubtedly must.—For if men are to be precluded from offering their sentiments on a matter, which may involve the most serious and alarming consequences, that can invite the consideration of mankind, reason is of no use to us;—the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of speech may be taken away, and dumb and silent, we may be led like sheep to the slaughter.</p>
               <p>I cannot in justice to my own belief, and what I have great reason to conceive is the intention of Congress, conclude this address without giving it as my decided opinion, that that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable body, entertain exalted sentiments of the services of the army, and from a full conviction of its merits and sufferings, will do it compleat justice. That their endeavors to discover and establish funds for this purpose, have been unwearied, and will not cease till they have succeeded, I have no doubt; but, like all other large bodies, where there is a variety of different interests to reconcile, their deliberations are slow.—Why then should we distrust them? and, in consequence of that distrust, adopt measures, which may cast a shade, over that glory which has been so justly acquired, and tarnish the reputation of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which is celebrated through all Europe, for its fortitude and patriotism? and for what is this done?—to bring the object we seek nearer?—No—most certainly, in my opinion, it will cast it at a greater distance.</p>
               <p>For myself (and I take no merit in giving the assurance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing induced to it from principles of gratitude, veracity and jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice)—a grateful sense of the confidence you have ever placed in me, a recollection of the chearful assistance, and prompt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience I have experienced from you, under every vicissitude of fortune, and the sincere affection I feel for an army, I have so long had the honor to command,—will oblige me to declare, in this public and solemn manner; that, in the attainment of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete justice, for all your toils and dangers, and in the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every wish, so far as may be done consistently with the great duty I owe my country, and those powers we are bound to respect, you may freely command my services to the utmost extent of my abilities.</p>
               <p>While I give you these assurances, and pledge myself in the most unequivocal manner, to exert whatever ability I am posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018259_0040_0FA5BDF389473A98"/>
of, in your favor, let me intreat you, Gentlemen, on your part, not to take any measures, which, viewed in the calm light of reason, will lessen the dignity, and fully the glory you have hitherto maintained. Let me request you, to rely on the plight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed faith of your country, and place a full confidence in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the intentions of Congress, that previous to your dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as an army they will cause all your accounts to be fairly liquidated, as directed in their resolutions which were publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to you two days ago, and that they will adopt the most effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual measures in their power, to render ample justice to you, for your faithful and meritorious services. And let me conjure you in the name of our common country, as you value your own sacred honor, as you respect the rights of humanity, and as you regard the military and national character of America, to express your utmost horror and detestation of the man who wishes, under any specious pretences, to overturn the liberties of our country, and who wickedly attempts to open the flood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates of civil discord, and deluge our rising empire in blood.</p>
               <p>By thus determining and thus acting, you will pursue the plain and direct road to the attainment of your wishes; you will defeat the insidious designs of our enemies, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to resort from open force to secret artifice. You will give one more distinguished proof of unexampled patriotism and patient virtue, rising superior to the pressure of the most complicated sufferings; and you will, by the dignity of your conduct, afford occasion for posterity to say, when speaking of the glorious example you have exhibited to mankind, had this day been wanting, the world had never seen the last stage of perfection to which human nature is capable of attaining.</p>
               <p>His Excellency having withdrawn, on motion made by General Knox, seconded by General Putnam,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved,</hi> That the unanimous thanks of the officers of the army be presented to his Excellency the commander in chief, for his excellent address, and the communications he has been pleased to make to them; and to assure him that the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers reciprocate his affectionate expressions, with the greatest sincerity of which the human heart is capable.</p>
               <p>The address from the army to Congress—the report of the committee from the army—and the resolutions of Congress of the 25th of January, being read,—on a motion by General Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, seconded by General Hand,</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:018259_0041_0FA5BDF44866B220"/>
                  <hi>Voted,</hi> That a committee be appointed immediately to draw up some resolutions, expressive of the business before us, and report in half an hour; that this committee consist of one Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, one Field-Officer, and one Captain:</p>
               <p>That General Knox, Colonel Brooks, and Captain Howard, compose the said committee.</p>
               <p>The report of the committee having been brought in, and fully considered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved unanimously,</hi> That at the commencement of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent war, the officers of the American army, engaged in the service of their country from the purest love, and attachment to the rights and liberties of human nature; which motives still exist in the highest degree; and that no circumstance of distress or danger, shall induce a conduct, that may tend to sully the reputation and glory, which they have acquired at the price of their blood, and eight years faithful services.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved unanimously,</hi> That the army continue to have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaken confidence in the justice of Congress and their country; and are fully convinced that the representatives of America will not disband or disperse the army, until their accompts are li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidated, the balances accurately ascertained, and adequate funds established for payment.</p>
               <p>And in this arrangement the officers expect that the half pay, or commutation of it, should be efficaciously comprehended.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved unanimously,</hi> That his Excellency the Commander in Chief be requested to write to his Excellency the President of Congress, earnestly entreating the more speedy decision of that honorable body, upon the subjects of our late address, which was forwarded by a committee of the army, some of whom are waiting upon Congress for the result. In the alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native of peace or war, this event would be highly satisfactory, and would produce immediate tranquillity in the minds of the army; and prevent any further machinations of designing men, to sow discord between the civil and military powers of the United States.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved unanimously,</hi> That the officers of the American ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my view with abhorrence, and reject with disdain, the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous propositions contained in a late anonymous address to the officers of the army, and resent with indignation, the secret at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of some unknown persons, to collect the officers toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in a manner totally subversive of all discipline and good order.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved unanimously,</hi> That the thanks of the officers of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my

my be given to the committee, who presented to Congress the late address of the army, for the wisdom and prudence with which they have conducted that business; and that a copy of the proceedings of this day be transmitted by the President to Major-General M'Dougal; and that he be requested to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue his solicitations at Congress, until the objects of his mission are accomplished.</p>

               <p>On the report of a committee, to whom was referred a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. Dver, together with the memorial of the army, and report of the committee thereon;—Congress came to the following resolutions:</p>
               <p>Whereas the officers of the several lines, under the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate command of his Excellency General Washington, did by their late memorial transmitted, represent to Congress, that the half-pay granted by sundry resolutions, was regarded in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favourable light by the citizens of some of these States, who would prefer a compensation for a limited term of years, or by a sum in gross, to an establishment for life; and did on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, solicit a commutation of their half-pay, for an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in one of the modes above-mentioned, in order to remove
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018259_0043_0FA5BDF60DAD9640"/>

               <p>
                  <hi>Resolved,</hi> That such officers as are now in service, and shall continue therein to the end of the war, shall be entitled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the amount of five years full pay in money or securities, on interest at six percent per annum, as Congress shall find most convenient, instead of the half pay promised for life, by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of the 21st day of October, 1780—the said securities to be such as shall be given to the creditors of the United States: Provided that it be at the option of the lines of the respective states, and not of officers individually in those lines, to accept or refuse the same; and provided also, that their election shall be signified to Congress through the Commander in Chief, from the lines under his immediate command, within two months; and through the commanding officer of the southren army, from those under his command, within six months from the date of this resolution:</p>
               <p>That the same commutation shall extend to the corps not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the lines of particular states, and who are entitled to half-pay for life as aforesaid; the acceptance or refusal to be determined by corps, and to be signified in the same manner, and within the same time, as above mentioned:</p>
               <p>That all officers belonging to the hospital department, who are entitled to half-pay by the resolution of the 17th day of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, 1781, may collectively agree to accept or refuse the aforesaid commutation, signifying the same through the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief, within six months from this time:</p>

               <p>IT is difficult for us to express the regret we feel at being obliged again to solicit your Excellency's attention and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. Next to the anguish which the prospect of our own wretchedness excites in our breasts, is the pain which arises from a knowledge of your anxiety on account of those men who have been the sharers of your fortunes, and have had the honor of being your companions through the various vicissitudes of the war. Nothing, therefore, but necessity could induce us to a representation which we know must give you concern.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:018259_0045_0FA5BDFAF42F19B0"/>
Your Excellency has so intimate a knowledge of the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the army, as to render a particular delineation unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. As you have been a witness of our sufferings during a war uncommon in its nature, and unparalleled in many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances attending it, so you are now, Sir, no less a witness of the unequal burthen which has fallen upon us, from the want of that provision, to which, from our assiduous and unremitting services, we conceive, we are entitled. Having recently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed our sense of what was due to our distress—having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated from your Excellency the confidence we had, that our accompts would be liquidated, the balances ascertained, and adequate funds provided for payment, previous to our being dispersed or disbanded—having seen, with pleasure, the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation which Congress gave our reliance—it is with a mixture of astonishment and chagrin, that we view the late resolve of Congress, by which the soldiers for the war, and a proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate number of officers, are to be furloughed without any one of those important objects being accomplished; and, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the scene of woe, are to be compelled to leave the army without the means of defraying the debts we have necessarily incurred in the course of service, or even of gratifying those menials, in the pittance which is their due; much less, to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry with us that support and comfort to our families, of which, from our long military services they have been deprived. No less exposed then, to the insults of the meanest followers of the army, than to the arrests of the sheriff; deprived of the ability to assist our families; and without an evidence that any thing is due to us for our services; and, consequently, without the least prospect of obtaining credit for even a temporary subsist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence until we can get into business—to what quarter can we look? We take the liberty to say, Sir, only to your Excellency. And from the sincerity of our hearts, we do it, no less from a persuasion of the efficiency of your further efforts in our favor, than from the kind assurances you have been pleased to give us of your support.</p>
               <p>To your Excellency then we make our appeal, and in the most solemn manner, from that abhorrence of oppression and injus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice which first unsheathed our swords, from the remembrance of the common dangers through which we have passed; and from the recollection of those astonishing events which have been effected by our united efforts, permit us to solicit your further aid; and to entreat, that the order of the 2d instant, founded on the act of Congress of the 26th of May last, may be suspended or varied in its operation, so far, as that no officers or soldier be obliged to receive a furlough, until that honorable
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018259_0046_0FA5BDFB2EA5F4A0"/>
body can be apprised of the wretched situation into which the army must be plunged, by a conformity to it; that your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency will endeavour to prevail on Congress—nay, that, on the principles of common justice, you will insist that neither officer nor soldier be compelled to leave the field, until a liqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of accompts can be effected, till the balances are ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, certificates for the sums due given, including the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of half-pay to the officers, and the gratuity of eighty dollars to the soldiers, and till a supply of money can be furnish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sufficient to carry us from the field of glory, with honor to ourselves and credit to our country. We still wish to believe, that that country, to which we have been so long devoted, will never look with indifference on the distresses of those of her sons who have so essentially contributed to the establishment of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the security of property, and the rearing of an empire.</p>

               <p>BEFORE I make a reply to the subject of the address of the Generals and officers commanding the regiments and corps of this army, presented by yourself yesterday, I entreat that those gentlemen will accept my warmest acknowledgment for the confidence they have been pleased to repose in me; they may be assured it shall never be abused; and I beg they will be persuaded, that as no man can possibly be better acquainted than I am with the past merits and services of the army, so no one can possibly be more strongly impressed with their present ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible situation, feel a keener sensibility at their distresses, or more ardently desire to alleviate or remove them,—but it would be unnecessary perhaps, to enter into a detail of what I have done, and what I am still attempting to do, in order to assist in the accomplishment of this interesting purpose,—let it be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to observe, I do not yet despair of success; for I am perfectly convinced that the States cannot, without involving themselves in national bankruptcy and ruin, refuse to comply with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisitions of Congress: Who, it must be acknowledged, have
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018259_0047_0FA5BDFCCAA04E70"/>
done every thing in their power to obtain ample and compleat justice for the army, and whose great object in the present mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure undoubtedly was, by a reduction of expence to enable the Financier to make the three months payment to the army, which on all hands has been agreed to be absolutely and indis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensibly necessary: To explain this matter, I beg leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert an extract of a letter from the Superintendant of Finance, dated the 29th ultimo.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>It is now above a month since the Committee conferred with me on that subject, and I then told them no payment could be made to the army, but by means of a paper anticipation; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less our expenditures were immediately and considerably reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even that could not be done. Our expenditures have never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless been continued, and our revenues lessen; the states growing daily more and more remiss in their collections. The consequence is that I cannot make payment in the manner first intended: The notes issued for this purpose would have been payable at two, four and six months from the date, but at present they will be at six months, and even that will soon become impracticable, unless our expences be immediately curtailed.</p>
                  <p>I shall cause such notes to be issued for three months pay to the army, and I must intreat, Sir, that every influence be used with the States to absorb them together with my other en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements by taxation.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Three days ago a messenger was despatched by me to urge the necessity of forwarding these notes with the greatest possible expedition.</p>
               <p>Under this state of circumstances, I need scarcely add that the expence of every day in feeding the whole army, will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease very considerably, the inability of the public to discharge the debts already incurred, at least for a considerable time to come.</p>
               <p>Although the officers of the army very well know my official situation, that I am only a servant of the public, and that it is not for me to dispense with orders, which it is my duty to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into execution,—yet as furloughs in all services are consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a matter of indulgence and not of compulsion; as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, I am persuaded, entertain the best disposition toward the army, and as I apprehend, in a very short time, the two prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal articles of complaint will be removed;—until the further pleasure of Congress can be known, I shall not hesitate to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the wishes of the army, under these reservations only, that officers sufficient to conduct the men who choose to receive furloughs, will attend them either on furlough or by detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the propriety and necessity of this measure must be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:018259_0048_0FA5BDFD5084BAB0"/>
to all, it need not therefore be inforced; and with regard to the non-commissioned officers and privates, such as from a peculiarity of circumstances, wish not to receive furloughs at this time, will give in their names by twelve o'clock to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the commanding officers of their regiments, that on a report to the Adjutant-General, an equal number of men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged for three years may be furloughed, which will make the saving of expences exactly the same to the public.</p>
               <p>I cannot but hope the notes will soon arrive, and that the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of accompts may be compleated by the assistance of the Pay-masters, in a very few days. In the mean time I shall have the honor of laying the sentiments of the Generals and officers commanding regiments and corps, before Congress—they are expressed in such a decent, candid and affecting manner, that I am certain every mark of attention will be paid to them.</p>
               <closer>
                  <signed>I have the honor to be, with very great esteem,
Sir, your most obedient servant, Major-General HEATH.</signed>

               <p>I HAVE the honor to enclose to your Excellency, the copy of an address to me, from the Generals and officers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding regiments and corps, together with my answer to it. These enclosures will explain the distresses which resulted from the measures now carrying into execution in consequence of the resolution of the 26th of May, but the sensibility occasioned by a parting scene, under such peculiar circumstances, will not admit of description.</p>
               <p>The two subjects of complaint with the army appear to be, the delay of the three months payment which had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and the want of a settlement of accounts—I have tho't myself authorised to assure them, Congress had and would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend particularly to their grievances; and have made some lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle variations respecting furloughs, from what was at first pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed:—The Secretary at War will be able to explain the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son and propriety of this alteration.</p>
               <p>While I consider it a tribute of justice on this occasion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the temperate and orderly behaviour of the whole army, and particularly the accommodating spirit of the officers in ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranging themselves to the command of the battalions which will be composed of the three year's men; permit me to recal to mind all their former sufferings and merits, and to recommend their reasonable requests to the early and favourable notice of Congress. I have the honor to be, .</p>
