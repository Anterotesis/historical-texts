            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE ANNIVERSARY of a DAY, which ush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered into being the INDEPENDENCE of a powerful nation, must ever be held in religious remembrance by those who participate its blessings. Gratitude, the first of virtues, however discarded by the policy of courts, has ever found a hospitable reception in the republican
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:028166_0003_0FD728C0C4F13688"/>
bosom. Influenced by the divine principle, WE are assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled my FELLOW CITIZENS to commemorate the era of our political salvation. An event, which to AMERICA at the same time united the pitiful period of royalty with the epoch of national dignity. An event, which shall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the admiration of distant ages, and challenge oblivion itself to wipe from the page of fame.</p>
            <p>THE history of this Western World affords some of the most surprising phaenomena which have ever aston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished mankind. Its discovery arose from the most noble spirit of enterprize and its settlement from the most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severing fortitude that ever incited the human breast. It would be an outrage on your patience to rehearse the oft recounted toils which were the lot of our forefathers; WE have all been told and WE have all read, the gradual culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the wilderness and the advancement of the Arts and Sciences. Let us hasten then to the vicinity of that important moment, which roused into exertion the latent spirit and finally sealed the happiness of our country.</p>
            <p>THE subjects of AMERICA by their industry and economy, were rising into all the consequence which the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028166_0004_0FD728C20889F960"/>
circumscribed condition of dependant colonies could ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Faithful to the servile allegiance, which superior power prescribed, and to which their feeble situation oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to assent, they were devotedly attentive to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of their mother country. Submission to her commands was a deep rooted idea in the prejudices of the old, and inculcated in the infant mind, as the first of polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical maxims, and the test of a religious creed. The mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itary force of the country, if such it might be termed, was but partially equipped, and totally undisciplined. Thus depressed and enervated, the watchful eye of Britan beheld us and to debase our already degraded situation, exerted the last effort of despotism. To pamper her venal pride, additional burthens were imposed on our weary backs; and the cup of misery was replenished with more bitter po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Petitions, framed in the humble style of beggary and distress, were presented with a trembling hand at the footstool of the throne. Unavailing were the prayers, and neglected were the remonstrances, of this injured people. Here, the dormant spirit of AMERICANS awoke into energy, the down cast eye of submission sparkled with animation, and the timid features of debasement

               </gap> to the daring front of resolution. To the sword was assigned the argument, and to heaven was left the decision, of the important contest. At the crisis, when even the most veteran advocates of FREEDOM trembled at the event, the immortal declaration of our INDEPENDENCE was trumpeted to the world. To carry this claim into effect, the military force of the country was summoned to action: Unequal had been the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and doubtful indeed the decision, had not our gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous allies extended the friendly arm. By the assistance of France, our haughty foes soon found an equality at sea and a decided superiority on land. The same mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, however, which deluded them in the attempt, infatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated them in the hope, of success. So long had AMERICA been considered as the puny dupe of power, and so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible in the eyes of Britain was held the prowess of gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic arms, that an insulting defiance was bid to our united efforts. The melancholy scene of carnage ensued, and all the complicated horrors of war burst on our devoted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The flames, that wrapt our villages, the currents of blood, that empurpled our plains, the anguish of the hapless widow, and the artless tears of the friendless orphan

personified misery in its most haggard form.—Here should WE pause! And, while grateful memory still cherishes the idea of martyred patriots, while pensive contemplation assures us the blessings WE enjoy, flowed from the veins of departed heroes, let us swear an eternal remembrance of their virtues. Let not their children search in vain for the marble sculpture, which records the fame of their fathers. And if to etherial inhabitants be exposed the view of this lower world, may their bending glances catch the towering monuments of their glory. Various were the successes, and various the defeats, which cheequer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the prospect. At length, the decisive die was cast; and Britain, after seven years opposition to the decrees of heaven, after having impoverished her treasures, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected her subjects, with a reluctant hand subscribed our INDEPENDENCE.</p>
            <p>To regulate the economy of government, now required the collective wisdom of the nation. As yet, intoxicated with the novel draughts of LIBERTY, and strangers to the practice of our established theory, a continuation of that confederacy, which had united us in the perils of war, was
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028166_0007_0FD728CA5E656710"/>
adopted, as an experiment in the security of peace. But experience soon taught that a government of more energy was necessary, and the FEDERAL CONSTITUTION, under which we now so happily exist, received the sanction of the people.</p>
            <p>THUS have we been conducted through scenes of peril, to a situation, which commands the envy of every nation on the globe. INDEPENDENCE has brought in her train to this happy clime, every blessings, which can add a charm to society. With a government, which for the political wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom it exhibits, has commanded universal admiration, the rights of each individual are equally secured. Merit is the only avenue to distinction, and the offices of government are ever at the disposal of the great body of the people. The impartiality of our laws, which with the same watchful eye protect the pittance of the beggar, and the treasures of the opulent, affords sufficient inducement to the acquisition of property.</p>
            <p>THE military force of the country has acquired a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectability, which it never before attained, and which will be a sufficient safeguard against the encroachments of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028166_0008_0FD728CC835FF7C8"/>
any hostile power. At the head of this government, is a MAN, in whom are happily blended those talents, which have alike immortalized his name in the cabinet and the field. Long may he continue to enjoy the united affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his country—May that period be yet far distant, that shall rob the world of its ORNAMENT, and AMERICA of its SAVIOUR.</p>
            <p>To the INDEPENDENCE of this country, in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, may be attributed the noble exertions of our friends the French. That nation had for ages been galled with the yoke of servitude, and sunk in the depths of ignorance. The despotism of the court, and the power, united with the bigotry, of the priests gave birth to every species of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and cruelty, that could disgrace humanity. From AMERICA they caught the animating ray of FREEDOM, and with divine enthusiasm furled her sacred standard. The world has witnessed, and humanity has lamented the excesses of France. But, is not a temporary delirium to be expected, when twenty four millions of people emerge from the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night gloom of slavery, and meet the noontide beams of LIB<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ERTY? Shall the rigid rules of prudence, in this distracted
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028166_0009_0FD728D2492A15A8"/>
hour exact a scrupulous conformity to her laws? Shall not justice herself relax her iron brows, and give to madness a momentary jubilee? Far be it from us, to countenance deliberate acts of wanton cruelty; but let France be weighed in the equal scales of impartiality, and her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniators, <hi>even in this country,</hi> shall blush at the balance. To what temptations have they not been exposed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on their internal enemies the depredations of a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign hord of DESPOTS.—The monarchs of Europe, trembled at the consequence of Gallic Liberty.—The tottering pillars of their own thrones were the monitors, which urged them to this war of principles. As yet, the arms of France have carried with them the victorious trophies of brilliant success. May the GOD of Heaven speed their glorious career, till the TEMPLE OF LIBERTY SHALL BE ERECTED ON TOMB STONE OF TYRANTS.</p>
            <p>WHILE the nations of the elder world are combating the tempests, and suffering the devastations of war, AMERICA reposes on the tranquil bosom of peace. While famine and the sword are desolating Europe, this is the land of plenty and of happiness. To secure the blessings WE
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028166_0010_0FD728D404984118"/>
now enjoy, and to remain the most envied nation on earth, is a task by no means difficult. The citizens of this country are sufficiently enlightened, to preserve their rights in native purity. A general diffusion of knowledge is the greatest security to the existence of a nation. Let the doors of instruction, therefore, be widely opened to the rising generation. Teach them the genuine principles of patriotism, which inspired their fathers, and they, in return, shall hand the hallowed lesson to latest posterity. Ere long the system, which we have established, so far from appearing visionary, will bear "conviction strong." The light of reason is illuminat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the world, and the relicks of monarchy are on the last wave of fortune's ebbing tide. Already, in the language of Shakespeare.
