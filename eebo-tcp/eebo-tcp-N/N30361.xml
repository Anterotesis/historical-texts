            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <dateline>Memorandum <date>
                     <hi>March</hi> 27th 1744.</date>
               </dateline>
            </opener>
            <p>THIS Day about 10 o'Clock in the Forenoon, Mr. <hi>Luke Brown,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Keeper of the Goal in <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter,</hi> informed me the Subſcriber one of His Majeſty's Juſtices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> that he had been read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſundry Paſſages of holy Writ to <hi>Edward Fitz Partrick</hi> relating to Murder; and after ſome Diſcourſe thereon, (as <hi>Brown</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me) <hi>Fitz Partrick</hi> told him if Mr. <hi>Burr</hi> and myſelf would come to the Goal, he would confeſs the whole Truth (relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Murder;) accordingly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween one &amp; two o'Clock in the Afternoon we went to him, <hi>Brown</hi> being preſent. <hi>Fitz Partrick,</hi> confeſs'd himſelf to be guilty of willfully murdering ſaid <hi>Campbell,</hi> by throwing him down, and ſtrangling him; and in the Fray <hi>Campbell</hi> bit the middle Finger of his right Hand (which now had the Wounds on it) which bled, and with which it was that he blooded his Cloaths with, that he ſaid <hi>Partrick</hi> had on when the Murder was done, (the Cloaths being now in my Poſſeſſion, and the Jacket bloody.)</p>
            <p>I then aſk'd him if <hi>Campbell</hi> did not bleed? he anſwered, no, he ſtrangled him and did not ſtrike him to make him bleed.</p>
            <p>This Murder was committed the Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Night before the dead Body of <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> was found, being the 8th inſtant.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fitz Partrick</hi> further declared that the Evening before the Murder was done, <hi>Campbell</hi> and he had been to <hi>William Whitaker</hi>'s, and the ſaid <hi>Partrick</hi> came home firſt and went to the Barn, and when <hi>Campbell</hi> came home, he told him the Cattle were looſe in the Barn; this he did to get him out, and they both ran to the Barn together, where he did the Murder in the Manner aforeſaid: After which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd the dead Body to the Place where it was bury'd, that he dug the Grave with the Spade found in the Houſe, and on Saturday Morning he covered the Grave with Loggs, that he cut off ſome Buttons of <hi>Campbell's</hi> Jacket, and deſign'd them for his own Breeches (which Buttons I now have by me) that ſome Muſlin ſince found in his Pocket, he took out of <hi>Campbell's</hi> Cheſt ſome Time after the Murder.</p>
            <p>He alſo own'd, he took a Snuff Box out of ſaid Cheſt, hung &amp; tipt with Silver, with ſomething in it; as alſo another Box; and as he was opening one of 'em atone <hi>Lamond</hi>'s Houſe in <hi>Rutland,</hi> ſomething fell out of the Box, &amp; he had not Time to look for it, nor did he know what it was; that he hid the Box hung and tipt with Silver by a Stump near <hi>Campbell</hi>'s Houſe in the Road; that he hid a Box called a Cannoe Box of <hi>Campbell</hi>'s in the Wall near ſaid <hi>Lamond's</hi> Houſe; that he hid a pair of Shoes of <hi>Campbell</hi>'s in a Heap of Stones near the Barn with the Soles upward, and a ſlat Stone laid over them. A pair of Silver Shoe-Buckles of <hi>Campbell</hi>'s he hid under a Log between the Houſe and Barn.</p>
            <p>He acknowledged his Inducement to kill him, was to get his Things, and that he alone did the Murder, and no other Perſon was concerned with him. He further added, That in the ſcuffle <hi>Campbell</hi> ſtruck him a ſevere Blow with his Foot on his right Breaſt, that almoſt took his Life a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, but recovering, he ſoon diſpatch'd him. The Mark on his Breaſt where he was hurt he ſhew'd us.</p>
            <p>I aſk'd him if he had any angry Words, or had differed with <hi>Campbell:</hi> he ſaid, that ſome little Time before he had bro't home ſome Rum and ſold Part of it to him, and that he thought <hi>Campbell</hi> had not done him Juſtice; that he was a little dirty naſtly Fellow, and he did not like him: He told us, that he was ſo troubled he could not ſleep, the Night the Murder was committed, nor the Night after but a little.</p>
            <p>The aforewritten Confeſſion, <hi>Edward Fitz-Patrick</hi> acknowledged freely before the Reverend Mr. <hi>Burr, Luke Brown,</hi> and my ſelf, the Day firſt written.</p>
