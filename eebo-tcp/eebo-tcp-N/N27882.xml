            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE TWO SHOEMAKERS.</head>
            <p>THE tricks were ſo merry that the time ſeemed ſhort, and when they were over he could not forbear going into the Globe and treating theſe choice ſpirits with a bowl of punch. Juſt as they were taking the laſt glaſs, Jack happened to ſay that he was the beſt fives player in the country. "That is lucky," ſaid the Andrew, "for there is a famous match now playing in the court, and you may never have ſuch an opportunity to ſhow your ſkill." Brown declared he could not ſtay, for that he had left his horſe at the Star, and muſt ſet off on urgent buſineſs. They now all pretended to call his ſkill in queſtion. This rouſed his pride, and he thought another half hour could break no ſquares. Smiler had now had a good feed of corn, and he would only
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:037147_0003_100C957902457390"/>have to puſh her a little more; ſo to it he went.</p>
            <p>He won the firſt game. This ſpurred him on: and he played till it was ſo dark they could not ſee a ball. Another bowl was called for from the winner. Wagers and betts now drained Brown not only of all the money he had won, but of all he had in his pocket, ſo that he was obliged to aſk leave to go to the houſe where his horſe was, to borrow enough to diſcharge his reckoning at the Globe.</p>
            <p>All theſe loſſes brought his poor dear mother to his mind, and he marched off with rather a heavy heart, to borrow the money, and to order Smiler out of the ſtable. The landlord expreſſed much ſurpriſe at ſeeing him, and the oſtler de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared there was no Smiler there; that ſhe had been rode off above two hours ago by the Merry Andrew, who ſaid he came by order of the owner Mr. Brown to fetch her to the Globe, and to pay for her feed. It was indeed one of the neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt tricks the Andrew ever performed,
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:037147_0004_100C957A8F4CFA18"/>for he had made ſuch a clean conveyance of Smiler, that neither Jack nor his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ever heard of her again.</p>
            <p>It was night. No one could tell what road the Andrew took, and it was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hour or two before an advertiſement could be drawn up for apprehending the horſe-ſtealer. Jack had ſome doubts whether he ſhould go on or return back. He knew that though his father might fear his wife moſt, yet he loved Smiler beſt. At length he took that courage from a glaſs of brandy which he ought to have taken from a hearty repentance, and he reſolved to purſue his journey. He was obliged to leave his watch and ſilver buckles in pawn for a little old hack which was nothing but ſkin and bone, and would hardly trot three miles an hour.</p>
            <p>He knocked at his father's door about five in the morning. The family were all up. He aſked the boy who opened the door how his mother was? "She is dead," ſaid the boy, "ſhe died yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:037147_0005_100C957C1B3FC4E0"/>afternoon." Here Jack's heart ſmote him, and he cried aloud, partly from grief, but more from the reproaches of his own conſcience, for he found by computing the hours, that had he come ſtrait on, he ſhould have been in time to have received his mother's bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The Farmer now called from within. "I hear Smiler's ſtep. Is Jack come?" "Yes father," ſaid Jack in a low voice. "Then," cried the Farmer, "run every man and boy of you and take care of the mare. Tom, do thou go and rub her down; Jem, run and get her a good feed of corn. Be ſure and walk her about that ſhe may not catch cold." Young Brown came in. "Are you not an undutiful dog?" ſaid the father, "you might have been here twelve hours ago. Your mother could not die in peace with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing you. She ſaid it was a cruel return for all her fondneſs that you could not make a little haſte to ſee her; but it was always ſo, for ſhe wronged her other children to help you, and this was her reward." Brown ſobbed out a few
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:037147_0006_100C957E9AEB6B20"/>words, but his father replied, "Never cry Jack, for the boy told me that it was out of regard for Smiler that you were not here as ſoon as he was; and if it was your over care of her, why there's no great harm done. You could not have ſaved your poor mother, and you might have hurt the mare." Here Jack's double guilt flew into his face. He knew that his father was very covetous, and had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on bad terms with his wife; and alſo that his own unkindneſs to her had been forgiven out of love to the horſe; but to break to him how he had loſt that horſe through his own folly and want of feeling was more than Jack had courage to do. The old man however, ſoon got at the truth, and no words can deſcribe his fury. Forgetting that his wife lay dead above ſtairs, he abuſed his ſon in a way not fit to be repeated; and though his covetouſneſs had juſt before found an excuſe for neglecting to viſit a dying parent, yet he now vented his rage a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Jack as an unnatural brute, whom he would cut off with a ſhilling, and bade him never ſee his face again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:037147_0007_100C9580F27655C0"/>Jack was not allowed to attend his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's funeral which was a real grief to him; nor would his father advance even the little money which was needful to redeem his things at the Star. He had now no fond mother to aſſiſt him, and he ſet out on his return home on his borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hack full of grief. He knew he had alſo loſt a little hoard of money which his mother had ſaved up for him.</p>
            <p>When Brown got back to his own town he found that the ſtory of Smiler and the Andrew had got thither before him, and it was thought a very good joke at the Greyhound. He ſoon recovered his ſpirits as far as related to the horſe, but as to his behaviour to his dying mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it troubled him at times to the laſt day of his life, though he did all he could to forget it. He did not however go on at all better, nor did he engage in one fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic the leſs for what paſſed at the Globe.</p>
            <p>Jack began at length to feel the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of that proverb, "Keep your ſhop and your ſhop will keep you." He had
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:037147_0008_100C9582830408A0"/>neglected his cuſtomers, and they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook him. Quarter day came round; there was much to pay and little to receive. He owed two years rent. He was in arrears to his men for wages. He had a long account with his currier. It was in vain to apply to his father. He had now no mother. Stock was the only true friend he had in the world, and had helped him out of many petty ſcrapes, but he knew Stock would advance no money in ſo hopeleſs a caſe. Duns came faſt about him. He named a ſpeedy day for payment, but as ſoon as they were out of the houſe, and the danger put off to a little diſtance, he forgot every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, was as merry as ever, and run the ſame round of thoughtleſs gaiety. Whenever he was in trouble Stock did not ſhun him, becauſe that was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he thought to throw in a little good advice. He one day aſked him if he always intended to go on in this courſe? "No," ſaid he, "I am reſolved bye-and-by to reform, grow ſober, and go to church. Why I am but five and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, man, I am ſtrong and healthy, and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:037147_0009_100C95846FA69FA8"/>likely to live long, I can repent and grow melancholy and good at any time."</p>
            <p>"Oh Jack," ſaid Stock, don't cheat thyſelf with that falſe hope. What thou doſt intend to do, do quickly. Didſt thou never hear about the heart growing hardened by long indulgence in ſin? Some folk, who pretend to mean well, ſhow that they mean nothing at all, by never beginning to put their good reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions into practice; which made a wiſe man once ſay, that "hell is paved with good intentions."</p>
            <p>Michaelmas Day was at hand. The Landlord declared he would be put off no longer, but would ſeize for rent if it was not paid him on that day, as well as for a conſiderable ſum due to him for leather. Brown now began to be frightened. He applied to Stock to be bound for him. This Stock flatly refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Brown now began to dread the horrors of a jail, and really ſeemed ſo ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contrite, and made ſo many vows and promiſes of amendment, that at length
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:037147_0010_100C9586F9C955C0"/>Stock was prevailed on, together with two or three of Brown's other friends, to advance each a ſmall ſum of money to quiet the Landlord, Brown promiſing to make over to them every part of his ſtock, and to be guided in future by their advice, that he would turn over a new leaf, and follow Mr. Stock's example, as well as his directions in every thing.</p>
            <p>Stock's good-nature was at laſt wrought upon, and he raiſed the money. The truth is, he did not know the worſt, or how deeply Brown was involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Brown joyfully ſet out at the very quarter day to a town at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to carry his Landlord the money raiſed by the imprudent kindneſs of his friend. At his departure Stock put him in mind of the old ſtory of Smiler and the Merry Andrew, and he promiſed of his own head that he would not even call at a public houſe till he had paid the money.</p>
            <p>He was as good as his word. He ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry triumphantly paſſed by ſeveral. He
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:037147_0011_100C9588EDA62C28"/>ſtopped a little under the window of one where the ſounds of merriment and loud laughter caught his ear. At another he he heard the enticing notes of a fiddle and the light heels of the merry dancers. Here his heart had well nigh failed him, but the dread of a jail on the one hand, and what he feared almoſt as much, Mr. Stock's anger on the other, ſpurred him on; and he valued himſelf not a little at having got the better of this temptation. He felt quite happy when he found he had reached the door of his landlord without having yielded to one idle incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
            <p>He knocked at the door. The maid who opened it ſaid her maſter was not at home. "I am ſorry for it," ſaid he ſtrut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting about, and with a boaſting air took out his money. "I want to pay him my rent: he need not have been afraid of me." The ſervant, who knew her maſter was very much afraid of him, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to walk in, her maſter would be at home in half an hour. "I will call again," ſaid he: "but no, let him
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:037147_0012_100C958A7916EDE0"/>call on me, and the ſooner the better: I ſhall be at the Blue Poſt." While he had been talking he took care to open his black leather caſe, and to diſplay the Bank Bills to the ſervant, and then, in a ſwaggering way, he put up his money and marched off to the Blue Poſts.</p>
            <p>He was by this time quite proud of his own reſolutions, and having tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the money, and being clear in his own mind that it was the landlord's own fault that it was not paid, he went to refreſh himſelf at the Blue Poſts. In a barn be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to this public houſe ſome ſtrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers were juſt going to perform ſome of that ſing-ſong ribaldry with which our villages are corrupted, the laws broken, and that money is drawn from the poor for pleaſure, which is wanted by their families for bread. The name of the laſt new ſong which made part of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, made him think himſelf in high luck, that he ſhould have juſt that half hour to ſpare. He went into the barn, but was too much delighted with the actor who ſung his favourable ſong to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:037147_0013_100C958C0A5946D8"/>remain a quiet hearer. He leaped out of the pit, and got behind the two rag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged blankets which ſerved for a curtain. He ſung ſo much better than the actors themſelves, that they praiſed and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red him to a degree which awakened all his vanity. He was ſo intoxicated with their flattery, that he could do no leſs than invite them all to ſupper, an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation which they were too hungry not to accept.</p>
            <p>He did not however quite forget his appointment with his landlord; but the half hour was long ſince paſt by. "And ſo," ſays he, "as I know he is a mean curmudgeon, who goes to bed I ſuppoſe by day light to ſave candle, it will be too late to ſpeak with him to night—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, let him call upon me: it is his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and not mine. I left word where I was to be found, the money is ready, and if I don't pay him to-night, I can do it before breakfaſt."</p>
            <p>By the time theſe firm reſolutions were made ſupper was ready. There never
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:037147_0014_100C958E508E76E0"/>was a more jolly evening. Ale and punch were as plenty as water. The actors ſaw what a vain fellow was feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them; and as they wanted victuals, and he wanted flattery, the buſineſs was ſoon ſettled. They ate and Brown ſung. They pretended to be in raptures. Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing promoted drinking, and every freſh glaſs produced a ſong, or a ſtory ſtill more merry than the former. Before morning thoſe who were engaged to act in another barn a dozen miles off ſtole away quietly. Brown having dropt aſleep they left him to finiſh his nap by himſelf: as to him, his dreams were gay and pleaſant, and the houſe being quite ſtill, he ſlept comfortably till morning.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as he had breakfaſted, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the night before popped into his head. He ſet off once more to his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord's in high ſpirits, gaily ſinging all the way ſcraps of all the tunes he had picked up the night before from his new friends. The landlord opened the door himſelf, and reproached him with no ſmall ſurli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for not having kept his word with
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:037147_0015_100C9590438AF3B0"/>him the evening before, adding, that he ſuppoſed he was now come with ſome more of his ſhallow excuſes. Brown put on all that haughtineſs which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to people who are generally in the wrong, when they catch themſelves do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right action, and looked big, as ſome ſort of people do, when they have money to pay. "You need not have been ſo anxious about your money," ſaid he, "I was not going to break or run away." The Landlord knew this was the common language of thoſe who were ready to do both. Brown haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly added,—"You ſhall ſee I am a man of my word; give me a receipt." The Landlord had it ready and gave it him.</p>
            <p>Brown put his hand in his pocket for his black leather caſe where the bills were, he felt, he ſearched, he examined, firſt one pocket, then the other, then both waiſtcoat pockets, but no leather caſe could he find. He looked terrified. It was the face of real terror. The land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord conceived it to be that of guilt, and abuſed him heartily for putting his old
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:037147_0016_100C95929377E300"/>tricks upon him; he ſwore he would not be impoſed upon any longer, the money or a jail, there lay his choice.</p>
            <p>Brown proteſted for once with great truth, that he had no intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; that he had actually brought the money, and knew not what was become of it; but the thing was far too unlikely to gain credit. Brown now called to mind that he had fallen aſleep on the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the room where they had ſupped. This raiſed his ſpirits. He had no doubt but the caſe had fallen out of his pocket, ſaid he would ſtep to the public-houſe and ſearch for it, and would be back di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly. Not one word of all this did the landlord believe, ſo inconvenient is it to have a bad character. He ſwore Brown ſhould not ſtir out of his houſe without a conſtable, and made him wait while he ſent for one. Brown, guarded by the conſtable, went back to the Blue Poſts. The landlord charging the officer not to loſe ſight of the culprit. The caution was needleſs, Brown had not the leaſt deſign of running away, ſo firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:037147_0017_100C95941EEA6DC0"/>was he that he ſhould find his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther caſe.</p>
            <p>But who can paint his diſmay, when no tale or tidings of the leather caſe could be had. The maſter, the miſtreſs, the boy, and the maid of the public houſe all proteſted they were innocent. His ſuſpicions ſoon fell on the ſtrollers with whom he had paſſed the night. And he now found out for the firſt time that a merry evening did not always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a happy morning. He obtained a warrant, and proper officers were ſent in purſuit of the ſtrollers. No one how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believed he had loſt any thing. And as he had not a ſhilling left to defray the expenſive treat he had given, the maſter of the inn agreed with the other landlord in thinking this ſtory was a trick to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud both. Brown remained in cloſe cuſtody. At length the officers returned, who ſaid they had been obliged to let the ſtrollers go, as they could not fix the charge on any one, and they had all offered to ſwear before a juſtice that they had ſeen nothing of the leather caſe.
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:037147_0018_100C9595D4604730"/>And it was agreed that as he had paſſed the evening in a crowded barn, he had probably been robbed there of it all; and among ſo many who could pretend to gueſs at the thief?</p>
            <p>Brown raved like a madman, he cried and tore his hair, ſaid he was ruined for ever. The abuſive language of his old landlord, and his new creditor at the Blue Poſts, did not lighten his ſorrow. His landlord would be put off no longer. Brown declared he could neither find bail nor raiſe another ſhilling, and as ſoon as the forms of law were made out, he was ſent to the county jail.</p>
            <p>Here it might have been expected that hard living and much leiſure would have brought him to reflect a little on his paſt follies. But his heart was not truly touched. The chief thing which griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him at firſt was, his having abuſed the kindneſs of Stock, for to him he ſhould appear guilty of a real fraud, where he had indeed been only vain, idle, and imprudent. And it is worth while
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:037147_0019_100C9598CA530160"/>here to remark that vanity, idleneſs, and imprudence, often bring a man to ruin both ſoul and body, though ſilly peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple do not put them in the catalogue of heavy ſins, and thoſe who indulge them are often reckoned good honeſt merry fellows.</p>
            <p>Brown was no ſooner lodged in his doleful habitation, and a little recovered from his firſt ſurpriſe, than he ſat down and wrote his friend Stock the whole hiſtory of the tranſaction. Mr. Stock, who had long known the exceeding light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſſipation of his mind, did not ſo utterly diſbelieve the ſtory as all the other creditors did. To ſpeak the truth, Stock was the only one among them who had good ſenſe enough to know, that a man may be completely ruined, both in what relates to his prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and his ſoul, without committing Old Bailey crimes. He knew that idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, vanity, and the love of <hi>pleasure,</hi> as it is falſely called, will bring a man to a morſel of bread, as ſurely as thoſe things which are reckoned much greater
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:037147_0020_100C959AB68438F8"/>ſins; and that they undermine his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as certainly, though not perhaps quite ſo faſt.</p>
            <p>Stock was too angry with what had happened to anſwer Brown's letter, or to ſeem to take the leaſt notice of him. However, he kindly and ſecretly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took a journey to the hard hearted old Farmer, Brown's father, to intercede with him, and to ſee if he would do any thing for his ſon. Stock did not pretend to excuſe Jack, or even to leſſen his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences; for it was a rule of his never to diſguiſe truth or to palliate wickedneſs. Sin was ſtill ſin in his eyes, though it were committed by his beſt friend; but though he would not ſoften the ſin he felt tenderly for the ſinner. He plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the old Farmer on the ground that his ſon's idleneſs and other vices would gather freſh ſtrength in a jail. He told him that the looſe and worthleſs company which he would there keep, would harden him in vice, and if he was now wicked he might there become irreclaimable.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:037147_0021_100C959C48671B98"/>But all his pleas were urged in vain. The farmer was not to be moved. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he argued with ſome juſtice, that he ought not to make his induſtrious children beggars to ſave one rogue from the gallows. Mr. Stock allowed the force of this reaſon, though he ſaw the father was leſs influenced by this prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of juſtice than by reſentment on account of the old Story of Smiler.</p>
            <p>Mr. Stock at length wrote to poor Jack; not to offer him any help, that was quite out of the queſtion, but "to exhort him to repent of his evil ways; to lay before him the ſins of his paſt life, and to adviſe him to convert the preſent puniſhment into a benefit, by humbling himſelf before God."</p>
            <p>If Mr. Stock had ſent him a good ſum of money to procure his liberty, or even a trifle to make merry with his wretched companions, Jack would have thought him a friend indeed. But to ſend him nothing but dry advice, and a few words of empty comfort, was, he thought, but
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:037147_0022_100C959ED18A2490"/>a cheap ſhabby way of ſhewing his kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Unluckily the letter came juſt as he was going to ſit down to one of thoſe direful merry-makings which are often carried on with brutal riot within the doleful walls of a jail on the entrance of a new priſoner, who is often expected to give a feaſt to the reſt.</p>
            <p>When his companions were heated with gin, "Now" ſays Jack, "I'll treat you with a ſermon, and a very pretty preachment it is." So ſaying he took out Mr. Stock's kind and pious letter, and was delighted at the burſts of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it produced. "What a canting dog!" ſaid one. "Repentance indeed!" cried Tom Crew, "No, no, Jack, tell this hypocritical rogue that if we have loſt our liberty, it is only for having been jolly, hearty fellows, and we have more ſpirit than to repent of that I hope: all the harm we have done is living a little too faſt, like honeſt bucks as we are." Aye, aye, ſaid Jolly George, "had we been ſuch ſneaking miſerly fellows as Stock, we need not have come hither.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:037147_0023_100C95A163A6A1F8"/>But if the ill-nature of the laws has clapped up ſuch fine hearty blades, we are no <hi>felons</hi> however. We are afraid of no Jack Ketch; and I ſee no cauſe to repent of any ſin that's not hanging matter. For thoſe who are thruſt into the condemned hole indeed, and have but a few hours to live, they <hi>must</hi> ſee the Parſon, and hear a ſermon and ſuch ſtuff. But I do not know what ſuch ſtout young fellows as we are have to do with repentance. And ſo Jack, let us have that rare new catch which you learnt of the ſtrollers that merry night when you loſt your pocket book."</p>
            <p>Brown ſpent one part of his time in thoughtleſs riot, and the other in gloom and ſadneſs. Company kept up his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; with his new friends he contrived to drown thought; but when he was alone he began to find that a <hi>merry fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,</hi> when deprived of his companions and his liquor, is often a moſt forlorn wretch. Then it is, that even a merry fellow ſays of laughter, "What is it? and of mirth it is madneſs."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:037147_0024_100C95A2F1B649B0"/>As he contrived, however, to be as little alone as poſſible, his gaiety was commonly uppermoſt, till that loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome diſtemper called the Jail Fever, broke out in the priſon. He ſoon caught the diſtemper, and that in ſo dreadful a degree, that his life was in great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. He lay in the moſt deplorable condition; his body tormented with a dreadful diſeaſe, and his ſoul terrified and amazed at the approach of death; that death, which he thought at ſo great a diſtance, and of which his comrades had aſſured him, that a young fellow of five and twenty was in no danger. Poor Jack! I cannot help feeling for him. Without a ſhilling! without a friend! without one comfort reſpecting this world, and, what is far more terible, without one hope reſpecting the next.</p>
            <p>A Chriſtian friend generally comes forward at the very time when wordly friends forſake the wretched. The other priſoners would not come near Brown, though he had often entertained and never offended them, even his own
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:037147_0025_100C95A525760EB0"/>father was not moved with his ſad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. When Mr. Stock informed him of it, he anſwered, "'tis no more than he deſerves. As he brews ſo he muſt bake. He has made his own bed, and let him lie in it." The hard old man had ever at his tongue's end ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb which he contrived to turn in ſuch a way as to excuſe himſelf.</p>
            <p>We ſhall now ſee how Mr. Stock be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved. He had his favourite ſayings too, but they were chiefly on the ſide of kindneſs, mercy or ſome other virtue. "I muſt not," ſaid he, "pretend to call myſelf a Chriſtian, if I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite evil for good." When he received the jailer's letter with the account of Brown's ſad condition, Will Simpſon and Tommy Williams began to compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment him on his own wiſdom and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by which he had eſcaped Brown's misfortunes. He only gravely ſaid, "Bleſſed be God that I am not in the ſame miſery. It is <hi>He</hi> who has made us to differ. But for <hi>his</hi> grace I might have been in no better condition. Now
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:037147_0026_100C95A769194168"/>Brown is brought low by the hand of God, it is my time to go to him." "What you," ſaid Will, "whom he cheated of your money?" "This is not a time to remember injuries," ſaid Mr. Stock. "How can I aſk forgiveneſs for my own ſins, if I withhold forgiveneſs from him?" So ſaying he ordered his horſe, and ſet off to ſee poor Brown, thus proving that his was a religion not of words but of deeds.</p>
            <p>Stock's heart nearly failed him as he paſſed through the priſon. The groans of the ſick and dying, and what to ſuch a heart as his was ſtill more moving, the brutal merriment of the healthy in ſuch a place, pierced his very ſoul. Many a ſilent prayer did he put as he paſſed along, that GOD would yet be pleaſed to touch their hearts, and that "now (during this infectious ſickneſs) might be the accepted time." The jailor obſerved him drop a tear, and aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the cauſe. "I cannot forget," ſaid he, "that the moſt diſſolute of theſe is ſtill my fellow creature. The ſame GOD
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:037147_0027_100C95AA0EBA8DB8"/>made them; the ſame SAVIOUR died for them, how then can I hate the worſt of them? With my advantages they might have been much better than I am; without the bleſſing of God on my good Miniſter's inſtructions, I might have been worſe than the worſt of theſe. I have no cauſe for pride, much for thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; <hi>let us not be high-minded but fear.</hi>"</p>
            <p>It would have moved a heart of ſtone to have ſeen poor miſerable Jack Brown lying on his wretched bed, his face ſo changed by pain, poverty, dirt and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, that he could hardly be known for that "merry ſoul of a jack boot," as he uſed to be called. His groans were ſo piteous that it made Mr. Stock's heart ach. He kindly took him by the hand, though he knew the diſtemper was catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. "How doſt do Jack?" ſaid he, "doſt know me?" Brown ſhook his head and ſaid faintly, "know you? aye, that I do. I am ſure I have but one friend in the world who would come to ſee me in this woeful condition. O
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:037147_0028_100C95AB99CF3938"/>James! what have I brought myſelf to? What will become of my poor ſoul? I dare not look back, for that is all ſin, nor forwards, for that is all miſery and woe."</p>
            <p>Mr. Stock ſpoke kindly to him, but did not attempt to chear him with falſe comfort, as is too often done. "I am aſhamed to ſee you in this dirty place," ſays Brown. "As to the place Jack," replied the other, "if it has helped to bring you to a ſenſe of your paſt offences, it will be no bad place for you. I am heartily ſorry for your diſtreſs and your ſickneſs; but if it ſhould pleaſe God by them to open your eyes, and to ſhew you that ſin is a greater evil than the priſon to which it has brought you, all may yet be well; I had rather ſee you in this humble penitent ſtate, lying on this dir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty bed, in this diſmal priſon, than roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and rioting at the Greyhound, the king of the company, with handſome cloaths on your back, and plenty of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in your pocket."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:037147_0029_100C95AD278533E8"/>Brown wept bitterly and ſqueezed his hand, but was too weak to ſay much. Mr. Stock then deſired the jailor to let him have ſuch things as were needful and he would pay for them. He would not leave the poor fellow till he had given him with his own hands ſome broth which the jailor had got ready for him, and ſome medicines which the Doctor had ſent. All this kindneſs cut Brown to the heart. He was juſt able to ſob out "my unnatural father leaves me to periſh, and my injured friend is more than a father to me." Stock told him that one proof he muſt give of his repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance was, that he muſt forgive his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, whoſe provocation had been very great. He then ſaid he would leave him for the preſent to take ſome reſt, and deſired him to lift up his heart to God for mercy. "Dear James," replied Brown, "do you pray for me? God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may hear you, but he never will hear the prayer of ſuch a ſinner as I have been." "Take care how you think ſo," ſaid Stock. "To believe that God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not forgive you would be ſtill a greater
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:037147_0030_100C95B0C0A7F418"/>ſin than any you have yet committed againſt him." He then explained to him in a few words, as well as he was able, the nature of repentance, and forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs through a Saviour, and warned him earneſtly againſt unbelief and hardneſs of heart.</p>
            <p>Poor Jack grew much refreſhed in bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with the comfortable things he had taken; and a little cheered with Stock's kindneſs in coming ſo far to ſee, and to forgive ſuch a forlorn outcaſt, ſick of an infectious diſtemper, and locked within the walls of a priſon. "Surely" ſaid he to himſelf, "there muſt be ſome mighty power in a religion which can lead men to do ſuch things! things ſo much againſt the grain as to forgive ſuch an injury, and to riſk catching ſuch a diſtemper," but he was ſo weak he could not expreſs this in words. He tried to pray, but he could not, at length overpowered with wearineſs, he fell faſt aſleep.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Stock came back, he was ſurpriſed to find him ſo much better in
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:037147_0031_100C95B2C1D734E8"/>body; but his agonies of mind were dreadful, and he had now got ſtrength to expreſs part of the horrors which he felt, "James," ſaid he, (looking wildly) "it is all over with me. I am a loſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Even your prayers cannot ſave me." "Dear Jack, replied Mr. Stock I am no miniſter: it does not become me to talk much to thee: but I know I may venture to ſay whatever is in the Bible. As ignorant as I am I ſhall be ſafe enough while I ſtick to that." Aye, ſaid the ſick man, you uſed to be ready enough to read to me, and I would not liſten, or if I did it was only to make fun of what I heard, and now you will not ſo much as read a bit of a chapter to me.</p>
            <p>This was the very point to which Stock longed to bring him. So he took a little bible out of his pocket, which he always carried with him on a journey, and read ſlowly verſe by verſe, the 55th chapter of Iſaiah. When he came to the ſixth and ſeventh verſes, poor Jack cried ſo much that Stock was forced to ſtop. The words were, "Let the wicked man
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:037147_0032_100C839B8605FA18"/>forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord." Here Brown ſtopped him, ſaying, Oh it is too late, too late for me. Let me finiſh the verſe ſaid Stock, and you will ſee your error; you will ſee that it is never too late. So he read on—"let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, and he will abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly pardon." Here Brown ſtarted up, ſnatched the book out of his hand and cried out, Is that really there? No, no; that's of your own putting in, in order to comfort me; let me look at the words myſelf." "No, indeed," ſaid Stock, "I would not for the world give you unfounded comfort, or put off any notion of my own for a ſcripture doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine." "But is it poſſible!" cried the ſick man, "that God may really pardon me? Do'ſt think he can? Do'ſt think he will?" "I am ſure of it," ſaid Stock; "I dare not give thee falſe hopes, or, indeed any hopes of my own. But theſe are God's own words, and the only dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty is to know when we are really
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:037147_0033_100C95B641392410"/>brought into ſuch a ſtate as that the words may be applied to us.</p>
            <p>Mr. Stock was afraid of ſaying more. He would not venture out of his depth; nor, indeed, was poor Brown able to bear more diſcourſe juſt now. So he made him a preſent of the Bible, folding down ſuch places as he thought might be beſt ſuited to his ſtate, and he took his leave, being obliged to return home that night. He left a little money with the jailor, to add a few comforts to the allowance of the priſon, and promiſed to return in a ſhort time.</p>
            <p>When he got home, he deſcribed the ſufferings and miſery of Brown in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry moving manner; but Tommy Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams, inſtead of being properly affected at it, only ſaid, "Indeed, Maſter, I am not very ſorry; he is rightly ſerved." "How, Tommy," ſaid Mr. Stock, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſternly, "not ſorry to ſee a fellow creature brought to the loweſt ſtate of miſery? one too whom you have known ſo proſperous!" "No, Maſter, I can't
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:037147_0034_100C95B909A42F78"/>ſay I am; for Mr. Brown uſed to make fun of you, and laugh at you for being ſo godly, and reading your Bible."</p>
            <p>"Let me ſay a few words to you Tommy," ſaid Mr. Stock. "In the firſt place you ſhould never watch for the time of a man's being brought low by trouble to tell of his faults. Next, you ſhould never rejoice at his trouble, but pity him, and pray for him. Laſtly, as to his ridiculing me for my religion, if I cannot ſtand an idle joſt, I am not worthy the name of a Chriſtian.—<hi>He that is ashamed of me and my word,</hi> do'ſt remember what follows, Tommy?" "Yes, Maſter, 'twas laſt Sunday's text —<hi>of him shall the Son of Man be asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med when he shall judge the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Stock ſoon went back to the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. But he did not go alone. He took with him Mr. Thomas, the worthy Miniſter who had been the guide and inſtructor of his youth, who was ſo kind as to go at his requeſt and viſit this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn priſoner. When they got to Brown's
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:037147_0035_100C95BA951CB578"/>door, they found him ſitting up in his bed with the Bible in his hand. This was a joyful ſight to Mr. Stock, who ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly thanked God for it. Brown was reading aloud; they liſtened; it was the fifteenth of Saint Luke. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this beautiful Parable of the Prodigal Son were ſo much like his own, that the ſtory pierced him to the ſoul; and he ſtopped every minute to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his own caſe with that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal. He was juſt got to the eighteenth verſe, <hi>I will arise and go to my father,</hi>— at that moment he ſpied his two friends; joy darted into his eyes. "O dear Jem," ſaid he, "it is <hi>not</hi> too late, I will ariſe and go to my father, my heavenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you, Sir, will ſhew me the way, won't you?" ſaid he to Mr. Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, whom he recollected. "I am very glad to ſee you in ſo hopeful a diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on," ſaid the good Miniſter. "O, Sir," ſaid Brown. "what a place is this to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive you in! O, ſee to what I have brought myſelf!"</p>
