            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE great object, for which I had the honor to hold an appointment in the ſervice of my country, being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, I am now preparing to reſign it into the hands of Congreſs, and return to that do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic retirement, which, it is
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:018261_0004_0FA5BCC9F6656A40"/>
well known, I left with the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reluctance; a retirement for which I have never ceaſed to ſigh through a long and painful abſence, in which (remote from the noiſe and trouble of the world) I meditate to paſs the remainder of life, in a ſtate of undiſturbed repoſe; but, before I carry this reſolution into effect, I think it a duty incumbent on me to make this my laſt official communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to congratulate you on the glorious events which Heaven has been pleaſed to produce in our favour, to offer my ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:018261_0005_0FA5BCCACB74FFA8"/>
reſpecting ſome important ſubjects, which appear to me to be intimately connected with the tranquility of the United States, to take my leave of your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency as a public character, and to give my final bleſſing to that country, in whoſe ſervice I have ſpent the prime of my life; for whoſe ſake I have conſumed ſo many anxious days and watchful nights, and whoſe happineſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extremely dear to me, will always conſtitute no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble part of my own.</p>
            <p>Impreſſed with the livelieſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:018261_0006_0FA5BCCB584FCCF8"/>
on this pleaſing occaſion, I will claim the indulgence of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the more copiouſly on the ſubject of our mutual felicitation. When we conſider the magnitude of the prize we contended for, the doubtful nature of the conteſt, and the favourable manner in which it has terminated; we ſhall find the greateſt poſſible reaſon for gratitude and rejoicing; this is a theme that will afford infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light to every benevolent and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beral mind, wether the event in contemplation be conſidered as a ſource of preſent enjoyment,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:018261_0007_0FA5BCCC175C8F70"/>
or the Parent of future happineſs; and we ſhall have equal occaſion to felicitate ourſelves on the lot which Providence has aſſigned us, whether we view it in a natural, a political, or moral point of light.</p>
            <p>The citizens of America, placed in the moſt enviable condition, as the ſole Lords and Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of a vaſt tract of continent, comprehending all the various ſoils and climates of the world, and abounding with all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries and conveniencies of life, are now, by the late ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:018261_0008_0FA5BCCD13907FC8"/>
pacification, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be poſſeſſed of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute freedom and independency; they are from this period to be conſidered as the actors on a moſt conſpicuous theatre, which ſeems to be peculiarly deſigned by Providence for the diſplay of human greatneſs and felicity: Here they are not only ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with every thing that can contribute to the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of private and domeſtic en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment; but Heaven has crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all its other bleſſings, by giving a ſurer opportunity for political
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:018261_0009_0FA5BCCF2DBDA7E0"/>
happineſs, than any other nation has ever been favoured with. Nothing can illuſtrate theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations more forcibly than a recollection of the happy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of times and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, under which our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public aſſumed its rank among the nations.—The foundation of our Empire was not laid in a gloomy age of ignorance and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, but at an epocha when the rights of mankind were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtood and more clearly defined, than at any former pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod: Reſearches of the human
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:018261_0010_0FA5BCCFCF7882A0"/>
mind after ſocial happineſs have been carried to a great extent; the treaſures of knowledge ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the labours of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, ſages and legiſlators, thro' a long ſucceſſion of years, are laid open for uſe, and their collected wiſdom may be happily applied in the eſtabliſhment of our forms of government. The free culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of letters, the unbounded extenſion of commerce, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive refinement of manners, the growing liberality of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and, above all, the pure and benign light of Revelation,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:018261_0011_0FA5BCD3AB9D2940"/>
have had a meliorating influence on mankind, and increaſed the bleſſings of ſociety. At this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicious period the United States came into exiſtence as a nation, and if their citizens ſhould not be completely free and happy, the fault will be entirely their own.</p>
            <p>Such is our ſituation, and ſuch are our proſpects; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Cup of Bleſſing is thus reached out to us, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding happineſs is ours, if we have a diſpoſition to ſeize the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and make it our own, yet
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:018261_0012_0FA5BCD51D202188"/>
it appears to me, there is an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtill left to the United States of America, whether they will be reſpectable and proſperous, or contemptible and miſerable as a nation; this is the time of their political probation; this is the moment when the eyes of the whole world are turned upon them; this is the moment to eſtabliſh or ruin their national character for ever; this is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable moment to give ſuch a tone to the fedral Government, as will enable it to anſwer the ends of its inſtitution; or, this
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:018261_0013_0FA5BCD6254FD970"/>
may be the ill-fated moment for relaxing the powers of the Union, annihilating the cement of the Confederation, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing us to become the ſport of European politics, which may play one State againſt another, to prevent their growing import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and to ſerve their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted purpoſes. For, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſyſtem of policy the States ſhall adopt at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they will ſtand or fall; and, by their confirmation or lapſe, it is yet to be decided, whether the Revolution muſt ultimately
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018261_0014_0FA5BCD6A5D1B3A0"/>
be conſidered as a bleſſing or a curſe;—a bleſſing or a curſe, not to the preſent age alone, for with our fate will the deſtiny of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born millions be involved.</p>
            <p>With this conviction of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the preſent criſis, ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in me would be a crime; I will therefore ſpeak to your Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency the language of freedom and ſincerity, without diſguiſe. I am aware, however, thoſe who differ from me in political ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may, perhaps, remark, I am ſtepping out of the proper line of my duty; and they may
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018261_0015_0FA5BCD75FA42C88"/>
poſſibly aſcribe to arrogance or oſtentation, what I know is alone the reſult of the pureſt intention; but the rectitude of my own heart, which diſdains ſuch unworthy motives; the part I have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to acted in life, the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I have formed of not taking any ſhare in public buſineſs here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; the ardent deſire I feel, and ſhall continue to manifeſt, of quietly enjoying in private life, after all the toils of war, the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of a wiſe and liberal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, will, I flatter myſelf, ſooner or later, convince my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:018261_0016_0FA5BCD825007920"/>
that I could, have no ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter views in delivering with ſo little reſerve the opinions contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this addreſs.</p>
            <p>There are four things which I humbly conceive are eſſential to the well-being, I may even ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſay, to the exiſtence of the United States as an indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent power.</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. An indiſſoluble union of the States under one fedral head.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. A ſacred regard to public juſtice.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. The adoption of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per peace eſtabliſhment. And,</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:018261_0017_0FA5BCDA180C4BB8"/>4thly. The prevalence of that pacific and friendly diſpoſition among the people of the United States, which will induce them to forget their local prejudices and policies, to make thoſe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conceſſions which are requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the general proſperity, and, in ſome inſtances, to ſacrifice their individual advantages to the intereſt of the community.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the pillars on which the glorious fabric of our inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendency and national charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter muſt be ſupported.—Liberty is the baſis—and whoever would
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:018261_0018_0FA5BCDA4A1B14F8"/>
dare to ſap the foundation, or overturn the ſtructure, under whatever ſpecious pretext he may attempt it, will merit the bittereſt execration, and the ſevereſt pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, which can be inflicted by his injured country.</p>
            <p>On the three firſt articles I will make a few obſervations; leaving the laſt to the good ſenſe and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concerned.</p>
            <p>Under the firſt head, although it may not be neceſſary or proper for me in this place to enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a particular diſquiſition of the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:018261_0019_0FA5BCDB16F34268"/>
principles of the union, and to take up the great queſtion which has been frequently agitated, whether it be expedient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for the States to dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate a larger proportion of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Congreſs, or not; yet it will be a part of my duty, and that of every true patriot, to aſſert, without reſerve, and to inſiſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the following poſitions.— That unleſs the States will ſuffer Congreſs to exerciſe thoſe prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives they are undoubtedly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with by the Conſtitution, every thing muſt very rapidly
<pb n="02" facs="unknown:018261_0020_0FA5BCDBD63476A8"/>
tend to anarchy and confuſion. That it is indiſpenſible to the happineſs of the individual States, that there ſhould be lodged, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, a ſupreme power to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late and govern the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the confederated Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, without which the union can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of long duration.</p>
            <p>That there muſt be a faithful and pointed compliance on the part of every State with the late propoſals and demands of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, or the moſt fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences will enſue—That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever meaſures have a tendency
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:018261_0021_0FA5BCDCFAE05788"/>
to diſſolve the union, or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to violate or leſſen the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign authority, ought to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as hoſtile to the Liberty and Independency of America, and the authors of them treated accordingly—And laſtly, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we can be enabled by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the States to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the fruits of the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and enjoy the eſſential be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits of civil ſociety, under a form of government ſo free and uncorrupted, ſo happily guarded againſt the danger of oppreſſion, as has been deviſed and adopted

by the Articles of Confederation, it will be a ſubject of regret, that ſo much blood and treaſure have been laviſhed for no purpoſe; that ſo many ſufferings have been encountered without a compenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that ſo many ſacrifices have been made in vain. Many other conſiderations might here be adduced to prove, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an entire conformity to the ſpirit of the Union, we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt as an independent power. It will be ſufficient for my purpoſe to mention but one or two, which ſeem to me of the greateſt import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:018261_0023_0FA5BCDF8007D3E8"/>
It is only in our united cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, as an empire, that our ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is acknowledged, that our power can be regarded, or our credit ſupported among foreign nations. The Treaties of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean Powers, with the United States of America, will have no validity on a diſſolution of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. We ſhall be left nearly in a ſtate of nature, or we may find by our own unhappy experience, that there is a natural and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary progreſſion from the extreme of anarchy to the extreme of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny; and that arbitrary power is
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:018261_0024_0FA5BCDFB9884198"/>
moſt eaſily eſtabliſhed on the ruins of liberty abuſed to licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>As to the ſecond article, which reſpects the performance of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic juſtice, Congreſs have in their late addreſs to the United States, almoſt exhauſted the ſubject; they have explained their ideas ſo ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and have enforced the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the ſtates are under to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der complete juſtice to all the public creditors, with ſo much dignity and energy, that, in my opinion, no real friend to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and independency of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, can heſitate a ſingle mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:018261_0025_0FA5BCE04955F808"/>
reſpecting the propriety of complying with the juſt and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable meaſures propoſed; if their arguments do not produce conviction, I know of nothing that will have greater influence, eſpecially when we recollect that the ſyſtem referred to, being the reſult of the collected wiſdom of the Continent, muſt be eſteemed, if not perfect, certainly the leaſt objectionable of any that could be deviſed; and that, if it ſhall not be carried into immediate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, a national bankruptcy, with all its deplorable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:018261_0026_0FA5BCE3DBBE5738"/>
will take place before any different plan can poſſibly be propoſed or adopted; ſo preſſing are the preſent circumſtances, and ſuch is the alternative now offered to the States.</p>
            <p>The ability of the country to diſcharge the debts, which have been incurred in its defence, is not to be doubted. And inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, I flatter myſelf, will not be wanting; the path of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is plain before us; honeſty will be found, on every experiment, to be the beſt and only true poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Let us then, as a nation, be
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:018261_0027_0FA5BCE41E0224E8"/>
juſt; let us fulfil the public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts which Congreſs had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a right to make for the purpoſe of carrying on the war, with the ſame good faith we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ourſelves bound to perform our private engagements. In the mean time let an attention to the chearful performance of their proper buſineſs, as individuals, and as members of ſociety, be earneſtly inculcated on the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of America; then will they ſtrengthen the hands of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and be happy under its protection. Every one will reap
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:018261_0028_0FA5BCE56123EAD0"/>
the fruit of his labours; every one will enjoy his own acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without moleſtation, and without danger.</p>
            <p>In this ſtate of abſolute free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and perfect ſecurity, who will grudge to yield a very little of his property to ſupport the common intereſts of ſociety, and enſure the protection of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Who does not remember the frequent declarations at the commencement of the war, That we ſhould be completely ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, if at the expence of one half, we could defend the remainder
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:018261_0029_0FA5BCE779A6F8E0"/>
of our poſſeſſions? Where is the man to be found, who wiſhes to remain in debt for the defence of his own perſon and property to the exertions, the bravery, and the blood of others, without making one generous effort to repay the debt of honour and of gratitude? In what part of the Continent ſhall we find any man, or body of men, who would not bluſh to ſtand up, and propoſe meaſures purpoſely calculated to rob the ſoldier of his ſtipend, and the public creditor of his due? And were it poſſible that ſuch a
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:018261_0030_0FA5BCE7EEDC3740"/>
flagrant inſtance of injuſtice could ever happen, would it not excite the general indignation, and tend to bring down upon the authors of ſuch meaſures the aggravated vengeance of Heaven? If, after all, a ſpirit of diſunion, or a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of obſtinacy and perverſeneſs ſhould manifeſt itſelf in any of the States; if ſuch an ungracious diſpoſition ſhould attempt to fruſtrate all the happy effects that might be expected to flow from the union; if there ſhould be a refuſal to comply with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions for funds to diſcharge
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:018261_0031_0FA5BCE890B6CF00"/>
the annual intereſt of the public debts, and if that refuſal ſhould revive all thoſe jealouſies and produce all thoſe evils which are now happily removed; Congreſs, who have in all their tranſactions ſhewn a great degree of magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and juſtice, will ſtand juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſight of God and man! And that State alone, which puts itſelf in oppoſition to the aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate wiſdom of the Continent, and follows ſuch miſtaken and pernicious councils, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for all the conſequences.</p>
            <p>For my own part, conſcious of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:018261_0032_0FA5BCE94B015E18"/>
having acted, while a ſervant of the public, in the manner I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuited to promote the real intereſts of my country; having, in conſequence of my fixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, in ſome meaſure, pledged myſelf to the army, that their country would finally do them complete and ample juſtice, and not wiſhing to conceal any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of my official conduct from the eyes of the world, I have thought proper to tranſmit to your Excellency the incloſed col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of papers, relative to the half-pay and commutation grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:018261_0033_0FA5BCEA1653AED8"/>
by Congreſs, to the officers of the army; from theſe commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nications, my decided ſentiment will be clearly comprehended, together with the concluſive rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which induced me, at an early period, to recommend the adoption of this meaſure in the moſt earneſt and ſerious manner. As the proceedings of Congreſs, the army, and myſelf, are open to all, and contain, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſufficient information to remove the prejudice and errors which may have been entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any, I think it unneceſſary
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:018261_0034_0FA5BCEACC4A6C60"/>
to ſay any thing more, than juſt to obſerve, that the reſolutions of Congreſs, now alluded to, are as undoubtedly and abſolutely binding upon the United States, as the moſt ſolemn acts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federation or legiſlation.</p>
            <p>As to the idea, which I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, has, in ſome inſtances, prevailed, that the half-pay and commutation are to be regarded merely in the odious light of a penſion, it ought to be exploded for ever: That proviſion ſhould be viewed, as it really was, a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable compenſation offered by
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:018261_0035_0FA5BCEC1F8DC240"/>
Congreſs, at a time when they had nothing elſe to give to officers of the army, for ſervices then to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed: It was the only means to prevent a total dereliction of the ſervice. It was a part of their hire; I may be allowed to ſay, it was the price of their blood, and of your independency; it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore more than a common debt; it is a debt of honour; it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be conſidered as a penſion, or gratuity, nor cancelled until it is fairly diſcharged.</p>
            <p>With regard to the diſtinction between officers and ſoldiers, it
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018261_0036_0FA5BCEE40CBEB20"/>
is ſufficient that the uniform ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of every nation of the world, combined with our own, proves the utility and propriety of the diſcrimination. Rewards in proportion to the aids the public draws from them, are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably due to all its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. In ſome lines, the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers have perhaps generally had as ample compenſation for their ſervices, by the large bounties which have been paid them, as their officers will receive in the propoſed commutation; in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, if, beſides the donation
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018261_0037_0FA5BCF04766C680"/>
of land, the payment of arrear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of cloathing and wages (in which articles all the component parts of the army muſt be put upon the ſame footing) we take into the eſtimate the bounties many of the ſoldiers have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and the gratuity of one year's full pay, which is promiſed to all, poſſibly their ſituation (every circumſtance being duly conſidered) will not be deemed leſs eligible than that of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. Should a further reward, however, be judged equitable, I will venture to aſſert, no man
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018261_0038_0FA5BCF1C848B270"/>
will enjoy greater ſatisfaction than myſelf, if an exemption from taxes for a limited time (which has been petitioned for in ſome inſtances) or any other adequate immunity or compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation be granted to the brave defenders of their country's cauſe. But neither the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or rejection of this propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, will, in any manner, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, much leſs militate againſt, the act of Congreſs, by which they have offered five years full pay, in lieu of the half pay for life, which had been before
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018261_0039_0FA5BCF24B9291F8"/>
promiſed to the officers of the army.</p>
            <p>Before I conclude the ſubject of public juſtice, I cannot omit to mention obligations this country is under to that meritorious claſs of veterans, the non-commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed officers and privates, who have been diſcharged for inability, in conſequence of the reſolution of Congreſs, of the 23d of April, 1782, on an annual penſion for life: their peculiar ſufferings, their ſingular merits, and claims to that proviſion, need only to be known, to intereſt the feelings of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:018261_0040_0FA5BCF3140CD3E8"/>
in their behalf: nothing but a punctual payment of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual allowance, can reſcue them from the moſt complicated miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and nothing could be a more melancholy and diſtreſſing ſight, than to behold thoſe who have ſhed their blood, or loſt their limbs in the ſervice of their country, without a ſhelter, without a friend, and without the means of obtaining any of the comforts or neceſſaries of life, compelled to beg their daily bread from door to door. Suffer me to recommend thoſe of this deſcription, belonging to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:018261_0041_0FA5BCF3D90BC228"/>
your State, to the warmeſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of our Excellency and your Legiſlature.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary to ſay but a few words on the third topic which was propoſed, and which regards particularly the defence of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public. As there can be little doubt but Congreſs will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a proper peace eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the United States, in which a due attention will be paid to the importance of placing the militia of the Union. upon a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and reſpectable footing; if this ſhould be the caſe, I ſhould beg
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:018261_0042_0FA5BCF4880F56D8"/>
leave to urge the great advantage of it in the ſtrongeſt terms.</p>
            <p>The militia of this country muſt be conſidered as the palladium of our ſecurity, and the firſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual reſort in caſe of hoſtility; It is eſſential, therefore, that the ſame ſyſtem ſhould pervade the whole; that the formation and diſcipline of the militia of the Continent, ſhould be abſolutely uniform; and that the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of arms, accoutrements, and military apparatus, ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in every part of the United States. No one, who has
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:018261_0043_0FA5BCF55D32F5D8"/>
not learned it from experience, can conceive the difficulty, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and confuſion, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from a contrary ſyſtem, or the vague arrangements which have hitherto prevalied.</p>
            <p>If, in treating of political points, a greater latitude than uſual has been taken in the courſe of this addreſs, the importance of the criſis, and the magnitude of the objects in diſcuſſion, muſt be my apology. It is, however, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my wiſh nor expectation, that the preceding obſervations ſhould claim any regard, except
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:018261_0044_0FA5BCF769DA8210"/>
ſo far as they ſhall appear to be dictated by a good intention, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonant to the immutable rules of juſtice; calculated to produce a liberal ſyſtem of policy, and foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on whatever experience may have been acquired by a long and cloſe attention to public buſineſs. Here I might ſpeak with more confidence, from my actual ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation; and if it would not ſwell this letter (already too pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix) beyond the bounds I had preſcribed myſelf, I could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate to every mind, open to conviction, that in leſs time,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:018261_0045_0FA5BCF79CC1F040"/>
and with much leſs expence than has been incurred, the war might have been brought to the ſame happy concluſion, if the reſources of the Continent could have been properly called forth; that the diſtreſſes and diſappointments which have very often occurred, have, in too many inſtances, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted more from a want of ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy in the Continental Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than a deficiency of means in the particular States: That the inefficacy of meaſures, ariſing from the want of an adequate authority in the ſupreme power,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:018261_0046_0FA5BCF86DB1B160"/>
from a partial compliance with the requiſitions of Congreſs, in ſome of the States, and from a failure of punctuality in others, while they tended to damn the zeal of thoſe who were more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to exert themſelves, ſerved alſo to accumulate the expences of the war, and to fruſtrate the beſt concerted plans; and that the diſcouragement occaſioned by the complicated difficulties and embarraſſments, in which our affairs were by this means in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, would have long ago produced the diſſolution of any
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:018261_0047_0FA5BCF917FF99B8"/>
army, leſs patient, leſs virtuous, and leſs perſevering, than that which I have the honour to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. But while I mention thoſe things, which are notorious facts, as the defects of our federal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, particularly in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of a war, I beg it may be underſtood, that as I have ever taken a pleaſure in gratefully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging the aſſiſtance and ſupport I have derived from every claſs of citizens; ſo ſhall I always be happy to do juſtice to the unparalleled exertions of the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:018261_0048_0FA5BCFA00DB5470"/>
individual States, on many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting occaſions.</p>
            <p>I have thus freely diſcloſed what I wiſhed to make known, before I ſurrendered up my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic truſt to thoſe who committed it to me. The taſk is now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed; I now bid adieu to your Excellency, as the Chief Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of your State; at the ſame time, I bid a laſt farewell to the cares of office, and all the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments of public life.</p>
            <p>It remains, then, to be my final and only requeſt, that your Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency will communicate theſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:018261_0049_0FA5BCFA8FBF4000"/>
to your Legiſlature, at their next meeting; and that they may be conſidered as the legacy of one who has ardently wiſhed, on all occaſions, to be uſeful to his country, and who, even in the ſhade of retirement, will not fail to implore the divine bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction upon it.</p>
            <p>I now make it my earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that God would have you, and the State over which you preſide, in his holy protection; that he would incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of ſubordination and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:018261_0050_0FA5BCFB824A3E20"/>
to Government; to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a brotherly affection and love for one another, for their fellow-citizens of the United States at large, and particularly for their brethren who have ſerved in the field; and finally, that he would moſt graciouſly be pleaſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe us all to do juſtice, to love mercy, and to demean ourſelves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of the mind, which were the characteriſtics of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Author of our bleſſed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; without an humble imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of whoſe example, in theſe
