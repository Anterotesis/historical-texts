MANAGE OF REASONAND THE DECLINE AND FALL OF THE ENGLISH SYSTEM OF FINANCE  LONDON  PRINTED AND SOLD BY DANIEL ISAAC EATON No NEWGATESTREET  IN CONGRESS  AUGUST  RESOLVED That the early unsolicited and continued labours of Mr THOMAS PAINE in explaining and enforcing the principles of the late revolution by ingenious and timely publications  Common Sense and American Crisis  upon the nature of liberty and civil government have been well received by the citizens of these States and merit the approbation of Congress▪ and that in consideration of these services and the benefits produced thereby MR PAINE is entitled to a liberal gratification from the United States  OCTOBER  RESOLVED That the board of treasury take order for paying to Mr THOMAS PAINE the sum of three thousand dollars for the considerations mentioned in the resolution of the th of August last  THE AMERICAN CRISIS  Answer to the Proclamation of General Gage August    No I  Projicit  ampullas  HOR  On  souls  of slav'ry more than death afraid  Gage  wastes his  pardons  and his  gasconade  GENERAL GAGE's Proclamation lies before me though it is not a subject for criticism yet it deserves notice we may overlook the style but must detest the doctrine with what judgment the General may command with what spirit he may fight with what prudence he may retreat is yet unknown but if his conduct in the field is equal to his composition in the closet the success of his majesty's arms must be owing more to fate than judgment This murderous proclamation opens with great solemnity bold assertions and notorious falsehoods it proceeds with the persevering spirit of the times but alas its imperious offers of clemency and its conceited menaces  are vain alike The one will make no converts for want of confidence and the other can make no cowards for want of power To subjugate America entirely by means of our fleet and standing army is impossible the thought only proves that administration is as weak as it is wicked should they be determined like their misguided master to persevere they will ere long find it impracticable either to go forward or to retreat they will let them mark the words of an unknown writer oblige the people throughout the empire of Great Britain to take the power again into their own hands even anarchy is preferable to despotism especially while the government is in the hands of fools madmen knaves and tyrants hard usage justifies hard namesLet us now proceed to this alluring proclamation this flimsy political trap for antiquated Roman virtue  The General thought fit to arraign the conduct of the Americans as incendiaries and traitors against the constitutional authority of the state if the word incendiary has any meaning in the English language it can only be applied with propriety to one who is the first kindler of commotions in a state according to our constitution the very head that wears the crown may be an incendiary by encouraging a faction which may as well originate in the court as in the cottage if the King and his  Parliament devoted to a vile administration combine to persevere in carrying any one point against the constitution they are from that moment a faction incendiaries and not a government they are traitors traitors to the people Let me now ask whether faction first took rise in America or the mother country In that spot wherever it may be we must look for these incendiaries and traitors I have put the question fairly it is simple plain and determinativeI pause for a reply not from the mouth of a haughty pensioner a Scotch placeman or a fawning courtier but by the decision of a true constitutionalist I am willing to abide In the interim I shall declare my own opinionThat the mother country represented as she is by a corrupt majority first formed a faction herself against the laws and liberties of America nay she has done more she has artfully formed even a religious faction the worst of all others upon that great continent Her government has of late been administered upon such mistaken narrow rotten principles that she did not think herself secure till she had established Popery by act of Parliament at Quebec by way of fomenting dissentions and enmity in those dominions she would enslave or administration knew and feared the principles of the people upon that continent They had read that their ancestors were Puritans and no friends to tyranny or popery  they knew their designs and planted Papists in their rear to keep their rebellious subjects as they call them between two fires and to deter them from taking refuge in the back settlements but they have numbers and virtue sufficient to enable them to keep or at least to recover their ground Thus have a corrupt majority falsely called the Great Council of the Nation themselves departed and encouraged Government to depart in this as well as numberless other instances from the line of right laid down at the Revolution a period but little reverenced by our Statepilots Bute and Mansfield these two men with their lacqueys in and out of Parliament are the real and only incendiaries of America The wretched Americans unjustly branded by every hireling with the name of traitors are only busied and justly busied in extinguishing those flames which such a government if it deserves the name of one has kindled whether the Americans are traitors or unhappy subjects making a lawful resistance to repeated tyrannies must be determined not by hirelings who assassinate for pay but by those who pay them with reluctance by the collective body of the people in whom all power virtually resides from whom it originates and to whom it must perhaps shortly dissolve again What the General calls treason this collective body an awful tribunal will pronounce constitutional resistance  The Americans are next accused of a fatal progression of crimes against the constitutional authority of the stateBy the term constitutional if the General means an authority constitutionally exercised I deny his assertion it is as little founded on truth as our ministerial measures are upon sound policy justice and humanity when the principles of the constitution are abandoned as they have lately been the state may proceed authoritively or rather despotically but it cannot be said to act constitutionallyThat the Americans avow rebellion I deny likewise that they avow resistance as their brave ancestors once did and as all true Revolutionists will do every Briton as an enemy to slavery must rejoice  For the patience and lenity of the King's in truth of Lord Bute's and Lord Mansfield's government I appeal to facts Those who are masters of the disputes between England and America and stand unbiassed by corruption will pass an impartial judgment between the oppressors and oppressed we doubt not but the Sovereign's patience is equal to his other godlike attributes but we know that the patience of America has been severely tried among other invasions she has been stripped of the most valuable privilege the birthright of a British subject trial by juries In many other instances government has attempted to enslave them and shall the aggressors presume to  boast thus of their patience and lenity At what time in what particulars were they exerted Were the humble supplications and remonstrances of America received by either and by which of the three great estates of this kingdom If so a Norton and Apsley or some ministerial paricide can inform us but if they were and they really were rejected with contempt by all what pretence what effrontery have the tools and sycophants of power to insult the understandings of mankind with sounds What hopes for such the General talks of could America ever entertain of such an Administration such a Parliament and such a Sovereign She has alas been driven to despair by all nay her supplications have been finally answered by those divine effects of patience and lenityFamine and the sword Thus have those who are entrusted as the General says with supreme rule manifested to all the world that they bear not the sword in vain Could George the Third that mirror of perseverance that idol of an abandoned Ministry present the sword of justice like the old heathen emperor to the people and bid them use it for him or against him according to his deserts If he could he then bears not the sword in vain but in defiance of heaven and earth in defiance of all laws human and divine nor can he bear it long  But the most sacred rights of the crown and people of Great Britain says the General have been infringed It is a most audacious piece of military insolence after the late act of tyranny assented to by the steady Sovereign to join the names of crown and people together as if their views and interest were still as in truth they ought to be the same Blind to its own interest to its honour to its establishment to its sacred engagements at the altar has the crown whose sole aim is plainly despotic power consulted the interests of the people in its disputes with America The rights of the crown and people were stipulated anew at the Revolution But has the crown kept its compact with the people of America If not by whom have the rights of the people been infringedAs to the rights of the crown as stipulated at the Revolution they are well known and have been religiously submitted to both at home and abroad even in rebellious America but when it begins to stretch out the arm of usurpation it is time that its despotic sinews should be shrunk  That the Americans have been guilty and bravely guilty of premeditation and conspiracy is most true They have been provoked to action and they were too wise to act without thinking They have most virtuously conspired against tyrants and disdained to wear the chains of the most pious King the wisest Administration and most  incorrupt Parliament that Great Britain ever knewFor these demerits the fulness of chastisement is threatened But suppose the chastisers should be chastised I have always understood that true courage was ever accompanied by the greatest modesty History is full of these examples But our Ministry like their Sandwich and their Denbigh have idly thought that America may be subdued by gasconade Such corrupt wretches are strangers to the great effects of virtue Sad experience will inform them soon that all human souls are not as abject as their own  The Americans are next accused of an unnatural revolt If by this expression is meant a revolt against their natural allegiance I answer that when protection is first unjustly withdrawn on the Sovereign's part all allegiance ceases on the subject's The subject must then recur to the rights of nature resistance may ensue but no revolt for the Sovereign by breaking his compact has set the subject free A politician would reason thus but a soldier has no idea of any mode of government but by the swordWe are then told that our colonists dared not trust their cause to the impartial judgment of the public or even to the dispassionate reflection of their followersBut with what truth Were not the General Congresses throughout the continent of America so many open appeals to the judgment of an impartial public  Were not the flagitious prints the popular harangues the declamation from the pulpits which the General complains of so many incitements to the cool dispassionate reflection of their followers Indeed General you should always reason sword in hand The pen is not your fort You are lost upon paper and must at last submit to be vanquished in the field Putnam is in earnest  The poor Americans are charged in the next place with a suppression of truth with obstructing every appeal to the real interest of the people with the grossest forgeries calumnies and absurdities To say that the Americans have been guilty of suppressing truth forging falsehoods venting calumnies and imposing absurdities upon their party is but a kind of petulant recrimination These dishonourable proceedings if true are but the common stratagems of war They are not peculiar to one side only for the King's party has practised them all the insidious spies of Government have practised them General Carleton has practised them most basely you yourself General Gage have practised them as dishonourably but after all is this malicious splenetic recrimination a proof of treason and rebellion against these injured people In spite of all this foul language the world will think that there is as much veracity virtue candour honour and true courage on the part of freemen  who defend as on the part of tyrants who invade their liberties I now wish to be informed of these appeals which have been made if the General says true to the real interest of America  Through what channels have they passed Have either of the three great estates of this kingdom or has the Minister or even a single tool or lacquey of Administration has a North a Sandwich or a Denbigh once condescended to advise admonish or expostulate with America Has the Secretary of State for that department ever had orders to write in such a strain Have not all Lord Bute's servile clan endeavoured on the contrary to carry every thing with a high hand and a menacing audacious front Have they not shut their eyes ears and hearts against every humble approach every filial intercession of America These insolent invaders of royal charters human rights and established laws have been too much slushed with the hopes of conquest to wish cordially for a reconciliation with America They have industriously stopped up every opening towards it The mouths of our patriots and our citizens have been stopped by corrupt votes and majestic insults as to the proposal made by Lord North in his House of Commons it was calculated for the contempt it met with His Lordship was not quite fool enough to think it could take  place By whom then has any appeal to the real interest of America been made by those who would exterminate the people  The prostitution of the press makes the next item in the General's catalogue of complaints If the American press has been prostituted I pray that Doctor Johnson may be called upon to declare upon the honour of a courtpensioner how gloriously the English press has been employed in the cause of truth by his brother Garreteers even the eloquence of the laity and clergy has been exerted says the General to excite and justify devastation and massacre Can a soldier who should be a man of honour assert so gross a falsehood It is notorious that no one popular harangue as the General calls them has been made in America with any other view than that of animating their gallant countrymen to a just defence of their liberties properties and lives the noblest purpose of which the distinguished gift of the speech can serve That the brave and virtuous Americans have animated each other in support of their national rights will be recorded in history to their immortal honour that our perfidious government has armed the Papists whom they patronize at Quebec with a view of destroying their Protestant subjects is a circumstance which will make a figure of a different cast in history and will most assuredly bring the advisers of that measure to an  ignominious death in spite of the standing army employed and paid at present for no other purpose than that of protecting tyrants whether popular harangues made in one case or arms supplied in the other is most characteristic of national honour and virtue may easily be determined And to this the base the cowardly the traiterous design of government after all the parade and military bluster of surrendering Canada to the French a vast province acquired last war at the expence of so much blood and treasure This pusillanimous thought has been suggested to gratify a despairing tyrant I now accompany the General to the account he gives of the th of April last respecting an attack upon the King's troops from behind walls and lurking holes Be it so yet who can believe that the King's troops should have been unprepared for ambuscade or any acts of hostile frenzy as the General calls it Have not the Americans been driven to this frenzy Is it not common for an enemy to take every advantage Is it not uncommon nay impossible that troops charged with vengeance should be unprepared to take it They could not be unprepared for taking it if they were armed nor would they decline taking it if they were Scotchmen Their not taking it therefore must be owing either to a want of spirit or want of conduct or a want of power Since that period of the th of April says the  General the rebels have derived confidence from impunityIs it a matter of merit then with a mercenary soldiery that they did not execute what they were unable to effect This is talking like a driveller General But these rebels these traiterous Revolutionists in America have dared to fire upon the King's ships and subjectsGrantedbut have not these ships invaded them have not these subjects why did you not say soldiers and marines threatened their destruction Is the doctrine of passive obedience and nonresistance to the divine will of tyrants to be observed by the insulted and enslaved Americans till they felt their Sovereign's bayonet in their bosomsThese rebels have proceeded even farther they have affected says our General to hold the King's army besiegedHave they May heavens prosper such a glorious piece of affectation Every constitutionalist throughout the British empire hopes they will not only affect it but effect it every true born Briton longs to see the final triumph of America marked as an epocha in the future annals of his country nor would their joy be checked by the appearance of another blessed martyrdom in the calendar Tyranny and martyrdom like representation and taxation should go together  The charge of invasion upon private property and a wantonness of cruelty is not only indecent but imprudent from that mouth which commands  the King's banditti in America who have so daringly themselves invaded the liberties the properties the laws and lives of a free people with the sword merely because they claim and will maintain the rights of Englishmen  As to the actions of the nineteenth of April last which so often haunt the General's mind they ought to stand for ever recorded in the calendar to the eternal honour of America who that day not only totally disappointed but bravely resisted no considerable party of the King's military assassins If any improprieties were committed on that nineteenth of April by the American troops which cannot easily be pardoned by so consummate a soldier as General Gage yet their gallant behaviour on the seventeenth of June following must surely have deserved his admiration They did not fire then from behind walls and lurking holes but bravely faced attacked and defeated the tyrant's forces This appears sufficiently even from the letter which has been artfully imposed on the public for General Gage's genuine account of that action but let the Minister shew forth the General's real letter if he dares His master lost his colour when he read it and I verily believe that even Lord North the ostensible Minister is not himself entrusted with the true contents of it His Lordship is but the drudge He has the name without the confidence of a Minister and meanly  submits to be responsible for iniquities not his own The real genuine letter so dreadful are its tidings is a secret to all but the tyrant and his gemini the Castor and Pollux of his cabinet Bute and Mansfield They dare not publish it  I am now come to the last effort within the bounds of the General's duty to spare the effusion of blood which he is strictly charged to shed without mercy or reluctance The General according to his orders most dutifully dispatched his blustering Colonel Smith to commence the intended carnage This bully failed yet blood was unnaturally and unjustifiably drawn by our hireling cutthroats at Concord and then the General in commiseration of the calamities which his murderous army had occasioned most humanely offers two months afterwards when he found himself unequal to the task of conquest his Majesty's most gracious pardon to these unhappy sufferers Your treacherous offer is disdainedaway with it and massacre if you can but without an insult the bravest men in the British empire Did not the ancestors of these brave spirits spurn the insidious proclamation of that tyrant Charles and shall their sons fall a prey to the delusive orders of a weaker tyrant and a more consummate hypocrite Will not the gallant Adams and the meritorious Hancock fall with their country if it is her fate to fall Or should they be unfortunately taken  prisoners will they not cast an indignant smile upon the wretch who should affect to pardon them after he had enslaved their country The proclaiming all America except the King's Roman Catholic subjects and good allies at Quebec traitors is but a contemptible echo of that act of parliament which declared them so long since for consulting and preparing only against an intended massacre by sword and famineAmerica despises your threats your clemency and all naval and military terror and parade thou impotent tyrant This General concludes his gasconade with a most notorious falsehood by asserting that the present unnatural rebellion of the Americans as he calls it has stopped the administration of justice in that countryFor shame for shame General A soldier and guilty of a lye Your master knows you know the whole world knows that the rotten Parliament of this nation not only stopped the course but extinguished every benefit of the common law the subjects great inheritance when they dared take away the privilege of juries The design was base atrocious glaring perfidious and tyrannical but why does this unthinking tool of military power call the royal charter of the province to his aid that charter which his master and his parliamentary junto has so grossly violated Is that charter unfavourable to freedom and can it now serve the cause of slavery Has it hitherto  been slighted and is it now made use of to betray the people for whose protection it was granted Has it been so often disallowed with an indignant sneer when America petitioned for redress and is it now set up against her by the shallow tools of power when she is defending those rights and liberties which it gives her Is this royal charter now called in aid of despotic measures through weakness insolence or inadvertency Why General General Your haughty unrelenting master tramples on the royal charters of his wiser predecessors  I tell thee Homicide that the faith of Kings is now no more Our very laws must shortly truckle to the sword The law martial which you have just proclaimed and of which you may shortly taste yourself will if you succeed in America be at length the only law of England Mansfield is an advocate for summary proceedings  The die is cast in the great divan the wise council of this nation and those who would RISE AGAIN to the STATE and LIBERTIES of ENGLISHMEN must RISE through BLOOD The parricides of this constitution General are to be found in England NOT IN AMERICA nor can HAPPINESS PEACE LIBERTY and LAW be now restored unless Providence miraculously intervenes but by ANOTHER REVOLUTION  August  C S  AMERICAN CRISIS  No II  THESE ARE THE TIMES THAT TRY MEN'S SOULS The summer soldier and the sunshine patriot will in this crisis shrink from the service of his country but he that stands it  now  deserves the thanks of man and woman Tyranny like hell is not easily conquered yet we have this consolation with us that the harder the conflict the more glorious the triumph What we obtain too cheap we esteem too lightly 'tis dearness only that gives every thing its value Heaven knows how to set a proper price upon its goods and it would be strange indeed if so celestial an article as freedom should not be highly rated Britain with an army to enforce her tyranny has declared that she has a right not only to tax but "to bind us in all cases whatsoever" and if being bound in that manner is not slavery there is not such a thing as slavery upon earth Even the expression is impious for so unlimited a power can belong only to God  Whether the independence of the continent was declared too soon or delayed too long I will not now enter into as an argument my own simple opinion is that had it been eight months earlier it would have been much better We did not make a proper use of last winter neither could we while we were in a dependent situation However the fault if it were one was all our own we have none to blame but ourselves  The present winter is worth an age if rightly employed but if lost or neglected the whole continent will partake of the evil and there is no punishment that man does not deserve be he who or what or where he will that may be the means of sacrificing a season so precious and useful  But no great deal is lost yet all that Howe has been doing for this month past is rather a ravage than a conquest which the spirit of the Jerseys a year ago would have quickly repulsed and which time and a little resolution will soon recover  I have as little superstition in me as any man living but my secret opinion has ever been and still is that God will not give up a people to military destruction or leave them unsupportedly to perish who had so earnestly and so repeatedly sought to avoid the calamities of war by every decent method which wisdom could invent Neither have I so much of the infidel in me as to suppose that he has relinquished the government of the world and given us up to the care of devils and as I do not I cannot see on what grounds the king  can look up to heaven for help against us A common murderer a highwayman or a housebreaker has as good a pretence as he  'Tis surprising to see how rapidly a panic will sometimes run through a country All nations and ages have been subject to them Britain has trembled like an ague at the report of a French fleet of flatbottomed boats and in the fourteenth century the whole English army after ravaging the kingdom of France was driven back like men petrified with fear and this brave exploit was performed by a few broken forces collected and headed by a woman Joan of Arc Would that heaven might inspire some Jersey maid to spirit up her countrymen and save her fair fellow sufferers from ravage and ravishment Yet panics in some cases have their uses they produce as much good as hurt Their duration is always short the mind soon grows through them and acquires a firmer habit than before But their peculiar advantage is that they are the touchstones of sincerity and hypocrisy and bring things and men to light which might otherwise have lain for ever undiscovered In fact they have the same effect upon secret traitors which an imaginary apparition would upon a private murderer They sift out the private thoughts of man and hold them up in public to the world Many a disguised tory has lately shown his head that shall penitentially solemnize  with curses the day on which Howe arrived upon the Delaware  As I was with the troops at Fort Lee and marched with them to the edge of Pennsylvania I am well acquainted with many circumstances which those who lived at a distance know but little or nothing of Our situation there was exceedingly cramped the place being on a narrow neck of land between the North river and the Hackinsack Our force was inconsiderable being not one fourth so great as Howe could bring against us We had no army at hand to have relieved the garrison had we shut ourselves up and stood on the defence Our ammunition light artillery and the best part of our stores had been removed upon the apprehension that Howe would endeavour to penetrate the Jerseys in which case Fort Lee could have been of no use to us for it must occur to every thinking man whether in the army or not that these kinds of fieldforts are only fit for temporary purposes and last in use no longer than the enemy directs his force against the particular object which such forts were raised to defend Such was our situation and condition at Fort Lee on the morning of the twentieth of November when an officer arrived with information that the enemy with two hundred boats had landed about seven or eight miles above Majorgeneral Green who commanded the garrison immediately ordered them  under arms and sent express to his Excellency General Washington at the town of Hackinsack distant by way of the ferry six miles Our first object was to secure the bridge over the Hackinsack which lay up the river between the enemy and us about six miles from us and three from them General Washington arrived in about three quarters of an hour and marched at the head of the troops to the bridge which place I expected we should have a brush for however they did not choose to dispute it with us and the greatest part of our troops went over the bridge the rest over the ferry except some which passed at a mill on a small creek between the bridge and the ferry and made their way through some marshy grounds up to the town of Hackinsack and there passed the river We brought off as much baggage as the waggons could contain the rest was lost The simple object was to bring off the garrison and to march them on till they could be strengthened by the Jersey or Pennsylvania militia so as to be enbled to make a stand We staid four days at Newark collected in our outposts with some of the Jersey militia and marched out twice to meet the enemy on information of their being advancing though our numbers were greatly inferior to theirs General Howe in my opinion committed a great error in generalship in not throwing a body of sorces off from Staten Island through Amboy by which  means he might have seized all our stores at Brunswick and intercepted our march into Pennsylvania But if we believe the power of hell to be limited we must likewise believe that their agents are under some providential controul  I shall not now attempt to give all the particulars of our retreat to the Delaware Suffice it for the present to say that both officers and men though greatly harrassed and fatigued frequently without rest covering or provision the inevitable consequences of a long retreat bore it with a manly and a martial spirit All their wishes were one which was that the country would turn out and help them to drive the enemy back Voltaire has remarked that king William never appeared to full advantage but in difficulties and in action The same remark may be made on General Washington for the character fits him There is a natural firmness in some minds which cannot be unlocked by trifles but which when unlocked discovers a cabinet of fortitude and I reckon it among those kind of public blessings which we do not immediately see that God hath blessed him with uninterrupted health and given him a mind that can even flourish upon care  I shall conclude this paper with some miscellaneous remarks on the state of our affairs and shall begin with asking the following question Why is it that the enemy hath left the New England provinces  and made these middle ones the seat of war The answer is easy New England is not infested with Tories and we are I have been tender in raising the cry against these men and used numberless arguments to show them their danger but it will not do to sacrifice a world to either their folly or their baseness The period is now arrived in which either they or we must change our sentiments or one or both must fall And what is a tory Good God what is he I should not be afraid to go with an hundred Whigs against a thousand Tories were they to attempt to get into arms Every Tory is a coward for a servile slavish selfinterested fear is the foundation of toryism and a man under such influence though he may be cruel never can be brave  But before the line of irrecoverable separation may be drawn between us let us reason the matter together your conduct is an invitation to the enemy yet not one in a thousand of you has heart enough to join him Howe is as much deceived by you as the American cause is injured by you He expects you will all take up arms and flock to his standard with muskets on your shoulders Your opinions are of no use to him unless you support him personally for it is soldiers and not tories that he wants  I once felt all that kind of anger which a man ought to feel against the mean principles that are  held by the Tories A noted one who kept a tavern at Amboy was standing at his door with as pretty a child in his hand about eight or nine years old as most I ever saw and after speaking his mind as freely as he thought was prudent finished with this unfatherly expression "Well give me peace in my days" Not a man lives on the continent but fully believes that separation must some time or other finally take place and a generous parent would have said "if there must be trouble let it be in my days that my child may have peace" and this single reflection well applied is sufficient to awaken every man to duty Not a place upon earth might be so happy as America Her situation is remote from all the wrangling world and she has nothing to do but to trade with them A man may easily distinguish in himself between temper and principle and I am as confident as I am that God governs the world that America will never be happy till she gets clear of foreign dominion Wars without ceasing will break out till that period arrives and the continent must in the end be conqueror for though the flame of liberty may sometimes cease to shine the coal never can expire  America did not nor does not want force but she wanted a proper application of that force Wisdom is not the purchase of a day and it is no wonder we should on at first setting off From an  excess of tenderness we were unwilling to raise an army and trusted our cause to the temporary defence of a well meaning militia A summer's experience has now taught us better yet with those troops while they were collected we were able to set bounds to the progress of the enemy and thank God they are again assembling I always considered a militia as the best troops in the world for a sudden exertion but they will not do for a long campaign Howe it is probable will make an attempt on this city should he fail on this side the Delaware he is ruined if he succeeds our cause is not ruined He stakes all on his side against a part on ours admitting he succeeds the consequence will be that armies from both ends of the continent will march to assist their suffering friends in the middle states for he cannot go every where it is impossible I consider Howe as the greatest enemy the tories have he is bringing a war into their own country which had it not been for him and partly for themselves they had been clear of Should he now be expelled I wish with all the devotion of a christian that the names of whig and tory may never more be mentioned but should the tories give him encouragement to come or assistance if he come I as sincerely wish that our next year's arms may expel them from the continent and the congress appropriate their possessions to the relief of those who have suffered in welldoing  A single successful battle next year will settle the whole America will carry on a twoyears war by the confiscation of the property of disaffected persons and be made happy by their expulsion Say not that this is revenge call it rather the soft resentment of a suffering people who having no object in view but the good of all have staked their own all upon a seemingly doubtful event Yet it is folly to argue against determined hardness eloquence may strike the car and the language of sorrow draw forth the tear of compassion but nothing can reach the heart that is steeled with prejudice  Quitting this class of men I turn with the warm ardour of a friend to those who have nobly stood and are yet determined to stand the matter out I call not upon a few but upon all not on this state or that state but on every state Up and help us Lay your shoulders to the wheel Better have too much force than too little when so great an object is at stake Let it be told to the future world that in the depth of winter when nothing but hope and virtue could survive that the city and the country alarmed at one common danger came forth to meet and to repulse it Say not that thousands are gone turn out your tens of thousands throw not the burden of the day upon providence but show your faith by your good works that God may bless you It matters not  where you live or what rank of life you hold the evil or the blessing will reach you all The far and the near the home counties and the back the rich and the poor shall suffer or rejoice alike The heart that feels not now is dead The blood of his children shall curse his cowardice who shrinks back at a time when a little might have saved the whole and made them happy I love the man that can smile in troublethat can gather strength from distress and grow brave by reflection It is the business of little minds to shrink but he whose heart is firm and whose conscience approves his conduct will pursue his principles unto death My own line of reasoning is to myself as strait and clear as a ray of light Not all the treasures of the world so far as I believe could have induced me to support an offensive war for I think it murder but if a thief break into my houseburn and destroy my property and kill or threaten to kill me and those that are in it and to "bind me in all cases whatsoever" to his absolute will am I to suffer it What signifies it to me whether he who does it is a king or a common man my countryman or not my countryman whether it is done by an individual villain or an army of them If we reason to the root of things we shall find no difference neither can any just cause be assigned why we should punish in the one case and pardon in the other Let them call  me rebel and welcome I feel no concern from it but I should suffer the misery of devils were I to make a whore of my soul by swearing allegiance to one whose character is that of a sottish stupid stubborn worthless brutish man I conceive likewise a horrid idea in receiving mercy from a being who at the last day shall be shrieking to the rocks and mountains to cover him and fleeing with terror from the orphan the widow and the slain of America  There are cases which cannot be overdone by language and this is one There are persons too who see not the full extent of the evil that threatens them They solace themselves with hopes that the enemy if they succeed will be merciful It is the madness of folly to expect mercy from those who have refused to do justice and even mercy where conquest is the object is only a trick of war The cunning of the fox is as murderous as the violence of the wolf and we ought to be equally on our guard against both Howe's first object is partly by threats and partly by promises to terrify or seduce the people to give up thei arms and receive mercy The ministry recommended the same plan to Gage and this is what the tories call making their peace"a peace which passeth all understanding" indeed A peace which would be the immediate forerunner o a worse ruin than any we have yet thought of Ye  men of Pennsylvania do reason upon those things Were the back counties to give up their arms they would fall an easy prey to the Indians who are all armed This perhaps is what some tories would not be sorry for Were the home counties to deliver up their arms they would be exposed to the resentment of the back counties who would then have it in their power to chastise their defection at pleasure And were any one state to give up its arms that state must be garrisoned by all Howe's army of Britons and Hessians to preserve it from the anger of the rest Mutual fear is a principal link in the chain of mutual love and woe be to that state that breaks the compact Howe is mercifully inviting you to a barbarous destruction and men must be either rogues or fools that will not see it I dwell not upon the vapours of imagination I bring reason to your ears and in language as plain as A B C hold up truth to your eyes  I thank God that I fear not I see no real cause for fear I know our situation well and can see the way out of it While our army was collected Howe dared not risk a battle and it is no credit to him that he decamped from the White Plains and waited a mean opportunity to ravage the defenceless Jerseys but it is great credit to us▪ that with an handful of men we sustained an orderly retreat for near an hundred miles brought off our ammunition all our field pieces the  greatest part of our stores and had four rivers to pass None can say that our retreat was precipitate▪ for we were near three weeks in performing it that the country might have time to come in Twice we marched back to meet the enemy and remained out till dark The sign of fear was not seen in our camp and had not some of the cowardly and disaffected inhabitants spread false alarms through the country the Jerseys had never been ravaged Once more we are again collected and collecting Our new army at both ends of the continent is recruiting fast and we shall be able to open the next campaign with sixty thousand men well armed and cloathed This is our situation and who will may know it By perseverance and fortitude we have the prospect of a glorious issue by cowardice and submission the sad choice of a variety of evilsa ravaged countrya depopulated cityhabitations without safetyand slavery without hopeour homes turned into barracks and bawdyhouses for Hessiansand a future race to provide for whose fathers we shall doubt of Look on this picture and weep over it and if there yet remains one thoughtless wretch who believes it not let him suffer it unlamented  December  C S  AMERICAN CRISIS  No III  What's in the name of lord that I should fear  To bring my grievance to the public ear  CHURCHILL  TO LORD HOWE  UNIVERSAL empire is the prerogative of a writer His concerns are with all mankind and though he cannot command their obedience he can assign them their duty The republic of letters is more ancient than monarchy and of far higher character in the world than the vassal court of Britain he that rebels against reason is a real rebel but he that in defence of reason rebels against tyranny has a better title to "defender of the faith" than George the third  As a military man your lordship may hold out the sword of war and call it the  "ultima ratio regum  " the last reason of kings we in return can shew you the sword of justice and call it "the best scourge of tyrants" The first of these two  may threaten or even frighten for a while and cast a sickly langour over an insulted people but reason will soon recover the debauch and restore them again to tranquil fortitude Your Lordship I find has now commenced author and published a Proclamation I too have published a Crisis as they stand they are the antipodes of each other both cannot rise at once and one of them must descend and so quick is the revolution of things that your Lordship's performance I see has already fallen many degrees from its first place and is now just visible on the edge of the political horizon  It is surprising to what a pitch of infatuation blind folly and obstinacy will carry mankind and your Lordship's drowsy Proclamation is a proof that it does not even quit them in their sleep Perhaps you thought America too was taking a nap and therefore chose like Satan to Eve to whisper the delusion softly lest you should awaken her This continent Sir is too extensive to sleep all at once and too watchful even in its slumbers not to startle at the unhallowed foot of an invader You may issue your proclamations and welcome for we have learned to "reverence ourselves" and scorn the insulting ruffian that employs you America for your deceased brother's sake would gladly have shewn you respect and it is a new aggravation to her seelings that Howe should be  forgetful and raise his sword against those who at their own charge raised a monument to his brother But your master has commanded and you have not enough of nature left to refuse Surely there must be something strangely degenerating in the love of monarchy that can so completely wear a man down to an ingrate and make him proud to lick the dust that kings have trode upon A few more years should you survive them will bestow on you the title of an old man and in some hour of future reflection you may probably find the fitness of Wolsey's despairing penitence "Had I served my God as faithfully as I have served my king he would not thus have forsaken me in my old age"  The character you appear to us in is truly ridiculous Your friends the tories announced your coming with high descriptions of your unlimited powers but your Proclamation has given them the lie by shewing you to be a commissioner without authority Had your powers been ever so great they were nothing to us farther than we pleased because we had the same right which other nations had to do what we thought was best "The United States of America" will found as pompously in the world or in history as "the Kingdom of Great Britain" the character of General Washington will fill a page with as much lustre as that of Lord Howe and the congress  have as much right to command the king and parliament of London to desist from legislation as they or you have to command the congress Only suppose how laughable such an edict would appear from us and then in that merry mood do but turn the tables upon yourself and you will see how your Proclamation is received here Having thus placed you in a proper position in which you may have a full view of folly and learn to despise it I hold up to you for that purpose the following quotation from your own lunarian Proclamation "And we Lord Howe and General Howe do command and in his Majesty's name forsooth all such persons as are assembled together under the name of general or provincial congresses committees conventions or other associations by whatever name or names known or distinguished to desist and cease from all such treasonable actings and doings"  You introduce your Proclamation by referring to your declarations of the th of July and th of September In the last of these you sunk yourself below the character of a private gentleman That I may not seem to accuse you unjustly I shall state the circumstance By a verbal invitation of yours communicated to congress by General Sullivan then a prisoner on his parole you signified your desire of conferring with some members of that body as private gentlemen It  was beneath the dignity of the American congress to pay any regard to a message that at best was but a genteel affront and had too much of the ministerial complexion of tampering with private persons and which might probably have been the case had the gentlemen who were deputed on that business possessed that easy kind of virtue which an English courtier is so truly distinguished by Your request however was complied with for honest men are naturally more tender of their civil than their political fame The interview ended as every sensible man thought it would for your Lordship knows as well as the writer of the Crisis that it is impossible for the King of England to promise the repeal or even the revisal of any acts of parliament wherefore on your part you had nothing to say more than to request in the room of demanding the entire surrender of the continent and then if that was complied with to promise the that the inhabitants should escape with their lives This was the upshot of the conference You informed the conferees that you were two months in soliciting these powers We ask what powers▪ for as commissioner you have none If you mean the power of pardoning it is an oblique proof that your master was determined to sacrifice all before him and that you were two months in dissuading him from his purpose Another evidence of his savage obstinacy From your own  account of the matter we may justly draw these two conclusions first that you serve a monster and secondly that never was a commissioner sent on a more foolish errand than yourself This plain language may perhaps sound uncoothly to an ear vitiated by courtly resinements but words were made for use and the fault lies in deserving them or the abuse in applying them unfairly  Soon after your return to NewYork you published a very illiberal and unmanly hand bill against the congress for it was certainly stepping out of the line of common civility first to screen your national pride by soliciting an interview with them as private gentlemen and in the conclusion to endeavour to deceive the multitude by making an handbill attack on the whole body of the congress you got them together under one name and abused them under another But the king you serve and the cause you support afford you so few instances of acting the gentleman that out of pity to your situation the congress pardoned the insult by taking no notice of it  You say in that handbill "that they the congress disavowed every purpose for reconciliation not consonant with their extravagant and inadmissible claim of independence"  Why God bless me what have you to do with our independence we asked no leave of yours to set it up we ask no money of yours to support it  we can do better without your fleets and armies than with them you may soon have enough to do to protect yourselves without being burthened with us We are very willing to be at peace with you to buy of you and sell to you and like young beginners in the world to work for our own living therefore why do you put yourselves out of cash when we know you cannot spare it and we do not desire you to run into debt I am willing Sir you should see your folly in every view I can place it and for that reason descend sometimes to tell you in jest what I wish you to see in earnest But to be more serious with you why do you say "their" independence To set you right Sir we tell you that the independency is ours not theirs The congress were authorised by every state on the continent to publish it to all the world and in so doing are not to be considered as the inventors but only as the heralds that proclaimed it or the office from which the sense of the people received a legal form and it was as much as any or all their heads were worth to have treated with you on the subject of submission under any name whatever But we know the men in whom we have trustedcan England say the same of her parliament  I come now more particularly to your Proclamation of the th of November last Had you gained an entire conquest over all the armies of  America and then put forth a proclamation offering what you call mercy your conduct would have had some spacious shew of humanity but to creep by surprise into a province and there endeavour to terrify and seduce the inhabitants from their just allegiance to the rest by promises which you neither meant nor were able to fulfil is both cruel and unmanly cruel in its effects because unless you can keep all the ground you have marched over how are you in the words of your Proclamation to secure to your proselytes "the enjoyment of their property" What are to become either of your newadopted subjects or your old friends the tories in Burlington Bordentown Trenton Montholly and many other places where you proudly lorded it for a few days and then fled with the precipitation of a pursued thief What I say are to become of those wretches What are to become of those who went over to you from this city and state What more can you say to them than "shift for yourselves" Or what more can they hope for than to wander like vagabonds over the face of the earth You may now tell them to take their leave of America and all that once was theirs Recommend them for consolation to your master's court there perhaps they may make a shift to live on the scraps of some dangling parasite and chuse companions among thousands  like themselves A traitor is the foulest fiend on earth  In a political sense we ought to thank you for thus bequeathing estates to the continent we shall soon at this rate be able to carry on a war without expence and grow rich by the ill policy of Lord Howe and the generous defection of the tories Had you set your foot into this city you would have bestowed estates upon us which we never thought of by bringing forth traitors we were unwilling to suspect "But these men" you will say "are his majesty's most faithful subjects" let that honour then be all their fortune and let his majesty take them to himself  I am now thoroughly disgusted with them they live in ungrateful case and bend their whole minds to mischief It seems as if God had given them over to a spirit of infidelity and that they are open to conviction in no other line but that of punishment It is time to have done with tarring feathering carting and taking securities for their future good behaviour Every sensible man must feel a conscious shame at seeing a poor fellow hawked for a shew about the streets when it is known that he is only the tool of some principal villian blassed into his offence by the force of false reasoning or bribed thereto through sad necessity We dishonour ourselves by attacking such trifling characters while greater ones are suffered to escape 'Tis our duty  to find them out and their proper punishment would be to exile them from the continent for ever The circle of them is not so great as some imagine The influence of a sew has tainted many who are not naturally corrupt A continual circulation of lies among those who are not much in the way of hearing them contradicted will in time pass for truth and the crime lies not in the believer but the inventor I am not for declaring war against every man that appears not so warm as myself Difference of constitution temper habit of speaking and many other things will go a great way in sixing the outward character of a man yet simple honesty may remain at bottom Some men have naturally a military turn and can brave hardships and the risk of life with a chearful face others have not no slavery appears to them so great as the fatigue of arms and no terror so powerful as that of personal danger What can we say We cannot alter nature neither ought we to punish the son because the father begot him in a cowardly mood However I believe most men have more courage than they know of and that a little at first is enough to begin with I knew the time when I thought that the whistling of a cannon ball would have frightened me almost to death but I have since tried it and find I can stand it with as little discomposure and I believe with a much easier conscience than your Lordship The same dread  would return to me again were I in your situation for my solemn belief of your cause is that it is hellish and damnable and under that conviction every thinking man's heart must fail him  From a concern that a good cause should be dishonoured by the least disunion among us I said in my former paper No II that "should the enemy now be expelled I wish with all the sincerity of a christian that the names of whig and tory might never more be mentioned" but there is a knot of men among us of such a venomous cast that they will not admit even one's good wishes to act in their favour Instead of rejoicing that heaven had as it were providentially preserved this city from plunder and destruction by delivering so great a part of the enemy into our hands with so little effusion of blood they stubbornly affected to disbelieve it until within an hour nay half an hour of the prisoners arriving and the quakers  I have ever been careful of charging offences upon whole societies of men but as the paper referred to is put forth by an unknown fet of men who claim to themselves the right of representing the whole and while the whole society of Quakers admit its validity by a silent acknowledgment it is impossible that any distinction can be made by the public and the more so because the NewYork paper of the th of December printed by permission of our enemies says that "the Quakers begin to speak openly of their attachment to the British constitution" We are certain that we have many friends among them and wish to know them  put forth a testimony dated the twentieth of December signed John Pemberton declaring their attachment to the British government These  men are continually harping on the great sin of our bearing arms but the king of Briton may lay waste the world in blood and famine and they poor fallen souls have nothing to say  In some future paper I intend to distinguish between the different kinds of persons who have been denominated tories for this I am clear in that all are not so who have been called so nor all men whigs who were once thought so and as I mean not to conceal the name of any true friend when there shall be occasion to mention him neither will I that of an enemy who ought to be known let his rank station or religion be what it may  Much pains have been taken by some to set your Lordship's private character in an amiable light but as it has chiefly been done by men who know nothing about you and who are no ways remarkable for their attachment to us we have no just authority for believing it George the Third was imposed upon us by the same arts but time has at length done him justice and the same fate may probably attend your Lordship Your avowed purpose here is to kill conquer plunder pardon and enslave and the ravages of your army through the Jerseys have been marked with as much barbarism as if you had openly professed yourself the prince of ruffians Not even the appearance of humanity has been preserved either on the march or the retreat of your troops No general  order that I could ever learn has ever been issued to prevent or even forbid your troops from robbery wherever they came and the only instance of justice if it can be called such which has distinguished you for impartiality is that you treated and plundered all alike What could not be carried away have been destroyed and mahogany furniture has been deliberately laid on the fire for fuel rather than the men should be fatigued with cutting wood  As some people may doubt the truth of such wanton destruction I think it necessary to inform that one of the people called Quakers who lives at Trenton gave me this information at the house of Mr Michael Hutchinson one of the same profession who lives near to Trenton ferry on the Pennsylvania side Mr Hutchinson being present  There was a time when the whigs confided much in your supposed candour and the tories rested themselves on your favour The experiments have now been made and failed and every town nay every cottage in the Jerseys where your arms have been is a testimony against you How you may rest under this sacrifice of character I know not but this I know that you sleep and rise with the daily curses of thousands upon you Perhaps the misery which the tories have suffered by your proffered mercy may give them some claim to their country's pity and be in the end the best favour you could shew them  In a folio general order book belonging to Colonel Rahl's battalion taken at Trenton and now  now in the possession of the council of safety for this state the following barbarous order is frequently repeated "His excellency the commander in chief orders that all inhabitants which shall be found with arms not having an officer with them shall be immediately taken and hung up" How many you may thus have privately sacrificed we know not and the account can only be settled in another world Your treatment of prisoners in order to distress them to enlist into your infernal service is not to be equalled by any instance in Europe Yet this is the humane Lord Howe and his brother whom the tories and their threequarter kindred the quakers or some of them at least have been holden up for patterns of justice and mercy  A bad cause will ever be supported by bad means and bad men and whoever will be at the pains of examining strictly into things will find that one and the same spirit of opposition and impiety more or less governs through your whole party in both countries Not many days ago I accidentally fell in company with a person of this city noted for espousing your cause and on my remarking to him that it appeared clear to me by the late providential turn of affairs that God Almighty was visibly on our side he replied we care nothing for that you may have him and welcome if we have but enough of the devil on our side we shall do However carelessly this be spoken matters not  'tis still the insensible principle that directs all your conduct and will at last most assuredly deceive and ruin you  If ever a nation was mad and foolish blind to its own interest and bent on its own destruction it is Britain There are such things as national sins and though the punishment of individuals may be reserved to another world national punishment can only be inflicted in this world Britain as a nation is in my inmost belief the greatest and most ungrateful offender against God on the face of the whole earth Blessed with all the commerce she could wish for and furnished by a vast extent of dominion with the means of civilizing both the eastern and western world she has made no other use of both than proudly to idolize her own "thunder" and rip up the bowels of whole countries for what she could get Like Alexander she has made war her sport and inflicted misery for prodigality sake The blood of India is not yet repaid nor the wretchedness of Africa yet requited Of late she has enlarged her lift of national cruelties by her butcherly destruction of the Caribbs of St Vincent's and in returning an answer by the sword to the meek prayer for "peace liberty and safety" These are serious things and whatever a foolish tyrant a debauched court a trafficking legislature or a blinded people may think the national account with heaven must some  day or other be settled All countries have sooner or later been called to their reckoning The proudest empires have sunk when the balance was struck and Britain like an individual penitent must undergo her day of sorrow and the sooner it happens to her the better As I wish it over I wish it to come but withal wish that it may be as light as possible  Perhaps your Lordship has no taste for serious things By your connexions in England I should suppose not therefore I shall drop this part of the subject and take it up in a line in which you will better understand me  By what means may I ask do you expect to conquer America If you could not effect it in the summer when our army was less than yours nor in the winter when we had none how are you to do it In point of generalship you have been outwitted and in point of fortitude outdone your advantages turn out to your loss and shew us that it is in our power to ruin you by gifts Like a game of drafts we can move out of one square to let you come in in order that we may afterwards take two or three for one and as we can always keep a double corner for ourselves we can always prevent a total defeat You cannot be so insensible as not to see that we have two to one the advantage of you because we conquer by a drawn game and you lose by it Burgoyne might  have taught your Lordship this knowledge he has been long a student in the doctrine of chances  I have no other idea of conquering countries than by subduing the armies which defend them have you done this or can you do this If you have not it would be civil in you to let your proclamations alone for the present otherwise you will ruin more tories by your grace and favour than you will whigs by your arms  Were you to obtain possession of this city you would not know what to do with it more than to plunder it To hold it in the manner you hold New York would be an additional dead weight upon your hands and if a general conquest is your object you had better be without the city than with it When you have defeated all our armies the cities will fall into your hands of themselves but to creep into them in the manner you got into Princetown Trenton c is like robbing an orchard in the night before the fruit be ripe and running away in the morning Your experiment in the Jerseys is sufficient to teach you that you have something more to do than barely to get into other people's houses and your new converts to whom you promised all manner of protection and seduced into new guilt by pardoning them from their former virtues must begin to have a very contemptible opinion both of your power and policy Your authority in the Jerseys is now reduced  to the small circle which your army occupies and your Proclamation is no where else seen unless it be to be laughed at The mighty subduers of the continent are retreated into a nutshell and the proud forgivers of our sins are fled from those they came to pardon and all this at a time when they were dispatching vessel after vessel to England with the great news of every day In short you have managed your Jersey expedition so very dexterously that the dead only are conquerors because none will dispute the ground with them In all the wars you have formerly been concerned in you had only armies to contend with in this case you have both an army and a country to combat with In former wars the countries followed the fate of their capitals Canada fell with Quebec and Minorca with Port Mahon or St Philips by subduing those the conquerors opened a way into and became masters of the country here it is otherwise if you get possession of a city here you are obliged to shut yourselves up in it and can make no other use of it than to spend your country's money in This is all the advantage you have drawn from NewYork and you would draw less from Philadelphia because it requires more force to keep it and is much farther from the sea A pretty figure you and the Tories would cut in this city with a river full of ice and a town full of fire for the immediate  consequence of your getting here would be that you would be cannonaded out again and the tories be obliged to make good the damage and this sooner or later will be the fate of New York  I wish to see the city saved not so much from military as from natural motives It is the hidingplace of women and children and Lord Howe's proper business is with our armies When I put all the circumstances together which ought to be taken I laugh at your notion of conquering America Because you lived in a little country where an army might run over the whole in a few days and where a single company of soldiers might put a multitude to the rout you expected to find it the same here It is plain that you brought over with you all the narrow notions you were bred up with and imagined that a proclamation in the king's name was to do great things but Englishmen always travel for knowledge and your Lordship I hope will return if you return at all much wiser than you came  We may be surprised by events we did not expect and in that interval of recollection you may gain some temporary advantage such was the case a few weeks ago but we soon ripen again into reason collect our strength and while you are preparing for a triumph we come upon you with a defeat Such it has been▪ and such it would be were you to try it an hundred times over Were  you to garrison the places you might march over in order to secure their subjection for remember you can do it by no other means your army would be like a stream of water running to nothing By the time you reached from New York to Virginia you would be reduced to a string of drops not capable of hanging together while we by retreating from state to state like a river turning back upon itself would acquire strength in the same proportion as you lost it and in the end be capable of overwhelming you The country in the mean time would suffer but it is a day of suffering and we ought to expect it What we contend for is worthy the affliction we may go through If we get but bread to eat and any kind of raiment to put on we ought not only to be contented but thankful more than that we ought not to look for and less than that heaven has not yet suffered us to want He that would fell his birthright for a little salt is as worthless as he who sold it for porrage without falt and he that would part with it for a gay coat or a plain coat ought for ever to be a slave in buff What are salt sugar and finery to the inestimable blessings of "Liberty and Safety" Or what are the inconveniences of a few months to the tributary bondage of ages The meanest peasant in America blessed with these sentiments is a happy man compared with a New York tory he can eat his  morsel without repining and when he has done can sweeten it with a repast of wholesome air he can take his child by the hand and bless it without feeling the conscious shame of neglecting a parent's duty  In publishing these remarks I have several objects in view On your part they are to expose the folly of your pretended authority as a commissionerthe wickedness of your cause in general and the impossibility of your conquering us at any rate On the part of the public my meaning is to shew them their true and solid interest to encourage them to their own good to remove the fears and falsities which bad men had spread and weak men had encouraged and to excite in all men a love for union and a chearfulness for duty  I shall submit one more case to you respecting your conquest of this country and then proceed to new observations  Suppose our armies in every part of the continent immediately to disperse every man to his home or where else he might be safe and engage to reassemble again on a certain future day It is clear that you would then have no army to contend with yet you would be as much at a loss as you are now you would be afraid to send your troops in parties over the continent either to disarm or prevent us from assembling lest they should not return and while you kept them together  having no army of ours to dispute with you could not call it a conquest You might furnish out a pompous page in the London Gazette or the New York paper but when we returned at the appointed time you would have the same work to do you had at first  It has been the folly of Britain to suppose herself more powerful than she really is and by that means have arrogated to herself a rank in the world she is not entitled to for more than this century past she has not been able to carry on a war without foreign assistance In Marlborough's campaigns and from that day to this the number of German troops and officers assisting her have been about equal with her own Ten thousand Hessians were sent to England last war to protect her from a French invasion and she would have cut but a poor figure in her Canadian and West Indian expeditions had not America been lavish of her men and money to help her along The only instance in which she was engaged singly that I can recollect was against the rebellion in Scotland in and and in that out of three battles she was twice beaten till by thus reducing their numbers as we shall yours and taking a supply ship that was coming to Scotland with clothes arms and money as we have often done she was at last enabled to defeat them  England was never famous by land Her officers  have generally been suspected of cowardice have more of the air of a dancing master than a soldier and by the sample we have taken prisoners we begin to give the preference to ourselves Her strength of late has laid in her extravagance but as her finances and her credit are now low her sinews in that line begin to fail fast As a nation she is the poorest in Europe for were the whole kingdom and all that is in it to be put up to sale like the estate of a bankrupt it would not fetch as much as she owes Yet this thoughtless wretch must go to war and with the avowed design too of making us beasts of burden to support her in riot and debauchery and to assist her afterwards in distressing those nations who are now our best friends This ingratitude may suit a tory or the unchristian peevishness of a fallen quaker but none else  It is the unhappy temper of the English to be pleased with any war right or wrong be it but successful but they soon grow discontented with ill fortune and it is an even chance that they are as clamourous for peace next summer as the king and his ministers were for war last winter In this natural view of things your Lordship stands in a very ugly critical situation Your whole character is staked upon your laurels if they wither you wither with them If they flourish you cannot live long to look at them and at any rate the  black account hereafter is not far off What lately appeared to us misfortunes were only blessings in disguise and the seeming advantages on your side have turned out to our profit Even our loss of this city as far as we can see might be a principal gain to us The more surface you spread over the thinner you will be and the easier wiped away and our consolation under that apparent disaster would be that the estates of the tories would be securities for the repairs In short there is no old ground we can fail upon but some new foundation rises again to support us "We have put Sir our hands to the ploughand cursed be he that looketh back"  Your king in his speech to parliament last spring declared to them that "he had no doubt but the great force they had enabled him to send to America would effectually reduce the rebellious colonies" It has notneither can it But it has done just enough to say the foundation of its own next year's ruin You are sensible that you left England in a divided distracted state of politics and by the command you had here you became a principal prop in the court party their fortunes rest on yours by a single express you can fix their value with the public and the degree to which their spirits shall rise or fall They are in your hands as stock and you have the secret of the alley with you Thus situated and connected you  become the unintentional mechanical instrument of your own and their overthrow The king and his ministers put conquest out of doubt and the credit of both depended on the proof To support them in the interim it was necessary that you should make the most of every thing and we can tell by Hugh Gaine's New York paper what the complexion of the London Gazette is With such a list of victories the nation cannot expect you will ask new supplies and to confess your want of them would give the lie to your triumphs and impeach the king and his ministers of treasonable deception If you make the necessary demand at home your party sinks if you make it not you sink yourself To ask it now is too late and to ask it before was too soon and unless it arrive quickly will be of no use In short the part you have to act cannot be acted and I am fully persuaded that all you have to trust to is to do the best with what force you have got or little more Though we have greatly excelled you in point of generalship and bravery of men yet as a people we have not entered into the full soul of enterprize for I who know England and the disposition of the people well am confident that it is easier for us to effect a revolution there than you a conquest here A few thousand men landed in England with the declared design of deposing the present king▪ bringing his ministers to trial and setting up the  Duke of Gloucester in his stead would assuredly carry their point while you were grovelling here ignorant of the matter As I send all my papers to England this like Common Sense will find its way there and though it may put one party on their guard it will inform the other and the nation in general of our design to help them  Thus far Sir I have endeavoured to give you a picture of present affairs you may draw from it what conclusion you please I wish as well to the true posterity of England as you can but I consider independence as America's natural right and interest and never could see any real disservice it would be to Britain If an English merchant receives an order and is paid for it it signifies nothing to him who governs the country This is my creed of politics If I have any where expressed myself over warmly it is from a fixt immoveable hatred I have and ever had to cruel men and cruel measures I have likewise an aversion to monarchy as being too debasing to the dignity of man but I never troubled others with my notions till very lately nor ever published a syllable in England in my life What I write is pure nature and my pen and my soul have ever gone together My writings I have always given away reserving only the expence of printing and paper and sometimes not even that I have never courted either fame or interest and my manner  of life to those who know it will justify what I say My study is to be useful and if your Lordship love mankind as well as I do you would seeing you cannot conquer us cast about and lend your hand towards accomplishing a peace Our independence with God's blessing we will maintain against all the world but as we wish to avoid evil ourselves we wish not to inflict it on others I am never over inquisitive into the secrets of the cabinet but I have some notion if you neglect the present opportunity that it will not be in our power to make a separate peace with you afterwards for whatever treaties or alliances we form we shall most faithfully abide by wherefore you may be deceived if you think you can make it with us at any time A lasting independent peace is my wish end and aim and to accomplish that "I pray God the Americans may never be defeated and I trust while they have good officers and are well commanded and willing to be commanded that they never will"  C S  Philadelphia  Jan  AMERICAN CRISIS  No IV  IN the progress of politics as in the common occurrences of life we are not only apt to forget the ground we have travelled over but frequently neglect to gather up experience as we go We expend if I may so say the knowledge of every day on the circumstances that produce it and journey on in search of new matter and new refinements but as it is pleasant and sometimes useful to look back even to the first periods of infancy and trace the turns and windings through which we have passed so we may likewise derive many advantages by halting a while in our political career and taking a review of the wonderous complicated labyrinth of little more than yesterday  Truly may we say that never did man grow old in so short a time We have crowded the business of an age into the compass of a few months and have been driven through such a rapid succession of things that for the want of leisure to think we unavoidably wasted knowledge as we  came and have left nearly as much behind us as we brought with us but the road is yet rich with fragments and before we fully lose sight of them will repay us for the trouble of stopping to pick them up  Were a man to be totally deprived of memory he would be incapable of forming any just opinion every thing about him would seem a chaos he would even have his own history to ask from every one and by not knowing how the world went on in his absence he would be at a loss to know how it OUGHT to go on when he recovered or rather returned to it again In like manner though in a less degree a too great inattention to past occurrences retards and bewilders our judgment in every thing while on the contrary by comparing what is past with what is present we frequently hit on the true character of both and become wise with very little trouble It is a kind of countermarch by which we get into the rear of Time and mark the movements and meaning of things as we make our return There are certain circumstances which at the time of their happening are kind of riddles and as every riddle is to be followed by its answer so those kind of circumstances will be followed by their events and those events are always the true solution A considerable space of time may lapse between and unless we continue our observations from the one to the other the  harmony of them will pass away unnoticed but the misfortune is that partly from the pressing necessity of some instant things and partly from the impatience of our tempers we are frequently in such a hurry to make out the meaning of every thing as fast as it happens that we thereby never truly understand it and not only start new difficulties to ourselves by so doing but as it were embarrass Providence in her good designs  I have been civil in stating this fault on a large scale for as it now stands it does not appear to be levelled against any particular set of men but were it to be refined a little further it might afterwards be applied to the Tories with a degree of striking propriety those men have been remarkable for drawing sudden conclusions from single facts The least apparent mishap on our side or the least seeming advantage on the part of the enemy have determined the fate of a whole campaign By this hasty judgment they have converted a retreat into a defeat mistook generalship for error while every little advantage purposely given the enemy either to weaken their strength by dividing it embarrass their councils by multiplying their objects or to secure a greater post by the surrender of a less has been instantly magnified into a conquest Thus by quartering ill policy upon ill principles they have frequently  promoted the cause they designed to injure and injured that which they intended to promote  It is probable the campaign may open before this number comes from the press The enemy have long lain idle and amused themselves with carrying on the war by proclamations only While they continue their delay our strength increases and were they to move to action now it is a circumstantial proof they have no reinforcement coming wherefore in either case the comparative advantage will be ours Like a wounded disabled whale they want only time and room to die in and though in the agony of their exit it may be unsafe to live within the flapping of their tail yet every hour shortens their date and lessens their power of mischief If any thing happens while this Number is in the press it will afford me a subject for the last pages of it At present I am tired of waiting and as neither the enemy nor the state of politics have YET produced any thing new I am thereby left in the field of general matter undirected by any striking or particular object This Crisis therefore will be made up rather of variety than novelty and consist more of things useful than things wonderful  The success of the cause the union of the people and the means of supporting and securing both are points which cannot be too much attended to He who doubts of the former is a desponding coward  and he who wilfully disturbs the latter is a traitor Their characters are easily fixed and under these short descriptions I leave them for the present  One of the greatest degrees of sentimental union which America ever knew was in denying the right of the British Parliament "TO BIND THE COLONIES IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER" The declaration is in its form an almighty one and is the loftiest stretch of arbitrary power that ever one set of men or one country claimed over another Taxation was nothing more than putting the declared right into practice and this failing recourse was had to arms as a means to establish both the right and the practice or to answer a worse purpose which will be mentioned in the course of this Number And in order to repay themselves the expence of an army and to profit by their own injustice the Colonies were by another law declared to be in a state of actual rebellion and of consequence all property therein would fall to the conquerors  The Colonies on their part first denied the right secondly they suspended the use of taxable articles and petitioned against the practice of taxation and these failing they thirdly defended their property by force as soon as it was forcibly invaded and in answer to the declaration of rebellion and nonprotection published their declaration  of Independence and right to selfprotection  These in a few words are the different stages of the quarrel and the parts are so intimately and necessarily connected with each other as to admit of no separation A person to use a trite phrase must be a Whig or a Tory in the lump His feelings as a man may be wounded his charity as a Christian may be moved but his political principles must go through all the cases on one side or the other He cannot be a Whig in  this  stage and a Tory in  that  If he says he is against the United Independence of the Continent he is to all intents and purposes against her in all the rest because THIS LAST comprehends the whole And he may just as well say that Britain was right in declaring us rebels right in taxing us and right in declaring her "RIGHT TO BIND THE COLONIES IN ALL CASES WHATSOEVER" It signifies nothing what neutral ground of his own creation he may skulk upon for shelter for the quarrel in no stage of it hath afforded any such ground and either we or Britain are absolutely right or absolutely wrong through the whole  Britain like a gamester nearly ruined hath now put all her losses into one bet and is playing a desperate game for the total If she win it she wins from me MY life she wins the Continent as the forfeited property of rebels the right of taxing  those that are left as reduced subjects and the power of binding them as slaves And the single die which determines this unparalleled event is whether we support our independence or she overturn it This is coming to the point at once Here is the touchstone to try men by  He that is not a supporter of the independent states of America in the same degree that his religious and political principles would suffer him to support the government of any other country of which he called himself a subject is in the American sense of the word  A TORY  and theinstant that he endeavors to bring his toryism into practice he becomes  A TRAITOR The first man can only be detected by a general test and the law hath already provided for the latter  It is unnatural and impolitic to admit men who would root up our independence to have any share in our legislation either as electors or representatives because the support of our independence rests in a great measure on the vigour and purity of our public bodies Would Britain even in time of peace much less in war suffer an election to be carried by men who professed themselves not to be her subjects or allow such to sit in parliament Certainly not  But there are a certain species of tories with whom conscience or principle hath nothing to do and who are so from avarice only Some of the first fortunes in the continent on the part of the  whigs are staked on the issue of our present measures And shall disaffection only be rewarded with security Can any thing be a greater inducement to a miserly man than the hope of making his mammon safe And though the scheme be fraught with every character of folly yet so long as he supposes that by doing nothing materially criminal against America on one part and by expressing his private disapprobation against independence as a palliative with the enemy on the other part he stands thereby in a safe line between both while I say this ground be suffered to remain craft and the spirit of avarice will point it out and men will not be wanting to fill up this most contemptible of all characters  These men ashamed to own the sordid cause from whence their disaffection springs and thereby add meanness to meanness by endeavouring to shelter themselves under the mask of hypocrisy that is they had rather be thought to be tories from  some kind of principle  than tories by having  no principle at all  But till such time as they can show some real reason natural political or conscientious on which their objections to independence are founded we are not obliged to give them credit for being tories of the first stamp but must set them down as tories of the last  In the second number of the Crisis I endeavoured to shew the impossibility of the enemy making any  conquest of America that nothing was wanting on our part but patience and perseverance and that with these virtues our success as far as human speculation could discern seemed as certain as fate But as there are many among us who influenced by others have regularly gone back from the principles they once held in proportion as we have gone forward and as it is the unfortunate lot of many a good man to live within the neighbourhood of disaffected ones I shall therefore for the sake of confirming the one and recovering the other endeavour in the space of a page or two to go over some of the leading principles in support of independence It is a much pleasanter task to prevent vice than to punish it and however our tempers may be gratified by resentment or our national expences eased by forfeited estates harmony and friendship is nevertheless the happiest condition a country can be blest with  The principal arguments in support of independence may be comprehended under the four following heads  FirstThe natural right of the continent to independence  SecondlyHer interest in being independent  ThirdlyThe necessityand  FourthlyThe moral advantages arising therefrom  I The natural right of the continent to independence is a point which never yet was called in question It will not even admit of a debate To deny such a right would be a kind of atheism against nature And the best answer to fuch an objection would be "  The fool hath said in his heart there is no God  "  II The interest of the continent in being independent is a point as clearly right as the former America by her own internal industty and unknown to all the powers of Europe was at the beginning of the dispute arrived at a pitch of greatness trade and population beyond which it was the interest of Britain not to suffer her to pass lest she should grow too powerful to be kept subordinate She began to view this country with the same uneasy malicious eye with which a covetous guardian would view his ward whose estate he had been enriching himself by for twenty years and saw him just arriving to manhood And America owes no more to Britain for her present maturity than the ward would to his guardian for being twentyone years of age That America hath flourished  at the time  she was under the government of Britain is true but there is every natural reason to believe that had she been an independent country from the first settlement thereof uncontrouled by any foreign power free to make her own laws regulate and encourage her own commerce she had by his  time been of much greater worth than now The case is simply this The first settlers in the different colonies were left to shift for themselves unnoticed and unsupported by any European government but as the tyranny and persecution of the old world daily drove numbers to the new and as by the favor of Heaven on their industry and perseverance they grew into importance so in a like degree they became an object of profit to the greedy eyes of Europe It was impossible in this state of infancy however thriving and promising that they could resist the power of any armed invader that should seek to bring them under his authority In this situation Britain thought it worth her while to claim them and the continent received and acknowledged the claimer It was in reality of no very great importance who was her master seeing that from the force and ambition of the different powers of Europe she must till she acquired strength enough to assert her own right acknowledge some one As well perhaps Britain as another and it might have been as well to have been under the states of Holland as any The same hopes of engrossing and profiting by her trade by not oppressing it too much would have operated alike with any master and produced to the colonies the same effects The clamour of protection likewise was all a farce because in order to make  that  protection necessary she must first by her own  quarrels create us enemies Hard terms indeed  To know whether it be the interest of the continent to be independent we need only ask this easy simple question Is it the interest of a man to be a boy all his life The answer to one will be the answer to both America hath been one continued scene of legislative contention from the first king's representative to the last and this was unavoidably founded in the natural opposition of interest between the old country and the new A governor sent from England or receiving his authority therefrom ought never to have been considered in any other light than that of a genteel commissioned spy whose private business was information and his public business a kind of civilized oppression In the first of these characters he was to watch the tempers sentiments and disposition of the people the growth of trade and the increase of private fortunes and in the latter to suppress all such acts of the assemblies however beneficial to the people which did not directly or indirectly throw some increase of power or profit into the hands of those who sent him  America till now could never be called a  free country  because her legislation depended on the will of a man three thousand miles distant whose interest was in opposition to ours and who by a single "no" could forbid what law he pleased  The freedom of trade likewise is to a trading  country an article of such vast importance that the principal source of wealth depends upon it and it is impossible that any country can flourish as it otherwise might do whose commerce is engrossed cramped and fettered by the laws and mandates of anotheryet these evils and more than I can here enumerate the continent has suffered by being under the government of Great Britain By an independence we clear the whole at onceput an end to the business of unanswered petitions and fruitless remonstrancesexchange Britain for Europe shake hands with the worldlive at peace with mankindand trade to any market where we best can buy and sell  III The necessity likewise of being independent even before it was declared became so evident and important that the continent ran the risk of being ruined every day she delayed it There were reasons to believe that Britain would endeavour to make an European matter of it and rather than lose the whole would dismember it like Poland and dispose of her several claims to the highest bidder Genoa failing in her attempts to reduce Corsica made a sale of it to the French and such traffics have been common in the old world We had at that time no Ambassador in any part of Europe to counteract her negociations and by that means she had the range of every foreign court uncontradicted on our part We even knew nothing of the treaty  for the Hessians till it was concluded and the troops ready to embark Had we been independent before we had probably prevented her obtaining them We had no credit abroad because of our rebellious dependency Our ships could claim no protection in foreign ports because we afforded them no justifiable reason for granting it to us The calling ourselves subjects and at the same time fighting against the power we acknowledged was a dangerous precedent to all Europe If the grievances justified our taking up arms they justified our separation if they did not justify our separation neither could they justify our taking up arms All Europe was interested in reducing us as rebels and all Europe or the greatest part at least is interested in supporting us as independent states At home our condition was still worse Our currency had no foundation and the fall of it would have ruined whig and tory alike We had no other law than a kind of moderated passion no other civil power than an honest mob and no other protection than the temporary attachment of one man to another Had independence been delayed a few months longer this continent would have been plunged into irrecoverable confusion Some violent for it some against it till in the general cabal the rich would have been ruined and the poor destroyed It is to independence that every tory owes the present safety he lives in for by  that  and  that only  we  emerged from a state of dangerous suspense and became a regular people  The necessity likewise of being independent had there been no rupture between Britain and America would in a little time have brought one on The encreasing importance of commerce the weight and perplexity of legislation and the entangled state of European politics would daily have shewn to the continent the impossibility of continuing subordinate for after the coolest reflections on the matter this must be allowed that Britain was too jealous of America to govern it justly too ignorant of it to govern it well and too distant from it to govern it at all  IV But what weigh most with all men of serious reflection are the MORAL ADVANTAGES arising from independence War and desolation are become the trades of the old world and America neither could nor can be under the government of Britain without becoming a sharer of her guilt and a partner in all the dismal commerce of death The spirit of duelling extended on a national scale is a proper character for European wars They have seldom any other motive than pride or any other object than fame The conquerors and the conquered are generally ruined alike and the chief difference at last is that the one marches home with his honours and the other without them 'Tis the natural temper of the  English to fight for a feather if they suppose  that feather  to be an affront and America without the right of asking why must have abetted in every quarrel and abided by its fate It is a shocking situation to live in that one country must be brought into all the wars of another whether the measure be right or wrong or whether she will or not yet this in the fullest extent was and ever would be the unavoidable consequence of the connection Surely the Quakers forgot their own principles when in their late testimony they called  this connection  with these military and miserable appendages hanging to it "  The happy constitution  "  Britain for centuries past has been nearly fifty years out of every hundred at war with some power or other It certainly ought to be a conscientious as well as political consideration with America not to dip her hands in the bloody work of Europe Our situation affords us a retreat from their cabals and the present happy union of the states bids fair for extirpating the future use of arms from one quarter of the world yet such have been the irreligious politics of the present leaders of the Quakers that for the sake of they scarce knew what they would cut off every hope of such a blessing by tying this continent to Britain like Hector to the chariotwheel of Achilles to be dragged through all the miseries of endless European wars  The connection viewed from this ground is distressing to every man who has the feelings of humanity By having Britain for our master we became enemies to the greatest part of Europe and they to us and the consequence was war inevitable By being our own masters independent of any foreign one we have Europe for our friends and the prospect of an endless peace among ourselves Those who were advocates for the British government over these colonies were obliged to limit both their arguments and their ideas to the period of an European peace only The moment Britain became plunged in war every supposed convenience to us vanished away and all we could hope for was  not to be ruined  Could this be a desirable condition for a young country to be in  Had the French pursued their fortune immediately after the defeat of Braddock last war this city and province had then experienced the woeful calamities of being a British subject A scene of the same kind might happen again for America considered as a subject to the crown of Britain would ever have been the seat of war and the bone of contention between the two powers  On the whole if the future expulsion of arms from one quarter of the world be a desirable object to a peaceable manif the freedom of trade to every part of it can engage the attention of a man of businessif the support or fall of millions of  currency can affect our interestif the entire possession of estates by cutting off the lordly claims of Britain over the soil deserves the regard of landed propertyand if the right of making our own laws uncontrouled by royal or ministerial spies or mandates be worthy our care as freementhen are all men interested in the support of independence and may he that supports it not be driven from the blessing and live unpitied beneath the servile sufferings of scandalous subjection  We have been amused with the tales of ancient wonders we have read and wept over the histories of other nations applauded censured or pitied as their cases affected usThe fortitude and patience of the sufferersthe justness of their cause the weight of their oppressions and oppressors the object to be saved or lostwith all the consequences of a defeat or a conquesthave in the hour of sympathy bewitched our hearts and chained it to their fate But where is the power that ever made war upon petitioners Or where is the war on which a world was staked till now  We may not perhaps be wise enough to make all the advantages we ought of our independence but they are nevertheless marked and presented to us with every character of GREAT and GOOD and worthy the hand of Him who sent them I look through the present trouble to a time of tranquility when we shall have it in our power to set  an example of peace to all the world Were the Quakers really impressed and influenced by the quiet principles they profess to hold they would however they might disapprove the means be the first of all men to approve of INDEPENDENCE because by separating from the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah it affords an opportunity never given to man before of carrying their favourite principle of peace into general practice by establishing governments that shall hereafter exist without wars Oh ye fallen cringing priest and Pembertonridden people what more can we say of ye than that a religious Quaker is a valuable character and a political Quaker a real Jesuit  Having thus gone over some of the principal points in support of independence I must now request the reader to return back with me to the period when it first began to be a public doctrine and to examine the progress it has made among the various classes of men The aera I mean to begin at is the breaking out of hostilities April th Until this event happened the continent seemed to view the dispute as a kind of lawsuit for a matter of right litigating between the old country and the new and she felt the same kind and degree of horror as if she had seen an oppressive plantiff at the head of a band of ruffians enter the court while the cause was before it and put the judge the jury the defendant and his council to the  sword Perhaps a more heartfelt convulsion never reached a country with the same degree of power and rapidity before and never may again Pity for the sufferers mixed with indignation at the violence and heightened with apprehensions of undergoing the same fate made the affair of Lexington the affair of the continent Every part of it felt the shock and all vibrated together A general promotion of sentiment took place Those who had drank deeply into whiggish principles that is the right and necessity not only of opposing but wholly setting aside the power of the crown as soon as it became practically dangerous for in theory it was always so stept into the first stage of independence while another class of whigs equally sound in principle but not so sanguine in enterprize attached themselves the stronger to the cause and fell close in with the rear of the former their partition was a mere point Numbers of the moderate men whose chief fault  at that time  arose from their entertaining a better opinion of Britain than she deserved convinced now of their mistake gave her up and publicly declared themselves good whigs While the tories seeing it was no longer a laughing matter either sunk into silent obscurity or contented themselves with coming forth and abusing General Gage Not a single advocate appeared to justify the action of that day it seemed to appear to every one with the same magnitude struck every  one with the same force and created in every one the same abhorrence From this period we may date the growth of independence  If the many circumstances which happened at this memorable time be taken in one view and compared with each other they will justify a conclusion which seems not to be attended to I mean a fixt design in the king and ministry of driving America into arms in order that they might be furnished with a pretence for seizing the whole continent as the immediate property of the crown A noble plunder for hungry courtiers  It ought to be remembered that the first petition from the congress was at this time unanswered on the part of the British king That the motion called Lord North's motion of the th of February arrived in America the latter end of March This motion was to be laid by the several governors then in being before the assembly of each province and the first assembly before which it was laid was the assembly of Pennsylvania in May following This being a just state of the case I then ask why were hostilities commenced between the time of passing the resolve in the house of commons of the th of February and the time of the assemblies meeting to deliberate upon it Degrading and infamous as that motion was there is nevertheless reason to believe that the king and his adherents were afraid the colonies would  agree to it and lest they should took effectual care they should not by provoking them with hostilities in the interim They had not the least doubt at that time of conquering America at one blow and what they expected to get by a conquest being infinitely greater than any thing they could hope to get either by taxation or accommodation they seemed determined to prevent even the possibility of hearing each other lest America should disadpoint their greedy hopes of the whole by listening even to their own terms On the one hand they refufed to hear the petition of the continent and on the other hand took effectual care the continent should not hear them  That the motion of the th of February and the orders for commencing hostilities were both concerted by the same person or persons and not the latter by General Gage as was falsely imagined at first is evident from an extract of a letter of his to administration read among other papers in the house of commons in which he informs his masters  That though their idea of his disarming certain counties was a right one yet it required him to be master of the country in order to enable him to execute it  This was prior to the commencement of hostilities and consequently before the motion of the th of February could be deliberated on by the several assemblies  Perhaps it may be asked why was the motion past if there was at the same time a plan to aggravate the Americans not to listen to it Lord North assigned one reason himself which was  a hope of dividing them  This was publicly tempting them to reject it that if in case the injury of arms should fail of provoking them sufficiently the insult of such a declaration might fill it up But by passing the motion and getting it afterwards rejected in America it enabled them in their wretched idea of politics among other things to hold up the colonies to foreign powers with every possible mark of disobedience and rebellion They had applied to those powers not to supply the continent with arms ammunition c and it was necessary they should incense them against us by assigning on their own part some seeming reputable reason why By dividing it had a tendency to weaken the states and likewise to perplex the adherents of America in England But the principal scheme and that which has marked their character in every part of their conduct was a design of precipitating the colonies into a state which they might afterwards deem rebellion and under that pretence put an end to all future complaints petitions or remonstrances by seizing the whole at once They had ravaged one part of the globe till it could glut them no longer their prodigality required new plunder and through the EastIndia article TEA  they hoped to transfer their rapine from that quarter of the world to thisEvery designed quarrel has its pretence and the same barbarian avarice accompanied the plant to America which ruined the country which produced it  That men never turn rogues without turning fools is a maxim sooner or later universally true The commencement of hostilities being in the beginning of April was of all times the worst chosen The congress were to meet the tenth of May following and the distress the continent felt at this unparalleled outrage gave a stability to that body which no other circumstance could have done It suppressed too all inferior debates and bound them together by a necessitous affection without giving them time to differ upon trifles The suffering likewise softened the whole body of the people into a degree of pliability which laid the principal foundationstone of union order and government and which at any other time might only have fretted and then faded away unnoticed and unimproved But providence who best knows how to time her misfortunes as well as her immediate favors chose this to be the time And who dares dispute it  It did not seem the disposition of the people at this crisis to heap petition upon petition while the former remained unanswered The measure however was carried in congress and a second petition  was sent of which I shall only remark that it was submissive even to a dangerous fault because the prayer of it appealed solely to what it called the prerogative of the crown while the matter in dispute was confessed to be constitutional But even this petition flattering as it was was still not so harmonious as the chink of cash and consequently not sufficiently grateful to the tyrant and his ministry From every circumstance it is evident that it was the determination of the British court to have nothing to do with America but to conquer it fully and absolutely They were certain of success and the field of battle was to be the only place of treaty I am confident there are thousands and tens of thousands in America who wonder now they should ever think otherwise but the sin of that day was the sin of civility yet it operated against our present good in the same manner that a civil opinion of the devil would against our future peace  Independence was a doctrine scarce and rare even towards the conclusion of the year seventyfive All our politics had been founded on the hope or expectation of making the matter upa hope which though general on the side of America had never entered the head or heart of the British court Their hope was conquest and confiscation Good Heavens what volumes of thanks does America owe to Britain What infinite obligations to the  tool that fills with paradoxical vacancy the throne Nothing but the sharpest effence of villainy compounded with the strongest distillation of folly could have produced a menstruum that would have effected a separation The congress in seventyfour administered an abortive medicine to independence by prohibiting the importation of goods and the succeeding congress rendered the dose still more dangerous by continuing it Had independence been a settled system with America as Britain has advanced she ought to have doubled her importation and prohibited in some degree her exportation And this single circumstance is sufficient to acquit America before any jury of nations of having a continental plan of independence in view A charge which had it been true would have been honourable but is so grossly false that either the amazing ignorance or the wilful dishonesty of the British court is effectually proved by it  The second petition like the first produced no answer it was scarcely acknowledged to be received the British court were too determined in their villany even to act it artfully and in their rage for conquest neglected the necessary subtilties for obtaining it They might have divided distracted and played a thousand tricks with us had they been as cunning as they were cruel  This last indignity gave a new spring to independence Those who knew the savage obstinacy of the king and the jobbing gambling spirit of the court predicted the fate of the petition as soon as it was sent from America for the men being known their measures were easily foreseen As politicians we ought not so much to ground our hope on the reasonableness of the thing we ask as on the reasonableness of the person of whom we ask it Who would expect discretion from a fool candor from a tyrant or justice from a villain  As every prospect of accommodation seemed now to fail fast men began to think seriously on the matter and their reason being thus stript of the false hope which had long encompassed it became approachable by fair debate yet still the bulk of the people hesitated they startled at the novelty of independence without once considering that our getting into arms at first was a more extraordinary novelty and that all other nations had gone through the work of independence before us They doubted likewise the ability of the continent to support it without reflecting that it required the same force to obtain an accommodation by arms as an independence If the one was acquirable the other was the same because to accomplish either it was necessary that our strength should be too great for Britain to subdue and it was too unreasonable to suppose that with the power of being masters we  should submit to be servants  In this state of political suspense the pamphlet  Common Sense  made its appearance and the success it met with does not become me to mention Dr Franklin Mr Samuel and John Adams were severally spoken of as the supposed author I had not at that time the pleasure either of personally knowing or being known to the two last gentlemen The favor of Dr Franklin's friendship I possessed in England and my introduction to this part of the world was through his patronage I happened when a school boy to pick up a pleasing natural history of virginia and my inclination from that day of seeing the western side of the Atlantic never left me In October seventyfive Dr Franklin proposed giving me such materials as were in his hands towards completing a history of the present transactions and seemed desirous of having the first volume out the next spring I had then formed the outlines of Common Sense and finished nearly the first part and as I supposed the Doctor's design in getting out a history was to open the new year with a new system I expected to surprise him with a production on that subject much earlier than he thought of and without informing him of what I was doing got it ready for the press as fast as I conveniently could and ent him the first pamphlet that was printed off  Their caution at this time was exceedingly misplaced for if they were able to defend their property and maintain their rights by arms they consequently were able to defend and support their independence and in proportion as these men saw the necessity and righteness of the measure they honestly and openly declared and adopted it and the part they have acted since has done them honour and fully established their characters Error in opinion has this peculiar advantage with it that the foremost point of the contrary ground may at any time be reached by the  sudden exertion of a thought and it frequently happens in sentimental differences that some striking circumstance or some forcible reason quickly conceived will effect in an instant what neither argument nor example could produce in an age  I find it impossible in the small compass I am limited to to trace out the progress which independence has made on the minds of the different classes of men and the several reasons by which they were moved With some it was a passionate abhorrence against the king of England and his ministry as a set of savages and brutes and these men governed by the agony of a wounded mind were for trusting every thing to hope and heaven and bidding defiance at once With others it was a growing conviction that the scheme of the British court was to create ferment and drive on a quarrel for the sake of confiscated plunder Men of this cast ripened into independence in proportion as the evidence increased While a third class conceived it was the true interest of America internally and externally to be her own master gave their support to independence step by step as they saw her abilities to maintain it enlarge With many it was a compound of all these reasons while those who were too callous to be reached by either remained and still remain tories  The legal necessity of being independent with several collateral reasons is pointed out in an elegant  masterly manner in a charge to the grand jury for the district of Charlestown by the Hon William Henry Drayton Esq chief justice of SouthCarolina This performance and the address of the convention of NewYork are pieces in my humble opinion of the first rank in America  The principal causes why independence has not been so universally supported as it ought are fear and indolence and the causes why it has been opposed are  avarice    downright villainy  and  lust of personal power  There is not such a being in America as a tory from conscience some secret defect or other is interwoven in the character of all those be they men or women who can look with patience on the brutality luxury and debauchery of the British court and the violations of their army here A woman's virtue must sit very lightly on her who can even hint a favourable sentiment in their behalf It is remarkable that the whole race of prostitutes in NewYork were tories and the schemes for supporting the tory cause in this city for which several are now in gaol and one hanged were concerted and carried on in common baudyhouses assisted by those who kept them  The connection between vice and meanness is a fit object for satire but when the satire is a fact it cuts with the irresistible power of a diamond If a Quaker in defence of his just rights his property  and the chastity of his house takes up a musket he is expelled the meeting but the present king of England who seduced and took into keeping a sister of their society is reverenced and supported with repeated testimonies while the friendly noodle from whom she was taken and who is now in this city continues a drudge in the service of his rivals as if proud of being cuckolded by a creature called a king  Our support and success depend on such a variety of men and circumstances that every one who does but wish well is of some use There are men who have a strange auk wardness to arms yet have hearts to risk every shilling in the cause or in support of those who have better talents for defending it Nature in the arrangement of mankind has fitted some for every service in life Were all soldiers all would starve and go naked and were none soldiers all would be slaves As disaffection to independence is the badge of a tory so affection to it is the mark of a whig and the different services of the whigs down from those who nobly contribute every thing to those who have nothing to render but their wishes tend all to the same centre though with different degrees of merit and ability The larger we make the circle the more we shall harmonize and the stronger we shall be All we want to shut out is disaffection and that excluded we must accept from each other such duties as we  are best fitted to bestow A narrow system of politics like a narrow system of religion is calculated only to sour the temper and live at variance with mankind  All we want to know in America is simply this who is for independence and who is not Those who are for it will support it and the remainder will undoubtedly see the reasonableness of their paying the charges while those who oppose or seek to betray it must expect the more rigid fate of the gaol and the gibbet There is a bastard kind of generosity which by being extended to all men is as fatal to society on one hand as the want of true generosity is on the other A lax manner of administering justice falsely termed moderation has a tendency both to dispirit public virtue and promote the growth of public evils Had the late committee of safety taken cognizance of the last testimony of the Quakers and proceeded against such delinquents as were concerned therein they had probably prevented the treasonable plans which have been concerted since When one villain is suffered to escape it encourages another to proceed either from a hope of escaping likewise or an apprehension that we dare not punish It has been a matter of general surprise that no notice was taken of the incendiary publication of the Quakers of the th of November last a publication evidently intended to promote sedition and treason and encourage the  enemy who were then within a day's march of this city to proceed on and possess it I here present the reader with a memorial which was laid before the board of safety a few days after the testimony appeared Not a member of that board that I conversed with but expressed the highest detestation of the perverted principles and conduct of the Quaker junto and that the board would take the matter up notwithstanding which it was suffered to pass away unnoticed to the encouragement of new acts of treason the general danger of the cause and the disgrace of the state  To the honourable the council of safety of the state of Pennsylvania  At a meeting of a reputable number of the inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia impressed with a proper sense of the justice of the cause which this continent is engaged in and animated with a generous fervor for supporting the same it was resolved that the following be laid before the board of safety  "We profess liberality of sentiment to all men with this distinction only that those who do not deserve it would become wise and seek to deserve it We hold the pure doctrine of universal liberty of conscience and conceive it our duty to endeavour  to secure that sacred right to others as well as to defend it for ourselves for we undertake not to judge of the religious rectitude of tenets but leave the whole matter to Him who made us  "We persecute no man neither will we abet in the persecution of any man for religion sake our common relation to others being that of fellow citizens and fellowsubjects of one civil community and in this line of connection we hold out the right hand of fellowship to all men But we should conceive ourselves to be unworthy members of the FREE and INDEPENDENT STATES OF AMERICA were we unconcernedly to see or suffer any treasonable wound public or private directly or indirectly to be given against the peace and safety of the same We enquire not into the rank of the offenders nor their religious persuasion we have no business with either our part being only to find them out and exhibit them to justice  "A printed paper dated the th of November and signed "  John Pemberton  " whom we suppose to be an inhabitant of this city has lately been dispersed abroad a copy of which accompanies this Had the framers and publishers of that paper conceived it their duty to exhort the youth and others of their society to a patient submission under the present trying visitations and humbly to wait the event of heaven towards them they had therein shewn a Christian temper and we had been silent  but the anger and political virulence with which their instructions are given and the abuse with which they stigmatize all ranks of men not thinking like themselves leave no doubt on our minds from what spirit their publication proceeded And it is disgraceful to the pure cause of truth that men can dally with words of the most sacred import and play them as mechanically off as if religion consisted only in contrivance We know of no instance in which the Quakers have been compelled to bear arms or do any thing which might strain their conscience wherefore their advice "to withstand and refuse to admit to the arbitrary instructions and ordinances of men" appear to us a false alarm and could only be treasonably calculated to gain favour with our enemies when they were seemingly on the brink of invading this state or what is still worse to weaken the hands of our defence that their entrance into this city might be made practical and easy  "We disclaim all tumult and disorder in the punishment of offenders and wish to be governed not by temper but by reason in the manner of treating them We are sensible that our cause has suffered by the two following errors first by illjudged lenity to traiterous persons in some cases and secondly by only a passionate treatment of them in others For the future we disown both  and wish to be steady in our proceedings and serious in our punishments  "Every state in America has by the repeated voice of its inhabitants directed and authorized the continental congress to publish a formal declaration of independence of and separation from the oppressive king and parliament of great Britain and we look on every man an enemy who does not in some line or other give his assistance towards supporting the same at the same time we consider the offence to be heightened to a degree of unpardonable guilt when such persons under the shew of religion endeavour either by writing speaking or otherwise to subvert overturn or bring reproach upon the independence of this continent as declared by congress  "The publishers of the paper signed "John Pemberton" have called in a loud and passionate manner on their friends and connections "to withstand and refuse" obedience to whatever "instructions or ordinances" may be published not warranted by what they call "that happy constitution under which they and others long enjoyed tranquillity and peace" If this be not treason we know not what may properly be called by that name  "To us it is a matter of surprise and astonishment that men with the word "peace peace" continually on their lips should be so fond of living  under and supporting a government and at the same time calling it "happy" which is never better pleased than when at warthat hath filled India with carnage and famineAfrica with slavery and tampered with Indians and Negroes to cut the throats of the freemen of America We conceive it a disgrace to this state to harbour or wink at such palpable hypocrisy But as we seek not to hurt the hair of any man's head when we can make ourselves safe without we wish such persons to restore peace to themselves and us by removing themselves to some part of the king of Great Britain's dominions as by that means they may live unmolested by us or we by them for our fixed opinion is that those who do not deserve a place among us ought not to have one  "We conclude with requesting the council of safety to take into their consideration the paper signed "John Pemberton and if it shall appear to them to be of a dangerous tendency or of a treasonable nature that they would commit the signer together with such other persons as they can discover were concerned therein into custody until such time as some mode of trial shall ascertain the full degree of their guilt and punishment in the doing of which we wish their judges whoever they may be to disregard the man his connections interest riches poverty or principles of religion and to attend to the nature of his offence only"  THE most cavilling sectarian cannot accuse the foregoing with containing the least ingredient of persecution The free spirit on which the American cause is founded disdains to mix with such an impurity and leave it a rubbish fit only for narrow and suspicious minds to grovel in Suspicion and persecution are weeds of the same dunghill and flourish best together Had the Quakers minded their religion and their business they might have lived through this dispute in enviable ease and none would have molested them The common phrase with these people is "  Our principles are peace  " To which may be replied  and your practices are the reverse  for never did the conduct of men oppose their own doctrine more notoriously than the present race of the Quakers They have artfully changed themselves into a different sort of people to what they used to be and yet have the address to persuade each other they are not altered like antiquated virgins they see not the havoc deformity hath made upon them but pleasantly mistaking wrinkles for dimples conceit themselves yet lovely and wonder at the stupid world for not admiring them  Did no injury arise to the public by this apostacy of the Quakers from themselves the public would have nothing to do with it but as both the design and consequences are pointed against a cause in which the whole community are interested it is  therefore no longer a subject confined to the cognizance of the meeting only but comes as a matter of criminality before either the authority of the particular state  in which  it is acted or of the continent  against which  it operates Every attempt now to support the authority of the king and parliament of Great Britain over America is treason against  every  state therefore it is impossible that any  one  can pardon or screen from punishment an offender against  all  But to proceed While the infatuated tories of this and other states were last spring talking of commissioners accommodation making the matter up and the Lord knows what stuff and nonsense their  good  king and ministry were glutting themselves with the revenge of reducing America to  unconditional submission  and solacing each other with the certainty of conquering it in  one campaign  The following quotations are from the parliamentary register of the debates of the house of lords March th  "The Americans" says Lord  Talbot  Steward of the king's houshold  "have been obstinate undutiful and ungovernable from the very beginning from their first early and infant settlements and I am every day more and more convinced that this people will never be brought back to their duty and the subordinate relation they  stand in to this country till  reduced to an unconditional effectual submission    no concession on our part    no lenity    no endurance  will have any other effect but that of increasing their insolence"  "The struggle" says Lord  Townsend  Formerly General Townsend at Quebec and late Lord Lieutenant of Ireland  "is now a struggle for power the die is cast and the ONLY POINT which now remains to be determined is in what manner the war can be most effectually prosecuted and speedily finished in order to procure that  unconditional submission  which has been so able stated by the noble Earl with the white staff meaning lord Talbot and I have no reason to doubt that the measures now pursuing will put an end to the war in the course of a SINGLE CAMPAIGN Should it linger longer we shall then have reason to expect that some foreign power will interfere and take advantage of our domestic troubles and civil distractions"  Lord  Littleton  "My sentiments are pretty well known I shall only observe now that lenient measures have had no other effect than to produce insult after insult that the more we conceded the higher America rose in her demands and the more insolent she has grown It is for this reason that I am now for the most effective and decisive measures and am of opinion that no alternative  is left us but to relinquish America for ever or finally determine to compel her to acknowledge the legislative authority of this country and it is the principle of an  unconditional submission  I would be for maintaining"  Can words be more expressive than these Surely the tories will believe the tory lords The truth is they  do believe them  and know as fully as any whig on the continent knows that the king and ministry never had the least design of an accommodation with America but an absolute unconditional conquest And the part which the tories were to act was by downright lying to endeavour to put the continent off its guard and to divide and sow discontent in the minds of such whigs as they might gain an influence over In short to keep up a distraction here that the force sent from England might be able to conquer in "  one campaign  " They and the ministry were by a dsifferent game playing into each others hands The cry of the tories in England was "  No reconciliation no accommodation  " in order to obtain the greater military force while those in America were crying nothing but "  reconciliation and accommodation  " that the force sent might conquer with the less resistance  But  this  "  single campaign  " is over and America not conquered The whole work is yet to do and the force much less to do it with Their condition  is both despicable and deplorable Out of cashout of heart and out of hope A country furnished with arms and ammunition as America now is with three millions of inhabitants and three thousand miles distant from the nearest enemy that can approach her is able to look and laugh them in the face  Howe appears to have two objects in view either to go up the Northriver or come to Philadelphia By going up the Northriver he secures a retreat for his army through Canada but the ships must return if they return at all the same way they went and as our army would be in the rear the safety of their passage down is a doubtful matter By such a motion he shuts himself from all supplies from Europe but through Canada and exposes his army and navy to the danger of perishing The idea of his cutting off the communication between the eastern and southern states by means of the Northriver is merely visionary He cannot do it by his shipping because no ship can lay long at anchor in any river within reach of the shore a single gun would drive a first rate from such a station This was fully proved last October at fort Washington and Lee where one gun only on each side the river obliged two frigates to cut and be towed off in an hour's time Neither can he cut it off by his army because the several posts they  must occupy would divide them almost to nothing and expose them to be picked up by ours like pebbles on a river's bank but admitting he could where is the injury Because while his whole force is cantoned out as centries over the water they will be very innocently employed and the moment they march into the country the communication opens  The most probable object is Philadelphia and the reasons are many Howe's business in America is to conquer it and in proportion as he finds himself unable to the task he will employ his strength to distress women and weak minds in order to accomplish through  their  fears what he cannot effect by his  own  force His coming or attempting to come to Philadelphia is a circumstance that proves his weakness For no general that felt himself able to take the field and attack his antagonist would think of bringing his army into a city in the summer time and this mere shifting the scene from place to place without effecting any thing has feebleness and cowardice on the face of it and holds him up in a contemptible light to any one who can reason justly and firmly By several informations from New York it appears that their army in general both officers and men have given up the expectation of conquering America their eye now is fixt upon the spoil They suppose Philadelphia  to be rich with stores and as they think to get more by robbing a town than by attacking an army their movement towards this city is probable We are not now contending against an army of soldiers but against a band of thieves who had rather plunder than fight and have no other hope of conquest than by cruelty  They expect to get a mighty booty and strike another general panic by making a sudden movement and getting possession of this city but unless they can march  out  as well as  in  or get the entire command of the river to remove off their plunder they may probably be stopt with the stolen goods upon them They have never yet succeeded wherever they have been opposed but at fort Washington At Charleston their defeat was effectual At Ticonderoga they ran away In every skirmish at Kingsbridge and the WhitePlains they were obliged to retreat and the instant our arms were turned upon them in the Jerseys they turned likewise and those that turned not were taken  The necessity of always fitting our internal police to the circumstances of the times we live in is something so strikingly obvious that no sufficient objection can be made against it The safety of all societies depend upon it and where this point is not attended to the consequences will either be a  general languor or a tumult The encouragement and protection of the good subjects of any state and the suppression and punishment of bad ones are the principal objects for which all authority is instituted and the line in which it ought to operate We have in this city a strange variety of men and characters and the circumstances of the times require they should be publicly known it is not the number of tories that hurt us so much as the not finding out who they are men must now take one side or the other and abide by the consequences The quakers trusting to their shortsighted sagacity have most unluckily for them made their declaration in their last testimony and we ought  now  to take them at their word They have voluntarily read themselves out of the continental meeting and cannot hope to be restored to it again but by payment and penitence Men whose political principles are founded on avarice are beyond the reach of reason and the only cure of toryism of this cast is to tax it A substantial good drawn from a real evil is of the same benefit to society as if drawn from a virtue and where men have not public spirit to render themselves serviceable it ought to be the study of government to draw the best use possible from their vices When the governing passion of any man or set of men is once known the method of managing them is  easy for even misers whom no public virtue can impress would become generous could a heavy tax be laid upon covetousness  The tories have endeavoured to insure their property with the enemy by forfeiting their reputation with us from which may be justly inferred that their governing passion is avarice Make them as much afraid of losing on one side as the other and you stagger their toryism make them more so and you reclaim them for their principle is to worship any power they are most afraid of  This method of considering men and things together opens into a large field for speculation and affords me opportunity of offering some observations on the state of our currency so as to make the support of it go hand in hand with the suppression of disaffection and the encouragement of public spirit  The thing which first presents itself in inspecting the state of the currency is that we have too much of it and that there is a necessity of reducing the quantity in order to increase the value Men are daily growing poor by the very means they take to get rich for in the same proportion that the prices of all goods on hand are raised the value of all money laid by is reduced A simple case will make this clear Let a man have one hundred pounds cash and as many goods on hand as will today sell  for l but not content with the present market price he raises them to and by so doing obliges others in their own defence to raise cent per cent likewise in this case it is evident that his hundred pounds laid by is reduced fifty pounds in value whereas had the markets dropt cent per cent his goods would have sold but for ten but his hundren pounds would have risen in value to two hundred because it would then purchase as many goods again or support his family as long again as before And strange as it may seem he is one hundred and fifty pounds the poorer for raising his goods to what he would have been had he lowered them because the forty pounds his goods sold for is by the general rise of the markets cent per cent rendered of no more value than the ten pounds would be had the market fallen in the same proportion and consequently the whole difference of gain or loss is on the different values of the hundred pounds laid by viz from fifty to two hundred This rage for raising goods is for several reasons much more the fault of the tories than the whigs and yet the tories to their shame and confusion ought they to be told of it are by far the most noisy and discontented The greatest part of the whigs by being now either in the army or employed in some public service are  buyers  only and not  sellers  and as  this evil has its origin in trade it cannot be charged on those who are out of it  But the grievance is now become too general to be remedied by partial methods and the only effectual cure is to reduce the quantity of money with half the quantity we should be richer than we are now because the value of it would be doubled and consequently our attachment to it increased for it is not the number of dollars a man has but how far they will go that makes him either rich or poor  These two points being admitted viz that the quantity of money is too great and that the prices of goods can be only effectually reduced by reducing the quantity of the money the next point to be considered is the method how to reduce it  The circumstances of the times as before observed require that the public characters of all men should  now  be fully understood and the only general method of ascertaining it is by an oath or affirmation renouncing all allegiance to the king of Great Britain and to support the independency of the United States as declared by Congress Let at the same time a tax of ten fifteen or twenty per cent per annum to be collected quarterly be levied on all property These alternatives by being perfectly voluntary will take in all sorts of people Here is the test here is the tax He who takes the former conscientiously proves his affection to  the cause and binds himself to pay his quota by the best  services  in his power and is thereby justly exempt from the latter and those who chuse the latter pay their quota in money to be excused from taking the former or rather 'tis the price paid to us for their supposed though mistaken insurance with the enemy  But this is only a part of the advantage which would arise by knowing the different characters of men The whigs stake every thing on the issue of their arms while the tories by their disaffection are sapping and undermining their strength and of consequence the property of the whigs is the more exposed thereby and whatever injury their estates may sustain by the movements of the enemy must either be borne by themselves who have done every thing which has  yet  been done or by the tories who have not only done nothing but have by their disaffection invited the enemy on  In the present crisis we ought to know square by square and house by house who are in real allegiance with the United Independent States and who are not Let but the line be made clear and distinct and all men will then know what they are to trust to It would not only be good policy but strict justice to raise fifty or a hundred thousand pounds or more if it is necessary out of the estates and property of the king of England's votaries resident  in Philadelphia to be distributed as a reward to those inhabitants of the city and state who should turn out and repulse the enemy should they attempt their march this way and likewise to bind the property of all such persons to make good the damages which that of the whigs might sustain In the undistinguishable mode of conducting a war we frequently make reprisals at sea on the vessels of persons in England who are friends to our cause compared with the residentary tories among us  In every former publication of mine from Common sense down to the last Crisis I have generally gone on the charitable supposition that the tories were rather a mistaken than a criminal people and have applied argument after argument with all the candor and temper I was capable of in order to set every part of the case clearly and fairly before them and if possible to reclaim them from ruin to reason I have done my duty by them and have now done with that doctrine taking it for granted that those who yet hold their disaffection are either a set of avaricious miscreants who would sacrifice the continent to save themselves or a banditti of hungry traitors who are hoping for a division of the spoil To which may be added a list of crown or proprietary dependants who rather than go without a portion of power would be content to share it with the devil Of such men there is no  hope and their obedience will only be according to the danger that is set before them and the power that is exercised over them  A time will shortly arrive in which by ascertaining the characters of persons now we shall be guarded against their mischiefs then so in proportion as the enemy despair of conquest they will be trying the arts of seduction and the force of fear by all the mischiefs they can inflict But in war we may be certain of these two things viz that cruelty in an enemy and motions made with more than usual parade are always signs of weakness He that can conquer finds his mind too free and pleasant to be brutish and he that intends to conquer never makes too much show of his strength  We now know the enemy we have to do with While drunk with the certainty of victory they disdained to be civil and in proportion as disappointment makes them sober and their apprehensions of an European war alarm them they will become cringing and artful honest they cannot be  But our answer to them in either condition they may be in is short and full "As free and independent states we are willing to make peace with you tomorrow but we can neither hear nor reply in any other character"  If Britain cannot conquer us it proves that she is neither able to govern or protect us and our particular situation now is such that any connexion with her would be unwisely exchanging a half defeated enemy for two powerful ones Europe by every appearance and information is now on the eve nay on the morning twilight of a war and any alliance with  George the Third  brings  France  and  Spain  upon our backs a separation from him attach them to our side therefore the only road to  peace    honour  and commerce is INDEPENDENCE  Written this fourth year of the UNION  which  GOD  preserve  THE CRISIS  No IV  Philadelphia  Sept  THOSE who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must like men undergo the fatigues of supporting it The event of Yesterday is one of those kind of alarms which is just sufficient to rouse us to duty without being of consequence enough to depress our fortitude It is not a field of a few acres of ground but a cause we are defending and whether we defeat the enemy in one battle or by degrees the consequence will be the same  Look back at the events of last winter and the present year there you will find that the enemy's successes have always contributed to reduce them What they have gained in ground they paid so dearly for in numbers that their victories have in the end amounted to defeats We have always been masters at the last push and always shall while we do our duty Howe has been once on the banks of the Delaware and from thence driven back with loss and disgrace and why not be again driven from the Schuylkill His condition and  ours are very different He has every body to fight we have only his  one  army to cope with and which wastes away at every engagement we can not only reinforce but can redouble our numbers he is cut off from all supplies and must sooner or later inevitably fall into our hands  Shall a band of ten or twelve thousand robbers who are this day fifteen hundred or two thousand men less in strength than they were yesterday conquer America or subdue even a single state The thing cannot be unless we sit down and suffer them to do it Another such a brush notwithstanding we lost the ground would by still reducing the enemy put them in a condition to be afterwards totally defeated  Could our whole army have come up to the attack at one time the consequences had probably been otherwise but our having different parts of the Brandywinecreek to guard and the uncertainty which road to Philadelphia the enemy would attempt to take naturally afforded them an opportunity of passing with their main body at a place where only a part of ours could be posted for it must strike every thinking man with conviction that it requires a much greater force to oppose an enemy in several places than is sufficient to defeat in any one place  Men who are sincere in defending their freedom will always feel concern at every circumstance which seems to make against them it is the natural and honest consequence of all affectionate attachments and the want of it is a vice But the dejection lasts only for a moment they soon rise out of it with additional vigour the glow of hope courage and fortitude will in a little time supply the place of every inferior passion and kindle the whole heart into heroism  There is a mystery in the countenance of some causes which we have not always present judgment enough to explain It is distressing to see an enemy advancing into a country but it is the only place in which we can beat them and in which we have always beaten them whenever they made the attempt The nearer any disease approaches to a crisis the nearer it is to a cure Danger and deliverance make their advances together and it is only the last push that one or the other takes the lead  There are many men who will do their duty when it is not wanted but a genuine public spirit always appear most when there is most occasion for it Thank God our army though fatigued is yet entire The attack made by us yesterday was under many disadvantages naturally arising from the uncertainty of knowing which route the enemy would take and from that circumstance the whole of our force could not be brought up together  time enough to engage all at once Our strength is yet reserved and it is evident that Howe does not think himself a gainer by the affair otherwise he would this morning have moved down and attacked General Washington  Gentlemen of the city and country it is in your power by a spirited improvement of the present circumstance to turn it to a real advantage Howe is now weaker than before and every shot will contribute to reduce him You are more immediately interested than any other part of the continent your all is at a stake it is not so with the general cause you are devoted by the enemy to plunder and destruction It is the encouragement which Howe the chief of plunderers has promised his army Thus circumstanced you may save yourselves by a manly resistance but you can have no hope in any other conduct I never yet knew our brave general or any part of the army officers or men out of heart and I have seen them in circumstances a thousand times more trying than the present It is only those that are not in action that feel languor and heaviness and the best way to rub it off is to turn out and make sure work of it  Our army must undoubtedly feel fatigue and want a reinforcement of rest though not of valour Our own interest and happiness call upon us to give them every support in our power and make the  burden of the day on which the safety of this city depends light as possible Remember gentlemen that we have forces both to the northward and southward of Philadelphia and if the enemy be but stopt till those can arrive this city will be saved and the enemy finally routed You have too much at stake to hesitate You ought not to think an hour on the matter but to spring to action at once Other states have been invaded have likewise driven off the invaders Now our time and turn is come and perhaps the finishing stroke is reserved for us When we look back on the dangers we have been saved from and reflect on the success we have been blessed with it would be sinful either to be idle or despair  I close this paper with a short address to General Howe You sir are only lingering out the period that shall bring with it your defeat You have yet scarce began upon the war and the farther you enter the faster will your troubles thicken What you now enjoy is only a respite from ruin an invitation to destruction something that will lead on to our deliverance at your expence We know the cause we are engaged in and though a passionate fondness for it may make us grieve at every injury that threatens it yet when the moment of concern is over the determination to duty returns We are not moved by the gloomy smile of a worthless  king but by the ardent glow of generous patriotism We fight not to enslave but to set a country free and to make room upon the earth for honest men to live in In such a cause we are sure we are right and we leave to you the despairing reflection of being the tool of a miserable tyrant  THE CRISIS  No VI  To General Sir William Howe  TO argue with a man who has renounced the use and authority of reason and whose philosophy consists in holding humanity in contempt is like administering medicines to the dead or endeavouring to convert an atheist by scripture Enjoy sir your insensibility of feeling and reflecting It is the prerogative of animals And no man will envy you those honours in which a savage only can be your rival and a bear your master  As the generosity of this country rewarded your brother's services last war with an elegant monument in Westminster Abbey it is consistent that she should bestow some mark of distinction upon you You certainly deserve her notice and a conspicuous place in the catalogue of extraordinary persons Yet it would be a pity to pass you from the world in state and consign you to magnificent oblivion among the tombs without telling the future  beholder why Judas is as much known as John yet history ascribes their fame to very different actions  Sir William hath undoubtedly merited a monument But of what kind or of what inscription where placed or how embellished is a question that would puzzle all the heralds of St James's in the profoundest mood of historical deliberation We are at no loss sir to ascertain your real character but somewhat perplexed how to perpetuate its identity and preserve it uninjured from the transformations of time or mistake A statuary may give a false expression to your bust or decorate it with some equivocal emblems by which you may happen to steal into reputation and impose upon the hereafter traditionary world Ill nature or ridicule may conspire or a variety of accidents combine to lessen enlarge or change Sir William's fame and no doubt but he who has taken so much pains to be singular in his conduct would choose to be as singular in his exit his monument and his epitaph  The usual honours of the dead to be sure are not sufficiently sublime to escort a character like you to the republic of dust and ashes for however men may differ in their ideas of grandeur or government here the grave is nevertheless a perfect republic Death is not the monarch of the  dead but of the dying The moment he obtains a conquest he loses a subject and like the foolish king you serve will in the end war himself out of all dominion  As a proper preliminary towards the arrangement of your funeral honours we readily admit your new rank of  knighthood  The title is perfectly in character and is your own more by merit than creation There are knights of various orders from the knight of the windmill to the knight of the post The former is your patron for exploits and the latter will assist you in settling your accounts No honourary title could be more happily applied The ingenuity is sublime And your royal master hath discovered more genius in fitting you therewith than in generating the most finished figure for a button or descanting on the properties of a button mould  But how sir shall we dispose of you The invention of a statuary is exhausted and Sir William is yet unprovided with a monument America is anxious to bestow her funeral favours upon you and wishes to do it in a manner that shall distinguish you from all the deceased heroes of the last war The  Egyptian method of embalming  is not known to the present age and hieroglyphical pageantry hath out lived the science of decyphering it Some other method therefore must be thought of to  immortalize the new knight of the windmill and post Sir William thanks to his stars is not oppressed with very delicate ideas He has no ambition of being wrapt up and handed about in myrrh aloes and cassia Less chargeable odours will suffice and it fortunately happens that the simple genius of America hath discovered the art of preserving bodies and embellishing them too with much greater frugality than the ancients In a balmage sir of humble tar you will be as secure as Pharoah and in a hieroglyphic of feathers rival in finery all the mummies of Egypt  As you have already made your exit from the moral world and by numberless acts both of passionate and deliberate injustice engraved an "  Here Lyeth  " on your deceased honour it must be mere affectation in you to pretend concern at the humours or opinions of mankind respecting you What remains of you may expire at any time The sooner the better For he who survives his reputation lives out of spite to himself like a man listening to his own reproach  Thus entombed and ornamented I leave you to the inspection of the curious and return to the history of your yet surviving actionsThe character of Sir William hath undergone some extraordinary revolutions since his arrival in America It is now fixed and known and we have nothing  to hope from your candour or to fear from your capacity Indolence and inability have too large a share in your composition ever to suffer you to be any thing more than the hero of little villanies and unfinished adventures That which to some persons appeared moderation in you at first was not produced by any real virtue of your own but by a contrast of passions dividing and holding you in perpetual irresolution One vice will frequently expel another without the least merit in the man as powers in contrary directions reduce each other to rest  It became you to have supported a dignified solemnity of character to have shewn a superior liberality of soul to have won respect by an obstinate perseverance in maintaining order and to have exhibited on all occasions such an unchangeable graciousness of conduct that while we beheld in you the resolution of an enemy we might admire in you the sincerity of a man You came to America under the high sounding titles of commander and commissioner not only to suppress what you called rebellion by arms but to shame it out of countenance by the excellence of your example Instead of which you have been the patron of low and vulgar frauds the encourager of Indian cruelties and have imported a cargo of vices blacker than those you pretend to suppress  Mankind are not universally agreed in their determination of right and wrong but there are certain actions which the consent of all nations and individuals hath branded with the unchangeable name of MEANNESS In the list of human vices we find some of such a refined constitution that they cannot be carried into practice without seducing some virtue to their assistance but  meanness  hath neither alliance nor apology It is generated in the dust and sweepings of other vices and is of such a hateful figure that all the rest conspire to disown it Sir William the commissioner of George the Third hath at last vouchsafed to give it rank and pedigree He has placed the fugitive at the council board and dubbed it companion of the order of knighthood  The particular act of meanness which I allude to in this description is forgery You sir have abetted and patronized the forging and uttering counterfeit continental bills In the same NewYork newspapers in which your own proclamation under your master's authority was published offering or pretending to offer pardon and protection to the inhabitants of these states there were repeated advertisements of counterfeit money for sale and persons who have come officially from you and under sanction of your flag have been taken up in attempting to put them off  A conduct so basely mean in a public character is without precedent or pretence Every nation on earth whether friends or enemies will unite in despising you 'Tis an incendiary war upon society which nothing can excuse or palliateAn improvement upon beggarly villanyand shews an inbred wretchedness of heart made up between the venomous malignity of a serpent and the spiteful imbecility of an inferior reptile  The laws of any civilized country would condemn you to the gibbet without regard to your rank or titles because it is an action foreign to the usage and custom of war and should you fall into our hands which pray God you may it will be a doubtful matter whether we are to consider you as a military prisoner or a prisoner for felony  Besides it is exceedingly unwise and impolitic in you or any persons in the English service to promote or even encourage or wink at the crime of forgery in any case whatever Because as the riches of England as a nation are chiefly in paper and the far greater part of trade among individuals is carried on by the same medium that is by notes and drafts on one another they therefore of all people in the world ought to endeavour to keep forgery out of sight and if possible not to revive the idea of it It is dangerous to make men familiar with a crime which they may afterwards  practise to much greater advantage against those who first taught them Several officers in the English army have made their exit at the gallows for forgery on their agents for we all know who know any thing of England that there is not a more necessitous body of men taking them generally than what the English officers are They contrive to make a shew at the expence of the taylor and appear clean at the charge of the washerwoman  England hath at this time nearly two hundred million pounds sterling of public money in paper for which she hath no real property besides a large circulation of bank notes bank post bills and promissory notes and drafts of private bankers merchants and tradesmen She hath the greatest quantity of paper currency and the least quantity of gold and silver of any nation in Europe the real specie which is about sixteen millions sterling serve only as change in large sums which are always made in paper or for payment in small ones Thus circumstanced the nation is put to its wit's end and obliged to be severe almost to criminality to prevent the practice and growth of forgery Scarcely a session passes at the Old Bailey or an execution at Tyburn but witnesseth this truth Yet you sir regardless of the policy which her necessity obliges her to adopt have made your whole  army intimate with the crime And as all armies at the conclusion of a war are too apt to carry into practice the vices of the campaign it will probably happen that England will hereafter abound in forgeries to which art the practitioners were first initiated under your authority in America You sir have the honour of adding a new vice to the military catalogue and the reason perhaps why the invention was reserved for you is because no general before was mean enough even to think of it  That a man whose soul is absorbed in the low traffic of vulgar vice is incapable of moving in any superior region is clearly shewn in you by the event of every campaign Your military exploits have been without plan object or decision Can it be possible that you or your employers can suppose the possession of Philadelphia to be any ways equal to the expence or expectation of the nation which supports you What advantages does England derive from any achievements of yours To  her  it is perfectly indifferent what place you are in so long as the business of conquest is unperformed and the charge of maintaining you remains the same  If the principal events of the three campaigns be attended to the balance will appear strongly against you at the close of each but the last in point of importance to us hath exceeded the former two  It is pleasant to look back on dangers past and equally as pleasant to meditate on present ones when the way out begins to appear  That  period is now arrived and the long doubtful winter of war is changing to the sweeter prospects of victory and joy At the close of the campaign in seventyfive you were obliged to retreat from Boston In the summer of seventysix you appeared with a numerous fleet and army in the harbour of New York By what miracle the Continent was preserved in that season of danger is a subject of admiration If instead of wasting your time against Long Island you had run up the North River and landed any where above New York the consequence must have been that either you would have compelled General Washington to fight you with very unequal numbers or he must have suddenly evacuated the city with the loss of nearly all the stores of the army or have surrendered for the want of provisions the situation of the place naturally producing one or other of these events  The preparations made to defend New York were nevertheless wise and military because your forces were then at sea their numbers uncertain storms sickness or variety of accidents might have disabled their coming or so diminished them on their passage that those which survived would have been incapable of opening the campaign with  any prospect of success in which case the defence would have been sufficient and the place preserved for cities that have been raised from nothing with an infinitude of labour and expence are not to be thrown away on the bear probability of their being taken On these grounds the preparations made to maintain New York were as judicious as the retreat afterwards While you in the interim let slip the  very  opportunity which seemed to put conquest in your power  Through the whole of that campaign you had nearly double the forces which General Washington immediately commanded The principal plan at that time on our part was to wear away the season with as little loss as possible and to raise the army for the next year LongIsland NewYork Forts Washington and Lee were not defended after your superior force was known under any expectation of their being finally maintained but as a range of out works in the attacking of which your time might be wasted your numbers reduced and your vanity amused by possessing them on our retreat It was intended to have withdrawn the garrison from Fort Washington after it had answered the former of those purposes but the fate of that day put a prize into your hands without much honour to yourselves  Your progress through the Jersesy was accidental you had it not even in contemplation or you would not have sent so principal a part of your force to Rhode Island before hand The utmost hope of America in the year seventy six reached no higher than that she might not  then  be conquered She had no expectation of defeating you in that campaign Even the most cowardly tory allowed that could she withstand the shock of  that  summer her independence would be past a doubt You had  then  greatly the advantage of her You were formidable Your military knowledge was supposed to be complete Your fleets and forces arrived without an accident You had neither experience nor reinforcements to wait for You had nothing to do but to begin and your chance lay in the first vigorous onset  America was young and unskilled She was obliged to trust her defence to time and practice and hath by mere dint of perseverance maintained her cause and brought her enemy to a condition in which she is now capable of meeting him on any grounds  It is remarkable in the campaign of seventysix you gained no more notwithstanding your great force than what was given you by consent of evacuation except Fort Washington while every advantage obtained by us was by fair and hard fighting The defeat of Sir Peter Parker was  complete The conquest of the Hessians at Trenton by the remains of a retreating army which but a few days before you affected to despise is an instance of heroic perseverance very seldom to be met with And the victory over the British troops at Princetown by a harrassed and wearied party who had been engaged the day before and marched all night without refreshment is attended with such a scene of circumstances and superiority of generalship as will ever give it a place on the first line in the history of great actions  When I look back on the gloomy days of last winter and see America suspended by a thread I feel a triumph of joy at the recollection of her delivery and a reverence for the characters which snatched her from destruction To doubt  now  would be a species of infidelity and to forget the instruments which saved us  then  would be ingratitude  The close of that campaign left us with the spirits of conquerors The northern districts were relieved by the retreat of General Carleton over the lakes The army under your command were hunted back and had their bounds prescribed The Continent began to feel its military importance and the winter passed pleasantly away in preparations for the next campaign  However confident you might be on your first arrival the course of the year seventy six gave  you some idea of the difficulty if not impossibility of conquest To this reason I ascribe your delay in opening the campaign in seventy seven The face of matters on the close of the sormer year gave you no encouragement to pursue a discretionary war as soon as the spring admitted the taking the field for though conquest in that case would have given you a double portion of fame yet the experiment was too hazardous The ministry had you sailed would have shifted the whole blame upon you charged you with having acted without orders and condemned at once both your plan and execution  To avoid those misfortunes which might have involved you and your money accounts in perplexity and suspicion you prudently waited the arrival of a plan of operations from England which was that you should proceed to Philadelphia by the way of Chesapeak and that Burgoyne after reducing Ticonderoga should take his route by Albany and if necessary join you  The splendid laurels of last campaign have flourished in the north In that quarter America hath surprized the world and laid the foundation of her this year's glory The conquest of Ticonderoga if it may be called a conquest has like all your other victories led on to ruin Even the provisions taken in that fortress which by General Burgoyne's  return was sufficent in bread and flour for nearly men for ten weeks and in beef and pork for the same number of men for one month served only to hasten his overthrow by enabling him to proceed for Saratoga the place of his destruction A short review of the operations of the last campaign will shew the condition of affairs on both sides  You have taken Ticonderoga and marched into Philadelphia These are all the events which the year hath produced on your part A trifling campaign indeed compared with the expences of England and the conquest of the continent On the other side a considerable part of your northern force has been routed by the New York militia under General Herkemer Fort Stanwix hath bravely survived a compounded attack of soldiers and savages and the besiegers have fled The battle of Bennington has put a thousand prisoners into our hands with all their arms stores artillery and baggage General Burgoyne in two engagements has been defeated himself his army and all that were his and theirs are now ours Ticonderoga and Independence are retaken and not the shadow of an enemy remains in all the northern districts At this instant we have upwards of eleven thousand prisoners between sixty and seventy pieces of brass ordnance besides small arms tents stores c c  In order to know the real value of those advantages▪ we must reverse the scene and suppose General Gates and the force he commanded to be at your mercy as prisoners and General Burgoyne with his army of soldiers and savages to be already joined to you in Pensylvania So dismal a picture can scarcely be looked at It hath all the traces and colourings of horror and despair and excites the most swelling emotions of gratitude by exhibiting the miseries we are so graciously preserved from  I admire this distribution of laurels around the continent It is the earnest of future union South Carolina has had her day of suffering and of fame and the other southern states have exerted themselves in proportion to the force that invaded or insulted them Towards the close of the campaign in seventy six these middle states were called upon and did their duty nobly They were witnesses to the almost expiring flame of human freedom It was the close struggle of life and death The line of invisible division and on which the unabated fortitude of a Washington prevailed and saved the spark that has since blazed in the north with unrivalled lustre  Let me ask sir what great exploits have you performed Through all the variety of changes and opporunities which this war hath produced I know no one action of yours that can be stiled masterly  You have moved in and out▪ backward and forward round and round as if valour consisted in a military jig The history and figure of your movements would be truly ridiculous could they be justly delineated They resemble the labours of a puppy pursuing his tail the end is still at the same distance and all the turnings round must be done over again  The first appearance of affairs at Ticonderoga wore such an unpromising aspect that it was necessary in July to detach a part of the forces to the support of that quarter which were otherwise destined or intended to act against you and this perhaps has been the means of postponing your downfal to another campaign The destruction of one army at a time is work enough We know sir what we are about what we have to do and how to do it  Your progress from Chesapeak was marked by no capital stroke of policy or heroism Your principal aim was to get General Washington between the Delaware and Schuylkill and between Philadelphia and your army In that situation with a river on each of his flanks which united about five miles below the city and your army above him you could have intercepted his reinforcements and supplies cut off all his communication with the country and if necessary have dispatched assistance to open a passage for General Burgoyne This  scheme was too visible to succeed for had General Washington suffered you to command the open country above him I think it a very reasonable conjecture that the conquest of Burgoyne would not have taken place because you could in that case have relieved him It was therefore necessary while that important victory was in suspence to trepan  you  into a situation in which you could only be on the defensive without the power of affording him assistance The manoeuvre had its effect and Burgoyne was conquered  There has been something unmilitarily passive in you from the time of your passing the Schuylkill and getting possession of Philadelphia to the close of the campaign You mistook a trap for a conquest the probability of which had been made known to Europe and the edge of your triumph taken off by our own information long before  Having got you into this situation a scheme for a general attack upon you at Germantown was carried into execution on the fourth of October and though the success was not equal to the excellence of the plan yet the attempting it proved the genius of America to be on the rise and her power approaching to superiority The obscurity of the morning was your best friend for a fog is always favourable to an hunted enemy Some weeks after this you likewise planned an attack on General  Washington while at Whitemarsh Marched out with infinite paracle but on finding him preparing to attack you the next morning you prudently cut about and retreated to Philadelphia with all the precipitation of a man conquered in imagination  Immediately after the battle of German town the probability of Burgoyne's defeat gave a new policy to affairs in Pensylvania and it was judged most consistent with the general safety of America to wait the issue of the northern campaign Slow and sure is sound work The news of that victory arrived in our camp on the th of October and no sooner did the shout of joy and the report of the thirteen cannon reach your ears than you resolved upon a retreat and the next day that is on the th withdrew your drooping army into Philadelphia This movement was evidently dictated by fear and carried with it a positive confession that you dreaded a second attack It was hiding yourself among women and children and sleeping away the choicest part of a campaign in expensive inactivity An army in a city can never be a conquering army The situation admits only of defence It is a mere shelter and every military power in Europe will conclude you to be eventually defeated  The time when you made this retreat was the very time you ought to have fought a battle in order to put yourself in a condition of recovering in Pensylvania what you had lost at Saratoga And the reason why you did not must be either prudence or cowardice the former supposes your inability and the latter needs no explanation I draw no conclusions sir but such as are naturally deduced from known and visible facts and such as will always have a being while the facts which produced them remain unaltered  After this retreat a new difficulty arose which exhibited the power of Britain in a very contemptible light which was the attack and defence of Mud Island For several weeks did that little unfinished fortress stand out against all the attempts of Admiral and General Howe It was the fable of Bendar realized on the Delaware Scheme after scheme and force upon force were tried and defeated The garrison with scarce any thing to cover them but their bravery survived in the midst of mud shot and shells and were at last obliged to give it up more to the powers of time and gunpowder than to the military superiority of the besiegers  It is my sincere opinion that matters are in much werse condition with you than what is generally known Your master's speech at the opening of parliament is like a soliloquy on ill luck It shews him to  be coming a little to his reason for sense of pain is the first symptom of recovery in profound stupefactions His condition is deplorable He is obliged to submit to all the insults of France and Spain without daring to know or resent them and thankful for the most trivial evasions to the most humble remonstrances The time  was  when he could not  deign  an answer to a petition from America and the time now  is  when he dare not  give  an answer to an affront from France The capture of Burgoyne's army will sink his consequence as much in Europe as in America In his speech he expresses his suspicions at the warlike preparations of France and Spain and he has only the one army which you command to support his character in the world with it remains very uncertain when or in what quarter it will be most wanted or can be best employed and this will partly account for the great care you take to keep it from action and attacks for should Burgoyne's fate be yours which it probably will England may take her endless farewel not only of all America but of all the West Indies  Never did a nation invite destruction upon itself with the eagerness and ignorance with which Britain has done Bent upon the ruin of a young and unoffending country she hath drawn the sword that hath wounded herself to the heart and in the agony of her resentment hath applied a poison for a cure  Her conduct towards America is a compound of rage and lunacy she aims at the government of it yet preserves neither dignity nor character in her methods to obtain it Were government a mere manufacture or article of commerce immaterial by whom it should be made or sold we might as well employ her as another but when we consider it as the fountain from whence the general manners and morality of a country take their rise that the persons entrusted with the execution thereof are by their serious example and authority to support these principles how abominably absurd is the idea of being hereafter governed by a set of men who have been guilty of forgery perjury treachery theft and every species of villainy which the lowest wretches on earth could practise or invent What greater public curse can befal any country than to be under such authority and what greater blessing than to be delivered therefrom The soul of any man of sentiment would rise in brave rebellion against them and spurn them from the earth  The malignant and venomous tempered General Vaughan has amused his savage fancy in burning the whole town of Kingston in York government and the late governor of that state Mr Tryon in his letter to General Parsons has endeavoured to justify it and declared his with to justify it and declared his wish to burn the houses of every committeeman  in the country Such a confession from one who was once entrusted with the powers of civil government is a reproach to the character But it is the wish and the declaration of a man whom anguish and disappointment have driven to despair and who is daily decaying into the grave with constitutional rottenness  There is not in the compass of language a sufficiency of words to express the baseness of your king his ministry and his army They have refined upon villainy till it wants a name To the fiercer vices of former ages they have added the dregs and scummings of the most finished rascallity and are so completely sunk in serpentine deceit that there is not left among them  one  generous enemy  From such men and such masters may the gracious hand of Heaven preserve America And though her sufferings are heavy and severe they are like straws in the wind compared to the weight of evils she would feel under the government of your king and his pensioned parliament  There is something in meanness which excites a species of resentment that never subsides and something in cruelty which stirs up the heart to the highest agony of human hatred Britain hath filled up both these characters till no addition can be made and hath not reputation left with us to obtain credit for the slightest promise The will of  God hath parted us and the deed is registered for eternity When she shall be a spot scarcely visible among the nations America shall flourish the favourite of Heaven and the friend of mankind  For the domestic happiness of Britain and the peace of the world I wish she had not a foot of land but what is circumscribed within her own island Extent of dominion hath been her ruin and instead of civilizing others hath brutalized herself Her late reduction of India under Clive and his successors was not so properly a conquest as an extermination of mankind She is the only power who could practise the prodigal barbarity of tying men to the mouths of loaded cannon and blowing them away It happens that General Burgoyne who made the report of that horrid transaction in the House of Commons is now a prisoner with us and though an enemy I can appeal to him for the truth of it being confident that he neither can nor will deny it Yet Clive received the approbation of the last parliament  When we take a survey of mankind we cannot help cursing the wretch who to the unavoidable misfortunes of nature shall wilfully add the calamities of war One would think there were evils enough in the world without studying to increase them and that life is sufficiently short without thanking the sand that measures it The histories of  Alexander and Charles of Sweden are the histories of human devils a good man cannot think of their actions without abhorrence nor of their deaths without rejoicings To see the bounties of Heaven destroyed the beautiful face of nature laid waste and the choicest works of creation and art tumbled into ruin would fetch a curse from the soul of piety itself But in this country the aggravation is heightened by a new combination of affecting circumstances America was young and compared with other countries was virtuous None but a Herod of uncommon malice would have made war upon infancy and innocence and none but a people of the most finished fortitude dared under those circumstances have resisted tyranny The natives or their ancestors had fled from the former oppressions of England and with the industry of bees had changed a wilderness into a habitable world To Britain they were indebted for nothing The country was the gift of Heaven and God alone is their Lord and sovereign  The time sir will come when you in a melancholy hour shall reckon up your miseries by your murders in America Life with you begins to wear a clouded aspect The vision of pleasurable delusion is wearing away and changing to the barren wild of age and sorrow The poor reflection of having served your king will yield you no consolation  in your parting moments He will crumble to the same undistinguished ashes with yourself and have sins enough of his own to answer for It is not the farcical benedictions of a bishop nor the cringing hypocrisy of a court of chaplains nor the formality of an act of parliament that can change guilt into innocence or make the punishment of  one  pang the less You may perhaps be unwilling to be serious but this destruction of the goods of Providence this havock of the human race and this sowing the world with mischief must be accounted for to him who made and governs it To us they are only present sufferings but to him they are deep rebellions  If there is a sin superior to every other it is that of wilful and offensive war Most other sins are circumscribed within narrow limits that is the power of  one  man cannot give them a very general tension and many kind of sins have only a mental existence from which no infection arises but he who is the author of a war lets loose the whole contagion of hell and opens a vein that bleeds a nation to death We leave it to England and Indians to boast of these honours we feel no thirst for such savage glory a nobler flame a purer spirit animates America She hath taken up the sword of virtuous defence she hath bravely put herself between tyranny and freedom between a curse and a blessing  determined to expel the one and protect the other  It is the object only of war that makes it honourable And if ever there were  a just  war since the world began it is this which America is now engaged in She invaded no land of yours She hired no mercenaries to burn your towns nor Indians to massacre their inhabitants She wanted nothing from you and was indebted nothing to you and thus circumstanced her defence is honourable and her prosperity certain  Yet it is not on the  justice  only but likewise on the  importance  of this cause that I ground my seeming enthusiastical confidence of our success The vast extension of America makes her of too much value in the scale of Providence to be cast like a pearl before swine at the feet of an European island and of much less consequence would it be that Britain were sunk in the sea than that America should miscarry There has been such a chain of extraordinary events in the discovery of this country at first in the peopling and planting it and afterwards in the rearing and nursing it to its present state and in the protection of it through the present war that no man can doubt but Providence hath some nobler end to accomplish than the gratification of the petty Elector of Hanover or the ignorant and insignificant King of Britain  As the blood of the martyrs hath been the seed of the christian church so the political persecutions of England will and hath already enriched America with industry experience union and importance Before the present aera she was a mere chaos of uncemented colonies individually exposed to the ravages of the Indians and the invasion of any power that Britain should be at war with She had nothing she could call her own Her felicity depended upon accident The convulsions of Europe might have thrown her from one conqueror to another till she had been the slave of all and ruined by every one for until she had spirit enough to become her own master there was no knowing to which master she should belong  That  period thank God is past and she is no longer the dependant disunited colonies of Britain but the Independent and United States of America knowing no master but Heaven and herself You or your king may call this "Delusion" "Rebellion" or what name you please To us it is perfectly indifferent The issue will determine the character and time will give it a name as lasting as his own  You have now sir tried the fate of three campaigns and can fully declare to England that nothing is to be got on your part but blows and broken bones and nothing on hers but waste of  trade and credit and an encrease of poverty and taxes You are now only where you might have been two years ago without the loss of a single ship and yet not a step the forwarder towards the conquest of the continent because as I have already hinted "An army in a city can never be a conquering army" The full amount of your losses since the beginning of the war exceeds twenty thousand men besides millions of treasure for which you have nothing in exchange Our expences though great are circulated within ourselves Yours is a direct sinking of money and that from both ends at once first in hiring troops out of the nation and in paying them afterwards because the money in neither case can return again to Britain We are already in possession of the prize you only in suit for it To us it is a real treasure to you it would be only an empty triumph Our expences will repay themselves with tenfold interest while yours entail upon you everlasting poverty  Take a review sir of the ground you have gone over and let it teach you policy if it cannot honesty You stand upon a very tottering foundation A change of the ministry in England may probably bring your measures into question and your head to the block Clive with all his successes had some difficulty in escaping and yours being all a war of losses will afford you less pretensions and your enemies more ground for impeachment  Go home sir and endeavour to save the remains of your ruined country by a just representation of the madness of her measures A few moments well applied may yet preserve her from political destruction I am not one of those who wish to see Europe in a flame because I am persuaded such an event will not shorten the war The rupture at present is confined between the two powers of America and England England finds she cannot conquer America and America has no wish to conquer England You are fighting for what you can never obtain and we defending what we mean never to part with A few words therefore settle the bargain Let England mind her own business and we will mind ours Govern yourselves and we will govern ourselves You may then trade where you please unmolested by us and we will trade where we please unmolested by you and such articles as we can purchase of each other better than elsewhere may be mutually done If it were possible that you could carry on the war for twenty years you must still come to this point at last or worse and the sooner you think of it the better it will be for you  My official situation enables me to know the repeated insults which Britain is obliged to put up with from foreign powers and the wretched shifts she is driven to to gloss them over Her reduced  strength and exhausted coffers in a three years war with America have given a powerful superiority to France and Spain She is now a match for them But if neither counsels can prevail on her to think nor sufferings awaken her to reason she must e'en go on till the honour of England becomes a proverb of contempt and Europe dub her the land of fools  I am Sir With every Wish for an honourable Peace  Your Friend Enemy and Countryman  COMMON SENSE  To the Inhabitants of America  WITH all the pleasure with which a man exchanges bad company for good I take my leave of Sir William and return to you It is now nearly three years since the tyranny of Britain received its first repulse by the arms of America A period which has given birth to the New World and erected a monument of folly to the old  I cannot help being sometimes surprised at the complimentary references which I have seen and heard made to ancient histories and transactions The wisdom of civil governments and sense of honour of the States of Greece and Rome are frequently held up as objects of excellence and imitation Mankind have lived for very little purpose if at this period of the world they must go two or three thousand years back for lessons and examples We do dishonourary injustice to ourselves by placing them in such a superior line We have no just authority for it neither can we tell why it is that we should suppose ourselves inferior  Could the mist of antiquity be taken away and men and things viewed as they then really were it is more than probable that they would admire us rather than we them America has surmounted a  greater variety and combination of difficulties than I believe ever fell to the share of any one people in the same space of time and has replenished the world with more useful knowledge and sounder maxims of civil government than were ever produced in any age before Had it not been for America there had been no such thing as freedom left throughout the whole universe England hath lost hers in a long chain of right reasoning from wrong principles and it is from this now she must learn the resolution to redress herself and the wisdom how  The Grecians and Romans were strongly possessed of the  spirit  of liberty but  not  the  principle  for at the time they were determined not to be slaves themselves they employed their power to enslave the rest of mankind But this distinguished aera is blotted by no one misanthropical vice In short if the principle on which the cause is founded the universal blessings that are to arise from it the difficulties that accompanied it the wisdom with which it has been debated the sortitude by which it has been supported the strength of the power we had to oppose and the condition in which we undertook it be all taken in one view we may justly stile it the most virtuous and illustrious revolution that ever graced the history of mankind  A good opinion of ourselves is exceedingly necessary in private life but absolutely necessary in  public life and of the utmost importance in supporting national character I have no notion of yielding the palm of the United States to any Grecians or Romans that were ever born We have equalled the bravest in times of danger and excelled the wisest in the construction of civil governments  no one in America excepted  From this agreeable eminence let us take a review of present affairs The spirit of corruption is so inseparably interwoven with British politics that their ministry suppose all mankind are governed by the same motive They have no idea of people submitting even to a temporary inconvenience from an attachment to rights and privileges Their plans of business are calculated  by  the hour and  for  the hour and are uniform in nothing but in the corruption which give them birth They never had neither have they at this time any regular plan for the conquest of America by arms They know not how to go about it neither have they the power to effect it if they could know The thing is not within the compass of human practicability for America is too extensive either to be fully conquered or  passively  defended But she may be  actively  defended by defeating or making prisoners of the army that invades her And this is the only system of defence that can be effectual in a large country  There is something in a war carried on by invasion which makes it differ in circumstances from any other mode of war because he who conducts it cannot tell whether the ground he gains be for him or against him when he first makes it In the winter of seventy six General Howe marched with an air of victory through the Jerseys the consequence of which was his defeat and General Burgoyne at Saratoga experienced the same fate from the same cause The Spaniards about two years ago were defeated by the Algerines in the same manner that is their first triumphs became a trap in which they were totally routed And whoever will attend to the circumstances and events of a war carried on by invasion will find that any invader in order to be finally conquered must begin first to conquer  I confefs myself one of those who believe the loss of Philadelphia to be attended with more advantages than injuries The case stood thus The enemy imagined Philadelphia to be of more importance to us than it really was for we all know that it had long ceased to be a port not a cargo of goods had been brought into it for near a twelvemonth nor any fixed manufactories nor even shipbuilding carried on in it yet as the enemy believed the conquest of it to be practicable and to that belief added the absurd idea that the soul of all America was centered there and would be conquered there it naturally follows  that their possession of it by not answering the end proposed must break up the plans they had foolishly gone upon and either oblige them to form a new one for which their present strength is not sufficient or to give over the attempt  We never had so small an army to fight against nor so fair an opportunity of final success as  now  The death wound is already given The day is our own if we follow it up The enemy by his situation is within our reach and by his reduced strength is within our power The ministers of Britain may rage as they please but our part is to conquer their armies Let them wrangle and welcome but let it not draw our attention from the  one  thing needful  Here    in this  spot is our business to be accomplished our felicity secured What we have now to do is as clear as light and the way to do it is as strait as a line It needs not to be commented upon yet in order to be perfectly understood I will put a case that cannot admit of a mistake  Had the armies under Generals Howe and Burgoyne been united and taken post at Germantown and had the northern army under General Gates been joined to that under General Washington at Whitemarsh the consequence would have been a general action and if in that action we had killed and taken the same number of officers and men that is between nine and ten thousand with the  same quantity of artillery arms stores c as have been taken at the northward and obliged General Howe with the remains of his army that is with the same number he now commands to take shelter in Philadelphia we should certainly have thought ourselves the greatest heroes in the world and should as soon as the season permitted have collected together all the force of the continent and laid siege to the city for it requires a much greater force to besiege an enemy in a town than to defeat them in the field The case  now  is just the same as if it had been produced by the means I have here supposed Between nine and ten thousand have been killed and taken all their stores are in our possession and General Howe in consequence of that victory has thrown himself for shelter into Philadelphia He or his trifling friend Galloway may form what pretences they please yet no just reason can be given for their going into winter quarters so early as the th of October but their apprehension of a defeat if they continued out or their conscious inability to keep the field with safety I see no advantage which can arise to America by hunting the enemy from State to State It is a triumph without a prize and wholly unworthy the attention of a people determined to conquer Neither can any State promise to itself security while the enemy remains in a condition to transport themselves from one part of the continent  to another Howe likewise cannot conquer where we have no army to oppose therefore any such removals in him are mean and cowardly and reduces Britain to a common pilferer If he retreats from Philadelphia he will be despised if he stays he may be shut up and starved out and the country if he advances into may become his Saratoga He has his choice of evils and we of opportunities If he moves early it is not only a sign but a proof that he expects no reinforcement and his delays will prove that he either waits for the arrival of a plan to go upon or force to execute it or both in  which  case our strength will encrease more than his therefore in  any  case we cannot be wrong if we do but proceed  The particular condition of Pensylvania deserves the attention of all the other States Her military strength must not be estimated by the number of inhabitants Here are men of all nations characters professions and interests Here are the firmest whigs surviving like sparks in the ocean unquenched and uncooled in the midst of discouragement and disaffection Here are men losing their all with cheerfulness and collecting fire and fortitude from the flames of their own estates Here are others skulking in secret many making a market of the times and numbers who are changing whig and tory with the circumstances of every day  It is by mere dint of fortitude and perseverance that the whigs of this state have been able to maintain so good a countenance and do even what they have done We want help and the sooner it can arrive the more effectual it will be The invaded state be it which it may will always feel an additional burthen upon its back and be hard set to support its civil power with sufficient authority and this difficulty will always rise or fall in proportion as the other states throw in their assistance to the common cause  The enemy will most probably make many manoeuvres at the opening of this campaign to amuse and draw off the attention of the several states from the  one thing needful  We may expect to hear of alarms and pretended expeditions to  this  place and  that  place to the southward the eastward and the northward all intended to prevent our forming into one formidable body The less the enemy's strength is the more subtleties of this kind will they make use of Their existence depends upon it because the force of America when collected is sufficient to swallow their present army up It is therefore our business to make short work of it by bending our whole attention to  this one principal point  for the instant that the main body under General Howe is defeated all the inferior alarms throughout the continent like so many shadows will follow his downfal  The only way to finish a war with the least possible bloodshed or perhaps without any is to collect an army against the power of which the enemy shall have no chance By not doing this we prolong the war and double both the calamities and the expences of it What a rich and happy country would America be were she by a vigourous exertion to reduce Howe as she hath reduced Burgoyne Her currency would rise to millions beyond its present value Every man would be rich and every man would have it in his power to be happy And why not do these things What is there to hinder America is her own mistress and can do what she pleases  If we had not at this time a man in the field we could nevertheless raise an army in a few weeks sufficient to overwhelm all the force which General Howe at present commands Vigour and determination will do any thing and every thing We began the war with this kind of spirit why not end it with the same Here gentlemen is the enemy Here is the army The interest the happiness of all America is centered in this half ruined spot Come on and help us Here are laurels come and share them Here are tories come and help us to expel them Here are whigs that will make you welcome and enemies that dread your coming  The worst of all policy is that of doing things by halves Penny wise and pound foolish has been  the ruin of thousands The present spring if rightly improved will free us from all our troubles and save us the expence of millions We have now only one army to cope with No opportunity can be fairer no prospect more promising I shall conclude this paper with a few outlines of a plan either for filling up the battalions with expedition or for raising an additional force for any limited time on any sudden emergency  That in which every man is interested is every man's duty to support And any burthen which falls equally on all men and from which every man is to receive an equal benefit is consistent with the most perfect ideas of liberty I would wish to revive something of that virtuous ambition which first called America into the field Then every man was eager to do his part and perhaps the principal reason why we have in any degree fallen therefrom is because we did not set a sufficient value by it at first but left it to blaze out by itself instead of regulating and preserving it by just proportions of rest and service  Suppose any state whose number of effective inhabitants was should be required to furnish men towards the defence of the continent on any sudden emergency  First Let the whole number of effective inhabitants be divided into hundreds then if each of those  hundreds turn out four men the whole number of will be had  Secondly Let the names of each hundred men be entered in a book and let four dollars be collected from each man with as much more as any of the gentlemen whose abilities can afford it shall please to throw in which gifts shall likewise be entered against the donors names  Thirdly Let the sums so collected be offered as a present over and above the bounty of twenty dollars to any four who may be inclined to propose themselves as volunteers if more than four offer the majority of the subscribers present shall determine which if none offer then four out of the hundred shall be taken by lot who shall be entitled to the said sums and shall either go or provide others that will in the space of six days  Fourthly As it will always happen that in the space of ground on which an hundred men shall live there will be always a number of persons who by age and infirmity are incapable of doing personal service and as such persons are generally possessed of the greatest part of the property in any county their portion of service therefore will be to furnish each man with a blanket which will make a regimental coat jacket and breeches or cloaths in lieu thereof and another for a watch cloak and two pair of shoesfor however choice people may be of these things matters not in cases of this  kindThose who live always in houses can find many ways to keep themselves warm but it is a shame and a sin to suffer a soldier in the field to want a blanket while there is one in the country  Should the cloathing not be wanted the superannuated or infirm persons possessing property may in lieu thereof throw in their money subscriptions towards encreasing the bounty for though age will naturally exempt a personal service it cannot exempt him from his share of the charge because the men are raised for the defence of property and liberty jointly  There never was a scheme against which objections might not be raised But this alone is not a sufficient reason for rejection The only line to judge truly upon is to draw out and admit all the objections which can fairly be made and place against them all the contrary qualities conveniences and advantages then by striking a balance you come at the true character of any scheme principle or position  The most material advantages of the plan here proposed are ease expedition and cheapness yet the men so raised get a much larger bounty than is any where at present given because all the expences extravagance and consequent idleness of recruiting are saved or prevented The country incurs no new debt nor interest thereon the whole matter being all settled at once and entirely done  with It is a subscription answering all the purposes of a tax without either the charge or trouble of collecting The men are ready for the field with the greatest possible expedition because it becomes the duty of the inhabitants themselves in every part of the country to find up their proportion of men instead of leaving it to a recruiting serjeant who be he ever so industrious cannot know always where to apply  I do not propose this as a regular digested plan neither will the limits of this paper admit any further remarks upon it I believe it to be a hint capable of much improvement and as such submit it to the public  Philadelphia  THE CRISIS  No VII  To the Earl of Carlisle General Clinton and William Eden Esq British Commissioners at New York  THERE is a dignity in the warm passions of a whig which is never to be found in the cold malice of a tory In the one nature is only heated in the other she is poisoned The instant the former has it in his power to punish he feels a disposition to forgive but the canine venom of the latter knows no relief but revenge This general distinction will I believe apply in all cases and suit as well the meridian of England as America  As I presume your last proclamation will undergo the strictures of other pens I shall confine my remarks to only a few parts thereof All that you have said might have been comprised in half the compass It is tedious and unmeaning and only a repetition of your former follies with here and there an offensive aggravation Your cargo of pardons will have no marketIt is unfashionable  to look at them Even speculation is at an end They are become a perfect drug and no way calculated for the climate  In the course of your proclamation you say "The policy as well as the BENEVOLENCE OF GREAT BRITAIN have thus far checked the extremes of war when they tended to distress a people still considered as their fellow subjects and to desolate a country shortly to become again a source of mutual advantage" What you mean by "the BENEVOLENCE of Great Britain" is to me inconceivable To put a plain question Do you consider yourselves men or devils For until this point is settled no determinate sense can be put upon the expression You have already equalled and in many places excelled the savages of either Indies and if you have yet a cruelty in store you must have imported it unmixed with every human material from the original warehouse of hell  To the interposition of Providence and her blessings on our endeavours and not to BRITISH BENEVOLENCE are we indebted for the short chain that limits your ravages Remember you do not at this time command a foot of land on the continent of America Staten Island York Island a small part of Long Island and Rhode Island circumscribe your power and even those you hold at the expence of the West Indies To avoid a  defeat and prevent a desertion of your troops you have taken up your quarters in holes and corners of inaccessible security and in order to conceal what every one can conceive you now endeavour to impose your weakness upon us for an act of mercy If you think to succeed by such shadowy devices you are but infants in the political world you have the A B C of stratagem yet to learn and are wholly ignorant of the people you have to contend with Like men in a state of intoxication you forget that the rest of the world have eyes and that the same stupidity which conceals you from yourselves exposes you to their satire and contempt  The paragraph I have quoted stands as an introduction to the following "But when that country America professes the unnatural design not only of estranging herself from us but of mortgaging herself and her resources to our enemies the whole contest is changed and the question is how far Great Britain may by every means in her power destroy or render useless a connection contrived for her ruin and the aggrandizement of France Under such circumstances the laws of selfpreservation must direct the conduct of Britain and if the British Colonies are to become an accession to France will direct her to render that accession of as little avail as possible to her enemy  I consider you in this declaration like madmen biting in the hour of death It contains likewise a fraudulent meanness for in order to justify a barbarous conclusion you have advanced a false position The treaty we have formed with France is open noble and generous It is the true policy founded on sound philosophy and neither a surrender or mortgage as you would scandalously insinuate I have seen every article and speak from positive knowledge In France we have found an affectionate friend a faithful ally from Britain nothing but tyranny cruelty and infidelity  But the happiness is that the mischief you threaten is not in your power to execute and if it were the punishment would return upon you in a tenfold degree The humanity of America hath hitherto restrained her from acts of retaliation and the affection she retains for many individuals in England who have fed clothed and comforted her prisoners has to the present day warded off her resentment and operated as a screen to the whole But even these considerations must cease when national objects interfere and oppose them Repeated aggravations will provoke a retort and policy justify the measure We mean now to take you seriously up upon your own ground and principles and as you do so shall you be done by  You ought to know gentlemen that England and Scotland are far more exposed to incendiary  desolation than America in her present state can possibly be We occupy a country with but few towns and whose riches consist in land and annual produce The two last can susser but little and that only within a very limited compass In Britain it is otherwise Her wealth lies chiefly in cities and large towns the repositories of manufactures and fleets of merchantmenThere is not a nobleman's country seat but may be laid in ashes by a single person Your own may probably contribute to the proof In short there is no evil which cannot be returned when you come to incendiary mischiefThe ships in the Thames may certainly be easily set on fire as the temporary bridge was a few years ago yet of that affair no discovery was ever made and the loss you would sustain by such an event executed at a proper season is infinitely greater than any you can inflict The East India house and the bank neither are nor can be secure from this sort of destruction and as Dr Price justly observes a fire at the latter would bankrupt the nation It has never been the custom of France and England when at war to make those havocs on each other because the ease with which they could retaliate rendered it as impolitic as if each had destroyed his own  But think not gentlemen that our distance secures you or our invention fails us We can much easier accomplish such a point than any nation in Europe  We talk the same language dress in the same habit and appear with the same manners as yourselves We can pass from one part of England to another unsuspected many of us are as well acquainted with the country as you are and should you impoliticly provoke our will you will most assuredly lament the effects of it Mischiefs of this kind requires no army to execute them The means are obvious and the opportunities unguardable I hold up a warning piece to your senses if you have any left and "to the unhappy people likewise whose affairs are committed to you  General Clinton's letter to Congress  " I call not with the rancour of an enemy but with the earnestness of a friend on the deluded people of England lest between your blunders and theirs they sink beneath the evils contrived for us  "He who lives in a glasshouse says the Spanish proverb should never begin throwing stones" This gentlemen is exactly your case and you must be the most ignorant of mankind or suppose us so not to see on which side the balance of accounts will fall There are many other modes of retaliation which for several reasons I choose not to mention But be assured of this that the instant you put a threat in execution a counter blow will follow it If you openly profess yourselves savages it is high time we should treat you as such  and if nothing but distress can recover you to reason to punish will become an office of charity  While your fleet lay last winter in the Delaware I offered my service to the Pensylvanian navyboard then at Trenton as one who would make a party with them or any four or five gentlemen on an expedition down the river to set fire to it and though it was not then accepted nor the thing personally attempted it is more than probable that your own folly will provoke a much more vulnerable part Say not when the mischief is done that you had warning and remember that we did not begin it but mean to repay it Thus much for your savage and impolitic threat  In another part of your proclamation you say "But if the honours of a military life are become the object of the Americans let them seek those honours under the banners of their rightful sovereign and in fighting the battles of the united British empire against our late mutual and natural enemies" Surely The union of absurdity with madness was never marked with more distinguishable lines than these Your rightful sovereign as you call him may do well enough for you who dare not enquire into the humble capacities of the man but we who estimate persons and things by their real worth cannot suffer our judgments to be so imposed upon and unless it is your wish to see him exposed it ought to be your endeavour to  keep him out of sight The less you have to say about him the better We have done with him and that ought to be answer enough You have often been told so Strange that the answer must be so often repeated You go a begging with your king as with a brat or with some unsaleable commodity you were tired of and though every body tells no no still you keep hawking him about But there is one who will have him in a little time and as we have no inclination to disappoint you of a customer we bid you nothing for him  The impertinent folly of the paragraph I have just quoted deserve no other notice than to be laughed at and thrown by but the principle on which it is founded is detestable We are invited to submit to a man who has attempted by every cruelty to destroy us and to join him in making war against France who is already at war against him for our support  Can Bedlam in concert with Lucifer form a more mad and devilish request Were it possible a people could sink into such apostacy they would deserve to be swept from the earth like the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah The proposition is an universal affront to the rank which man holds in the creation and an indignity to him who placed him there It supposes him made up without a spark of honour and under no obligation to God or man  What sort of men or Christians must you suppose the Americans to be who after seeing their most humble petitions insultingly rejected the most grievous laws passed to distress them in every quarter an undeclared war let loose upon them and Indians and negroes invited to the slaughter who after seeing their kindred murdered their fellow citizens starved to death in prisons and their houses and property destroyed and buried who after the most serious appeals to heaven the most solemn abjuration by oath of all government connected with you and the most heartfelt pledges and protestations of faith to each other and who after soliciting the friendship and entering into alliances with other nations should at last break through all these obligations civil and divine by complying with your horrid and infernal proposal Ought we ever after to be considered as a part of the human race Or ought we not rather to be blotted from the society of mankind and become a spectacle of misery to the world But there is something in corruption which like a jaundiced eye transfers the colour of of itself to the object it looks upon and sees every thing stained and impure for unless you were capable of such conduct yourselves you could never have supposed such a character in us The offer fixes your infamy It exhibits you as a nation without faith with whom oaths and treaties are considered as trifles and the breaking them as the  breaking of a bubble Regard to decency or to rank might have taught you better or pride inspired you though virtue could not There is not left a step in the degradation of character to which you can now descend you have put your foot on the ground floor and the key of the dungeon is turned upon you  That the invitation may want nothing of being a complete monster you have thought proper to finish it with an assertion which has no foundation either in fact or philosophy and as Mr Ferguson your secretary is a man of letters and has made civil society his study and published a treatise on that subject I address this part to him  In the close of the paragraph which I last quoted France is stiled the "natural enemy" of England and by way of lugging us into some strange idea she is stiled the "late mutual and natural enemy" of both countries I deny that she ever was the natural enemy of either and that there does not exist in nature such a principle The expression is an unmeaning barbarism and wholly unphilosophical when applied to beings of the same species let their station in the creation be what it may We have a perfect idea of a natural enemy when we think of the devil because the enmity is perpetual unalterable and unabateable It admits neither of peace truce or treaty consequently the warfare is eternal and therefore it is natural But man with man  cannot arrange in the same opposition Their quarrels are accidental and equivocally created They become friends or enemies at the change of temper as the cast of interest inclines them The Creator of man did not constitute them the natural enemy of each other He has not made any one order of beings so Even wolves may quarrel still they herd together If any two nations are so then must all nations be so otherwise it is not nature but custom and the offence frequently originates with the accuser England is as truly the natural enemy of France as France is of England and perhaps more so Separated from the rest of Europe she has contracted an unsocial habit of manners and imagines in others the jealousy she creates in herself Never long satisfied with peace she supposes the discontent universal and buoyed up with her own importance conceives herself the only object pointed at The expression has been often used and always with a fraudulent design for when the idea of a natural enemy is conceived it prevents all other enquiries and the real cause of the quarrel is hidden in the universality of the conceit Men start at the notion of a natural enemy and ask no other question The cry obtains credi like the alarm of a mad dog and is one of those kind of tricks which by operating on the common passions secures their interest through their folly  But we sir are not to be thus imposed upon We live in a large world and have extended our ideas beyond the limits and prejudices of an island We hold out the right hand of friendship to all the universe and we conceive there to be a sociality in the manners of France which is much better disposed to peace and negociation than that of England and until the latter becomes more civilized she cannot expect to live long at peace with any power Her common language is vulgar and offensive and children with their milk suck in the rudiments of insult"The arm of Britain The mighty arm of Britain Britain that shakes the earth to its center and its poles The scourge of France The terror of the world That governs with a nod and pours down vengeance like a God" This language neither makes a nation great or little but it shews a savageness of manners and has a tendency to keep national animosity alive The entertainments of the stage are calculated to the same end and almost every public exhibition is tinctured with insult Yet England is always in dread of France Terrified at the apprehension of an invasion Suspicious of being outwitted in a treaty and privately cringing though she is publicly offending Let her therefore reform her manners and do justice and she will find the idea of a natural enemy to be only a phantom of her own imagination  Little did I think at this period of the war to see a proclamation which could promise you no one useful purpose whatever and tend only to expose you One would think you were just awakened from a four years dream and knew nothing of what had passed in the interval Is this a time to be offering pardons or renewing the long forgotten subjects of charters and taxation Is it worth your while after every force has failed you to retreat under the shelter of argument and persuasion Or can you think that we with nearly half your army prisoners and in alliance with France are to be begged or threatened into a submission by a piece of paper But as commissioners at a hundred pounds sterling a week each you conceive yourselves bound to do something and the genius of illfortune told you you must write  For my own part I have not put pen to paper these several months Convinced of your superiority by the issue of every campaign I was inclined to hope that that which all the rest of the world now see would become visible to you and therefore felt unwilling to ruffle your temper by fretting you with repetitions and discoveries There have been intervals of hesitation in your conduct from which it seemed a pity to disturb you and a charity to leave you to yourselves You have often stopt as if you intended to think but your thoughts have ever been too early or too late  There was a time when Britain disdained to answer and even to hear a petition from America That time is past and she in her turn is petitioning our acceptance We now stand on higher ground and offer her peace and the time will come when she perhaps in vain will ask it from us The latter case is as probable as the former ever was She cannot refuse to acknowledge our independence with greater obstinacy than she before refused to repeal her laws and if America alone could bring her to the one united with France she will reduce her to the other There is something in obstinacy which differs from every other passion whenever it fails it never recovers but either breaks like iron or crumbles sulkily away like a fractured arch Most other passions have their periods of fatigue and rest their sufferings and their cure but obstinacy has no resource and the first wound is mortal You have already begun to give it up and you will from the natural construction of the vice find yourselves both obliged and inclined to do so  If you look back you see nothing but loss and disgrace If you look forward the same scene continues and the close is an impenetrable gloom You may plan and execute little mischiefs but are they worth the expence they cost you or will such partial evils have any effect  on the general cause Your expedition to EggHarbour will be felt at a distance like an attack upon a henroost and expose you in Europe with a sort of childish phrensy It is well worth while to keep an army to protect you in writing proclamations or to get once a year into winter quarters Possessing yourselves of towns is not conquest but convenience and in which you will one day or the other be trepanned Your retreat from Philadelphia was only a timely escape and your next expedition may be less fortunate  It would puzzle all the politicians in the universe to conceive what you stay for or why you should have staid so long You are prosecuting a war in which you confess you have neither object nor hope and that conquest could it be effected would not repay the charges In the mean while the rest of your affairs are running into ruin and a European war kindled against you In such a situation there is neither doubt or difficulty the first rudiments of reason will determine the choice for if peace can be procured with more advantages than even a conquest can be obtained he must be an ideot indeed that hesitates  But you are probably buoyed up by a set of wretched mortals who having deceived themselves are cringing with the duplicity of a spaniel  for a little temporary bread Those men will tell you just what you please It is their interest to amuse in order to lengthen out their protection They study to keep you amongst them for that very purpose and in proportion as you disregard their advice and grow callous to their complaints they will stretch into improbability and pepper off their flattery the higher Characters like these are to be found in every country and every country will despise them  Philadelphia  Oct  THE CRISIS  No VIII  To the People of England  THERE are stages in the business of serious life in which to amuse is cruel but to deceive is to destroy and it is of little consequence in the conclusion whether men deceive themselves or submit by a kind of mutual consent to the impositions of each other That England has been long under the influence of delusion or mistake needs no other proof than the unexpected and wretched situation she is now involved in And so powerful has been the influence that no provision was ever made or thought of against the misfortune because the possibility of its happening was never conceived  The general and successful resistance of America the conquest of Burgoyne and a war with France were treated in parliament as the dreams of a discontented opposition or a distempered imagination They were beheld as objects unworthy of a serious thought and the bare intimation of  them afforded the ministry a triumph of laughter Short triumph indeed For every thing which has been predicted has happened and all that was promised have failed A long series of politics so remarkably distinguished by a succession of misfortunes without one alleviating turn must certainly have something in it systematically wrong It is sufficient to awaken the most credulous into suspicion and most obstinate into thought Either the means in your power are insufficient or the measures illplanned either the execution has been bad or the thing attempted impracticable or to speak more emphatically either you are not able or Heaven is not willing For why is it that you have not conquered us Who or what has prevented you You have had every opportunity you could desire and succceded to your utmost wish in every preparatory means Your fleets and armies have arrived in America without an accident No uncommon misfortune hath intervened No foreign nation hath interfered until the time you had allotted for victory was past The opposition either in or out of parliament neither disconcerted your measures retarded or diminished your force They only foretold your sate Every ministerial scheme was carried with as high a hand as if the whole nation had been unanimous Every thing wanted was asked for and every thing asked  for was granted A greater force was not within the compass of your abilities to send and the time you sent it was of all others the most favourable You were then at rest with the whole world beside You had the range of every court in Europe uncontradicted by us You amused us with a tale of commissioners of peace and under that disguise collected a numerous army and came almost unexpectedly upon us The force was much greater than we looked for and that which we had to oppose it with was unequal in numbers badly armed and poorly disciplined besides which it was embodied only for a short time and expired within a few months after your arrival We had governments to form measures to concert an army to raise and train and every necessary article to import or to create Our nonimportation scheme had exhausted our stores and your command by sea intercepted our supplies We were a people unknown and unconnected with the political world and strangers to the disposition of foreign powers Could you possibly wish for a more favorable conjunction of circumstances Yet all these have happened and passed away and as it were left you with a laugh They are likewise events of such an original nativity as can never happen again unless a new world should arise from the ocean  If any thing can be a lesson to presumption surely the circumstances of this war will have their  effect Had Britain been defeated by any European power her pride would have drawn consolation from the importance of her conquerors but in the present case she is excelled by those she affected to despise and her own opinion retorting on herself become an aggravation of her disgrace Misfortune and experience are lost upon mankind when they produce neither reflection nor reformation Evils like poisons have their uses and there are diseases which no other remedy can reach It has been the crime and folly of England to suppose herself invincible and that without acknowledging or perceiving that a full third of her strength was drawn from the country she is now at war with The arm of Britain has been spoken of as the arm of the Almighty and she has lived of late as if she thought the whole world created for her diversion Her politics instead of civilizing has tended to brutalize mankind and under the vain unmeaning title of "Defender of the Faith" she has made war like an Indian against the religion of humanity Her cruelties in the East Indies will NEVER NEVER be forgotten and it is somewhat remarkable that the produce of that ruined country transported to America should there kindle up a war to punish the destroyer The chain is continued though with a kind of mysterious uniformity both in the crime and the punishment The latter  runs parallel with the former and time and fate will give it a perfect illustration  Where information is withheld ignorance becomes a reasonable excuse and one would charitably hope that the people of England do not encourage cruelty from choice but from mistake Their recluse situation surrounded by the sea preserves them from the calamities of war and keeps them in the dark as to the conduct of their own armies They see not therefore they feel not They tell the tale that is told them and believe it and accustomed to no other news than their own they receive it stript of its horrors and prepared for the palate of the nation through the channel of the London Gazette They are made to believe that their generals and armies differ from those of other nations and have nothing of rudeness or barbarity in them They suppose them what they wish them to be They feel a disgrace in thinking otherwise and naturally encourage the belief from a partiality to themselves There was a time when I felt the same prejudices and reasoned from the same errors but experience sad and painful experience has taught me better What the conduct of former armies was I know not but what the conduct of the present is I well know It is low cruel indolent and prossigate and had the people of America no other cause for separation than what  the army has occasioned that alone is cause enough  The field of politics in England is far more extensive than that of news Men have a right to reason for themselves and though they cannot contradict the intelligence in the London Gazette they can frame upon it what sentiments they please But the misfortune is that a general ignorance has prevailed over the whole nation respecting America The ministry and the minority have both been wrong The former was always so the latter only lately so Politics to be executively right must have a unity of means and time and a defect in either overthrows the whole The ministry rejected the plans of the minority while they were practicable and joined in them when they became impracticable From wrong measures they got into wrong time and have now completed the circle of absurdity by closing it upon themselves  It was my fate to come to America a few months before the breaking out of hostilities I found the disposition of the people such that they might have been led by a thread and governed by a reed Their suspicion was quick and penetrating but their attachment to Britain was obstinate and it was at that time a kind of treason to speak against it They disliked the ministry but they esteemed the nation Their idea of grievance operated without resentment and their single object was reconciliation  Bad as I believed the ministry to be I never conceived them capable of a measure so rash and wicked as the commencing of hostilities much less did I imagine the nation would encourage it I viewed the dispute as a kind of lawsuit in which I supposed the parties would find a way either to decide or settle it I had no thoughts of independence or of arms The world could not then have persuaded me that I should be either a soldier or an author If I had any talents for either they were buried in me and might ever have continued so had not the necessity of the times dragged and driven them into action I had formed my plan of life and conceiving myself happy wished every body else so But when the country into which I had just put my foot was set on fire about my ears it was time to stir It was time for every man to stir Those who had been long settled and had something to defend those who had just come had something to pursue and the call and the concern was equal and universal For in a country where all men were once adventurers the difference of a few years in their arrival could make none in their right  The breaking out of hostilities opened a new suspicion in the politics of America which though at that time very rare has been since proved to be very right What I allude to is "A secret and fixt determination in the British cabinet to annex  America to the crown of England as a conquered country" If this be taken as the object then the whole line of conduct pursued by the ministry though rash in its origin and ruinous in its consequences is nevertheless uniform and consistent in its parts It applies to every case and resolves every difficulty But if taxation or any thing else taken in its room then there is no proportion between the object and the charge Nothing but the whole soil and property of the country can be placed as a possible equivalent against the millions which the ministry expended No taxes raised in America could possibly repay it A revenue of two millions sterling a year would not discharge the sum and interest accumulated thereon in twenty years  Reconciliation never appears to have been the wish or the object of administration they looked on conquest as certain and infallible and under that persuasion sought to drive the Americans into what they might stile a general rebellion and then crushing them with arms in their hands reap the rich harvest of a general confiscation and silence them for ever The dependants at court were too numerous to be provided for in England The market for plunder in the East Indies were over and the profligacy of government required that a a new mine should be opened and that mine could be no other than America conquered and  forfeited They had no where else to go Every other channel was drained and extravagance with the thirst of a drunkard was gaping for supplies  If the ministry deny this to have been their plan it becomes them to explain what was their plan For either they have abused us in coveting property they never laboured for or they have abused you in expending an amazing sum upon an incompetent object Taxation as I mentioned before could never be worth the charge of obtaining it by arms and any kind of formal obedience which America could have made would have weighed with the lightness of a laugh against such a load of expence It is therefore most probable that the ministry will at last justify their policy by their dishonesty and openly declare that their original design was conquest And in this case it well becomes the people of England to consider how far the nation would have been benefited by the success  In a general view there are few conquests that repay the charge of making them and mankind are pretty well convinced that it can never be worth their while to go to war for profit sake If they are made war upon their country invaded or their existence at stake it is their duty to defend and preserve themselves but in every other light and from every other cause is war inglorious and detestable But to return to the case in question  When conquests are made of foreign countries it is supposed that the COMMERCE and DOMINION  of the country which made them are extended But this could neither be the object nor the consequence of the present war You enjoyed the whole commerce before It could receive no possible addition by a conquest but on the contrary must diminish as the inhabitants were reduced in numbers and wealth You had the DOMINION over the country which you used to have and had no complaint to make against her for breach of any part of the compact between you and her or contending against any established custom commercial political or territorial The country and commerce were both your own when you BEGAN to conquer in the same manner and form as they had been your own an hundred years before Nations have sometimes been induced to make conquests for the sake only of reducing the power of their enemies or bringing it to a balance with their own But this could be no part of your plan No foreign authority was claimed here neither was any such authority suspected by you or acknowledged or imagined by us What then in the name of heaven could you go to war for or what chance could you possibly have in the event but either to hold the same country which you held before and that in a much worse condition or to lose with an amazing expence what you might have retained without a farthing charges  War never can be the interest of a trading nation any more than quarrelling can be profitable to a man in business But to make war with those who trade with us is like setting a bulldog upon a customer at the shop door The least degree of common sense shews the madness of the latter and it will apply with the same force of conviction to the former Piratical nations having neither commerce or commodities of their own to lose may make war upon all the world and lucratively find their account in it But it is quite otherwise with Britain For besides the stoppage of trade in time of war she exposes more of her own property to be lost than she has the chance of taking from others Some ministerial gentlemen in parliament have mentioned the greatness of her trade as an apology for the greatness of her loss This is miserable politics indeed because it ought to have been given as a reason for her not engaging in a war at first The coast of America commands the West India trade almost as effectually as the coast of Africa does that of the Streights and England can no more carry to the former without the consent of America than she can the latter without a Mediterranean pass  In whatever light the war with America is considered upon commercial principles it is evidently the interest of the people of England not to support it and why it has been supported so long  against the clearest demonstrations of truth and national advantage is to me and must be to all the reasonable world a matter of actonishment Perhaps it may be said that I live in America and write this from interest To this I reply that my principles are universal My attachment is to all the world and not to any particular part and if what I advance is right no matter where or who it comes from We have given the proclamation of your commissioners a currency in our newspapers and I have no doubt but you will give this a place in yours To oblige and be obliged is fair  Before I dismiss this part of my address I shall mention one more circumstance in which I think the people of England have been equally mistaken and then proceed to other matter  There is such an idea existing in the world as that of NATIONAL HONOUR and this falsely understood is oftentimes the cause of war In a christian and philosophical sense mankind seem to have stood still at individual civilization and to retain as nations all the original rudeness of nature Peace by treaty is only a cessation of violence for a reformation of sentiment It is a substitute for a principle that is wanting and ever will be wanting till the idea of NATIONAL HONOUR be rightly understood As individuals we profess ourselves christians but as nations we are heathens Romans and what not I remember the  late Admiral Saunders declaring in the House of Commons and that in the time of peace "That the city of Madrid laid in ashes was not a sufficient atonement for the Spaniards taking off the rudder of an English sloop of war" I do not ask whether this is christianity or morality I ask whether it is decency whether it is proper language for a nation to use In private life we should call it by the plain name of bullying and the elevation of rank cannot alter its character It is I think exceedingly easy to define what ought to be understood by national honour for that which is the best character for an individual is the best character for a nation and wherever the latter exceeds or falls beneath the former there is a departure from the line of true greatness  I have thrown out this observation with a design of applying it to Great Britain Her idea of national honour seems devoid of that benevolence of heart that universal expansion of philanthropy and that triumph over the rage of vulgar prejudice without which man is inferior to himself and a companion of common animals To know whom she shall regard or dislike she asks what country they are of what religion they profefs and what property they enjoy Her idea of national honour seems to consist in national insult and that to be a great people is to be neither a christian a philosopher or a gentleman but to threaten with the rudeness  of a bear and to devour with the ferocity of a lion This perhaps may found harsh and uncourtly but it is too true and the more is the pity  I mention this only as her general character But towards America she has observed no character at all and destroyed by her conduct what she assumed in her title She set out with the title of Parent or Mother Country The association of ideas which naturally accompany this expression are filled with every thing that is fond tender and forbearing They have an energy particular to themselves and overlooking the accidental attachment of common affections apply with peculiar softness to the first feelings of the heart It is a political term which every mother can feel the force of and every child can judge of It needs no painting of mine to set it off for nature only can do it justice  But has any part of your conduct to America corresponded with the title you set up If in your general national character you are unpolished and severe in this you are inconsistent and unnatural and you must have exceeding false notions of national honour to suppose that the world can admire a want of humanity or that national honour depends on the violence of resentment the inflexibility of temper or the vengeance of execution  I would willingly convince you and that with as much temper as the times will suffer me to do  that as you opposed your own interest by quarrelling with us so likewise your national honour rightly conceived and understood was no ways called upon to enter into a war with America had you studied true greatness of heart the first and fairest ornament of mankind you would have acted directly contrary to all that you have done and the world would have ascribed it to a generous cause besides which you had though with the assistance of this country secured a powerful name by the last war You were known and dreaded abroad and it would have been wise in you to have suffered the world to have slept undisturbed under that idea It was to you a force existing without expence It produced to you all the advantages of real power and you were stronger through the universality of that charm than any future fleets and armies may probably make you Your greatness was so secured and interwoven with your silence that you ought never to have awakened mankind and had nothing to do but to be quiet Had you been true politicians you would have seen all this and continued to draw from the magic of a name the force and authority of a nation  Unwise as you were in breaking the charm you were still more unwise in the manner of doing of it Samson only told the secret but you have performed the operation you have shaven your own head and wantonly thrown away the locks America  was the hair from which the charm was drawn that infatuated the world You ought to have quarrelled with no power but with her upon no account You had nothing to fear from any condescension you might make You might have humoured her even if there had been no justice in her claims without any risk to your reputation for Europe fascinated by your same would have ascribed it to your benovolence and America intoxicated by the great would have slumbered in her fetters  But this method of studying the progress of the passions in order to ascertain the probable conduct of mankind is a philosophy in politics which those who preside at St James's have no conception of They know no other influence than corruption and reckon all their probabilities from precedent A new case is to them a new world and while they are seeking for a parallel they get lost The talents of Lord Mansfield can be estimated at best no higher than those of a sophist He understands the subtleties but not the elegance of nature and by continually viewing mankind through the cold medium of the law never thinks of penetrating into the warmer region of the mind As for Lord North it is his happiness to have in him more philosophy than sentiment for he bears flogging like a top and sleeps the better for it His punishment becomes his support for while he suffers the lash for his sins he keeps himself up by twirling about In  politics he is a good arithmetician and in every thing else nothing at all  There is one circumstance which comes so much within Lord North's province as a financier that I am surprised it should escape him which is the different abilities of the two countries in supporting the expence for strange as it may seem England is not a match for America in this particular By a curious kind of revolution in accounts the people of England seem to mistake their poverty for their riches that is they reckon their national debt as part of their national wealth They make the same kind of error which a man would do who after mortgaging his estate should add the money borrowed to the full value on the estate in order to count up his worth and in this case he would conceit that he got rich by running into debt Just thus it is with England The government owed at the beginning of this war one hundred and thirty five millions sterling and though the individuals to whom it was due had a right to reckon their shares as so much private property yet to the nation collectively it was so much poverty There is as effectual limits to public debts as to private ones for when once the money borrowed is so great as to require the whole yearly revenue to discharge the interest thereon there is an end to a farther borrowing in the same manner as when the interest of a man's debts amounts to the yearly income of  his estate there is an end to his credit This is nearly the case with England the interest of her present debt being at least equal to one half of her yearly revenue so that out of ten millions annually collected by taxes she has but five she can call her own  The very reverse of this was the case with America she began the war without any debt upon her and in order to carry it on she neither raised money by taxes nor borrowed it upon interest but created it and her situation at this time continues so much the reverse of yours that taxing would make her rich whereas it would make you poor When we shall have sunk the sum which we have created we shall then be out of debt be just as rich as when we began and all the while we are doing it shall feel no difference because the value will rise as the quantity decreases  There was not a country in the world so capable of bearing the expence of a war as America not only because she was not in debt when she began but because the country is young and capable of infinite improvement and has an almost boundless tract of new lands in store whereas England has got to her extent of age and growth and has no unoccupied land or property in reserve The one is like a young heir coming to a large improveable estate the other like an old man whose  chances are over and his estate mortgaged for half its worth  In the second number of the Crisis which I find has been republished in England I endeavoured to to set forth the impracticability of conquering America I stated every case that I conceived could possibly happen and ventured to predict its consequence As my conclusions were drawn not artfully but naturally they have all proved to be true I was upon the spot knew the politics of America her strength and resources and by a train of services the best in my power to render was honoured with the friendship of the congress▪ the army and the people I considered the cause a just one I know and feel it a just one and under that confidence never made my own profit or loss an object My endeavour was to have the matter well understood on both sides and I conceived myself tendering a general service by setting forth to the one the impossibility of being conquered and to the other the impossibility of conquering Most of the arguments made use of by the ministry for supporting the war are the very arguments that ought to have been used against supporting it and the plans by which they thought to conquer are the very plans in which they were sure to be defeated They have taken every thing up at the wrong end Their ignorance is astonishing and were you in my  situation you would see it They may perhaps have your confidence but I am persuaded they would make very indifferent members of congress I know what England is and what America is and from the compound of knowledge am better enabled to judge of the issue than what the king or any of his ministers can be  In this number I have endeavoured to shew the ill policy and disadvantages of the war I believe many of my remarks are new Those which are not so I have studied to improve and place in a manner that may be clear and striking Your failure is I am persuaded as certain as fate America is above your reach She is at least your equal in the world and her independance neither rests upon your consent or can be prevented by your arms In short you spend your substance in vain and impoverish yourself without a hope  But suppose you had conquered America what advantage collectively or individually as merchants manufacturers or conquerors could you have looked for This is an object you seem never to have attended to Listening for the sound of victory and led away by the phrenzy of arms you neglected to reckon either the cost or the consequences You must all pay towards the expence the poorest among you must bear his share and it is both your right and duty to weigh seriously the matter Had America been  conquered she might have been parcelled out in grants to the favourites at court but no share of it would have fallen to you Your taxes would not have been lessened because she would have been in no condition to have paid any towards your relief We are rich by a contrivance of our own which would have ceased as soon as you became masters Our Paper money will be of no use in England and silver and gold we have none In the last war you made many conquests but were any of your taxes lessened thereby On the contrary were you not taxed to pay for the charge of making them and have not the same been the case in every war  To the parliament I beg to address myself in a particular manner They appear to have supposed themselves partners in the chace and to have hunted with the lion from an expectation of a right in the booty but in this it is most probably they would as legislators have been disappointed The case is quite a new one and many unforeseen difficulties would have arisen thereon The parliament claimed a legislative right over America and the war originated from that pretence But the army is supposed to belong to the crown and if America had been conquered through their means the claims of the legislature would have been suffocated in the conquest Ceded or conquered countries are supposed to be out of the authority  of parliament Taxation is exercised over them by prerogative and not by law It was attempted to be done in the Grenades a few years ago and the only reason why it was not done was because the crown had made a prior relinquishment of its claim Therefore parliament have been all this while supporting measures for the establishment of their authority in the issue of which they would have been triumphed over by prerogative This might have opened a new and interesting opposition between the parliament and the crown The crown would have said that it conquered for itself and that to conquer for parliament was an unknown case The parliament might have replied that America not being a foreign country but a country in rebellion could not be said to be conquered but reduced and thus continued their claim by disowning the term The crown might have rejoined that however America might be considered at first she became foreign at last by a declaration of independence and a treaty with France and that her case being by that treaty put within the law of nations was out of the law of parliament The parliament might have maintained that as their claim over America had never been surrendered so neither could it be taken away The crown might have insisted that though the claim of parliament could not be taken away yet being an inferior might be  superceded and that whether the claim was withdrawn from the object or the object taken from the claim the same separation ensued and that America being subdued after a treaty with France was to all intents and purposes a regal conquest and of course the sole property of the king The parliament as the legal delegates of the people might have contended against the term "inferior" and rested the case upon the antiquity of power and this would have brought on a set of very interesting and rational questions  First What is the original fountain of power and honor in any country  Secondly Whether the prerogative does not belong to the people  Thirdly Whether there is any such thing as the English constitution  Fourthly Of what use is the crown to the people  Fifthly Whether he who invented a crown was not an enemy to mankind  Sixthly Whether it is not a shame for a man to spend a million a year and do no good for it and whether the money might not be better applied  Seventhly Whether such a man is not better dead than alive  Eighthly Whether a congress constituted like that of America is not the most happy and consistent  form of government in the world  With a number of others of the same import  In short the contention about the dividend might have distracted the nation for nothing is more common than to agree in the conquest and quarrel for the prize therefore it is perhaps a happy circumstance that our successes have prevented the dispute  If the parliament had been thrown out in their claim which it is most probable they would the nation likewise would have been thrown out in their expectation for as the taxes would have been laid by the crown without the parliament the revenue arising therefrom if any could have arose would not have gone into the exchequer but into the privy purse and so far from lessening the taxes would not even have been added to them but served only as pocket money to the crown The more I reflect on this matter the more I am astonished at the blindness and illpolicy of my countrymen whose wisdom seems to operate without discernment and their strength without an object  To the great bulwark of the nation I mean the mercantile and manufacturing part thereof I likewise present my address It is your interest to see America an independent country and not a conquered one If conquered she is ruined and if ruined poor consequently the trade will be a trifle and her credit doubtful If independent  she flourishes and from her flourishing must your profits arise It matters nothing to you who governs America if your manufactures find a consumption there Some articles will consequently be obtained from other places and right they should but the demand of others will increase by the great influx of inhabitants which a state of independence and peace will occasion and on the final event you may be enriched The commerce of America is perfectly free and ever will be so She will consign away no part of it to any nation She has not to her friends and certainly will not to her enemies though it is probable that your narrowminded politicians thinking to please you thereby may some time or other make such an unnecessary proposal Trade flourishes best when it is free and it is weak policy to attempt to fetter it Her treaty with France is on the most liberal and generous principles and the French in their conduct towards her have proved themselves to be philosophers politicians and gentlemen  To the ministry I likewise address myself You gentlemen have studied the ruin of your country from which it is not within your abilities to rescue her Your attempts to recover are as ridiculous as your plans which involved her are detestable The commissioners being about to depart will probably bring you this and with it my sixth number to them and in so doing they carry back more  COMMON SENSE than they brought and you will likewise have more than when you sent them  Having thus addressed you severally I conclude by addressing you collectively It is a long lane that has no turning A period of sixteen years of misconduct and misfortune is certainly long enough for any one nation to suffer under and upon a supposition that war is not declared between France and you I beg to place a line of conduct before you that will easily lead you out of all your troubles It has been hinted before and cannot be too much attended to  Suppose America had remained unknown to Europe till the present year and that Mr Banks and Dr Solander in another voyage round the world had made the first discovery of her in the self same condition she is now in of arts arms numbers and civilization What I ask in that case would have been your conduct towards her for THAT will point out what it ought to be now The problems and their solutions are equal and the right line of the one is the parallel of the other The question takes in every circumstance that can possibly arise It reduces politics to a simple thought and is moreover a mode of investigation in which while you are studying your interest the simplicity of the case will cheat you into good temper You have nothing to do but to suppose you have found America and she appears  found to your hand and while in the joy of your heart you stand still to admire her the path of politics rises straight before you  Were I disposed to paint a contrast I could easily set off what you have done in the present case against what you would have done in THAT case and by justly opposing them conclude a picture that would make you blush But as when any of the prouder passions are hurt it is much better philosophy to let a man slip into a good temper than to attack him in a bad one for that reason therefore I only state the case and leave yourselves to reflect upon it  To go a little back into politics it will be found that the true interests of Britain lay in proposing and promoting the independence of America immediately after the last peace for the expence which Britain had then incurred by defending America as her own dominions ought to have shewn her the policy and necessity of changing the STILE of the country as the best probable method of preventing future wars and expence and the only method by which she could hold the commerce without the charge of sovereignty Besides which the title she assumed of parent country led to and pointed out the propriety wisdom and advantage of a separation for as in private life children grow into men and by setting up for themselves extend and secure the interest of the whole family so in the  settlement of colonies large enough to admit of maturity the same policy should be pursued and the same consequences would follow Nothing hurts the affections both of parents and children so much as living too closely connected and keeping up the distinction too long Domineering will not do over those who by a progress in life are become equal in rank to their parents that is when they have families of their own and though they may conceive themselves the subjects of their advice will not suppose them the objects of their government I do not by drawing this parallel mean to admit the title of PARENT COUNTRY because if due any where it is due to Europe collectively and the first settlers from England were driven here by prosecution I mean only to introduce the term for the sake of policy and to show from your title the line of your interest  When you saw the state of strength and opulence and that by her own industry which America had arrived at you ought to have advised her to have set up for herself and proposed an alliance of interest with her and in so doing you would have drawn and that at her own expence more real advantage and more military supplies and assistance both of ships and men than from any weak and wrangling government you could exercise over her In short had you studied only the domestic politics  of a family you would have learned how to govern the state but instead of this easy and natural line you flew out into every thing which was wild and outrageous till by following the passion and stupidity of the pilot you wrecked the vessel within sight of the shore  Having shown what you ought to have done I now proceed to shew the reason why it was not done The caterpillar circle of the court had an interest to pursue distinct from and opposed to yours for though by the independence of America and an alliance therewith the trade would have continued if not increased as in many articles neither country can go to a better market and though by defending and protecting herself she would have been no expence to you and consequently your national charges would have decreased and your taxes might have been proportionally lessened thereby yet the striking off so many places from the court calendar was put in opposition to the interest of the nation The loss of thirteen government ships with their appendages here and in England is a shocking sound in the ear of a hungry courtier  Your present king and minister will be the ruin of you and you had better risk a revolution and call a congress than be thus led on from madness to despair and from despair to ruin America has set you the example and may you follow it and be sree  I now come to the last parta war with France This is what no man in his senses will advise you to and all good men would wish to prevent Whether France will declare war against you is not for me in this place to mention or to hint even if I knew it but it must be madness in you to do it first The matter is now come to a full crisis and peace is easy if willingly set about Whatever you may think France has behaved handsomely to you She would have been unjust to herself to have acted otherwise than she did and having accepted our offer of alliance she gave you genteel notice of it There was nothing in her conduct reserved or indelicate and while she announced her determination to support her treaty she left you to give the first offence America on her part has exhibited a character of firmness to the world Unprepared and unarmed without form or government she singly opposed a nation that domineered over half the globe The greatness of the deed demands respect and though you may feel resentment you are compelled both to WONDER and ADMIRE  Here I rest my arguments and finish my address such as it is it is a gift and you are welcome It was always my design to dedicate a CRISIS to you when the time should come that would properly MAKE IT A CRISIS and when likewise I should catch myself in a temper to write it and  suppose you in a condition to read it THAT time is now arrived and with it the opportunity of conveyance For the commissionersPOOR COMMISSIONERS having proclaimed that "YET FORTY DAYS AND NINEVEH SHALL BE OVERTHROWN" have waited out the date and discontented with their God are returning to their gourd And all the harm I wish them is that it may not WITHER about their cars and that they may not make their exit in the belly of a whale  COMMON SENSE  PS Though in the tranquility of my mind I have concluded with a laugh yet I have something to mention to the COMMISSIONERS which to them is serious and worthy their attention Their authority is derived from an act of parliament which likewise describes and LIMITS their OFFICIAL powers Their commission therefore is only a recital and personal investiture of those powers or a nomination and description of the persons who are to execute them Had it contained any thing contrary to or gone beyond the line of the written law from which it is derived and by which it is bound it would by the English constitution have been treason in the crown and the king been subject to an impeachment He dared not therefore put in his commission what you  have put in your proclamation that is he dared not have authorised you in that commission to burn and destroy or to threaten to burn and destroy any thing in America You are both in the ACT and in the COMMISSION stiled COMMISSIONERS FOR RESTORING PEACE and the methods for doing it are there pointed out Your last proclamation is signed by you as commissioners UNDER THAT ACT You make parliament the patron of its contents Yet in the body of it you insert matters contrary both to the spirit and letter of the act and what likewise your king dared not have put in his commission to you The state of things in England gentlemen is too ticklish for you to run hazards You are ACCOUNTABLE TO PARLIAMENT FOR THE EXECUTION OF THAT ACT ACCORDING TO THE LETTER OF IT Your heads may pay for breaking it for you certainly have broke it by exceeding it And as a friend who would wish you to escape the paw of the lion as well as the belly of the whale I civilly hint to you TO KEEP WITHIN COMPASS  Sir Harry Clinton strictly speaking is as accountable as the rest though a general he is likewise a commissioner acting under a superior authority His first obedience is to the act and his plea of being a general will not and cannot clear him as a commissioner for that would suppose the crown  in its single capacity to have the power of dispensing with a single act of parliament Your situations gentlemen are nice and critical and the more so because England is unsettled Take heed Remember the times of Charles the First For Laud and Stafford fell by trusting to a hope like yours  Having thus shewn you the danger of your proclamation I now shew you the folly of it The means contradict the design You threaten to lay waste in order to render America a useless acquisition of alliance to France I reply that the more destruction you commit if you could do it the more valuable to France you make that alliance You can destroy only houses and goods and by so doing you encrease our demand upon her for materials and merchandize for the wants of one nation provided it has FREEDOM and CREDIT naturally produces riches to the other and as you can neither ruin the land nor prevent the vegetation you would encrease the exportation of our produce in payment which to her would be a new fund of wealth In short had you cast about for a plan on purpose to enrich your enemies you could not have hit upon a better  C S  THE CRISIS  No IX  Addressed to the People of England  "TRUSTING says the king of England in his speech of November last in the Divine Providence and in the justice of my cause I am firmly resolved to prosecute the war with vigour and to make every exertion in order to compel our enemies to equitable terms of peace and accommodation" To this declaration the United States of America and the confederated powers of Europe will reply  if Britain will have war    she shall have enough of it  Five years have nearly elapsed since the commencement of hostilities and every campaign by a gradual decay has lessened your ability to conquer without producing a serious thought on your condition or your fate Like a prodigal lingering in an habitual consumption you feel the relics of life and mistake them for recovery New schemes like  new medicines have administered fresh hopes and prolonged the disease instead of curing it A change of generals like a change of physicians served only to keep the flattery alive and furnish new pretences for new extravagance  "Can Britain fail  Whitehead's New Year's Ode    " Has been proudly asked at the commencement of every enterprize and that  "whatever she wills is fate  Ode at the installation of lord North for chancellor of the University of Oxford  " has been given with the solemnity of prophetic confidence and though the question has been constantly replied to by disappointment and the prediction falsified by misfortune yet still the insult continued and your catalogue of national evils encreased therewith Eager to persuade the world of her power she considered destruction as the minister of greatness and conceived that the glory of a nation like that of an Indian lay in the number of its scalps and the miseries it inflicts  Fire sword and want as far as the arms of Britain could extend them have been spread with wanton cruelty along the coast of America and while you remote from the scene of suffering had nothing to lose and as little to dread the information reached you like a tale of antiquity in which the distance of time defaces the conception and  changes the severest sorrows into conversable amusement  This makes the second paper addressed perhaps in vain to the people of England That advice should be taken wherever example has failed or precept be regarded where warning is ridiculed is like a picture of hope resting on despair But when time shall stamp with universal currency the facts you have long encountered with a laugh and the irresistable evidence of accumulated losses like the hand writing on the wall shall add terror to distress you will then in a conflict of sufferings learn to sympathize with others by feeling for yourselves  The triumphant appearance of the combined fleets in the channel and at your harbour's mouth and the expedition of captain Paul Jones on the western and eastern coast of England and Scotland will by placing you in the condition of an endangered country read to you a stronger lecture on the calamities of invasion and bring to your minds a truer picture of promiscuous distress than the most finished rhetoric can describe or the keenest imagination can conceive  Hitherto you have experienced the expences but nothing of the miseries of war Your disappointments have been accompanied with no immediate suffering and your losses came to you only by intelligence Like fire at a distance you heard  not even the cry you felt not the danger you saw not the confusion To you every thing has been foreign but the taxes to support it You knew not what it was to be alarmed at midnight with an armed enemy in the streets You were strangers to the distressing scene of a family in flight and the thousand restless cares and tender sorrows that incessantly arose To see women and children wandering in the severity of winter with the broken remains of a well furnished house and seeking shelter in every crib and hut were matters you had no conception of You knew not what it was to stand by and see your goods chopt up for fuel and your beds ript to pieces to make packages for plunder The misery of others like a tempestuous night added to the pleasures of your own security You even enjoyed the storm by contemplating the difference of conditions and that which carried sorrow into the breast of thousands served but to heighten in you a species of tranquil prideYet these are but the fainter sufferings of war when compared with carnage and slaughter the miseries of a military hospital or a town in flames  The people of America by anticipating distress had fortified their minds against every species you could inflict They had resolved to abandon their homes to resign them to destruction and to seek new settlements rather than submit Thus familiarized to misfortune before it arrived they  bore their portion with less regret The justness of their cause was a continual source of consolation and the hope of final victory which never left them served to lighten the load and sweeten the cup allotted them to drink  But when their suffering shall become yours and invasion be transferred to the invaders you will have neither an extended wilderness to fly to their cause to comfort you nor their hopes to rest on Distress with them was sharpened with no selfreflection They had not brought it on themselves On the contrary they had by every proceeding endeavoured to avoid it and had descended even below the mark of congressional character to prevent a war The national honour or the advantages of independence were matters which at the commencement of the dispute they had never studied and it was only at the last moment that the measure was resolved on Thus circumstanced they naturally and conscientiously felt a dependance upon Providence They had a clear pretention to it and had they failed therein infidelity had gained a triumph  But your condition is the reverse of theirs Every thing you suffer you have sought nay had you created mischiefs on purpose to inherit them you could not have secured your title by a firmer deed The world awakens with no pity at your complaints You felt none for others you deserve  none for yourselves Nature doth not interest herself in cases like yours but on the contrary turns from them with dislike and abandons them to punishment You may now present memorials to what court you please but so far as America is the object none will listen The policy of Europe and the propensity there isin every mind to curb insulting ambition and bring cruelty to judgment are unitedly against you and where nature and interest reinforces each other the compact is too intimate to be dissolved  Make but the case of others your own and your own theirs and you will then have a clear idea of the whole Had France acted towards her colonies as you have done you would have branded her with every epithet of abhorrence and had you like her stept in to succour a struggling people all Europe must have echoed with your own applauses But entangled in the passion of dispute you see it not as you ought and form opinions thereon which suit with no interest but your own You wonder America does not rise in union with you to impose on herself a portion of your taxes and reduce herself to unconditional submission You are amazed that the southern powers of Europe do not assist you in conquering a country which is afterwards to be turned against themselves and that the northern ones do not contribute to reinstate you in America who already enjoy the market for  naval stores by the separation You seem surprized that Holland does not pour in her succours to maintain you mistress of the seas when her own commerce is suffering by your act of navigation or that any country should study her own interests while yours is on the carpet  Such excesses of passionate folly and unjust as well as unwise resentment have driven you on like Pharoah to unpitied miseries and while the importance of the quarrel shall perpetuate your disgrace the flag of America will carry it round the world The natural feelings of every rational being will take against you and wherever the story shall be told you will have neither excuse nor consolation left With an unsparing hand and an unsatiable mind you have havocked the world both to gain dominion and to lose it and while in a phrenzy of avarice and ambition the east and the west are doomed to tributary bondage you rapidly earned destruction as the wages of a nation  At the thoughts of a war at home every man amongst you ought to tremble The prospect is far more dreadful there than in America Here the party that was against the measures of the continent were in general a kind of neutrals who added strength to neither army There does not exist a being so devoid of sense and sentiment as to covet "UNCONDITIONAL SUBMISSION" and therefore no man in America could be with you in  principle Several might from a cowardice of mind PREFER it to the hardships and dangers of OPPOSING it but the same disposition that gave them such a choice unfitted them to act either for or against But England is rent into parties with equal shares of resolution The principle which produced the war divides the nation Their animosities are in the highest state of fermentation and both sides by a call of the militia are in arms No human foresight can discern no conclusion can be formed what turn a war might take if once set on by an invasion She is not now in a fit disposition to make a common cause of her own affairs and having no conquests to hope for abroad and nothing but expences arising at home her every thing is staked upon a defensive combat and the further she goes the worse she is off  There are situations a nation may be in in which peace or war abstracted from every other consideration may be politically right or wrong When nothing can be lost by a war but what must be lost without it war is then the policy of that country and such was the situation of America at the commencement of hostilities But when no security can be gained by a war but what may be accomplished by a peace the cafe becomes reversed and such now is the situation of England  That America is beyond the reach of conquest is a fact which experience has shewn and time confirmed and this admitted what I ask is now the  object of contention If there be any honour in pursuing selfdestruction with inflexible passion if national suicide be the perfection of national glory you may with all the pride of criminal happiness expire unenvied and unrivalledBut when the tumult of war shall cease and the tempest of present passions be succeeded by calm reflection or when those who surviving its fury shall inherit from you a legacy of debts and misfortunes when the yearly revenue shall scarcely be able to discharge the interest of the one and no possible remedy be left for the other Ideas far different to the present will arise and embitter the remembrance of former follies A mind disarmed of its rage feels no pleasure in contemplating a frantic quarrel Sickness of thought the sure consequence of conduct like yours leaves no ability for enjoyment no relish for resentment and though like a man in a fit you feel not the injury of the struggle nor distinguish between strength and disease the weakness will nevertheless be proportioned to the violence and the sense of pain encrease with the recovery  To what persons or to whose system of politics you owe your present state of wretchedness is a matter of total indifference to America They have contributed however unwillingly to set her above themselves and she in the tranquillity of conquest resigns the enquiry The case now is not so properly who began the war as who continues it That there are men in all countries to  whom a state of war is a mine of wealth is a fact never to be doubted Characters like these naturally breed in the putrefaction of distempered times and after fattening on the disease they perish with it or impregnated with the stench retreat into obscurity  But there are several erroneous notions to which you likewise owe a share of your misfortunes and which if continued will only increase your trouble and your losses An opinion hangs about the gentlemen of the minority that America would relish measures under THEIR administration which she would not from the present cabinet On this rock lord Chatham would have split had he gained the helm and several of his survivors are steering the same course Such distinctions in the infancy of the argument had some degree of foundation but they now serve no other purpose than to lengthen out a war in which the limits of the dispute being fixt by the fate of arms and guarantied by treaties are not to be changed or altered by trivial circumstances  The ministry and many of the minority sacrifice their time in disputing on a question with which they have nothing to do namely whether America shall be independent or not Whereas the only question that can come under their determination is whether they will accede to it or not They confound a military question with a political one  and undertake to supply by a vote what they lost by a battle Say she shall not be independent and it will signify as much as if they voted against a decree of fate or say that she shall and she will be no more independent than before Questions which when determined cannot be executed serve only to shew the folly of dispute and the weakness of the disputants  From a long habit of calling America your own you suppose her governed by the same prejudices and conceits which govern yourselves Because you have set up a particular denomination of religion to the exclusion of all others you imagine she must do the same and because you with an unsociable narrowness of mind have cherished against France and Spain you suppose her alliance must be defective in friendship Copying her notions of the world from you she formerly thought as you instructed but now feeling herself free and the prejudice removed she thinks and acts upon a different system It frequently happens that in proportion as we are taught to dislike persons and countries not knowing why we feel an ardour of esteem upon a removal of the mistake It seems as if something was to be made amends for and we eagerly give into every office of friendship to atone for the injury of the error  But perhaps there is something in the extent of countries which among the generality of people insensibly communicates extension of the mind The soul of an islander in its native state seems bounded by the foggy confines of the water's edge and all beyond affords to him matters only for profit or curiositynot for friendship His island is to him his world and fixt to that his every thing centers in it while those who are inhabitants of a continent by casting their eye over a larger field take in likewise a larger intellectual circuit and thus approaching nearer to an acquaintance with the universe their atmosphere of thought is extended and their liberality fills a wider space In short our minds seem to be measured by countries when we are men as they are by places when we are children and until something happens to disentangle us from the prejudice we serve under it without perceiving it  In addition to this it may be remarked that men who study any universal science the principles of which are universally known or admitted and applied without distinction to the common benefit of all countries obtain thereby a larger share of philanthropy than those who only study national arts and improvements Natural philosophy mathematics and astronomy carry the mind from the country to the creation and give it a fitness  suited to the extent It was not Newton's honour neither could it be his pride that he was an Englishman but that he was a philosopher The Heavens had liberated him from the prejudices of an island and science had expanded his soul as boundless as his studies  Philadelphia  March  THE CRISIS  No X  HAD America pursued her advantages with half the spirit she resisted her misfortunes she would before now have been a conquering and a peaceful people but lulled in the lap of soft tranquillity she rested on her hopes and adversity only has convulsed her into action Whether subtlety or sincerity at the close of the last year induced the enemy to an appearance for peace is a point not material to know it sufficient that we see the effects it has had on our politics and that we sternly rise to resent the delusion  The war on the part of America has been a war of natural feelings Brave in distress serene in conquest drowsy while at rest and in every situation generously disposed to peace A dangerous calm and a most heightened zeal have as circumstances varied succeeded each other Every passion but that of despair has been called to a tour of duty and so mistaken has been the enemy  of our abilities and disposition that when she supposed us conquered we rose the conquerors The extensiveness of the United States and the variety of their resources the universality of their cause the quick operation of their feelings and the similarity of their sentiments have in every trying situation produced  a something  which favoured by Providence and pursued with ardour has accomplished in an instant the business of a campaign We have never deliberately sought victory but snatched it and bravely undone in an hour the plotted operations of a season  The reported fate of Charlestown like the misfortunes of seventysix has at last called forth a spirit and kindled up a flame which perhaps no other event could have produced If the enemy has circulated a falshood they have unwisely aggravated us into life and if they have told us a truth they have unintentionally done us a service We were returning with folded arms from the fatigues of war and thinking and setting leisurely down to enjoy repose The dependance that has been put upon Charlestown threw a drowsiness over America We looked on the business done The conflict overthe matter settledor that all which remained unfinished would follow of itself In this state of dangerous relax exposed to the poisonous insusions of the enemy and having  no common danger to attract our attention we were extinguishing by stages the ardour we began with and surrendering by piece meals the virtue that defended us  Afflicting as the loss of Charlestown may be yet if it universally rouze us from the slumber of a twelvemonths past and renew in us the spirit of former days it will produce an advantage more important than its loss America ever  is  what she  thinks  herself to be Governed by sentiment and acting her own mind she becomes as she pleases the victor or the victim  It is not the conquest of towns nor the accidental capture of garrisons that can reduce a country so extensive as this The sufferings of one part can ever be relieved by the exertions of another and there is no situation the enemy can be in that does not afford to us the same advantages she seeks herself By dividing her force she leaves every post attackable It is a mode of war that carries with it a confession of weakness and goes on the principle of distress rather than conquest  The decline of the enemy is visible not only in their operations but in their plans Charlestown originally made but a secondary object in the system of attack and it is now become their principal one because they have not been able to succeed elsewhere It would have carried a cowardly appearance  in Europe had they formed their grand expedition in seventysix against a part of the continent where there was no army or not a sufficient one to oppose them but failing year after year in their impressions here and to the eastward and northward they deserted their first capital design and prudently contenting themselves with what they can get give a flourish of honour to conceal disgrace  But this piecemeal work is not conquering the continent It is a discredit in them to attempt it and in us to suffer it It is now full time to put an end to a war of aggravations which on one side has no possible object and on the other has every inducement which honour interest safety and happiness can inspire If we suffer them much longer to remain among us we shall become as bad as themselves An association of vices will reduce us more than the sword A nation hardened in the practice of iniquity knows better how to profit by it than a young country newly corrupted We are not a match for them in the line of advantageous guilt nor they to us on the principles we bravely set out with Our first days were our days of honour They have marked the character of America wherever the story of her wars are told and convinced of this we have nothing to do but wisely and unitedly to tread the well known track  The progress of a war is often as ruinous to individuals as the issue of it is to a nation and it is not only necessary that our forces be such that we be conquerors in the end but that by timely exertions we be secure in the interim The present campaign will afford an opportunity which has never presented itself before and the preparations for it are equally necessary whether Charlstown stand or fall Suppose the first it is in that case only a failure of the enemy not a defeat All the conquest a besieged town can hope for is not to be conquered and compelling an enemy to raise the siege is to the besieged a victory But there must be a probability amounting almost to certainty that would justify a garrison marching out to attack a retreat Therefore should Charlestown not be taken and the enemy abandon the siege every other part of the continent should prepare to meet them and on the contrary should it be taken the same preparations are necessary to balance the loss and put ourselves in a condition to cooperate with our allies immediately on their arrival  We are not now fighting our battles alone as we were in seventy six England from a malicious disposition to America has not only not declared war against France and Spain but the better to prosecute her passions here has afforded those two powers no military object and avoids them to distress us She will suffer her West India islands  to be overrun by France and her southern settlements taken by Spain rather than quit the object that gratifies revenge This conduct on the part of Britain has pointed out the propriety of France sending a naval and land force to co operate with America on the spot Their arrival cannot be very distant nor the ravages of the enemy long In the mean time the part necessary to us needs no illustration The recruiting the army and procuring the supplies are the two things needful and a capture of either of the enemy's divisions will restore to America peace and plenty  At a crisis big like the present with expectation and events the whole country is called to unanimity and exertion Not an ability ought now to sleep that can produce but a mite to the general good nor even a whisper to pass that militates against it The necessity of the case and the importance of the consequences admit no delay from a friend no apology from an enemy To spare now would be the height of extravagance and to consult present ease would be to sacrifice it perhaps for ever  America rich in patriotism and produce can want neither men nor supplies when a serious necessity call them forth The slow operation of taxes owing to the extensiveness of collection and their depreciated value before they arrived in the treasury have in many instances thrown a burthen  upon government which has been artfully interpreted by the enemy into a general decline throughout the country Yet this inconvenient as it may at first appear is not only remediable but may be turned to an immediate advantage for it makes no real difference whether a certain number of men or company of militia and in this country every man is a militia man are directed by law to send a recruit at their own expence or whether a tax is laid on them for that purpose and the man hired by government afterwards The first if there is any difference is both cheapest and best because it saves the expence which would attend collecting it as a tax and brings the man sooner into the field than the modes of recruiting formerly used And on this principle a law has been passed in this state for recruiting two men from each company of militia which will add upwards of a thousand to the force of the country  But the flame which has broke forth in this city since the report from New York of the loss of Charlestown not only does honour to the place but like the blaze of seventysix will kindle into action the scattered sparks throughout America The valour of a country may be learned by the bravery of its soldiery and the general cast of its inhabitants but confidence of success is best discovered by the active measures pursued by men of property and when the spirit of enterprize becomes so universal  as to act at once on all ranks of men a war may then and not till then be stiled truly popular  In seventysix the ardour of the enterprising part was considerably checked by the real revolt of some and the coolness of others But in the present case there is a firmness in the substance and property of the country to the public cause An association has been entered into by the merchants tradesmen and the principal inhabitants of this city to receive and support the new state money at the value of gold and silver a measure which while it does them honour will likewise contribute to their interest by rendering the operations of the campaign convenient and effectual  Neither has the spirit of exertion stopt here A voluntary subscription is likewise began to raise a fund of hard money to be given as bounties to fill up the full quota of the Pennsylvania line It has been the remark of the enemy that every thing in America has been done by the force of government but when she sees individuals throwing in their voluntary aids and facilitating the public measures in concert with the established powers of the country it will convince her that the cause of America stands not on the will of a few but on the broad foundation of property and popularity  Thus aided and thus supported disaffection will decline and the withered head of tyranny expire  in America The ravages of the enemy will be short and limited and like all their former ones will produce a victory over themselves  COMMON SENSE  ☞ At the time of writing this number of the Crisis the loss of Charlestown though believed by some was more confidently disbelieved by others But there ought to be no longer a doubt on the matter Charlestown is gone and I believe for the want of a sufficient supply of provisions The man that does not now feel for the honour of the best and noblest cause that ever a country engaged in and exert himself accordingly is no longer worthy a peaceable residence among a people determined to be free  C S  THE CRISIS EXTRAORDINARY  On the Subject of Taxation  IT is impossible to sit down and think seriously on the affairs of America but the original principles on which she resisted and the glow and ardour they inspired will occur like the undefaced remembrance of a lovely scene To trace over in imagination the purity of the cause the voluntary sacrifices made to support it and all the various turnings of the war in its defence is at once both paying and receiving respect The principles deserve to be remembered and to remember them rightly is repossessing them In this indulgence of generous recollection we become gainers by what we seem to give and the more we bestow the richer we become  So extensively right was the ground on which America proceeded that it not only took in every just and liberal sentiment which could impress the heart but made it the direct interest of every class and order of men to defend the country The war  on the part of Britain was originally a war of covetousness The sordid and not the splendid passions gave it being The fertile fields and prosperous infancy of America appeared to her as mines for tributary wealth She viewed the hive and disregarding the industry that had enriched it thirsted for the honey But in the present stage of her affairs the violence of temper is added to the rage of avarice and therefore that which at the first setting out proceeded from purity of principle and public interest is now heightened by all the obligations of necessity for it requires but little knowledge of human nature to discern what would be the consequence were America again reduced to the subjection of Britain Uncontrouled power in the hands of an incensed imperious and rapacious conqueror is an engine of dreadful execution and woe be to that country over which it can be exercised The names of whig and tory would then be sunk in the general term of rebel and the oppression whatever it might be would with very few instances of exception light equally on all  Britain did not go to war with America for the sake of dominion because she was then in possession neither was it for the extension of trade and commerce because she had monopolized the whole and the country had yielded to it neither was it to extinguish what  she  might call rebellion because before she began no resistance existed It could  then be from no other motive than avarice or a design of establishing in the first instance the same taxes in America as are paid in England which as I shall presently shew are above eleven times heavier than the taxes we now pay for the present year or in the second instance to confiscate the whole property of America in case of resistance and conquest of the latter of which she had then no doubt  I shall now proceed to shew what the taxes in England are and what the yearly expence of the present war is to herWhat the taxes of this country amount to and what the annual expence of defending it effectually will be to us and shall endeavour concisely to point out the cause of our difficulties and the advantages on one side and the consequences on the other in case we do or do not put ourselves in an effectual state of defence I mean to be open candid and sincere I see a universal wish to expel the enemy from the country a murmuring because the war is not carried on with more vigour and my intention is to shew as shortly as possible both the reason and the remedy  The number of souls in England exclusive of Scotland and Ireland is seven millions  This is taking the highest number that the people of England have been or can be rated at  and the number of souls in America is three millions  The amount of the taxes in England exclusive of Scotland and Ireland was before the present war commenced eleven millions six hundred and fortytwo thousand six hundred and fiftythree pounds sterling which on an average is no less a sum than one pound thirteen shillings and three pence sterling per head per annum men women and children besides county taxes taxes for the support of the poor and a tenth of all the produce of the earth for the support of the bishops and the clergy  The following is taken from Dr Price's state of the taxes of England pages  An account of the money drawn from the public by taxes annually being the medium of three years before the year  Amount of customs in England  £  Amount of the excise in England    Land tax at s    Land tax at s in the pound    Salt duties    Duties on stamps cards dice advertisements bonds leases newspapers almanacks c    Duties on houses and windows    Post office seizures wine licence hackney coaches c    Annual profits from lotteries    Expence of collecting the excises in England    Expence of collecting the customs in England    Carried over £    Brought forward £    Interest of loans on the land tax at s Expences of collection militia c    Perquisites c on custom house officers c supposed    Expence of collecting the salt duties in England ½ per cent    Bounties on fish exported    Expence of collecting the duties on stamps cards advertisements c at ¼ per cent    Total  £  Nearly five millions of this sum went  annually to pay the interest of the national debt contracted by former wars and the remaining sum of six millions six hundred and forty two thousand six hundred pounds was applied to defray the yearly expence of government the peace establishment of the army and navy placemen and pensioners c consequently the whole of her enormous taxes being thus appropriated she had nothing to spare out of them towards defraying the expences of the present war or any other Yet had she not been in debt at the beginning of the war as we were not and like us had only a land and not a naval war to carry on her then revenue of eleven millions and a half pounds sterling would then defray all her annual expences of war and government within each year  But this not being the case with her she is obliged to borrow about ten million pounds sterling  yearly to prosecute the war she is now engaged in this year she borrowed twelve and lay on new taxes to discharge the interest and allowing that the present war has cost her only fifty millions sterling the interest thereon at five per cent will be two millions and an half therefore the amount of her taxes now must be fourteen millions which on an average is not less than forty shillings sterling per head men women and children throughout the nation Now as this expence of fifty millions was borrowed on the hopes of conquering America and as it was Avarice which first induced her to commence the war how truly wretched and deplorable would the condition of this country be were she by her own remissness to suffer an enemy of such a disposition and so circumstanced to reduce her to subjection  I now proceed to the revenues of America  I have already stated the number of souls in America to be three millions and by a calculation I have made which I have every reason to believe is sufficiently right the whole expence of the war and the support of the several governments may be defrayed for two million pounds sterling annually which on an average is thirteen shillings and four pence per head men women and children and the peace establishment at the end of the war will be but three quarters of a million or five shillings sterling per  head Now throwing out of the question every thing of honour principle happiness freedom and reputation in the world and taking it up on the simple ground of interest I put the following case  Suppose Britain was to conquer America and as conquerors was to lay her under no other conditions than to pay the same proportions towards her annual revenue which the people of England pay our share in that case would be six million pounds sterling yearly can it then be a question whether it is best to raise two millions to defend the country and govern it ourselves and only three quarters of a million afterwards or pay six millions to have it conquered and let the enemy govern it  Can it be supposed that conquerors would chuse to put themselves in a worse condition than what they granted to the conquered In England the tax on rum is five shillings and one penny sterling per gallon which is one silver dollar and fourteen coppers Now would it not be laughable to imagine that after the expence they have been at they would let either whig or tory in America drink it cheaper than themselves Coffee which is so considerable an article of consumption and support here is there loaded with a duty which makes the price between five and six shillings sterling a pound and a penalty of fifty pounds sterling on any person detected  in roasting it in his own house There is scarce an article of life you can eat drink wear or enjoy that is not there loaded with a tax even the light from heaven is only permited to shine into their dwellings by paying eighteen pence sterling per window annually and the humblest drink of life small beer cannot there be purchased without a tax of nearly two coppers a gallon besides a heavy tax upon the malt and another on the hops before it is brewed exclusive of a land tax on the earth which produces them In short the condition of that country in point of taxation is so oppressive the number of her poor so great and the extravagance and rapaciousness of the court so enormous that were they to effect a conquest of America it is then only that the distresses of America would begin Neither would it signify any thing to a man whether he be whig or tory The people of England and the ministry of that country know us by no such distinctions What they want is clear solid revenue and the modes they would take to procure it would operate alike on all Their manner of reasoning would be short because they would naturally infer that if we were able to carry on a war of five or six years against them we were able to pay the same taxes which they do  I have already stated that the expence of conducting the present war and the government of the several states may be done for two millions sterling  and the establishment in time of peace for three quarters of a million  I have made the calculations in sterling because it is a rate generally known in all the states and because likewise it admits of an easy comparison between our expences to support the war and those of the enemy Four silver dollars and an half is one pound sterling and three pence over    As to navy matters they flourish so well and are so well attended in the hands of individuals that I think it consistent on every principle of real use and oeconomy to turn the navy into hard money keeping only three or four packets and apply it to promote the service of the army We shall not have a ship the less the use of them and the benefit from them will be greatly increased and their expence saved We are now allied to a formidable naval power from whom we derive the assistance of a navy And the line in which we can prosecute the war so as to reduce the common enemy and benefit the alliance most effectually will be by attending closely to the land service  I estimate the charge of keeping up and maintaining an army officering them and all expences included sufficient for the defence of the country to be equal to the expence of forty thousand men at thirty pounds sterling per head which is one million two hundred thousand pounds  I likewise allow four hundred thousand pounds for continental expences at home and abroad  And four hundred thousand pounds for the support of the several state governments the amount will then be  For the army    Continental expences at home and abroad    Government of the several states    Total    I take the proportion of this state Pennsylvania to be an eighth part of the thirteen United States the quota then for us to raise will be two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling two hundred thousand of which will be our share for the support and pay of the army and continental expences at home and abroad and fifty thousand pounds for the support of state government  In order to gain an idea of the proportion in which the raising such a sum will fall I make the following calculation  Pennsylvania contains three hundred and seventy five thousand inhabitants men women and children which is likewise an eighth of the whole inhabitants of the whole United States therefore two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling to be raised among three hundred and seventy five thousand persons is on an average thirteen shillings  and four pence sterling per head per annum or something more than one shilling sterling per month And our proportion of three quarters of a million for the government of the country in time of peace will be ninety three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds sterling fifty thousand of which will be for the government expences of the state and forty three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds for continental expences at home and abroad  The peace establishment then will on an average be five shillings sterling per head Whereas was England now to stop and the war to cease her peace establishment would continue the same as it is now viz forty shillings per head therefore was our taxes necessary for carrying on the war as much per head as her's now is and the difference to be only whether we should at the end of the war pay at the rate of five shillings per head or forty shillings per head the case needs no thinking of But as we can securely defend and keep the country for one third less than what our burthen would be if it was conquered and support the governments afterwards for one eighth of what Britain would levy on us and could I find a miser whose heart never felt the emotion of a spark of princiciple even that man uninfluenced by every love but the love of money and capable of no attachment but to his interest would and must from the frugality which governs him contribute to the defence  of the country or he ceases to be a miser and becomes an ideot But when we take in with it every thing that can ornament mankind when the line of our interest becomes the line of our happiness when all that can cheer and animate the heart when sense of honour fame character at home and abroad are interwoven not only with the security but the increase of property there exists not a man in America unless he be a hired emissary who does not see that his good is connected with keeping up a sufficient defence  I do not imagine that an instance can be produced in the world of a country putting herself to such an amazing charge to conquer and enslave another as Britain has done The sum is too great for her to think of with any tolerable degree of temper and when we consider the burthen she sustains as well as the disposition she has shewn it would be the height of folly in us to suppose that she would not reimburse herself by the most rapid means had she once more America within her power With such an oppression of expence what would an empty conquest be to her what relief under such circumstances could she derive from a victory without a prize It was money it was revenue she first went to war for and nothing but  that  would satisfy her It is not the nature of avarice to be satisfied with any thing else Every passion that acts upon mankind has a peculiar mode of operation Many of them are temporary and  fluctuating they admit of cessation and variety But avarice is a fixed uniform passion It neither abates of its vigour nor changes its object and the reason why it does not is founded on the nature of things for wealth has not a rival where avarice is a ruling passion One beauty may excel another and extinguish from the mind of a man the pictured remembrance of a former one But wealth is the phoenix of avarice and therefore cannot seek a new object because there is not another in the world  I now pass on to shew the value of the present taxes and compare them with the annual expence but this I shall preface with a few explanatory remarks  There are two distinct things which make the payment of taxes difficult the one is the large and real value of the sum to be paid and the other is the scarcity of the thing in which the payment is to be made and although these appear to be one and the same they are in several instances not only different but the difficulty springs from different causes  Suppose a tax was to be laid equal to one half of what a man's yearly income is such a tax could not be paid because the property could not be spared and on the other hand suppose a very trifling tax was laid to be collected in  pearls  such a tax likewise could not be paid because it could not be had Now any person may see that these  are distinct cases and the latter of them is a representation of ours  That the difficulty cannot proceed from the former that is from the real value or weight of the tax is evident at first view to any person who will consider it  The amount of the quota of taxes for this state for the present year and so on in proportion for every other state is twenty millions of dollars which at seventy for one is but sixty four thousand two hundred and eighty pounds three shillings sterling and on an average is no more than three shillings and five pence sterling per head per annum per man woman and child or ⅖ pence per head per month Now here is a clear positive fact that cannot be contradicted and which proves that the difficulty cannot be in the weight of the tax for in itself it is a trifle and far from being adequate to our quota of the expence of the war The quitrents of one penny sterling per acre on only one half the state come to upwards of fifty thousand pounds which is almost as much as all the taxes of the present year and as those quitrents made no part of the taxes then paid and are now discontinued the quantity of money drawn for public service this year exclusive of the militia fines which I shall take notice of in the process of this work is less than what was paid and payable in any year preceding the revolution and since the last war  what I mean is that the quitrents and taxes taken together came to a larger sum then than the present taxes without the quitrents do now  My intention by these arguments and calculations is to place the difficulty to the right cause and shew that it does not proceed from the weight or worth of the tax but from the scarcity of the medium in which it is paid and to illustrate this point still farther I shall now shew that if the tax of twenty millions of dollars was of four times the real value it now is or nearly so which would be about two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling and would be our full quota that this sum would have been raised with more ease and less felt than the present sum of only sixty four thousand two hundred and eighty pounds  The convenience or inconvenience of paying a tax in money arises from the quantity of money that can be spared out of trade  When the emissions stopt the continent was left in possession of two hundred millions of dollars perhaps as equally dispersed as it was possible for trade to do it And as no more was to be issued the rise or fall of prices could neither increase nor diminish the quantity It therefore remained the same through all the fluctuations of trade and exchange  Now had the exchange stood at twenty for one which was the rate Congress calculated upon when they quoted the states the latter end of last year trade would have been carried on for nearly four times less money than it is now and consequently the twenty millions would have been spared with much greater ease and when collected would have been of almost four times the value they now are And on the other hand was the depreciation to be ninety or one hundred for one the quantity required for trade would be more than at sixty or seventy for one and though the value of them would be less the difficulty of sparing the money out of trade would be greater And on these facts and arguments I rest the matter to prove that it is not the want of property but the scarcity of the medium by which the proportion of property for taxation is to be measured out that makes the embarrassment we lie under There is not money enough and what is equally as true the people will not let there be money enough  While I am on the subject of the currency I shall offer one remark which will appear true to every body and can be accounted for by nobody which is that the better the times were the worse the money grew and the worse the times were the better the money stood It never depreciated by any advantage obtained by the enemy The troubles  of seventysix and the loss of Philadelphia in seventyseven made no sensible impression on it and every one knows that the surrender of Charlestown did not produce the least alteration in the rate of exchange which for long before and for more than three months after stood at sixty for one It seems as if the certainty of its being our own made us careless of its value and that the most distant thoughts of losing it made us hug it the closer like something we were loth to part with or that we depreciate it for our pastime which when called to seriousness by the enemy we leave off to renew again at our leisure In short our good luck seems to break us andour bad make us whole  Passing on from this digression I shall now endeavour to bring into one view the several parts I have already stated and form thereon some propositions and conclude  I have placed before the reader the average tax per head paid by the people in England which is forty shillings sterling  And I have shewn the rate on an average per head which will defray all the expence of the war to us and support the several governments without running the country into debt which is thirteen shillings and four pence  I have shewn what the peace establishment may be conducted for viz an eighth part of what it would be if under the government of Britain  And I have likewise shewn what the average per head of the present taxes are namely three shillings and five pence sterling or ⅖ per month and that their whole yearly value in sterling is only sixty four thousand two hundred and eighty pounds Whereas our quota to keep the payments equal with the expences is two hundred and fifty thousand pounds Consequently there is a deficiency of one hundred and eightyfive thousand seven hundred and twenty pounds and the same proportion of defect according to the several quotas happens in every other state And this defect is the cause why the army has been so indifferently fed cloathed and paid It is the cause likewise of the nerveless state of the campaign and the insecurity of the country Now if a tax equal to thirteen and four pence per head will remove all these difficuties make people secure in their homes leave them to follow the business of their stores and farms unmolested and not only keep out but drive out the enemy from the country and if the neglect of raising this sum will let them in and produce the evils which might be preventedon which side I ask does the wisdom interest and policy lie Or rather would it not be an insult to reason to put the question The sum when proportioned out according to the several abilities of the people can  hurt no one but an inroad from the enemy ruins hundreds of families  Look at the destruction done in this city The many houses totally destroyed and others damaged the waste of fences in the country round it besides the plunder of furniture forage and provision I do not suppose that half a million sterling would reinstate the sufferers and does this I ask bear any proportion to the expence that would make us secure The damage in an average is at least ten pounds sterling per head which is as much as thirteen shillings and four pence per head comes to for fifteen years The same has happened on the frontiers and in the Jerseys New York and other places where the enemy has beenCarolina and Georgia are likewise suffering the same fate  That the people generally do not understand the insufficiency of the taxes to carry on the war is evident not only from common observation but from the construction of several petitions which were presented to the assembly of this state against the recommendation of Congress of the th of March last for taking up and funding the present currency at forty for one and issuing new money in its stead The prayer of the petition was  That the currency might be appreciated by taxes  meaning the present taxes  and that part of the taxes be applied to the support of the army if the army could not be  otherwise supported  Now it could not have been possible for such a petition to have been presented had the petitioners known that so far from  part  of the taxes being sufficient for the support of the army the  whole  of them falls three fourihs short of the year's expences  Before I proceed to propose methods by which a sufficiency of money may be raised I shall take a short view of the general state of the country  Notwithstanding the weight of the war the ravages of the enemy and the obstructions she has thrown in the way of trade and commerce so soon does a young country outgrow misfortune that America has already surmounted many that once heavily oppressed her For the first year or two of the war we were shut up within our ports scarce venturing to look towards the ocean Now our rivers are beautified with large and valuable vessels our stores filled with merchandize and the produce of the country has a ready market and an advantageous price Gold and silver that for a while seemed to have retreated again within the bowels of the earth is once more risen into circulation and every day adds new strength to trade commerce and agriculture In a pamphlet written by Sir John Dalrymple and dispersed in America in the year he asserted that  two twenty gun ships nay  says he  tenders of those ships stationed between Albemarle sound and Chesapeak bay would  shut up the trade of America for    miles  How little did Sir John Dalrymple know of the abilities of America  While under the government of Britain the trade of this country was loaded with restrictions It was only a few foreign ports we were allowed to sail to Now it is otherwise and allowing that the quantity of trade is but half what it was before the war the case must shew the vast advantage of an open trade because the present quantity under her restrictions could not support itself from which I infer that if half the quantity without the restrictions can bear itself up nearly if not quite as well as the whole when subject to them how prosperous must the condition of America be when the whole shall return open with all the world By trade I do not mean the employment of a merchant only but the whole interest and business of the country taken collectively  It is not so much my intention by this publicacation to propose particular plans for raising money as it is to shew the necessity and the advantages to be derived from it My principle design is to form the disposition of the people to such measures which I am fully persuaded is their interest and duty to adopt and which needs no other force to accomplish them than the force of being felt But as every hint may be useful I shall throw out  a sketch and leave others to make such improvements upon it as to them may appear reasonable  The annual sum wanted is two millions and the average rate in which it falls is thirteen shillings and four pence per head  Suppose then that we raise half the sum and sixty thousand pounds over The average rate thereof will be seven shillings per head  In this case we shall have half the supply we want and an annual fund of sixty thousand pounds whereon to borrow the other million because sixty thousand pounds is the interest of a million at six per cent and if at the end of another year we should be obliged by the continuance of the war to borrow another million the taxes will be increased to seven shillings and sixpence and thus for every million borrowed and an additional tax equal to sixpence per head must be levied  The sum then to be raised next year will be one million and sixty thousand pounds one half of which I would propose should be raised by duties on imported goods and prize goods and the other half by a tax on landed property and houses or such other means as each state may devise  But as the duties on imports and prize goods must be the same in all the states therefore the rate per cent or what other form the duty shall be laid must be ascertained and regulated by Congress and ingrafted in that form into the law of each state and the monies arising therefrom carried into the  treasury of each state The duties to be paid in gold or silver  There are many reasons why a duty on imports is the most convenient duty or tax that can be collected one of which is because the whole is payable in a few places in a country and it likewise operates with the greatest ease and equality because as every one pays in proportion to what he consumes so people in general consume in proportion to what they can afford and therefore the tax is regulated by the abilities which every man supposes himself to have or in other words every man becomes his own assessor and pays by a little at a time when it suits him to buy Besides it is a tax which people may pay or let alone by not consuming the articles and though the alternative may have no influence on their conduct the power of choosing is an agreeable thing to the mind For my own part it would be a satisfaction to me was there a duty on all sorts of liquors during the war as in my idea of things it would be an addition to the pleasure of society to know that when the health of the army goes round a few drops from every glass become theirs How often have I heard an emphatical wish almost accompanied with a tear "  Oh that our poor fellows in the field had some of this  " Why then need we suffer under  a fruitless sympathy when there is a way to enjoy both the wish and the entertainment at once  But the great national policy of putting a duty upon imports is that it either keeps the foreign trade in our own hands or draws something for the defence of the country from every foreigner who participates it with us  Thus much for the first half of the taxes and as each state will best devise means to raise the other half I shall confine my remarks to the resources of this state  The quota then of this state of one million and and sixty thousand pounds will be one hundred and thirty three thousand two hundred and fifty pounds the half of which is sixty six thousand six hundred and twenty five pounds and supposing one fourth part of Pennsylvania inhabited then a tax of one bushel of wheat on every twenty acres of land one with another would produce the sum and all the present taxes to cease Whereas the tythes of the bishops and clergy in England exclusive of the taxes are upwards of half a bushel of wheat on  every single  acre of land good and bad throughout the nation  In the former part of this paper I mentioned the militia fines but reserved speaking to the matter which I shall now do The ground I shall put it upon is that two millions sterling a year will  support a sufficient army and all the expences of war and government without having recourse to the inconvenient method of continually calling men from their employments which of all others is the most expensive and the least substantial I consider the revenues created by taxes as the first and principal thing and fines only as secondary and accidental things It was not the intention of the militia law to apply the miltia fines to any thing else but the support of the militia neither do they produce any revenue to the state yet these fines amount to more than all the taxes for taking the musterroll to be sixty thousand men the fine on forty thousand who may not attend will be sixty thousand pounds sterling and those who muster will give up a portion of time equal to half that sum and if the the eight classes should be called within the year and one third turn out the fine on the remaining forty thousand would amount to seventy two millions of dollars besides the fifteen shillings on every hundred pounds property and the charge of seven and a half per cent for collecting in certain instances which on the whole would be upwards of two hundred and fifty thousand pounds sterling  Now if those very fines disable the country from raising a sufficient revenue without producing an equivalent advantage would it not be to the case and interest of all parties to encrease the revenue  in the manner I have proposed or any better if a better can be devised and cease the operation of the fines I would still keep the militia as an organized body of men and should there be a real necessity to call them forth pay them out of the proper revenues of the state and encrease the taxes a third or fourth per cent on those who do not attend My limits will not allow me to go farther into this matter which I shall therefore close with this remark that fines are of all modes of revenue the most unsuited to the mind of a free country When a man pays a tax he knows the public necessity requires it and therefore feels a pride in discharging his duty but a fine seems an atonement for neglect of duty and of consequence is paid with discredit and frequently levied with with severity  I have now only one subject more to speak to with which I shall conclude which is the resolve of Congress of the th of March last for taking up and funding the present currency at forty for one and issuing new money in its stead  Every one knows that I am not the flatterer of Congress but in this instance  they are right  and if that measure is supported the currency will acquire a value which without it it will not But this is not all It will give relief to the finances until such time as they can be properly arranged and save the  country from being immediately double taxed under the present mode In short support that measure and it will support you  I have now waded through a tedious course of difficult business and over an untrodden path The subject on every point it could be viewed was entangled with perplexities and enveloped in obsurity yet such are the resources of America that she wants nothing but system to insure success  COMMON SENSE  Philadelphia  March  THE CRISIS  No XII  No The publishers have not been able to procure after the most diligent search and enquiry in the principal cities and towns c in America    On the present State of News  SINCE the arrival of two if not three packets in quick succession at New York from England a variety of unconnected  news  has circulated through the country and afforded as great a variety of speculation  That something is the matter in the cabinet and councils of our enemies on the other side of the water is certainthat they have run their length of madness and are under the necessity of changing their measures may easily be seen into but to what this change of measure may amount or how far it may correspond with our interest happiness and duty is yet uncertain and from what we have hitherto  experienced we have too much reason to suspect them in every thing  I do not address this publication so much to the people of America as to the British ministry whoever they may be for if it is their intention to promote any kind of negociation it is proper they should know before hand that the United States have as much honour as bravery that they are no more to be seduced from their alliance than their allegiance that their line of politics is formed and not dependant like that of their enemy on chance and accident  On our part in order to know at any time what the British government will do we have only to find out what they ought  not  to do and this last will be their conduct For ever changing and for ever wrong too distant from America to improve circumstances and too unwise to foresee them scheming without principle and executing without probability their whole line of management has hitherto been blunder and baseness Every campaign has added to their loss and every year to their disgrace till unable to go on and ashamed to go back their politics have come to a halt and all their fine prospects to the halter  Could our affections forgive or humanity forget the wounds of an infant countrywe might under the influence of a momentary oblivion stand  still and laugh But they are engraven where no amusement can conceal them and of a kind for which there is no recompence Can ye restore to us the beloved dead Can ye say to the grave give up the murdered Can ye obliterate from our memories those who are no more Think not then to tamper with our feelings by insidious contrivance nor suffocate our humanity by seducing us to dishonour  In March I published part of the Crisis No IX in the newspapers but did not conclude it in the following papers and the remainder has lain by me till the present day  There appeared about that time some disposition in the British cabinet to cease the further prosecution of the war and as I had formed my opinion that whenever such a design should take place it would be accompanied with a dishonourable proposition to America respecting France I had suppressed the remainder of that number not to expose the baseness of any such proposition But the arrival of the next news from England declared her determination to go on with the war and consequently as the political object I had then in view was not become a subject it is unnecessary in me to bring it forward which is the reason it was never published  The matter which I allude to in the unpublished part I shall now make a quotation of and apply it  as the more enlarged state of things at this day shall make convenient or necessary  It was as follows  "By the speeches which have appeared from the British Parliament it is easy to perceive to what impolitic and imprudent excesses their passions and prejudices have in every instance carried them during the present war Provoked at the upright and honourable treaty between America and France they imagined nothing more was necessary to be done to prevent its final ratification than to promise through the agency of their commissioners Carlisle Eden and Johnston a repeal of their once offensive acts of parliament The vanity of the conceit was as unpardonable as the experiment was impolitic And so convinced am I of their wrong ideas of America that I shall not wonder if in their last stage of political phrenzy they propose to her to break her alliance with France and enter into one with them Such a proposition should it ever be made and it has already been more than once hinted in parliament would discover such a disposition to perfidiousness and such disregard of honour and morals as would add the finishing vice to national corruptionI do not mention this to put America on the watch but to put England on her guard that she do not in the looseness of her  heart envelope in disgrace every fragment of reputation"Thus far the quotation  By the complexion of some part of the news which has transpired through the New York papers it seems probable that this insidious aera in the British politics is beginning to make its appearance I wish it may not for that which is a disgrace to human nature throws something of a shade over all the human character and the individual feels his share of the wound that is given to the whole  The policy of Britain has ever been to divide America in some way or other In the beginning of the dispute she practised every art to prevent or destroy the union of the states well knowing that could she once get them to stand singly she could conquer them unconditionally Failing in this project in America she renewed it in Europe and after the alliance had taken place she made secret offers to France to induce her to give up America and what is still more extraordinary she at the same time made propositions to doctor Franklin then in Paris the very court to which she was secretly applying to draw off America from France But this is not all  On the th of September the British court through their secretary lord Weymouth made application to the Marquis D'Almadovar the  Spanish Ambassador at London to "ask the MEDIATION" for these were the words of the court of Spain for the purpose of negociation a peace with France leaving America as I shall hereafter shew out of the question Spain readily offered her Mediation and likewise the city of Madrid as the place of conference but withal proposed that the united States of America should be invited to the treaty and considered as independent during the time the business was negociating But this was not the view of England She wanted to draw France from the war that she might uninterruptedly pour out all her force and fury upon America and being disappointed in this plan as well through the open and generous conduct of Spain as the determination of France she refused the mediation she had solicited  I shall now give some extracts from the justifying memorial of the Spanish court in which she has set the conduct and character of Britain with respect to America in a clear and striking point of light  The memorial speaking of the refusal of the British court to meet in conference with commissioners from the United States who were to be considered as independent during the time of the conference says  "It is a thing very extraordinary and even ridicuculous that the court of London who treats the colonies as independent not only in acting but of right during the war should have a repugnance to treat them as such only in acting during a truce of suspension of hostilities The convention of Saratoga the reputing general Burgoyne as a lawful prisoner in order to suspend his trial the exchange and liberating other prisoners made from the colonies they having named Commissioners to go and supplicate the Americans at their own doors request peace of them and treat with them and the Congress and finally by a thousand other acts of this sort authorised by the court of London which have been and are true signs of the acknowledgement of of their independence  "In aggravation to all the foregoing at the same time the British cabinet answered the king of Spain in the terms already mentioned they were insinuating themselves at the court of France by means of secret emissaries and making very great offers to her to abandon the colonies and make peace with England But there is yet more for at this same time the English ministry were treating by means of another certain emissary with doctor Franklin minister plenipotentiary from the colonies residing at Paris to whom they made various proposals  to disunite them from France and accommodate matters with England"  "From what has been observed it evidently follows that the whole of the British politics was to disunite the two courts of Paris and Madrid by means of the suggestions and offers she separately made to them and also to separate the colonies from their treaties and engagements entered into with France and induce them to arm against the house of Bourbon or MORE PROBABLY TO OPPRESS THEM WHEN THEY FOUND FROM BREAKING THEIR ENGAGEMENTS THEY STOOD ALONE AND WITHOUT PROTECTORS"  "This therefore is the net they laid for the American states that is to say to tempt them with flattering and very magnificent promises to come to an accommodation with them exclusive of any intervention of Spain or France that the British ministry might always remain the arbiters of the fate of the colonies  "But the Catholic king the king of Spain faithful on the one part to the engagements which bind him to the most Christian king the king of France his nephew just and upright on the other to his own subjects whom he ought to protect and guard against so many insults and finally full of humanity and compassion for the Americans and  other individuals who suffer in the present war he is determined to pursue and prosecute it and to make all the efforts in his power until he can obtain a solid and permanent peace with full and satisfactory securities that it shall be observed"  Thus far the memorial a translation of which into English may be seen in full under the head of STATE PAPERS in the Annual Register for page  The extracts I have here given serve to shew the various endeavours and contrivances of the enemy to draw France from her connection with America and to prevail on her to make a separate peace with England leaving America totally out of the question and at the mercy of a merciless unprincipled enemy The opinion likewise which Spain has formed of the British cabinet character for meanness and perfidiousness is so exactly the opinion of America respecting it that the memorial in this instance contains our own sentiments and language for people however remote who think alike will unavoidably speak alike  Thus we see the insidious use which Britain endeavoured to make of the propositions for peace under the mediation of SpainI shall now proceed to the second proposition under the mediation of the emperor of Germany and the empress of Russia the general outline of which was that a  congress of the several powers at war should meet at Vienna in to settle preliminaries of peace  I could wish myself at liberty to make use of all the information I am possessed of on this subject but as there is a delicacy in the manner I do not conceive it prudent at least at present to make references and quotations in the same manner as I have done with respect to the mediation of Spain who published the whole proceedings herself and therefore what comes from me on this part of the business must rest on my own credit with the public assuring them that when the whole proceedings relative to the proposed congress at Vienna shall appear they shall find my account not only true but studiously moderate  We know that at the time this mediation was on the carpet the expectations of the British king and ministry ran high with respect to the conquest of America The English packet which was taken with the mail on board and carried into l'Orient in France contained letters from lord G Germaine to sir Henry Clinton which expressed in the fullest terms the ministerial idea of a total conquest Copies of those letters were sent to Congress and published in the newspapers of last year Colonel Laurens brought over the originals some of which signed in the hand writing  of the then secretary Germaine are now in my possession  Filled with these high ideas nothing could be more insolent towards America than the language of the British court on the proposed meditation A peace with France and Spain she anxiously solicited but America as before should be left to her mercy neither would she hear any propositions for admitting an agent from the United States into the congress of Vienna  On the other hand France with an open noble and manly determination and the fidelity of a good ally would hear no proposition for a separate peace nor even meet in congress at Vienna without an agent from America and likewise that the independant character of the United States represented by the agent should be fully and unequivocally defined and settled before any conference should be entered on The reasoning of the court of France on the several propositions of the two Imperial courts which relate to us is rather in the style of an American than an ally and she advocated the cause of America as if she had been America herself Thus the second mediation like the first proved ineffectual  But since that time a reverse of fortune has overtaken the British arms and all their high expectations are dashed to the ground The noble exertions  to the southward under general Green the successful operations of the allied armies in the Chesepeake the loss of most of their islands in the WestIndies and Minorca in the Mediterranean the persevering spirit of Spain against Gibraltar the expected capture of Jamaica the failure of making a separate peace with Holland and the expence of one hundred millions sterling by which all these fine losses were obtained have read them a loud lesson of disgraceful misfortune and necessity has called on them to change their ground in this situation of confusion and despair their present councils have no fixed character It is now the hurricane months of British politics Every day seems to have a storm of its own and they are scudding under the bare poles of hope Beaten but not humble condemned but not penitent they act like men trembling at fate and catching at a strawFrom this convulsion in the intrails of their politics it is more than probable that the mountain groaning in labor will bring forth a mouse as to its size and a monster in its make They will try on America the same insidious arts they tried on France and Spain  We sometimes experience sensations to which language is not equal The conception is too bulky to be born alive and in the torture of thinking we stand dumb Our feelings imprisoned by their  magnitude find no way outand in the struggle of expression every finger tries to be a tongue The machinery of the body seems too little for the mind and we look about for helps to shew our thoughts bySuch must be the sensation of America whenever Britain teeming with corruption shall propose to her to sacrifice her faith  But exclusive of the wickedness there is a personal offence contained in every such attempt It is calling us villains for no man asks another to act the villain unless he believes him inclined to be one No man attempts to seduce a truly honest woman It is the supposed looseness of her mind that starts the thoughts of seduction and he who offers it calls her a prostitute Our pride is always hurt by the same propositions which offend our principles for when we are shocked at the crime we are wounded by the suspicion of our compliance  Could I convey a thought that might serve to regulate the public mind I would not make the interest of the alliance the basis of defending it All the world are moved by interest and it affords them nothing to boast of But I would go a step higher and defend it on the ground of honour and principle That our public affairs have flourished under the alliancethat it was  wisely made and has been nobly executedthat by its assistance we are enabled to preserve our country from conquest and expel those who sought our destructionthat it is our true interest to maintain it unimpaired and that while we do so no enemy can conquer usare matters which experience has taught us and the common good of ourselves abstracted from principles of faith and honor would lead us to maintain the connection  But over and above the mere letter of the alliance we have been nobly and generously treated and have had the same respect and attention paid us as if we had been an old established country To oblige and be obliged is fair work among mankind and we want an opportunity of shewing to the world that we are a people sensible of kindness and worthy of confidence Character is to us in our present circumstances of more importance than interest We are a young nation just stepping upon the stage of public life and the eye of the world is upon us to see how we act We have an enemy that is watching to destroy our reputation and who will go any length to gain some evidence against us that may serve to render our conduct suspected and our character odious because could she accomplish this wicked as it  is the world would withdraw from us as from a people not to be trusted and our task would then become difficult  There is nothing sets the character of a nation in a higher or lower light with others than the faithfully sulfilling or perfidiously breaking of treaties They are things not to be tampered with and should Britain which seems very probable propose to seduce America into such an act of baseness it would merit from her some mark of unusual detestation It is one of those extraordinary instances in which we ought not to be contented with the bare negative of congress because it is an affront on the multitude as well as on the government It goes on the supposition that the public are not honest men and that they may be managed by contrivance though they cannot be conquered by arms But let the world and Britain know that we are neither to be bought nor sold That our mind is great and fixt our prospect clear and that we will support our character as firmly as our independence  But I will go still farther general Conway who made the motion in the British parliament for discontinuing  offensive  war in America is a gentleman of an amiable character We have no personal quarrel with him But he feels not as we feel he is not in our situation and that alone with out any other explanation is enough  The British parliament supposes they have many friends in America and that when all chance of conquest is over they will be able to draw her from her alliance with France Now if I have any conception of the human heart they will fail in this more than in any thing they have yet tried  This part of the business is not a question of policy only but of honour and honesty and the proposition will have in it something so visibly low and base that their partizans if they have any will be ashamed of it Men are often hurt by a mean action who are not started at a wicked one and this will be such a confession of their inability such a declaration of servile thinking that the scandal of it will ruin all their hopes  In short we have nothing to do but to go on with vigour and determination The enemy is yet in our country They hold Newyork Charleston and Savannah and the very being in those places is an offence and a part of offensive war and until they can be driven from or captured in them it would be folly in us to listen to an idle tale I take it for granted that the British ministry are sinking under the impossibility of carrying on the war Let them come to a fair and open peace with France Spain Holland and America in the manner she ought to do but until then we can have nothing to say to them  Phiadelphia  May  COMMON SENSE  To Sir Guy Carlton  IT is the nature of compassion to associate with misfortune and I address this to you in behalf even of an enemy a captain in the British service now on his way to the head quarters of the American army and unfortunately doomed to death for a crime not his ownA sentence so extraordinary an execution so repugnant to every human sensation ought never to be told without the circumstances which produced it and as the destined victim is yet in existence and in your hands rest his life or death I shall briefly state the case and the melancholy consequence  Captain Huddy of the Jersey militia was attacked in a small fort on Tom's river by a party of refugees in the British pay and service was made prisoner together with his company carried to NewYork and lodged in the provost of that city about three weeks after which he was taken out of the Provost down to the waterside put into a boat and brought again upon the Jersey shore and there contrary to the practice of all nations but savages was hung up on a tree and left hanging until found by our people who took him down and buried him  The inhabitants of that part of the country where the murder was committed sent a deputation to General Washington with a full and certified statement of the fact Struck as every human breast must be with such brutish outrage and determined both to punish and prevent it for the future the general represented the case to General Clinton who then commanded and demanded that the refugee officer who ordered and attended the execution and whose name is Lippincut should be delivered up as a murderer and in case of refusal that the person of some British officer should suffer in his stead The demand though not refused has not been complied with and the melancholy lot not by selection but by casting lots has fallen upon Captain Asgill of the guards who as I have already mentioned is on his way from Lancaster to camp a martyr to the general wickedness of the cause he engaged in and the ingratitude of those he has served  The first reflection that arises on this black business is what sort of men must Englishmen be and what sort of order and discipline do they preserve in their army when in the immediate place of their head quarters and under the eye and nose of their commander in chief a prisoner can be taken at pleasure from his confinement and his death made a matter of sport  The history of the most savage Indians does not produce instances exactly of this kind They at least have a formality in their punishments With them it is the horridness of revenge but with your army it is the still greater crime the horridness of diversion  The British generals who have succeeded each other from the time of General Gage to yourself have all affected to speak in language they have no right to In their proclamations their addresses their letters to General Washington and their supplications to Congress for they deserve no other name they talk of British honour British generosity and British clemency as if those things were matters of fact whereas we whose eyes are open who speak the same language with yourselves many of whom were born on the same spot with you and who can no more be mistaken in your words than in your actions can declare to all the world that so far as our knowledge goes there is not a more detestable character nor a meaner or more barbarous enemy than the present British one With us you have forfeited all pretentions of reputation and it is only holding you like a wild beast afraid of your keepers that you can be made manageableBut to return to the point in question  Though I can think no man innocent who has lent his hand to destroy the country which he did not plant and to ruin those he could not enslave yet abstracted from all ideas of right or wrong on the original question Captain Asgyli in the present case is not the guilty man The villain and the victim are here separated characters You hold the one and we the other You disown or affect to disown and reprobate the conduct of Lippencut yet you give him sanctuary and by so doing you as effectually become the executioner of Asgill as if you put the rope round his neck and dismissed him from the world Whatever your feelings on this extraordinary occasion may be are best known to yourself Within the grave of our own mind lies buried the fate of Asgill He becomes the corpse of your will or the survivor of your justice Deliver up the one and you save the other withhold the one and the other dies by your choice  On our part the case is exceeding plain AN OFFICER HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM HIS CONFINEMENT AND MURDERED AND THE MURDERER IS WITHIN YOUR LINES Your army have been guilty of a thousand instances of equal cruelty but they have been rendered equivocal and sheltered from personal detection Here the crime is fixt and is one of those extraordinary cases which can neither  be denied nor palliated and to which the custom os war does not apply for it never could be supposed that such a brutal outrage would ever be committed It is an original in the history of civilized barbarians and is truly British  On your part you are accountable to us for the personal safety of the prisoners within your walls Here can be no mistake they can neither be spies nor suspected as such your security is not endangered nor your operations subjected to miscarriage by men immured within a dungeon They differ in every cirumstance from men in the field and leave no pretence for severity of punishment But if to the dismal condition of captivity with you must be added the constant apprehensions of death if to be imprisoned is so nearly to be entombed and if after all the murderers are to be protected and thereby the crime encouraged wherein do you differ from Indians either in conduct or character  We can have no idea of your honour or your justice in any future transaction of what nature it may be while you shelter within your lines an outrageous murderer and sacrifice in his stead an officer of your own If you have no regard to us at least spare the blood which it is your duty to save Whether the puishment will be greater on him whom in this case innocently dies or on him whom sad necessity forces to retaliate is in the  nicety of sensation an undecided Question It rests with you to prevent the sufferings of both You have nothing to do but to give up the murderer and the matter ends  But to protect him be he who he may is to patronize his crime and to trifle it off by frivolous and and unmeaning enquiries is to promote it There is no declaration you can make no promise you can give that will obtain credit It is the man and not the apology that is demanded  You see yourself pressed on all sides to spare the life of your own officer for die he will if you withhold justice The murder of captain Huddy is an offence not to be borne with and there is no security we can have that such actions or similar ones shall not be repeated but by making the punishment fall upon yourselves To destroy the last security of captivity and to take the unarmed the unresisting prisoner to private and sportive execution is carrying barbarity too high for silence The evil must be put an end to and the choice of persons rests with you But if your attachment to the guilty is stronger than to the innocent you invent a crime that must destroy your character and if the cause of your King needs to be supported for ever cease sir to torture our remembrance with the wretched phrases of British honour British generosity and British clemency  From this melancholy circumstance learn sir a lesson of morality The refugees are men whom your predecessors have instructed in wickedness the better to fit them to their master's purpose To make them useful they have made them vile and the consequence of their tortured villainy is now descending on the heads of their encouragers They have been trained like hounds to the scent of blood and cherished in every species of dissolute barbarity Their ideas of right and wrong are worn away in the constant habitude of repeated infamy till like men practised in executions they feel not the value of another's life  The task before you though painful is not difficult give up the murderer and save your officer as the first outset of a necessary reformation  COMMON SENSE  Pennsylvania  May  THE CRISIS  No XIV  The same diligent search and enquiry was made for the th as for the th numberwithout success    "THE times that tried mens souls"  "These are the times that try mens souls" Crisis No published December  are over and the greatest and completest revolution the world ever knew gloriously and happily accomplished  But to pass from the extremes of danger to safety from the tumult of war to the tranquility of peace though sweet in contemplation requires a gradual composure of the senses to receive it Even calmness has the power of stunning when it opens too instantly upon us The long and raging hurricane that should cease in a moment would leave us in a state rather of wonder than enjoyment and some moments of recollection must pass before we could be capable of tasting the full felicity of repose There are but  few instances in which the mind is fitted for sudden transitions It takes in its pleasures by reflection and comparison and those must have time to act before the relish for new scenes is complete  In the present casethe mighty magnitude of the objectthe various uncertainties of fate it has undergonethe numerous and complicated dangers we have suffered or escapedthe eminence we now stand on and the vast prospect before us must all conspire to impress us with contemplation  To see it in our power to make a world happy to teach mankind the art of being soto exhibit on the theatre of the universe a character hitherto unknownand to have as it were a new creation entrusted to our hands are honors that command reflection and can neither be too highly estimated nor too gratefully received  In this pause then of recollectionwhile the storm is ceasing and the long agitated mind vibrating to a rest let us look back on the scenes we have passed and learn from experience what is yet to be done  Never I say had a country so many openings to happiness as this Her setting out into life like the rising of a fair morning was unclouded and promising Her cause was good Her principals  just and liberal Her temper serene and firm Her conduct regulated by the nicest steps and every thing about her wore the mark of honour  It is not every country perhaps there is not another in the world that can boast so fair an origin Even the first settlement of America corresponds with the character of the revolution Rome once the proud mistress of the universe was originally a band of ruffians Plunder and rapine made her rich and her oppression of millions made her great But America needs never be ashamed to tell her birth nor relate the stages by which she rose to empire  The remembrance then of what is past if it operates rightly must inspire her with the most laudable of all ambition that of adding to the fair fame she began with The world has seen her great in adversity Struggling without a thought of yielding beneath accumulated difficulties Bravely nay proudly encountering distress and rising in resolution as the storm encreased All this is justly due to her for her fortitude has merited the character Let then the world see that she can bear prosperity and that her honest virtue in time of peace is equal to the bravest virtue in time of war  She is now descending to the scenes of quiet and domestic life Not beneath the cypress shade of  disappointment but to enjoy in her own land and under her own vine the sweet of her labors and the reward of her toil In this situation may she never forget that a fair national reputation is of as much importance as independence That it possesses a charm which wins upon the world and makes even enemies civil That it gives a dignity which is often superior to power and commands a reverence where pomp and splendor fail  It would be a circumstance ever to be lamented and never to be forgotten were a single blot from any cause whatever suffered to fall on a revolution which to the end of time must be an honor to the age that accomplished it and which has contributed more to enlighten the world and diffuse a spirit of freedom and liberality among mankind than any human event if this may be called one that ever preceded it  It is not among the least of the calamities of a long continued war that it unhinges the mind from those nice sensations which at other times appear so amiable The continual spectacle of woe blunts the finer feelings and the necessity of bearing with the sight renders it familiar In like manner are many of the moral obligations of society weakened till the custom of acting by necessity becomes an apology where it is truly a crime Yet let but a nation conceive rightly of its character and it will  be chastly just in protecting it None ever began with a fairer than America and none can be under a greater obligation to preserve it  The debt which America has contracted compared with the cause she has gained and the advantages to flow from it ought scarcely to be mentioned She has it in her choice to do and to live as happily as she pleases The world is in her hands She has no foreign power to monopolize her commerce perplex her legislation or controul her prosperity The struggle is over which must one day have happened and perhaps never could have happended at a better time  That the revolution began at the exact period of time best fitted to the purpose is sufficiently proved by the eventBut the great hinge on which the whole machine turned is the UNION OF THE STATES and this union was naturally produced by the inability of any one state to support itself against any foreign enemy without the assistance of the rest  Had the states severally been less able than they were when the war began their united strength would not have been equal to the undertaking and they must in all human probability have failedAnd on the other hand had they severally been more able they might not have seen or what is more might not have felt the necessity of uniting and either by attempting to stand alone or in small confederacies would have been separately conquered  Now as we cannot see a time and many years must pass away before it can arrive when the strength of any one state or several united can be equal to the whole of the present United States and as we have seen the extreme difficulty of collectively prosecuting the war to a successful issue and preserving our national importance in the world therefore from the experience we have had and the knowledge we have gained we must unless we make a waste of wisdom be strongly impressed with the advantage as well as the necessity of strengthening that happy union which has been our salvation and without which we should have been a ruined people  While I was writing this note I cast my eye on the pamphlet COMMON SENSE from which I shall make an extract as it applies exactly to the case It is as follows  "I have never met with a man either in England or America who hath not confessed his opinion that a separation between the countries would take place one time or other And there is no instance in which we have shewn less judgment than in endeavouring to describe what we call the ripeness or fitness of the continent for independence  "As all men allow the measure and differ only in their opinion of the time let us in order to remove mistakes take a general survey of things and endeavour if possible to find out the VERY TIME But we need not go far the enquiry ceases at once for THE TIME HATH FOUND US The general concurrence the glorious union of all things prove the fact  "It is not in numbers but in a union that our great strength lies The continent is just arrived at that pitch of strength in which no single colony is able to support itself and the whole when united can accomplish the matter and either more or less than this might be fatal in its effects"  And  instead of a domineering master she has gained an  ally  whose exemplary greatness and universal liberality have extorted a confession even from her enemies  With the blessings of peace independence and an universal commerce the states individually and collectively will have leisure and opportunity to regulate and establish their domestic concerns and to put it beyond the power of calumny to throw the least reflection on their honor Character is much easier kept than recovered and that man if any such there be who from any sinister views or littleness of soul lends unseen his hand to injure it contrives a wound it will never be in his power to heal  As we have established an inheritance for posterity let that inheritance descend with every mark of an honourable conveyance The little it will cost compared with the worth of the states the greatness of the object and the value of national character will be a profitable exchange  But that which must more forcibly strike a thoughtful penetrating mind and which includes and renders easy all inferior concerns is the  UNION OF THE STATES On this our great national character depends It is this which must give▪ us importance abroad and security at home It is through this only that we are or can be nationally known in the world It is the flag of the United States which renders our ships and commerce safe on the seas or in a foreign port Our Mediterranean passes must be obtained under the same stile All our treaties whether of alliance peace or commerce are formed under the sovereignty of the United States and Europe knows us by no other name or title  The division of the empire into states is for our own convenience but abroad this distinction ceases The affairs of each state are local They can go no farther than to itself And were the whole worth of even the richest of them expended in revenue it would not be sufficient to support sovereignty against a foreign attack In short we have no other national sovereignty than as United States It would even be fatal for us if we hadtoo expensive to be maintained and impossible to be supported Individuals or individual states may call themselves what they please but the world and especially the world of enemies is not to be held in awe by the whistling of a name Sovereignty must have  power to protect all the parts that compose and constitute it and as UNITED STATES we are equal to the importance of the title but otherwise we are not Our union well and wisely regulated and cemented is the cheapest way of being great the easiest way of being powerful and the happiest invention in government which the circumstances of America can admit ofBecause it collects from each state that which by being inadequate can be of no use to it and forms an aggregate that serves for all  The states of Holland are an unfortunate instance of the effects of individual sovereignty Their disjointed condition exposes them to numerous intrigues losses calamities and enemies and the almost impossibility of bringing their measures to a decision and that decision into execution is to them and would be to us a source of endless misfortune  It is with confederated states as with individuals in society something must be yielded up to make the whole secure In this view of things we gain by what we give and draw an annual interest greater than the capitalI ever feel myself hurt when I hear the union that great palladium of our liberty and safety the least irreverently spoken of It is the most sacred thing in the constitution of America and that which every man should be  most proud and tender of Our citizenship in the United states is our national character Our citizenship in any particular state is only our local distinction By the latter we are known at home by the former to the world Our great title is AMERICANSour inferior one varies with the place  So far as my endeavours could go they have all been directed to conciliate the affections unite the interests and draw and keep the mind of the country together and the better to assist in this foundation work of the revolution I have avoided all places of profit or office either in the state I live in or in the United States kept myself at a distance from all parties and party connections and even disregarded all private and inferior concerns and when we take into view the great work we have gone through and feel as we ought to feel the just importance of it we shall then see that the little wranglings and indecent contentions of personal party are as dishonourable to our characters as they are injurious to our repose  It was the cause of America that made me an author The force with which it struck my mind and the dangerous condition of the country appeared to me in by courting an impossible and unnatural reconciliation with those who were determined to reduce her instead of striking  out into the only line that could cement and save her A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE made it impossible for me feeling as I did to be silent and if in the course of more than seven years I have rendered her any service I have likewise added something to the reputation of literature by freely and disinterestedly employing it in the great cause of mankind and shewing there may be genius without prostitution  Independence always appeared to me practicable and probable provided the sentiment of the country could be formed and held to the object and there is no instance in the world where a people so extended and wedded to former habits of thinking and under such a variety of circumstances were so instantly and ineffectually pervaded by a turn in politics as in the case of independence and who supported their opinon undiminished through such a succession of good and illfortune till they crowned it with success  But as the scenes of war are closed and every man preparing for home and happier times I therefore take my leave of the subject I have most sincerely followed it from beginning to end and through all its turns and windings and whatever  country I may hereafter be in I shall always feel an honest pride at the part I have taken and acted and a gratitude to Nature and Providence for putting it in my power to be of some use to mankind  COMMON SENSE
