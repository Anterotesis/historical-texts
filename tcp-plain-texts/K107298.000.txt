 A REPLY TO THE  Grand Question debated  Fully proving That the SOUL of MAN  is  and  must be  IMMORTAL  WHEREIN The Folly and Infidelity of DEISM are exposed and the Belief of the CHRISTIAN SYSTEM proved rationally necessary  By  ONTOLOGOS  Slave to no Sect who takes no private Road  But looks thro' Nature up to Nature's God  POPE  LONDON  Printed for F STAMPER and E DOWNHAM in  Pope'sHeadAlley Cornhill    Price  s    d    TO THE Right Reverend FATHER in GOD  THOMAS  Lord Archbishop of  Ganterbury  Rev SIR  AS I took the Liberty to lay before your Grace the Design of my first Essay I presume it is owing to the Confidence your Lordship was pleased to place in the Veracity  of that Design that so glaring and seemingly impious Attempt against the Cause of Virtue and Religion was permitted to have its Effect On this Account my Lord I cannot resist the Temptation I feel of presenting this Piece to your Grace as a Confirmation of the Reality of those Intentions on which I hope your Lordship's Pardon for my Presumption in doing myself this Honour which I am the more excited to my Lord as that Piece has had the Effect design'd infinitely beyond the Author's Expectations For in this Age where Deism and Infidelity are esteem'd fashionable the weakest Arguments in the Support of the  favourite System  will find Believers while the strongest in the Cause of Religion in general or  Christianity in particular shall be derided as partial bigotted and irrational For this Reason my Lord I have confin'd myself both in this Reply and in the former Essay to a Manner of Reasoning peculiar to the Deists having introduc'd not a single Argument in their Favour more than I have heard often advanc'd by that Sett of Men  I could indeed have reason'd more like a Christian and consequently more like a Man of Sense but if these Disquisitions should convince the pretended Rationalist of the Errors of his Reasoning or afford any Believer in the System of Christianity Arguments to refute those who are daily striving to draw Converts to that general and extensive  Manner of Opinion  very  erroneously  called  Freethinking  the Author's End is answered And that such may be the Consequence is the earnest Prayers of  My Lord  With the greatest Submission and Respect Your Grace's most Obedient Humble Servant  The AUTHOR  CONTENTS  SECT I  THE Definition of the Soul as given in

examin'd  SECT VII  Our Relation to the Brute Creation considered  SECT VIII  The Souls of Brutes and Men compared  SECT IX  The Understanding of Men and Brutes considered  SECT X  Of the Probability and Possibility of the Soul's Immortality with a rational Definition of God  A REPLY TO The Grand Question debated  SECT I  The Definition of the Soul as given in our opposite Essay examin'd and proved erroneous  IT may perhaps be expected that this Essay as it is written in Opposition to a foregoing should deny without Distinction every thing that has been before prov'd or asserted but it is esteemed more requisite to the Author's Design to prove the Immortality of the Soul without so much as endeavouring to confute the Arguments made use of to the contrary as the Conclusions drawn from a wrong Representation of such Arguments We shall therefore to avoid long and tedious enquiry allow every Assertion to be  just that doth not stand diametrically opposite to that great and important Truth  the Soul is and must be immortal  To proceed therefore with the same Degree of regularity as our opposite Essay we shall first consider the Definition there given us of the Soul which is the following  st We allow that the Soul is an intellectual Being not at all subject to the Accidents and Properties of  Matter  in general such as Solidity Extension Contraction Expansion or any Quality whereby it is rendered local or in a capacity to take up the least or the most infinite Space  dly That this intellectual Being is acting on only a particular Part of Matter  i e  the Body by certain inexplicable means as utterly unknown to us as the means how the Planets act in the Orbits by wonderful dependencies on their proper Centers of Gravitation all which we can attribute to nothing but the Will of the great Creator from whom they have received such necessary Laws as are stiled the  Laws of Nature  dly That the Soul is nothing but that Power  in  Man or rather acting on the Body of Man that enables him to perceive to reflect and to will  thly That the  Soul  is a  perpetual  or  constant  Power of thinking and that upon its ceasing to be  Active  it must immediately cease to be  It is says our opposite Essay from these stated Principles that a late Philosopher meaning Dr  Watts  draws the Inference of the Soul's being immortal But perhaps it may be found at least I am firmly persuaded that there is no Man but must be conscious on reading the Works of that learned Gentleman it was from a far more sublime Idea of the human Soul that he drew those Conclusions For notwithstanding the above Definition does not contradict the philosophical Idea entertained of the Soul by the best and most rational Philosophers it is nevertheless a very imperfect one and not in reality that of the  Soul  of  Man  For a just Definition must consist of every essential Property belonging to  that  which is defin'd and that this does not is plainly confess'd in  Section the th of our opposite Essay where it is said that  goodness of Heart  and the  Power  of  judging of Truth  as to the fitness and unfitness of things are  essential  to the SoulNow both these Properties are evaded in the Definition under the general Term of Reflection or Reason and tho' that Essay may be supposed to prove that a Soul capable of both Reflection and Reason may be as liable to Mortality as the Brutes which as is fairly enough prov'd are as capable of some kind of Reflection and Reason as some of the lowest of Mankind yet it is no where prov'd that a Soul poffess'd of Goodness of Heart and that innate Power of judging of Truth may be or is subject to Annihilation It is indeed attempted to be prov'd that this Power of judging of Truth is implanted in the Brutes but it will appear by and by the Sagacity of their Actions may be much more easily accounted for without this supposition and as to this innate Goodness of Heart there made necessary to the Production of Virtue notwithstanding it is allowed to be  essential  to the Soul it is not at all brought to stand in the Comparison between the Souls of  Brutes  and  Men  It is impossible then this Comparison can be just unless  every essential Quality Mode and Property exactly answered both in the Souls of Brutes and Men to each other And this Manner of Reasoning however smoothly it might be swallowed by that weakthinking Part of Mankind the Deists is as stupid and ridiculous as it would be to assert that a Horse because he has a Head Legs and other Parts similar to some other Animal must be such an Animal  There is indeed a very great Error in adjudging the Source of Virtue to that Goodness of Heart naturally implanted in the Soul or as  Watts  calls it a Disposition towards Goodness appearing in some Degree in all People For if as is also allow'd by our opposite Essay  that  is the greatest Act of Virtue which is calculated to produce the greatest public Happiness it will be found that Men may have too much as well as too little of this natural Disposition to Goodness or as Mr  Fielding  terms it  Milk of human Kindness  But this will more evidently appear by and by  The above Definition of the Soul must needs be imperfect as there is a Necessity we should have a Source for Virtue in the rational Mind and which is allowed essential to the Soul and expressed by the Term Goodness of Heart And yet this is found insufficient of itself to produce Virtue which is afterwards allowed to be owing also in a great Degree to that innate Knowledge of Truth and that it is from these two Powers operating in Conjunction that arise Actions of VirtueOur opposite Essay in this Point seems plainly to be calculated for the Reasonings of the Deists or certainly it would never have proceeded upon a Definition of the Soul that wanted even the most essential Property belonging to itthe  Source of moral Virtue  And how few Men must there be or otherwise how besotted are they who can think  that  a  just  Definition of the Soul of Man that has neither the Word or the Meaning of the Word CONSCIENCE in it  If I could be persuaded indeed that there was no such sacred Impulse implanted in the Nature of Man to direct his Actions I could easily agree with our opposite Essay  in earnest to favour the Doctrine of the Soul's Mortality But it is on this only I depend for the Confutation of that Opinion It is on  this implanted Power  or in the Language of the sacred Writings this  Law of God written in our Hearts  I am confident I can make appear the true Source of the Universality of that Opinion  that the Soul is immortal  From  this  the  Necessity of future Rewards and Punishments  and from  this  that wide Difference we may reasonably make between ourselves and the Brutesbetween the Powers of inanimate Things or that general Power the Law of Nature and that intellectual  immortal  Being the  Soul  of  Man  That we may not however be accused of leaving the Reader in the dark concerning what we intend by the Word  Conscience  our Meaning is an Impulse naturally implanted in the Soul that infallibly tells us  we should act unto all men as we would have them act to each other  not as we would have them act to us in particular or those we are partial to for in such a Case our Affections would so far prevail that perhaps there would be no such Thing as Justice  or at best very little in the World As for Instance supposing it in my Power ought I to ward off the Punishment due to a Villain because were I in his Circumstances and he in mine I should no doubt be desirous of his doing me the same kind OfficeCertainly No  Conscience  tells us that we should act to each other as Individuals agreeable to the Duty we owe all Mankind  viz  that of promoting the publick Happiness So that when this tender Disposition to Goodness or Goodness of Heart above mentioned influences us to a Pity for any particular Vice or Person that may occasion us to act partially to the Prejudice of the publick Good such a Disposition at that time is so far from being the  Source  of  Virtue  that it is a very great  Weakness  nearly bordering on  actual Vice  itself  Now that there is such an innate Principle implanted in the Soul of Man tho' the Arguments of our opposite Essay allow it I need go no further than to appeal to every Man's self for an Evidence of it  SECT II  The Universality of the Opinion in relation to the Soul's Immortality enquired into  IN the second Section our opposite Essay after having notic'd how extensive and general the Opinion of the Soul's Immortality is which with some Degree of Justice is attributed chiefly to the Prejudice of Education proceeds to examine supposing it not to be communicated by any adventitious Means whether or no it be an  ìnnate  Idea naturally implanted in the Soul And from Mr  Locke  's Denial of the Doctrine of innate Ideas a Conclusion is drawn that this Belief of the Soul's Immortality arises only from the Powers of Reason being vitiated and misled by a certain Pleasure attendant on our Ideas of Immortality and also that it is not owing to the just Exertion of that implanted Knowledge of Truth or Power of judging of the Fitness and Unfitness of Things which notwithstanding the Doctrine of innate Ideas is disallowed is granted to be essential to the Soul  In Answer to this we will take it for Truth that there are no Ideas  innate  any otherwise than our opposite Essay allows It is there asserted that no Man can think otherwise than that  two  and  two  make  four  that when a Globe is exactly fitted into a round Case there is a Fitness between these two Things and such likeThis he is convinced of from that certain and unalterable Impulse within now equally essential to to the Soul equally powerful to establish its own sacred and undeniable Truths is that Impulse called  Conscience  It behoves us then to consider how far may a Man's Conscience convince him that the Soul is immortalbut before we reply to this we shall a little examine the reason given in our opposite Essay as the Source of this OpinionIt says  It is probable that a Man who had never heard of the Soul's being immortal might nevertheless be of that Opinion Yet this Belief is occasioned more by the  Will  influencing or as it were bribing the Reason so to conclude than from the natural Power of judging of Truth which is essential to the Soul For from the Pleasure arising from  our Ideas it is natural for the Soul to will or desire never to be robb'd of that Pleasure which must cease in its Nonexistence  To this an Objection is there proposed by saying  The  Reason  is subject to the  Will  not the  Will  to the  Reason  for you cannot  think  or  perceive  what you  will  This is allow'd true but thus answered  Tho' the  Will  is not the Director of the Reason it can and plainly doth impose false and specious Propositions on the Judgment in favour of its own Cause and the Conclusions form'd in Consequence of these is called Partiality  If this then be the Case that the  Will  doth mislead the  Reason  to conclude from a Desire of the Soul's Immortality that that Doctrine is true why may not a Desire of having it otherwise equally mislead the Reason on the other Side alsoand this is apparently one great Proof that those People who oppose the Immortality of the Soul whatever may be their Pretensions are really very desirous that it should be mortal And this very aptly agrees with the Reflection there made of the Difficulty attending  the Persuasion of People into a Belief of any System against which they are biassed and partial and the easier Concurrence to the Credit of any thing by those who are no ways prejudiced against it After this our opposite Essay proceeds to remark that all or the greatest Part of Mankind have naturally the Desire of Immortality and that the Reflection  Cato  makes is applicable to all  Whence is this pleasing Hope this fond Desire  This longing after Immortality  Or whence this secret Dread and inward Horror  Of falling into nought c  But this is no more evident than the Assertion that the Philosophical Antients believ'd as much as the Moderns this Opinion of the Soul's Immortality of which  Socrates  is brought as an Instance for  Socrates  himself says that the Things relating to the Soul's Immortality were disbelieved by the greatest Part of the World  Cicero  says that his Opinion about the Soul's Immortality was contradicted by most of the  Epicureans  as well as the learned of other Denominations  Aristotle  did not at all believe it as he maintain'd  Death  to be the most terrible Thing in Nature as putting an End to every Thing  Lipsius  says that it was often controverted by the Stoicks who were indeed very dubious concerning the Veracity of itThe learned Dr  Clark  also tells us there were many whole Sects of Philosophers who absolutely denied the Immortality of the Soul and that even the wisest and best of them did not always express themselves with the same Confidence concerning itDr  Prideaux  says it is generally agreed among the Antients that  Pythagoras  was the first  Greek  who taught this Opinion we are also informed by many that the  Egyptians  were the first who asserted the Immortality of the Soul or its Transmigration Now from these Instances it appears that what was in our opposite Essay offer'd for the Argument had very little Veracity in it and I think it very rational to believe that if such a strong Desire of Immortality was essential to the Soul of Man all these Philosophers would have found Reasons of some Kind or other to support themselves in the Belief  of this Doctrine however they might dussent in other Points of less Importance It is also plain that a Man influenced with so strong a Desire of Immortality could not be brought to acquiesce in the Unbelief of it without some very striking Proof to the contrary and I am pretty certain it will be allowed on all Sides that the antient Philosophers had much less to offer against the Doctrine of the Soul's Immortality than even a modern DeistBut let us come now to consider by what Means a Man's Conscience may convince him that the Soul is immortalOur opposite Essay allows that the Necessity of future Rewards and Punishments if true would make strongly for the Immortality of the Soul and says that the Opinion of such a Necessity has been entertained by Philosophers of all AgesNow tho' we dont allow even this Opinion to have been so general as there intimated as it would of necessity have made the Doctrine of the Soul's Immortality equally universal yet we must own these were the Sentiments of the wisest and best of those Philosophers and their only Reason for believing the Soul immortal If it can be prov'd then that this  implanted Impulse call'd  Conscience  can rationally convince a Man that there is a Necessity for future Rewards and Punishments it is plain that the Opinion of the Soul's Immortality is not owing to the  Will  offering specious and deluding Propositions to the Powers of Reason but that it is owing to a just and right Use of those Powers implanted in the Soul that occasions a rational Conviction which is allow'd even in our opposite Essay  to make strongly for the Soul's Immortality  And that this is the Case will evidently appear when we come to consider the sixth Section of that Essay  SECT III  Reasons for the Mortality of the Soul examined  IN this Section of our opposite Treatise is pretended an Examination of the Proofs offer'd in Favour of the Immortality of the Soul wherein the two Corollaries of Dr  Watts  in which he gives his Reasons for supporting that Doctrine are with some Justice shewn to have less Weight than they  are generally supposedNevertheless the Arguments there made use of are very far from supporting the opposite Opinion  The chief Point there controverted and on which the whole Weight of that Section depends is that the Powers of Reflection or Reason are equally liable to be affected by Accidents peculiar to the Body with the Powers of Sensation as is instanc'd by Examples of Lunatics and maim'd Persons And upon this Argument which we will suppose to be true it is concluded that when the Powers of Sensation cease to act by Death the Powers of Reflection cease also and ceasing to  act  consequently cease to  be  And thus the Soul consisting only of these Powers ceases to be or is annihilated  In answer to this if when these Powers cease to  act  they cease to  exist  and if a Lunatic may be entirely incapable of Reason or Reflection as in our opposite Essay is supposed those Powers ceasing to  act  consequently cease to be How comes it then that he is restor'd so as to be capacitated to reflect and judge as nicely as ever unless by the Restoration of the Body  this essential Property of the Soul again exists which is stupidly considering the Soul as owing itself to or a Property of the Body in direct Opposition to what our opposite Essay allows  viz  that the Soul is a Being in itself and not a  Property  belonging to  Matter  Or supposing that while either the Powers of Sensation or Reason remain active we should say the Soul exists as undoubtedly it does and that tho' the Soul in all its Faculties ceasing to be active ceases to  be  tho' several of its essential Qualities may cease to act and yet exist as hereafter will appear yet notwithstanding as the Powers of Reason in our opposite Essay are esteemed the most sublime Faculties of the Soul how comes it that these Powers of Reason may cease to be active and yet those of Sensation retain their native Use and Vigour while if those of Sensation cease to act it is said those of Reflection must cease to act also and accordingly the Soul cease to be And this is allow'd in our opposite Essay where it is asserted a Lunatic that cannot remember reflect or judge may be sensible he hears sees and feels  Now is it not rational to conclude if these essential Powers of  Reflection  or  Reason  can remain inactive and the Powers of  Sensation  perform all their intended Offices that on the other Side those of  Sensation  may cease to act and yet those of  Reflection  remain active and existing Or else we make the Powers of Reason much more liable to be affected with Accidents peculiar to the Body than those of Sensation and so subject the  greater  Faculties of the Soul to the  less  By which means our opposite Essay has been foolishly endeavouring to prove that the Powers of Reflection or Reason are not immortal after having taken it for granted those of Sensation are not which according to this Conclusion are less affected by the Body than those of Reflection  Hence we must certainly conclude that either the Powers of Reason and Sensation as there understood do not perfectly constitute the Soul of Man or that they may cease to  act  or to the utmost of our Apprehension appear so to do without ceasing to  exist  both of which will by and by be made evidentYet for the  present we shall conclude with the former that there may be Souls that have both the Powers of Reflection and Sensation and yet not be essentially the same with the Soul of  Man  What therefore is said in this Section relating to those Powers that are here  suppos'd  or we will allow  prov'd  to be subject to Accidents peculiar to that Body or Part of Matter on which they act does not in the least argue against the Immortality of the  Soul of Man  as it has been prov'd in Sect I it doth not consist only of those Powers  There is also in this third Section of our opposite Essay another Objection endeavour'd to be solv'd or rather evaded and this is one of  Watts  's Assertions that  the Soul cannot lay aside its own thinking it cannot put itself out off Being  To this it is answered that it is possible for a Man to take a Pistol and blow his Brains out by which Action he at once annihilates the Powers of Sensation no inconsiderable Essence of the Soul  We will suppose then in order to reply to this that every Man is so far a free Agent that he may or may not just as he pleases annihilate the Powers of Sensation for Dr  Watts  himself says that the Soul in a separate State from the Body is freed from all the Avocations of Sensations and sensible Things And therefore we may say tho' not very justly  Death  annihilates the Powers of SensationBut what if it does is the Soul thereby annihilated because one particular Property of it is render'd inactive a Property there allow'd essential to it no longer than while acting on the Body and at its Departure from which there seems no manner of Necessity for it to be possessed offCertainly Nounless you will say that a Man born incapable or deprived of several of the Means of Sensation as  hearing seeing  c is not possessed of a perfect human Soul because all the Powers of Sensation essential to the Soul's Existence do not appear to be active so consequently do not exist And this no one will pretend to assert because the Reason why those particular sensative Qualities of the Soul are thus inactive is for the most part apparently occasioned by some Defect in the bodily Organs  of Sensation as is plain from the many Cures that have been performed on Persons born with and long labouring under such Defects I say this no Body will pretend to offer for that Reason unless at the same time it be also asserted that an Oculist that restores a Man born blind to sight adds a new Faculty to his Soul which was before as imperfect as his Body which is in Effect making the Soul owe its Existence to the Body a Manner of Reasoning which as our opposite Essay disallows has no need here of being disproved as else it might easily be  Is it not obvious then from hence that the Powers of  Sensation  are all perfect in the Soul tho' from the Defects of that Body on which it acts it shall not be able to acquire one Idea relative to those Things of which had the Organs of the Body been perfect it must have known something  Hence also it is clearly evident with what has been above said concerning the Powers of Reflection or Reason that those both of Sensation and Reflection may be inactive at least so to our strictest Inquiry and yet have their Existence in the Soul whether acting  on or in a State of Separation from the Body For tho' Dr  Watts  allows the Soul is free from all the Avocations of Sensations and sensible Things when parted from the Body yet it cannot be argued from hence that the Soul is bereft or deprived of the Powers of Sensation any more than that the Soul of a Man which by the Imperfection of his Body is a Stranger to the Avocations of many of these Sensations therefore it is not possessed of those Powers which from what we have just instanc'd is evidently false Thus the Powers of Sensation may exist in the Soul after the Death of the Body and supposing the Truth of the Resurrection of that Body be immediately able to act on it without receiving any new essential Properties of Existence  Neither do those Arguments at all clash with that Axiom of Dr  Watts that the Soul is a constant or perpetual Power of thinking and that upon its ceasing to be active it must immediately cease to be  for even supposing that by Death the Powers of Sensation held essential to the Soul should be annihilated yet if those of Reflection remain active the Soul certainly exists as a perfect Being as  much as when it was acting on a Body whose Defects were such that render'd many of the Powers both of Reflection and Sensation inactive and in this Sense nonexisting  And there is none I believe so absurd as to imagine that tho' a Man should be born blind deaf or devoid of the Faculties of Memory and Reasoning to the greatest Degree on these Accounts his Soul has not as good a Title to Immortality as those Men who are possessed of all these Qualifications  Upon the whole then tho' the first Corollary of Dr  Watts  is remarkable more for the Veracity of its Assertions than for the Weight of Argument in favour of the Soul's Immortality yet his second Corollary appears evidently just and rational  That when the human Body dies the Soul exists and continues to think and act in a separate State And when it is freed from all the Avocations of Sensations and sensible Things it will live more entirely in the Reflection on its own Operations and will commence a State of Happiness  or Misery according to its former Conduct either rejoicing in the Testimony of a good CONSCIENCE or under inward and bitter SelfReproaches from the  Consciousness  of its own Guilt  SECT IV  Reasons to think the Immortality of the Soul necessary  THE first Reason our opposite Essay pretends to take under Consideration is  that it may be thought necessary to the Honour and Wisdom of our great Creator that a Soul possessed of rational Faculties in so high a Degree and capable of such extraordinary Attainments should be continued longer in Being than the short Space of Time allotted for the Life of the Body  In Answer to this it is said that as we are so ignorant of the essential Greatness of the Deity as well as those great and extraordinary Qualifications we may imagine the Soul possessed of we cannot form any just Idea of what Consequence we are in respect to its wonderful and incomprehensible Nature  Well tho' we should allow that all Mankind are as ignorant of the Nature of the divine Being as the most impartial Inquirer among the Deists who will fairly own he knows nothing at all about him yet as by Comparison we may attain in some degree the Ideas of high noble  c  we shall  in the Words of our opposite Essay  by looking round to the sensible Creatures about us and by making some just Comparisons acquire a better Idea of ourselves  Suppose then we should grant that the Brutes each in their Kind act as wisely for the Preservation of themselves and their Species as the wisest and best of Mankind is it not evident that even the necessary Means of our Preservation are infinitely superior to those of Beastsbut this shall appear hereafterAnd tho' we should allow that some of the lowest of Mankind entertain as mean and groveling Ideas of Things as the Brutes is this the least Proof that the Souls of M  n are essentially the same with theirs On the contrary have not we notwithstanding those Appearances the strongest Arguments to conclude even the meanest human Soul has infinitely the Preference when we see  every one of those Animals in some Degree or other subjected to his Use and Service Neither is our Reasoning guilty of any Error in this Point from an innate partial Pride that tells us the Brute Creation live not so much for themselves as for us since it is quite of a different Nature with that Manner of Reasoning which Mr  Pope  exclaims against in the following Lines  In Pride in reas'ning Pride our Error lies  All quit their Sphere and rush into the Skies  Pride still is aiming at the blest Abodes  Men wou'd be Angels Angels wou'd be Gods  And thus again in the following  Ask for what End the heav'nly Bodies shine  Earth for whose Use Pride answers "tis for mine  For me kind  Nature  wakes her genial Pow'r  Suckles each Herb and spreads out ev'ry Flow'r  Annual for me the Grape the Rose renew  The Juice nectareous and the balmy Dew  For me the Mine a thousand Treasures brings  For me Health gushes from a thousand Springs  Seas roll to waft me Suns to light me rise  My Footstool Earth my Canopy the Skies"  Now here the Poet justly lays the Imputation of Pride on Man for presuming to think the numberless Worlds of Light and that vast Universe opening to our Knowledge made only for himselfBut our Reasoning in supposing ourselves of a far superior Nature to those Beings and Things that are subject to us is quite otherwise and that the Brutes are so notwithstanding all the Encomiums he gives them Mr  Pope  himself owns in speakihg of that Instinct that directs them in their Actionshe says  'Twixt that and Reason what a nice Barrier  For ever sep'rate yet for ever near  Rememb'rance and Reflection how ally'd  What thin Partitions Sense from Thought divide  Without this just Gradation could they be  Subjected these to those or  ALL  to  THEE  The Pow'rs of all subdu'd by thee alone  Is not  thy Reason all those Powers  in one  So that nothing can more stupidly or unjustly degrade the Dignity of the human Soul than making it essentially equal to the Brutes or Powers of inanimate Things as  they are in our opposite Essayand tho' the divine Being as  Popc  says  Sees with equal Eye as God of all  A  Hero  perish or a  Sparrow  fall  Atoms or Systems into Ruin hurl'd  And now a Bubble burst and now a World  Yet tho' the one affects him as the supreme Author of all no more than another neither diminishing or increasing the Lustre of any of his essential Perfections are we from thence to infer that a  Hero  is not in this just Gradation of Nature more essentially eminent than a  Sparrow  or that a Bubble of Air and a whole World of rational Creatures are exactly the same the one not more  high  and  noble  than the other I think the most bigotted Deist will own a Conclusion in the Affirmative here stupid indeed  It is true if the Soul of Man in its highest Perfections was capable of no better Reasoning there would be Room sufficient for us to conclude the Souls of Brutes essentially equal to our own Since these Sentiments so well become them as the above  I hope not too often  quoted Author instances  where in exposing the false Reasonings of Pride he says  While Man exclaims "See all Things for my Use"  See Man for mine replies a pamper'd Goose  What Care to tend to lodge to cram to treat him  All this he knew but not that 'twas to eat him  As far as  Goose  cou'd judge he reason'd right  But as to  Man  mistook 'the Matter quite  It may be thought indeed that Mr  Pope  argues strongly against this Supposition of the Brutes being so far beneath us and that he lays us upon a Level in the following Lines which for their extraordinary Beauty and Elegance I cannot forbear quotingSpeaking to Man  Has God thou Fool work'd solely for thy Good  Thy Joy thy Pastime thy Attire thy Food  Who for thy Table feeds the wanton Fawn  For him as kindly spreads the flow'ry Lawn  Is it for thee the Lark ascends and sings  Joy tunes his Voice Joy elevates his Wings  Is it for thee the Linnet pours his Throat  Loves of his own and Raptures swell the Note  The bounding Steed you pompously bestride  Shares with his Lord the Pleasure and the Pride  Is thine alone the Seed that strews the plain  The Birds of Heav'n shall vindicate their Grain  Thine the full Harvest of the golden Year  Part pays and justly the deserving Steer  The Hog that plows not nor obeys thy Call  Lives on the Labours of this  Lord of all  It may be thought I say that here our Poet lays us upon an Equality with the Brutes because he intimates that we are useful to the Beasts as well as they to us and that their own Pleasure and Satisfaction excites them to the Services they pay us This is very far from being a  just  Conclusion for the same Author when he says Nature  Made Beast in Aid of Man and Man of Beast  gives a comparative Degree of  Eminence  by saying that the  One all extending all preserving Soul Connects each Being  GREATEST  with the  LEAST  Is it not idle then to conclude that because this Author says  Know Nature's Children all divide her Care  The Fur that warms a Monarch warm'd a Bear  that he thought a  Bear  a Creature of equal Dignity with a  Monarch  I think it extreamly so  Neither doth it at all appear that because every Creature that is of Service to Man is so from SelfLove or from an innate Pleasure attending on its Actions and not from a Design of obliging Mankind it is not evident I say because of this that those Creatures are created less for the Service of Man or more for themselves As in this there appears the infinite Wisdom of our great Creator in rendering that a Pleasure to every Creature which answers the End of its Creation which in the Brutes is that I conceive of being serviceable in some Degree to  Man  Now the Reason why Man acts to serve the BruteCreation is partly from SelfLove and  partly thro' Compassion as Mr  Warburton  elegantly obsevesFor says he  Reason  endowing Man with the Ability of setting the Memory of the past and conjecturing about the future and past Misfortunes making him apprehensive of more to come this disposes him to pity and relieve others in a State of Suffering and the Passion growing habitual naturally extendeth its Effects to all that have a Sense of Suffering  So far thro' CompassionBut continues he  This is not all Man's Interest Amusement Vanity and Luxury tie him close to the System of Benevolence by obliging him to provide for the Support of other Animals and tho' it be for the most part only to devour them with the greater Gust yet this does not abate the proper Happiness of the Animals so preserved to whom Providence has not given the useless Knowledge of their End  So that from hence it is plain that every Creature in the Brute Creation tho' acting from Principles in themselves and for their own Happiness may yet be justlyesteemed as living for the Use and Service of Man  Now that Man doth not live in the same Manner for the Use of Beasts is evident because the chief Services that Men perform to the Brutes are from political Ends for  Man cares for all to Birds he gives his Woods  To Beasts his Pastures and to Fish his Floods  That very Life his learned Hunger craves  Saves from the Famine from the Savage saves  Nay feasts the Animal he dooms his Feast  And till he ends the Beings makes it blest  And that SelfLove is the ruling Principle in Man with respect to the animal Creation is plain since he either preserves or destroys them just as his Interest or Inclination leads him  It will further appear that the Brute Creation were particularly designed for the Service of Mankind by that very Instinct or innate Pleasure which they feel in acting according to their Natures and which in the Comparison between Brutes and Men in our opposite Essay is brought to prove their essential Equality in rational Knowledge And this will be evident in their Actions being  instrumental to the Instruction of Man and Improvement of his Reason as the Poet says  To copy Instinct then was Reason's Part  Thus then to Man the Voice of Nature spake  Go from the Creatures thy Instructions take  Learn from the Birds what Food the Thickets yield  Learn from the Beast the Physic of the Field  Thy Arts of building from the bee receive  Learn of the Mole to plow the Worm to weave  c  Great Nature spoke observant Man obey'd  Cities were built Societies were made  c  Thus every Way it is plain that the animal Creation live for the Use and Service of Man who is the superior Creature in his own System of Knowledge and in the  Scripture  Phrase  Lord of all  in that System But whether Man may not be equally serviceable to some Degree of Beings as much above him as the Brutes are below him as may be thought to be hinted by this Line  From Brutes what Men from Men what Spirits know  is not at all to the Purpose or supposing it to be true shall we because we must submit to own there may be Beings of a superior Nature for whose Use as well as ours the vast Universe may be designed shall we I say degrade ourselves so much as to own we are essentially the same with the  lowest  because we are not of the  highest  Order of BeingsI think this is not at all Reason  We may therefore acquire both the Ideas of  high  and  noble  with respect to the essential Qualifications of human Nature and therefore  it is  a Reason why it may be thought necessary to the Honour and Wisdom of our great Creator that a Soul possessed of rational Faculties in so high a Degree should be continu'd longer existing than the short Space of Time allotted for the Life of the Body  The second Reason in this Section of our opposite Essay that is considered as supporting the Doctrine of the Soul's Immortality is the seeming Necessity of future Rewards and Punishments which Principle it is there said can have no other  solid Foundation in the rational Mind than the abstracted Notions of  Virtue  and  Vice  For if our Actions were neither good or evil where is the Necessity of Rewards or PunishmentsIt then proceeds to determine what is Virtue and its opposite Vice  SECT V  Virtue and Vice their Foundation and Essence considered  THERE has been nothing says our opposite Essay in all the Systems of Philosophers so much contested as this  What are Virtue and Vice  This Point indeed has been surprizingly debated considering that every Man tho' he has no Faith at all in Revelation has naturally implanted in him  a sacred Impulse  that can never fail of convincing him if consulted how he ought to act being a just Standard of Wrong and RightIt is something strange therefore that Men should dispute on Terms whose Meaning they are all sensible to be but one and the same Truth  With respect to the Essence of Virtue we shall agree with our opposite Essay in the  Words of Mr  Brown  that it is no other than  the Conformity of our Affections with the public Good or the voluntary Production of the greatest Happiness  and the opposite to this consequently Vice  We will proceed then to consider the Foundation or Source of this  Virtue  in the Soul of Man  Dr  Watts  allows the Source of Virtue to be that innate  Knowledge of Truth  implanted in the Soul whereby we judge of the Fitness and Unfitness of Things But our former Essay chuses because of some little Inconsistencies seemingly attendant on that System to declare it is that  pathetic Instinct  and  Disposition toward Goodness  as  Watts  calls it or as it is called there  Goodness of Heart  and not the  Knowledge of Truth  that is the Cause of moral Virtue And yet our opposite Essay is afterward obliged to bring in this Knowledge of Truth as essential to Virtue in assisting this Disposition to Goodness in its Offices without which it is there made plain that Disposition would not be apprehensive when to act justly and upon that Power of judging of  Truth being vitiated or misled this Disposition to Goodness does not contribute to Virtue  Now the Powers both of Goodness of Heart and the Knowledge of Truth are here made equally essential to the Production of Virtue and both are in Reality equally incapable of that Office since it is owned on the opposite Side of the Question that the Powers of Reason may be misled by specious Propositions being offered to them by the Inclinations and Passions attending human Nature as it is said in the th Section of our opposite Essay  Many People run into Vice by becoming familiar to Actions which at first a seeming Necessity for imposes upon the Reason to conclude in some Measure justifiable As a Man that is starving might possibly prevail on his Reason to conclude that his Condition extenuates the Crime of his robbing on the Highway and he may silence his natural Disposition to Pity or Goodness of Heart from a specious Supposition that the Losers may not be in a Condition to want and therefore Misery may not be the Consequence of such an Action And  thus he goes on from one Step to another till this natural Disposition to Goodness is not apprehensive when to exert itself  From hence it is own'd that the Powers of judging of Truth are incapable of influencing this allowed innate Goodness of Heart at all Times to Virtue Bút that it is subject to Deception and may be led to Actions of Vice and at the same time imagine such Actions not criminal And with respect to Goodness of Heart it is evident from what has been said in Sect of this Essay that the Liberty of its Action would in many Cases produce actual Vice and that it equally may or may not be instrumental to Virtue  Now all these Difficulties seem'd to be solved in adjudging the Foundation of Virtue to that Power I call  Conscience  and which I believe is the same Impulse that Dr  Watts  meant by his Term  the innate Knowledge of Truth  But by the Definition he gives of it our opposite Essay makes it appear that in its acting on the same Principles it will sometimes produce Happiness and sometimes Misery so consequently be  Virtue and Vice alternately as is exampled in the breaking or keeping of Contracts  And as that Disposition to Goodness before spoke of as the Source of Virtue is when not influenced by Justice a very weak if not vicious Faculty in the Soul so is this innate Knowledge of Truth also for tho' this Power may be justly conscious that two and two make four and that certain moral Duties are as justly requisite as  Watts  supposes yet as this Power relating to Numbers however justly conscious it may be  that two and two make four three times three nine  c it is liable to draw Conclusions opposite to these in the Calculation of perplexed and intricate Ratios So relating to moral Duties tho' this Power the innate Knowledge of Truth may convince a Man that he ought to act justly and that in judging between two Men he ought not to be partial to either yet it may so happen from a Combination of perplex'd and intricate Circumstances that those very Means he takes to do this tho' the best that appear to his most impartial Reason are the very reverse to the Justice intended  So also it may happen from our Inability of foreseeing future Events that the Means taken to promote the greatest public Happiness allow'd in our opposite Essay to be Virtue may be the very Means to promote the Contrary  From hence then appears the Insufficiency of that innate Power of Reason to direct us in the common Affairs of Life Surely then that very Reason will dictate to us how insufficient itself is to determine in what Degree we stand with respect to that Power that gave us Being and how little or how much we possess of its Nature in its Immortality  But from this it may be objected if I allow so much the Insufficiency of Reason to determine this how can I pretend to  prove  what I am attemptingTo this I say I attempt  rationally  to  prove  it Now the strongest Argument that can be drawn from the impartial Powers of Reason is all the  Proof  Reason can give So that a rational Proof can have no other Meaning than the most probable Conclusion that can be drawn  from an impartial Enquiry into the Point in Question  It appears then the most probable Conclusion to adjudge the Source of moral Virtue to that Power called  Conscience  And then the Case will stand thus every Man havïng within him this sacred Impulse should act upon all Occasions according to its Dictates and as this Power was given by our Creator to every Man under Heaven ro distinguish him from the Brutes and make him worthy of being what his Maker design'd him the Chief of all his own System it will infallibly convince him whenever his Inclinations and Passions will permit him to listen to its Decision whether or no he acts right So that seeing the Insufficiency of our innate Knowledge of Truth a Man does not commit a virtuous Action when going contrary to the Dictates of his Conscience even tho' the strongest Appearances of the Consequence of that Action should be the Promotion of the greatest public Happiness And a Man ought never to act contrary to the Dictates of that Conscience tho' the Consequence of his Actions should appear  that  of promoting  public Misery For as no Man can think that the Author of all Things implanted that Principle in our Souls for any other Design than that of promoting our general Happiness is it not stupidly presumptuous to think our Creator knew less than we the necessary Means to that Happiness It is also plain that if Mankind were void of those base Inclinations and Passions which are allowed on all hands to be the Occasion of the greatest Part of our Miseries and acted from the unprejudiced Dictates of their Consciences that we should have no Necessity for Divinity Politics or Law But as it is otherwise every Man being born with those Passions in some Degree we find that innate Impulse is not sufficient to influence us to  that  Virtue it is an infallible Judge of I don't say that a true Believer in the System of Christianity is not virtuous from a much more noble and sacred Principle than this of ConscienceI reason here as a  Deist  and am fixing the Foundation of moral Virtue in the  rational  not the  religious  Mind  It may perhaps be asked here to what Purpose then is that innate Power of judging of Truth implanted in the Soul if it is not  to direct the Mind to Actions of Virtue or to what Purpose that innate Goodness or Tenderness of Heart before spoke ofI answerThey are both necessary to promote the public Happiness and yet neither of them indispensably necessary to constitute a Man  virtuous  And tho' I allow the Criterion or Test of Virtue is the Conformity of our Affections with the public Good I allow it because I affirm that acting from the Dictates of Conscience is Virtue and that if all Men were to act from those Dictates the World would be compleatly happy Yet nevertheless as the Passions and Inclinations of Mankind as has been before observed are so prevalent as often to silence this sacred Impulse this  pathetic Disposition to Goodness  is necessary to excite Benevolence and the  Power of Reasoning of the Fitness and Unfitness of Things  to direct that Benevolence in the Promotion of the public Happiness  Now it is possible for a Man out of an extraordinary Tenderness of Mind and from an uncommon Share of Reasoning to be greatly instrumental to the public Good and yet at the same time be less virtuous than a Man who is more guided by the  Impulse of his Conscience and has less of either of those other Powers in his Nature Thus a Man that equally acts from the Dictates of his Conscience with another will be equally virtuous notwithstanding the superior Powers of Reason and Benevolence in the one render him far more conducive to the public HappinessThis will appear in the following Instance Suppose two Men were separately to judge and decide the same Cause both of them equally acting from the Convictions of Conscience The one having naturally a great deal of Compassion and therefore very desirous of having Justice done to the Sufferer having also a large Share of the Powers of Reason to enable him to detect and unriddle a specious contriv'd Evidence formed to screen the Guilty He therefore gives his Decision in favour of the Innocent The other having less natural Tenderness to sympathize with the Distressed does not see the Injuries committed in the same Light therefore is less excited to give the Cause on that Side and having also less of the Power of Reason to judge in an intricate Cause is led astray by the artful Pretensions offered on the Side of the Offender and therefore he  gives his Decision directly opposite to Justice Now both these Men are equally virtuous tho' the Consequence of their Actions so opposite to each other can never be thought to conduce equally to the public Good For the Act of the Conscience is as just in one as the other as the Cause tho' it is in Reality the same to both is not so to the Consciences of both if it was their Decision would have been the same and it is undoubtedly no Crime in a Man to judge  wrong  if he judges to the best of his Knowledge  right  Upon the whole therefore it is evident that neither that innate Power of judging of Truth or that pathetic Instinct call'd Goodness of Heart is the Source of moral Virtue and notwithstanding they are both requisite to balance the Frailties of human Nature and by that to preserve the necessary Medium of the public Happiness yet Actions of Virtue have another Foundation and arise from an infallible Consciousness within the Soul that never influences us to one Action whatever may be its Consequence contrary to Virtue  Now our opposite Effay says  Where is the Justice or Necessity that Men should be punished or rewarded for acting from Principles which they did not give themselves nor can possibly divest themselves of  Certainly there is noneand therefore no one will be punished for acting from that sacred Principle in the Soul his Conscience  If there be a Man then that laying his Hand on his Heart and asking his Soul the Question can reply to himself that he has always acted agreeable to that Principle whatever may have been the Effect of his Actions whether Happiness or Misery to himself or others he may rest assured he has nothihg to fear from future Punishments And this he may safely do if he has had ever so little of this pathetic Disposition to Goodness in his Nature or has been ever so weak in his rational Determinations The more indeed a Man has of the former the more Pain he will feel in doing justice to the Guilty and the more Pleasure in protecting the Innocent and the more Judgment he has in the latter the better he will be capacitated to do both and make the public Happiness oftner the Consequence of his Virtue  SECTVI  The Necessity of future Rewards and Punishments examin'd  HAving now very plainly prov'd and of which every Man is an Evidence to himself that  Virtue  and  Vice  do exist in the Nature of the Soul and what they indisputably are we come now to examine the Necessity of future Rewards and Punishments Which it has been allow'd if the Actions of Men were neither good or bad there would be no need at all of  But seeing it is quite the contrary and that there is no Man whose Conscience can assure him he never disobey'd its Dictates we must own we are all guilty And as Misery is the necessary Consequence of Vice all of us must have a Share in Proportion to that Guilt And on the other hand as Happiness is the Consequence of Virtue every Man must have his Share in Proportion to that Obedience he has paid his Conscience  And it is in vain to form an Objection to this by saying our Actions whether good or ill cannot affect the supreme Being This is not all to the PurposeHe has implanted a Law in our Hearts and ourselves are the Umpires to determine it So that if a Man cannot upon his Conscience acquit himself of all Guilt it is in vain even if he could justly say he has hurt Nobody but himself For that Man equally acts contrary to this Law given him by his Creator when he acts prejudicial to himself as when he offends others So that supposing the divine Being should inflict a Punishment on us in Return for our Vices we see here his infinite Wisdom in the contriving it since he is not excited to it from any Prejudice our Actions are capable of doing to him but is called upon to do it by that Sentence of Condemnation every Man passes on himself For as has been before observ'd if there be a Man whose Conscience can acquit him he may be certain whatever he be that the supreme Being will acquit him also  It is clearly evident then from what has been offer'd that there is a Necessity Misery should be the Consequence of a Man's being  vicious and Happiness the Reward of his Virtue And from this there will appear a great deal of Reason to expect a FUTURE Distribution of this Happiness and Misery according to the Part every Man has acted in this Life  Our opposite Essay in Contradiction to this would infer  that the supreme Being doth actually dispense Justice to all the human Race tho' by Means inexplicable to us in this World and that the Ballance of Happiness and Misery is adjusted at the Death of every Man  And this is offer'd to invalidate that apparent Necessity of such a  future  Distribution  from the Sickness Anguish and Persecution of the Virtuous in their Lifetime while many of the Wicked seem to be entirely free from those Inconveniencies  We shall therefore just consider the Weight of this InferenceIt is allowed that if Justice is dispers'd to us in this World it is done by  inexplicable Means  but by whatever Means it may be suppos'd to be done it is undoubtedly evident we should be sensible  that it was done or else that Man's Conscience is a Liar that arraigns him in his last Moments for Actions which the Miseries daily attendant on human Nature have accounted for  But to corroborate what our opposite Essay here affirms it is said it is impossible to tell how much Vice is atton'd for by the Pains of the Body and Mind by which it is insinuated that a raging Fit of the  Gout  or  Toothach  may be inflicted on Mankind as a sufficient Reward for their VicesThis is a Manner of Reasoning suited to the Deists indeed for can any rational Man conceive that such Incidents are adequate Punishments for our Crimes or if they were that these are so distributed between the Virtuous and the Wicked as to make up their Ballance of Happiness and Misery in this LifeCertainly NoStupid resolutely stupid indeed must they be who can sit down with such Conclusions  Suppose indeed we allow that these Frailties constantly' attendant on human Nature are the Effect of Vice in general is it not ridiculous from thence to infer they are  so of Vices in particularIs it a Crime in a Man that being necessitated by the Business of Life he runs in Danger of Misfortunes incident to such Business and really falls under those Misfortunes  Is it a Crime for a Man to catch a Cold or be particularly liable to tormenting DiseasesThere needs no Reply to these QuestionsAnd if our Reason is capable of determining any thing few things are more easy than for us to be sensible that the Miseries daily incident to Mankind with respect to Diseases and other Misfortunes of the Body and Mind are distributed amongst us without any partial Distinction relating to Vice or Virtue in the Persons afflicted with them For the  Sun shines upon the Unjust as well as the Just  And the vicious Man is equally intitled to the Blessings of Nature in this World as well as the Virtuous  Neither is it at all contradictory our granting that sometimes in the Ways of Providence Virtue may eminently meet its Reward in this World or that Vice may meet as conspicuous and remarkable a Punishment  Yet when the Instances on this Side are set in Competition with the many of those in which Virtue has been degraded and Vice bore away in Triumph that Approbation and Reward which should have been paid to its Opposite we shall find ourselves inclin'd to think the good Things of this Life rather the Concomitants of Vice than Virtue  Hence then we must conclude from the strongest Appearances of Reason that these Weaknesses of Nature so far from yielding us satisfactory Cause to think them Punishments for Vice are very convincing Proofs of the Necessity that there must be others and in a Life after this  Our opposite Essay then has here advanced nothing to disprove the Necessity of future Rewards and Punishments  With the same Weakness also is advanced a pretended Parallel of Justice in the Designs of our Creator with Respect to us and the BrutesIt says  In whatsoever Degree we are pleas'd to consider ourselves above the Brute Creation Nobody will deny but that the great Creator acts with impartial Justice towards  every one even the most minute and insignificant of his CreaturesWhy is it then that a Horse Dog or Cat shall be nourished and fed with all the Necessaries of Life while others of their Species shall be subject to hard Labour Whipping or being worried to Death  From whence it is inferred that our great Creator dispenses Justice to these Creatures supposing them mortal in this Life and if to them why not by some such Means to us But before we pretend to determine whether or no such Sufferers as these are to be recompenced or to have Justice done them as here suppos'd it is proper we should know what Injustice there would be done them if such Recompence and supposed Justice were neglected and I think it is obvious none at all  Supposing the Beasts free from any Imputation of Guilt whereby they may be thought to deserve either more or less of their Creator what Right in the true Idea of Justice have they to expect any thing more from their Maker than he has been pleased to confer on them  Shall the Clay reply unto the Potter wherefore hast thou fashioned  me thus  Has not the supreme Being undoubtedly a just Right to do what he pleases with every Particle of Matter and every Power in the UniverseMost certainly he has And therefore it is no Injustice to any Creature that it is made more vile or less happy than another seeing it has no Merit at all in itself nor more than a Creature that is less happy than it  Has  Man  then any Right to  reply  to his Maker even supposing that acting from the Passions and Inclinations of his Nature he has not the least Imputation of Guilt laid to his Charge Has he any Right to complain that these Evils attendant on his mortal Frame are  unjustly  laid on him tho' he be supposed free from Guilt and therefore it may be said he deserves not to be afflicted with Pain yet as he can have not the least Merit but what was conferred on him what Title has he to the least Satisfaction or Pleasure  If therefore we enjoy the Blessings and Comforts of Humanity without deserving them with equal Justice the Sufferings and Inconveniencies of it may be inflicted on us  without which those Blessings and Comforts would be less sweet and less valuable than they now are  Thus it is extremely clear that nothing is more rational than for us to conclude there is a Necessity of  future Rewards  and  Punishments  not only from our abstracted Notions of  Virtue  and  Vice  but from the Sickness Anguish and Persecutions of the Virtuous in this Life while many of the Wicked are much more free from those Embarrasments  If then there be a Necessity for a future Distribution of Justice the Opinion of the Soul's Immortality has not its Source from a vitiated Power of Reasoning but has its Foundation naturally implanted in the Soul And seeing it is so it is no Wonder that Opinion is so extensive But on the contrary it is something remarkable that it was not so  universal  or rather so  general  in the earliest Ages of the World as it is now  Having now considered the Objections made to the Proofs and apparent Reasons for the Immortality of the human Soul and  finding them irrational and groundless we will proceed to examine the Reasons that induce some Men to think it otherwise To this End we are led to consider our Relation to those Creatures whom we don't scruple to pronounce have no Title to Immortality  SECT VII  Our Relation to the Brute Creation consider'd  IN this Section of our opposite Essay is drawn a Parallel betwen Mankind and the Brutes respecting the Constitution and necessary Preservation of the BodyWe are subject to Death as they areWe cannot live without Sustenance any more than they are as liable in our Natures to Hurts Pains and Diseases as theyand the like  From this Manner of Comparison therefore should be inferred a Similarity affecting the essential Dignity of Brutes and Men or else it is of no Use to the Point in Debate And yet it is plain no such Inference is drawn For after this it is allowed that all Matter is  essentially  the same and differs only in its Modification but that the  different Modification of Matter gives it no superior or inferior Degree of Merit So that this Parallel relating to the Bodies of Men and Brutes can have no other Effect than to convince us they are both equally liable to Pains Diseases and Death A Truth sufficiently evident without any great rational Enquiry And yet such Arguments as these are thought of great Consequence among the Deists and make up great Part of their  learned  and  rational  Systems For which Reason it is introduced in this DisquisitionWe shall therefore pass over this Section with only remarking agreeable to our opposite Essay that the Form or Body of Man gives him no manner of Title to Immortality or any Preeminence in the Order of Beings to the Brutes But there being Instances of Creatures so nearly resembling the Human as well as the Brute Species that it has been impossible to determine by their Form to which they most properly belong'd it is therefore we may justly conclude that whatever may be the Form or Properties of Bodies animated by Souls of any Degree that the Similarity of these Properties is not the least Indication of the essential Similarity of such Souls  We shall therefore proceed now to examine how nearly the Souls of Brutes and Men resemble each other  SECT VIII  The Souls of Brutes and Men compared  OUR opposite Essay here says that because it is not allowed that Spirit is a Property of Matter but that the Soul either of a Brute or Man is an existent Being the actuating Principle of a Brute must therefore be of the same Kind with that of Man as if it was impossible that two Beings should be essentially different And then it proceeds to say what possible Degree of Inferiority suppose the lowest can affect any Being so much as to make it mortal while another Being  acting in the same Manner  is immortal Here again it is taken for granted that two Beings because such and not Properties of Beings must act in the  same Manner  without considering their essential Properties To determine therefore whether they act in the same Manner or how far they are essentially similar we will compare a just Definition of the Soul of Man with the most exalted One of that of the Brute  We have in the first Section of this Essay shewn the great Imperfection of the Definition there repeated of the human Soul which is indeed as applicable to the Brutes as to some of Mankind  Suppose then that we allow agreeable to the Conclusions drawn in Section the ninth of our opposite Essay that the Souls of Brutes are capable as well as some Men to reflect judge and reason of Causes and their Effects the ultimate End of their Actions is their own Preservation and Benefit and the Source of them an innate SelfLove that directs them to that End  This is the most noble Definition that can possibly be given of the Soul of Brutes  Now having made it evident that the Soul of Man having implanted in it the sacred Impulse of his Conscience acts not only rationally from SelfLove to his own Preservation and Benefit but from the Dictates of that Conscience impartial and just It is equally evident that it is by much essentially superior to that of the Brute and that their Manner of Acting is widely  different And this Conclusion is just even tho' we allow that the Powers of Reason are in the Brute superior to those in some Men whom we do not scruple to pronounce have immortal Souls  Our opposite Essay says take the most ignorant of all the human Species and compare his intellectual Faculties to those of a  Locke  a  Newton  or a  Boyle  What a wonderful Difference and yet we allow the one a Soul as immortal as the other undoubtedlyA Man who thro' the natural Weakness of his Understanding may be incapable of entertaining any but the most simple and obvious Truths may yet act more from the Dictates of his Conscience than another who with all the Advantages of intellectual Powers is capacitated to entertain every Branch of the most intricate Knowledge An artless illiterate Plowman may be a more conscientious or virtuous Man than the most learned and wise Philosopher  So that the Dignity of the rational Powers in the Soul does not determine its Immortality notwithstanding we have allow'd  in Sect th of this Essay that the extraordinary Acquirements of those Powers in the human Soul may justly give us Reason to believe our End shall not be like that of those Animals whose Understandings are calculated to render them obedient or in some Degree serviceable to Man  Now as it appears that the essential Properties of the Souls of Brutes and Men are not the same and that their Manner of Acing is not the same the Argument offered on this Supposition has no Weight at all  We shall not here pretend to justify Bishop  Burnet  's Supposition that because the Souls of Brutes are incapable of Good or Evil Rewards or Punishments therefore they may be perpetually rolling about from one Body to another neither shall we commend Dr  Watts  for giving up the Decision relating to these Souls in which tho' he might be at a Loss to determine whether the Brutes have Souls or no he might easily have made it evident that supposing they had Souls they were not only of an  inferior  but of a  different  Nature to the Souls of Men And therefore no Conclusion could be drawn let the Case be  decided either Way with Respect to their having or not having Souls that could affect the Nature Reason or Religion of Mankind  SECT IX  The Understanding of Men and Brutes considered  HAVING already determined that no comparative Degree in the rational Faculties of the Soul can entitle any Creature more or less to Immortality We enter on the Subject of this ninth Section meerly to consider whether or no the Sagacity appearing in the Actions of Brutes may not be better accounted for than by our attributing to them the Powers of Reason  It is said in our opposite Essay that as the  same Effect  must proceed from the  same Cause  therefore many of the Actions of the Beasts being reasonable they must be endowed with Reason It is true they act wisely for the Service and Preservation of their Species but this no Proof they act  rationally  for tho' Men sometimes or for the most Part acting rationally do contribute  to the Service and Preservation of Mankind yet so imperfect are those rational Powers in the Soul in foreseeing the consequence of our Actions that it often happens that acting according to the most reasonable Design of promoting Good proves the Production of Evil  Thus then the remarkable Sagacity of the Brutes in their own Preservation is no Proof they are possessed of Reason because the Powers of Reason are not always productive of that Preservation And it is plain that Instinct serves the Purposes of the Animal equally as well as or better than Reason  For as Mr  Pope  says  Where'er full Instinct is th' unerring Guide  What Pope or Council can they need beside  Now that  Reason  and  Instinct  are not the same Powers as our opposite Essay would infer will be evident in comparing both The Powers of  Reason  are capable of entertaining Knowledge and of making surprizing progressive Improvements in that Knowledge by Inventions and Discoveries many of them to the Destruction not the Preservation of their Species And while  these Inventions have been formed to the Prejudice of Mankind equally ingenious have been the Improvements made on the other Hand for their Benefit Thus Discovery advancing upon Discovery each succeeding Age has acted in a different Sphere of Wisdom and the necessary Means of our Preservation are so far superior to those of the BruteCreation that they are infinitely greater than those of Men in former Ages  Our progressive Knowledge in Arts and Sciences the necessary Means of the Service and Preservation of Mankind sufficiently evidence this  Now the Knowledge of the Brutes and the necessary Means they take for their Preservation are undoubtedly the same as they were four Thousand Years ago  It may be objected to this indeed by saying that Man having invented other Means for the Destruction of the Beasts than were practis'd in the earliest Ages we must conclude from hence that the Brutes take their more improv'd Methods for their Preservation  This Objection however has very little in it for supposing that a Beast does now very prudently avoid Means taken for its Destruction which those of former Ages never met with this is no Proof that its rational Faculties are more invested with Knowledge than its Predecessors since had the same Circumstance attended a Beast of the same Kind many Centuries ago we have not the least room to imagine but that it would have avoided that Circumstance with equal Circumspection and Prudence  The Difference between the Powers of Instinct and Reason will further appear in comparing the Effects of both  In Man we are obliged to own that the Powers of Reason given him by his Creator are not sufficient to acquaint him with the Sciences of Commerce and Government in their greatest Perfections without long Application and Study and that these Arts have risen to such Perfections has been owing to the gradual Improvement made by Men of the most refined and extensive Understandings  In Brutes we see no Improvement of their SciencesThe Bees always had the same unalterable Laws and Politics as now The Pismire the same OeconomyThe Spider the same Art and every other Animal the same Knowledge in these Respects as nowAnd it is plain these Sciences are not in them the Production of  Reason  but of Instinct for if of Reason wherever there was an equal Share of the Cause there would be so of the Effect and as Man is allowed in his highest Perfections to have a greater Share of Reason than any of the Brutes he would undoubtedly be more able to act as they do and yet who like the Spider  can Parallels design  Sure as  De Moiyre  without Rule or Line  Now so far from our Reason's being able to direct us in this we cannot devise by what Means it is done  So the wonderful Mechanism of the Birds each in its several Kind singular and inimitable not only impracticable to us but to Creatures so little remov'd from  them in their Species that we can scarce tell the Difference unless by these Indications of their particular Instinct  In the Mechanism of Men we see even the strongest Genius must be indebted to long Application and Practice before he excels in any Art whereas in that of the Brutes we see the first Attempt equal in Beauty and Elegance to the last  It is possible this last Assertion may be denied as it is the Custom of Deistical Disputants to deny every Thing that they think cannot easily be proved tho' there be not the least Room to question its Veracity but while there is not one Reason brought to make us doubt this to be Truth why should we question the most impartial Evidence of our Senses  Upon the whole then there appears the strongest Probability for us to conclude that the Sagacity of the Brutes respecting their Actions is not the Effect of  Reason  but of  Instinct  And this is their unerring Guide  But whether this be so or no and tho' the Brutes should be equally possess'd of rational Faculties with Mankind all their Sagacity cannot as has been before proved give them the least Title to Immortality  SECT X  On the  Probability  and  Possibility  of the  Soul's Immortality  with a rational Definition of  God  IN this last Section of our opposite Essay it is inferred from the Similarity of natural Powers in their Beginning Progress and Decays that all Powers are subject to Annihilation because it is exampled that many of them may cease to act and as Spirit or Power is allowed to be nothing but Action and upon its Cessation of Acting it must cease to be therefore they may be annihilated  It is also asserted that all these Powers whether acting on inanimate Things by apparent Necessity or rationally and freely as is supposed in Men and Brutes yet as  effect of the same Cause they must be all exactly of the same Nature and therefore all equally subject to AnnihilationHere then is the pretended Possibility of the Mortality of the SoulThe Probability is drawn from the Cessation of Action or the Annihilation of these Powers after the Dispersion of that Part of Matter in which they acted  In Answer to the formerIf as Effects of the same Cause all these Powers are essentially the same every Thing that is the Effect of the Being of God must be exactly the same too and then a Man a Horse a Tree a Mushroom have no essential Difference and yet supposing this to be true it is evident that with respect to Duration of Existence there is a wide Distinction And tho' we allow that the Powers acting on Plants are the same in one Plant as another yet we see some flourish but a few Days and die others again are more than an hundred Years in arriving to their Perfection so that the Power which acts on a Mushroom may exist but for a Day or twoThat upon a Flower something longer  and that upon an Aloe a Century of Years If this then proves no essential Difference their being of the same Nature with the Soul of Man does not at all argue that  that  Soul may not exist ten thousand Years or to all Eternity  In answer to the latterNotwithstanding the Powers acting on inanimate Things as Plants Trees  c  may be annihilated upon the Dispersion of that Matter on which they act it is because the proper Frame of that Matter is immediately affected by their acting whereas the Souls of Men and Brutes are allow'd capable of acting on them selves that is by Reflection for tho' the Organs of the Body in this State of Union are assistant to the Powers of Reflection yet the Consequence drawn from Propositions  c  is a pure Act of the Soul Hence then the Power of acting on Men and Brutes must be left out of this System and the Arguments already advanced have not only more than amounted to a Probability that the Soul of Man is immortal but have proved it necessary on account of that sacred Impulse implanted in him called  Conscience  Now our opposite Essay not supposing the Beasts capable of Virtue and Vice 'twould be needless to prove they are void of that Impulse as they undoubtedly are and of which if required might be given undeniable Demonstration but as all the Reasons offer'd in Opposition to the Immortality of the Soul of Man in that Essay which are the great Artillery of the Deists are sufficiently confuted in their own Manner of Reasoning I have finished the Design of these Disquisitions  From what has been proved then to judge of the Essence of GodIt is rational to conclude we are not left so ignorant of his Nature as only to know him as the first Cause of all Things and no further Every Man from the Dictates of Conscience is obliged to own that the Author of all Things has a Right to dispose of them at his Pleasure therefore there can be no  Injustice  in the divine Being and this Source of moral Virtue in the Mind convinces us it being the only infallible Impulse in human Nature and coming from that first Cause that this is the truest Image of God Therefore  the divine Being must be all Virtue and Holiness The daily Works of Providence must fill every Man with Ideas of the infinite Wisdom and Power of this first CauseSo that it is evident that the Author of all Things or GOD is infinitely  wise holy just  and  powerful  and tho' our Ideas of  Holiness Wisdom  c are the Effect of the rational conscientious Mind as a secondary Cause yet they have their  Foundation  in God And though they may fall short of giving us a compleat Definition of the divine Being they are just though faint Copies of its infinite Perfections  Since the Cause is really so then and the rational Powers are so subject to Error is it not to the Interest of every Man instead of perplexing himself with metaphysical Questions to enquire whether he acts according to the Dictates of his Conscience  For however other Points may be determined this is of the last Importance and perhaps the only one in which he is an infallible Judge  And with respect to reveal'd Systems of Religion the Believers of them if false can be no Sufferers in the End if they act equally in Obedience to their Consciences and it is not at all irational to conclude that some Men may have had a larger Share than others of that Knowledge of the Deity which is to beacquir'd by the Dictates of Conscience and which may be justly called  Inspiration  And  that  System is undoubtedly the most probable to be truly revealed that is most agreeable to that sacred Impulse And that the Christian System is so is allowed by our opposite Essay when it says  it contains a System of Morality truly just and noble  Thus Reason convinces us that being in itself so liable to Error it is rational for us to believe in the Christian System of Religion notwithstanding there may be ever so many apparent Absurdities attending it For after all our Enquiries we are obliged to own  The Ways of Heaven are dark and intricate  Puzzled in Mazes and perplex'd in Errors  Our Understanding traces them in vain  Lost and bewilder'd in the fruitless Search  Nor sees with how much Art the Windings run  Nor where the  regular Confusion  ends  FINIS
