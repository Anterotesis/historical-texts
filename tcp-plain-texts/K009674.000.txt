 A brief State of the Question Between the Printed and Painted CALLICOES AND THE Woollen and Silk MANUFACTURE As far as it Relates to the Wearing and Using of Printed and Painted CALLICOES in  GreatBritain  LONDON  Printed for W BOREHAM at the  Angel  in  PaternosterRow    INTRODUCTION  _WHEN Men mistake in one Thing 'tis very usual to have the World think they mistake in every Thing and 'tis an easy thing to find a Stone to throw at a Dog  Had the poor  Weavers  who I am now to speak of brought their Complaints against the exorbitant Wearing of  Callicoes  in a regular and justifiable Manner and before the proper Judges of those Things as their Conduct could not have been reproach'd so the Grievance which now suffers by their mistake would perhaps have met with more Friends  But wise and impartial Men will learn to distinguish between the Justice of a Cause and the Mistakes of the Managers of it between  the Reason of the Complaint and the disor derly manner of Complaining And this is all we shall have occasion to say of the poor mistaken tumultuous  Weavers  leaving them to the Clemency and Compassion of the Government whom they have offended but recommending the Grievance under which they groan to the serious Consideration of those in whose Power it is to redress it  That the  Weavers  suffer under the general Calamity of Trade that they and even the whole Manufacturing part of the Nation are oppress'd by the exorbitant growth of clandestine Trade and the unreasonable pouring in of  EastIndia  Wrought Goods upon us This will admit of no Debate at least none that can be supported by Reason What little can be said for it is so easily confuted and expos'd and has so often been fully answer'd that little will be wanting now But according to my Title to state the Case clearly and impartially between Woollen and Silk Goods made at Home  and the Callicoes and Wrought Silks printed here or clandestinely imported from Abroad  In order to enter upon this Affair with all possible Clearness and Plainness and if we can to strike at the Root of the Mischiefs we complain of I shall first lay down some general Propositions as Fundamentals in this Question of Trade obliging my self to give such Evidence for the proof of them as shall take away all possible Pretences to deny the Fact and this I do at first that we may have no stum bling at the Threshold no cavelling at the Terms or shuffling off the Question from one thing to another but that as I may talk to Men of Business I may talk likewise to their Understanding and Conviction My Propositions are  That the Woollen and Silk Manufactures of this Kingdom being the Staple of our Trade and the most considerable and assential part of our Wealth the Fund for our Exportation the Support of our Navigation and  the only Means we have for the Employing and Sunsisting our Poor it is therefore the common Interest of the whole Kingdom to discourage every other Manufacture whether foreign or assum'd so far as those Manufactures are ruinous to and inconsistent with the Prosperity of the said  British  Manufactures of Wool and Silk  That the Wearing and Using Printed or Painted Callicoes as they are now almost universally worn and used in  GreatBritain  is ruinous to and inconsistent with the Prosperity of our  English  Manufactures as well those of Wool as those of Silk  That the total prohibiting the Wearing and using of Printed and Painted Callicoes in  GreatBritain  is not ruinous to or inconsistent with the Prosperity of the  East India  Trade or  to put it into an Affirmative that may be more capable of Evidence  the  EastIndia  Trade may and would remain in a very  thriving and flourishing Condition and be carry'd on to the Profit and Advantage of the Adventurers tho all the Subjects of  GreatBritain  and of  Ireland  were effectually limitted from and prohibited the wearing and using of Printed and Painted Callicoes  That the Printed and Painted Callicoes now worn and used in  GreatBritain  come under four Denominaitons  ALL pernicious and destructive  to our Trade  viz  such as being inported by the  Dutch  are either printed in the  Indies  or in  Holland  and clandestinely run on Shoar here in spite of former Prohibitions  OR  such as being imported here by our own  EastIndia  Company and prohibited to be worn because printed in  India  are pretended to be exported but are privately run on Shoar again and sold  OR  such as being printed here are entered and ship'd for Exportatian in order to dram back the Duties on the Stamps but are re landed and sold here and lastly such as are Printed here  and legally worn and used and under the  Colour of which ALL  the other Frauds are practis d and conceal'd  That this clandestine Importation and Relanding of Printed and Painted Callicoes is no way to be prevented neither is it in the reach of the Wit and Power of Man to put a stop to it by any other Means but by effectually preventing and prohibiting the wearing and use of them  I have some other essential Propositions in Trade which will come in course to be laid down for the carrying on this Argument as we proceed in the Consideration of these but I shall reserve them  in petto  till I see whether the Age is weak enough to struggle with things so selfevident as these and till I see what it is can be offer'd  if any thing shall be mustred up  against these five  A brief State of the Question Between the PRINTED and PAINTED CALLICOES AND THE Woollen and Silk Manufacture  c  _THAT the IMPORTATION of Wrought Silks and Printed Callicoes from the  EastIndies  and allowing the use of them here when imported has all along been found prejudicial to the Home Consumption of our Woollen and Silk Manufactures in  GreatBritan  needs no other Proof than the late Acts of Parliament which were obtain'd in  Consequence of the general Application of the  Manufacturers  as well Masters as Workmen through the whole Kingdom to prohibit and limit their Consumption  In doing this the Parliament whose Wisdom and Justice was very conspicuous in that very Case entred into the true Merits of the Cause search'd it to the bottom and weigh'd the Allegations on every side The Members were neither clamour'd into it by the  Weavers  byafs'd to it by Parties or hurry'd into it by the multitude of Petitions from the Counties and Corporations they represented but the Weight of the Cause supported it self the Nature of the Thing pleaded it and their own wellweigh'd Reason importun'd them to it The thing was selfevident the Humor of the People  as too often is the Fate of Nations  seem'd at that time possess'd against their Interest and being hurry'd down the Stream  of their Fancy they ran headlong into the greatest Neglect and Contempt of the Growth and Manufactures of their own Country and People and embrac'd with a Violence in their Temper not to be resisted the Silks and Callicoes of  India  in a manner even ridiculous to themselves as well as fatal to their Interest  The Extravagance of that Time cannot be so entirely forgot as that we should not reflect how the Ladies converted their Carpets and Quilts into Gowns and Petticoats and made the broad and uncouth Bordures of the former serve instead of the rich Laces and Embroideries they were used to wear and dress more like the MerryAndrews of  Bartholomew  Fair than like the Ladies and Wives of a Trading People  The Consequence was what any one might thave foreseen would be  viz  the Ruin of our Manufactures the stagnating  of our Trade the stop of Employment and the starving our Poor The Cry was universal not the  SpittleFields  Weavers only selt it the Calamity was general and the Complaint came from every Corner of the Nation  As all Mischiefs in their Exorbitance tend naturally to their own Cure so it was hear seeing the thing was fatal in it self to our Trade it was our Felicity that it run on to such Extremes as allarm'd the whole Kingdom for this awaken'd the Parliament to its Redress Such we cannot but hope will be the Case again for like Causes generally produce like Effects  The Proceedings of the Legislature might pass with us all for Reason in a Case of much more Consequence than this but we have yet more powerful Auxiliaries to bring in Aid of the Case before us I'll insist upon two only  st  The Pattern of our  Neighbours  dly  The Success of our own Prohibitions I begin with the last  What the Parliament did in the Cafe I just now mentioned was abundantly justify'd in the Success What can be more encouraging to apply the same way seeing the Cafe is the same  No sooner was the Flux of foreign Manufactures stopp'd and the  EastIndia  Goods prohibited but the Trade reviv'd the Face of Things chang'd Business and Plenty succeeded to want of Employment and want of Bread the Numbers of Poor flocking to the Manufactures for Employment and the Encrease of the Consumption of our Manufactures reviv'd the whole Nation Nothing could be a stronger and more convincing Evidence of what had been alledg'd  viz  that the so general wearing and using  East India  printed Callicoes c had been the Ruin of our Trade had put a  stop to the Employment of the Weavers and in a word had  starv'd our Poor  I shall come to this again in its Place  I come in the next place to the Example of our Neighbours and particularly the  French  a Nation but too wife in the most proper Methods for erecting and encouraging Manufactures of which there are such Testimonies given in the Administration of Monsieur  Colbert  who was justly call'd  The Father of the  French  Manufactures  as we have felt the Consequences of in Trade for many Years past  The  French EastIndia  Company was Establish'd by the enterprising  Genius  of the said Monsieur  Colbert  in the Year and the Edict pass'd the  th of  August  settling all their Privileges for Years and they begun with great Advantages tho' they had not Success occasioned by their own Mismanagement However the King  of  France  finding the using and wearing of  India  wrought Silks Cottons and Callicoes painted and printed whether in  India  or at Home began to encroach upon the Manufactures of his Subjects as well Silk as Wool and foreseeing that it would be the Ruin of both for which he thought himself oblig'd to preserve the utmost Concern as being the Fundamental of the Riches of his Kingdom he effectually prohibited the Wearing and Use of them whether printed at Home or Abroad among his Subjects by an Edict in the Year and under very severe Penalties And the late King of  France  being mov'd by his Council of Trade from time to time by several subsequent Edicts confirm'd those Prohibitions adding farther Penalties more severe than before for enforcing the Execution By all which it appears of what Consequence this Matter was thought to be for the preserving the Manufactures of his own Dominions  The Government of  France  proceeding still upon the same Maxims of a just Policy in Trade continue as Tenacious of their former Care for their own Manufactures as ever And this appears by the Provision made by subsequent Edicts to continue the same Prohibitions in the strictest manner of all such  EastIndia  Goods as are hurtful to their Manufactures of which the following is a flaming Instance  viz  We all know that the present Government has united their old  EastIndia  Company to their new  WestIndia  Company and what great Advances of Credit that Union has made in  France  yet so far is the present Government from neglecting their own Manufactures by forgetting to prohibit the Use of the Callicoes  c  which the said Company may import and so far are they from imagining that the said Company should not flourish and thrive notwithstanding the Prohibition of those Goods tho' so considerable a Branch of their Importation that  those Prohibitions are all expresly renew'd repeated and confirm'd by the Edict of Reunion as appears by the IXth and Xth Articles of the Grant to the said new Establish'd Company as follows  Artic  IX 'We permit the said Company to import from the Countries within their Grant all sorts of Stuffs of pure Silk and of Silk and Cotton mix'd with Gold and Silver Bark of Trees and Callicoes dy'd painted and strip'd We require that the said Merchandizes prohibited in this Kingdom may not be sold but on express Conditions of being exported to foreign Parts and that for this End they may be laid up in the WareHouses of our FarmerGenerals under two Keys of which the FarmerGeneral or his Deputies shall keep one and the Directors of the Company or their Substitutes the other and that all other necessary Precautions be taken to hinder the Sale of the  said Merchandize for Domestick Consumption'  Artic  X 'The said Company may also import from the Countries within their Grant all forts of White Callicoes Raw Silks Coffee Drugs Spices Metals and other Things except those prohibited by the preceeding Article paying the Duties which are actually paid by the  India  Company according to the Edicts Declarations Arrets and Regulations of the Kings our Predecessors'  Here we see the very Thing done in  France  which we want here and for the very same Reasons for which we stand so much in need of it here which Reasons we cannot doubt will subsist with the same Force here as there the Foundations of Foreign Import Home Manufactures being the same and especially because he cannot doubt but that a  British  Parliament will appear inspir'd with all the  just Principles of Care and Concern for the Good of our People and the Prosperity of our Trade as the Councils of the late King of  France  could be for his Subjects  But I cannot forbear taking Notice here how much stronger the Argument is on our Side for the doing this now than it ever was before even for this particular Reason  viz  Because the  French  have upon their new Establishment continued their Prohibitions I explain my self thus  The  French  have not only reestablish'd the  Trade  of  India  but they have put it into Hands which are not like to neglect it run in Debt in the  Indies  or sell the Liberty of Trade to others but they who are now entrusted with the Privilege know very well how to make use of it and want no Stock to carry it on And as they are capable both in Knowledge of the Business and Stock for the managing of it so they appear  resolute to proceed immediately upon it and we are told they have already taken up four large Ships for the carrying on the Trade and that they talk of taking up several more The  Flemmings  under the Inperial Commission or Charter are not only doing the same but are actually embark'd in the  EastIndia  Trade have several Ships now Abroad and one great Ship just arriv'd from  India  at  Ostend  being the second that they have received since their entring upon that Trade And we are likewise told that the Government of the  Austrian Netherlands  has already resolv'd on the prohibiting the Consumption of Printed Painted Callicoes among them and that they will be publickly prohibited there as they are in  France  Let any impartial Person then judge whether we have not just Reason to be allarm'd at these Measures while we lie open to a smuggling Trade so generally carried on thro' this whole Kingdom and  so impossible now to be prevented Whither must the vast Quantities of Callicoes which thess two new  EastIndia  Companies will import I say Whither must they go Whither but to  England  and  Scotland  and  Ireland  where the People are so fond of them and where it is so easy to get them on Shore  Our  EastIndia  Company has already shew'd themselves apprehensive of Success of the new Establish'd Imperial Company in  Flanders  nor can they be justly unconcern'd at the setting up a Company in  France  upon so potent a Stock as that of Millions But what then have we not to fear for our Woollen and Silk Manufactures which are so oppress'd already with clandestine Importations of Silks and Callicoes from Abroad as well as Printing them at Home and when the  French  will not fail to bring in Quantities equal to the Opportunities which they have to  ind them  We may appeal for this to any one that is acquainted on those Shores of  England  which lie nearest to  France  are not  French  Brandies  French  Wines and  French  Silks to be had almost in as great Plenty in our PortTowns on that side of the Country as in some Parts of  France  it self and will it not be the same thing with  India  Goods Can  Rumney Marsh  want  French  Callicoes where all  French  Goods are  as it were  as familiar to them as in  France  Can those People that know how to carry off whole Freights of Wool the most bulky of all Merchandize be ignorant to take on Shoar  French  Callicoes  French  Wrought Silks  French EastIndia  Goods of all Kinds It cannot be doubted but when the  French  come to have a Quantity of Callicoes always by them and no consumption for them at Home they will find Ways and Means to croud them in upon us with much more Ease than they do now their Wines and Brandies What the Consequence of this will be to our Woollen  and Silk Manufactures is very plain They must be destroy'd nothing can prevent it  These Things serve to let us see that the present Debate is not the Concern of a few People in  SpittleFields  only tho' their Poverty and Distress happens to be nearest our View at this time as their Complaints have been loudest But in a word the whole Body is effected the whole Interest of our Woollen and Silk Manufactures throughout the Kingdom is concern'd in it I mean as to those Goods which concern our Wearing Apparel and Furniture which is the Bulk of our Manufactures nay the  EastIndia  Company themselves are concern'd in it and I believe it might be very easy to prove by a just Calculation that if these Companies now set up in  France  and  Flanders  prosper and thrive as it is more than probable they will the  EastIndia  Company of  GreatBritain  will suffer more by their  Importing their Callicoes here and thereby sharing the Trade with them or rather taking it from them then they will by the general putting a stop upon the Consumption and thereby checking the Foreigners in their beginning so that upon the whole of the two the Prohibition seems to me to be no Evil at all but rather an Advantage to them  It was without question an unaccountable Mistake in those who sollicited the first Prohibition of  India  printed Callicoes that they contented themselves with prohibiting the Use of Callicoes printed Abroad but did not insist upon prohibiting the Wearing and Use of those printed at Home as Things in themselves equally ruinous to our Manufactures they had not then left the Door open to the Printing and Painting them in  England  a Trade then scarce known under colour of which all sorts of Callicoes wheresoever printed have been worn here and  Foreigners thereby encouraged to pour them in upon us by the Arts of clandestine Trade and our People impose upon us by relanding their own in which by the way the known and wilful Perjury that attends it is one of the least Things in our Consideration  But now the Work is to be done over again with this Difficulty in the Difference  viz  that now we have the Pretences of the  Callicoe Printers  to struggle with their calling the Callicoes a Manufacture because Painted and Printed here tho' these are in themselves meer Trifles like that of the Numbers of Families employ'd in Printing  c  I say Trifles when compar'd with the Manufactures themselves which we plead for and the Numbers of Families and People maintain'd by and employ'd in them of which I believe I am not arrogant when I say it is ridiculous to talk of any Proportion  The Work has also another Difficulty in  its way or rather a pretended Difficulty that is to say I foresee that some People intend to call this a Difficulty I mean the Fund form'd upon the Stamps on Callicoes appropriated perhaps to such or such Uses or as Security for such and such Loans But as all those Funds are to our great Satisfaction made redeemable by Parliament we have no more to do but to convince our Representatives of the Necessity of redeeming them and leave the House which is the in exhaustible Fund of Funds to their own Methods for finding an equivalent Security to the Satisfaction of the Lenders and yet even in this Point when the House shall legitimate such an Attempt something may be said farther  Difficulties therefore are no Discouragement where absolute Neccessity is the Motive The Thing carries an apparent Necessity in it it must be remedied or our Trade must be Ruin'd our Manufactures be at an  End and our poor not sent a Begging only but indeed be Starv'd And here were it any thing to the Purpose I could spend some time in Exclamation at the preposterous unthinking Humour of our People who upon all Occasions run directly counter to their Interest as a Trading Nation in so visible and so evident a manner as this of wearing Printed Callicoes or at least wearing them so as to make it an universal Mode We often see Clothiers DruggetMakers Sergemakers Stuffmakers  c  dress themselves and their Families in the Cloth or Druggets or Serges or Stuffs they make and tho' they may not be so very like their Neighbours they will give this ready Answer  viz  '  Tis my own Trade 'tis my own Manufacture  And the Answer is allow'd to be very rersonable Why should it not be a National Answer as well as a Family Answer Why should not an  English  Man or an  English  Lady reject foreign and destructive  Gewgaws    and chusing to wear the Woollen and Silk of our own Product and Manufacture give this for a Reason for it  Tis our own Trade 'tis our own Manufacture  Let us go to the  Indians  and the  Chineses  for Instruction as  Solamon  sends the Sluggard to the Ant Are they prevaild with to lay by their own Manufactures for any of Ours No 'tis evident we are so far from being able to place any of our Manufactures among them that they despise the Proposal and refuse to sell those Goods which we have  so little need of  but for that ready Money which we have  so little need to part with  But this is a large Field I refer it to the Time when the Battle shall be more closely join'd then we may find time to talk more feelingly of the Folly of carrying Money to the  Indies  to buy that which we ought rather to give Money to be without  But I return to the  Indians  who as uncapable  as they may be to judge of their National Interests are yet wiser in this part by the Strength of meer Nature than we are who pretend to so much Knowledge for they wear their own Manufactures not can we bring them to alter the manner of their Cloathing any more than the Matter of it  Some have alledg'd for a Reason of this the Climate in the  Indies  being suited to the Manufactures they make and that nothing can be so light so clean so pleasant in such hot Countries as the Callicoes and Silks of their own making But we might very well answer this by giving the Patterns of our fine Stuffs some of which as well as the manner of wearing them in hot Countries are much Cooler and much more suited to the Heat of the warmest Climate than the uncouth Fassions great Sleeves and pleated Gowns of the  Indians  who even load themselves rather than dress themselves with their Callicoes and other Manufactures  of their own Make Any Traveller might be left to judge of this who has seen the  Spaniards  at  Peru  at  Lima  at  Panama Carthagena  and suchlike hot Places where they dress much cooler and lighter in  British  and  French  Stuffs and Cloth nay even in  English  Black Bayes than the  Indians  on the Coast of  Malabar  and  Coromandel  or in the Bay of  Bengale  do in their Silks and Callicoes but Nature dictates to these Nations to cultivate their own Produce to consume their own Manufacture and encourage their own Commerce And Nature would dictate the same thing to us if we did not obstinately put out Nature's Eyes and act against Nature in the pursuit of the most untractable part of our Faculties I mean Humour and Fancy  Certainly if we were free from this TradeFrenzy and were to act by the Dictates of Common Sense we should reflect that the Woollen Manufacture is the Staple of our  ginal Fountain of our Wealth and as I said in my  Introduction  it is  the most essential part of the Riches of the Rich and the principal Means we have for the employing our Poor  Many things might be said to prove and some to illustrate whatever is contain'd in these Generals concerning our WoollenManufacture but I am loath to suppose my self talking to any People so ignorant as not to know it or so partial as not to acknowledge it If I can meet with any  Englishman  so weak as to dispute it I undertake at Demand to expose them and prove my Proposition both at once  The Premises then being granted my Inference is as just namely  that it is the common Interest of the whole Kingdom to discourage every other Manufacture so far as those Manufactures ruinous  to  and inconsistent  with  the Prosperity of  our Own  The late King of  France  who so well understood  the Interest of his Subjects in Trade is a standing Authority for this very thing All the Edicts publish'd in  France  on this Subject such as in the Year and in and in prohibiting the Printing and Painting of Callicoes in  France  and the selling Callicoes Printed or Painted in  India  when Imported into  France  are fortified with this Reason as sufficient to justify their Government in the said Prohibition viz  that they were prejudicial to the Manufactures of Wooll and Silk already establisbed in  France  And there are two things in those Edicts of the King of  France  which are very remarkable and which I reserve for farther Explanation if I find occasion to speak in this Cause hereaster I say two things are very remarkable in the King of  France  's Prohibitions and Limitation of his  EastIndia  Company's Trade which stand as Precedents for our Practice the same Reasons  being much more strong and forcible at this time in our Circumstances than they could then be in  France  First  That in the Edict or Arret prohibiting or forbidding the Painting Printing of Callicoes in  France  is also included a strict Prohibition of the Painting and Printing any kind of Linen Cloath of Hemp or Flax tho' such Linen was the Growth and Manufacture of his own Kingdom  Secondly  That in his Limitation of the importations of the  EastIndia  Company there is this Clause That whereas the Company were allow'd to import some certain Wrought Silks named in the Edict to the value of Livers a Year so  first  they were oblig'd to bring in no more and  secondly  they were oblig'd in consideration of that Liberty only I say they were obliged to export to the  Indies  the  value of Livers a Year in Goods of the Growth and Manufactures of  France  And even this Condition did not continue long for the Council of Trade there considering that the consumption of the Manufactures was by no means an Equivalent for the Injury those Silks  c  tho' but to the value of Livers a Year did to the Manufactures of  France  that Grant was also revok'd and the Goods entirely prohibited under the most rigorous Penalties as they continue to be this Day  These two Clauses are of such moment in the Case before us and dictate so clearly not only what we have to seek and what to complain of with respect to our Maunfactures and to our  EastIndia  Company but also the Reasons of it that I cannot but think it very much for the Publick Service to publish the sevral Edicts in which these Clauses and the Reason and Causes  given for them are contain'd accordingly they are plac'd in the Close of this Work  Thus I have touch'd at the Heads of this Matter and have pass'd them over without other Enlargments then such as the present Occasion makes necessary This Essay  for it is no more  is but a Specimen of the Controversy every one of these Heads having necessary Explanations attending them and long debated Points of Commerce to speak to in order to set the whole Affair in a clear Light all which it may be to the purpose to enlarge upon hereaster  CONCLUSION  In the mean time I cannot dismiss this Affair without turning a little to the Trading part of Mankind and especially the Dealers in the Woollen Manufactures in this Nation 'Tis not a little strange to observe  how unconcern'd we sit and seem to enjoy our selves in a perfect composure of Mind and a most inimitable Tranquility when our general Commerce by which we all subsist langushes and as it were expires in our sight At Home foreign Manufactures encroach upon us Abroad they are preparing new Projects to attack us and as they seem united to Undo us so I must say we seem unanimous in the Resolution of being Undone  How can we sit still and see the Bread thus taken out of our labouring Peoples Mouths even by those very Men who ought to be equally concern'd with us to prevent it The Wearing and Use of Callicoes is evidently the Ruin of our Manufactures If we can distinguish between the Manufactures and the Manufacturers if the Empolyment can be lost and the Workmen not suffer if the Trade can die and the Tradesmen live then I have no Foundation  for my Discourse no Reason for this Expostulation  Nay if this was a particular Article of Trade only if a few Families were to be ruin'd of this or that particular Employment only and the main of our People not be effected with it we might be silent and the Opposers might say we made more Noise of it than there was occasion for  But since the Evil is general and the Mischiefs which attend it are so spreading that the whole Nation is more or less effected from the Gentleman of the greatest Quality and Estate to the meanest Woolcumber and that we are inevitably to feel the Consequences of it How can we I say sit unconcern'd and see out Families impoverish'd and the Foundation laid for the Ruin of our Posterity and yet take no Notice of it It is certainly our Concern in a more particular manner to APPEAR not in Arms not  in Mobs and Tumults that neither is a lawful Way of Appearing nor would it give the least Aid in the Matter Trade is the Daughter of Peace and draws its principal Nourishment from the publick Tranquillity No Men in their Senses can propose raising Tumults and Riots for the promoting Trade neither is it the way to engage the Government the Parliament or the Ministry to redress our Grievances in Trade Such violent Ways only arm Power against us and engage Governors to be our Enemies My Arguments all run another Way and if I mistake not have ten times more Force in them with wise Governments than all the Clamours of a Rabble can suppose to have  I move you first to see the Mischief To that end I set it in a clear Light prove the Fact shew you the slow degrees by which the Poison works how insensibly it grows upon you and yet how sensibly some  parts of Trade feel it already and how certainly all other parts will be effected by it  I move you then to put your Hands to all Legal Preventions I aim at no other I move you to joyn in all just Representations both of the Mischief and the Remedy to those in whose Power it is to relieve you I mean your ParliamentMen your Representatives who as they are most of them chosen by the several Trading Corporations of  England  may be more particularly call'd the Representatives of the TradingPart of the Nation  These are the profest Physicians of all our Trading Maladies I may say 'tis their Business to heal you and I am sure it is in their Power represent it to them in Parliament and represent it to them out of Parliament let them come up to Parliament fairly appris'd of the Case fully convine'd of the Justice of your Complaints and the absolute Necessity there is of relieving you Let  them see it make them Witnesses in the Countries where they live of the Decay of the Manufactures of the Abatement made upon the Poor in their Wages of the Numbers of Poor that desert and run from one Work to another for want of Employment Shew them the Rolls of your Parishes which I am satisfy'd will discover how many Families more than ever are listed among your Pensioners for whom Parish Provision is necessarily made for want of their getting Bread by the Works they were wont to be employ'd in shew them the languishing Circumstances of the People as  the Effect  and then lay before them the languishing Circumstances of the Trade as the Cause then they will come up to Parliament convinc'd of your Distresses fully prepar'd to receive your Petitions and fill'd with Compassionate Thoughts for your Redress  I must consess this seems to me to be the most proper Method to spirit the approaching  Assembly of Parliament with Sentiments of Pity for their County and with a just Knowledge of the Reallity of and Reason for the Complaints you make and if I might be allow'd to suppose that these Sheets shall any where come to the Hands of the particular Members in the Manufacturing Counties and Corporations for which they serve I would with all possible Humility but also with the utmost Importunity petition them to look a little into the State of the Manufactures in their respective Countries where they live  It is without doubt the just Concern of our Representatives to study the Interest and the Circumstances of the People who they represent If these Gentlemen please but to look round them they must of Necessity see that the Manufactures decline that Trade languishes and the Poor stretch our their Hands to them for Help They must needs also see the Causes of it even at  their own Doors while they cannot but see a wilfullypossess'd Nation dress'd up in the Manufactures of Foreigners and despising the Workmanship of their own People Madly sending their Money to  India  and  China  to feed and support Heathens and Savages and neglecting nay I may say Rejecting the Manufactures of their own Country tho' they see the poor Families starving for want of Work  I press the People in the Countries to lay open their Case before their Representatives and convince them of the melancholly Circumstances they are in by the Decay of Trade and the Stop of their Manufactures and give them a clear View of the Nature of the Grievance and whence it proceeds and there is no room to doubt but the Members would be affected with it as well as other Men  'Tis from the same Principle that I move  the Gentlemen themselves to enquire into the Case and make themselves fully Masters of both the Fact and the Reason of it After which I would not suffer it to be nam'd as a Doubt but that the natural Concern every Member of Parliament must have for the Prosperity of the People he represents will move him effectually to apply himself in Parliament to the Remedy  'Tis a great Mistake to suggest that  SpittleFields  alone Complains or has cause to Complain tho' as I said before the Manufacturers there feel the Burthen sooner but all the Country and almost all the Branches of the Woollen and Silk Manufactures feel it And 'tis easy to shew why the Town Workmen feel the stop of Trade sooner than the Country Workmen The Case is this  The Clothiers and Drugget or Stuffmakers in the Country who are the head Managers of the Woollen Manufactures are  generally Men of Substance and good Stocks they have often whole Towns and Villages employ'd in their particular Works and tho' they do feel a stop of the Trade at Markets they do not so immediately put a stop to their works but they must keep their Markets and make their Circuits to take in the Yarn and put out the Wool or their Neighbours will break in upon them their Spinners will seek Work in other Hands and perhaps not be gotten again when they may want them  Thus they go on a great while tho' the Goods when made do not sell 'till  BlackwellHall  lies piled up to the Roof with Goods and the WholesaleMen and Factors WareHouses are throng'd with them nay even then they go on and are forc'd to draw upon the Factors and Wholesale Dealers for the Money whether the Goods sell or no The Factors again are sometimes forced to sell them to Mony'dMen under the Price and perhaps to Loss nay and even sometimes to pawn or pledge them for Money  in hopes of a Market to come and still with the Money answer'd by those Bills the Clothier in the Country goes on as long as he can get Credit for a Bag of Wool to Work or a Penny of Money to pay his VVorkmen And this causes the Country Poor not to feel the Check and Decays of their Trade so soon as the Town Workmen But then we must take this with us as we go  viz  that when the Trade droops so long together and the Country Manufacturer or Clothier is forced to stop 'tis more fatal to the Poor  as above  for then as they are long before they stop so they are longer before they recover and the Poor are as it were entirely destitute for a great while  But in  SpittleFields  the Case alters here the Manufacturers I mean the Masters are near the Market They do not put out the Wool to Spinning but generally buy it in the Yarn As soon is the Market stops they stop if they cannot sell their Work they immediately knock off their Looms and the  Journeymen as immediately starve and want Work Thus as Distempers near the Heart or in the Vital Parts are sooner and more sensibly felt than in the less Noble Parts of the Body so the Disease of Trade the Decay and Stop of Sale is most sensibly and sooner felt here than in the Country and therefore Here the Complaint is first made and loudest  But this on the other hand testifies to us that if it be not provided for forwith if some present Remedy be not apply'd to it the spreading malignity will soon extend it self and the most extream Part will then feel it And what's the Consequence but that then the Complaint will come up louder and be more uneasy to us  All these things urge us if possible to apply some speedy some immediate Remedy to the Evil What that Remedy is and what alone can cure us I refer to the Season  of it the present Business is to lay down the Fundamental  viz  shew the Disease awaken the Nation open their Eyes to the Consequences of it and guide them in their Applications to the proper Persons who alone can take it in hand and that is  as above  the Parliament  Certainly if the Members of Parliament in the several Countries would but enquire a little into the Particulars now they are at leisure they would come up big with a Desire to set their helping hand to it they would come up fill'd with Resentment at those who have been Instruments to ruin the flourishing Trade of their Country and nothing could influence them against the humble proposals that may be made to them for restoring the Trade and Prosperity of the Kingdom  It is suggested that all Applications of this King will meet with a powerfull Opposition  and that the Manufacturers however numerous they are will not find Friends enough to carry their Point against the Wearing and Using the Printed Callicoes  For my part I cannot be of this Opinion It is true I have not  told Noses  as they call it or cast up the Strength on either side or examin'd who shall be the Friends or who the Enemnies of the VVeavers Petitions but this I venture to say that as I have prov'd the Grievance is National this I think will follow that none of the Nation's Friends can be Enemies to the Proposals for a Remedy It is our Satisfaction that this is no Party Cause unless any one should vilely insinuate that there is a Party that would not have the Manufactures thrive or would have the Poor starv'd and perish and I cannot have such ill Notions of any Man as to think Party can carry them that length Trade is a perfect Neuter in all our unhappy Strife Spinning and Weaving are neither  Whig  or  Tory  but the great Articles by which we live by which the consumption of our Produce is carry'd on and by which the Poor are subsisted who without it would in a word eat us up all  If this Cause Meets with Enemies if any one Man can be found in  Britan  who would not have us leave off Painted Feathers and stick to our own Manufactures I say if one Man can be found so prepossess'd it must be either a Man perfectly ignorant in Matters of Trade and so not worth talking to or it must be some Callicoe Printer or his Employer and Dependant who finding his Account in the Mischief acts upon the corrupt Principle of being willing to get Money tho' at the Expence of the Ruin of his Country something like the wretched Sexton of  Cripplegate  in the Year who being employ'd at the  Pestbouse  near  Oldstreet  would have had the  Plague  continue  that his Fees might not abate but that he might have People enough to Bury  But let us not fright our selves with the imaginary Notion of Enemies and a strong Opposition  Nil Desperandum  let us take but true Measures setting the Fact in a clear light and convincing our Representatives in a peaceable but effectual manner of the Weight of the Case and how justly they are concern'd as Representatives to espouse the Trading Interest of their Country I can never imagine that any Cabals of Drapers  EastIndia  Men Brokers and Jobbers shall be able to byass the Members of a  British  Parliament against it or to blind their Eyes in a Case so clear as this that wearing a foreign Manufacture and despising our own is the most preposterous tho' the most certain Method of straving us all that can possibly be invented  Here follows the two Clauses in two several Arrets of the  French  King's Council mentioned in this Work  In the Arret of  December  after other Clauses as follows  His Majesty ordains That the Arret and Regulations formerly made prohibiting the Consumption and Wearing of Painted Callicoes aforesaid shall be executed according to theit full Tenor and Form and according to the aforesaid Arret of the th of  May  and has prohibited and does hereby prohibit all Persons of what Quality or Condition soever to Print or Paint or cause to be Printed or Painted any Silks or all Callicoes whatsoever and all Linen Cloth or Cloth made of Flax or Hemp new or old or to sell or expose the same to Sale on pain of Confiscation and Livres Fine And his Majesty likewise ordains That the Moulds or other Instruments made use of for the Printing or Painting the said Linen shall be broken and defaced And to this Purpose there shall be an exact Search made through all Places in the City of  Paris  by the LieutenantGeneral of the Polity and in other Provinces by the Intendants and Commissaries respectively whom his Majesty hereby requires to put the said Arret in Execution  The other Clause is from an Arret of  July  whereas after other Clauses it is expresly said THUS  His Majesty has permitted and does hereby permit the  EastIndia  Company according to an Arret of Council of  Jan  to bring from the  Indies  every Year Painted Callicoes and Stuffs to the Value of Livres on Condition the said Company shall export to the  Indies  every Year as is likewise ordain'd by the said Arret the Value of Livres every Year in Goods of the Growth and Manufacture of  France  which said Callicoes nevertheless shall be sent into foreign Parts on account of the Company and not sold to any of the Merchants of  France  And if the Company brings any greater Quantity than is limited as above they shall be Confiscated and Burnt  His Majesty also strictly forbidding all Persons of Quality or Condition soever to make any Garments or HousholdStuff of the said Painted Callicoes or Stuffs and to all Taylors and Upholders to have any thing made of the same in their keeping on the pain of Livres Fine  c  Errata
