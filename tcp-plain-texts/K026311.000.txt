resignation in my distressesDoth my belief in his good∣ness excite me to love himAnd is my belief of his continual presence a check on the badness of my thoughts words and actions  If my faith in God produce these ef∣fects have I such a sense of my depen∣dence on him that I pray daily to him Do I go regularly to church to pray to him in public as well as in private and do I remember what I hear and endeavour to live up to it  II As I believe the holy scriptures to be the word of God do I read them with an intention to improve my heart and obey the precepts which I find in them  Do I learn from them in the first place to abstain from every wickedness If I have been led into sin do I imme∣diately repent of it and not suffer it to become habitual  Do I likewise learn from the holy

live as a christian ought to do assist me by thy blessed Spirit in ob∣taining that stedfast faith in Thee that may govern all my actionsthat I may stand in fear of offending Thee from the considera∣tion of thy power and justicethat I may  ove and obey Thee from the persuasion of thy goodnessand that I may put my trust  n Thee and bear with patience every thing that befalls me from a full assurance of thy wisdom that having thus endeavoured through faith in Thee to perform my duty in this world I may be removed in thy good time to a better through the merits and atonement of Jesus Christ our Saviour Amen  O LORD God in whom I live and move and have my being accept my praise and thanksgiving for all thy mercies to me from the first moment of my birth to this time Pardon all my past offences and grant that I my seek my happiness only in obeying Thee through Jesus Christ our Lord Amen  EXPLANATION  OF THE FOREGOING PAPER  I  Of Faith  Or what a Christian should BELIEVE  Question  You are required you see both to  believe  and  live  as a christian ought to do what are you then required first to  believe  Answer  I must believe in Godthat he is a Being of  infinite justice power wis∣dom  and  goodness  Q  When you say you believe God is a Being of  infinite justice  what do you mean  A  I mean that God is just to all his crea∣tures and particularly that he will reward and punish us in the next world according to our behaviour in this  Q  What do you mean when you say he is a Being of  infinite power  A  I mean that God can do every thing and that every thing that is done is done by him  Q  But why do you believe that when you know many things are done by men  A  Because it is through God that men are enabled to do any thing Besides God makes the stone the iron the wood and all other things which men use  Q  What do you mean when you say God is a Being of  infinite wisdom  A  I mean that God knows every thing and particularly what is best for us all  Q  And when you say God is a Being of  infinite goodness  what do you mean  A  I mean that his goodness is unbounded and that all the good we receive of every kind comes from him  Q  But you receive good sometimes from men  A  Yes▪ but God enables them to do it by putting it into their heartsby affording them opportunitiesand by giving them the means So that all the good men do may properly be said to come from God  Q  You say farther you believe that God  created  and  preserves  every thing why do you believe that God created every thing  A  Because I see every where the  marks of design  Q  What do do you mean by the  marks of design  A  I mean that when  one part answers to another  in any thing and an  end is produced  there are the  marks of design  or contrivance in that thing  Q  But you see these  marks of design  and contrivance in the works of menyou see in a house for instance the roof the door the windows and all the other parts  related  to each otherand an  end produced  by its affording a convenient shelter from the wea∣ther but you do not believe in God because you see the  marks of design  in a house  A  No but as the  marks of design  in a house shew me that it has been made by the skill and contrivance of men and not by chance so when I see superior  marks of de∣sign  in things which men cannot makeas in the sunin plantsin beastsin birdsin fishesand numberless other things I con∣clude they are created by God  Q  Tell me then what  relation  there is be∣tween the sun and the earth for instance and what  ends are produced  by it  A  The sun draws vapours or particles of water both from the sea and land just in the same way as particles of water are formed by  heat on the lid of a boiling pot These vapours which the sun draws up become clouds and are driven about by winds to different parts of the earth and when they fall in rain the  end they produce  is food for man and beastThe sun also gives light to the earth and warms it so as to make it fruitful  Q  How do you observe this  relation of parts  and  end produced  in plants  A  The root is  related  to the earth and draws nourishment from itthe stem is  re∣lated  to the root and carries that nourishment up to the flower from which the  end pro∣duced  is the seed or fruit  Q  What marks of  design  do you see in animals  A  They are all  fitted to their several sta∣tions  and the  end produced  is to fill every part of the world with living creatures all of which have their use tho we cannot find out the use of all  Q  How is the bird fitted for its station  A  It has wings to fly withit is made lightand sharppointed so as to pass easily through the air  Q  How is the fish fitted for its station  A  It has fins to swim with and when it wants to go to the top of the water or to the bottom it has a little bladder which it can  fill with air and empty as it chuses When the bladder is filled the fish is lighter than the water and rises to the top when the bladder is emptied the fish is heavier and sinks to the bottomSome fish keep con∣stantly at the bottom because they find their food there  Q  How is the mole fitted for its way of life  A  It has short broad feet with which it scrapes away the earth and as it has no business out of the ground its eyes are very small and just serve to shew it that it has lost its way when it gets into the light  Q  Thus then in the same manner every creature is fitted for the station it lives in which shews they are all created by an Al∣mighty power and not by chanceBut you say you believe God  preserves  the world as well as created it what do you mean by God's  preserving  the world  A  I mean that he keeps it in the same order in which he at first created it  Q  Why do you believe that  A  Because if God did not keep it in or∣der it would fall to decay just as a house would fall to decay if it were not kept in order It is through a belief that God pre∣serves the world that all the affairs of life are carried on We eat and drink because we  believe the life of man will be nourished by food as it always has been We plant trees▪ and sow corn because we believe they will grow as they have ever done for our use and sustenance If God did not preserve the world in its regular order corn might pro∣duce weeds  Q  You say you believe farther tha  God is  present every where  But how doe that differ from your being present every where You can be in this place and in tha  place and in many different places  A  I can only be in one place at one time but God is in all places at the  same instant o  time  Q  Why do you believe that  A  It follows from God's preserving th  world As he preserves every part of it at once he must be present in every part at onceBe∣sides if God was not in all places at once h  would order the people of one country to pray to him at one time and the people o  another country to pray to him at another But as they may pray to him all at once it i  plain he can hear them all at once  Q  You say you believe God knows  a  the thoughts and intentions of your hear  Why do you believe that  A  Because as God made me he mu  know every part about me just as a man th  makes a house must be acquainted with the inside as well as the outside and all the parts about it  II  Q  You next say you believe the  holy scriptures to be the word of God  What do you mean by the holy scriptures  A  The Bible and Testament  Q  Why are they called the word of God  A  Because holy men wrote them by God's order  Q  What do you mean when you say they contain  all things necessary to salvation  A  I mean that they contain all things neces∣sary for us to know and do in order to gain God's  avour and everlasting happiness  Q  But there are many difficulties in the scriptures both in the old and new Testa∣ment and many things which we do not un∣derstand how then can they be of use to us  A  There is enough in them which we do understand that is sufficient to lead us right  Q  But why should there be any difficulties in books meant to be of such use to us  A  In the old Testament many difficulties arise from our not considering that God acted  in a different manner in the early ages of the world and particularly towards the Jews from that in which he acts nowBesides we make difficulties ourselves by supposing that many actions are allowable because they are done by good men Whereas in fact many of these actions were never intended for our imitation Some of them were bad in them∣selves and many things tho allowed under the law of Moses are not permitted by the gospel Lastly as the Bible is the oldest book that ever was written it may be sup∣posed that many things may have become obscure and difficult through length of time  Q  But we find difficulties also in the new Testament  A  It is generally supposed there are much fewer than might have been expected from its ancient date and from the Jewish ways of speaking and Jewish customs which we find in it and which are so different from ours  Q  Give me an instance of some  way of speaking  among the Jews that is different from ours  A  Our Saviour says  He that hateth not his father and mother cannot be my disciple  but he means only that we should love God bet∣ter than we do our fathers and mothersand the Jews understood it in that sense  Again where it is said  Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated  nothing is meant but that God intended to raise the Jewish nation from Jacob  Q  What instances can you give me of difficulties arising from  Jewish customs  A  We are told that a man was let down through the tiling of a house before Jesus This would be difficult in our houses but was very easy in a Jewish house which was often only one story highhad a flat roof and sometimes a trap door through the roof into the chamber below with stairs on the outside So that nothing was easier than to carry the man to the top of the house and let him down through the roofTo such houses our Saviour alludes when he says  He that is on the housetop let him not come down into the house  And  What ye hear in the ear that preach ye from the housetop  which was the most convenient way of speaking to the people because the windows were high and latticedWhen we are told also that  new wine will burst old bottles  it is easy to con∣ceive it when we know that the Jewish bottles were made of leatherAgain we read in the story of the good Samaritan that he  pulled out twopence and gave it to the host  which appears to us a very trifling sum But the penny that passed in Judea was some∣what  more than seven pence of our money so that twopence was as much as fifteen or sixteen pence with us and as things were cheaper in Judea than they are here fifteen or sixteen pence would buy as much as four or five shillings could buy now  Q  But still the scripture may be false what reason have you for believing it is true  A  Because there were people alive when it was written who could remember the mira∣cles and other things mentioned and could compare the things done with the things that were written and if it had been found to mention things that had never been done it would not have been suffered to come down to us as trueLearned men also can even trace up the new Testament from its being mentioned in different books to the very time when it was written  III  Q  As you believe the scripture therefore to be true you believe next in Jesus Christ the son of Godand in the history of him as contained in the new Testament let me hear you repeat the history of Jesus Christ as it is drawn up in the Creed  A  I believe that he was born of the Vir∣gin Marysuffered under Pontius Pilate was crucifieddeadand buriedhe de∣scended into hellthe third day he rose again from the deadhe ascended into heaven and sitteth on the right hand of God the father Almighty from whence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead  Q  What do you mean by Christ's  de∣scending into hell  A  Only that his soul and body were sepa∣ratedthat is that he  really died Hell  means only the  grave  Q  What is the great article that you be∣lieve with regard to Jesus Christ  A  That he suffered death for the sins of mankind  Q  But how came mankind to want a Sa∣viour to suffer death for their sins  A  Because on Adam's transgression all his posterity became corrupt and subject to God's displeasure  Q  In what did Adam's transgression consist  A  In eating the forbidden fruit  Q  But does it not appear very hard that God Almighty should punish Adam so much merely for eating an apple or whatever the forbidden fruit was  A  The sin did not consist in eating the fruit but in disobeying God God placed  Adam in a state of trial as he places us but as it was before the world had any people in it his trial must have been in some very easy thing He could not be guilty of theft or envy or covetousness or bearing false wit∣ness or almost any of the crimes which are now forbidden because there were then no inhabitants in the world Nor could he prac∣tice many of the duties which men now prac∣tice He could not be charitable nor forgive injuries nor honour his father and mother And as he lived in a garden nothing could be more natural than to put his obedience to the test of refraining from a certain tree  Q  But does it not seem hard that Adam's posterity should suffer through his fault  A  It does not appear that he had any posterity at the time of the fall so that his children could not properly be said to lose what they never possessed  Q  As Christ redeemed us then from the mischiefs of the fall of Adam let me know in what way his sufferings atoned for the sins of mankind  A  It is impossible for any body to answer that question but as I believe the scripture to be true I believe in the atonement of Christ which is the plain doctrine of scrip∣ture tho I do not understand it I believe the fact tho I cannot explain it  Q  But why should not the scripture ex∣plain it  A  Because if they did we should not be able to understand them There are some things in the scriptures which relate to God and other things which relate to man  Secret things  we are told  belong unto the Lord  We may however believe these things tho we do not understand them It is enough if we have sufficient proof that the scriptures are true and that what relates to ourselves is plain and easy  Q  What then are the thoughts which the sufferings of Jesus Christ should raise in our minds  A  We should reflect with the highest gra∣titude on his great kindness in laying down his life for our sake we should think with the deepest humility on our sinful nature which occasioned it and always have in our minds how ungrateful we are if we do not leave off our sins and lead good lives which is all the return he requires  IV  Q  You say you next believe that  God will assist you with his holy spirit  what makes the assistance of God's holy spirit necessary  A  Mankind's corrupt and sinful nature since the fall of Adam The scriptures tell us we  can do no good thing without the assistance of the spirit of God  Q  If that be the case and we can do no∣thing good without the assistance of the spirit of God what good is there in any thing we can do for the spirit of God does it for us  A  We have a choice either to listen to the holy spirit of God or to the temptations of the world and our goodness depends on little more than that choice God also gives us opportunities of being good and we may im∣prove them or throw them behind us as we chuse If we improve them his holy spirit will farther assist us  Q  But what reason have you to believe the holy spirit of God will assist you or acts within you as you cannot feel it  A  My not feeling it is no more a reason for my disbelieving it than my not feeling my soul is a reason for my disbelieving I have one As the scriptures therefore assure me I shall be assisted by the holy spirit of God and as it is not in the least more difficult to believe than the union of my soul and body I believe it  V  Q  You say you next believe in  a future  state  What do you believe about a future state  A  I believe that when I die I shall not perish but shall live hereafter in a state of happiness or of misery  Q  And when you say you believe in the  resurrection of the dead  what do you mean  A  I mean that my body shall rise from the grave and be united again to my soul  Q  Do you mean that the dust into which your body will be crumbled shall be∣come again a living body  A  Yes There is no more reason for my disbelieving that God will raise my body again from the dust than that God created man at first out of dust So I believe the scripture account of bothBesides I see many things in the world like such a resur∣rection I see trees dying in winter and re∣viving in summer I see corn buried in the earth and shooting up again in the spring  Q  Do you believe it will be the same body  A  What kind of body it will be I do not know We have reason to believe from scrip∣ture that in some way it will be the same body and yet that the blessed will in some way receive glorified bodies  Q  You say farther you believe in  a last  judgment  what do you believe with regard to a last judgment  A  I believe that at the end of this world we shall be called into judgment for what we have done while we lived upon earth and that we shall be rewarded or punished as we have obeyed or disobeyed the command∣ments of God  Q  By whom shall we be judged  A  By Jesus Christ  Q  The  scriptures  no doubt speak fre∣quently of a future judgment but are there any appearances in this world which tend to confirm the scripture account  A  Yes many This world has every where the appearance of a state of trialra∣ther than of a state of full reward and punish∣ment We see many inequalities in itvir∣tue often afflictedand vice in prosperity These things in a state of trial are easily ac∣counted for but certainly shew that some fu∣ture state is to be expected when rewards and punishments shall in exact proportion be distributed  Of Practice  Or a GOOD LIFE  I  Q  Thus far relates to your  faith  or to what you  believe  but is that all that is re∣quired of a christian  A  No his  faith  is of no value if his  life  be not consistent with it His faith must govern his actions and produce good works as a good tree produces good fruit  Q  You say then you  believe  in the  justice  and  power  of God that is you  believe  he will render exact  justice  to you hereafter and treat you in the next world as you have lived in this and likewise that he has the power to reward you with the greatest happiness or pu∣nish you with the greatest miseryNow if you really  believe  these things what  effect  should they have upon you  A  They should make me  reverence God's laws and afraid of offending him  Q  You say you  believe  in the  infinite wis∣dom  of God that is that God knows every thing and particularly what is best for us all If you really do  believe  this what  effect  should it have upon you  A  It should make me  satisfied with my sta∣tion in life and give me patience and resig∣nation in all the afflictions God is pleased to lay upon me  Q  You say you  believe  in the  goodness  of God that is that all the good you receive of every kind comes from God What is the good you receive from God  A  My lifefoodraimentevery thing I have Yet as God lays no stress either on riches or poverty but considers them both as the means of trial only the great good I hope from God is the happiness of the next world in comparison with which the riches of this world are nothing  Q  In what does the happiness of the next world consist  A  We can know only what the scriptures tell us They do not explain the happiness of the next world but just inform us that it will be very great And God Almighty expects we should believe and trust in him for the completion of his promisesthat is he ex∣pects we should rely upon his word  A  If then you really believe you are in∣debted to God for all this goodness both  here and hereafter what  effect  should it have upon you  A  It should excite me to love him and to shew that love by keeping his command∣ments and feeling my chief pleasure in obey∣ing him It should lessen also my love for this world and increase my faith in the pro∣mises of the next  Q  You say farther that you  believe  God is  every where present and knows all the thoughts and intentions of your heart  If you really  believe  this what  effect  should it have upon you  A  It should be a  check on the badness of my thoughts words and actions  If a bad thought should ever come into mind I should immediately turn it out when I con∣sider that God sees it  Q  If then you truly and sincerely believe in the infinite power the wisdom and good∣ness of Godthat every thing you have or hope for comes from himthat he is present every where and knows all your thoughts your  faith  in this beneficent Being will natu∣rally give you such a dependence on him as will incline you to  pray  to him What ought to be the subject of your prayers  A  I ought to praise God for his mercies to beg his pardon for my sins through the atonement of Christto pray for the assistance  of his holy spirit in all my religious duties and for his blessing on all my worldly con∣cerns  Q  But is it sufficient to pray to God in private  A  No family prayer is highly proper and may be used in most families but  public worship  at church should be omitted by none  Q  How does it appear to be a duty to go to church  A  We have our Saviour's example who used on the sabbathday to go to the syna∣gogue which was the Jewish churchPub∣lic worship also is frequently recommended in different parts of scripture Indeed all peo∣ple want either to have their duty explained or to be reminded of it  II  Q  The next thing you say you  believe  is that the  holy scriptures are the word of God  If you really believe they are the word of God how should you read them  A  With an intention to improve my heart by believing the  doctrines  and obeying the  precepts  contained in them  Q  What do you mean by the  doctrines of scripture  A  I mean particularly the divinity of our blessed Saviourhis atonement for the sins of mankindthe assistance of the holy spirit the resurrection of the deadand a last judgment  Q  And what is the great end of the  pre∣cepts  you find in the scriptures  A  To teach us to  avoid wickedness  and  practice goodness  Q  As wickedness surrounds you on every side it is always right to have an eye upon such sins as  most easily beset you  What sins should you particularly avoid  A  A disregard to God and religion sabbathbreakingswearinglyingcheat∣ing envymalicehatredlewd discourse and actions The catechism comprehends all sin under the  world  the  flesh  and the  devil  The  world  affords temptationsthe  flesh  or our own bad desires are suited to those temptationsand the  devil  we are told is continually drawing us into them  Q  What does the scripture require if you have been unhappily drawn into sin  A  It requires us to repent of it that it may not become habitual  Q  What do you mean by habitual sin  A  A sin that is committed over and over without any check of conscience As some wicked people for instance have gotten so  vile a custom of swearing that they will some∣times swear and hardly know when they swear  Q  And is their not knowing when they swear an excuse for them  A  No because they have brought them∣selves into that condition through their own fault  Q  So again when people get drunk and commit mischief is their drunkenness an ex∣cuse for them  A  No the same reason holds against them in this case also They were drunk through their own fault  Q  What do you mean by  repenting  A  I mean not only being sorry for what I have done amiss and changing my life but changing also my very thoughts and wishes  Q  Suppose you had told a lye and had been punished for it and therefore were afraid of telling a lie again is that repent∣ing of it  A  No it is only being afraid of punish∣ment  Q  But suppose you had told a lie and yet would not tell another tho you were sure nobody could find you out is that re∣penting of it  A  Yes because in that case I am not  afraid of punishment but of doing a wrong thing  Q  And on a supposition that you truly repent of your sins what do you hope from God  A  I humbly hope that my sins will be blotted out through the merits of Christthat my own endeavours will be assisted by God's holy spiritand that I shall be reconciled to God and restored to his favour  Q  But you learn from the holy scriptures you say to  practice goodness  as well as to  avoid wickedness  to love your neighbour in the first place as yourself What do you mean by loving your Neighbour as your∣self  A  I mean being as ready to do good to him as to receive good from him  Q  Whom do you mean by your neigh∣bour  A  All mankind as appears from many parts of scripture but especially from our Saviour's parable of the good Samaritan The Jews considered the Samaritans as ene∣mies and as we learn from the parable to do good to our enemies it surely follows that we should do good to all mankind  Q  How are you to act in order to do to others as you might reasonably desire them to do to you  A  Whenever I am going to do any thing to another and am doubtful whether it be right I should ask myself whether in the same case I should like to have it done to me and if I should not I may be sure it is not right that I should do it to another  Q  What do you mean by doing your duty faithfully whatever your station is  as to the Lord and not unto man  A  I mean that I should consider myself as a part of God's great family which consists of all mankind In this great family God places some high and others low But every person has his station to fill which he should endeavour to fill faithfully And as God is our great master our first reason for doing our duty should be to please him  Q  How should the rich fill their stations  A  They should consider them as trusts in∣tended for the general good Different stati∣ons are necessary for the good of all Every one at sight must acknowledge that neither the government of a family a parish or a country could subsist if all were on an equa∣lity Tho the rich therefore must live in a degree suitable to their several stations they must have an especial care not to suffer that notion to carry them into extravagance or the neglect of the great duty of distributing from their abundance among their poorer  neighbours If they are so absurd as to con∣ceive that God Almighty has placed them in superior stations out of any particular re∣gard which he has for them and so leaves them at liberty to spend all they have upon themselves they will in the end find them∣selves sadly mistaken and will have a strict account to give as our blessed Saviour tells them of the talents with which they have been intrusted  Q  How should the poor person fill his station so as to please God  A  He should do all the good in his power with his little and be content also and satis∣fied with his station He may assure him∣self that if he be  religious frugal  and  indus∣trious  he may enjoy all the real happiness which this world is capable of giving His industry and frugality will supply him with the necessaries of life and his religion will teach him that a  man's life  that is his hap∣piness  consisteth not in the abundance of the things which he possesseth  Q  On a supposition that she rich and poor fill their stations equally well how will God reward them  A  Just alike as appears from different parts of scripture but particularly from the widow's mite She could do very little in comparison with the rich and yet Christ  says she did more than they allthat is she had a better disposition  Q  What do you mean by  increasing in goodness  A  Getting more and more the better of my bad habits  Q  How are you to know  you are in ear∣nest  A  When I feel more pleasure in obeying God than in committing sin  Q  Why should a christian be  advancing always towards perfection  A  Because if he do not always endeavour to be better than he is it is much to be fear∣ed he is growing worse True religion al∣ways makes a man wish to be better  III  Q  You say you next  believe  in Jesus Christ the Son of God and particularly in that great article of his suffering death for the sins of mankind If you really believe this what do you trust in for salvation  A  In the merits of Jesus Christ not in any thing I can do for myself  Q  Will the merits then of Jesus Christ save you if you are wicked  A  Not unless I repent  Q  But if you are good can you be saved without the merits of Jesus Christ  A  I can never be so good as to deserve the happiness of everlasting life My sins will deserve punishment and I shall still want something to save me from their effects  Q  How then do the merits of Jesus Christ save you  A  I must endeavour sincerely to be good and then the merits of Jesus Christ will pro∣cure me pardon for my repented sins and make up what I cannot do myself  Q  But can you do  any thing  yourself to∣wards obtaining salvation  A  I am assured that after all I am an  un∣profitable servant  but God is pleased to ac∣cept my imperfect services through the merits of Jesus Christ  Q  But now besides the religious duties which the gospel points out our blessed Sa∣viour hath ordained the two sacraments of  baptism  and the  Lord's Supper  which in themselves are things indifferent but are rendered binding from their being appointed by him What is the intention of these two ceremonies  A  In general  they are the  sigus  of our re∣ceiving christianity and of God's giving us the privileges of it  Q  But what is the  particular  intention of each  A  Baptism is intended by our blessed Saviour as the introduction or entrance into his religionand the  Lord's Supper  is in∣tended to preserve in our minds the devout remembrance of his death and atonement  Q  The sacraments you see then are not only the signs of our receiving the privileges of christianity but they hold out to us the two greatest truths of our religion What are those truths  A  Baptism holds out to us that we are  fallen sinners  by shewing us through the sign of water that we must be purified by the grace of the gospelAnd the Lord's Supper shews us by the signs of bread and wine that we can only be pardoned through the atoneing blood of Christ  Q  But now as Christ hath ordained both these sacraments why do not all christians think it as necessary to receive the sacrament of the Lord's Supper as to bring their child∣ren to be baptized  A  They ought but some neglect it as they do other good things and some are afraid of texts of scripture which they do not understand  Q  What texts of scripture are they afraid of  A  Chiefly of a passage in St Paul where he says  He that eateth and drinketh unwor∣thily eateth and drinketh damnation to him∣self  Q  To whom is the expression of  eating and drinking unworthily  applied  A  It is applied chiefly to the Corinthians who were guilty of drunkenness and other crimes when they received the Lord's supper which was administered then in private houses and often at the time of feasting Whereas we who receive it in churches where there is no feasting cannot be guilty of the same wicked practices of which the Corinthians were guilty tho at the same time we may receive the sacrament  unworthily  if we do not piously remember the death and atonement of Christ when we receive it and resolve as far as we can to forsake our sins which were the cause of his death  Q  What do mean by  eating and drinking damnation to yourself  A  This is still applied to the unworthy manner in which the Corinthians received the Lord's supper tho the word  damnation  means only that God will  condemn  us or be angry with us for  eating and drinking un∣worthily  as he is for all other wicked things but it does not mean that we shall certainly be  damned  for it  Q  What reason is there for your receiving the sacrament of baptism only once and the sacrament of the Lord's supper frequently  A  Because we can only once enter into the christian religion but we are required frequently to shew that we are members of it by remembring the death and atonement of our blessed Saviour and by renewing the engagements which we made when we be∣came members of his holy religion  IV  Q  You said you believed that  God would assist you by his holy spirit  as you could do nothing to please God without his assistance how is the assistance of his holy spirit to be obtained  A  I must first pray to God through the mediation of Christ for this holy assistance and at the same time I must use my own best endeavours in doing what I can myself trusting in God that he will enable me to overcome such temptations as I could not overcome without his assistance  V  Q  Lastly you say  you believe in a future state  and in the  resurrection of the dead  that  is you say you believe you shall live in ano∣ther world after you leave this and that even your body will not remain in the grave but will rise again and be joined to your soul if then you really and sincerely  believe  all this what  effect  should it have upon you  A  It should raise my thoughts above this mortal life I should not think intirely about this world but consider that I am to live in another world after this And tho while I live in this world it is necessary for me to think about its concerns yet when I consider that in the next world I am to live for ever and in this world only a few years it is certainly right that I should think more about the next world than about this  Q  You say likewise that you  believe in a last judgment  that is you say you believe that hereafter you shall be called to account for every thing you have done in this world and that you shall be rewarded or punished according to what you have done Now if you really believe this great truth how should you be  affected  by it  A  I should be in earnest careful to pre∣pare my self for this awful judgment by sincerely endeavouring to do my duty to God and man or in other words by  believing  and  living as a christian ought to do  THE END  A PRAYER  ALMIGHTY God who through thy good providence hath added one day more to our lives graciously accept our praise and thanksgiving for this and all thy other merciesfor
