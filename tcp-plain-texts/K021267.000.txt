diamonds but it could never be discovered what became of them  Rebate  No  Trueman  No SirBut there is a strong suspicion that they were stolen by a Quaker at whose house he lodged  Rebate  AyeThese diamonds must be the very same of which Primitive Tribulation has advised me  aside  So you say her fortune was in diamondswell wellbut to the business I'm come uponI am ready to settle your master's affairs if he agrees to marry his daughter to my son  Trueman  And if not you are ready to seize upon his effects  Rebate  I am ready to secure my property young manwill he accede to my proposal he can have no doubt upon my sufficiency he knows me to be a  good  man  Trueman  A good man SirYes you are a good man Sir and I wish many whom I know to be good men in money transactions were good men in the discharge of every other moral obligation  Rebate  I don't comprehend you young man  Trueman  Then I'll be explicit old gentleman What good does your boasted goodness arise from Is it from transacting business with the necessitous  upon such terms of hardship as cramp every effort of industry Is it from advancing money on the jointures of distressed widowsthe commissions of reduced officersand the livings of poor clergymen  Rebate  Eh  Trueman  Do you consider yourself a good man because you can make good bargains or is it because you can laugh with good humour at every man's distress I have known the enormous wealth of such good men who while living never did a generous action bequeathed at the hour of death to build an hospital wherein the poor have languished for want of common necessaries while the stewards and domestics have feasted and fattened upon the revenues  Rebate  Do you forget I have your master's bond for eleven thousand and could overwhelm him with ruin  Trueman  I tell you Sir Mr Fairport rejects your proposal with contemptWhat would the world say should a British merchant act with such dishonor  Rebate  Dishonor Why man there is no such thing as dishonor in a transaction of traffic this is the golden age in which every thing is bought and sold  Trueman  But conscience Mr Rebateconscience the estimate of justiceshe is a judge whose admonitions are not to be silenced and rectitude alone can save us from the poignancy of her stings  Rebate  Conscience may be a judge for aught I know but eleven thousand pounds would effectually silence her accusationsmany a judge has held his tongue for half the moneyBut I shall  wait to see your master young man so will take a turn in the garden and no doubt will find the elegance of his improvements equal to the magnificence of his mansion  Trueman  Sir your servant  Rebate  Your most obedient sweetscented Sir  Exit Trueman  What an impudent moralizing rascalthis fellow is not one of your cloventongued gentry with one tongue for his public and another tongue for his private principleshe should have been bred to the churchBut how am I to act interest and passion possess meThis Amelia monopolizes my mindLet me consider her father died at Amsterdam in the house of a Quakeraye it's plain my correspondent Tribulation was the plunderer of his diamonds and these diamonds he was to consign to me for salethe uncle's ruined and could I persuade the niece to come under my protection this would turn out an Argonaut expedition and I should have the sheering of a golden fleeceLet me see    Musing    Enter  Lucy  Lucy  So here he isHave at you old rogue Hem hem  Rebate  Turning about suddenly  Ah ha my girl  Takes Lucy's hand  Egad you are all beauties in this house  Lucy  Beauties SirMiss Amelia my master's niece is beautiful indeed  Rebate  And a witty rogue I dare say  Lucy  A fool your honor for I have heard her say she'd prefer an old man to a young one  Rebate  You joke hussey you joke  Lucy  Not I indeed SirThen sometimes she's half mad  Rebate  Foolish and insaneBoth in my favour  Aside  Lucy  Then to be sure Sir as she is foolish and maddish if she was to marry an old gentleman now suppose such a healthy old gentleman as you Sir he might lock her up you know to preserve her from young gallants  Rebate  Egad you're a wit my girl  Lucy  Who I No indeed your honorI am but young foolish and flighty myself yet I think if a husband was to lock me up to preserve my virtue I'd be tempted to turn so troublesome a companion out of my companyBut as I was going to say I do think Miss Amelia has as delicate a shape as any lady in England  Rebate  So she has so she has you baggage and as inticing a lookCould you now contrive to introduce me to this foolish halfmad Amelia Eh  Lucy  La Sir if I was found out in such a business it would for ever ruin my reputation  Rebate  But it would get you money hussey and those who have money are above reputation or what would become of parties in  crim con  Lucy  Then your honor my conscience  Rebate  Conscience Why conscience child is expelled from both ends of the town or we should not get an enemy's ship insured for love or money the whole system of stockjobbing would be overturned the lottery offices might put out their lamps and the deluded people would no longer be led to destruction by authorized jackalanterns  Lucy  But my honesty  Rebate  Honesty Honesty my lamb is a material drawback on pleasure and profit Those who never deviate from the paths of honesty move like snails through the world they leave a shining track behind but make a very slow progress in the road to preferment  Lucy  But what right have you to expect I should be your friend with the lady    Holding out her hand and rubbing the palm    Rebate  When I have given you nothingEh Well well here here's a retainer for you    Gives her money    Lucy  O dear your honor    Holding up the money and looking at it    I see the matter now quite in a new light  Rebate  And don't let me find you one of those voluble advocates who say a great deal to little purpose or one of those tacit pleaders who pocket their clients fee and say nothing  Lucy  Well Sir step into the parlour on the left side of the hall I'll attend you immediately and will render you every service in my power  Going  but Sir remember now you must be very secret There's no lover a woman admires so much as a secret one  Rebate  Secret never fear me I'm silent as an air gun which does execution without making a reportBut before you go egad I must have  Lucy  curtseying and wiping her mouth  A kiss your honor  kiss  O dear dear I see you'll carry the lady  Rebate  Well I'll wait in the parlorand see find out my son and tell him I desire he may return to LondonHow sweet the little hussey kisses nothing so renovating to age as the breath of a young femaleits more vivifying than the perfumes  of the Spice Islands or the odoriserous breezes of Arabia Felix  Exit  Lucy  Oh here come the lovers  retires  Enter  AMELIA  and  TRUEMAN  Amelia  Nay prithee peace nowsurely this is no time to speak of love  Lucy  coming forward and standing between them  Indeed Ma'am but it isthe present time is always the best to speak of love and I know the captain loves you in his soul  Trueman  The captain LucyWhat captain  Lucy  What captain but yourselfare you not in the military 'sociation Well I never thought the 'sociators would grow so stoutIndeed Madam they shoot cannons  Looking at Amelia  O how Mr Trueman loves you don't blush Ma'am"Would she but marry me my dear Lucy" said he when he gave me this ring"If I had but the good fortune to gain her consent"  Looking at Trueman  La' don't look so sheepish Mr TruemanNow I'd leave nothing to Fortune  Trueman  You are right Lucy Fortune's a gay coquet and neglects the soldier or lover who depends too much upon her smiles My dear Amelia will you give me an answer  Amelia  An answerYou have'nt asked me the question  Lucy  Lord Lord Ma'am can you look in his face and say so are not his eyes twinkling out this very instant will you marry me will you marry me Take her hand Mr Trueman she told me this very day you had her heart  Amelia  And I said true  gives her hand  but you must procure my uncle's consent I have ever  found in him the attention and affection of a father and am bound to obey him from gratitude as well as duty  Trueman  My dear Amelia I admire your candorWhen a woman approves the honest addresses of a man who loves her sure there can be no indelicacy in confessing that she's sensible of his passion  Lucy  O O O there's no standing this tender scene may may may heaven bless you both    sobbing    Enter  FRANK  Frank  I'm as full of intelligence as an Extraordinary Gazette  Trueman  Pray don't be a Gazette on the occasion let us have the whole truth  Frank  I have left Master Praecipe in the pantry where he gormandizes with the appetite of a cormorant and drinks like a fish I have fully persuaded him that Lucy is your cousin Augusta and shall presently introduce him to an interview with her quite in a new character  Lucy  The old gentleman has swallowed every thing I've told him and believes you Ma'am to be a half witted kind of a flighty hairbrained gentlewomanhis passion has made a fool of him and as this is a trial of skill between Frank and me I'll try if I can't get him to take up a new character as well as his son  Trueman  Why Lucy you're a perfect mistress of intrigue  Lucy  I lived two years at a French boardingschool Sirbesides women were always better negotiators than men and were half a dozen brisk girls  like me sent out commissioners to America we'd soon settle business with the Congress  Trueman  I have no doubt of your ability  Lucy  Doubt SirLa I wish we had the settling of the Irish affairs  Amelia  Come let us retire to our several duties  Lucy  I'll go prepare the old man  Frank

uniform suit  Lucy  YOUR son Sir is gone to town and so is Mr Trueman and my master has sent word he won't be here this evening and I've put all the servants out of the way and so we'll have a clear coast to ourselves  Reb  Well well that's right my girl that's rightBut Lucy I can scarcely credit what you tell me of Amelia's disposition  Lucy  Indeed Sir it is true she loves the army above all things and will sometimes speak for an hour together particularly in the full of the moon Sir about battles and soldiers and cutting of throats Here are Mr Trueman's 'sociation regimentalspay your addresses to her in them Sir and you'll carry the day  Reb  Then leave them on the chair and as there's no one in the house to see me play the fool with this mad girl egad I'll e'en attack her  a la militaire  Lucy  And while you're dressing I'll prepare your mistress to receive you  Going she returns  But remember you are to persuade Miss Amelia that you've loved her a long time and that hearing of her uncle's failure you're come to offer her your heart and fortune  Exit  Reb  Foolish and insane as this young lady may be it is rather extraordinary that she should  prefer age to youth  takes off his coat  As to her liking soldiers better than men of any other profession that's commonyour greengirls bite as voraciously at a red rag as mackarel  takes off his waistcoat  But what should become of me if in her madness she should take a sudden aversion to scarlet and fly at me like a turkeycock  puts on the uniform waistcoat  I cannot think she has preference for old man  puts on the coat and looks in the glass  yet why not Love is a capricious passion and not always the consequence of beauty or assiduityThis dress really becomes me  looks in the glass  and I have known one lucky

Reb  Religious That's fuel to my fireNo pleasure gives such exquisite satisfaction to a man of gallantry as ruining a devotee    aside    But how do I look Lucy eh  Lucy  Look your honour looks killingly    walks round him    These lighthorsemen are so smart about the head so spurred upon the heel wear their cloaths so neat to their shapes and have their skirts so trimmed to their hips they

blackened    brings another box and blackens his eyebrows    Now your honour you've a noble soldierly appearance  Reb  These swingeing eyebrows give me too fierce a countenancebut then they set off a smile    grins in the glass    Lucy  Goodday how amiable you look But you must hold up your head thus    puts up his head    And wear your helmet over your left eye thus    settles his helmet    And keep your arms thus    settles his arms    And I must tighten your stock    tightens his stock    Reb  Zounds Lucy you'll strangle me  Lucy  Never fear your honourA soldier should always wear his stock tight enough to force a colour into his facea tight stock is a soldier's dramYou see the guards appear as ruddy in the face and as stiff in the shoulders as if they had been exercised in a pilloryYou must turn out your toes    turns out his toes with her feet    Keep your breast full out thus    Bends him back    March thus    takes him under the arm and marches    To the right about    they face the audience    Aye now you appear perfectly at ease  Reb  At easeEgad my muscles are cracking with exquisite torture But I like this masquerading it seasons an amour to the highest  goüt  and is the very spice the poignant sauce of an intrigueI shall reward you liberally  Lucy  And I sha'n't oppose your honour's liberalityto be proof against a bribe would shew a vulgar education  Reb  TrueAnd persons of the first rank are rewarded under the head of secret service But here    gives her a purse    You have no more scruples now I hope about conscience honour and honesty  Lucy  No

Methodistsand Honesty to the Jews  Lucy  Nay your honour keep a little of each for us poor christians  Reb  Egad my girl I see you're no novice  Lucy  A novice at eighteen No no we have more experience at that age in London than country girls at twentyfive City roses blow apace and it's generally summer with us before it should be springI shot my first arrow at sixteen hit my man and he turning false I have ever since carried two strings to my bow But it's time colonel I should introduce you  Reb  Lead on I follow    They march off Lucy humming a march    Enter  PRAECIPE  and  FRANK  PRAECIPE  in an old fashioned naval uniform and hat a sword stick and black patch on one eye    Frank  This uniform fits you exactly Sir I borrowed it from an old sea officer in the neighbourhoodYou really look as brave and seamanlike as if you were one of the Admirals in  Westminster Abbey descended from his monument  Praecipe  I wish some of them had descended they have been wanting Master FrankBut I object to this black patch on my eye it brings me under statute ninth of George the first chapter twentysecond which makes it felony without clergy to go with the face disguised  Frank  That act must have lost its force Sir or what would become of the painted beauties of London  Praecipe  Then as a body may say I am only a seaman by fiction but the law says fictions are beneficialBut then says the law again no fiction shall work an injury Very well there can be no injury in my marrying a woman of fortune  Frank  True Sir  Praecipe  Let us moot the caseIn fiction subsists equity and justice say the booksthen will I marry Miss Fairport in the equity of fiction and afterwards be happy  Frank  In reality Sir  Praecipe  If not happy we can separate by fictionI'll state you a case in pointA brings his action of  crim con  against B now though the cause of action had been transacted in the most loving manner between B and the wife of A yet must A state in his declaration that the said B did wickedly and maliciously with force and arms that is to say with sticks clubs staves swords guns and other offensive weapons seduce and  et caetera  the wife of the said A Do you

of the blackest crime can be committed by a subject against his king and countrygiving succour to their enemies  Praecipe  Hightreason as I always told you father when you quoted the Dutch as a precedent for having when at war sold powder and ball to the enemy to pepper their own carcases  Trueman  Mr RebateThis letter is directed to you Sir and from its contents I have reason to conclude that the diamonds you have received from Amsterdam are the property of this lady  Rebate  Diamonds  Amelia  Yes Sir diamondsThis letter is certainly written by the Quaker at whose house my father lodged  Rebate  Looking at the letter  O I shall run mad  Lucy  Here are the diamonds Madam  delivering the case  Rebate  And did you idiot give a receipt for those monies and diamonds in my name  to

of a merchant like the virtue of a woman or the courage of a soldier is his point of honor and that as no recompense can satisfy the loss of credit no punishment is too severe for the villain who dares to traduce it  Rebate  I'll stay no longerI'll convert all my effects into cash and fly to Holland where every man who has money may be sure of protection  Exit  Praecipe  Wait for your cloaths fathermy wife shall recover your suit  Trueman  What we have experienced will I hope teach us this moralthat while virtue guides our passions happiness is the certain consequence and that misery is ever the result of submitting to vicious habits May every Briton bring these precepts into practiceand may every Briton also remember that as the credit the wealth the strength the dignity of the British empire flow from commerce to support and extend commerce is the indispensible duty of every British subject  Exeunt  THE END  Lately published by the same Author  Price s d sewed The SECOND
