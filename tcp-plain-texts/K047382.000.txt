 WHAT we must ALL come toâ–ª A COMEDY In TWO ACTS As it was intended to be ACTED at the THEATREROYAL in COVENTGARDEN  Otium et oppidi  Laudat rura sui  HOR  Nugae seria ducent  In mala  HOR  LONDON Printed for P VAILLANT facing Southamptonstreet in the Strand MDCCLXIV  Price One Shilling  Advertisement  THE idea of the Character of  DRUGGET  in the following piece was taken from a paper written by Mr  POPE  and published in the  Guardian No  The reader will perceive some strictures of true humour from thence inserted in this little Comedy The violent differences between  Sir Charles  and  Lady Rackett  about a trifle and the renewal of those differences by venturing after they had subsided to resume the object in thorough good humour are it is conceived founded in Nature because similar incidents often occur in real life To shew the passions thus frivolously agitated and to point out the ridicule springing from their various turns and shiftings was the main drift of the ensuing scenes But some people were determined not to hear and the Author could not be induced by any private motives to send the Performers a second time into so painful a service as that of the Stage always is when a few are unwilling to be entertained  Lincoln's Inn  January  Dramatis Personae  MEN  Sir CHARLES RACKETT  Mr DYER  DRUGGET  Mr SHUTER  LOVELACE  Mr CUSHING  WOODLEY  Mr WHITE

tell you Mr Woodley you are a mere novice in these affairs  Wood  Nay but listen to reason Mrs Dimityhas not your master Mr Drugget invited me down to his countryhouse in order to give me his daughter Nancy in marriage and with what pretence can he now break off  Dim  What pretence you put a body out of all patiencebut go on your own way Sir my advice is all lost upon you  Wood  Come now do me justicehave not I fix'd an interest in the young lady's heart  Dim  An interest in a fiddlestickYou ought to have made love to the father and  motherwhat do you think the way to get a wise is by speaking fine things to the lady you've a fancy forThat was the practice indeed but things are alter'd nowyou must address the old people Sir and never trouble your head about your mistressNone of your letters and verses and soft looks and fine speeches"Have compassion thou angelic creature on a poor dying"Pshaw stuff nonsense all out of fashionGo your ways to the old Curmudgeon humour his whims"I shall esteem it an honour Sir to be allied to a gentleman of your rank and taste" "Upon my word he's a pretty young gentleman"Then wheel about to the mother "Your daughter Ma'am is the very model of you and I shall adore her for your sake" "Here come hither Nancy take this gentleman for better for worse" "La Mama I can never consent""I should not have thought of your consentthe consent of your relations is enough why how now HusseySo away you go to church the knot is tied and you quarrel like contrary elements all the rest of your livesthat's the way of the world now"  Wood  But you know my dear Dimity the old couple have received every mark of mention from me  Dim  Attention to be sure you did not fall asleep in their company but what thenYou should have entered into their characters play'd with their humours and sacrificed to their absurdities  Wood  Bat if my temper is too frank  Dim  Frank indeed I hate the word except when I receive a letterHave not you to do with a rich old shopkeeper retired from business with an hundred thousand pounds in his pocket to enjoy the dust of the London road which he calls living in the countryand yet you must find fault with his situationWhat if he has made a ridiculous gimcrack of his house and gardens you know his heart is set upon it and could not you have commended his taste But you must be too frank"Those walks and alleys are too regularthose evergreens should not be cut into such fantastic shapes"And thus you advise a poor old mechanic who delights in every thing that's monstrous to follow natureOh you're likely to be a successful lover  Wood  But why should not I save a fatherinlaw from being a laughingstock  Dim  Make him your fatherinlaw first  Wood  Why he can't open his windows for the dusthe stands all day looking thro' a pane of glass and he calls that living in the fresh air and enjoying his own thoughts  Dim  Po Poyou have ruin'd yourself by talking sense to him and all your nonsense to the daughter won't make amends for itAnd then the mother how have you play'd your car  s in that quarterShe wants a tinsel man of fashion for her second daughter"Don't you see  says she  how happy my eldest girl is made by marrying Sir Charles RackettNancy shall have a man of quality too"  Wood  And yet I know Sir Charles Rackett perfectly well  Dim  Yes so do I and I know he'll make his lady wretched at lastBut what then You should have humour'd the old folks you should have been a talking empty fop to the good old lady and to the old gentleman an admirer of his taste in gardening But you

sweet eyes  Were with their dear meaning so bright  I trembled and lost in surprize  My heart it went throb with delight    When his lips their dear accents did try  The return of my love to excite  I feign'd yet began to guess why  My heart it went throb with delight    We chang'd the stol'n glance the fond smile  Which lovers alone read aright  We look'd and we sigh'd yet the while  Our hearts they went throb with delight    Consent I soon blush'd with a sigh  My promise I ventur'd to plight  Come Hymen we then shall know why  Our hearts they go throb with delight  Enter  WOODLEY  Wood  My

me any more  SONG  I  TO dance and to dress and to flaunt it about  To run to Park play to assembly and rout  To wander for ever in whim's giddy maze  And one poor hair torture a million of ways  To put at the glass ev'ry feature to school  And practise their art on each fop and each fool  Of one thing to think and another to tell  These these are the manners of each giddy belle    To smile and to simper white teeth to display  The time in gay follies to trifle away  Against ev'ry virtue the bosom to steel  And only of dress the anxieties feel  To be at Eve's ear the insidious decoy  The pleasure ne'er taste yet the mischief enjoy  To boast of soft raptures they never can know  These these are the manners of each giddy beau  Exit  Love  I must have her notwithstanding thisfor tho' I am not in love yet I'm in debt  Enter  DRUGGET  Drug  So Mr Lovelace any news from abovestairs Is this absurd quarrel at an endhave they made it up  Love  Oh a mere bagatelle Sirthese little fracas

Lady R  Oh my dear Sir this is nothingI have a lure to bring the gentleman back again  Drug  Never tell meit's too late nowMr Woodley I recommend my girl to your careI shall have nothing now to think of but my greens and my images and my shrubberytho' mercy on all married folks say Ifor these wranglings are I am afraid  What we must All come to  Lady Rackett coming forward  WHAT we must all come to  WhatCome to what  Must broils and quarrels be the marriage lot  If that's the wise deep meaning of our poet  The man's a fool a blockhead and I'll shew it  What could induce him in an age so nice  So fam'd for virtue so refin'd from vice  To form a plan so trivial false and low  As if a belle could quarrel with a beau  As if there werein these thrice happy days  One who from nature or from reason strays  There's no cross husband now no wrangling wife  The man is downright ignorant of life  'Tis the millennium thisdevoid of guile  Fair gentle Truth and whiterob'd Candour smile  From every breast the forbid love of gold  Is banish'd quiteno boroughs now are sold  Fray tell me Sirsfor I don't know I vow  Prayis there such a thing as Gaming now  Do peers make laws against that giant Vice  And then at Arthur's break them in a trice  Nonoour lives are virtuous all austere and hard  Pray ladies do you ever see a card  Those empty boxes shew you don't love plays  The managers poor souls get nothing now a days  If here you comeby chancebut once a week  The pit can witness that you never speak  Pensive Attention sits with decent mien  No paint no naked shoulders to be seen  And yet this grave this moral pious age  May learn one useful lesson from the stage  Shun strife ye fair and once a contest o'er  Wake to a blaze the dying flame no more  From fierce debate sly all the tender Love  And Venus cries "Coachman Putto my doves"  The genial bed no blooming Grace prepares  "And every day becomes a day of cares"  FINIS
