SUPPLEMENT TO CHATTERTON'S MISCELLANIES  TO A FRIEND  MARCH TH  DEAR FRIEND  I HAVE received both your favoursThe Muse alone must tell my joy  O'ER WHELM'D with pleasure at the joyful news  I strung the chorded shell and woke the Muse  Begin O Servant of the Sacred Nine  And echo joy through ev'ry nervous line  Bring down th' etherial Choir to aid the Song  Let boundless raptures smoothly glide along  My Baker's wellOh words of sweet delight  Now now my Muse soar up th' Olympic height  What wond'rous numbers can the Goddess find  To paint th' extatic raptures of my mind  I leave it to a Goddess more divine  The beauteous Hld shall employ my line  TO THE BEAUTEOUS MISS HLD  FAR distant from Brittannia's lofty Isle  What shall I find to make the Genius smile  The bubbling fountains lose the power to please  The rocky cataracts the shady trees  The juicy fruitage of enchanting hue  Whose luscious virtues England never knew  The variegated Daughters of the Land  Whose numbers Flora strows with bounteous hand  The verdant vesture of the smiling fields  All the rich pleasures Nature's storehouse yields  Have all their powers to wake the chorded string  But still they're subjects that the Muse can sing  Hld more beauteous than the God of Day  Her name can quicken and awake the Lay  Rouse the soft Muse from indolence and ease  To live to love and rouse her powers to please  In vain would Phoebus did not Hld rise  'Tis her bright eyes that gilds the Eastern skies  'Tis she alone deprives us of the light  And when she slumbers then indeed 'tis night  To tell the sep'rate beauties of her 'face  Would stretch Eternity's remotest space  And want a more than man to pen the line  I rest let this suffice dear Hld's all divine  ODE TO MISS HLD    AMIDST the wild and dreary dells  The distant echogiving bells  The bending mountains head  Whilst Ev'ning moving thro' the sky  Over the object and the eye  Her pitchy robes doth spread  There gently moving thro' the vale  Bending before the blust'ring gale  Fell apparitions glide  Whilst roaring rivers echo round  The drear reverberating sound  Runs thro' the mountain side  Then steal I softly to the grove  And singing of the Nymph I love  Sigh out my sad complaint  To paint the tortures of my mind  Where can the Muses numbers find  Ah numbers are too faint  Ah Hld Empress of my heart  When will thy breast admit the dart  And own a mutual flame  When wand'ring in the myrtle groves  Shall mutual pleasures seal our loves  Pleasures without a name  Thou greatest beauty of the sex  When will the little God perplex  The mansions of thy breast  When wilt thou own a flame as pure  As that seraphic souls endure  And make thy Baker blest  O haste to give my passion ease  And bid the perturbation cease  That harrows up my soul  The joy such happiness to find  Would make the functions of my mind  In peace and love to roll  ACROSTIC ON MISS    ENCHANTING is the mighty power of Love  Life stript of amorous joys would irksome prove  Ev'n Heaven's great Thund'rer woreth' easy chain  And over all the world Love keeps his reign  No human heart can bear the piercing blade  Or I than others am more tender made  Right thro' my heart a burning arrow drove  Hoyland's bright eyes were made the bows of Love  Oh torture inexpressibly severe  You are the pleasing Author of my care  Look down fair Angel on a Swain distrest  A gracious smile from you would make me blest  Nothing but that blest favour stills my grief  Death that denied will quickly give relief  ACROSTIC ON MISS    SERAPHIC Virgins of the tuneful Choir  Assist me to prepare the sounding lyre  Like her I sing soft sensible and fair  Let the smooth numbers warble in the air  Ye Prudes Coquets and all the misled throng  Can Beauty Virtue Sense demand the Song  Look then on Clarke and see them all unite  A beauteous pattern to the alwaysright  Rest here my Muse not soar above thy sphere  Kings might pay adoration to the fair  Enchanting full of joy peerless in face and air  TO MISS HLD    ONCE more the Muse to beauteous Hld sings  Her grateful tribute of harsh numbers brings  To Hld Nature's richest sweetest store  She made an Hld and can make no more  Nor all the beauties of the world's vast round  United will as sweet as her be found  Description sickens to rehearfe her praise  Her worth alone will deify my days  Enchanting creature Charms so great as thine  May all the beauties of the day outshine  Thy eyes to ev'ry gazer send a dart  Thy taking graces captivate the heart  O for a Muse that shall ascend the skies  And like the subject of the Epode rise  To sing the sparkling eye the portly grace  The thousand beauties that adorn the face  Of my seraphic Maid whose beauteous charms  Might court the world to rush at once to arms  Whilst the fair Goddess native of the skies  Shall sit above and be the Victor's prize  O now whil'st yet I sound the tuneful lyre  I feel the thrilling joy her hands inspire  When the soft tender touch awakes my blood  And rolls my passions with the purple flood  My pulse beat high my throbbing breast's on fire  In sad variety of wild desire  O Hld Heav'nly Goddess Angel Saint  Words are too weak thy mighty worth to paint  Thou best compleatest work that Nature made  Thou art my substance and I am thy shade  Possess'd of thee I joyfully would go  Thro' the loud tempest and the depth of woe  From thee alone my being I derive  One beauteous smile from thee makes all my hopes alive  TO MISS HLD    SINCE short the busy scene of life will prove  Let us my Hld learn to live and love  To love with passions pure as morning light  Whose saffron beams unsullied by the night  With rosy mantles do the Heavens streak  Faint imitators of my Hld's cheek  The joys of Nature in her ruin'd state  Have little pleasure tho' the pains are great  Virtue and Love when sacred bands unite  'Tis then that Nature leads to true delight  Oft as I wander thro' the myrtle grove  Bearing the beauteous burden of my love  A secret terror lest I should offend  The charming Maid on whom my joys depend  Informs my soul that virtuous minds alone  Can give a pleasure to the vile unknown  But when the body charming and the mind  To ev'ry virtuous christian act inclin'd  Meet in one person Maid and Angel join  Who must it be but Hld the divine  What worth intrinsic will that man possess  Whom the dear charmer condescends to bless  Swift will the minutes roll the flying hours  And blessings overtake the pair by showers  Each moment will improve upon the past  And every day be better than the last  Love means an unadulterated flame  Tho' lust too oft usurps the sacred name  Such passion as in Hld's breast can move  'Tis that alone deserves the name of Love  Oh was my merit great enough to find  A favour'd station in my Hld's mind  Then would my happiness be quite compleat  And all revolving joys as in a center meet  TO MISS HLD    TELL me God of soft desires  Little Cupid wanton Boy  How thou kindlest up thy fires  Giving pleasing pain and joy  Hld's beauty is thy bow  Striking glances are thy darts  Making conquests never slow  Ever gaining conquer'd hearts  Heaven is seated in her smile  Juno's in her portly air  Not Britania's fav'rite Isle  Can produce a Nymph so fair  In a desart vast and drear  Where disorder springs around  If the lovely Fair is there  'Tis a pleasuregiving ground  Oh my Hld blest with thee  I'd the raging storm defy  In thy smiles I live am free  When thou frownest I must die  TO MISS HLD    WITH A PRESENT  ACCEPT fair Nymph this token of my love  Nor look disdainful on the prostrate Swain  By ev'ry sacred oath I'll constant prove  And act as worthy for to wear your chain  Not with more constant ardour shall the sun  Chase the faint shadows of the night away  Nor shall he on his course more constant run  And cheer the universe with coming day  Than I in pleasing chains of conquest bound  Adore the charming Author of my smart  For ever will I thy sweet charms resound  And paint the fair Possessor of my heart  TO MISS HLD    COUNT all the flow'rs that deck the meadow's side  When Flora flourishes in newborn pride  Count all the sparkling orbits in the sky  Count all the birds that thro' the aether sly  Count all the foliage of the lofty trees  That fly before the bleak autumnal breeze  Count all the dewy blades of verdant grass  Count all the drops of rain that softly pass  Thro' the blue aether or tempestuous roar  Count all the sands upon the breaking shore  Count all the minutes since the world began  Count all the troubles of the life of man  Count all the torments of the dn'd in Hell  More are the beauteous charms that makes my Nymph excell  TO MISS CKE    TO sing of Clarke my Muse aspires  A theme by charms made quite divine  Ye tuneful Virgins sound your lyres  Apollo aid the feeble line  If Truth and Virtue Wit and Charms  May for a fix'd attention call  The darts of Love and wounding arms  The beauteous Clarke shall hold o'er all  'Tis not the tincture of a skin  The rosy lip the charming eye  No 'tis a greater Power within  That bids the passion never die  These Clarke possesses and much more  All beauty in her glances sport  She is the Goddess all adore  In Country City and at Court  EPISTLE TO THE REVEREND MR CATCOTT  DECEMBER TH  WHAT strange infatuations rule mankind  How narrow are our prospects how confin'd  With universal vanity possest  We fondly think our own ideas best  Our tott'ring arguments are ever strong  We're always selfsufficient in the wrong  What philosophic Sage of pride austere  Can lend conviction an attentive ear  What pattern of humility and truth  Can bear the jeering ridicule of youth  What blushing Author ever rank'd his Muse  With Fowler's PoetLaureat of the Stews  Dull Penny nodding o'er his wooden lyre  Conceits the vapours of Geneva fire  All in the language of Apostles cry  If Angels contradict me Angels lie  As all have intervals of ease and pain  So all have intervals of being vain  But some of folly never shift the scene  Or let one lucid moment intervene  Dull single acts of manyfooted Prose  Their tragicomedys of life compose  Incessant madding for a system toy  The greatest of Creations blessings cloy  Their senses dosing a continual dream  They hang enraptured o'er the hideous scheme  So virgins tott'ring into ripe three score  Their greatest likeness in baboons adore  When you advance new systems first unfold  The various imperfections of the old  Prove Nature hitherto a gloomy night  You the first focus of primaeval light  'Tis not enough you think your system true  The busy world wou'd have you prove it too  Then rising on the ruins of the rest  Plainly demonstrate your ideas best  Many are best one only can be right  Tho' all had inspiration to indite  Some this unwelcome truth perhaps would tell  Where Clogher stumbled Catcott fairly fell  Writers on Rolls of Science long renown'd  In one fell page are tumbled to the ground  We see their systems unconfuted still  But Catcott can confute themif he will  Would you the honour of a Priest mistrust  An excommunication proves him just  Could Catcott from his better sense be drawn  To bow the knee to Baal's sacred lawn  A mitred Rascal to his longear'd flocks  Gives ill example to his whs the px  Yet we must reverence sacerdotal black  And saddle all his faults on Nature's back  But hold there's solid reason to revere  His Lordship has six thousand pounds a year  In gaming solitude he spends the nights  He fasts at Arthur's and he prays at White's  Rolls o'er the pavement with his Swisstail'd six  At White's the Athanasian Creed for Tricks  Whil'st the poor Curate in his rusty gown  Trudges unnotic'd thro' the dirty town  If God made order order never made  These nice distinctions in the preaching trade  The servants of the Devil are rever'd  And Bishops pull the Fathers by the beard  Yet in these horrid forms Salvation lives  These are Religions representatives  Yet to these idols must we bow the knee  Excuse me Broughton when I bow to thee  But sure Religion can produce at least  One Minister of Godone honest Priest  Search Nature o'er procure me if you can  The fancy'd character an honest Man  A man of sense not honest by constraint  For fools are canvass living but in paint  To Mammon or to Superstition slaves  All orders of mankind are fools or knaves  In the first attribute by none surpast  Taylor endeavours to obtain the last  Imagination may be too confin'd  Few see too far how many are half blind  How are your feeble arguments perplext  To find out meaning in a senseless text  You rack each metaphor upon the wheel  And words can philosophic truths conceal  What Paracelsus humor'd as a jest  You realize to prove your system best  Might we not Catcott then infer from hence  Your zeal for Scripture hath devour'd your sense  Apply the glass of reason to your sight  See Nature marshal oozy atoms right  Think for yourself for all mankind are free  We need not Inspiration how to see  If Scripture contradictory you find  Be Orthodox and own your senses blind  How blinded are their optics who aver  What Inspiration dictates cannot err  Whence is this boasted Inspiration sent  Which makes us utter truths we never meant  Which couches systems in a single word  At once deprav'd abstruse sublime absurd  What Moses tells us might perhaps be true  As he was learn'd in all the Egyptians knew  But to assert that Inspiration's giv'n  The Copy of Philosophy in Heav'n  Strikes at Religions root and fairly fells  The awful terrors of ten thousand Hells  Attentive search the Scriptures and you'll find  What vulgar errors are with truths combin'd  Your tortur'd truths which Moses seem'd to know  He could not unto Inspiration owe  For if from God one error you admit  How dubious is the rest of Holy Writ  What knotty difficultys fancy solves  The Heav'ns irradiate and the Earth revolves  But here Imagination is allow'd  To clear this voucher from its mantling cloud  From the same word we different meanings quote  As David wears a many colour'd coat  O Inspiration ever hid in night  Reflecting various each adjacent light  If Moses caught thee in the parted flood  If David found thee in a sea of blood  If Mahomet with slaughter drench'd thy soil  On loaded asses bearing off thy spoil  If thou hast favour'd Pagan Turk or Jew  Say had not Broughton Inspiration too  Such rank absurdities debase his line  I almost could have sworn he copied thine  Confute with candour where you can confute  Reason and arrogance but poorly suit  Yourself may fall before some abler pen  Infallibility is not for men  With modest diffidence new schemes indite  Be not too positive tho' in the right  What man of sense would value vulgar praise  Or rise on Penny's prose or duller lays  Tho' pointed fingers mark the Man of Fame  And literary Grocers chaunt your name  Tho' in each Taylors bookcase Catcott shines  With ornamental flow'rs and gilded lines  Tho' youthful Ladies who by instinct scan  The Natural Philosophy of Man  Can ev'ry reason of your work repeat  As sands in Africa retain the heat  Yet check your flowing pride Will all allow  To wreathe the labour'd laurel round your brow  Some may with seeming arguments dispense  Tickling your vanity to wound your sense  But Clayfield censures and demonstrates too  Your theory is certainly untrue  On Reason and Newtonian rules he proves  How distant your machine from either moves  But my objections may be reckon'd weak  As nothing but my mother tongue I speak  Else would I ask by what immortal Pow'r  All Nature was dissolv'd as in an hour  How when the earth acquir'd a solid state  And rising mountains saw the waves abate  Each particle of matter sought its kind  All in a strata regular combin'd  When instantaneously the liquid heap  Harden'd to rocks the barriers of the deep  Why did not earth unite a stony mass  Since stony filaments thro' all must pass  If on the wings of air the planets run  Why are they not impell'd into the sun  Philosophy nay common sense will prove  All passives with their active agents move  If the diurnal motion of the air  Revolves the planets in their destin'd sphere  How are the secondary orbs impell'd  How are the moons from falling headlong held  'Twas the Eternal's fiat you reply  And who will give Eternity the lie  I own the awful truth that God made all  And by his fiat worlds and systems fall  But study Nature not an atom there  Will unassisted by her powers appear  The fiat without agents is at best  For priestcraft or for ignorance a vest  Some fancy God is what we Nature call  Being itself material all in all  The fragments of the Deity we own  Is vulgarly as various matter known  No agents could assist Creations birth  We trample on our God for God is Earth  'Tis past the pow'r of language to confute  This latitudinary attribute  How lofty must Imagination soar  To reach absurdities unknown before  Thanks to thy pinions Broughton thou hast brought  From the Moons orb a novelty of thought  Restrain O Muse thy unaccomplish'd lines  Fling not thy saucy satire at Divines  This single truth thy brother Bards must tell  Thou hast one excellence of railing well  But disputations are befitting those  Who settle Hebrew points and scold in prose  O Learning where are all thy fancied joys  Thy empty pleasures and thy solemn toys  Proud of thy own importance tho' we see  We've little reason to be proud of thee  Thou putrid foetus of a barren brain  Thou offspring illegitimate of Pain  Tell me sententious Mortals tell me whence  You claim the preference to men of sense  wants learning see the letter'd throng  Banter his English in a Latin song  Oxonian Sages hesitate to speak  Their native Language but declaim in Greek  If in his jests a discord should appear  A dull lampoon is innocently clear  Ye Classic Dunces selfsufficient fools  Is this the boasted justice of your schools  has parts parts which would set aside  The labour'd acquisitions of your pride  Uncultivated now his Genius lies  Instruction sees his latent beauties rise  His gold is bullion yours debas'd with brass  Imprest with Folly's head to make it pass  Butswears so loud so indiscreet  His thunders rattle thro' the list'ning street  Ye rigid Christians formally severe  Blind to his charities his oaths you hear  Observe his virtues Calumny must own  A noble soul is in his actions shown  Tho' dark this bright original you paint  I'd rather be athan a Saint  Excuse me Catcott if from you I stray  The Muse will go where Merit leads the way  The Owls of Learning may admire the night  Butshines with Reason's glowing light  Still Admonition presses to my pen  The infant Muse would give advice to Men  But what avails it since the man I blame  Owns no superior in the paths of fame  In springs in mountains strata's mines and rocks  Catcott is every notion Orthodox  If to think otherwise you claim pretence  Which is the true reading is uncertain both being in his own handwriting and uncancelled  Renounce detested heretick in sense  Which is the true reading is uncertain both being in his own handwriting and uncancelled  You're a detested heretick in sense  But oh how lofty your ideas roar  In shewing wond'ring Cits the fossile store  The Ladies are quite ravish'd as he tells  The short adventures of the pretty shells  Miss Biddy sickens to indulge her touch  Madam more prudent thinks 'twould seem too much  The doors fly open instantly he draws  The sparry lood and wonders of applause  The full dress'd Lady sees with envying eye  The sparkle of her di'mond pendants die  Sage Natural Philosophers adore  The fossil whimsys of the numerous store  But see the purple stream begins to play  To shew how fountains climb the hilly way  Hark what a murmur echoes thro' the throng  Gods that the pretty trifle should be wrong  Experience in the voice of Reason tells  Above its surface water never swells  Where is the priestly soul of Catcott now  See what a triumph sits upon his brow  And can the poor applause of things like these  Whose souls and sentiments are all disease  Raise little triumphs in a man like you  Catcott the foremost of the Judging few  So at Llewellins your great Brother sits  The laughter of his tributary wits  Ruling the noisy multitude with ease  Empties his pint and sputters his decrees  DEC TH  MR CATCOTT will be pleased to observe that I admire many things in his learned Remarks This Poem is an innocent effort of poetical Vengeance as Mr Catcott has done me the honour to criticise my Trifles I have taken great poetical liberties and what I dislike in Verse possibly deserves my approbation in the plain Prose of TruthThe many Admirers of Mr Catcott may on perusal of this rank me as an Enemy But I am indifferent in all things I value neither the praise or censure of the Multitude  SENTIMENT    SINCE we can die but once what matters it  If rope or garter poison pistol sword  Slowwasting sickness or the sudden burst  Of valve arterial in the noble parts  Curtail the miseries of human life  Tho' varied is the Cause the Effect's the same  All to one common Dissolution tends  THE DEFENCE  DEC TH  NO more dear Smith the hackney'd Tale renew  I own their censure I approve it too  For how can Ideots destitute of thought  Conceive or estimate but as they're taught  Say can the satirizing Pen of Shears  Exalt his name or mutilate his ears  None but a Lawrence can adore his Lays  Who in a quart of Claret drinks his praise  Tlr repeats what Catcott told before  But lying Tlr is believ'd no more  If in myself I think my notions just  The Church and all her arguments are dust  Religion's but Opinion's bastard Son  A perfect mystery more than three in one  'Tis fancy all distempers of the mind  As Education taught us we're inclin'd  Happy the man whose reason bids him see  Mankind are by the state of Nature free  Who thinking for himself despises those  That would upon his better sense impose  Is to himself the Minister of God  Nor dreads the path where Athanasius trod  Happy if Mortals can be is the Man  Who not by Priest but Reason rules his span  Reason to its Possessor a sure guide  Reason a thorn in Revelations side  If Reason fails incapable to tread  Thro' gloomy Revelations thick'ning bed  On what authority the Church we own  How shall we worship Deities unknown  Can the Eternal Justice pleas'd receive  The prayers of those who ignorant believe  Search the thick multitudes of ev'ry Sect  The Church supreme with Whitfield's new Elect  No individual can their God define  No not great Penny in his nervous Line  But why must Chatterton selected sit  The butt of ev'ry Critic's little wit  Am I alone for ever in a crime  Nonsense in Prose or blasphemy in Rhyme  All monosyllables a line appears  Is it not very often so in Shears  See gen'rous Eccas length'ning out my praise  Inraptur'd with the music of my Lays  In all the arts of panegyric grac'd  The cream of modern Literary Taste  Why to be sure the metaphoric line  Has something sentimental tender fine  But then how hobbling are the other two  There are some beauties but they're very few  Besides the Author 'faith 'tis something odd  Commends a reverential awe of God  Read but another fancy of his brain  He's Atheistical in every strain  Fallacious is the charge 'Tis all a lie  As to my reason I can testify  I own a God immortal boundless wise  Who bid our glories of Creation rise  Who form'd his varied likeness in mankind  Centring his many wonders in the mind  Who saw Religion a fantastic night  But gave us Reason to obtain the light  Indulgent Whitfield scruples not to say  He only can direct to Heavens highway  While Bishops with as much vehemence tell  Both in the Author's handwriting and uncancelled  Sects heterodox are food for Hell  Both in the Author's handwriting and uncancelled  All sorts heterodox are food for Hell  Why then dear Smith since Doctors disagree  Their notions are not oracles to me  What I think right I ever will pursue  And leave you liberty to do so too  SONG TO MR G CATCOTT      AH blame me not Catcott if from the right way  My notions and actions run far  How can my ideas do other but stray  Depriv'd of the ruling North Star    Ah blame me not Broderip if mounted aloft  I chatter and spoil the dull air  How can I imagine thy foppery soft  When discord's the voice of my fair    If Turner remitted my bluster and rhymes  If Harding was girlish and cold  If never an ogle was met from Miss Grimes  If Flavia was blasted and old    I chose without liking and left without pain  Nor welcom'd the frown with a sigh  I scorn'd like a monkey to dangle my chain  And paint them new charms with a lie    Once Cotton was handsome I flam'd and I burn'd  I died to obtain the bright Queen  But when I beheld my Epistle return'd  By Jesu it alter'd the scene    She's damnable ugly my Vanity cried  You lie says my Conscience you lie  Resolving to follow the dictates of Pride  I'd view her a hag to my eye    But should she regain her bright lustre again  And shine in her natural charms  'Tis but to accept of the works of my pen  And permit me to use my own arms  O'Ro  e  upon his courser fleet  Who swift as lightning were his feet  First gain'd the lists and gatte him fame  From West Hybernee Isle he came  His myghte depictur'd in his  Probably alluding to the word Rock  name  All dreded such an one to meet  Bold as a mountain wolf he stood  Upon his swerde sat grim dethe and bloude  But when he threwe down his Asenglave  Next came in  Sir Botelier  bold and brave  The dethe of manie a Saraceen  Theie thought him a Devil from Hells black pen  Ne thinking that anie of mortalle menne  Could send so manie to the grave  For his life to  John Rumsee  he render'd his thanks  Descended from  Godred  the King of the Manks  Within his sure rest he settled his speare  And ran at  O'Rocke  in full career  Their launces with the furious stroke  Into a thousand shivers broke  Even as the thunder tears the oak  And scatters splinters here and there  So great the shock their senses did depart  The bloude all ran to strengthen up the harte  Syr Botelier Rumsie  first came from his traunce  And from the Marshall toke the launce  O'Rocke  eke chose another speere  And ran at  Syr Botelier  full career  His prancynge stede the ground did tare  In haste he made a false advance  Syr Botelier  seeing with myghte amain  Fellde him down upon the playne  Syr Pigotte Novlin  at the Clarions sound  On a milkwhite stede with gold trappings around  He couchde in his rest his silverpoynt speere  And ferslie ranne up in full career  But for his appearance he payed full deare  In the first course laid on the ground  Besmeer'd in the dust with his silver and gold  No longer a glorious sight to behold  Syr Botelier  then having conquer'd his twayne  Rode Conqueror off the tourneying playne  Receivying a garland from  Alice  's hand  The sayrest Ladye in the lande  Syr Pigotte  this viewed and furious did stand  Tormented in mind and bodily peyne  Syr Botelier  crown'd most galantlie stode  As some tall oak within the thick wode  Awhile the shrill Clarions sounded the word  Next rode in  Syr John of Adderleigh  Lord  Who over his back his thick shield did bryng  In checkee of redde and silver sheeninge  With steede and gold trappings beseeming a King  A guilded fine Adder twyned round his swerde  De Bretville  advanced a man of great myghte  And couched his launce in his rest for the fyghte  Ferse as the falling waters of the lough  That tumble headlonge from the mountains browe  Ev'n so they met in drierie sound  De Bretville  fell upon the ground  The bloude from inward bruised wound  Did out his stained helmet flowe  As some tall bark upon the foamie main  So laie  De Bretville  on the plain  Syr John of the Dale  or  Compton  hight  Advanced next in lists of fyght  He knew the tricks of tourneying full well  In running race ne manne culd him excell  Or how to wielde a sworde better tel  And eke he was a manne of might  On a black Stede with silver trappynges dyght  He darde the dangers of the tourneyd fighte  Within their rests their speeres they set  So furiously ech other met  That  Comptons  well intended speere  Syr John  his shield in pieces tare  And wound his hand in furious geir  Syr Johns  stele Assenglave was wette  Syr John  then toe the marshal turned  His breast with meekle furie burn'd  The tenders of the feelde came in  And bade the Champyons not begyn  Eche tourney but one hour should last  And then one hour was gone and past  END OF THE FYRST CANTO  IN IMITATION OF OUR OLD POETS ON OURE LADYES CHIRCH    IN auntient dayes when Kenewalchyn King  Of all the borders of the sea did

Where the loud Tyger pawing in his rage  Bids the black Archers of the wilds engage  Stretch'd on the sand two panting Warriors lay  In all the burning torments of the day  Their bloody jav'lins reek'd on living steem  Their bows were broken at the roaring stream  Heccar the Chief of Jarra's fruitful Hill  Where the dark vapours nightly dews distill  Saw Gaira the companion of his soul

revenge denies  O could I throw my javlin from my eyes  HECCAR  When Gaira the united armies broke  Death wing'd the arrow Death impell'd the stroke  See pil'd in mountains on the sanguine sand  The blasted of the lightnings of thy hand  Search the brown desart and the glossy green  There are the trophies of thy valour seen  The scatter'd bones mantled in silver white  Once animated dared the force  Query whether not intended for foes  in fight  The Children of the Wave whose palid race  Views the faint sun display a languid face  From the red fury of thy justice fled  Swifter than torrents from their rocky bed  Fear with a sicken'd silver ting'd their hue  The guilty fear when vengeance is their due  GAIRA  Rouse not Remembrance from her shad'wy cell  Nor of those bloody sons of mischief tell  Cawna O Cawna deck'd in sable charms  What distant region holds thee from my arms  Cawna the pride of Afric's sultry vales  Soft as the cooling murmur of the gales  Majestic as the many colour'd Snake  Trailing his glories thro' the blossom'd brake  Black as the glossy rocks where Eascal roars  Foaming thro' sandy wastes to Jaghirs shores  Swift as the arrow hasting to the breast  Was Cawna the companion of my rest  The sun sat low'ring in the Western sky  The swelling tempest spread around the eye  Upon my Cawna's bosom I reclind  Catching the breathing whispers of the wind  Swift from the wood a prowling Tiger came  Dreadful his voice his eyes a glowing flame  I bent the bow the nevererring dart  Pierc'd his rough armour but escap'd his heart  He fled tho' wounded to a distant waste  I urg'd the furious flight with fatal haste  He fell he dy'dspent in the fiery toil  I stripid his carcase of the furry spoil  And as the varied spangles met my eye  On this I cried shall my lov'd Cawna lie  The dusky midnight hung the skies in grey  Impell'd by Love I wing'd the airy way  In the deep valley and the mossy plain  I sought my Cawna but I sought in vain  The pallid shadows of the azure waves  Had made my Cawna and my children slaves  Reflection maddens to recall the hour  The Gods had giv'n me to the Daemon's power  The dusk slow vanish'd from the hated lawn  I gain'd a mountain glaring with the dawn  There the full sails expanded to the wind  Struck horror and distraction in my mind  There Cawna mingled with a worthless train  In common slav'ry drags the hated chain  Now judge my Heccar have I cause for rage  Should aught the thunder of my arm assuage  In everreeking blood this jav'lin dy'd  With vengeance shall be never satisfied  I'll strew the beaches with the mighty dead  And tinge the lily of their features red  HECCAR  When the loud shriekings of the hostile cry  Roughly salute my ear enrag'd I'll fly  Send the sharp arrow quivering thro' the heart  Chill the hot vitals with the venom'd dart  Nor heed the shining steel or noisy smoke  Gaira and Vengeance shall inspire the stroke  CHATTERTON'S WILL    ALL this wrote between and o'clock Saturday in the utmost distress of mind April  N B In a dispute concerning the character of David Mr argued that he must be a holy man from the strains of piety that breathe through his whole worksI being of a contrary opinion and knowing that a great genius can effect any thing endeavouring in the  foregoing  What Poems Chatterton meant here is uncertain  Poems  to represent an enthusiastic Methodist intended to send it to Romaine and impose it upon the infatuated world as a reality but thanks to Burgum's generosity I am now employed in matters of more importance  Saturday April  BURGUM I thank thee thou hast let me see  That Bristol has impress'd her stamp on thee  Thy generous spirit emulates the May'rs  Thy generous spirit with thy Bristols pairs  Gods what would Burgum give to get a name  And snatch his blundering dialect from shame  What would he give to hand his memory down  To times remotest boundaryA Crown  Would you ask more his swelling face looks blue  Futurity he rates at two pound two  Well Burgum take thy laurel to thy brow  With a rich saddle decorate a sow  Strut in Iambics totter in an Ode  Promise and never pay and be the mode  Catcott for thee I know thy heart is good  But ah thy merit's seldom understood  Too bigotted to whimsies which thy youth  Receiv'd to venerate as Gospel truth  Thy friendship never could be dear to me  Since all I am is opposite to thee  If ever obligated to thy purse  Rowley discharges all my first chief curse  For had I never known the antique lore  I ne'er had ventured from my peaceful shore  To be the wreck of promises and hopes  A Boy of Learning and a Bard of Tropes  But happy in my humble sphere had mov'd  Untroubled unsuspected unbelov'd  To Barrett next he has my thanks sincere  For all the little knowledge I had here  But what was knowledge Could it here succeed  When scarcely twenty in the town can read  Could knowledge bring in interest to maintain  The wild expences of a Poets brain  Disinterested Burgum never meant  To take my knowledge for his gain per cent  When wildly squand'ring every thing I got  On Books and Learning and the Lord knows what  Could Burgum then my Critic Patron Friend  Without security attempt to lend  No that would be imprudent in the man  Accuse him of imprudence if you can  He promis'd I confess and seem'd sincere  Few keep an honorary promise here  I thank thee Barrett thy advice was right  But 'twas ordain'd by Fate that I should write  Spite of the prudence of this prudent place  I wrote my mind nor hid the Authors face  Harris ere long when reeking from the Press  My numbers make his selfimportance less  Will wrinkle up his face and damn the day  And drag my body to the triple way  Poor superstitious Mortals wreak your hate  Upon my cold remains  THIS is the last Will and Testament of me Thomas Chatterton of the City of Bristol being sound in body or it is the fault of my last Surgeon the

on the head when he goes to sleep in ChurchMy powers of utterance I give to the Reverend Mr Bn hoping he will employ them to a better purpose than reading Lectures on the Immortality of the Soul I leave the Reverend Mr C some little of  my free thinking that he may put on spectacles of reason and see how vilely he is duped in believing the Scriptures literally I wish he and his brother G would know how far I am their real Enemy but I have an unlucky way of raillery and when the strong fit of Satire is upon me I spare neither friend nor foe This is my excuse for what I have said of them
