DISSERTATION Upon the most Celebrated  Roman POETS  _OF all the Nations in the World the  Romans  have most excelled in the  Art of Poetry  and even among the  Romans  VIRGIL has been the most deservedly celebrated from whom the justest Rules of this Art are rather to be taken than from the dry Precepts of the Criticks To the End therefore that we may the more truly ascertain the  Beauties  and  Faults  which occur among the rest of the Writers of  Heroic Poetry  let us  compare them with the Style of VIRGIL who if he be in any Thing deficient it is when he has sometimes in his  Eclogues  mingled such a Purity of Style as is not entirely agreeable with the Dialect of Shepherds and frequently the Dignity of his Verse seems no way consonant to the Rural Pipe In every Book of his  Georgicks  he treats of  Country Affairs  with an inimitable Elegancy of Style but above all we are most delighted with his last Book  Of the Nature of  BEES where in a Poem on so inconsiderable a Subject our Author purposely affects a peculiarly solemn and pompous Style In this Piece he compares the Labours of the BEES to those of the  Cyclops  and in the same lofty Numbers recounts the Skirmishes of these little  Insects  among themselves as he does the  Rencounters of AENEAS and TURNUS All along the Generals of this small Republick the Populace the Factions the Customs and Forms of Government exercised within the narrow Limits of the  Beehive  are described with an inexpressible Beauty and Magnificence Throughout the whole Work what mostly raises our Admiration is that in the Persuit of his Discourse on Planting Grazing and Agriculture waving the common Forms of Speech he suits his Poetick Diction to so unpolite a Theme how seemingly depressed with the Meanness of his Subject he never sinks into a  Plebeian  Style but the Force and Energy of his Expression are so conspicuous that many too rashly indeed have not scrupled to prefer the  Georgicks  to the  Aeneid  But in  a Work of this Nature no other Parts of Poetry could be displayed except an Elegance of Style and Description In both these Ways VIRGIL has this peculiar to himself that he captivates the Soul with his wonderful Sweetness and his Descriptions are as Lively as if we had the Object placed before our Eyes  In the Purity of his Style next follows LUCRETIUS whose Diction allowing for his Obsoleteness and Numbers almost Prosaick may challenge a Share of Praise in those who have any Taste of the  Roman Eloquence  For Descriptions however the second Post of Honour is due to CLAUDIAN who has throughout in a most beautiful Style interwoven his agreeable Images faulty in this alone that  he expatiates upon his Subjects beyond all Decency and frequently gives us the same Thoughts diversified only in Expression CLAUDIAN well knew what a Master he was in this Art for on whatsoever Topick he is engaged he diligently searches out Matter for Description nay most of the Subjects he has wrote upon are wholly such as may be seen in his  Prefaces  his  Eclogues  his Books of the  Rape of  PROSERPINE his  Phoenix  his  Porcupine  his  Crampfish  and most of his EPIGRAMS  OVID like a true Courtier as he was describes the Affairs of  Love  in neat and polite Verse In the rest of his Works we meet with the more vulgar Way of Expression for trusting  to a good Genius he was little soli  itous about forming a more elaborate Stile but yet in his  Metamorphoses  he has Painted in the greatest Perfection the various  Changes  of all Creatures and the  Transformations  proceed in a most easy and gradual manner  STATIUS has frequently discharged both these Requisites of a Poet we just now observed LUCAN neither whose Diction altho' very bombast is not enlivened either by beautiful Phrases or Epithets but comes nearer Prose than Poetry nay there is in him commonly such a mean Choice of Words as is sometimes even beneath Profe itself And although he abounds in Descriptions and is always making Excursions of that Kind yet he seldom finishes his  Work as he ought or brings his Thoughts to any Justness of Conclusion  But now as to STATIUS he has given us Compositions worthy of the Envy of the best Poets But with all his Beauties he has greater Faults for in his Expression he makes too much use of Gigantick Words and not considering his Subject mingles useless Thunder in his Numbers Nor is he less faulty in his Descriptions for encouraging too great a Heat while he attempts to excel he shoots beyond his Mark and swells unnaturally Of both which Extreams CLAUDIAN is too often guilty  And now since there have been many Pieces written and those of Note  on the Subject of VIRGIL's  Aeneis  and less notice is taken of the Poetry of STATIUS and LUCAN to whose Productions only the  Latins  allow the Title of  Epick Poetry  As to LUCAN it has been often disputed whether  History  of which the  Pharsalia  consists be a proper Subject for an  Heroick Poem  For the Decision of this Point we must enquire into the true Nature of  Heroick Poetry  which our Countryman the Lord BACON has admirably described in his Treatise of  The Advancement of Learning  "As for  Narrative Poesie  or if you please  Heroical  so you understand it of the Matter not of the Verse it seems to be raised altogether from a noble Foundation which makes much for the Dignity of Man's Nature  For seeing this sensible World is in Dignity inferior to the Soul of Man  Poesie  seems to endow human Nature with that which  History  denies and to give Satisfaction to the Mind with at least the Shadow of Things where the Substance cannot be had For if the Matter be thoroughly considered a strong Argument may be drawn from  Poesie  that a more stately greatness of Things a more perfect Order and a more beautiful Variety delights the Soul of Man than any Way can be found in Nature since the  Fall  Wherefore seeing the Acts and Events which are the Subject of true  History  are not of that Amplitude as to content the Mind of Man  Poesie  is ready at Hand to feign Acts more  Heroical  Because  True History  reports the Successes of Business not proportionable to the Merit of Virtues and Vices  Poesie  corrects it and presents Events and Fortunes according to Desert and according to the Law of Providence Because  True History  thro' the frequent Satiety and Similitude of Things works a Distaste and Misprision in the Mind of Man  Poesie  cheereth and refresheth the Soul chaunting Things rare and various and full of Vicissitudes So as  Poesie  serveth and conferreth to Delectation Magnanimity and Morality and therefore it may seem deservedly to have some Participation of Divineness because it accommodates its Images and Descriptions to the utmost Desire and Wish of the Soul  not subjecting the Mind to Things or Facts as  Reason  and  History  do"  From whence it is sufficiently manifest that  History  and  Epick Poetry  are by no means proper Companions and therefore that LUCAN has very much failed in his principal Subject The five Heroes who make the greatest Figure in his Poem are CAESAR POMPEY BRUTUS CATO and CICERO each of them indeed as distinguishable in their Lives as to be lamented in their Deaths Men whose Virtues allowing for the Frailties of Human Nature came nearest to that Pitch of Heroick Perfection which other Poets have falsely attributed to their Heroes LUCAN every where snarls at CAESAR and passionately espouses POMPEY's Interest but most of all celebrates  the Characters of BRUTUS and CATO for that Spirit of  Stoicism  which he had equally imbibed with them And indeed most of the Faults objected to LUCAN are rather to be imputed to this Kind of Philosophy From whence sprung that boundless Vein of Wit and that peculiar Affectation of a lofty Style which like that Sect of Men he always delighted in and therefore gives the Preference rather to Great than Good Actions And upon this Account in raising the Passions that most excellent Part of Poetry he succeeded but ill because upon the Principles of his Philosophy the Passions themselves were accounted as absolutely unlawful To confirm this passing by many others I will produce but one Instance After CAESAR  had obtained the Victory over POMFEY in the Battle of  Pharsalia  LUCAN certainly if he had enlarged on any Circumstance foreign to History it self should upon so remarkable an Occasion have lamented the undeserved Fate of POMPEY in the most mournful Strain especially since he pays so high a Deference to him throughout his whole Work or at least as there was an open Field for Grief he should have introduced POMPEY either complaining of  Rome  's lost Liberty the Death of his Friends or his own Misfortunes But LUCAN is so far from raising the Passions to this just Heighth that he warmly advises POMPEY when vanquished he retires from the Field of Action to commiserate the Condition of his Conqueror CAESAR  because he had not won the Day but by unjustifiable Methods  Don't you rejoice that your superiour Foes  Have snatch'd you from a Scene of future Woes  That blest in Exile you escape the Sight  Of Armies bleeding in domestick Fight  Behold each River drags her tardy Flood  Choak'd up with Carnage and distain'd with Blood  Your  VictorSire  with pitying Eyes survey  Nor envy him the Fortune of the Day  How shall he enter  Rome  devoid of Shame  Who on the publick Ruins builds his Name  Who can bear to hear the Poet Philosophizing in this ridiculous Manner As if POMPEY a Man in Years an Exile Miserable and Vanquished should have any Concern upon him for the Crimes of his Conqueror He ought to have been very much stoicized indeed who despoiled of all the Goods of Fortune could place the Sum of his Felicity in meer naked Virtue But none of the Poets have touched this Passion of  Grief  like VIRGIL The Generality of other Writers when they attempt to move their Readers offend in this Point that they are too prolix in spinning out their Complaints and think their Flood of Tears inexhaustible or else while they labour to express the Greatness of their Genius in the Profuseness of their Verse rather  raise our Admiration at the Flowing of their Numbers than excite our Pity in the Catastrophe of their Story VIRGIL has carefully avoided both these Extreams and dresses his Images of Sorrow in their Native Simplicity and whereever he touches upon the Pathetick he does it with a masterly quickness For according to CICERO  Our expressions of Grief ought to be short and concise because our Tears quickly dry up and it is unnatural to detain either an Auditor or Reader in too long a Suspension of Grief  But to return to STATIUS his Spirit is indeed lofty and aspiring to which while he gives too great a Loose he runs into Bombast and to his Poetry often adds useless sounding Words The Subject of his  Thebais  seems indeed suited to the Barbarity of his Genius but is beneath the Dignity of an Heroick Poem For neither ETEOCLES POLYNICES nor TYDEUS whose Actions are recorded in this Poem have any thing in them except their Fortitude agreeable to Heroes Nay throughout the whole Piece there are no Examples produc'd unless of Persons infamous for the most flagitious Enormities such as Parricide Treachery Cruelty and Revenge while on the contrary every Thing Praiseworthy shines bright in VIRGIL's Heroes and in the Person of AENEAS we have plac'd before our Eyes an Instance of consummate Piety towards the GOD's his Son his Wife his Friends and his Father The Epithets of STATIUS are generally  forced and very metaphorical while such Properties are ascribed to Inanimates as really only belong to Animals In the Choice of his Words and frequently in his Metaphors he is followed by CLAUDIAN with the utmost Elegance VIRGIL is sparing in both these Particulars STATIUS abounds much with Similitudes in which he seems to imitate VIRGIL but in this Instance LUCAN had had better Success if he had hit upon the proper Medium But while VIRGIL stoops down to the humble Subjects of  Bees Ants  and other such like delightful Themes of Nature on the other Hand LUCAN bellows out nothing but Stories of  Oaks  split by Lightening  Earthquakes  and the World's  Conflagration  Let this in short suffice  observable concerning the Writers of Heroic Poetry in itself New and never before taken Notice of  Something now remains to be said of the  Satyrists  among whom whether JUVENAL or HORACE have most Right to the  Bays  it is dfficult to determine for it has been long a Dispute among the Learned whether that Keenness and Bitterness of Expression with which JUVENAL has armed his  Satires  or HORACE's more jocose  Lampoons  are most agreeable to the End of SATIRE Now that we may give a clearer Decision on this Head a few Things must be premised HORACE bears to this Day an ill Character for the Looseness of his Conduct in Life JUVENAL was a rigid  Practiser of Virtue The one was conversant in the most perfectly polite Court of AUGUSTUS the other lived in the Dregs of DOMITIAN's Time and therefore both these Poets accommodated their Writings to the Manners of the different Ages they lived in For HORACE is intirely upon the ludicrous and persues not so much the Licentiousness of the Times as the ridiculous Fopperies of some particular Courtiers for had he attempted to correct these Trifles with Severity he had not missed of being laughed at But JUVENAL lashes the grossest Crimes prevalent in his Time and complains of Enormities which one would be ashamed to mention and nothing less than the highest Resentmemt of Soul Ardency of Expression and Sharpness  of Speech could be an equal Match to Crimes so notorious though whenever he descends to be  jocose  we frequently meet with the Pleasantry of HORACE Both of them allowing for the different Manner of their Writing are perfect Masters in their several Ways in the one the  Ridicule  appears better than the  Severe  in the other the  Severe  better than the  Ridicule  The rest of HORACE's Pieces are so admirable that they exceed our highest Encomiums and are not only beyond our Dislike but above our Praise  As to what concerns the Dramatic  Poets  PLAUTUS and TERENCE bear away the Bell whose Plots Turns and Elegancy of Style are so well known that nothing New can be said upon them  As ro SENECA Mankind have had different Opinions of him some have ranked him with the best  Tragoedians  others have sunk him below the worst He certainly had a great Genius an elegant and concise Way of Expression he abounds with smart Turns which always savour much of that Stoicism of which he was a Follower upon which Account he has always been esteemed by those who have had little or no Taste of  Dramatic Poetry  but then if we consider him as such his Tragedies are throughout too elaborate and this to pass by his other Faults seems peculiarly SENECA's that he makes all his Actors without any Regard to the Characters they bear talk in the same Strain all of  them inculcate rigid philosophical  Dogmata  and such Morality as is rather fit for the Schools of the Stoicks than the  Roman  Theatre For with him the King and the Slave strut in the same Buskin nay you may perceive the Nurse herself deeply tinged with the Principles of Stoicism  Among the  Epigrammatists  MARTIAL and CLAUDIAN have bore the greatest Reputaion the first for the severe Point in the Close of his  Epigrams  and the peculiar Jingle of his Words The other for dispersing the Poignancy of his Wit throughout his  Epigrams  and that in the most beautiful  Latin  Phrase  The rest of the  lower Class  of the  Latin  Poets creep so low in their Numbers that they are beneath the Notice either of GODS or Men And tho' we may now and then discover in the affected Songs and Sonnets of CATULLUS and the obscene POETRY of TIBULLUS and PROPERTIUS some not disagreeable Pieces yet it is not worth our while to rake the  Dunghills  for the sake of the JEWELS  TENTAMEN De POETIS  Romanis  ELEGIACIS  _SAepe Mecum ipse mirari soleo Ex tot tantisque viris in Antiquâ classicorum Poetarum

in  Translating  the Ancient  Classick  POETS so Few have thought the  Writers  of ELEGY Worthy their Pains or Amusement I cannot but Believe that  These  have succeeded as happily in their Way as the  Others  and that They may be Read with no less  Advantage  than  Pleasure  For my own Part I can affirm that when at any time my Mind hath been ruffled by some  peevish Accident  or  Disappointment  I have always found my temper sooner Composed by taking a Turn with  TIBULLUS  in my Hand than by having recourse to the  Lessons  of PHILOSOPHY or the  Precepts  of DIVINES Whatever is very  solemn  carrieth with it I don't know how somewhat of  Constraint  And it frequently happens by an unlucky Disposition either in the  Pupil  or the  Preacher  that  Those severer  Kinds of  Discipline  I speak not This with the least Irreverence serve rather to  Punish  than  Reform  Us It  is perhaps no Difficult Matter to  Convince  One of the  Reasonableness  of This or That Action but the Secret lies in  Engaging  One in the  Practice  It is a  Memorable Sentence  of a  Celebrated  MORALIST  This  Virtus est vitium fugere Sapientia prima  Stultitiâ caruisse  Horat  "It is the  Beginning  of VIRTUE to  Depart  from VICE and the  First Step  towards WISDOM is to  Forsake  our FOLLY"  May it not as justly be said The  First Step  towards HAPPINESS is to  Forget  our MISERY The best Method to bring  That  about is not I presume by  Alarming  the THINKING FACULTY but by  Soothing  and  Lulling  to  Rest  our  too Active  and  Unquiet  REFLECTIONS  WHILST  Our poor tottering  BARK continues in This Uncertain  Voyage  of Life and is so often kept out at  Sea  in  rough  and  stormy Weather  far from the sight of any  Hospitable Shoar  the SOUL its PASSENGER cannot sure but feel a  mighty Satisfaction  arising within when she finds Herself afterwads  Stealing  as it were away under  smoother Courses  and born  gently  down the  Tide  of TENDERNESS in  soft  and  easie Gales  of PASSION  THERE is a  Charm  in VERSE that never fails  agreeably  to Affect a  Heart  that is  rightly plac'd  And there is in my Opinion something  peculiarly moving  in the VERSES of That  Goodnatured Class  of POETS  CATULLUS TIBULLUS PROPERTIUS  and  OVID  There are but  Few Pieces  of  CATULLUS  it is true that can strictly be ranked among  Those  of the ELEGIAC ORDER But whenever HE doth Touch upon the  softer Subjects  of HUMANITY his  Sentiments  have the utmost  Propriety  and  Delicacy  and therefore I could not but mention HIM among  His Companions  They were  All Four  Men of  Family  and  Condition  in their Country Their  Inclinations  led Them naturally to PLEASURE and Their  Good Sense  to a Discovery of the  Knavery  of BUSINESS and the  Vanity  of AMBITION The  Three Former  may be said to have Been as  Extraordinary  a  TRIUMVIRATE  as perhaps any Age hath Produced I mean in an  Idle Way  of Life  Polite  in their MANNERS  Easie  in Their FORTUNES  Successful  in Their AMOURS  Happy  in  each Other's  ACQUAINTANCE  Beloved  in general while they LIVED and Universally  Lamented  when They DIED As for  OVID  He was certainly Master of all the  fine Qualities  and  Accomplishments  that could be desired in a GENTLEMAN But having Offended  AUGUSTUS  either by Happening to be an  Unexpected Witness  of that EMPEROR's  LoveIntrigues  or else by too  lasciviously  Describing  His Own  which was the  Crime  Pretended He was  Banished  from  ITALY  in his  Fiftieth  Year and Languished out the Remainder of His Days at  TAMOS  the Modern  TEMESWAER  as some think There are I believe but two Instances in Story of a  Punishment  like  This  for What at the worst could  be called  only  an  Indiscretion  One in the Person of  OVID  The Other in That of  RABUTIN  Their  Masters  were equally  Absolute  equally  Wise  and equally  Jealous  FROM this Little Draught of  Their Characters  One may judge how  Edifying  any of  Their Compositions  must needs be to an  Elegant Understanding  And indeed What  Sincerity  in FRIENDSHIP What  Fondness  in LOVE What  Kindness  to RELATIONS What  Instances  of  all the Social  VIRTUES do We not meet with in Their Writings Not to mention a thousand Ornaments of  Wit  a wonderful  Sweetness  and easy  Cadence  in their  Numbers  and so True a  Picture  of Life that one can scarce Fancy the  Scene  to lye at the  Distance  it is placed  THERE is One  Objection  which I must not pass over and that is generally charged upon  These  POETS Imean Their too great  License  and  Obscenity  in Their  Ideas  and  Language  To This I would Reply That if upon some Occasions They seem not to have been very  Scrupulous  about the  Terms  They made use of in Communicating their  Amorous Adventers  it ought not to be imputed to a  Scandalous Singularity  in THEM but to the  Common  Indulgence  of the AGE in which They Flourished  HORACE  must Plead  Guilty  to the  same Indictment  Nay  VIRGIL  Himself as Applauded as HE is for  Modesty  hath left many  Expressions  in his ECLOGUES that might be Argued of  Wantonness  After All the whole Matter will turn upon this Single Point A Person whose  Principles  are  Uncorrupted  may freely Converse with  These  AUTHORS without Danger of  Infection  And for Such who have more  Wickedness  than  Wit  the greatest  Curse  that can befal a FOOL their  sensless Vice  will tempt Them to Pervert even the most  Sacred Things  to the  vilest Purposes  However though  All  their POEMS may be  Read  in the  Originals  with  Safety  I do not pretend to say They can  All  be  Translated  with  Decency  But since Many of Them may it is Pity I think We have not More of Them in ENGLISH to Enrich our Language with a Variety of  Pleasing Images  that are as  Innocent  as they are  Delightful  THERE is  One Difficulty  that will still lye upon the Hands of Any who shall Undertake this Work and  This  ariseth from their frequent  Allusions  to the  Ceremonies  ând  Notions  of Their RELIGION  Instances  of This abound even in  Those Copies  of their Verses that are writ the most in the  Spirit  of LEWDNESS As SUEPRSTITION hath ever been an  Especial Bawd  to LUST But for All such as are Proper to be  Translated  they may be Rendered by  a few  Explanatory Notes  not only  Intelligible  but very  Entertaining  to a  mere  ENGLISH  Reader  FINIS
