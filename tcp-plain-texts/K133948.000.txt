 THE DECLINE FALL OF  THE ENGLISH SYSTEM  OF FINANCE  BY THOMAS PAINE AUTHOR OF COMMON SENSE AMERICAN CRISIS AGE OF REASON  c  On the verge nay even in the gulph of Bankruptcy  Debates in Parliament  SECOND AMERICAN EDITION  NEWYORK  PRINTED BY WILLIAM A DAVIS FOR J FELLOWS  From a London Copy of the Paris Edition    THE DECLINE c  NOTHING they say is more cer∣tain than death and nothing more un∣certain than the time of dying yet we can always fix a period beyond which man cannot live and within some mo∣ments of which he will die We are enabled to do this not by any spirit of prophesy or foresight into the event but by observation of what has happened in all cases of human or animal existence If then any other subject such for in∣stance as a system of finance exhibits in its progress a series of symptoms in∣dicating decay its final dissolution is certain and the period of it can be calculated from the symptoms it exhibits  Those who have hitherto written on the English system of finance the sun∣ding  system have been uniformly im∣pressed with the idea of its downfal hap∣pening  some time or other  They took however no data for that opinion but expressed it predictively or merely as opinion from a conviction that the per∣petual duration of such a system was a natural impossibility It is in this man∣ner that Dr Price has spoken of it and Smith in his  Wealth of Nations  has spo∣ken in the same manner that is mere∣ly as opinion without data "The pro∣gress" says Smith  of the enor∣mous debts which at present oppress and will in the longrun  most probably ruin  all the great nations of Europe he should have said  governments  has been pretty uniform  But this ge∣neral manner of speaking though it might make some impression carried with it no conviction  It is not my intention to predict any thing but I will shew from data already known from symptoms and facts which the English funding system has already exhibited publicly that it will not con∣tinue to the end of Mr Pitt's life suppo∣sing  him to live the usual life of a man How much sooner it may fall I leave to others to predict  Let financiers diversify systems of cre∣dit as they will it is nevertheless true that every system of credit is a system of paper money Two experiments have already been had upon paper money the one in America the other in France In both those cases the whole capital was emitted and that whole capital which in America was called continental money and in France assignats appeared in cir∣culation the consequence of which was that the quantity became so enormous and so disproportioned to the quantity of population and to the quantity of objects upon which it could be employ∣ed that the market if I may so ex∣press it was glutted with it and the value of it fell Between five and six years de∣termined the fate of those experiments The same fate would have happened to gold and silver could gold and silver have been issued in the same abundant manner as paper had been and confined in the country as paper money always is by hav∣ing  no circulation out of it or to speak on a larger scale the same thing would hap∣pen in the world could the world be glut∣ted with gold and silver as America and France has been with paper  The English system differs from that of America and France in this one par∣ticular that its capital is kept out of sight that is it does not appear in cir∣culation Were the whole capital of the national debt which at the time I write this is almost four hundred mil∣lion pounds sterling to be emitted in as∣signats or bills and that whole quantity put into circulation as was done in Ame∣rica and in France those English assign∣ats or bills would sink in value as those of America and France have done and that in a greater degree because the quantity of them would be more dispro∣portioned to the quantity of population in England than was the case in either of the other two countries A nominal pound sterling in such bills would not be worth one penny  But though the English system by thus keeping the capital out of sight is  preserved from hasty destruction as i  the case of America and France it ne∣vertheless approaches the same fate and will arrive at it with the same certainty though by a slower progress The dif∣ference is altogether in the degree of speed by which the two systems ap∣proach their fate which to speak in round numbers is as twenty is to one that is the English system that of fund∣ing the capital instead of issuing it con∣tained within itself a capacity of endur∣ing twenty times longer than the system adopted by America and France and at the end of that time it would arrive at the same common grave the Potter's field of paper money  The datum I take for this proportion of twenty to one is the difference be∣tween a capital and the interest at five per cent Twenty times the interest is equal to the capital The accumulation of paper money in England is in propor∣tion to the accumulation of the interest upon every new loan and therefore the progress to dissolution is twenty times slower than if the capital were to be emitted and put into circulation imme∣diately  Every twenty years in the English system is equal to one year in the French and American systems  The English funding system began one hundred years ago in which time there has been six wars including the war that ended in  The war that ended as I have just said in  The war that began in  The war that began in  The war that began in  The American war that began in  The present war that began in  The national debt at the conclusion of the war which ended in was twentyone millions and an half See Smith's Wealth of Nations chapter on Public Debts We now see it ap∣proaching fast to four hundred millions If between those two extremes of twen∣tyone millions and four hundred millions embracing the several expences of all the including wars there exists some common ratio that will ascertain arith∣metically the amount of the debt at the  end of each war as certainly as the fact is now known to be that ratio will in like manner determine what the amount of the debt will be in all future wars and will ascertain the period within which the funding system will expire in a bankruptcy of the government for the ratio I allude to is the ratio which the nature of the thing has established for itself  Hitherto no idea has been entertain∣ed that any such ratio existed or could exist that could determine a problem of this kind that is that could ascer∣tain without having any knowledge of the fact what the expence of any for∣mer war had been or what the expence of any future war would be but it is nevertheless true that such a ratio does exist as I shall shew and also the mode of applying it  The ratio I allude to is not in Arith∣metical progression like the numbers nor yet in geometrical progression like the numbers  but is in the series of one half upon each preceding number like the num∣bers  Any person can perceive that the se∣cond number is produced by the preceding number and half and that the third number is in like man∣ner produced by the preceding number and half and so on for the rest They can also see how rapidly the sums increase as the ratio proceeds The dif∣ference between the two first numbers is but four but the difference between the two last is fortyfive and from thence they may see with what immense rapidity the national debt has increased and will continue to increase till it exceeds the ordinary powers of calculation and loses itself in cyphers  I come now to apply the ratio as a rule to determine all the cases  I begin with the war that ended in which was the war in which the funding system began The expence of that war was twentyone millions and an half In order to ascertain the expence of the next  war I add to twentyone millions and an half the half thereof ten millions and three quarters which makes thirtytwo millions and a quarter added to the former debt of twentyone millions and an half carries the national debt to fiftythree mil∣lions and three quarters Smith in his chapter on Public Debts says Thenation∣al debt was at this time fiftythree millions  I proceed to ascertain the expence of the next war that of by adding as in the former case one half to the ex∣pence of the preceeding war The ex∣pence of the preceding war was thirtytwo millions and a quarter for the sake of even numbers say thirtytwo millions the half of which makes fortyeight millions for the expence of that war  I proceed to ascertain the expence of the war of by adding according to the ratio one half to the expence of the preceding war The expence of the pre∣ceding war was taken at millions the half of which makes millions for the expence of that war Smith chap∣ter on public debts says the expence of  the war of was millions and a quarter  I proceed to ascertain the expence of the American war of by adding as in the former cases one half to the ex∣pence of the preceding war The ex∣pence of the preceding war was millions the half of which makes milli∣ons for the expence of that war In the last edition of Smith chapter on Public Debts he says the expence of the Ame∣rican war was  more than an hundred mil∣lions  I come now to ascertain the expence of the present war supposing it to conti∣nue as long as former wars have done and the funding system not to break up before that period The expence of the preced∣ing war was millions he half of which makes millions for the ex∣pence of the present war It gives symp∣toms of going beyond this sum supposing the funding system not to break up for the loans of the last year and of the pre∣sent year are twentytwo millions each which exceeds the ratio compared with the loans of the preceding war It will  not be from the inability of procuring loans that the system will break up On the contrary it is the facility with which loans can be procured that hastens that event The loans are altogether paper transactions and it is the excess of them that brings on with the accelerating speed that progressive depreciation of funded paper money that will dissolve the funding system  I proceed to ascertain the expence of fu∣ture wars and I do this merely to shew the impossibility of the continuance of the fund∣ing system and the certainty of its disso∣lution  The expence of the next war after the present war according to the ratio that has ascertained the preceding cases will be  millions  Expence of the second war millions  third war millions  fourth war millions  fifth war millions  millions  which at only per cent will require taxes to the nominal amount of one hun∣dred  and twentyeight millions to pay the annual interest besides the interest of the present debt and the expences of govern∣ment which are not included on this ac∣count Is there a man so mad so stupid as to suppose this system can continue  When I first conceived the idea of seek∣ing for some common ratio that should ap∣ply as a rule of measurement to all the ca∣ses of the funding system so far as to ascer∣tain the several stages of its approach to dissolution I had no expectation that any ratio could be found that would apply with so much exactness as this does I was led to the idea merely by observing that the funding system was a thing in con∣tinual progression and that whatever was in a state of progression might be suppo∣sed to admit of at least some general ratio of measurement that would apply without any very great variation But who could have supposed that falling sys∣tems or falling opinions admitted of a ratio apparently as true as the descent of falling bodies I have not made the ra∣tio any more than Newton made the ra∣tio of gravitation I have only discovered  it and explained the mode of applying it To shew at one view the rapid progres∣sion of the funding system to destruction and to expose the folly of those who blind∣ly believe in its continuance or who art∣fully endeavour to impose that belief upon others I exhibit in the annexed table the expence of each of the six wars since the funding system began as ascertained by the ratio and the expence of six wars yet to come ascertained by the ratio  First six wars    millions    millions    millions    millions  The actual expence of the war of did not come up to the sum ascertained by the ratio But as that which is the natural disposition of a thing as it is the natural disposition of a stream of water to de∣scend will if impeded in its course overcome by a new effort what it had lost by that impediment so it was with respect to this war and the next taken collectively for the expence of the war restored the equilibrium of the ratio as fully as if it had not been impeded A circumstance that serves to prove the truth of the ratio more fully than if the interruption had not taken place The war of was languid the efforts were below the value of mo∣ney at that time for the ratio is the measure of the depreciation of money in consequence of the fund∣ding system or what comes to the same end it is the measure of the increase of paper Every additional quantity of it whether in bank notes or otherwise diminishes the  real  though not the  nominal  value of the former quantity    millions    millions    Total  millions  Second six wars    millions    millions    millions    millions    millions    millions    Total  millions  Those who are acquainted with the power with which even a small ratio act∣ing in progression multiplies in a long series will see nothing to wonder at in this table Those who are not acquaint∣ed with that subject and not knowing what else to say may be inclined to deny it But it is not their opinion one way nor mine the other that can influence the event The table exhibits the natural march of the sunding system to its irre∣deemable dissolution Supposing the pre∣sent government of England to continue and to go on as it has gone on since the funding system began I would not give twenty shillings for one hundred pounds in the funds to be paid twenty years hence I do not speak this predictively I produce the data upon which that belief is founded and which data it is every  body's interest to know who have any thing to do with the funds or who are going to bequeath property to their de∣scendants to be paid at a future day  Perhaps it may be asked that as go∣vernments or ministers proceeded by no ratio in making loans or incurring debts and as nobody intended any ratio or thought of any how does it happen that there is one I answer that the ratio is founded in necessity and I now go to ex∣plain what that necessity is  It will always happen that the price of labour or of the produce of labour be that produce what it may will be in pro∣portion to the quantity of money in a country admitting things to take their natural course Before the invention of the funding system there was no other money than gold and silver and as na∣ture gives out those metals with a sparing hand and in regular annual quantities from the mines the several prices of things were proportioned to the quantity of money at that time and so nearly sta∣tionary as to vary but little in any fifty or sixty years of that period  When the funding system began a sub∣stitute for gold and silver began also That substitute was paper and the quan∣tity of it increased as the quantity of inte∣rest increased upon accumulated loans This appearance of a new and additional species of money in the nation soon began to break the relative value which money and the things it will purchase bore to each other before Every thing rose in price but the rise at first was little and slow like the difference in units between the two first numbers and compared with the two last numbers and in the table It was however sufficient to make itself considerably felt in a large transaction When therefore government by engaging in a new war required a new loan it was obliged to make a higher loan than the former loan to balance the increased price to which things had risen and as that new loan increased the quanti∣ty of paper in proportion to the new quan∣tity of interest it carried the price of things still higher than before  The next loan was again higher to balance that further increased price and  all this in the same manner though not in the same degree that every new emission of continental money in America or of assignats in France were greater than the preceding emission to make head against the advance of prices till the com∣bat could be contained no longer Herein is founded the necessity of which I have just spoken That necessity proceeds with accelerating velocity and the ratio I have laid down is the measure of that acceler∣ation or to speak the technical language of the subject it is the measure of the in∣creasing depreciation of funded paper money and of banknotes continues to multiply What else but this can account for the difference between one war's cost∣ing millions and another war's costing millions  The difference cannot be accounted for on the score of extraordinary efforts or extraordinary atchievements The war that cost millions was the war of the confederates historically called the grand alliance consisting of England Austria and Holland in the time of William the Third against Louis the Fourteenth and  in which the confederates were victorious The present is a war of much greater confederacya confederacy of England Austria Prussia the German Empire Spain Holland Naples and Sardinia eight powers against the French Republic singly and the Republic has beaten the whole confederacy But to return to my subject  It is said in England that the value of paper keeps equal with the value of gold and silver But the case is not rightly stated for the fact is that the paper has  pulled down  the value of gold and silver to a level with itself Gold and silver will not purchase so much of any purchasable article at this day as if no paper had ap∣peared nor so much as it will in any country in Europe where there is no pa∣per How long this hanging together of money and paper will continue makes a new case because it daily exposes the system to sudden death independent of the natural death it would otherwise suffer  I consider the funding system as being now advanced into the last twenty years  of its existence The single circumstance were there no other that a war should cost  nominally  one hundred and sixty mil∣lions which when the system began cost but twentyone millions or that the loan for one year only including the loan to the Emperor should now be  nominally  greater than the whole expence of that war shews the state of depriciation to which the funding system has arrived Its depreciation is in the proportion of eight for one compared with the value of its money when the system began which is the state the French assignats stood in a year ago March com∣pared with gold and silver It is there∣fore that I say that the English funding system has entered into the last twenty years of its existence Comparing each twenty years of the English system with every single year of the American and French systems as before stated  Again supposing the present war to close as former wars have done and with∣out producing either revolution or reform in England another war at least must be looked for in the space of the twenty  years I allude to for it has never yet happened that twenty years have passed off without a war and that more especi∣ally since the English government has dabbled in German politics and shewn a disposition to insult the world and the world of commerce with her navy That next war will carry the national debt to very nearly seven hundred millions the interest of which at four per cent will be twentyeight millions besides the taxes for the then expences of govern∣ment which will increase in the same pro∣portion and which will carry the taxes to at least millions and if another war only begins it will quickly carry them to above fifty for it is in the last twenty years of the funding system as in the last year of the American and French systems without funding that all the great shocks begin to operate  I have just mentioned that paper in England has  pulled down  the value of gold and silver to a level with itself and that this  pulling down  of gold and silver money has created the appearance of paper mo∣ney's keeping up The same thing and  the same mistake took place in America and in France and continued for a consi∣derable time after the commencment of their system of paper and the actual depreciation of money was hidden under that mistake  It was said in America at that time that every thing was becoming  dear  but gold and silver could then buy those dear articles no cheaper than paper could and therefore it was not called depreciation The idea of  dearness  established itself for the idea of depreciation The same was the case in France Though every thing rose in price soon after assignats appeared yet those dear articles could be purchased no cheaper with gold and silver than with paper and it was only said that things were  dear  The same is still the language in England They call it  dearness  but they will soon find that it is an actual de∣preciation and that this depreciation is the effect of the funding system which by crowding such a continually increasing mass of paper into circulation carries down the value of gold and silver with it  But gold and silver will in the long run revolt against depreciation and separate from the value of paper for the progress of all such systems appears to be that the paper will take the command in the beginning and gold and silver in the end  But this succession in the command of gold and silver over paper makes a crisis far more eventful to the funding system than to any other system upon which pa∣per can be issued for strictly speaking it is not a crisis of danger but a symptom of death It is a death stroke to the fun∣ding system It is a revolution in the whole of its affairs  If paper be issued without being fund∣ed upon interest emissions of it cannot be continued after the value of it sepa∣rates from gold and silver as we have seen in the two cases of America and France But the funding system rests altogether upon the value of paper being equal to gold and silver which will be as long as the paper can continue carrying down the value of gold and silver to the same level to which itself descends and no longer But even in this state that of  descending equally together the minister whoever he may be will find himself be∣set with accumulating difficulties because the loans and taxes voted for the service of each ensuing year will wither in his hands before the year expires or before they can be applied This will force him to have recourse to emissions of what are called exchequer and navy bills which by still increasing the mass of paper in circulation will drive on the depreciation still more rapidly  It ought to be known that taxes in En∣gland are not paid in gold and silver but in paper bank notes Every person who pays any considerable quantity of taxes such as malsters brewers distillers I appeal for the truth of it to any of the collectors of excise in England or to Mr Whitbread knows this to be the case There is not gold and silver enough in the nation to pay the taxes in coin as I shall shew and consequently there is not mo∣ney enough in the bank to pay the notes The interest of the national funded debt is paid at the bank in the same kind of pa∣per in which the taxes are collected  When people find as they will find a re∣servedness among each other in giving gold and silver for bank notes or the least preference for the former over the latter they will go for payment to the bank where they have a right to go They will do this as a measure of prudence each one for himself and the truth or delusion of the funding system will then be proved  I have said in the foregoing paragraph that there is not gold and silver enough in the nation to pay the taxes in coin and consequently that there cannot be enough in the bank to pay the notes As I do not choose to rest any thing upon asserti∣on I appeal for the truth of this to the publications of Mr Eden now called Lord Aukland and George Chalmers Secretary to the Board of Trade and Plantation of which Jenkinson now called Lord Hawkesbury is president These sort of folks change their names so often that it is as difficult to know them as it is to know a thief Chalmers gives the quantity of gold and silver coin from the returns of coinage at the mint and af∣ter  deducting for the light gold recoined says that the amount of gold and silver coin is  about twenty millions  He had bet∣ter not have proved this especially if he had reflected that  public credit is suspici∣on asleep  The quantity is much too little  Of this twenty millions which is not a fourth part of the quantity of gold and silver there is in France as is shewn in Mr Neckar's Treatise on the Administra∣tion of the Finances three millions at least must be supposed to be in Ireland some in Scotland and in the WestIndies Newfoundland c The quantity there∣fore in England cannot be more than sixteen millions which is four millions less than the amount of the taxes But ad∣mitting there to be sixteen millions not more than a fourth part thereof four millions can be in London when it is considered that every city town village and farmhouse in the nation must have a part of it and that all the great manu∣factories which most require cash are out of London Of this four millions in London every banker merchant trades∣man  in short every individual must have some He must be a poor shopkeeper indeed who has not a few guineas in his till The quantity of cash therefore in the bank can never on the evidence of circumstances be so much as two milli∣ons most probably not more than one million and on this slender twig always liable to be broken hangs the whole fun∣ding system of four hundred millions be∣sides many millions in bank notes The sum in the bank is not sufficient to pay one fourth of only one years interest of the national debt were the creditors to demand payment in cash or to demand cash for the bank notes in which the in∣terest is paid A circumstance always li∣able to happen  One of the amusements that has kept up the farce of the funding system is that the interest is regularly paid But as the interest is always paid in bank notes and as bank notes can always be coined for the purpose this mode of payment proves nothing The point of proof is can the bank give cash for the bank notes on which the interest is paid If it can  not and it is evident it cannot some mil∣millions of bank notes must go without payment and those holders of bank notes who apply last will be worst off When the present quantity of cash in the bank be paid away it is next to impossible to see how any new quantity is to arrive None will arrive from taxes for the taxes will all be paid in bank notes and should the go∣vernment refuse bank notes in payment of taxes the credit of bank notes will be gone at once No cash will arrive from the busi∣ness of discounting merchants bills for every merchant will pay off those bills in bank notes and not in cash There is therefore no means left for the bank to obtain a new supply of cash after the pre∣sent quantity be paid away But besides the impossibility of paying the interest of the funded debt in cash there are many thousand persons in London and in the country who are holders of bank notes that came into their hands in the fair way of trade and who are not stock holders in the sunds and as such persons have had no hand in increasing the demand upon the bank as those have had who for their  own private interest like Boyd and others are contracting or pretending to contract for new loans they will conceive they have a just right their bank notes should be paid first Boyd has been very sly in France in changing his paper into cash He will be just as sly in doing the same thing in London for he has learned to calculate and then it is probable he will set off for America  A stoppage of payment at the bank is not a new thing Smith in his Wealth of Nations book chap says that in the year exchequer bills fell forty fifty and sixty per cent bank notes twen∣ty per cent and the bank stopt payment That which happened in may hap∣pen again in The period in which it happened was the last year of the war of king William It necessarily put a stop to the further emission of exchequer and navy bills and to the raising of new loans and the peace which took place the next year was probably hurried on by this circumstance and saved the bank from bankruptcy Smith in speaking of the circumstances of the bank upon another  occasion says book chap  This great company has been reduced to the necessity of paying in sixpences  When a bank adopts the expedient of pay∣ing in sixpences it is a confession of in∣solvency  It is worthy of observation that every case of failure in finances since the system of paper began has produced a revolution in governments either total or partial A failure in the finances of France pro∣duced the French revolution A failure in the finance of assignats broke up the revolutionary government and produced the present French Constitution A fai∣lure in the finances of the old Congress of America and the embarrassments it brought upon commerce broke up the system of the old confederation and produced the present federal constitution If then we admit of reasoning by compari∣son of causes and events a failure in the English finances will produce some change in the government of that country  As to Mr Pitt's project of paying off the national debt by applying a million a year for that purpose while he continues  adding more than twenty millions a year to it it is like setting a man with a wood∣en leg to run after a hare The longer he runs the farther he is off  When I said that the funding system had entered the last twenty years of its exist∣ence I certainly did not mean that it would continue twenty years and then ex∣pire as a lease would do I meant to des∣cribe that age of decripitude in which death is every day expected and life can∣not continue long But the death of cre∣dit or that state that is called bankruptcy is not always marked by those progressive stages of visible decline that mark the decline of natural life In the progression of nautral life age annot counterfeit youth nor conceal the departure of juvenile abili∣ties But it is otherwise with respect to the death of credit for though all the approaches to bankruptcy may actually exist in circumstances they admit of being concealed by appearances Nothing is more common than to see the bankrupt of today a man in credit but the day before yet no sooner is the real state of his affairs known than every body can see he had been insolvent long before  In London the greatest theatre of bankrupt∣cy in Europe this part of the subject will be well and feelingly understood  Mr Pitt continually talks of credit and of the national resources These are two of the feigned appearances by which the approaches to bankruptcy are concealed That which he calls credit may exist as I have just shewn in a state of insolvency and is always what I have before described it to be  suspicion asleep  As to national resources Mr Pitt like all the English financiers that pre∣ceded him since the funding system be∣gan has uniformly mistaken the nature of a resource that is they have mista∣ken it consistently with the delusion of the funding system but time is explain∣ing the delusion That which he calls and which they called a resource is not a resource but it is the  anticipation  of a resource They have anticipated what  would have been  a resource in another ge∣neration had not the use of it been so anticipated The funding system is a system of anticipation Those who es∣tablished it an hundred years ago antici∣pated the resources of those who were to  live an hundred years after for the peo∣ple of the present day have to pay the interest of the debts contracted at that time and of all debts contracted since But it is the last feather that breaks the horse's back Had the system began an hundred years before the amount of tax∣es at this time to pay the annual interest at four per cent could we suppose such a system of insanity could have continu∣ed would be two hundred and twenty millions annually for the capital of the debt would be millions according to the ratio that ascertains the expence of the wars for the hundred years that are past But long before it could have reached this period the value of bank notes from the immense quantity of them for it is in paper only that such a nomi∣nal revenue could be collected would have been as low or lower than continental paper money has been in America or assignats in France and as to the idea of exchanging them for gold and silver it is too absurd to be contradicted  Do we not see that nature in all her o∣perations disowns the visionary basis  upon which the funding system is built She acts always by renewed successions and never by accumulating additions per∣petually progressing Animals and ve∣getables men and trees have existed ever since the world began but that ex∣istence has been carried on by successions of generations and not by continuing the same men and the same trees in existence that existed first and to make room for the new she removes the old Every natural idiot can see this It is the stockjobbing idiot only that mistakes He has conceived that art can do what nature cannot He is teaching her a new system that there is not occasion for men to dieThat the scheme of creation can be carried on upon the plan of the funding systemThat it can proceed by continual additions of new beings like new loans and all live together in eter∣nal youth Go count the graves thou idiot and learn the folly of thy arith∣metic  But besides these things there is some∣thing visibly farcical in the whole opera∣tion  of loaning It is scarcely more than four years ago that such a rot of bankrupt∣cy spread itself over London that the whole commercial fabric tottered trade and credit were at a stand and such was the state of things that to prevent or sus∣pend a general bankruptcy the govern∣ment lent the merchants six millions in  go∣vernment  paper and now the merchants lend the government twenty two millions in  their  paper and two parties Boyd and Morgan men but little known con∣tend who shall be the lenders What a farce is this It reduces the operation of loaning to accommodation paper in which the competitors contend not who shall lend but who shall sign because there is something to be got for signing  Every English stockjobber and minis∣ter boasts of the credit of England Its credit say they is greater than that of any country in Europe There is a good reason for this for there is not another country in Europe that could be made the dupe of such a delusion The English funding system will remain a monument of wonder not so much on account of the  extent to which it has been carried as of the folly of believing in it  Those who had formerly predicted that the funding system would break up when the debt should amount to one hundred or one hundred and fifty millions erred only in not distinguishing between insolvency and actual bankruptcy for the insolvency commenced as soon as the government be∣came unable to pay the interest in cash or to give cash for the bank notes in which the interest was paid whether that ina∣bility was known or not or whether it was suspected or not Insolvency always takes place before bankruptcy for bank∣ruptcy is nothing more than the publica∣tion of that insolvency In the affairs of an individual it often happens that insol∣vency exists several years before bankrupt∣cy and that the insolvency is concealed and carried on till the individual is not able to pay one shilling in the pound A government can ward off bankruptcy long∣er than an individual but insolvency will inevitably produce bankruptcy whether in an individual or in a government If then the quantity of bank notes payable  on demand which the bank has issued are greater than the bank can pay off the bank is insolvent and when that insolven∣cy be declared it is bankruptcy  Among the delusions that have been imposed upon the nation by ministers to give a false colouring to its affairs and by none more than by Mr Pitt is a motley amphibious charactered thing called the  balance of trade  This balance of trade as it is cal∣led is taken from the customhouse books in which entries are made of all cargoes exported and also of all cargoes imported in each year and when the value of the exports according to the price set upon them by the exporter or by the customhouse is greater than the value of the imports estimated in the same manner they say the balance of trade is so much in their favour  The customhouse books prove regularly enough that so many cargoes have been exported and so many imported but this is all that they prove or were intended to prove They have nothing to do with the balance of profit or loss and it is ignorance to appeal to them upon that account for the case is that the greater the loss is in any one year the higher will this thing called the balance of trade ap∣pear to be according to the customhouse books For example nearly the whole of the Mediterranean convoy was taken by the French this year conse∣quently those cargoes will not appear as imports on the customhouse books and therefore the balance of trade by which they mean the profits of it will appear to be so much the greater as the loss amounts to and on the other hand had the loss not happen∣ed the profits would have appeared to have been so much the less All the losses happening at sea to returning cargoes by accidents by the elements or by capture make the balance appear the higher on the side of the exports and were they all lost at sea it would appear to be all profit on the customhouse books Also every cargo of exports that is lost that occasions another to be sent adds in like manner to the side of the exports and appears as profit This year the balance of trade will appear high because the losses have been great by capture and by storms The ignorance of the British Par∣liament in listening to this hackneyed imposition of ministers about the balance of trade is astonishing It shews how little they know of national affairs and Mr Grey may as well talk Greek to them as make motions about the state of the nation They understand foxhunting and the gamelaws  I come now to shew the several ways by which bank notes get into circulation I shall afterwards offer an estimate on the total quantity or amount of bank notes ex∣isting at this moment  The bank acts in three capacities As a bank of discount as a bank of deposit and as banker for the government  First as bank of discount The bank discounts merchants bills of exchange for two months When a merchant has a bill that will become due at the end of two months and wants payment before that time that bank advances that payment to  him deducting therefrom at the rate of five per cent per ann The bill of ex∣change remains at the bank as a pledge or pawn and at the end of two months it must be redeemed This transaction is done altogether in paper for the profits of the bank as a bank of discount arise entirely from its making use of paper as money The bank gives bank notes to the merchant in discounting the bill of ex∣change and the redeemer of the bill pays bank notes to the bank in redeeming it It very seldom happens that the real mo∣ney passes between them  If the profits of a bank be for example two hundred thousand pounds a year a great sum to be made merely by exchang∣ing one sort of paper for another and which shews also that the merchants of that place are pressed for money for pay∣ments instead of having money to spare to lend to government it proves that the bank discounts to the amount annually or l every two months and there never remains in the bank more than two months pledge of the value of l at any one time the amount  of bank notes in circulation at any one time should not be more than to that a∣mount This is sufficient to shew that the present immense quantity of bank notes which are distributed through e∣very city town village and farmhouse in England cannot be accounted for on the score of discounting  Secondly as a bank of deposit To deposit money at the bank means to lodge it there for the sake of convenience and to be drawn out at any moment the de∣positer pleases or to be paid away to his order When the business of discount∣ing is great that of depositing is necessa∣rily small No man deposits and applies for discount at the same time for it would be like paying interest for lending money instead of for borrowing it The deposits that are now made at the bank are almost entirely in bank notes and consequently they add nothing to the abi∣lity off the bank to pay of the bank notes that may be presented for payment and besides this the deposits are no more the property of the bank than the cash or bank notes in a merchant's counting house  are the property of his bookkeeper No great increase therefore of bank notes be∣yond what the discounting business admits can be accounted for on the score of de∣posits  Thirdly The bank acts as banker for the government This is the connection that threatens ruin to every public bank It is through this connection that the cre∣dit of a bank is forced far beyond what it ought to be and still further beyond its ability to pay It is through this connec∣tion that such an immense redundant quantity of bank notes have gotten into circulation and which instead of being issued because there was property in the bank have been issued because there was none  When the treasury is empty which happens in almost every year of every war its coffers at the bank are empty also It is in this condition of emptiness that the minister has recourse to emissions of wh  t are called exchequer and navy bills which continually generates a new increase of bank notes and which are sported upon the public without there  being property in the bank to pay them These exchequer and navy bills being as I have said emitted because the trea∣sury and its coffers at the bank are empty and cannot pay the demands that come in are no other than an acknowledgement that the bearer is entitled to receive so much money They may be compared to the settlement of an account in which the debtor acknowledges the balance he owes and for which he gives a note of hand or to a note of hand given to raise money upon it  Sometimes the bank discounts those bills as it would discount merchants bills of exchange sometimes it purchases them of the holders at the current price and sometimes it agrees with the minister to pay an interest upon them to the holders and keep them in circulation In every one of those cases an additional quantity of bank notes get into circulation and are sported as I have said upon the public without there being property in the bank as banker for the government to pay them and besides this the bank has now no money of its own for the money  that was originally subscribed to begin the the credit of the bank which at its first es∣tablishment has been lent to government and wasted long ago  The bank says Smith book chap acts not only as an ordinary bank but as a great engine of state it receives and pays the greater part of the annuities which are due to the cre∣ditors of the public  It is worth observing that the public or the nation is always put for the government in speak∣ing of debts It circulates says Smith  exchequer bills and it advances to go∣vernment the annual amount of the land and malt taxes which are frequent∣ly not paid till several years afterwards  This advancement is also done in bank∣notes for which there is not property in the bank  In those different operati∣ons says Smith  its duty to the public  may sometimes have obliged it without any fault of its directors  to over stock the circulation with paper money  bank notes How its  duty to the public  can induce it to  over stock that public  with pro∣missory bank notes which it  cannot pay  and thereby expose the individuals of that public to ruin is too paradoxical to be explained for it is on the credit which individuals  give to the bank  by receiving and circulating its notes and not upon its  own  credit or its  own  property for it has none that the bank sports If how∣ever it be the duty of the bank to expose the public to this hazard it is at least equally the duty of the individuals of that public to get their money and take care of themselves and leave it to place∣men pensioners government contractors Reeves's association and the members of both houses of Parliment who have vot∣ed away the money at the nod of the minister to continue the credit if they can and for which their estates individual∣ly and collectively ought to answer as far as they will go  There has always existed and still ex∣ists a mysterious suspicious connection between the minister and the directors of the bank and which explains itself no otherways than by a continual increase of bank notes Without therefore enter∣ing into any further details of the various  contrivances by which bank notes are is∣sued and thrown upon the public I pro∣ceed as I before mentioned to offer an estimate on the total quantity of bank notes in circulation  However disposed governments may be to wring money by taxes from the peo∣ple there is a limit to the practice esta∣blished in the nature of things That limit is the proportion between the quan∣tity of money in a nation be that quan∣tity what it may and the greatest quan∣tity of taxes that can be raised upon it People have other uses for money besides paying taxes and it is only a proportion∣al part of that money they can spare for taxes as it is only a proportional part they can spare for houserent for clothing or for any other particular use These proportions find out and establish them∣selves and that with such exactness that if any one part exceeds its propor∣tion all the other parts  eel it  Before the invention of paper money bank notes there was no other money in the nation than gold and silver and the greatest quantity of money that ever  was raised in taxes during that period never exceeded a fourth part of the quan∣tity of money in the nation It was high taxing when it came to this point The taxes in the time of William the Third never reached to four millions before the invention of paper and the quantity of money in the nation at that time was estimated to be about sixteen millions The same proportions established them∣selves in France There was no paper money in France before the present revo∣lution and the taxes were collected in gold and silver money The highest quan∣tity of taxes never exceeded twentytwo millions sterling and the quantity of gold and silver money in the nation at the same time as stated by Mr Neckar from returns of coinage at the mints in his Treatise on the Administration of the Fi∣nances was about ninety millions sterling To go beyond this limit of a fourth part in England they were obliged to intro∣duce paper money and the attempt to go beyond it in France where paper could not be introduced broke up the  government This proportion therefore of a fourth part is the limit which the nature of the thing establishes for itself be the quantity of money in a nation more or less  The amount of taxes in England at this time is full twenty millions and there∣fore the quantity of gold and silver and of bank notes taken together amounts to eighty millions The quantity of gold and silver as stated by Lord Hawkesbu∣ry's secretary George Chalmers as I have before shewn is twenty millions and therefore the total amount of bank notes in circulation all made payable on demand is sixty millions This enormous sum will astonish the most stupid stockjobber and overpower the credulity of the most thoughtless Englishman but were it only a third of that sum the bank cannot pay half a crown in a pound  There is something curious in the move∣ments of this modern complicated ma∣chine the funding system and it is only now that it is beginning to unfold the full extent of its movements In the first part of its movements it gives great powers  into the hands of government and in the last part it takes them completely away  The funding system set out with raising revenues under the name of loans by means of which government became both prodigal and powerful The loaners as∣sumed the name of creditors and though it was soon discovered that loaning was governmentjobbing those pretended loaners or the persons who purchased into the funds afterwards conceived themselves not only to be creditors but to be the  only  creditors  But such has been the operation of this complicated machine the funding system that it has produced unperceived a se∣cond generation of creditors more nu∣merous and far more formidable and withal more real than the first generation for every holder of a bank note is a cre∣ditor and a real creditor and the debt due to him is made payable on demand The debt therefore which the government owes to individuals is composed of two parts the one about four hundred milli∣ons bearing interest the other about sixty millions payable on demand The one is  called the funded debt the other is the debt due in bank notes  This second debt that contained in the bank notes has in a great measure been incurred to pay the interest of the first debt so that in fact little or no real in∣terest has been paid by government The whole has been delusion and fraud Go∣vernment first contracted a debt in the form of loans with one class of people and then run clandestinely into debt with another class by means of bank notes to pay the interest Government acted of itself in contracting the first debt and made a machine of the bank to contract the second  It is this second debt that changes the seat of power and the order of things for it puts it in the power of even a small part of the holders of bank notes had they no other motive than disgust at Pitt and Greenville's sedition bills to controul any measure of government they found to be injurious to their interest and that not by popular meetings or popular so∣cieties but by the simple and easy opera∣  on of withholding their credit from  that government that is by individually demanding payment at the bank for every bank note that comes into their hands Why should Pitt and Greenville expect that the very men whom they insult and injure should at the same time continue to support the measure of Pitt and Green∣ville by giving credit to their promissory notes of payment No new emissions of bank notes could go on while payment was demanding on the old and the cash in the bank wasting daily away nor any new advances be made to government or to the emperor to carry on the war nor any new emission be made of exche∣quer bills  "The bank"  says Smith book ii ch "is  a great engine of state  " And in the same paragraph he says  "The stabili∣ty of the bank is equal to that of the Bri∣tish government"  which is the same as to say that the stability of the government is equal to that of the bank and no more If then the bank cannot pay the  arch∣treasurer of the holy Roman empire  S R I A  Part of the inscription on an English guinea  is a bankrupt When folly in∣vented  vented titles she did not attend to their application for ever since the go∣vernment of England has been in the hands of  archtreasurers  it has been run∣ning into bankrupty and as to the archtreasurer  apparent  he has been a bankrupt long ago What a miserable prospect has England before its eyes  Before the war of there were no bank notes lower than twenty pounds During that war bank notes of fifteen pounds and of ten pounds were coined and now since the commencement of the present war they are coined as low as five pounds These five pound notes will circulate chiefly among little shopkeepers butchers bakers market people renters of small houses lodgers c All the high departments of commerce and the affluent stations of life were already  overstocked  as Smith expresses it with the bank notes No place remained open wherein to croud an additional quantity of bank notes but among the class of peo∣ple I have just mentioned and the means of doing this could be best affected by coming five pound notes This conduct  has the appearance of that of an unprin∣cipled insolvent who when on the verge of bankruptcy to the amount of many thou∣sands will borrow as low as five pounds of the servants in his house and break the next day  But whatever momentary relief or aid the minister and his bank might expect from this low contrivance of five pound notes it will increase the inability of the bank to pay the higher notes and hasten the destruction of all for even the small taxes that used to be paid in money will now be paid in those notes and the bank will soon find itself with scarcely any other money than what the hair powder guinea tax brings in  The bank notes make the most serious part of the business of finance what is called the national funded debt is but a trifle when put in comparison with it yet the case of the bank notes has never been touched upon But it certainly ought to be known upon what authority whether that of the minister or of the directors and upon what foundation such immense quantities are issued I have stated the  amount of them at sixty millions sterling I have produced data for that estimation and besides this the apparent quantity of them far beyond that of gold and silver in the nation corroborates therewith But were there but a third part of sixty millions the bank cannot pay half a crown in the pound for no new supply of money as before said can arrive at the bank as all the taxes will be paid in paper  When the funding system began it was not doubted that the loans that had been borrowed would be repaid Co∣vernment not only propagated that be∣lief but it began paying them off In time this profession came to be abandon∣ed and it is not difficult to see that bank notes will march the same way for the amount of them is only another debt un∣der another name and the probability is that Mr Pitt will at last propose funding them In that case bank notes will not be so valuable as French assignats The assignats have a solid property in reserve in the national domains bank notes have none and besides this the English re∣venue must then sink down to what the  amount of it was before the funding sys∣tem began between three and four mil∣lions One of which the  archtreasurer  would require for himself and the arch∣treasurer  apparent  would require three quarters of a million more to pay his debts  "In France"  says Sterne  they order these things better  I have now exposed the English system of finance to the eyes of all nations In doing this I have done an act of justice to those numerous citizens of neutral na∣tions who have been imposed upon by that fraudulent system and who have pro∣perty at stake upon the event  As an individual citizen of America and as far as an individual can go I have revenged if I may use the expression without any immoral meaning the pirat∣ical depredations commited on the Ame∣rican commerce by the English govern∣ment I have retaliated for France on the subject of finance and I conclude with retorting on Mr Pitt the expression he used against France and say that the English system of finance  is on the  verge nay even in the gulph of bank∣ruptcy  THOMAS PAINE  Paris Germinal  th th  year  April    FINIS  NEW PUBLICATIONS FOR SALE
