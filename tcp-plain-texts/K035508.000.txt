 THE EAST INDIAN A COMEDY  IN FIVE ACTS  As Performed at the THEATREROYAL DRURYLANE  By M G LEWIS Esq M P  Author of the MONK CASTLE SPECTRE c  SECOND EDITION  Quadringenta tibi si quis Deus aut similis Diis  Et melior fatis donaret homuncio quantus  Ex nihilo fieres quantus Virronis amicus  "Da Trebio""Pone ad Trebium""Vis  rator ab ipsis  "Ilibus▪"O nummi vobis hunc praestat honorem  Vos estis Fratres  JUVENAL Sat  LONDON PRINTED BY J DAVIS CHANCERY LANE FOR J BELL NO OXFORD STREET M DCCC  PREFACE  THE Plot of this Comedy as far as regards Rivers's visits to Modish and Mrs Ormond was taken from the Novel of Sidney Biddulph Mr Sheridan had already borrowed the same incident from the same source and employed it though in a different manner in the "School for Scandal"  The "East Indian" was admirably well acted from beginning to end particularly the part of Rivers by Mr Kemble nothing was overcharged nothing underacted Indeed to call his performance  acting  is doing it injustice It was nature throughout  This Comedy was written before I was sixteen It was performed last season for the benefits of Mrs Jordan and Mrs Powell and in consequence of the approbation with which it was received was brought forward again in last December It was again received with applause for which I thank the Public the succeeding representations did not prove attractive for which I here make my acknowledgments to Mr Sheridan who blocked up  my road mounted on his great tragic warhorse Pizarro and trampled my humble padnag of a Comedy under foot without the least compunction My Readers must decide whether my Play merited so transient an existence it is unnecessary to say that  I  am quite of the contrary opinion  Jan  M G LEWIS  PROLOGUE  By the Author  SPOKEN BY MR C KEMBLE  IN life's gay spring while yet the careless hours  Dance light on blooming beds of early flowers  Ere knowledge of the world has taught the mind  To sorrow for itself and shun mankind  In sweet vain dreams still Fancy bids the boy  Doat on fair prospects of ideal joy  Life's choicest fruits then court his eager hand  Each eye is gentle and each voice is bland  False friendship prompts no sigh and draws no tear  And love seems scarce more beauteous than sincere  Ere sixteen years had wing'd their wanton flight  While yet his head was young and heart was light  Our author plann'd these scenes and while he drew  How bright each colour seem'd each line how true  Gods with what rapture every speech he spoke  Gods how he chuckled as he penn'd each joke  And when at length his ravish'd eyes survey  That wondrous work completea Five Act Play  His youthful heart how self applauses swell  "It isn't perfect but its vastly well"  Since then with many a pang our Bard has bought  More just decision and less partial thought  Kind vanity no longer blinds his sight  His fillet falls and lets in odious light  Time bids the darling work its leaves expand  Each flower Parnassian withers in his hand  Stern judgement every latent fault detects  And all its fancied beauties prove defects  Yet for she thinks some scenes possess an art  To please the fancy and to melt the heart  Thalia bids his play tonight appear  Thalia call'd in heaven but Jordan here  The Comedy was first performed for the Benefit of Mrs Jordan    So frail his hope so weak he thinks his cause  Our author says he dares not ask applause  He only begs that with indulgence new  You'll hear him patiently and hear him through  Then if his piece proves worthless never sham it  But damn it gentle friendsOh damn it damn it  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  LORD LISTLESS  Mr PALMER  MODISH  Mr BARRYMORE  RIVERS  Mr KEMBLE  BEAUCHAMP  Mr C KEMBLE  WALSINGHAM  Mr AICKIN  FRANK  Mr BANNISTER jun  This part was latterly played by

Show him up    Exit  Robert  I'm glad that he's returned to England for though a young man and a gay man Beauchamp is among the few whom I esteem  Enter  BEAUCHAMP  My dear Ned  BEAU  Mr WalsinghamThis pleasure is quite unexpected but where have you been concealed these hundred years I was afraid that Cynthia wearied of her Endymion had pitched upon  you  for his successor and believed you at this moment an inhabitant of the moon  WAL  No no my young friend the goddess has too much taste to select such an old weatherbeaten fellow for a Cecisbeo But if you seriously ask what I've been doing for these last three years you must know I've been foolhunting  BEAU  Foolhunting  WAL  Yes Being of an adust cynical constitution infinite laughter is absolutely necessary for my health for this purpose my physician prescribed me a course of fools and truly I've reaped great benefit from his advice  BEAU  Why then leave Great Britain Heaven knows a scarcity of fools is not one of our wants  WAL  True but the growth of English absurdity for the year not being to my taste I determined to change my fools as other invalids change the air but after all I must give the preference to the folly of my own country  BEAU  Your own country is very much obliged to you but since this is your taste I've a superb feast for you in Lord Listless  WAL  What your uncle  BEAU  No to my sorrow he sleeps with his forefathers while my noble cousin possesses his title and estate and what is worst has me entirely in his power  WAL  How so  BEAU  'Tis a tedious story but the short of it is that when I married my generous uncle discharged my debts to the tune of OOOl unluckily he neglected to destroy my acknowledgment which falling into his son's hands the present Earl wisely keeps it and calls himself my sole creditor Discharge it for some time I cannot  but however unless we disagree he will not press me for immediate payment  WAL  Well well and even if he should we'll find means to satisfy him and so away with that gloomy face dear Ned As soon as I saw you I guessed that something was wrong but I'm glad 'twas nothing more than a pecuniary difficulty  BEAU  Would to heaven it were  WAL  Hey Why what other cause  BEAU  Oh Mr Walsingham how shall I tell you  WAL  Out with it  BEAU  That I have beenThat I still ama villain  WAL  I don't believe one word of it he who dares own that he has been a villain must needs already have ceased to be one  BEAU  Hear me then and judge for yourselfYou knew well the character of the woman to whose fate while I was still a stripling accident not affection united mine  WAL  Yes and a miserable life she led you  BEAU  Jealous without love profuse without generosity negligent in her dress violent in her temper coarse in her manners with no virtue but that one which she owed to constitution not to principle during three years she rendered my home an hell My patience was at length exhausted I made over to her the remnants of an estate which her extravagance had ruined bade this domestic fiend an eternal farewell and sailed under the assumed name of Dorimant to India  WAL  I see no harm as yet Lived with her three years I wouldn't have lived with her three daysNo not to have buried her on the fourth  BEAU  Soon after my arrival it was my chance to save the life of the famous Mortimer who  WAL  The Nabob whose immense wealth  BEAU  The same This procured me admission to his house where I saw his daughter She was lovely and grateful to me for the preservation of her father's life opportunities of seeing each other were frequent and in an unguarded momentyet heaven can witness to my intentionsin an unguarded moment II was a villain  WAL  shaking his head  Little better I must say  BEAU  Her  weakness and  my  per  dy were soon discovered Marry her I could not her father's wrath was dreadful she sought a refuge from it in  my  arms and fled with me from India  WAL  From India and from her father Young man Young man And what says your wife to all this  BEAU  Soon after our separation I find that she went abroad nor has she been heard of for near two years either by her banker or her friends Report says that she is dead If so my hand is Zorayda's and in the mean while she resides with my cousin Lady Clara Modish  WAL  Lady Clara And how the devil came  she  to receive her  BEAU  The Devil made her the great Devil of all Money man darling money Her Ladyship had been extravagant and so I paid a gaming debt or two for her besides this the appearance of protecting a friendless orphan flatters that oftentatious sensibility which it is her passion to display on every occasion  WAL  But does she know the history of her protegée  BEAU  I was compelled to trust her with it under a promise of profound secrecy  WAL  And how has she kept her promise  BEAU  Why really extremely well considering she's a woman of fashion She only confided it to her most intimate friends who told it again to all their particular acquaintance who repeated it to every creature they knew and now the whole Town is informed of the whole transaction  WAL  And you really have the heart to present this poor young creature to the world in a light so despicable  BEAU  Spare your reproaches my dear sir they have already been made by a very able advocate You remember Modish's sister Emily  WAL  Young Ormond's widowA charming creature  BEAU  She is interested about Zorayda and has frequently written to me on this subject Her remonstrances have carried with them conviction and I am resolved to wait on her this morning to entreat her protection for Zorayda and should she grant it to engage cruel as it will be to the feelings of us both no more to visit my love till I can offer her my hand and fortune  WAL  A very good resolution too I long to see your goddess  BEAU  Come then to Lady Clara's and behold the fictitious charms of modish beauty effaced by the native graces the enchanting simplicity of my artless my bewitching Zorayda But as this is but weak attraction for a satirist if you still exclaim "Thou Folly art my goddess" I can promise  you some diversion in your own way for Lady Clara's table is seldom unsupplied with a plentiful banquet of fools  WAL  Every table in town may be supplied with that article at a very small expence I doubt not for after all my peregrinations in quest of folly I am decided that no country abounds more with that luxury than little England where absurdities spring as kindly as mushrooms upon dunghills and you can't turn a corner without starting a fool  Exeunt  SCENE IILady CLARA's  Enter  Mrs TIFFANY  and  SLIPSLOP  Mrs TIF  No really Mrs Slipslop I can't stay a moment longer and I'm sure her La'ship will find the dress quite the thing  SLIP  Can't

will I trust thee gentle Slipslop  Mrs SLIP  So far indeed  ZOR  Not a jot farther  Enter  John  JOHN  Lord Listless  Exit  Mrs SLIP  Aside  Miss keeps her secret as close as if 'twere a scheme she had prevented for paying off the natural debt and was frightful that somebody would embellish her ideras  Exit  Enter  Lord LISTLESS  Lord LIST  Quite alone Miss Mandeville Where's Clara  ZOR  Still at breakfast in her dressingroom She slept ill and left her bed late this morning  Lord LIST  She was quite in the right for my part I wonder why people leave their beds at all for they only contrive to bore themselves and their acquaintance Now I've some thoughts of going to bed one of these nights and never getting up again  ZOR  Oh pray my Lord put that scheme into execution for the benefit of your friends as well as yourself  Lord LIST  Yes 'twould certainly take for people imitate every thing I do so ridiculously that 'pon my soul I'm bored to death with them but to say the truth I'm bored with every thing and every body  ZOR  I should be sorry to increase your ennui and so wish you good morning  Lord LIST  No no stay pray stay for there's nothing I like so much as the company of Ladies  ZOR  drawing away her hand  I'm sorry that I can't return the compliment but there's nothing I like so little as the company of Lords  Lord LIST  Umph Pert enough 'pon my soul  Enter  Lady CLARA  Lord LIST  Morning Clara You look frightful today  Lady CLARA  Do I I dare say I do for my nerves are in such a stateOh and then I had such a dreamOnly conceive Methought my favourite little Pug Fidelio had fallen into the  Serpentine I saw him struggling heard him barking and woke in an agony of tears  ZOR  Exquisite sensibility  Lady CLARA  Ha Beauchamp  Enter  BEAUCHAMP  and  WALSINGHAM  BEAU  Let me present a friend to you Lady Clara whose absence from England you've heard me frequently lamentMr Walsingham  Lady CLARA  Your friends are always welcome here for  your  sake but Mr Walsingham will be welcome for his own  WAL  Your ladyship does me honour  Aside to Beauchamp  Is she a fool too  BEAU  None of the wisest I promise youMiss Mandeville Mr Walsingham  Zorayda

wretch my husband  ZOR  aside to Beauchamp  You couldn't have introduced a greater stranger  Enter  MODISH  MOD  Mr Walsingham I rejoice to see you Just returned I supposeYou rested well I hope Lady Clara  carelessly  Lady CLARA  Perfectly never passed a quieter night in my life  JOHN  delivers a Letter to  Modish  and goes off    MOD  opens and then throws it on the table  Rivers  WAL  I beg I mayn't prevent  MOD  Oh it's from a poor relation 'twill keepBeauchamp were you at Lady Sparkle's last night  BEAU  Yes and sound it very fashionable and very dull  Lady CLARA  Oh the terms are now synonimous  MOD  Quite for since every thing that's fashionable is insipid in mere justice every thing that's insipid must be fashionable  WAL  Indeed Is this really so my lord  Lord LIST  Matter of fact sir 'pon my soul In  ip  ty is now the very criterion of fashion A man of  ton  should never dance but when he's not wanted or sing but when nobody wishes to hear him He should yawn at a comedy laugh at a tragedy cry "damn'd bore" at both tread upon his neighbour's toes hunt with a toothpick in his mouth see women tumble down stairs without trying to stop them and in order to be perfectly fashionable should make himself completely disagreeable  ZOR  Bless me how admirably your Lordship's practice exemplifies your theory  Lord LIST  Oh you flatter me  ZOR  No really I do you but justice when I protest that I never saw any thing half so fashionable or insipid as your Lordship  WAL  Nor I upon my honour  Lord LIST  'Pon my soul you're too obliging Too obliging 'pon my soul  Lady CLARA  Hark A knock  ZOR  looking from the window  Now heaven preserve my hearing 'tis Miss Chatterall  Lady CLARA  I'm glad of it she always talks scandal and scandal is the best thing in the world for the nerves  Lord LIST  And she talks incessantly which saves one the trouble of an answer  ZOR  But she is so malicious  Lady CLARA  She cheats horribly at play  MOD  She's disagreeable and affected  Lord LIST  She's a bore  BEAU  She's deceitful  Lady CLARA  She's abominable  Enter  Miss CHATTERALL  Lady CLARA  My dear creature I'm so charmed to see you We've not met this age  Miss CHAT  Oh Lady Clara such a dreadful thing has happened to me I've been so shocked and so quizzed and all that  Lady CLARA  You alarm me  Miss CHAT  You must know as I came along another carriage got entangled with mine A mob soon collected round us and out of pure good  nature and condescension I thought I'd entertain them with a little graceful terror  Lady CLARA  How kind  Miss CHAT  Wasn't itSo on this I screamed in the most delightful way imaginable practised my new Parisot attitudes and threw myself into my very best convulsions  MOD  And I warrant the spectators burst into tears  Miss CHAT  No truly they burst out a laughing  ALL  Oh shameful  Miss CHAT  Wasn't itI declare I was just like Orphy the old fiddler playing to the stocks and stones The more I squalled the more they laughed and at last they made me so angry that I vowed never to go into fits again except in the very best company  WAL  And a mighty proper resolution too  Miss CHAT  Wasn't itBut Modish what provoked me most was your uncle that great gawky creature General Truncheon He never offered to help me the least bit And then he hahahae'd and hehehe'd and all that so you've no ideaHow shocking Wasn't it  MOD  Oh you know my uncle's a blockhead he's supposed to have the greatest body and least wit of any man in London  ZOR  That follows of course I've observed that in lofty houses the upper apartments are always the worst furnished  Miss CHAT  Very well Miss Mandeville extremely well indeed  Aside  I'll remember that and sport it for my ownBut Lord I must be gone or Lady Cogwell will be out and I wouldn't miss seeing her for the world  Lady CLARA  Lady Cogwell I thought she was your aversion  Miss CHAT  Oh dear so she is but last night Mrs Punt playing with her at whist found the ace of diamonds hid in her muff so I'm going to comfort and console and vex and teaze her and all that you know Modish lead me to my carriage You won't go with me Miss Mandeville  ZOR  No I'm not in a vexing teazing and all that humour this morning But are you sure of the truth of this story  Miss CHAT  Sure of it Why Mrs Blaball told it me and I believe all she says to be gospel for she has talked scandal to me every morning for this year and an half past and in all that time never told the least bit of a lye How kind of her Wasn't it  Lady CLARA  Are you going Mr Walsingham We dine at home if you can put up with a family dinner    He bows and exit with  Beauchamp  You'll be with me in the evening Miss Chatterall  Miss CHAT  Oh without fail and I hope by that time to have collected authentic information concerning two elopements four young men ruined at play nine ladies of quality taken tripping with their footmen and one who died of a cold which she caught in going to church How comical Wasn't it Come Modish  Exit with  Modish  Lord LIST  Pray ClaraWhat was I going toOh Where does Mrs Ormond live  Lady CLARA  I protest I've forgotten but the porter can tell you May I ask why you enquire  Lord LIST  I've no sort of objection to your asking the question provided you've none to my not answering it Good morning we shall meet at dinner or perhaps not till tomorrow or perhaps not this month it doesn't signify you know if we never meet at all  Lady CLARA  Oh not in the leastGood morning  Exit  Lord Listless  ZOR  I see Mr Modish returning shall I stay or leave you to your usual discussions Perhaps my presence may prevent  Lady CLARA  Oh child don't mind me these little matrimonial rubs are excellent for the vapours and Modish is never so entertaining as when I've put him out of temper  ZOR  I'm sure then he's entertaining very often but I cannot admire your mode of making him so▪ and for my own part I verily think that were I to live a thousand years I could never succeed in extracting amusement from my husband's uneasiness or find pleasure in being the torment of a man whom I had sworn before the altar to love and to obey  Exit  Enter  MODISH  Lady CLARA    humming an Italian air opens  Modish's  letter thoughtless  y    Lud what am I doing Beg your pardon Modish I've not read ten words upon my honour  MOD  'Twas of no consequence  Lady CLARA  Oh it might have been from a lady and I've no wish

to find that a man still exists whom I doubt not he has long numbered with the dead Still more will it surprise you to know that soon after my arrival in India my union with a rich widow at once cleared me of debt and placed me in a state of opulence"  Lady CLARA  Opulence This grows interesting  MOD  "On my wife's death I realized my fortune determined to share it with you my dear George"

Moderate your tone I beg consider my nerves  MOD  My manner madam may be moderate but the matter must be harsh  Lady CLARA  Oh sir let but your voice be gentle and as to the matter of what you say I shan't mind it a straw  MOD  What I say madam you never do mind  Lady CLARA  True sir I never do  MOD  Madam madam I must say and I will say  Lady CLARA  Say sir Lord couldn't you sing 'Twould be much more agreeable  MOD  Zounds madam I'm serious and well I may be so My affairs are so embarrassed that I expect an execution in the house every day and but one way remains of preventing it You must give up your diamonds I'll procure you paste instead and as you're known to possess real jewels nobody will suspect those you wear to be false  Lady CLARA  Well sir I'll only mention one circumstance and then if you still wish it the diamonds are at your disposal  MOD  aside  So readily I'm amazedWell my dear Lady Clara and this circumstance is  Lady CLARA  Simply this About three months ago I

 So he's gone at last  Mrs SLIP  And truly I'm glad of it No wonder your La'ship was so flusterated at seeing him for when I first saw his odorous black scratch I protest it threw me into such a constellation that I thought I should have conspired upon the spot  Lady CLARA  Poor Slipslop Order the carriage to the door  Exit  Slipslop  MOD  Before you go madam I must say  Lady CLARA  My dear Mr Modish say not another word on the subject since on one point I am decided that whenever we are of different opinions you must be wrong and I must be right Good morning  Exit  MOD  I've gained much by this conference Bachelors Bachelors Tye yourselves up in the noose of hemp rather than the noose of matrimony The pain of the former is never felt after a few minutes but the knot of the latter

Turn you away No but I'm constrained to dismiss you  FRANK  Dismiss meVery wellDo itBut I won't go  Mrs ORM  Nay but Frank  FRANK  And you can be cruel enough to turn me away In Mr Ormond's family have I lived forty years man and boy and now all of a sudden you turn me adrift Ah I see a fair face may hide an hard heart  Mrs ORM  But hear me my good fellow my circumstances demand retrenchment and unable longer either to maintain or pay you  FRANK  I don't want to be paid I don't want to be maintained I ask but to see you every morning and be assured you are in health I ask but to see my young master grow up the image of his father carry him in my arms while he's a child and when he's a man to die in his presence I ask but this and you refuse me Yet you cannot surely be so cruel you could never really mean to drive me away  Kneeling  Dear good lady comfort me say you did this but to try me say you never really meant to part with your poor and faithful Frank  Mrs ORM  affected

my cousin Emily's remembrance  Mrs ORM  Is it possible Surely sir I now speak to Mr Rivers  RIV  Even so but if you recollect my story as well as my features I fear you are not prejudiced in my favour my juvenile follies  Mrs ORM    eagerly  Sir my father loved you his friends can never be judged harshly by me But pray inform me I fear your expedition to the East  RIV  The East my dear lady was sufficiently kind but on my return a tempest swept in one moment away the gains of eighteen painful years  Mrs ORM  I feel for your disappointmentbut ere we proceed may I not offer you some breakfast I am rather an invalid and  rose  late today  RIV  Were it not an intrusion  Mrs ORM  Intrusion Oh my good sir to meet with one whom my father loved and who loved my father is to me a delight so exquisite and which now alas I enjoy so rarelyNay be seated I must not be denied  RIV  What a contrast  aside  I fear you will think me impertinent yet I must hazard one enquiry How comes it that your situation differs from your brother's so strangely  Mrs ORM  Oh at my first entrance into life my establishment was not less splendid but my husband's nature generous and benevolent to excess ultimately proved our ruin He was compelled to part with his estate and we retired to an humble retreat where my beloved Ormond expired  RIV  But still your jointure  Mrs ORM  Satisfied my husband's creditors nor till I felt it could I believe that so much pleasure could be purchased by a sacrifice so trifling  RIV  aside  An angel by Jupiter  Mrs ORM  This avowal must excuse my not offering you that assistance which I should afford you most willingly but doubtless on applying to my brother  RIV  I have applied  Mrs ORM  And the result was  RIV  Coldness and scorn  Mrs ORM  IndeedOh

such an heart I am rich Emily richYet I lye for all that was mine is now yours  Mrs ORM  Amazement Can this be real  RIV  A few hours shall convince you of its truth nor can you feel better pleased to be heiress of my riches than I feel at finding an heiress who deserves them But I must away and begin my preparations for by six o'clock you must be lodged in your own house attended by your own servants and ready to welcome me at your own table  Mrs ORM  But dear sir this great haste  RIV  Oh hang delay what I do I do at once and so farewell for the present  Going  Mrs ORM  But at least take back these notes their value  RIV  Is trifling when compared with that of your present  kissing it  But neverno while I have life never will I part with this note I'll wear it next my heart as a talisman for you gave it when you could full ill afford it and gave it too from the noblest of motives compassion for the distrest and respect for the memory of a father  Exit  Mrs ORM  This event so unexpected so sudden  Now than I can look forward once more without anxietyOh from what a weight is my bosom relievedWilliammy dear my darling Williamthy prospects are bright againWhile she clasps

blame me for not accepting your proposals but could I so easily forget Mr Ormond's loss I must frankly own that your Lordship is by no means the man whom I think likely to make me happy in a second marriage  Lord LIST  Marriage my dear creature who said a word on the subject Nothing could be farther from my thoughts for  I  think marriage a great bore Don't youNow what I meant was that sort of amicable arrangement which when we grow tired of each other as I doubt not we soon shall may leave both at liberty to pursue our separate inclinations Thus stands the case You are poor I am rich you are handsome so am I Despise then the opinions of prudes and cynics and sharing a splendid establishment with love and me  yawning  Mrs ORM  Beyond a doubt must be perfectly enchanting  Aside  Insolent coxcomb Yet he's so absurd that anger here would be ridiculous  Lord LIST  Yes I thought you'd like the proposal Nay I should have flown to you with it upon the wings of love a month ago if something or other hadn't continually driven it out of my head and if my valet hadn't put me in mind of it this morning 'pon my soul I believe I shouldn't have remembered it at all  Mrs ORM  It were

one has much to fear from your Lordship  Lord LIST  I don't understand that sneer but the immediate enforcement of your bond shall convince you that you sir at least have something to fear from me This will be merely a proper mode of punishing your present conduct which I cannot but consider as ungrateful in the extreme and 'pon my soul I should be in a confounded passion if being angry were not too great an exertion for a man of fashion  Exit  BEAU  Mean coxcomb Mrs Ormond I fear your agitation  Mrs ORM  Oh a fit of tears has relieved me but how can I sufficiently thank you for your interference  BEAU  By accepting without scruple this from Zorayda  Giving a packet  Mrs ORM  And its contents are  BEAU  Hearing that Mr Rivers meant to apply to you for assistance and fearing lest your ability to relieve him should not square with your inclination she readily sacrificed some jewels which she had long been anxious to possess and appropriated the money to the alleviation of his distresses  Mrs ORM  Noble girl And while such is  her  conduct how Colonel Beauchamp how can you justify your own either to her or to yourself  BEAU  Justify it I cannot Yet surely circumstances may in some measure extenuate its impropriety The woman's character who for my sins calls me her husband  Mrs ORM  That woman be she what she may is still your wife Colonel Beauchamp nor are her faults any apology for yours I may pity you for being united to such a woman but while she exists I must blame your attachment to any other  BEAU  Well then my fair moralist shew that pity by counselling my future conduct What should I do  Mrs ORM  Can you ask me Restore Zorayda to virtue and her father  BEAU  On one condition you shall be obeyed A report which seems well authenticated has reached me

and if false  Mrs ORM  You will then be guided by me  BEAU  There is my hand on my honour I will  Mrs ORM  I accept then your conditionsWhen mean you to set out for Turin  BEAU  I am impatient to be gone yet how to tell Zorayda that I must leave her  Mrs ORM  Be that my care  BEAU  Dear Mrs Ormond would you but undertake that painful task would you explain to her the object of my journey to Turin and should it prove unsuccessful strive to reconcile her to the cruel alternative  Mrs ORM  All this shall be done though not exactly by me situated as I am with Lady Clara I cannot go myself to her house uninvited but I think Mr Rivers may without impropriety under the pretext of returning to her this now unnecessary present  BEAU  Unnecessary Have his wants then been already relieved  Mrs ORM  They needed no relief Rivers is wealthy and the object of his visit to Lady Clara's this morning was to make an experiment on her heart not her purse Zorayda's gift therefore being now superfluous I will persuade Rivers to return it to her himself and while expressing his gratitude for her wellintended benevolence he may take an opportunity of convincing her that your absence is necessary that Lady Clara's is by no means a proper abode for her and he shall press her 'till the result of your inquiries shall have determined her future conduct to accept an asylum in my house  BEAU  And will

plunge her deepermany a poor victim of imprudence now struggling with the billows might easily regain the shoreBut when some unhappy girl has made the first false step branded with shame abandoned by her former friends courted by vice and shunned by virtue no wonder that she flies from remorse to the arms of luxury and purchases a momentary oblivion of her sorrows by a repetition of the fault which caused them  Exeunt severally  END  of the  SECOND ACT  ACT III  SCENE I  An Apartment elegantly furnished  Mrs ORMOND  and  RIVERS  are seated near a Table on which is Desert c  RIVERS  WELL well your commission is a delicate one and I doubt much my executing it to your satisfaction but however I'll do my best Beauchamp you say is the villain's name who  Mrs ORM  It is but guilty as he is in the present instance justice compels me to say that by no other act has he ever merited the name of villain  RIV  By my soul this one is quite sufficient The married seducer of an unsuspecting girl the selfish betrayer of a father's confidence Oh he's qualified to take the degree of villain in any college of vice throughout the universe  Mrs ORM  Thus severe upon Beauchamp how can Miss Mandeville's errors hope from you that indulgence  RIV  Surely the case is widely different besides her generosity has interested me sincerely in her behalf This you say is the packet which I am to return to herMandevilleMandevilleI don't recollect any person of that name in India but no matter Whoever her father may be if he really loves his daughter heartily shall I rejoice to relieve the poor man from suffering what I once felt so keenly myself  Mrs ORM  Yourself  RIV  Emily it was my misfortune to have a daughter on whom my soul doated Her mother died while my child was yet an infant and my child was the image of that mother was the delight of my eye was the comfort of my heart was the solitary blessing of my existence and while that one blessing was mine I thought I possessed every other This daughter this very idolized daughter sacrificed to passion  her  honour and  my  love abandoned me for a villain and her father became childless  Mrs ORM  Is she then dead  RIV  To me for ever She fled from India doubtless with the perfidious Dorimant and what has since become of her I know not But be she where she may the ungrateful is no more my daughter  Mrs ORM  Yet were she now stretched in penitence at your feet  RIV  Stretched in her coffin I might forgive her else never  Mrs ORM  Oh Mr Rivers  RIV  Nay speak of her no more I have sworn never to pardon her that oath will I keep religiously and seek that happiness my dear cousin in  your  family which the ungrateful fugitive has banished for ever from my own  Exit  Mrs ORM  Either Mr Rivers deceives himself or the difference must be strange between a father's and a mother's feelings Yes my loved William should'st  thou  prove unworthy my regard I think my heart would break with grief but till it  did  break

peer and a man of fashion lend money Mad Positively mad dear Modish or such an idea could never have entered your head  MOD  Is it so strange then to expect assistance from a brother  Lord LIST  No but uncommonly strange to expect money from a man of fashion  MOD  Absurd when the largeness of your income  Lord LIST  Is absolutely necessary for the largeness of my expenditure 'Pon my soul my dear fellow I could almost imagine that you have quite forgotten how absolutely necessary it is for a man in my situation to keep up a certain style to have horses he never rides houses he never inhabits and mistresses he scarcely knows by sight In short these unnecessary necessities are so innumerable that I'm myself much straitened in my circumstances and mean to insist immediately upon the payment of Beauchamp's bond  MOD  How Lord Listless That bond which it is well known your father never intended toBut this is foreign to the subject Will you oblige me with the sum I mentioned  Lord LIST  I

Let Lady Clara know that I'm here and have something to say to her of importance  Exit  Slipslop  Enter  WALSINGHAM  Miss CHAT  Oh Lord Mr Walsingham  WAL  Oh Lord Miss Chatterall  Miss CHAT  I've got such a story to tell you  WAL  "A story to tell"I dare say you have  Miss CHAT  Do you know Miss Bloomly  WAL  Only by character  Miss CHAT  Then you know the worst of her for her character's monstrous shocking that's the truth on't But would you believe it she's crooked How comical an't it  WAL  Crooked Impossible  Miss CHAT  Oh but I assure you it's true for her most intimate friend told me so just now with her own mouth  WAL  Her friendA pretty sort of a friend by my honour Before I'd have such friends  Miss CHAT  Nay but Mr Walsingham there was no harm in telling it to  me  for she knew very well it would go no further  WAL  Did she Then I pronounce her a most learned lady for she knows what no other person in London does man woman or child  Miss CHAT  Well but now don't repeat this story I beg for nobody else knows it and I only mean to tell it to Lady Clara and a few particular friends under a profound promise of secrecy  WAL  There you are quite right for whenever you wish a malicious report to circulate you should always relate it as an inviolable secretPeople of fashion hear so much scandal daily that one's own particular lye is frequently huddled in the crowd and perhaps totally forgotten but tell a fine lady a scandalous anecdote under a promise of secrecy  and I'll be bound that she pops it out within five minutes after  Exit  Miss CHAT  I declare now he doesn't believe a word of it and that's monstrous provoking However I hope it will still serve to break off Miss Bloomly's marriage with young Flash Well I protest I can't conceive how it is that every body contrives to get married except myself I'm sure I do all in my power grudge no expence in fans feathers cold cream pearl powder and bloom of oriental lilies and it was but last week that I paid the Lord knows what for a new pair of the very best arched eyebrowsYet all won't do and I'm sure it'sit's  curst  provoking so it is  Enter  ZORAYDA  Miss CHAT  Oh Miss Mandeville do you know  ZOR  Alas Yes Miss Chatterall I know it but too well  Miss CHAT  Do you Oh Gemini who could have told you  ZOR  The town talks of nothing else at first indeed I wouldn't believe the story but the redness of your eyes proves it to be but too wellfounded  Miss CHAT  My eyesDear what can you mean  ZOR  I'm sure I pity you sincerely but how  could  you be so imprudent How could you think of going in your own carriage to the place where your little boys are nursed  Miss CHAT  My little boys  ZOR  Nay it's too late to pretend ignorance I know the story but too well  Miss CHAT  Do you Then pray let me know it too for let me die if this isn't the first word I ever heard of it  ZOR  Nay this is carrying the jest too far since every body knows you were married in St Martin's Church to a Serjeant of the Guards of the name of Brazen on the th of last June at seven and thirty minutes past eleven odd seconds and that you have at this moment too fine little boys at nurse with Mrs Mum No Paradise Row three doors from the Red Lamps and Green Railing Why dear me every body knows it as well as I do  Miss CHAT  Oh Mercy What  I  marry a Serjeant in the Guards  I  have fine little boys  I  visit a vulgar Mrs Mum Oh horrid Oh monstrous  ZOR  Really Mrs Brazen  Miss CHAT  Don't call me Mrs Brazen I won't be called Mrs Brazen  ZOR  Nay 'tis a disagreeable situation I own and I declare I pity you extremely  Miss CHAT  Don't pity me Miss I won't bear to be pitied There's not a syllable of truth in the story and I'm surprised you could believe such a thing  ZOR  Oh but I had it from your friend Mrs Blaball and she you know"has talked scandal to you for this year and an half past and never told you the least bit of a lye in all that time"  Miss CHAT  Mrs Blaball A malicious creature But I always thought her a very bad woman I'll go this moment and tell herBut even if this story  were  true I don't understand Miss why you should talk to me about it of all people in the world  ZOR  Dear I thought talking over the subject would console you Did not you go this morning to Lady Cogwell on purpose to talk over the story of her cheating  Miss CHAT  Yes but I did  that  merely to teaze her  ZOR  Did you Then I vow and protest that's the very reason why  I  did  this  Miss CHAT  Indeed Then let me tell you Miss  ZOR  Come Miss Chatterall even make yourself easy After all this story of the footman is simply an experiment of mine intended to ascertain how you would bear being the heroine of such an anecdote as I have frequently heard you relate of others and I trust it will convince you that murdering characters is not an amusement quite so harmless as you and your acquaintance seem to think it  Miss CHAT  Very well Miss Very well But since you think proper to take such liberties with  ZOR  Nay nay either be calm or excuse my leaving you since if the storm must rage I prefer infinitely hearing it at a distance  BALLAD  Cease Rude Boreas  STILL this tempest wildly raging  List fair Lady list to me  Let my prayers your wrath assuaging  Calm your bosom's stormy sea  Anger now would sure be silly  Nothing should your peace destroy  While you think on little Billy  Serjeant Brazen's own sweet boy  Exit  Miss CHAT  A saucy chit I protest she has so slurried me that I dare say just now I look as hideous as herself And here's somebody coming tooI'll step into the next room and settle myself before the glass  Retires  Enter  JOHN  followed by  RIVERS  RIV  Say to Miss Mandeville that a gentleman has a message to her from Mrs Ormond    Exit  John  I feel not a little embarrassed at entering upon a business so delicate How the Deuce shall I open the conversationNay there's no time for reflection for here comes the lady  Miss CHAT    advancing and looking at him through her glass    Um a strangerAnd really a personable manI'll accost himIf you wish sir to see Lady Clara  RIV  No madam my business is with you My name is Rivers and I come here authorized by Colonel Beauchamp to converse with you on a very delicate subject  Aside  Well hang me if I see an atom of the youth and beauty which Mrs Ormond praised so highly  Miss CHAT  By Beauchamp did you say sir By Colonel Beauchamp  RIV  You seem surprised madam but suffer me to say that Beauchamp's attachment to you  Miss CHAT  Attachment to me I'm sure if he ever had any he kept it a profound secret  RIV  Ah madam you flatter yourself In spite of his precautions that secret is now so well known that things can no longer remain as they are and some change in your situation ought to take place as soon as possible I trust madam you are of my opinion  Miss CHAT  Why really sirto say the truthI can't deny that I  am  rather of your way of thinking But  Col Beauchamp has a wife  RIV  That wife he has great reason to believe exists no longer  Miss CHAT  looking pleased  IndeedDear sir but that quite alters the case you know  RIV  It does and should this event be ascertained his hand will immediately be offered where his heart has long been given  Aside  Well there certainly is no accounting for tastes  Miss CHAT  Lord sir Dear sir  Aside  Thank heaven then I  shall  be married after all  RIV  But should Mrs Beauchamp still be living  Miss CHAT  sighing  Then sir there's an end of the whole business  RIV  True madam and I rejoice that you feel the necessity It relieves me from the most embarrassing part of my commission and emboldens me to say without further ceremony that in case of your not marrying Beauchamp all your friends think it right that you should set off immediately for India  Miss CHAT  For IndiaLord sir what should I do there Why must I needs be packed off to India because I can't marry Colonel Beauchamp  RIV  My dear madam 'tis absolutely necessary and till you set sail Mrs Ormond requests you to accept an asylum in her house At first indeed she had some scruples at engaging in an affair so delicate but as she is confident that Col Beauchamp is the only person who has ever been particular to you  Miss CHAT  tossing her head  Indeed Sir Upon my word then she's very much mistaken A  great many people have been much more particular than Colonel Beauchamp I can assure her  RIV  How a great many  Miss CHAT  Yes sir Fifty at least  RIV  Zounds madam fifty  Miss CHAT  Bless me sir what is there so strange in that Why if I don't marry for a year I dare say there'll be fifty more  RIV  The devil there willThen madam your going to India  Miss CHAT  I'd as soon go to the moon sirWhat leave London dear London and the gay world the dear gay world The very thought on't is quite odious and execrable and all that sir an't it  RIV  But madam madam should your marriage not take place can you think it proper that Beauchamp's attachment to you should last  Miss CHAT  No to be sure I don't In that case he'll go  his  way I mine till either he has got rid of his matrimonial clog or I found some other lover as much to my liking That's all sir  RIV  Fire and furies what depravity  aside  Your grief then for his loss wouldn't prevent  Miss CHAT  Lord no sir why should it The man is certainly well enough for a man but if he breaks with me I don't despair of finding as good to supply his place  RIV  By heaven this is too muchHear me lost unhappy creature  Miss CHAT  Oh Lord bless me what's the matter  RIV  Are you then indeed so dead to shameBut I abandon you to the sorrows which cannot fail to arise from principles so depraved  Miss CHAT  How WhatSir how do you dare  RIV  Yet I thank you for not preserving the mask

him then  Mrs ORM  Oh the relief in  my  power to afford him was very moderate and in truth our exchange of presents bore no proportion to one another I had nothing to bestow on him but a very trifle and a dish of tea and he repaid me with notes of not less than a thousand pounds  Lady CLARA  Mercy on me a thousand pounds for a dish of tea How unlucky it was that I had just sent away the chocolate

pray bring Mr Rivers  Mrs ORM  I'll do my best but in truth I doubt my being able to prevail on him unless you can make use of Falstaff's excuse and protest solemnly that you knew him all the while however if he should not come depend upon it's not being a fault of mine  Lady CLARA  Well now that's a dear creature and I hope to Heaven you may suceeed Yet should your endeavours to appease Mr Rivers prove fruitless I shall console myself with the reflection that at least my dear sister enjoys those advantages of which by imprudence I have deprived myself  Aside  Oh I could tear her eyes

Thunder and Lightning  The Ghost of  QUEEN ELIZABETH  rises in a Flash of Fire  Stare not fair dames nor criticize my dress  You see before you jolly old Queen Bess  Who from the land of roasting boiling stewing  Is come to see what you above are doing  Below where some slight peccadilloes sent me  Long did a wish a foolish wish torment me  For some few days in Britain to revive  And view that land once more I lov'd so well alive  This wish so teas'd me morn night noon and eve  That I resolv'd to ask old Pluto's leave  And though I knew to gain the point was hard  Boldly dispatch'd Lord Burleigh with this card  "Queen Bess's comp'ts to Plutobegs to say  "She hopes this card will find him well today  "And should her visit now convenient be  "Means to drink sulphur with his majesty  For in our lower realms the truth to utter  Sulphur means tea and brimstone bread and butter  Well he receiv'd me and my sulphur sipp'd  "Dear Sir" quoth I"I'm nervous sick and hipp'd  "Besides have frightful dreams and truth to speak  "Scarce eat a chicken's pinion in a week  "Shock'd at my sickly plight and strange condition  "I've ask'd advice of maint and maint physician  "And having heard them with one voice declare  "Nothing can cure me but a change of air  "'Tis my design for health and for diversion  "To Albion's Isle to make a short excursion  At this old Pluto look'd extremely glum  First scratch'd his head then frown'd and bit his thumb  At length the business sifted to the dregs  Thus spoke the king with the flamecoloured legs  "Go Bess" he answer'd 'twas not o'er civil  To crop my name but 'tis an illbred Divle  "Go Bess" he answered "you've my full permission  "To visit London on this one condition  "Tonight at Drury so the papers tell  "Is play'd a  Comédie  that's  toute nouvelle  "  His majesty speaks French extremely well  "I to this piece your new existence tie  "And as it lives or dies you live or die  "Should the dread ordeal with success be pass'd  "Your second life shall for the season last  "But should it fail instant I'd have you know it  "Here you return and with youbring the poet"  I took his offer pack'd up hoods and ruffs  Strait bodice farthingales and little muffs  And least old Dis should take his promise back  Through yon trapdoor reach'd Drury in a crack  Now then I come before the Public's throne  To plead the author's cause and eke my own  Think with what terrors must my bosom tremble  Since that the piece is bad I can't dissemble  Yet weary with my journey faint with fright  Pray don't oblige me to set out tonight  Rather with kind applause prolong my stay  And for a few short nights support the play  But should my prayers prove vain should the piece fail  The plot thought dullthe humour coarse and stale  Bess out of sorts and Poet out of feather  Are damn'd alike and jog down stairs together  FINIS  Printed by J DAVIS ChanceryLane  BOOKS LATELY PUBLISHED BY J BELL No OXFORDSTREET  I AMBROSIO or THE MONK a
