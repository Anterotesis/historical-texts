 A SUPPLEMENT TO HUTTON'S ARITHMETIC CONTAINING THE SOLUTIONS AT FULL LENGTH OF THE PROMISCUOUS COLLECTION OF QUESTIONS PROPOSED IN THAT WORK  BY THE AUTHOR  LONDON PRINTED FOR G ROBINSON AND R BALDWIN IN PATERNOSTER ROW  M DCC LXXVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THE promiscuous collection of questions pro∣posed in the Arithmetic was intended for the exercise of pupils after they had gone through the several rules of the book and has been found very useful to them by accustoming them to think and to strike out methods of solution unassisted by other helps But many gentlemen having expressed a de∣sire to have a publication of the solutions of those questions at full length that they might have the satisfaction to compare their own solutions with those of the Author and thereby the opportunity of chusing which they like best he has herein complied with their request  These solutions are published apart from the work itself that the teacher may avail himself of them and yet keep them from the sight of his pupils if he so chuses each learner having only the book of arith∣metic for the purposes therein mentioned  The solutions are all delivered in what have been judged to be the best forms Sometimes two me∣thods are given where they seemed necessary In such of them as contain any proportions or ruleofthree statings the fourth term is generally put down in the form of a vulgar fraction placing the product of the second and third terms as numerator to be  divided by the first as a denominator the fraction is then abbreviated as much as it can be before the mul∣tiplication and division are performed by which means generally these two operations are intirely saved or at least much shortened and facilitated by bringing them to such small numbers as can be easily multiplied and divided mentally and the answer thence discovered without any other intermediate fi∣gures or operations to be written down So that there is never occasion for more writing than appears in the operations as here printed where it will be found that to avoid the long form of division the large divisors are separated into their component parts and the divisions performed separately by them which are always done by writing down only the quotients But where the numbers are so large as to make long divisions or multiplications unavoidable those ope∣rations are always placed down at the bottom of the solution that so none of the necessary part of the writing in the full solution might be omitted  A PROMISCUOUS COLLECTION  of  QUESTIONS  and their  SOLUTIONS

being s and the difference of the gains = s d s = s d = ¼s =  Therefore as ∶ or as ∶ or as ∶ ∷  QUESTION  Three persons entered joint trade to which A contri∣buted l and B l they clear l of which l belongs of right to C Required that person's stock and the several gains of the other two    Ans C  's stock l  A  gained l and  B  l  SOLUTION  First ==the sum of the gains of A and B  And + ==the sum of their stocks  Therefore as ∶ or as ∶ ∷  ∶ ==A's gain  ∶ ==B's gain  Also as ∶ or as ∶ ∷ ∶ =C's stock  QUESTION  A and B in partnership equally divide the gain A's money which was l s lay for months and B's for no more than What was the adventure of the lat∣ter  Ans  l s  SOLUTION  Since the two shares of the gain are equal by the rule of DoubleFellowship it appears that the two products are equal which are made by multiplying each stock by its time and consequently that the stocks are inversely or reciprocally as the times Hence  As ∶ or as ∶ ∷ l s ∶ l s × =l s=the sum adventured by B  QUESTION  Put out l to interest and in ½ years time there was sound to be due l s What was the rate of in∣terest  Ans    per cent  SOLUTION  First ½ =½=the interest of for ½ yrs Theref ½ ÷ ½= ÷ ==its interest for yr Then as ∶ or as ∶ ∷ ∶ Therefore the rate of interest was  per cent  QUESTION  A clears l in months B l in months and C whose stock was l c  s l in months What was the whole stock  Ans  l  SOLUTION  As ∶ = × or as ∶ ∷  the prod of A's stock and time  the prod of B's stock and time  Then  A's stock  B's stock  Lastly + + = + = + = = the sum of all their stocks as required  QUESTION  A had pipes of wine which he parted with to B at ½  per cent  profit who sold them to C for l s ad∣vantage C made them over to D for l s and cleared thereby  per cent  How much a gallon did this wine cost A  Ans  s d  SOLUTION  The pipes cost D l s  Therefore as ∶ or as  the sum they cost C  Consequently  the sum they cost B  Hence as  the sum the pipes cost A  The th part of this is = the price of pipe or gallons  Divide now the numerator by or by its component parts and and lastly divide by the denominator for the answer thus  QUESTION  A of Amsterdam orders B of London to remit to C of Paris at ½d ster a crown and to draw on D of Ant∣werp for the value at ½s slem a l ster but as soon as B received the commission the exchange was on Paris at d a crown Pray at what rate of exchange ought B to draw on D to execute his orders and be no loser    Ans  s d  SOLUTION  As  the answer required  QUESTION  A with intention to clear guineas on a bargain with B rates hops at d a lb which cost him ½d B apprized of that sets down malt which cost s a quarter at an adequate price For how much malt did they contract  Ans  qrs  SOLUTION  As  the gain  per  quarter  Then as  the number of quarters required  QUESTION  A and B venturing equal sums of money clear by joint trade l By agreement A was to have  per cent  because he spent time in the execution of the pro∣ject and B was to have only What was allotted to A for his trouble  Ans  l s d  SOLUTION  As  the answer required  QUESTION  Laid out in a lot of muslin l upon examination of which parts in proved damaged so that I could make but s a yard of the same and by so doing find I lost l by it At what rate  per  ell am I to part with the undamaged muslin in order to gain l upon the whole    Ans  s d  SOLUTION  In order to gain l by the whole he must gain l by the undamaged part because he lost l by the part which was damaged  Now the part damaged was ⅓ and the rest ⅔ also the whole cost l the ⅓ of which is ⅔ and the ⅔ of it is ⅓ Consequently the damaged part was sold for ⅔ or ⅔ and the sound part must be sold for ⅓=⅓ +  But the damaged part sold at s  per  yard therefore as s or ¼l ∶ ⅔l ∷ yd ∶ ⅔ × =⅔ yards the quantity which was damaged And the double of it or ⅓ yards was the undamaged part which must sell for ⅓l Therefore as ⅓ ∶ ∷ ⅓ ∶ ⅓ ⅓ = by multiplying the terms both by =l the price  per  yard  And consequently as  the price  per  ell required  OTHERWISE  Since the sound part is the double of the part damaged and the former must gain a sum just the double of that which was lost by the latter it is evident that  it  must be sold at a rate as much above the prime cost as the other was below it  Now the loss on ⅓ part was l at which rate the whole would have brought only therefore as ∶ or as ∶ ∷ s ∶ = s the prime cost per yard  Hence = =the loss  per  yard on the damaged part and + = s the price  per  yard of the sound part  Lastly as ∶ ∷ ∶ × = × =s the price  per  ell the same as before  QUESTION  A at Paris draws on B in London crowns at d ster a crown for the value of which B draws again on A at d sterl a crown besides reckoning commis∣sion ½  per cent  Did A gain or lose by this transaction and what  Ans  He gained crowns  SOLUTION  First × = pence the value of A's draft on B  Then as ∶ ½ or as ∶ ∷ ∶ × d=the sum that B must draw for at d  per  crown  Therefore as  crowns which B must draw for  Consequently = crowns is A's gain  QUESTION  A B and C are in company A put in his share of the stock for months and laid claim to ⅙ of the pro∣fits B put in his for months C advanced l for months and required on the balance ⅗ of the gain Required the stock of the other two adventurers    Ans A  l s d and  B  l s d  SOLUTION  First ⅙ + ⅗= + = the sum of the shares of the gain of A and C  Conseq ==the share of B And the gains of A B C are respectively proportional to the numbers  But the gains are as the products of the stocks and times and the product of C's stock and time is = × Therefore as ∶ or as ∶ ∷  ∶ =the prod of A's stock and time  ∶ =the prod of B's stock and time  These being divided by their respective times which are and months we have  =A's stock  =B's stock  QUESTION  A young hare starts yards before a greyhound and is not perceived by him till she has been up seconds she scuds away at the rate of miles an hour and the  dog on view makes after her at the rate of How long will the course hold and what ground will be run over beginning with the outsetting of the dog    Ans  sec and yards run  SOLUTION  First × ==the number of seconds in an hour And yards are a mile Therefore as ∶ or as ∶ ∷ × ∶ =the yards run by the hare before the dog starts Consequently  the distance of the hare before the dog when he starts and which therefore he must run more than she in order to overtake her  But in hour or seconds the dog runs miles or × yards more than the hare Therefore as  seconds the time of the dog's running  And consequently as  the whole space run by the dog  QUESTION  If A leave Exeter at o'clock on Monday morning for London and ride at the rate of miles an hour without intermission and B set out from London for Exeter at the same evening and ride miles an hour constantly  Supposing the distance between the two cities be miles whereabout on the road shall they meet    Ans  miles from Exeter  SOLUTION  From o'clock till o'clock are hours Therefore × = are the miles rode by A before B sets out from London And consequently = are the miles to travel between them after that  Hence as = + ∶ ∷ ∶ = miles more travelled by A at the meeting  Consequently + = miles from Exeter is the place of their meeting  QUESTION  A reservoir for water has two cocks to supply it by the first alone it may be filled in minutes by the se∣cond in min and it hath a discharging cock by which it may when full be emptied in min Now sup∣posing that these cocks are all left open and that the water comes in in what time supposing the influx and efflux of the water to be always alike would rhe cistern be filled  Ans  hrs min  SOLUTION  The rates of running are reciprocally as the times of filling Therefore the rate of increase of the influx over the efflux is as  which rate of increase is also reciprocally as the time of filling  Therefore the whole time of filling is minutes or hours minutes=the answer required  QUESTION  A sets out of London for Lincoln at the very same time that B at Lincoln sets forward for London distant miles After hours they meet on the road and it then appeared that A had road ½ miles an hour more than B At what rate an hour did each of them travel    Ans A  and  B  miles  SOLUTION  First × ½=½ miles which A travels more than B  Hence  travelled by A  And  travelled by B  Then dividing each distance by the time of travel∣ling we have  ¼ = = A's rate of travelling  ¾ = = B's rate of travelling  QUESTION  A and B truck A has ½ cwt of Farnham hops at l s a cwt but in barter insists on l B has wine worth s a gal which he raises in proportion to A's de∣mand On the balance A received but a hhd of wine What had he in ready money  Ans  l s d  SOLUTION  First ½ × =½l=l s is the amount of the hops  But as  the barter price  per  gallon of the wine Therefore  is the value of the hogshead of wine  Consequently the difference or l s l s d=l s d is the sum given in money  QUESTION  A of Amsterdam owes to B of Paris guilders of current specie which he is to remit to him by order the exchange d Flem  de banco  a crown the agio  per cent  but when this was to be negotiated the ex∣change was down at d a crown and the agio  per cent  What did B get by this turn of affairs    Ans  liv sol den  SOLUTION  First guilders= × = pence currency  And as ∶ ∷ ∶ = d banco  Then as  crowns the amount at the first exchange  Again as ∶ or as ∶ ∷ ∶ d banco  Then as ∶ ∷ cr= crowns the amount by the latter exchange  The difference or  is the sum gained by B  FINIS  ERRATUM  In the note to the equation of payments in the Arithmetic con∣taining Malcolm's rule the remark concerning a greater number of payments than two should be omitted as that method of equating for or more payments will not give the answer strictly true But in all such cases to obtain the just answer Malcolm's General Prin∣ciple of Solution ought to be used  viz  making the interests of the sums that are kept till after they are due equal to the discounts of those which are paid before they are due The resolution of the re∣sulting equation will indeed require some knowledge in Algebra but for ordinary purposes the rule in common use will bring out answers sufficiently near the truth  Lately published  In Six Volumes complete Price l s bound  THE DIARIAN MISCELLANY Consisting of all the useful and entertaining Parts
