BOOKSELLER CATHERINESTREET STRAND MDCCLXXVI Price SIXPENCE  ADVERTISEMENT  THE Drama of the BLACKAMOOR WASH'D WHITE was originally designed for a Comedy of two actsbut from the omission of a character of an extraordinary length agreeable to the judicious opinion of Mr Garrick it has been hastily converted since its first reception for the stage into the COMIC OPERA which now awaits the judgment of a candid English audience  Feb  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Frederic  Mr Vernon  Sir Oliver Oddfish  Mr Parsons  Grenvile  Mr Davies  Robert  Mr Burton  And Jerry  Mr King  Julia  Mrs Siddons  Lady Oddfish  Mrs Wrighten  Dame Dowset  Mrs Bradshaw  Servants c c  AIRS BALLADS c  ACT I  AIR I  MR PARSONS  LOOK ye here  Ay and there  Oh my ruin now is clear  For I've track'd him above and below  Hopes are vain  See its plain  Where he doubles back again  Like a frisky jackhare in the snow  AIR II  MR PARSONS  When a woman's brain teems  With such strange wanton dreams  And she tosses and turns in her bed  'Tis at least ten to one  But the husband's undone  Since the birth is design'd for  his  head  Mercy what have we here  I am pregnant I fear  My disorder no med'cine can cure  I feel such a shooting  I'm surely cornuting  Oh the labour how shall I endure  AIR III  MRS BRADSHAW  Tho' lords and ladies shine  In finer cloaths than mine  I have none of their cares for to flout me  I envy not their pelf  I'm a dutchess in myself  With my cocks and my hens all about me  AIR IV  MR DAVIES  Love and woman in unison play  To keep courtship's sky bright and clear  Ma'm's as gentle as May  Bills and coos all the day  Tho' discord is close in the rear  So Love's catering saucy sly pickle  The poison conceals of his dart  For first with the feather he'll tickle  And thenstrike the barb to your heart  AIR V  MR VERNON  The stream that environ'd her cot  All the charms of my deity knew  How oft has its course been forgot  While it paus'dher dear image to woo  Believe me the fond silver tide  Knew from whence it deriv'd the fair prize  For silently swelling with pride  It reflected herback to the skies  VI BALLAD  MR KING  I  When first I came hither to  sarvice  I thought I wou'd learn how to woo  So at Lammas I courted  Doll Jarvise  Oh there was the devil to do  Tho'f at first my poor heart she  denoy'd  it  She made it as sick as a dog  And like a  Jack Lantern  decoy'd it  With her eyesover briar and bog  II  Odsooks but the tit beat me hollow  She run me so soon off my wind  For the more little Jerry did follow  She left him the further behind  But one moonshiny night made me happy  For home in a tiff did I jog  And left  Doll  for to find a new  sappy  To dance over briar and bog  AIR VII  MRS WRIGHTEN  How weak the maid who's led astray  By state by wealth or fashion  Whose heart can never own their sway  For love's a gen'rous passion  Where shall the selfmade captive find  A joy that's worth the knowing  But from two hearts by love conjoin'd  What endless transports flowing  VIII BALLAD  MR KING  I  Must a Christian man's son born and bred up  By a  Negar  be flung in disgrace  Be asham'd for to hold his poor head up  'Ca'se as how he has got a white face  No never mind little  Jerry  Let your honest heart be merry  British boys  will still be right  Till they prove that  black  is  white  II  M'hap the nabob that brought the poor creature  From his father and mother and all  Is himself of a blackamoor nature  Dark within as the tribe of Bengal  So never mind it little  Jerry  Let your honest heart be merry  British boys  will still be right  Till they prove that  black  is  white  AIRS BALLADS c  ACT II  These stanzas the only air originally intended for the piece were written to the very celebrated  Gramachrie  long before it was known that the author of the  Duenna  intended to make use of it in his favourite opera  AIR IX  MR VERNON  WHEN JULIA sled her constant swain  How could she slight him so  I sought her steps o'er ev'ry plain  Opprest with love and woe  I hung my lyre upon a tree  And cry'd with aching heart  Ye Gods how cruel your decree  Must I and Julia part  In vain I search'd the beechen grove  'Till night had veil'd the skies  Ah where shone then those stars of love  The rays from Julia's eyes  The woodland caught the mournful strain  That wrung my aching heart  The livelong night I cry'd in vain  Must I and JULIA part  AIR X  MR VERNON  The schoolboy thus in highest glee  A like disaster meets  Who thinks to rob each active bee  Of all their treasur'd sweets  For instinct the design explores  The nest is all on wing  So that instead of honey'd stores  The thief receivesa  sting  AIR XI  MRS WRIGHTEN  For the fresh blooming spring nature sighs  When  Winter  that monster appears  Whose jealousy veils the bright skies  Lest they melt the cold locks round his ears  Though he pours hail and snow  And his blasts wildly blow  Not a subject his fury shall gain  Not a bud shall e'er shoot  Nor a blossom bear fruit  Not a sun shine to chear  His sad frostbitten year  Till the tyrant forego his fell reign  AIR XII  MRS WRIGHTEN  No you're not an earthly creature  But death's shadow in disguise  See him stamp'd on ev'ry feature  What a pair of rolling eyes  Don't come nigh me  Let me fly thee  Or I faintI fallI die  See death yonder  Now I wonder  Who outruns the ghostor I  AIR XIII  MR VERNON  I  Was e'er such a splenetic elf  What a whimsical figure of fun  Who baits the fool's trap for himself  And then cries aloud he's undone  Sure of folly's whole brood he's the first  Never was such an antic  Capricious  Suspicious  Ever jealous or frantic  I shall laugh at his tricks till I burst    Long as e'er by these megrums possest  What repose shall his bosom once find  'Tis an ocean that never can rest  Convuls'd with the storms of his mind  Was e'er such a splenetic elf  c    Da Capo  FINALE  DUET  MR DAVIES and MRS WRIGHTEN  Happy morn of love and joy  What shall Wedlock's bliss annoy  Hence afar Suspicion's flown  Hymen mark the day thy own  MR VERNON  Here my fault'ring tongue first woo'd thee  MRS SIDDONS  Here my ravish'd eyes first view'd thee  BOTH  Mark our love ye nymphs and swains  MRS SIDDONS  Here 'twas plighted  MR VERNON  Here requited  MR DAVIS and MRS WRIGHTEN  Tell it echo thro' the plains  CHORUS  Happy morn of love and joy  What shall WEDLOCK'S bliss annoy  Hence afar SUSPICION'S flown  HYMEN mark the day thy own  END
