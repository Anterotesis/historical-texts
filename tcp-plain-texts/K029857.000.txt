 LONDON  Sept    THE CASE OF  Samuel Richardson  of  London  Printer With regard to the INVASION of his PROPERTY IN The History of Sir Charles Grandison Before PUBLICATION By certain BOOKSELLERS in  Dublin  THE EDITOR of The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON had intended to send the Volumes of it as he did those of the HISTORY of CLARISSA HARLOWE to be printed in  Ireland  before he published them himself in  London  Accordingly when he had printed off so considerable a Part of the Work as would have constantly employed the Press to which he purposed to consign them he sent over Sheets of the First Volume to Mr  George Faulkner  intending to follow it with the rest as Opportunity offered  He had heard an  Irish  Bookseller boast some Years ago That he could procure from any PrintingOffice in  London  Sheets of any Book printing in it while it was going on and before Publication and Mr  Faulkner  cautioning him on this Subject with regard to this Work he took particular Care to prevent as he hoped the Effects of such an infamous Corruption as it must be called since it could not be done but by bribing the Journeymen or Servants of the  London  Printer He gave a strict Charge before he put the Piece to Press to all his Workmen and Servants as well in PRINT that it might the stronger impress them as by Word of Mouth to be on their Guard against any outdoor Attacks This was the Substance of the printed Caution which he gave to his Workmen on this Occasion  "A Bookseller of  Dublin  has assured me That he could get the Sheets of any Book from any Printinghouse in  London  before Publication I hope I may depend upon the Care and Circumspection of my Friends Compositors and Pressmen that no Sheets of the Piece I am now putting to Press be carried out of the House nor any Notice taken of its being at Press It is of great Consequence to me Let no Stranger be admitted into any of the Workrooms Once more I hope I may rely on the Integrity and Care of all my WorkmenAnd let all the Proofs Revises  c  be given to Mr  Tewley  " his Foreman "to take care of"  He had no Reason to distrust their Assurances most of them being Persons of experienced Honesty and was pleased with their declared Abhorrence of so vile a Treachery and of all those who should attempt to corrupt them Yet to be still more secure as he thought he ordered the Sheets as they were printed off to be deposited in a  separate  Warehouse the Care of which was entrusted to One on whom he had laid such Obligations as if he is guilty has  made his Perfidy a Crime of the blackest Nature  Peter Bishop  whose Business was to read Proofs to the Corrector and to employ his Leisure Hours in the Warehouses and who and no other Person being entrusted with the Sheets of Sir  Charles Grandison  as wrought off and to layby Three Sheets of each of the Twelves Edition and One of the Octavo for Mr  Richardson  's sole Use had an Opportunity which no other Man however inclined could have to perpetrate this Baseness  Mr  Richardson  on Suspicions too wellgrounded dismissed  Bishop  from his Service and after he was gone having Reason to suspect  Thomas Killingbeck  one of his Compositors as the Confederate of  Bishop  and by whose means he having worked some Years in  Ireland  it was easy for him to manage this Piece of Treachery and  Killingbeck  on Examination giving him Cause to strengthen his Suspicions yet asserting his Innocence he proposed to him the said  Killingbeck  to draw up  himself  such an Affidavit as he thought he could safely take to exculpate himself  Killingbeck  made poor Excuses and Pretences but at last took till the next Morning to draw it up The next Morning he told Mr  Richardson  that he was advised not to draw up such an Affidavit and gave such evasive Reasons as induced every body to believe him guilty Upon this Mr  Richardson  discharged him from his Service He left his House pretending he would draw up something as desired but never since came near it and is now applying for Work elsewhere  Since writing the above Mr  Richardson  has received a Letter from  Bishop  on Occasion of some Friend of his advising him to an ample Confession and to depend on that forgiving Temper which he had before experienced in which he offers Circumstances to prove that  Killingbeck  might find Opportunities to steal the Sheets without his Connivance tho' were  that  the Case none after such repeated Warnings and Cautions to clear himself of the most culpable Negligence  Having Three Printinghouses he had them composed and wrought by different Workmen and at his different Houses and took such other Precautions that the Person to whose Trust he committed them being frequently questioned by him as to the Safety of the Work from Pirates  as  frequently assured him That it was impossible the Copy of any complete Volume could be come at were there Persons in his House capable of being corrupted to attempt so vile a Robbery  What then must be his Surprize when Intelligence was sent him from  Dublin  That Copies of a considerable Part of his Work had been obtained by Three different Persons in that City and that the Sheets were actually in the Press The  honest  Men published their own Names in Three different TitlePages stuck up in  Dublin  in the following Words  "  Dublin Aug    Speedily will be published  The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON In a Series of Letters Published from the Originals By the EDITOR of PAMELA and CLARISSA In Seven Volumes  Dublin  Printed by and for HENRY SAUNDERS at the Corner of  ChristChurchLane  "  The Second  "  Aug  th In the Press The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON" as in the other "  Dublin  Printed by JOHN EXSHAW on  Corkhill  "  The Third  "  Dublin Aug  th  In the Press and speedily will be published  The HISTORY of Sir CHARLES GRANDISON" as in the Two others "  London  Printed for  S Richardson  " Vile Artifice "  Dublin  Reprinted for PETER WILSON in  Damestreet  "  The Editor had  convincing  Proofs given him that one of these Men had procured a Copy of a considerable Part of the Work in  Octavo  another in  Duodecimo  and that they were proceeding to print it at several Presses  Terms having been agreed upon between Mr  Faulkner  and the Editor in Consideration of the Preference to be given him One of which related to the Time of publishing the  Dublin  Edition that it might not interfere with the Appearance of the  London  one Mr  Faulkner  in consequence of the successful Corruption signified to the Editor that it was needless to send him any more than the Sheets he  had  sent him and that he had obtained a Fourth Share of these  honourable  Confederates But that to procure this Grace as is supposed he had been  compelled  as he calls it to deliver up to them to print by the Copy of the Sheets aforesaid which had some few Corrections in them which occurred on a last Revisal but which are of no Moment with regard to the History Tho' possibly this  worthy  Confederacy may make use of those few Corrections in those Sheets in order to recommend their surreptitious Edition as preferable to that of the Proprietor Of what will not Men be capable who can corrupt the Servants of another Man to betray and rob their Master  The Editor who had also great Reason to complain of the Treatment he met with in his  Pamela  on both Sides the Water cannot but observe that never was Work more the Property of any Man than  this  is his The Copy never was in any other Hand He borrows not from any Author The Paper the Printing entirely at his own Expence to a very large Amount Returns of which he cannot see in several Months Yet not troubling any of his Friends to lessen his Risque by a Subscription The Work Copies of which have been so  immorally  obtained is a  moral  Work He has never hurt any Man nor offended these They would have had Benefits from the Sale which the Editor could not have being not a Bookseller and he always making full and handsome allowances  to  Booksellers  But nothing less it seems would content these Men than an Attempt to possess themselves of his whole Property without Notice Leave Condition or Offer at Condition and they are hastening the Work at several Presses possibly with a View to publish their piratical Edition before the lawful Proprietor can publish his And who can say that if they can get it out before him they will not advertise that  his  is a Piracy upon  theirs  Yet these Men know that they have obtained the Parts of the Work they are possessed of at the Price of making an innocent Man unsafe in his own House and of dishonouring him in the Opinion of his Employers who probably may not choose to trust their Property in the Hands of a Man who cannot secure his own from intestine Traitors  Since the above was written Mr  Richardson  has been acquainted that his Work is now printing at Four several Printinghouses in  Dublin  for the Benefit of the Confederacy  viz  Two Volumes at Mrs  Reiley  's One at Mr  Williamson  's One at Mr  Powell  's One at Mr  M'Culloch  's and that they hope at Mrs  Reiley  's to get another Volume to print and are driving on to finish their Two Volumes for that Purpose  The Work will make Seven Volumes in  Twelves  Six in  Octavo  and he apprehends from the Quantity he himself had printed when the Fraud was discovered that the Confederacy have got Possession of Five entire Volumes the greatest Part of the Sixth and of several Sheets of the Seventh and last but the Work being stopt when the Wickedness was known they cannot have the better Half of the concluding Volume  He is further assured that these worthy Men are in Treaty with Booksellers in  Scotland  for their printing his Work in that Part of the United Kingdom from Copies that they are to furnish and also that they purpose to send a Copy to  France  to be translated there before Publication No doubt for pecuniary Considerations and in order to propagate to the utmost the Injury done to One who never did any to them and who till this Proceeding he blesses God knew not that there were such Men in the World among those who could look out in broad and open Day  It has been customary for the  Irish  Booksellers to make a Scramble among themselves who should first intitle himself to the Reprinting of a new  English  Book and happy was he who could get his Agents in  England  to send him a Copy of a supposed saleable Piece  as soon as it was printed  and  ready to be published  This Kind of Property was never contested with them by Authors  in England  and it was agreed among  themselves    i e  among the  Irish  Booksellers and Printers to be a  sufficient  Title tho' nowandthen a  Shark  was found who preyed on  his own Kind  as the Newspapers of  Dublin  have testified But the  present  Case will shew to what a Height of Baseness such an undisputed Licence is arrived  After all if there is no Law to right the Editor and sole Proprietor of this new Work  New  in every Sense of the Word he must acquiesce but with this Hope that from so flagrant an Attempt a Law may one Day be thought necessary in order to secure to Authors the Benefit of their own Labours Nor does he wish that even these Invaders of his Property in  Ireland  may be excluded from the Benefit of it in the Property of any of the Works to which they are or shall be fairly and lawfully intitled At present the  English Writers  may be said from the Attempts and Practices of the  Irish  Booksellers and Printers to live in an Age of  Liberty  but not of  Property  N B  This is not a Contention between Booksellers of  England  and  Ireland  and on a  doubtful  Property but between a lawful Proprietor of a  New  and  Moral  Work AND  Let Messieurs  Wilson Exshaw  and  Saunders  reflecting upon the Steps they have taken and making the Case  their own  for they no doubt have Servantsfill up the Blank  CASE OF
