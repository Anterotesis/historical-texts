 THE EXPERIMENT OR THE  Shortest Way with the Dissenters  EXEMPLIFIED Being the CASE of Mr  Abraham Gill  a Dissenting Minister in the Isle of  Ely  AND A Full Account of his being sent for a SOLDIER by Mr  Fern  an Ecclesiastical Justice of Peace and other CONSPIRATORS  To the Eternal Honour of the Temper and Moderation of High Church Principles  Humbly Dedicated to the QUEEN  London  Printed And Sold by  B Bragg  at the  BlueBall  in  AveMaryLane  MDCCV  TO THE QUEEN  MADAM  THis Dedication is not so much a Compliment to your Person as an Appeal to your Justice  Your Protestant Dissenting Subjects have your Sacred Promise of Protection they behaving themselves Dutifully and Peaceably to your Government and Obedient to the Laws And  Madam  as they cannot be so ignorant of their own Happiness under your gentle Government or so blind to their own Interest as to forfeit your Favour by any breach of their Duty so they cannot doubt of the full Performance on your Majesty's part of all that your Majesty has been graciously pleas'd to assure them of under the Sanction of your Royal Word  The Toleration of their religious Liberty has been secur'd to them by Law and your Majesty has been pleas'd to add to the Force of that Law your Royal Word that it shall be inviolably preserv'd  Your Majesty's Protestant Dissenting Subjects lay at your Feet the following Relation with all Humility appealing to your Royal Judgment whether both their Toleration is not herein violently invaded and your Majesty's Honour and sacred Promise at least attempted to be violated in the illegal arbitrary Methods made use of to oppress one of their Ministers and suppress an Assembly of several Hundreds of your Loyal and Peaceable Dissenting Subjects  They remonstrate and in the humblest manner Complain to your Majesty of the Violence and horrid Practices made use of to Defame Persecute Imprison and Ruin a Man whose principal visible Crime is Serving God according to his Conscience and Teaching the same to others They humbly present themselves at your Royal Feet as wounded through the sides of this injur'd Person and are your Majesty's humble Petitioners that you will be graciously pleas'd to testifie your Dislike of the Oppressions and Injustice of their Enemies in such manner as to your great Wisdom shall seem meet  In your Majesty's Favour and Justice they hope for exemplar Animadversions on these unchristian Practices and have a full Confidence in your Royal Promise that they shall not be abridg'd of nor ill treated for that Liberty which being settled first by

conformable to Truth and direct Meaning being at all times ready to come forth and confront even in your Royal Presence all the Allegations to the contrary  Having thus publickly appeal'd to God and your Majesty they can no longer Doubt either of the Blessing from above or the Protection and Assistance of your Majesty below and as your Throne has been a famous Refuge to apprest Innocence and Virtue in all Nations so they doubt not but your own Subjects shall yet have the Honour and Happiness of your powerful Protection as far as Justice and Law is on their side  Nor are they the less confident of your Majesty's Protection for their differing in Judgment from some few Points profess'd and practis'd by the Church of  England  of which your Majesty is the glorious Head since the Evils they complain of are suffer'd not from the Church of  England  as such whom they honour and with whom they covet to live in Charity Union and Peace but by ill Men who making the Church Religion

Persecution the Actions of these Men therefore however shelter'd under your Authority and the Wings of the Church will appear to your Majesty affrontive of your Goodness and highly derogating from the Christian Spirit the Church of  England  professes the Truth of which we humbly submit to Your Majesty's Wisdom to Discover and to your Justice to Resent as you shall find Cause  And are  c  Lately Published  THE Double Welcome  A Poem to the Duke of  Marlborough  By the Author of  The Trueborn Englishman  Sold by  B Bragg  at the  BlueBall  in  AveMaryLane  INTRODUCTION  IN the unhappy Differences between the HighChurch Party and the Dissenters it has happen'd as it generally does in all Heats and Animosities of Parties that both Sides pretend to be in the right and both pretend to be abus'd by the other  The warm Men of the Church have charg'd the Dissenters with Associating to Destroy and Undermine the Church How they have made good their Charge is not the business of this Paper and has been examin'd elsewhere  The Dissenters charge the other with Insulting them Persecuting them and Invading their Toleration  Great Endeavours have been us'd to defend the Occasional Bills from a Charge of Persecution and whether they have done that or no we need not dispute but refer to the Conferences on that Head between the Houses and which are publish'd in Print  But to leave all doubtful Cases to stand and fall by the Force of their own Truth I cannot think the World ought to be ignorant of the following Story that all unbyass'd People may see by this Specimen what these Gentlemen would do with the Dissenters if it lay in their power and how justly they have been charg'd with designs to Hang Banish and Destroy the Dissenters and reward their Ministers with the Gallows and the Galleys  And because I am going to present the World with a new  Devil of Loudon  with a Story so black in all its Parts so much the Picture of Hell and so aggravated with inhumane and unchristian Circumstances that all that read it must blush for their Native Country to think such unheardof Villanies could be acted in it Crimes so abhorr'd by Mankind that tho' they call themselves of the Church we shall find all the true Members of the Church whether Judges Justices Bishops yea even Jaylors themselves abhorring it while I say I have such a Scene before me and knowing what sort of People I have to do with I shall take such an  exact care to have every thing that is here advanc'd so attested with undeniable Evidence that Impudence it self not the hellish Actors not the blindest Advocates not the Devil himself shall dare to Reply to it  Slander and Lies fly befoe Truth as Mist before the Sun and this hellish Association form'd against an innocent Man tho' laid as deep as Hell and prosecuted thro' all the barbarous Extremes of Forgery Perjury Violence Subornation Insults and Revenge yet at last all dwindles away before Truth Innocence breaks out like the Sun thro' a dark Cloud the Light of Truth is so clear that Devils shun it Monsters fly from it and Men of Guilt and Blood hide their Heads at its appearance  And as I should not have attempted this Relation had I not had good and undoubted Testimony of the Truth of every Article so I write with the greater Assurance since I can frankly defie the most harden'd Advocate of such a wretched Cause to confront the least or minutest Circumstance  Such direct Testimony such just Authorities such authentick Proofs of every Article are before me that no Man could ever desire to have his Reputation vindicated with more Clearness in the Face of the Sun  As for the Treatment this poor injur'd Man has met with I would be glad the worst Enemy in the Nation would give it a Name and tell us wiht some little Reason at the same time what to call it  I would have them rummage  Fox  's History of the Popish Persecutions and tell us where they can match the Usage this Man has met with and let us know where ever Bishop  Gardiner  or bloody  Bonner  acted like These Men  Let them shew us such an Ecclesiastical Magistrate as Parson  Eern  and where ever Englishmen have been thus treated  Well might the Parliament pass a Bill to qualifie Justices of the Peace If this be the fruit of putting Church Parsons into Commissions of the Peace never let  Hudibras  tell us of the Cobler of  NewEngland  who  Serv'd his Country in a double  Capacity to Preach and Cobble  To let the Reader gradually into this black Story it is necessary to inform him that in several publick Printed Books as well as in common Discourse the Town has been possess'd with a Story of a Dissenting Minister in the  Isle of Ely  who first forg'd Episcopal  Orders and preach'd in the Church but being detected in that pretended Classical Ordination and set up a Conventicle but being prosecuted as a scandalous Fellow having two or three Wives four or five Bastards having once broke out of  Derby  Jayl play'd a great many villainous Pranks and being a common Drunkard and Swearer the Justices took him up as a Vagabond listed him for a Soldier and sent him away to  Cambridge  where having been Arrested for Debt and thereby got out of the Officer's hands some Complaints being made by the Dissenters at the Injustice of thisThe Party greet them by way of Answer with prodigious Calumnies and insolent Reproaches of the Man himself to vindicate the most villainous unheardof Proceedings that ever this Nation knew  And as the abominable Insolence of their Actions happen'd to receive a due Censure from the best Lord Chief Justice and of the most unspotted Character this Age has known let us see how this Person as well as the poor Sufferer is treated on this account by that Man of Fury and Satyr Mr  D  in the Preface to his Lampoon call'd  Moderation Display'd  Inveighing against our Men of Moderation in the Church he says  "Nay so tender are they of their Dissenting Brethren that I am told it has lately been delivered as Law by a great Man in  W  hall  That a notorious perjur'd Vagabond with two Wives at once being possest of a separate Congregation tho' without any Licence or legal Qualification to preach to them shall for that reason only be exempt from the late Act for Listing Vagrants"  Now if upon reading these Sheets it should  so fall out  that after all that has been done or said to or of this poor injur'd Man it should appear too plain for the most harden'd Lampooner or most impudent ChurchJustice to deny that this is all Malice Forgery and Injustice and as all the Judges of the Queen'sBench exprest it the deepest Track of Villainy that ever came before them What will these Men say for themselves and how will they make Satisfaction to God or Man to the affronted Dissenters to their own expos'd Party and to the poor injur'd Man that has been inhumanely treated  If after all their Clamour and barbarous Orders I make it appear that this Man never broke out of  Derby  or any other Jayl never forg'd any Orders but was fairly ordain'd by a Church of  England  Bishop ws never Perjur'd or a Vagabond had never two Wives at once nor any Bastards was never seen to be Drunk  or known to Swear but that on the contrary has been always a sober vertuous and peaceable Liver a constant Resident at his Cure for eleven or twelve Years together a Man of Charity and good Conversation and in short not in the least guilty of one of the Crimes charg'd on him but that it has been all Forgery Malice and Conspiracy to ruin him meerly for his quitting the Church and turning to the Dissenters  If this should happen to be made out as I fairly undertake it shall I crave Leave to draw these two Inferences  Those Dissenters who too hastily believ'd and too readily handed on the Clamours and Slanders against an innoceut Man through whose Sides they were all wounded and aim'd it ought to acknowledge their want of Consideration and Caution 'Tis true it may be said in their Excuse they could not have imagin'd the Earth had borne such Monsters and that such a Cloud of Clamours could never be all forg'd and therefore in Charity to the Churchmen they were drawn in to Censure an Innocent Man for which they ought to ask his Pardon and restoring him to their just Opinion more diligently guard for the future his injur'd Reputation  As to the Forgers of all this and the Authors of a Treatment too foul to relate and blacker than the Ink I write it with I leave their Character to season the Pallate of the Reader after he has been fill'd with Horror at some of the most villainous Actions the World ever heard of The Matter of Fact is as follows  The CASE of Mr  ABRAHAM GILL    c  ABraham Gill  the Subject of the ensuing Tragedy was a Minister of the Church of  England  He was born in  Rivington  in the County of  Lancaster  had his Education partly among the Dissenters but last of all in the University of  Oxford  where he commenc'd Batchelor of Arts of  BrazenNose  College  From whence Conforming to the Church of  England  he entred into Holy Orders and was admitted by the present Right Reverend the Bishop of  Chester  And because his Enemies have had the face to Charge him with forging the Bishop's Orders We think it necessary that we may clear every thing as we go along having abundance of dark things to expose and Hellish Conduct to lay open to draw this Scene  before we proceed and to tell them that the very Original Orders Signed by the Bishop of  Chester  's own Hand and Seal'd with his Seal is left with the rest of the Vouchers of this horrid Transaction at Mr  John Skey  's Tobacconist at the  Blackboy and Three Tobaccopipes  at  Queenhithe  where all the World Friends or Enemies are promised a free and uninterrupted Opportunity to see them and detect the Forgeries if they are to be found  And that it may not be alledg'd this Freedom of offering a sight of the Originals is but a presumptive Proof supposing no Man will trouble himself to examine them  tho' the Willingness of some Gentlemen to expose the Dissenters in this honest Man's Cause suggests otherwise  yet eternally to stop the Mouth of the most prepossess'd Malice a Reverend Clergyman of their own Church is to be found honest enough to do Justice to an injur'd Man and give a Sanction to the Truth  This Gentleman is one who entred into Orders with Mr  Gill  and five Ministers more at the same time and has honestly sworn it which Affidavit is left also with the rest of the Vouchers at the Place aforesaid And now if these Orders are Counterfeit or Forg'd it may fairly be seen and Mr  Gill  be expos'd but if not let the World match the villainous Usage this poor Man has met with if they can  After this Demonstration of the Certainty and undoubted Truth of his Orders 'tis humbly desir'd of all those Gentlemen that shall for the future charge him with forging Episcopal Orders that they would be pleas'd to shew their Faces that we may see if they do not blush and that they would tell us their Names that after some few Examples of this sort made for Satisfaction to Justice and the Law out of the great Number of those that are already detected they may be recorded as they deserve among those that  bear false Witness against their Neighbours  To proceed to the History of Mr  Gill  After he had thus enter'd into Orders he preach'd as Curate at  Maney  in the  Isle of Ely  about Miles from  Wisbich  While he Officiated in this Place he was well receiv'd and belov'd of his Congregation and we never find any Complaint made of him save that he set an ill Example to his Neighbours of the Clergy by invading the Custom of the Country and Preaching twice a day to the People  Having been two Years in  Maney  he received an Invitation from the Inhabitants of  Welney  or  Welneth  a Hamlet in the Parish of  Upwell  in the same County to preach in a certain Privileg'd  Independent Chapel in this Parish the Right of the Place empowering the Inhabitants to choose their own Minister  After long and earnest Sollicitations from the Inhabitants of  Wilney  and with the Consent of his former Hearers he agreed to go to  Wilney  and accordingly went and settled with his Family in the Parsonagehouse or Tenement belonging to the said Chapel  The Freedom with which the Inhabitants of  Wilney  invited Mr  Gill  to be their Curate appear'd in their chearful assisting him in his Removal thither and preparing a Feast for his Reception all the Neighbours in general meeting him to bid him Welcome  About a Fortnight or Threeweeks after his Settlement at  Wilney  the Reverend Dr  Gregg  Rector of  Upwell  came to pay him a Visit thank'd him for coming to the said Chapel and declared that he was glad his Parishioners were like to be so well serv'd  In this Chapel Mr  Gill  continued about seven Years  viz  from the Year to the Year Preaching twice a day and Conforming in all things to the Usage of the Church of  England  But in process of Time being dissatisfied in his Conscience at the Use of the Liturgy he began at several times to omit such part of the Service as he dislik'd till at last his Scruples encreasing he wholly omitted the Common Prayer applying himself only to the Pulpit and conceiving he was not under equal Obligation as if Preaching in a ParishChurch the Chapel he preach'd in being wholly Independent a Privileg'd Place and in the Power of the People  As this was the Original of all the subsequent Malice of the ChurchClergy and of the barbarous Proceedings of which we are to give an Account so they are hereby fairly challeng'd to produce one Shadow of a Crime in his Behaviour which Humane Frailty excepted appears wholly blameless and which we shall produce such Testimonials to justifie as few of the Clergy of the Church can produce more and such as indeed no honest Man need desire better  If this Offence were as great as they would suppose it to be it yet admits of much to be said in Extenuation as I His Scruples of Conscience which would not permit him to continue the Exercise of the Common Prayer and Ceremonies at least not in all parts His officiating in a private Independent Chapel in which as before he thought himself not oblig'd to an exact and compleat Conformity  But to oblige our Adversary we'll suppose it as heinous a Crime as they can pretend to yet they will have enough to do  to make it out that their Proceedings with him have been legal rational just or humane And for the Truth of this Suggestion we refer to the Particulars and freely make all unprejudic'd Members of their own Church the Judges this Independency of the Chapel of  Wilney  will in some measure appear as follows  Dr  Gregg  the Rector of  Upwell  understanding that Mr  Gill  omitted the Common Prayer came to him and told him he was sorry he Mr  Gill  did not hold to his Principles  c  and that he must therefore dispossess him and put in another Curate  But Mr  Gill  replied He was not nor ever had been his Curate and that it was not in his Dr  Gregg  's Power to dispossess him and therewith Mr  Gill  shew'd the Doctor  his Authority for holding  the Place which satisfied Dr  Gregg  so that he never offer'd him the least Disturbance afterward  After some time Dr  Gregg  died and the Rectory of  Upwell  was given to one Mr  Hubbart  but he being a weakly Man and in a deep Consumption he put in a Curate to Officiate  viz  one Mr  Hugh James  This Mr  James  finding his Parishioners flocking after Mr  Gill  and but few caring to hear him he exprest his Displeasure frequently in threatning and malicious Speeches against Mr  Gill  but the Incumbent Mr  Hubbart  being a pious and peaceable Man would not permit him to molest Mr  Gill  during his Life but this was not long for in about a Year and a half the said Mr  Hubbart  the Rector of  Upwell  died and the Living was then given to the said Curate Mr  Hugh James  As this Mr  James  was a Man both of a different Temper and Character from his two honest Predecessors he resolv'd to strain his Authority to the utmost in order to dispossess Mr  Gill  The first Step he took in this Undertaking was that about the  He comes to  Wilney  on a Lord'sday and demands the Pulpit for the morning Mr  Gill  quietly permitted him to Preach which he did or rather Rail at an uncommon rate against Mr  Gill  bending his whole Discourse to set out the heinous Sin of Omitting the holy Ceremonies and telling Mr  Gill  from the Pulpit that he ought to lie at the Chapeldoor for three or four Months in Sackcloth not daring to tread upon that Consecrated Ground begging the People to pray to God for him to forgive him that Sin and to prove this quoted as we are told several Popish Writers but not one Text of Scripture as can be remembred running on in such a virulent Stile and unsuitable manner that many of the Inhabitants could not bear to hear him but went out of the Chapel  In the Afternoon there was no Sermon for the said Mr  James  Rector of  Upwell  gave notice to the People to meet him after Dinner at an Alehouse where he Treated them with Liquor and as a place more proper for the Subject preach'd the Second Part to his Morning Sermon and bestow'd another plentiful storm of ill Language on Mr  Gill  desiring the Inhabitants to set their Hands to a Letter Petition or Paper written to the  Bishop  in order to get Mr  Gill  turn'd out But they all unanimously refus'd him  Being disappointed in his Expectations and having spent his Breath as well as Ale to no purpose he went as is reported that very Night to  Ely  and the next Week to  London  to complain against Mr  Gill  to the  Bishop  of  Norwich  The Inhabitants of  Wilney  having discovered the Design and being very loth to part with their Minister importun'd Mr  Gill  to draw up a Petition to the Lord  Bishop  of  Norwich  in order to prevent Mr  James  from obtaining his malicious Design  Mr  Gill  at the Desire of his Congregation did draw up the said Petition which was Sign'd by near Hands of the Inhabitants of  Wilney  and sent up to the Lord  Bishop  of  Norwich  by the Post who receiv'd it as is supposed before the said Mr  James  got thither  Soon after the Arrival of the Petition the Rector Mr  James  came up to the  Bishop  and makes his Complaint against Mr  Gill  desiring he might be dismist but his Lordship as Mr  James  himself has reported answer'd That he had heard a very good Report of the said Mr  Gill  from his Neighbourhood That by the Right of the Place the Choice of a Minister was in the Inhabitants and they testifying to his Behaviour he could not dismiss him or credit the Accusation of one Man against the unanimous Voice of the whole Town or Words to that effect But in short he rejected the Request of Mr  James  and refus'd to Censure or Dispossess Mr  Gill  Mr  James  finding himself disappointed here applies himself to the Spiritual Court at  Norwich  and about  May  procures a Citation against Mr  Gill  to appear at  Norwich  Mr  Gill  obey'd the Citation very readily appear'd at  Norwich  and retain'd one Mr  Batchelour  as his Proctor to manage his Defence  Mr  James  finding himself still defeated and not venturing to proceed in the  Bishop  's Court at  Norwich  let drop his Citation and ceas'd his Prosecution till about  August  when he serv'd Mr  Gill  with another Citation  While this was depending Mr  Gill  going to  Cambridge  to Vote in the Election of Knights of the Shire being possest of a Glebe to the Chapel as a Freehold came into the Company of Sir  R  Jen  gs  Knight who pretending Friendship to Mr  Gill  and his Neighbours who were there present began to perswade them to part quietly and lovingly and to avoid continual Fewds perswaded Mr  Gill  to quit the Chapel of  Wilney  as a Place not worth so much Fewd and Contest and upon his doing so he promis'd  he would engage on the behalf of Mr James  the Suit in the Spiritual Court should go no farther  Mr  Gill  consented and tho' much against the minds of the Inhabitants agreed to leave  Wilney  and depending on the Promise of Sir  R Jen  gs  omitted any regard of the Suit at  Norwich  where for want of his appearing and  that worthy Knight breaking his word with him  they proceeded to Excommunication against him  Mr  Gill  having thus quitted his Charge had a Call from  Lincolnshire  to a Dissenting Congregation which Call after some time he accepted and accordingly remov'd to go thither And here 'tis necessary to advertise the Reader that Mr  Gill  was so far from a hasty Flight or any precipitance in his Remove that he was near ten Weeks resolving removing and settling his Family in  Lincolnshire  In this Interval and when it is plain these Gentlemen themselves knew every day where to find Mr  Gill  and that he was frequently in the Town of  Wilney  and never conceal'd himself or absconded from any body yet even then one of the most impudent Forgeries that can be paralell'd in this Age was practis'd upon him  viz  To publish in the  Gazette  that the said Mr  Gill  was fled from Justice having been detected of Forgery  c  And because the barefac'd piece of Villainy shall admit no Misconstruction we have here transmitted it to the World Word for Word as it stands in the  Gazette  and as Care will speedily be taken to make the proper Persons account for itas follows  Gazette    Thursday Nov  Advert  WHereas  Abraham Gill  aged upward of Years middlestatur'd having some grey Hairs sometimes wearing a light Wig of a sanguine Complexion bold and confident in Conversation of a strong Voice and a Northcountry  Pronunciation    writing a tolerable Clerks hand  as having been sometime employed under an Attorney but lately  officiating as Curate at  Welney  in the Isle of  Ely  belonging to the Rectory of  Upwell  in  Norfolk  has been detected of Forging Letters of Orders under the Hand and Episcopal Seal of the Right Reverend Father in God  Nicholas  Lord Bishop of  Chester  and being for that and other wicked and scandalous Practices prosecuted in the Lord Bishop of  Norwich  's Consistory Court is fled from Justice all Clergymen are to take notice not to entertain the said  Gill  as a Curate or suffer him to perfom any holy Office And whoever gives notice of him so as he may be Prosecuted either to Mr  Hugh James  Rector of  Upwell  or to Mr  Robert Clark  at the Consistory Court aforesaid in  Norwich  shall have a good Reward for the same  Gazette    Monday March  ABraham Gill  aged upwards of Years middlestatur'd some grey Hairs wearing sometimes a light Wig sometimes a darker sanguine Complexion bold and confident in Conversation strong Voice a NorthCountry Pronunciation writing a Clerklike Hand as having been sometime employed under an Attorney travelling the Country with a Woman and three or four Children some time since forged Letters of Orders under the Hand and Episcopal Seal of the Lord Bishop of  Chester  and for some time Officiated as Curate at  Welney  in the  Isle of Ely  belonging to the Rectory of  Upwell  in  Norfolk  until the Forgery was detected for which and other wicked and scandalous Practices being Prosecuted in the Consistory Court at  Norwich  he fled from Justice Since which time he hath forged other Letters of Orders under the Bishop of  Ely's  Hand and Episcopal Seal which were discovered to be Counterfeit upon his producing them at  Bollingbrook  in  Lincolnshire  where he offered himself to be Curate upon which being again taken into Custody he hath again made his Escape All Clergymen are therefore desired not to entertain the said  Gill  as a Curate or suffer him to perform any Holy Office And whoever gives notice of him so as he may be secur'd to Mr  Hugh James  Rector of  Upwell  or to Mr  Robert Clark  Proctor in  Norwich  shall have a good Reward for the same  Mr  Gill  has been inform'd this black piece of Malice had its birth in  Jesus College  in  Cambridge  concerted there between Dr  Cook  Dr  James  Mr  Lateward  and their Confederates but as he is not positive in that he shall be glad of an Occasion to ask their Pardon for the Suggestion when they shall have purg'd themselves honourably from the Suspicion and till then thinks the  Grounds he has for his Opinion are sufficient to clear him of any breach of Charity in believing it  Mr  Gill  was with his Family upon the Road from  Wilney  into  Lincolnshire  when this Publication was first made and coming to  Boston  on a ThanksgivingDay he rested and went to the Dissenting Meeting to hear the Sermon when after Sermon Mr  Keeling  the Minister took him home to his House and shew'd him the  Gazette  with the aforesaid Advertisement in it  Mr  Gill  surpriz'd at the Reading of this  Gazette  as he well might immediately took Horse leaving his Family in  Boston  and resolv'd to go to  Cambridge  where he expected to find out the bottom of the matter  In this place it will be necessary to leave Mr  Gill  a while and the Reader may suppose him Travelling to  Cambridge  with a Heart full of Trouble to see himself persecuted with so much Malice and in hopes to find out his Enemies and their Design And while he is on the Road let us enquire upon what sorry and sandy Foundation all this Fabrick of Malice and Folly was erected which will at last tend to lessen the Wonder at the Authors being confounded in their own Devices  There had been a Man in  Derby  Jayl whose Name was  Gill    but to avoid all possible Cavil 'tis noted his Name was not  ABRAHAM GILL  but  Stephen Clifford  alias  Gill This Man having been Committed for Forging Holy Orders and Counterfeiting the Coins and Convicted of both had broke out of the County Jayl at  Derby  and was fled from Justice  Mr  James  the Rector of  Upwell  having been inform'd of this by his Attorney immediately fixes it upon Mr  Gill    and he must be the Man  And to bring this Plot to a Head takes the pains about  June  to send to  Derby  and informing the Jaylor there that his Prisoner was found procures two Men to be sent from  Derby  to seize him and so sure was he of his Game that he openly gave it out that Mr  Gill  had broke out of Jayl and he should be hang'd  Accordingly the two Men sent by the Jaylor came over to  Wilney  and pretending extraordinary Business with Mr  Gill  sent for him to an Alehouse in  Wilney  Mr  Gill  went boldly as innocently to them and as they were Strangers and had pretended Business he wonder'd they discours'd with him of several Things treated him courteously paid the Reckoning but never spoke a a word of any Business to him only frequently whisper'd together and left him  The Truth of this after came out and Mr  Brookhouse  Jaylor of  Derby  discovered the whole Affair to Mr  Gill  how and on what Pretence the two Men were procur'd to be sent from  Derby  whose Business with him was  to have apprehended him  but the reason of their leaving him as they did was because they found  he was not that Man  By this Discovery Mr  Gill  came to know that Mr  James  's Assistant in this new Plot was one  Thomas Johnson  an Attorney of  Outwell  a Man of ill Fame and foul Practice who positively affirm'd to the two Men that came from  Derby  that Mr  Gill  was the same Man that broke out of  Derby  Jayl  This Delusion might in some measure have pleaded in Excuse of Mr  James  if his next Scene had not put him out of the reach of any rational Shelter or Defence for not content with this Defeat he joyn'd with this infamous Attorney and one  Tho Beart  who since died in a most horrible manner rotting away above ground These three went to one  John Marriot  of  Upwell  and offer'd to give him Pounds or to Guineas if he would swear that Mr  Gill  was the same Man that had broke out of  Derby  Jayl for Forgery and Counterfeiting  But here they were defeated again and Heaven the only Protector of Innocence so blinded their Understanding that they always made an ill Choice of their Instruments Honest  John Marriot  told them plainly he knew Mr  Gill  was not the same Man and ask'd them with what face they could desire him to burthen his Conscience with a false Oath or fell his Soul for Guinea's  By this time the Reader is to suppose Mr  Gill  arriv'd at  Cambridge  where having been above Days and all that while walking publickly about the Streets and openly enquiring about the Notice in the  Gazette  he receiv'd a Message from the ViceChancellour of  Cambridge  to come to him to  Jesus College  whither confirm'd and assur'd of his own Innocence he freely went  Coming to the College Dr  Cook  demanded his Name which Mr  Gill  readily told him and the Place of his last Residence and Preaching  viz  at  Wilney  Dr  Cook  told him that he was describ'd in the  Gazette  and upon the Advertisement therein he must send him to Jayl which he accordingly did on the th of  March  to the  Tolhooth  in  Cambridge  by a  Mittimus  in the following Words or to that effect  To the Keeper of the  Tolbooth Goal  at  Cambridge  these  I Send you herewith the Body of  Abraham Gill  whom I charge you to keep till discharg'd by due Course of Law  Sign'd  Will Cook  Thus without any Proof that he was the Man mention'd in the  Gazette  without any Oath or any Crime alledg'd Mr  Gill  was Committed to Prison by the worthy Dr  Cook  of which 'tis presum'd he may hear again in a different manner than this  Nor was the sending him to Prison the End of their Malice but as soon as he came thither he had heavy Irons laid upon him and was fetter'd like a Fellon or a Highwayman  At the General QuarterSessions Mr  Gill  being call'd and Dr  Cook  sitting on the Bench the Dr told him Mr  Gill  they had nothing to charge him with He told them Then they had done him a great deal of Wrong to keep him in Custody so long and treat him so hardly and loading him with Irons And as they had now nothing against him he hoped they never would and therefore pray'd they would Discharge him  Notwithstanding all this they remanded him to Prison Dr  Cook  alledg'd he had a Letter from Mr  James  Rector of  Upwell  full of Crimes against Mr  Gill  in which Letter it seems he desir'd Mr  Gill  might be kept close Prisoner till the next Quarter Sessions  In Obedience to this Command of Mr  James  Dr  Cook  endeavour'd to keep Mr  Gill  in Prison but the Barbarity of this Treatment appearing so exceeding great and the Action so foul that the Country began to talk of it some Gentlemen of the Country having spoken of it to Dr  Cook  's Disadvantage which coming to his Ears he was at last prevail'd upon to accept of Bail for Mr  Gill  two eminent Freeholders of that Conuty of  l per ann  each offering to be his Bail  The Bail being such as could not be objected against  The Dr let him go  binding his Bail in  l  each and himself in  l  to appear at the QuarterSessions  This Usage of Mr  Gill  with the Fury and Barbarity of their Curate and Rector had so wrought upon the Inhabitants of  Upwell  together with the known Innocence of their Minister that it fill'd them with just Prejudices and they unanimously invited Mr  Gill  to come and Preach to them as a Congregation Dissenting from the  Church which he did duly Licencing the Place in the Archdeacon's Court at  Norwich  and duly Qualifying himself according to Law  From whence the Author of these Sheets humbly observes and recommends it to the Consideration of the Clergy of the Church of  England  Whether such unjust and cruel Treatment of their FellowChristians Neighbours and Brethren is the Way to confirm the People in their Adherence to the Church of  England  or whether they do not rather Wound the Church drive their Parishioners from her fill them with Prejudices and encrease the Number of the Dissenters in this Nation  Mr  Gill  being thus settled among his old People and knowing that he was to appear at the Quarter Sessions where he had good reason to expect all the foul Usage his Enemies wer capable of and where he saw their Power was but too great was advised to remove it by  Certiorari  to the  Queensbench  which he did accordingly the  Certiorari  being allow'd in Court and the Fees of it paid by Mr  Gill  But Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  the Curate hearing of this  Certiorari  they or one of them went to  Cambridge  at the Assize and applying themselves to my Lord Chief Justice  Holt  by the means of Dr  Cook  and Dr  James  they procur'd a  Habeas Corpus  to remove Mr  Gill  to  Norwich  Jayl pretending they could prove Matter of Fact against him there  Accordingly he was Committed to  Norwich  Jayl for Felony Forgery Trespass Contempt and other high Crimes and Misdemeanours  Here the said Mr  Gill  lay till the Assizes and still his Enemies being able to bring nothing against him he mov'd by his Conncil to be Discharg'd and was Discharg'd accordingly by Order of the Court which Order is there to be seen upon Record  Here he was credibly inform'd Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  striving by some other Machinations and Conspiracies to have continued Mr  Gill  in Jayl to the next Assizes receiv'd a severe Reprimand from the Lord Bishop of  Norwich  for their unjust and inhumane Treatment of Mr  Gill  and that his Lordship threatned them with Suspension upon that account  Also that Mr  Clark  the Register of the Spiritual Court at  Norwich  being enquir'd of concerning his Name being put into the Advertisement in the  Gazette  as that he would give a Reward for the Apprehending Mr  Gill  declared it was done without his  Privity or Consent and that it was a meer genuine Forgery that he knew nothing of it but that it was as strange and surprizing to find his Name there as it could be to Mr  Gill  to see his there  Thus being return'd to his People Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  whom henceforward in Charity to them I shall conceal under the Title of the Conspirators theratned him that if he presumed yet to Preach there he should be sent to Prison again But he continuing to do his Duty it remains to examine how punctual they were to their Words with him  About the th of  April  one  Thomas Pitchford  Constable of  Wilney  serv'd a Warrant on Mr  Gill  under the Hand of  Tho Edwards  Esq  a Justice of the Peace for the  Isle of Ely  the Warrant requiring the said Constable to bring Mr  Gill  before him  c  the th of the same Month at  Wisbich  The Constable having serv'd his Warrant took Mr  Gill  's Word for his Appearing but Mr  Lateward  one of the Conspirators came in a great Passion and railing at the Constable told him he must keep Mr  Gill  close Prisoner till his Appearnce for that then he should certainly go to Jayl and if he went away from him he  the Constable  should go to Jayl in his room and more ill Language to the like effect however the Constable still took Mr  Gill  's Word for his Appearance  On the th of  April  being a Sessions the said Mr  Gill  appear'd according to his Promise at  Wisbich  where was present or Justices several Gentlemen some Clergy men and the Conspirators  Mr  L  one of  the Conspirators  call'd the Constable to bring up  Gill  his Prisoner upon which Mr  Gill  readily appear'd The  Conspirators  immediately told their Tale and giving Mr  Gill  base and scurrilous Language according to their particular Talent which abounds that way they inform'd the Justices that Mr  Gill  bred great Disturbances in the Parish by a Conventicle as Conventicles did all  England  over  Which by the way might be the only Truth they spoke  for it seems by these very Words he bred no more Disturbance with his Conventicle than other Ministers did with theirs  ergo  they should be all serv'd so  Shortest Way for that  Mr  Edwards  one of the Justices taking up the Cause told Mr  Gill  he was inform'd he kept an unlawful Assembly or Conventicle at  Upwell  and gave him a great deal of rough and threatning Language  Mr  Gill  with Calmness and Respect replied He own'd he kept a Meeting for Religious Worship at  Upwell  in the County of  Norfolk  but that it was no unlawful Assembly for the Place was Licensed according to Law and he had qualified himself as the Law Directs and therefore hoped he did not deserve to receive such Abuse in that place  The Justice then Demanded to see the Licence by which the said Mr  Gill  held the Meeting which he producing both the  Conspirators  said in open Court it was Forged and whether the Court believed them or no is uncertain or what other reason they had for it will be enquir'd in another place but they immediately made a  Mittimus  and Committed Mr  Gill  to the Jayl in  Wisbich  for Forging a Licence and Preaching in a Conventicle And taking the Licence from him they refus'd to restore it him  They demanded indeed Bail but gave him no leave to find it refusing to let him stir out of the place But Mr  Gill  may without Detriment to his Cause allow all their Pretensions of Bail for his Behaviour since the Treatment he had received from them was such as he might be sure whoever he had brought to be his Bail should be brought into equal Trouble and for that Reason he resolv'd to embroil none of his Friends  And being sensible of no Crime for which he ought by the Law to be bound to his Behaviour he was advis'd not to offer any Bail and refer it to the Law still to decide whetherit could be justly demanded  The Wisdom as well as Justice of these Magistrates is very remarkable also here that they should know no better than to Commit a Man in the  Isle of Ely  for a Fact pretended to be committed in the County of  Norfolk  all which will help to their Consolation when they shall come to answer for it before a Court and Judges that understand the Law  And as I undertook at first to prove every thing as I went along the following Affidavit is an undoubted Testimony of the Truth of this last part of the Tragedy  viz  of the  Conspirators  charging him with Forgery which they could not pretend to prove and their treating him with base scurrilous Language tho' all of them are pleas'd to deny it upon Oath  Mr  Cole  's Affidavit  JOseph Cole  of  Upwell  in the County of  Norfolk  Gent maketh Oath That  Abraham Gill  of  Welney  in the  Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  is a Preacher to a Congregation of her Majesty's Protestant Dissenting Subjects in  Upwell  aforesaid having been a Preacher in the said Parish of  Welney  for several Years last past and that he is now and hath all the time been well approved of his Congregation And this Deponent farther saith That on or about the th day of  April  last past he saw the said Mr  Gill  brought before Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace at  Wisbich  in the said Isle of  Ely  by vertue of a Warrant to answer the Complaint of Mr  Hugh James  Rector of  Upwell  aforesaid and that at that time there was one Mr  Lateward  Curate to the said Mr  James  and Mr  James  in presence and that the said Mr  Lateward  commanded the Constable who then had the said Mr  Gill  in Custody to bring up  Gill  his Prisoner which the Constable did when and where Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  alledged That the said Mr  Gill  kept an unlawful Conventicle And Mr  Gill  to justifie the keeping of a lawful Meeting for Worship of  God  produced his Licence whereupon the said Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  affirmed That the said Mr  Gill  had forged the Licence and they gave the said Mr  Gill  very base unbecoming and scurrilous Language which Mr  Gill  to my Knowledge did not deserve nor did it become them to utter and afterwards upon this way of Complaint Mr  Gill  was committed to the Jayt in  Wisbich  aforesaid And this Deponent verily believes That the said Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  have maliciously designed to ruin and undo the said Mr  Gill  and his Family consisting of a Wife and four small Children for they have by several barbarous ways of Prosecution utterly reduced the said Mr  Gill  and his Family to Poverty And this Deponent verily believes that the said Mr  Gill  never gave either Mr  James  or Mr  Lateward  any cause of Offence nor did they or ever could they prove any cause of their malicious Prosecution But this Deponent verily believes that the cause of this Malice of Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  against Mr  Gill  was because Mr  Gill  Preached twice every Lord'sday and they but once and Mr  Gill  was more diligent in his Ministry and more charitable to the Poor and better approved of in his Place than they the said Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  are And this Deponent farther saith That Mr  Gill  hath been a Freeholder in the said Parish for several Years till  about the th of  September  and that  James Holms  of  Welney  since deceased held in Farm under Mr  Gill  for several Years a parcel of Land of Mr  Gill  's Freehold of the yearly Rent of  l    s  or thereabouts and that Mr  Gill  had other Lands besides and lived in good Fame and Plenty amongst his Neighbours and he the said Mr  Gill  is greatly beloved in the whole Parish by all but a few that dare not displease the said Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  Joseph Cole  In this Condition Mr  Gill  remain'd a close Prisoner without Bail till the General QuarterSessions which was about five Days when he expected to be call'd and lawfully charg'd with some matter of Misdemeanour or else to be discharg'd  But now the Plot was ripe for Execution and at the QuarterSessions he was omitted and never call'd at all  The Assizes follow'd in two Days more  viz April  when he design'd to move for his Discharge not doubting but he should find Justice there as he had before at  Norwich  But the Design was calculated  to disappoint him here too  and now the black Scene opened for on the said th of  April  being the first Day of the Assizes the  Conspirators  had procur'd two Justices in Concert with themselves to come to  Wisbich    tho' above    Miles out of their own Division  The Names of these worthy Gentlemen are  for they deserve to be recorded    David Rowland  Esq  and  Francis Fern  Esq  and Clerk for this Gentleman is both Clergyman and Magistrate of whom we shall say no more till Justice thinks fit to take Cognisance of them and treat them as they deserve  These Gentlemen who now made up the number of the  Conspirators  to be four brought with them one Captain  Marshal  an Officer in Colonel  Lutteril  's Regiment of  Marines  in order to Impress List and Carry away this innocent Man as a Souldier by Virtue of the Law for Listing Vagabonds  There were several Officers in the Town who wou'd have been very willing to have rais'd Men and who stay'd there for that purpose but the Country had rung too loud of the Injury done this poor Man so that no Officer that knew the Circumstance could be imagin'd  Villain enough  to confederate but this Gentleman having the Word of a Justice of Peace and  a Man of God made a Magistrate  might the more easily be imposed upon  Upon the Arrival of these Gentlemen Mr  Gill  was sent for out of Prison to the Sign of the  Bell  in  Wisbich  All the  Conspirators  being present the Church Justice began with him in base and villainous Language as unbecoming his Commission as his Gown calling him  Disturber of the Country  and  Sawcy Fellow  for answering for himself told him he was  a Drunkard    a Swearer  and a great deal to the same purpose that he rais'd a Conventicle in Mr  James  's Parish Impair'd the Congregation at the Church which was a thing of bad Consequence and  ought to be supprest  and that he was not fit to live in the Country but to Serve Her Majesty and that therefore he should go for a Souldier  This Justice  Fern  being justly asham'd of this Treatment is pleas'd upon his Oath to deny giving any ill Language and therefore to make out that Particular as we go take the following Affidavit of an honest Inhabitant of  Upwell  who heard it  Cornelius Neale  's Affidavit  COrnelius Neale  of  Upwell  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  Carpenter maketh Oath That he at the time of  Abraham Gill  's being Imprest for a Soldier to wit on or about the th day of  April    A D  did see the said  Abraham Gill  in Custody in a Room at the Sign of the  Bell  at  Wisbich  where was  John Bellamy  Esq  and  Francis Ferne  Clerk Justice of Peace for the said Isle and another Gentleman who as this Deponent was informed was  David Rowland  Esq  another Justice of Peace for the said Isle who after some base scurrilous and hasty Words by them given to the said  Abraham Gill  then right or wrong ordered that he should go into Her Majesty's Service for a Souldier and then caused the Officer to tender him Listingmoney after which they ordered the said Officer to read the Articles of War to him and this Deponent did see the said  Abraham Gill  some time after with the rest of the Imprest Men  Cornelius Neale  There was present another Justice of the Peace one  John Bellamy  Esq  who at first vigorously oppos'd these Gentlemen told them he found Mr  Gill  had a Licence and he verily believ'd it was a good one that if he Mr  Gill  was guilty of any Crimes he ought to be Tryed for them and that now was a good time to do  it in the Judges being in Town and the Assizes begun and advis'd them to consider if their Authority extended to Pressing him for a Souldier  This wholsome Advice  which they may have leisure to repent they did not accept of  they overrul'd They flew into some Heat at Mr  Bellamy  's arguing for him and told him tho' they were not in their own Division yet they were Justices there as well as he and expected that they had a Power to act all over the Isle and if they had any Power they would try it for  the said  Gill  should be Imprest  and sent for a Souldier and they would answer itAt which Mr  Bellamy  was overruled and joyn'd with them  Mr  Gill  told them That besides his Profession which he suppos'd exempted him from such an Insult as that he had two Qualifications expresly excepted in the Act and which legally forbid them what they now purpos'd to doFirst That he was  a Freeholder of England  and Secondly That he was  a Freeman of a Corporation  both which were expresly nam'd in the Act of Parliament as Qualifications excepted  Justice  Bellamy  urg'd again That these were material Objections and ask'd him Where he was a Freeholder and for How much He told them he was a Freeholder to the Value of  l per Ann  Land of Inheritance in the County of  Lancaster  where he was born and a Freeman of the Corporation of  Wigan  Mr  Bellamy  urg'd again that he should be remanded to Prison till they could send to the Place to be inform'd But the Plot was otherwise laid and they resolv'd he should go so they call'd Captain  Marshal  and order'd him to give him S which Mr  Gill  refus'd then they order'd his Name to be entred in a Certificate for Imprest Men and the Justices Sign'd it and Delivered him over to the Capt and Mr  Fern  in particular call'd to the Souldiers and bid them tear his Band off and take him along with them and use him  Severely    in so many Words  Which Command the Souldiers took care to execute for they carried him into a large Room crowded with Prest Men where he had nothing but Straw to lie on And in this Posture and Place he remain'd sitting up in his Cloaths and Boots for six or seven days and then was oblig'd to march on foot in his Boots RidingCoat  C  to  Downham  Miles and from thence to  Ely  and thence to  Cambridge  or  For the Proof of this Matter and how cunningly and industriously these Men acted some to get out of the Room and avoid signing the Certificate of his Impressing and others to sink and  conceal the Certificate it self in order to smother an Action they were justly asham'd of the following Affidavits are necessary to be examin'd  CApt  Henry Marshal  of Col  Alexander Lutterel  's Regiment of Marines maketh Oath That in pursuance of a late Act of Parliament  John Browne    Thomas Gibson  and  Abraham Gill  on the twenty sixth day of  April  last past were brought before Mr  Rowland  Mr  Pearson  Mr  Bellamy  and Mr  Fern  four of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the Isle of  Ely  in the County of  Cambridge  who thought them the said  Browne    Gibson  and  Gill  to be proper Persons to serve as Soldiers under Her Majesty Queen  Ann  Thereupon as the said Act directs a Tender was made by this Deponent to them the said  Browne    Gibson  and  Gill  of twenty Shillings each in the Presence of the aforesaid Justices which the former accepted and the last refused And this Deponent farther saith That the Certificate for the said three Soldiers was lodged in the Hands of one of the Clerks belonging to one of the aforesaid Justices in order to be registred but is since lost or mislaid And the said Clerk in whose Hands it was so lodged alledgeth That he left it with the said Mr  Bellamy  who owned to this Deponent that he had a Copy of the said Certificate but deny'd that he had the Original  H Marshal  This Affidavit charging some of the Clerks the Certificate we shall trace it thither and first Justice  Bellamy  owns he had a Copy but denies that he had the Original  In the next place the Clerk to Justice  Colvill  swears That in his Presence all the Justices agreed Mr  Gill  should be listed and that he should be delivered to Capt  Marshal  and ordered him to draw up the Certificate which he did but did not see it sign'd the Copy of which is as below  JOHN Rawlett  of  Thorney  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  Clerk to  Ralph Peirson    Esq  one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said Isle maketh Oath That at a Meeting of several Justices of the Peace for the said Isle and in particular of this Deponent's Master  Josiah Colvill    David Rowland  Esquires  Francis Fern  Clerk and  John Bellamy  Esquires on or about the seven and twentieth Day of  April  last it was agreed by the said Justices That  Abraham Gill  of  Welneth  in the said Isle of  Ely  who was then examined before the said Justices should be lifted for a Soldier as being a Person according to their Opinion liable thereto according to the late Act of Parliament for raising Recruits for the Land Forces and Marines and that the said  Gill  should be delivered accordingly to Capt  Henry Marshal  of the Honourable Col  Lutterel  's Regiment of Marines who was then present and tend'red the said  Abraham Gill  twenty Shillings for Listing Money in this Deponent's Presence And this Deponent saith That the said Justices ordered this Deponent to draw up a Certificate of the same according to the Directions of the said Act of Parliament The Articles of War against Mutiny and Desertion being also then read by the said Capt  Marshal  to the said  Abraham Gill  And this Deponent did accordingly draw up a Certificate as also of the listing of  Thomas Gibson  and  John Browne  both of  Well  in the same Isle which at the Desire of the said Capt  Marshal  was not sealed that Night because he expected more Soldiers and designed to put them all into one and the same Certificate the Day following And this Deponent saith that the Paper hereunto annexed is the Draught of the said Certificate but this Deponent going away in the Morning following is not acquainted with what was farther done on the Premises only that he left a Copy of the said Certificate behind him with the said Mr  Bellamy  John Rawlet  IN Pursuance of an Act of Parliament made in the Second and Third Year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lady  Anne  by the Grace of God of  England    Scotland    France  and  Ireland  Queen Defender of the Faith  c  for raising Recruits of the Land Forces Marines  c  We whose Hands and Seals are hereto set three of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said  Isle  do hereby certify That the following Persons we listed according to the said Act by Captain  Henry Marshal  in the Honourable Colonel  Lutterel  's Regiment of Marines who did make Tender of twenty Shillings to the Persons hereafter mentioned which they accepted  of and that the said  Captain  did read the Articles of War against Mutiny and Dissertion to them in our Presence  Tho Gibson  of  Well  in the said  Isle  John Brown  de eadem  Abraham Gill  late de eadem  These three Men above written were listed before us  To return to Mr  Gill  The Fateagne of this violent March reduc'd him to a very miserable Condition his Feet and Legs gall'd and swell'd with his Boots and his Blood as may be supposed surfeited and heated with unusual Force beyond his Strength  Thus you have the History of his Delivery over to the Soldiers with whom and in the Condition as above he came to  Cambridge  where he was arrested for Debt and so by one Misfortune delivered from another  They used some Attempts to clear him from this Arrest but the Debt appearing to be real and too much for them to discharge being  l    s    d  they were forc'd to leave him in the  Tollbooth  Prison at  Cambridge  The Conspirators who concluded their Work was done and Mr  Gill  carried clear off were under no small Disappointment when they heard he was gotten out of their Hands and tho' they could not but know where he was yet in pursuit of their old Design they issued Hue and Cry to apprehend him as a Deserter from the Queen's Service and Mr  Fern  the  ChurchJustice  sign'd the Hue and Cry This failing they issued a special private Warrant to Constables at  Upwell    Wilney  and  Maney  to make search for him and still  the reverend Mr  Fern'  s Hand was to this also  as by the Warrant now secured and remaining with the Constables of  Wilney  will appear  It was now high time for Mr  Gill  to take Sanctuary in the Law and going to Counsel in the Case he was advised to move in the  Queen's Bench  for a  Habeas Corpus  to discharge him from enrolling or listing in the Army which he did and obtain'd it accordingly and also a Rule of Court for all the  Conspirators  to show Cause  c  And now these Gentlemen having run their Length the Tables were turn'd and the Time began to come when they must render an Acount to her Majesty and the Law for all this Oppression of her Subjects Contempt of her Authority and Abuse of the Power put into their Hands by the Laws  The  Conspirators  appear'd at the  Queen's Bench  Court in  Westminster  and mov'd for Time and several Motions being made alternately in order to bring in Affidavits at last they found themselves so press'd by the Course of the Law that they were obliged to have Recourse to their old stock of Villany they had work'd upon before and form'd a second Conspiracy to bring Mr  Gill  into Contempt of the Court the detecting whereof will conclude this part of our History and the future Rewards Justice will bestow upon them for these things are reserv'd to their proper Season and may serve for a Second Part of this Account  After seven Weeks Imprisonment at  Cambridge  Mr  Gill  having made up matters with his Creditor was releas'd and went home to his Family at  Welney  showing himself publickly and Preaching every Week to his Congregation as usual for now the  Conspirators  saw he was out of their power and whatever they did they must expect to account for  At last they mov'd the Court that Mr  Gill  might appear in Person to accuse them which was granted and appointed to be on the th of  July  last  Mr  Gill  's Attorney sent him Notice of this Order and he immediately went for  London  and setting out on the d of  July  in order to his appearing in the Court with one Mr  Tokelove  in his Company he was arrested on the Road about Miles from his own House by one  Betts  a Bailiff in an Island Warrant at the Suit of one  John Smith  of  Downham  Betts  the Bailiff holding him to Bail carry'd Mr  Gill  to  Maypole  a little Village Miles from his own House Mr  Gill  being exceedingly surpriz'd at this Arrest knowing the Consequence of his Disappointment perswaded the Bayliff to go back with him Miles to  Maney  where he got some Friends to be his Bail  This ended the Trifle of the Arrest but the  Conspirators  End was answered by it for by that time Bail was given it was Afternoon and there was no possibility of Mr  Gill  's being in Court at the time appointed which was the next Morning being not able to ride all night nor to ride so hard as to reach to  London  time enough sending Mr  Tokelove  who was then with him forward to  Cambridge  to make Oath of what had pass'd which he did accordingly as will appear by his Affidavit being above Miles  so he went back to his own House  The Court resented his Default and the  Conspirators  took Care to have it improv'd to his Disadvantage But before we come to relate the Consequences of the Contempt in Court 'tis proper to  examine the Contrivances of this Arrest and some subsequent Management of the  Conspirators  When  Betts  the Bayliff first arrested Mr  Gill  he told him That this was a Choak Pare for him and was procur'd by Mr  Lateward    one of the Conspirators  to prevent his appearing at  London  This was spoken in the hearing of Mr  Tokelove  who was then with Mr  Gill  as appears by the following Affidavit  RIchard Tokelove  of  Upwell  in the County of  Norfolk  Yeoman maketh Oath That he this Deponent came to Mr  Abraham Gill  's House at  Wellney  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  on the third Day of  July    Ann Dom  One Thousand Seven Hundred and Four very early that Morning and found him at home and that the said Mr  Gill  nor this Deponent did not that Day Morning see nor speak with  John Betts  the Bayliff till he overtook and arrested the said Mr  Gill  on the  Bank Road  six Miles from home or thereabonts he this Deponent and the said Mr  Gill  being going for  London  And this Deponent doth farther say That the said  John Betts  did then declare That the said Mr  Gill  was arrested by the Procurement of one Mr  Lateward  intending for to stay his Journey from attending the Court  Richard Tokelove  Betts  the Officer a Man capable of being moulded for the purpose of the  Conspirators  not remembring what he had said at the time of the Arrest chang'd his Note quickly after  For the  Conspirators  finding the Plot had taken Effect and that they had effectually prevented Mr  Gill  from appearing at the Court the next Step was to make the World believe this was a Contrivance of his own and so throw their own Villany upon Mr  Gill  Accordingly they report That Mr  Gill  had caused himself to be arrested in order to get an excuse for his not going to  London  not daring to appear at the  Queen's Bench Bar  And now that their Engine may appear as black as themselves this Mr  Betts  the Bayliff is made to swear  That he  Betts  had a Letter from Mr  Smith  the Plaintiff at  Downham  to him with Orders to arrest Mr  Gill  and that this Letter was of Mr  Gill  's own writing but sign'd by Mr  Smith  He swears That he received two several Letters from Mr  Gill  directed to himself desiring him to arrest him that  Monday  Morning that he was to go to  London  in order to stop his Journey  He swears Mr  Gill  call'd him up that Morning in order to be arrested by him and that he brought him a blank Warrant  c  Tho' this  ComiTragedy  will be best related after this Wretch has been brought to Justice with his Procurers the  Conspirators  yet to finish this Relation 'tis necessary to acquaint the World how this  hardmouth'd Swearer  is confronted  Mr  Tokelove  swears as before That he  Betts  voluntarily declared at the time of the Arrest That it was  procur'd by Mr Lateward  but this 'tis supposed was before he was made privy to the Conspiracy and being afterward let into the Secret forgetting what he had said confirm'd the World in his own known Character and verify'd the Truth of that old Saying  Opportet Mendacem esse Memoriam  Mr  Smith  of  Downham  the Plaintiff owns He gave leave to Mr  Lateward  to order Mr  Gill  to be arrested but swears He was desir'd so to do by an importunate Letter from Mr  Lateward  as  per  his Affidavit appears and being threatn'd in Case of Refusal  JOHN Smith  of  Downham  in the County of  Norfolk  Yeoman maketh Oath That he this Deponent received a Letter by a Messenger from Mr  Lateward  Curateat  Welney  to the best of this Deponent's Remembrance the Letter bares Date about the latter end of  June  last The Purport and Meaning of the Letter was to desire and indeed strongly to urge him this Deponent to give the said Mr  Lateward  Orders to arrest Mr  Abraham Gill  Minister to a Dissenting Congregation at  Upwell  and the Letter urged That Mr  Gill  must be arrested  Monday  Morning next after the Date thereof by one or two a Clock in the Morning to prevent Mr  Gill  's attending at  London  at a Hearing between Mr  Hugh James  Rector of  Upwell  and Mr  Gill  and then Mr  James  could have an Advantage against Mr  Gill  The Letter promised That his this Deponent's Kindness should be well gratify'd if this Deponent answered the Request else Mr  Lateward  and his Interest would take it unkindly and this Deponent should loose their Respect upon which this Deponent gave order in writing by Mr  Lateward  's Messenger to arrest Mr  Gill  and use their Pleasure according to Law and this Deponent is well satisfied they did order Mr  Gill  to be arrested and kept in Custody about ten Miles from  home in his Journey towards  London  And this Deponent is credibly informed That the Bayliff one  Betts  hath been often feasted and well fed by Mr  Lateward  and hath constantly kept Mr  Lateward  Company and rode about with him ever since And this Deponent farther saith That he saw Mr  Gill  upon the six and twentieth of this instant  October  who is very sick and hath been so for a long time and is very weak unfit for going abroad and liker for Death than Life  John Smith  Mr  Tokelove  swears He was with Mr  Gill  early in the Morning the same Day he was arrested and found him at Home and never parted with him till he was arrested and that therefore it was impossible he should call at  Bett's  House as  Betts  swears he did to have him arrest him And because Mr  Tokelove  's Affidavit is very full and a Confirmation of several things already advanced here we refer to the Copy of it duly attested as follows  RIchard Tokelove  of  Upwell  in the County of  Norfolk  Yeoman maketh Oath That Mr  Abraham Gill  of  Welney  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  did never serve at  Welney  Chappel as Curate to Dr  Gragge  or to any one else to his this Deponent's Knowledge but was a Preacher elected and chose by the Congregation and Feoffees in a time when the Chappel was vacant and this Deponent's Opinion is That it was in the said Feoffees and Congregation's Power to elect their Minister And this Deponent farther saith That the said Mr  Gill  was a Freeholder for several Years in  Welney  and lived in good Fame and Plenty all the time of two pious and sober Rectors of the said Parish and was well approved of both for Doctrine Charity and Behaviour And this Deponent farther saith That since Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  have been so malicious against Mr  Gill  he is elected and chosen a Preacher to a Dissenting Congregation of Protestants in  Upwell  aforesaid and is able in Doctrine religious and of sober Life and Conversation and highly approved of with his Congregation and most of his Neighbours and with most his Acquaintance but Mr  James  our present Rector at  Upwell  and Mr  Lateward  his Curate as this Deponent very believes envying the said Mr  Gill  and maliciously designing to ruin him and his Family  hath scandalously maliciously and without Cause spread abroad evil unjust and undeserving Characters of the said Mr  Gill  which by Strangers and Persons remote and Illwishers to the Dissenting Party may perhaps be believed as coming from such Authors and this Deponent farther saith That it is his Opinion that by insinuating Speeches and Threatnings the said Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  have caused the Clerk one  Thomas Fewlis  who is a loose idle and wicked Person to swear contrary to his Knowledge and to the Truth and that only for fear of losing his Clerk's Place and their Favour and this Deponent the rather believes this because he hath heard the said  Fewlis  commend the said Mr  Gill  and set forth a quite contraryCharacter of him And this Deponent farther saith That the said Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  have given Mr  Gill  very unjust Prosecution which hath reduc'd him to Poverty Mr  Gill  having been imprisoned at their Complaint in several Goals  viz  at  Cambridge  in  March  and  Aprill    May    June  and  July  and removed to  Norwich  Goal and kept Prisoner all the Assize Week till discharged the last Day according to Law and believes that he was entered in the Goaler's Calender  July  And after their Threatning to imprison him again if he presumed to serve and preach to our Congregation any more they have this last  April  persecuted and imprisoned the said Mr  Gill  and without shewing Cause of the Imprisonment or giving any Prosecution at Sessions or Assizes which was at the same time of his Imprisonment at  Wisbech  they caused him to be Imprest out of Goal for a Soldier without Liberty to make any Defence when at the same time he was our Minister and well approved of and highly beloved having as he may have still a very plentiful Allowance for his Maintenance that way of Preaching as this Deponent doth apprehend being a lawful Employment for a Maintenance and his Congregation is large consisting of Gentlemen and very substantial Freeholders as well as Farmers So that by the way of Prosecution not only Mr  Gill  but also this Deponent and all the said Congregntion are Sufferers and in truth Mr  James  did not only threaten and prosecute Mr  Gill  and procured him sent to Goal and imprest for a Soldier as aforesaid but positively sent to the Meetingplace though qualified according to Law and threatned some of the Congregation and especicially  him this Deponent and apprehended five several Men by a Warrant from Mr  Upwood  a Justice of the Peace and carried them like Felons before the said Mr  Upwood  which Persons although Mr  James  is pleased to swear they were idle Persons yet some were very substantial Freeholders and the rest substantial Farmers and very honest Men And altho' Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  pretend no Malice in their Prosecution yet it is a real Truth they have highly abused both Mr  Gill  and his Congregation and constantly preach railing Sermons as this Deponent hath heard and believes and they are reputed very malitious and troublesome Men in the Parish having excommunicated several Men and totally ruined one Mr  Whitworth  our SchoolMaster and in carrying on that malicious Design against him both Mr  James  and his Curate did swear falsly against him at  Swaffam  Sessions as one of the Grand Jury hath declared and affirmed and prosecuted the said Mr  Whitworth  till they banished him the Town causing him to be imprest for a Soldier as they did Mr  Gill  And this Deponent saith That it is credibly affirmed by one  John Marriot  that they would have had him to have sworn That our Minister Mr  Gill  was one Mr  Gill  a Minister who escaped out of  Darby  Goal about six Years since being convict for forging of Holy Orders and counterfeiting the King's Coin altho' Mr  Gill  had been in this Country about us nine or ten Years but the said  John Marriot  refused to go contrary to his Conscience And this Deponent farther saith That Mr  Gill  was never reported to be a Swearer or Drunkard as is alledged in their Affidavits and he verily believes he was never once seen to be drunk nor heard to swear one Oath since he came into our Country And this Deponent is very positive that neither Mr  James  nor any that made Affidavits at present against Mr  Gill  have any intimate Acquaintance or personal Knowledge of the said Mr  Gill  excepting  Nicholas Scott    Tho Beart  and  Tho Fewlis  which said  Thomas Fewlis  is overawed to swear to carry on and vindicate their unjust Prosecution as this Deponent believes and this Deponent verily believes he would for a Reward swear twice as much on Mr  Gill  's Behalf if requested And this Deponent farther saith That Mr  Gill  was coming the Morning towards  London  being the third Day of  July  about three a Clock in the Morning and was arrested upon the Road in an Action of Debt at the Suit of one  John  Smith  and is now in Custody and held to Bail and that the Bayliff says the Plaintiff was urged to arrest Mr  Gill  to prevent his attending the Court that so Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  might obtain an Advantage against him he is in Custody at  Maypole  ten Miles from home  Richard Tokelove  Mrs  Gill  Mr  Gill  's Wife swears That her Husband came home from the Meeting on the Evening before and did not stir out of his House till about two a Clock  Monday  Morning when Mr  Tokelove  and he took Horse together to go to  London  the same Day he was arrested  Elizabeth Gill  's Affidavit  ELizabeth Gill  the Wife of  Abraham Gill  of  Welney  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  maketh Oath That upon  Sunday  the second Day of  July    A D  last past this Deponent's Husband came home at Evening from his Congregation at  Upwell  and after his coming home was never out of his House all that Night till about one or two of the Clock the next Morning at which time  Richard Tokelove  of  Upwell  came to call him in order to go on a Journey with him towards  London  And this Deponent saith That her said Husband did not see nor speak with  John Betts  a Bayliff at that time nor with any other And that this Deponent's Husband and the said  Richard Tokelove  took Horse together and went on their Journey intending for  London  Elizabeth Gill  Mr  Gill  himself  who in this Case is Evidence for the Queen  swears That he neither wrote any Letters to  Betts  or call'd him up or ordered him to arrest him or procur'd any one else to order him or knew any thing directly or indirectly of this Arrest till he was surprized by him on the Road  Mr  Gill  's two Affidavits  ABraham Gill  of  Welney  in the Isle of  Ely  in the County of  Cambridge  maketh Oath That he this Deponent hath seen two Letters one dated the first and the other the second  day of  July  sign'd  Abra Gill  and also a Letter dated  July  the d signed  John Smith  as also a Writing purporting to be a Warrant for arresting this Defendant and which said Letters and Warrant when this Deponent saw the same were annexed to the Affidavit of one  John Betts  a Bayliff produced in this Honourable Court And this Deponent saith That the said Letters or Warrant or any or either of them or any part of any or either of them or the Name  Abra Gill  so signed to the two first of the said Letters is not nor are of this Deponent's own Handwriting nor were the said Letters or Warrant or either of them or any part of them or either of them writ by or with the Order Knowledge Privity or Procurement of this Deponent And this Deponent saith That he was not in Company with or did see or speak to or with the said  John Betts  upon the said second Day of  July  Nor did this Deponent call upon the said  John Betts  next Morning or see him till he overtook and arrested this Deponent as this Deponent was upon his Journey towards  London  to attend this Court And farther this Depenent saith That the said  Betts  upon such Arrest held this Deponent to Bail and this Deponent and one  Thomas Harrison  as this Deponent's Bail did seal and execute a Bail Bond accordingly in the Presence of the said  Betts  about one of the Clock that Day  Abra Gill  ABraham Gill  of  Welney  within the Isle of  Ely  in the County of  Cambridge  maketh Oath That he was no way directly nor indirectly privy to nor concerned in procuring  John Betts  to arrest him this Deponent neither did he this Deponent write any Letter or Letters to order it to be done as the said  Betts  in his Affidavit doth falsly depose but this Deponent was upon the Road coming to  London  in Obedience to a Rule made in this Honourable Court to appear in the said Court and was arrested by the said  John Betts  who then affirmed to this Deponent and one  Richard Tokelove  who then was with this Deponent that the said Arrest was by the Procurement of Mr  John Lateward  on purpose to prevent this Deponent's Journey or Words to the like Effect And this Deponent farther maketh Oath That he hath Freehold Lands in  Rivington  in  Lancashire  of the Yearly Value of eight or ten Pounds and hath had the same ever since the  time of this Deponent's Marriage being about fifteen or sixteen Years last past  Abra Gill  Now these four Persons must all be forsworn or else this Fellow has both perjur'd himself forg'd the Letters and Mr  Lateward  one of the  Conspirators  was the Procurer and Contriver of this Arrest and Mr  Gill  is very willing to wait the Conclusion the Law will give to this Affair when the World shall not fail of an impartial Account of the Particulars and Indictment of Perjury being ordered to be brought against the said  Betts  for this matter  To confront this indeed Mr  Lateward  swears to the following Affidavit full of  Negatives    Neithers  and  Don't knows  and all for himself too but that they may not complain of Partiality his Affidavit must not be omitted as follows  JOHN Lateward  of  Welney  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  Clerk aged twenty five Years and upward maketh Oath That he this Deponent never saw knew or had Acquaintance with any such Person as  John Smith  of  Downham  in  Norfolk  Yeoman nor did at any time ever write any Letter or send any Messenger to any such Person as the said  John Smith  concerning Mr  Abraham Gill  either about arresting him or any wise else however nor did this Deponent ever consent order or procure any Person so to do in his this Deponent's Name Neither did this Deponent ever hear of any such Person as the said  Smith  until after the said  Gill  was arrested or pretended to be arrested and at Liberty again Nor did this Deponent ever order the said  Gill  to be arrested nor knew that he was arrested nor knew  Betts  the Bayliff which arrested the said  Gill  till after such Arrest if any was made and the said  Gill  was again at Liberty Nor can this Deponent any wise imagine how any Letter should be wrote to the said  Smith  or any Messenger sent to him in this Deponent's Name about arresting the said  Gill  unless the same was done by the said  Gill  or by some other in his Behalf or by his Procurement which he this Deponent has good Reason to believe and suspect hath been done because as the said  Betts  the Bayliff who arrested the said  Gill  hath informed this Deponent and also this Deponent doth believe hath  deposed that the said  Gill  sent him a Note to arrest him the said  Gill  John Lateward  To corroborate this Affidavit and being we suppose asham'd of what he had done Mr  L d  took some pains to make Mr  Smith  of  Downham  to say back again what he had sworn for Proof of this Matter upon  Lateward  which Attempt appears by the Oaths of three credible Persons of  Downham  as follows  GEorge Holt  late of  Downham  Gent  William Pincher  of the same Town and County Taylor and  Mary Smith  the Wife of  John Smith  of the same Town and County do severally make Oath That one who called himself  Hugh James  Rector of  Upwell  in the County of  Norfolk  but as we are informed was Mr  Lateward  came to the said  John Smith  's House in  Downham  aforesaid upon the th day of  November  now last past and brought along with him one  Johnson  an Attorney of Her Majesty's Court of  Queen'sbench  a Man of Tricks and an unjust Practitioner who together did intreat  John Smith  the Husband of  Mary Smith  one of these Deponents to own and swear that the Affidavit he had made in the  Queen'sbench  this Term was unjust and untrue but he affirmed what he had done was just and that he would stand by it upon which they urged him to unsay it and then said it would prove his Ruin if the said  John Smith  did not revoke the former Affidavit  Geo Holt  William Pincher  Mary Smith  And against that part of Mr  Lateward  's Oath and  Betts  's Oath that it was wrote by Mr  Gill  besides the Affidavit of Mr  Gill  already mention'd we conclude this black Story with the following Affidavit  THomas Wilson  now of  Downham Market  in the County of  Norfolk  Gent maketh Oath That he being at the House of  John Smith  in  Downham  aforesaid saw and read a Letter there that was sent from Mr  John Lateward  to urge him to give Orders to Arrest Mr  Gill  and having seen  and well knowing the Handwriting of Mr  Gill  does verily believe and affirm that the said Letter was not Mr  Gill's  Handwriting  Tho Wilson  Only as the Conspirators have taken a great deal of pains to blacken Mr  Gill  and load him with Crimes of all which we shall fairly and honourably clear him we cannot but present the World with two Evidences to the Character of  this Knight of the Post  Mr  Betts  and 'tis humbly recommended to the Reverend Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  to clear their worthy Agent of the Charge lest the World should blame their Understanding for hugging such a Wretch and caressing a Man of whom they ought to have been ashiam'd to have been seen in his Company  Mr  Martin  Postmaster of  Epping    where this  Betts  it seems liv'd till he could stay there no longer  swears That he  Betts  having given Mr  Martin  Possession of some Goods for a just Debt he broke open the Door in the Night and carried them away and that being carried before a Justice he sav'd himself from being sent to Jayl by restoring the Goods again  THomas Martin  of  Epping  in the County of  Essex  Innholder maketh Oath That he this Deponent know  John Betts  late of  Epping  aforesaid Innkeeper but now of  Chatteris  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  as this Deponent is informed and believes and saith that the said  John Betts  being indebted to this Deponent this Deponent about six Years since caused him to be Arrested and thereupon the said  Betts  to procure his Liberty delivered certain Goods into Custody of anoter Person in trust for this Deponent But the said  Betts  caused the Door of the Room where such Goods were to be broke open in the night time and conveyed the same away and would not let this Deponent have the same again till this Deponent took him before a Justice of the Peace who forced the said  Betts  to redeliver the said Goods or else said he would send the said  Betts  to Jayl  Thomas Martin  Mr  Earl  of  Epping  swears  Betts  is a Person of a scandalous Character esteemed a Highwayman so that few of his Neighbours  care to be seen in his Company believing him a Man that cares not what he says or swears  RIchard Earl  of  Epping  in the County of  Essex  Yeoman aged sixty Years or thereabouts maketh Oath that he knoweth  John Betts  late of  Epping  aforesaid but now of  Chatteris  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  a Bailiff and saith that the said  Betts  is a Person of a very bad and scandalous Life and Reputation and is esteemed no better than a Highwayman insomuch that few of his Neighbours care to keep him Company and this Deponent verily believes he cares not what he either saith or swears And this Deponent farther saith That the said  Betts  when he lived at  Epping  caused a Room wherein he had put certain Goods in trust for one Mr  Martin  a Creditor of the said  Betts  to be broke open in the Nighttime and was taken before Justice  Wroth  on that account who forced the said  Betts  to deliver back the said Goods or said he would send him to Jayl or used Words to that or the like effect  Richard Earl  All these Affidavits were in behalf of Mr  Gill  produc'd in Court and Mr  Gill  being examin'd on several Interrogatories upon Oath and under Recognizance and having given the Court full Satisfaction was disharg'd of the Contempt and the rest of this black Story lies now before the Judges of Her Majesty's Court of  Queen'sbench  where Mr  Gill  doubts not to have Justice  The Conclusion  IT is enough  and the Matter of Fact as here truly related is Mr  Gill  's Satisfaction he covets no Victories and scorns to Insult them on the Conquest his Innocence and the Power of Truth made upon their procur'd Perjuries he recommends it to them to consider of what they have done and at least shew so much Penitence as becomes them to make their Appearance in their Cloth tolerable  It remains only to finish the Vindication of Mr  Gill  to reckon up a little the numerous Slanders and Reproaches which they have raised upon his Reputation and by undoubted Testimony  and positive Evidence confront their Calumnies and clear up his Character to the Satisfaction of his Friends who have been too much impos'd upon  and the Author asks their Pardon if he says have been something too apt to believe  and to the Conviction of his Enemies who have Triumph'd in a bad Cause and cry'd  Victoria  before they put their Armour off  In order to this 'tis necessary to set down in their own Language and the blackest Terms they could invent all the Calumnies and Abuses they have rais'd upon this poor Man in order to justifie their ill Practices and make their Designs tolerable to the World  And first The Publication in the  Gazette  speaks for it self and needs no Comment  And here 'tis very observable that it yet remains a Mystery who Convey'd this Advertisement to the Printer of the  Gazette  no body having yet thought fit to own it and the  at  Norwich  disowning it And this we presume must be referr'd to the Second Part of this History by which time Mr  Jones  no doubt in his own Vindication will produce his Voucher and the Courts of Justice so come at the Author  When the Justices Clergymen and the rest of the  Conspirators  came to be call'd upon to shew Cause of all this Usage after frequent Motions for Time they bring up numerous Affidavits partly in their own Justification and partly Defaming the Man  Of these Affidavits some of them being too long to insert in the Compass of this Book We have taken a faithful Abstract and to shew our Impartiality in this Account and that the World may see whether We have done them Justice or no the Affidavits are all left at the Place aforesaid for any Person that desires Satisfaction to peruse  "First  Thurgood Upton  Esq  and Justice of Peace swears That Mr  Hugh James  and  Thomas Beart    both frequently mentioned in this Book  made Complaint of Mr  Gill  That he was a Person of a scandalous and debauch'd Life a Frequenter of Alehouses and Houses of ill Fame and did for several Months cohabit with a certain Woman as his Wife whom he call'd  Elizabeth  and by whom he had two Children and that some time after the Birth of the first Child by the said  Elizabeth  another Woman follow'd the said  Gill  and pretended to be his Wife that he did for several Weeks cohabit with both the said Women and had also a Child by the second Woman who some  short time after dying he continued to cohabit with the first Woman as his WifeBut this Gentleman being a Justice for the County of  Norfolk  and the said  Gill  living in the Isle of  Ely  he refus'd to grant his Warrant having no Authority to act thereMr  Upton  also swears that there was a farther Complaint against Mr  Gill  by the said Mr  Hugh James  for keeping a Meeting in the Barn of one  Richard Tokelove  and several others that were present at the said Meeting who appearing and affirming that the said  Gill  had qualified himself and the Place was duly Licensed according to Law he dismist them Mr  Upon  adds his Belief that there is no Malice in Mr  James  's Prosecution giving him the Character of a sober Man and of good Reputation but Mr  Gill  of a notorious ill Life and Conversation and a Disgrace to Religion"  THurgood Upwood  of  Terrington  in the County of  Norfolk  Esq  one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said County maketh Oath That in or about the Month of  January  Complaint was made to this Deponent by  Hugh James  Clerk Rector of  Upwell  in the said County and also by  Thomas Beart  of the said Parish of  Upwell  That one  Abraham Gill  who had for some time past resided within the said Parish of  Upwell  and had officiated at  Welney  a Hamlet of the said Parish of  Upwell  as Curate to  Dr Grigg  since deceased and afterward to  Talbot Hibart  likewise deceased who were respectively Rectors of the said Parish That the said  Gill  was a Person of a very scandalous and debauched Life being a great Frequenter of Alehouses and other Houses of evil Fame and did also for several Months cohabit with a certain Woman as his Wife whom he called  Elizabeth  by whom he had two Children during his abode there and that some short time after the Birth of the first Child by the said  Elizabeth  another Woman followed the said  Gill  to the said Parish of  Upwell  who likewise pretended to be his Wife and that he did for several Weeks cohabit with both the said Women and had also a Child by the second Woman who some short time afterwards dying he did continue with the first Woman called  Elizabeth  who hath ever since cohabited with him as they informed this Deponent But it appearing to this Deponent that the said  Gill  was then an Inhabitant in that part of the said Parish that lies within the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  did refuse to grant a Warrant  against him he having no Authority to act there And this Deponent saith That there being farther Complaint made by the said  Hugh James  against the said  Gill  and several others in or about the Month of  March  last past for that the said  Gill  had kept a Meeting in the Barn of one  Richard Tooklove  at  Upwell  in the said County of  Norfolk  not having qualified himself or given notice of the said House according to Law This Deponent did grant a Warrant against the said  Tooklove  and several others that were present at the said Meeting whose Names this Deponent doth not remember And the said  Tooklove  and the rest of them affirming that the said  Gill  had a Licence to Teach in the said Barn and that the same was duly Licensed thereupon this Deponent forbore any farther Prosecution untill he should receive farther Information of the matter charged against them and farther deposeth That he doth not know or believe that there was any Malice in the Prosecution made by the said  Hugh James  against the said  Gill  the said  James  being a Person of sober Life and good Reputation and on the contrary That the said  Gill  is very notorious in his ill Life and bad Conversation and a great disgrace to the Christian Religion  Th Upwood  Mr  James  himself makes Oath at large  Hugh James  Rector of  Upwell  in the County of  Norfolk  Clerk maketh Oath That at the time of his Institution and Induction to the Rectory of  Upwell  he found  Abraham Gill  officiating as Curate in the Chapel of  Welney  according to the Rites of the Church of  England  And this Deponent being informed that the said  Abraham Gill  was a Person of notorious ill Life and Conversation this Deponent went to the Hamlet of  Welney  to reprove the said  Abraham Gill  for his scandalous Practices and to examine by what Authority and Licence he there officiated as Minister and Curate But the said  Abraham Gill  denying to shew this Deponent his Orders and Licence upon this and for several other reasons this Deponent made Complaint of the said  Gill  and his wicked Practices to the Lord Bishop of  Norwich  his Diocesan and deliver'd in to his Lordship an Information against  him made by  Thomas Beart  before  Thurgood Upton  Esq  one of His Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the County of  Norfolk  Upon which and several other Informations he was prosecuted in the Consistory Court of  Norwich  where he was detected of Forging Holy Orders under the Hand and Seal of the present Lord Bishop of  Chester  for which and several other enormous Crimes he had Excommunication read against him in  Welney  from which he is not yet absolved But some time after as this Deponent is credibly informed endeavour'd to impose upon one Mr  Cooper  Minister of  Bollingbrook  in  Lincolnshire  by forged Orders under the Hand and Seal of the present Lord Bishop of  Ely  desiring to be his Curate but being detected there of this Forgery the said  Gill  returned to  Welney  aforesaid whither his Family had been sent from  Bollingbrook  aforesaid by Order of the Justices of  Lincolnshire  And the said  Gill  still continuing in his scandalous Life set up a set up a separate Conventicle in the Parish of  Upwell  in the Barn of  Richard Tokelove  of the same Parish and did in that Barn on the Sabbathday preach to some Persons of no great Credit Upon which this Deponent thinking it his Duty to take notice of such Disorders and unlawful Practices especially by such an infamous Person procured a Warrant from the said Mr  Upton  to bring before him  Richard Tokelove  and four other idle Persons who absented themselves from the Church to follow and encourage this  Gill  that they might shew legal Authority for his Conventicle having no malicious Intent in the Prosecution And these Persons affirming that their Teacher  Abraham Gill  had the Licence for their Conventicle the said Mr  Upton  returned the Warrant by the Constable to bring them back if they did not produce or send the Licence to him and they not obeying this Order he granted another Warrant for the said  Gill  and  Tokelove  but  Abraham Gill  withdrawing himself into the Isle of  Ely  this Deponent made Complaint to  Tho Edwards  sen  Esq  one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the Isle of  Ely  in the County of  Cambridge  which said  Thomas Edwards  granted a Warrant to Apprehend the said  Gill  for his disorderly living and preaching in a Conventicle not being qualified for the same By vertue of which Warrant he was brought before several of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace in  Wisbich  who for several Reasons Committed him to Jayl And this Deponent  farther saith That he did not speak to the said  Abraham Gill  before he came into the Room where the said Justices were and that there he gave him no scurrilous Language but only spoke what was necessary to inform the Justices concerning his ill Life and illegal Practices And this Deponent farther saith That he did not move to have him sent to Goal nor did he affirm that his Licence was forged but only that there was great Suspicion of the same it being only a blank Certificate of a Licence without date and that it was not Mr  Brown  's Hand as other Gentlemen there likewise affirmed who knew Mr  Brown  's Hand And this Deponent farther maketh Oath That he believes that the Certificate under the Name of  John Arrowsmith  to be his proper Hand and that other Certificate under the Name of  Nich Brown  not to be his proper Hand having seen both their Hands upon other Occasions Neither Mr  Nich Brown  nor  John Jeffery  Clerk having any Jurisdiction in that part of  Norfolk  where  Richard Tokelove's  Barn stands  Hugh James  THomas Edwards  of  Wisbech  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  Esq  one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said Isle of  Ely  maketh Oath That upon the Complaint of Mr  Hugh James  Rector of  Upwell  against  Abraham Gill  of  Welney  for divers ill Crimes and Misdemeanours He this Deponent on or about the latter end of  March  last to the best of this Deponent's Remembrance granted a Warrant to bring the said  Abraham Gill  before this Deponent or some other of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said Isle to answer the said Complaint with Directions to bring  Sureties  for his Good Behaviour along with him and that on or about the th day of  April  following the said  Abraham Gill  was brought before this Deponent and  Josiah Colvile  Esq  and several other Justices of the Peace of the said Isle where were also present the said Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  his Curate and several others And the said Mr  James  amongst other Crimes accused the said  Gill  of living very lewdly and wickedly with a Woman whom he kept when his former Wife was living and had Children by the said Woman when his former Wife was living and that it was highly probable he was not then married to her as also of his setting up a Conventicle at  Welney  without any lawful  Authority that the said Mr  James  could find out or hear of with his being accustomed to Swearing and other Immoralities And the said  Abraham Gill  offering little or nothing in his own Defence as to his bad Life and Conversation and being a Person obscure and unknown from whence he came and of a very infamous Character and Reputation on divers accounts this Deponent with the other Justices then present required him the said  Abraham Gill  to give Sureties for his good Behaviour as the least thing they would demand of him which he not being able to do although most of his substantial Neighbours were present the said Mr  Colvile  and this Deponent Sealed his  Mittimus  and sent him to God till he should find Sureties accordingly And this Deponent farther saith That he did not hear of any scurrilous or ill Language which was given to the said  Abraham Gill  by any Person then present but saith That he the said  Abraham Gill  did then produce the Paper hereunto annexed purporting a Licence from the Archdeacon of the Archdeaconry of  Norwich  for holding Meetings in the House or Barn of one  Richard Tokelove  in  Upwell  aforesaid which being without Date and this Deponent and the other Justices present being well informed that  Upwell  was not within the Jurisdiction of the Archdeacon therein named and although it had been so yet that the said  Abraham Gill  was not duly qualified to preach or teach in the said Meetinghouse as being an Excommunicate Person as was then credibly affirmed nor could he make it appear in the least that he had qualified himself by Law to be a Teacher in such a Meeting at any Sessions of the Peace either in  Norfolk  or the Isle of  Ely  and several Persons then present affirming also that the Name  Nicho Browne  thereunto Subscribed was not the proper Handwriting of Mr  Nicholas Browne  this Deponent and the other Justices did not look upon the same to be authentick and had reason to suspect it to be forged and therefore detained it till farther Enquiry might be made concerning it  Tho Edwards  The following Oath is most remarkable because the Person has been frequently heard to acknowledge his Ignorance of what he swore and it being made upon publick Faith  THomas Fewlis  of the Hamlct of  Welney  Clerk to the Chapel of  Welney  aforesaid being in the Parish of  Upwell  in the  County of  Norfolk  maketh Oath That he officiated as Clerk of the said Chapel during some part of the time that  Abraham

said Chapel in this Deponent's presence And saith also that the said  Abraham Gill  for some part of the time he officiated in the said Cure did in a scandalous manner cohabit with two Women at one

Deponent upon the Lord'sday being the d day of  November  did read in the Chapel of  Welney  aforesaid an Excommunication against the said  Gill  wherein he was charged with several heinous Crimes as

Her Majesty's Commissioners to take Affidavits in the Court of  Queen'sbench  at  Westminster  amongst other matters and things in the same Affidavit mentioned charged this Deponent of speaking these Words following  viz  wishing his Body might rot in Goal and his Soul perish eternally This Deponent saith he did not speak the Words before recited nor any Words to the same effect nor ever made any Prosecution in his own Name or upon his own Account against the said  Gill  and had no other end or design than in the due Performance of his Duty to bring the said  Gill  to condign Punishment he having highly dishonoured God and the Christian Religion by his vicious Life and Conversation And this Deponent farther deposeth That for the space of one Year last past or thereabouts the said  Gill  and his Family have been and are still a Charge to the Inhabitants living within the said Hamlet of  Welney  they being frequently relieved by the Overseers of the Poor there  John Lateward  The following Affidavits are of the Justices who listed this Mr  Gill  tho' it appears both of them are glad to put in that they did not set their Hands to the Order or Certificate  DAvid Rowlands  of  Haddenham  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  Esq  one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said Isle maketh Oath That he this Deponent being at  Wisbech  in the said Isle at the last Assize one  Abraham Gill  and some other Persons were there brought before this Deponent and four other Justices of the Peace for the said Isle as Persons fit to be Listed to serve Her Majesty as Soldiers according to a late Act of Parliament for Raising Recruits for the Land Forces and  Marines  And this Deponent assisted the said Justices in the Examination of the said Persons and by all that was said on both sides this Deponent doth upon his Oath declare That he adjudged it agreeable to the said Act of Parliament that the said  Abraham Gill  should be Listed as a Soldier which also was the Opinion of the other Justices then present And farther this Deponent doth declare that he this Deponent going into another Room after the aforesaid Examination of the said  Abraham Gill  did not Sign or Seal any Order or Certificate for the Listing the said  Abraham Gill  as a Soldier And this Deponent  farther saith That neither he nor any other Justices of Peace then present to the best of the Deponent's Remembrance and Belief did say or so much as mention that a Conventicle was of bad consequence or the Fanaticks ought not to be countenanced or that the generality of the Parish of  Upwell  flocked after the said  Gill  or that the Conventicle which the said  Gill  had in  Upwell  ought to be suppressed or any words to that or the like effect And this Deponent farther saith That the said  Gill  did not then pretend as this Deponent verily believes to be a Freeman of any Corporation that sent Burgesses to Parliament but this Deponent doth remember that the said  Gill  did pretend to be a Freeholder in  Lancashire  which neither this Deponent nor the rest of the Justices then present did believe for that they had been credibly informed of several Forgeries and ill Practices of the said  Gill  And this Deponent farther saith That a Warrant of  Hue and Cry  some days after coming to the Parish where this Deponent lived against the said  Gill  and others this Deponent according to his Duty caused the same to be sent forward  David Rowlands  FRancis Fern  Prebendary of  Ely  and one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the Isle of  Ely  maketh Oath That  Abraham Gill  of  Welney  was brought before him and four other Justices of the Peace for the said Isle and upon the hearing of what was said concerning the said  Abraham Gill  and what the said  Abraham Gill  said for himself this Deponent was of Opinion as also the four other Justices of the Peace that the said  Abraham Gill  might and ought according to the late Act of Parliament for Raising Recruits for her Majesty's Forces be Listed in Her Majesty's Service But notwithstanding this his Opinion this Deponent saith That being called into another Room in the Inn about other business He this Deponent  did not Sign or Seal any Certificate  Order or Warrant to adjudge the said  Abraham Gill  to be a Soldier Listed according to the said Act And whereas the said  Abraham Gill  in his Affidavit affirmeth that he is a Preacher to a Congregation of Protestant Dissenters Licensed according to Law this Deponent saith That the said  Abraham Gill  did not in the Hearing of this Deponent make any Proof or so much as offer to make any Proof that he had qualified himself as the  Law directs to be a Preacher or Teacher in any Congregation of Protestants Dissenting from the Church of  England  And whereas the said  Abraham Gill  did alledge in his Affidavit that this Deponent did say that a Conventicle was of bad Consequence and that they ought not to be countenanced and that the generality of the Parish flocked after  Abraham Gill  which would breed great Disturbances in  Upwell  as it did all over  England  this Deponent saith that he this Deponent did never speak those Words or any Words to that effect  Fran Fern  JOhn Bellamy  of  Wisbech  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  Esq  one of Her Majesty's Justices of the Peace for the said Isle maketh Oath That  Abraham Gill  of  Welney  in the said Isle of  Ely  is and has been all along a Person of a very infamous Reputation by the Accounts this Deponent has received of him being under the Character of cohabiting with two Wives or Women at the same time and having Children by them both and of being a drunken and debauch'd Man and saith that He the said  Gill  amongst others was brought before this Deponent as a Person fit to be Imprest into Her Majesty's Service according to the late Act of Parliament made for that purpose where were present at the same time  Josia Colvile    Ralph Peirson  and  David Rowlands  Esquires and  Francis Fern  Clerk all of them Justices of the Peace for the said Isle of  Ely  when this Deponent made no Objection to the said  Gill  's being Inlisted according to the said Act any more than the said other Justices saving that the said  Gill  alledged that he had a Freehold at  Wigan  in  Lincolnshire  of l per Ann to the best of this Deponent's Remembrance He this Deponent believes he might desire some time might be given him to make that appear if it could be done But this Deponent doth deny that he ever had any account from  Norwich  that the said  Gill  's Licence was good or that he knew any thing certain of that matter And saith that to the best of his remembrance the said  Gill  was at the said Meeting ordered to be Imprest by all the said Justices excepting the said Mr  Colvile  who as this Deponent remembers went home before the matter was ended and that the Articles of War were read and the Listing money tender'd to him as he doth believe but withal the said  Gill  was told that if he could make it appear he had a Freehold  of forty Shillings a Year or a Right of Voting in the Election of Members of Parliament or to that effect he should be forthwith discharg'd And this Deponent saith that he knoweth of no Freehold the said  Gill  hath at  Welney  aforesaid or any where else or had at that time  J Bellamy  These are the principal Affidavits and indeed all that pretend either to excuse their Crimes or to prove his  In which the Reader is deir'd to observe That here is abundance of Recourse to  Evilfame  being  Credibly informed  Complaint  having been made  and the like referring to the Morals and Conversation of this Man and who that has Enemies of like Qualifications may not come under  all that But  'tis humbly recommended to all impartial Enquirers that are willing to be truly inform'd of this matter and who would rather hear the Truth of a Case than be Impos'd upon to consider  Here is not one positive Oath no not among all his Enemies to any of these Facts  No Man makes Oath that he ever saw him Drunk  Or That he ever Heard him swear  'Tis strange they should not if it was so Common    Or That he Broke out of Jayl  Or That he Forg'd his Orders  Or That his Licence was Forg'd  Nay The very Particulars in the  Gazette  are not so much as attempted to be Prov'd in any of these Affidavits  That he was ever Employ'd under an Attorney  Forging a second time Orders under the Hand and Seal of the Bishop of  Ely  This Forgery being Detected at  Bullingbrook  in  Lincolnshire  His being taken into Custody upon the same  His making his Escape and flying from Justice  And 'tis fairly offer'd to Mr  Jones  who we believe has been unwarily drawn into this Snare That if but any one of the abovesaid Articles can be prov'd by him Mr  Gill  will cease giving him any Trouble on account of all the rest  'Tis very hard Mr  Jones  on the bare Recommendation of any Man tho' never so great should allege such black Things as these upon an innocent Man and neither he nor his Authors  be able to make out one Clause of it from which we wish him a good Deliverance and leave that part to the Issue of the Law  Indeed we have two hardmouth'd Fellows that swear heartily but these discover so little Wit with their Goodwill that the easiness of proving them Perjur'd will be as much a Scandal upon their Senses as their Honesty we mean Mr  Lateward  and Mr  Fowlis  Mr  Gill  's Clark  Wherefore we shall begin with this swearing Curate whose Oath is That Mr  Gill  owns a Child by the Name of  Abraham Gill  which is elder than a Child he had by his first Wife  No Man but Mr  Lateward  would ha' been caught in such a  FoolTrap  and have sworn what is so exceeding easie to be detected the Children being to be produc'd and their Ages prov'd  Now 'tis plain and known to all the Neighbourhood and a thing in which 'tis impossible the Truth can be conceal'd that Mr  Gill  's first Wife has been dead upwards of seven Years and the eldest Child he has by his present Wife is but five Years and half old or thereabout  The necessary Proof of this is omitted here not that it is not the most easie of all this Affair to make out but because it being to come before a Court of Justice as matter of Evidence 'tis referr'd to the genuine Proof of fact and the Issue on a Tryal when Mr  Lateward  will do well to produce this little  Abraham in nubibus  and prove his Age and the Time of the Death of the first Wife and Marriage of the second and see how he can make these things out  As to the Clerk's Affidavit he has frequently own'd in Mr  Gill  's hearing since that he was drunk when he made it and that he knew not what was in it and that if he had known there had been any such thing in it he would not have offer'd to ha' sworn it  'Tis a most unaccountable thing that Mr  Lateward  should so far expose himself in his Affidavit when the Children are all alive born in the same Place their Age register'd in the Parishbook and so many living Witnesses of the Time of their Birth and we blush for him to think if he is not hardned beyond the very Father of Lyes himself what Confusion he must be in when he shall be ask'd to produce this Child of Mr  Gill  that must be above nine Years old or to name where it was Born when Registred or any Circumstances of the matter  So much is Malice frequently forsaken of its Sence that the just regard Providence always shews to Injur'd Innocence is the Safety of all honest Men causing the Subtilty of wicked false Accusers to abandon them and their Folly as well as Wickedness to go  hand in hand that Sin and Shame might come together and their false Accusation carry its Detection in it self  If these Gentlemen have any farther Defence to make any more Affidavits to bring into Court the Editor of this promises them to give them their full and free place in the second part of this History but humbly desires them whether Clergymen or Magistrates that for the Honour and Dignity of their Offices and Character and the Justification of their Understandings that they would either more nicely adhere to the Matter of Fact or more politickly conceal the vicious part that they may not expose themselves and force their humble Servants to detect them to avoid the Scandal of Blindness and Stupidity that they would leave Trifling Circling and going Roundabout Mr  Gill  's Character with  Supposes  we  have Heard  and we  are Inform'd  and Says that  he is inform'd  and the like but that they would rather tell us plainly and make it out When he was Drunk or Swore or Broke Jayl or Forg'd Orders or Liv'd Scandalously for certainly Gentlemen these things ought to be made out or else to suggest them is a most barbarous Treatment and a Slander that redounds to the Infamy of the Contrivers  AND now we come to present the World with the Account Mr  Gill  gives of himself not from his own Mouth but from the Mouth of numerous Throngs of Neighbours Inhabitants and Persons both knowing his Character and willing to do Justice  And first to obviate the Scandal of his having Forg'd the Hand and Seal of the Bishop of  Chester  and only pretended to have enter'd into Holy Orders besides the Original Orders left as aforesaid take the Testimony of a Minister of the Church of  England  who was Ordain'd at the same time as follows  RIchard Tod  of  Bonwick  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  Clerk maketh Oath That  Abraham Gill  of  Welney  in the said Isle and County Clerk now a Preacher to a Dissenting Congregation at  Upwell  in  Norfolk  was Ordained by  Nicholas  Lord Bishop of  Chester  upon the same Day that this Deponent and five other Youngmen was Ordained that is to say at  Trinity  in the Year of our Lord and received his Letters of Orders as we all did under the Episcopal Seal of the Lord Bishop of  Chester  aforesaid  Rich Tod  This honest Gentleman is unhappily dead since the making this Affidavit or else we had received a larger Account of the Particulars of Mr  Gill  's Ordination and the Names of the five other young Ministers Ordain'd at the same time but the Authentick Affidavit together with the Original Orders under the Episcopal Seal left as before with Mr  Skey  is Testimony sufficient to clear Mr  Gill  and all that cavil at it are challeng'd to do their utmost to detect any Forgery Collusion or Crime whatsoever  From clearing up this Point we come to his Character as well in  Lancashire  from whence he came where he was born and liv'd several Years as in  Norfolk  where all this Tragedy has been acted And first from  Rivington  where he was born and where his Father yet lives the following Certificate has been sent up Sign'd by the Reverend Mr  Bradly  and the principal Inhabitants the Original whereof is left as before with the rest of the Papers relating to this Story  THis is to Certifie all Persons whom it may concern That  Abraham Gill  Son of  Robert Gill  of  Rivington  in the County of  Lancaster  lived many Years in our Neighbourhood both before and after he was married and that in all that time he lived soberly free from any Aspersion of Drunkenness or profane Swearing that ever we knew or heard of and that he married a Woman of good Reputation for Modesty Sobriety and Chastity as far as ever we know by whom he had a Daughter in these Parts yet living and some other Children departed this life some Years ago We never knew nor credibly heard that he had any other Wife either in  Lancashire  or any other place during all the time of her life who as we have heard and do believe lived with him at the time of her Death This We sometimes his Neighbours and Acquaintance do hereby Attest witness our Hands the th Day of  November    Schoolmasters at  Rivington  John Bradley  Edm Sweetlove  James Hart  Adam Turner  Henry Ainsworth  Thomas Whalley  John Horrobin  James Worsley  Thomas Entusles  Rich Foster  Thomas Balshaw  Robert Foster  Tho Mother  George Lee  John Shaw  John Alatt  Tho Nightingall  William Breres  Rich Brownlow  It seems while Mr  Gill  was in  Lancashire  and before he was entred into Orders he serv'd my Lord  Will  by  of  Parham  as his Chaplain Steward or Attendant  The Enemies of Mr  Gill  have been as he is informed so diligent to attack this noble Lord in order to obtain a Complaint against Mr  Gill  there having been some Difference as they said between them at parting but being not able to obtain any Certificate from his Lordship against Mr  Gill  they became Petitioners to his Lordship that as he would give them nothing under his Hand against Mr  Gill  so he would refuse to grant Mr  Gill  any thing under his hand in his Justification We shall not examine into the Justice of this Proceeding his Lordship no doubt had his Reasons for it but the Attempt either way is a manifest Proof the Enemies of Mr  Gill  have rummaged the Nation for his Character and left no Stone unturn'd in order to fix the Scandals they have endeavour'd to raise on his Reputation  But tho' this noble Lord declin'd meddling on one hand or other Mr  Gill  has obtain'd more Justice from his Brotherinlaw who at second hand from my Lord's own mouth has given an honourable Testimony of Mr  Gill  to Mr  Gill  's own Father and sent up under his Hand as follows  Mr  Gill  's Father's Letter is thus  Rivington    Nov  Loving Son  I Am sorry to hear that you are in trouble I sent to my Lord  Willoughby  for his Certificate but I heard that your Adversaries had prevented him but I did not hear it from my Lord But I thought that Mr  Grenehalgh  's Certificate would not be much inferior because he married my Lord  Willoughby  's Sister and that you were both Boarded at his House And if you will have any Certificate from the Neighbourhood I question not but they will all Certifie for you So hoping you are in good health as we are all at present praised be God I remain  Your ever Loving Father whilst ROBERT GILL  The Certificate thus  Adlington    Nov    THese may Certifie whom it may concern That my Lord  Willoughby  and Mr  Abraham Gill  were Boarded at my House together for two Years and upwards and since Mr  Gill  left my Lord's Service I have heard my Lord commend Mr  Gill  saying he was the best Servant he ever  had and I have known Mr  Gill  from a Child and he being in my Family as aforesaid was faithful and just all the time and was a Man of sober Life and Conversation As witness my Hand  Sa Grenehalgh  Next to this and besides Mr  Gill  's Affidavit already mentioned of his being a Freeholder in  Lancashire  which the Justices will find they ought to have considered here follows an Affidavit of the same and of his being a Freeman or Burgess of a Corporation and by both these he had a Right of Voting in the Election of Members of Parliament and consequently was exempted by the very Act of Parliament by which they pretended to send him for a Soldier  OLiver Greenhalgh  of  Horwich  in the County of  Lancaster  maketh Oath That he this Deponent very well knows  Abraham Gill  the Son of  Robert Gill  of  Rivington  in this County And this Deponent farther saith That the said  Abraham Gill  is now legally intitled for the term of his natural Life of and in several Closes or Parcels of Land lying in  Rivington  aforesaid of the clear yearly value of forty Shillings  per Ann  and upwards And moreover this Deponent saith That Mr  Ralph Banks  TownClerk for the Borough of  Wigan  in this County shewed him this Deponent his Record or Roll kept for the said Burrough wherein was mentioned that on the th Day of  September  to this Deponent's best remembrance the said  Abraham Gill  was Sworn a Burgess within the said Borough of  Wigan  Oliver Greenhalgh  From  Lancashire  we are to trace him into the Isle of  Ely  whither he came with his Family and settled as has been already noted in the Parish of  Maney  where he Preach'd two years Of which and his Behaviour there take the following Certificate Sworn to by Ten of the Inhabitants of that little Town  THomas Harrison  of  Maney  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  Yeoman  Richard Bellamy    William Cross    Thomas Benn    William Curtis    William Hales    William Page  and  Thomas Neale  all of  Maney  aforesaid  Richard Finch  and  Edward Newborne  of the same maketh Oath That they have known Mr  Abraham Gill  now Minister of a Dissenting  Congregation at  Upwell  this ten or twelve Years or thereabouts He was our Minister for about two Years and well settled in our Parish with his Wife who lived together very conformable and peaceably He was Able and Diligent in his Teaching he was no Drunkard nor Swearer but lived a pious Life and Conversation amongst us And these Deponents do farther say that to their knowledge the said Mr  Gill  never had two Wives living at one time but that he married his now Wife after his former Wife's Decease  Tho Harrison  Rich Bellamy  Will Crosse  Tho Benn  Will Corties  Will Hales  Will Page  Tho Neale  Rich Finch  Edw Newborn  For his Behaviour in  Upwell  where he has since resided and which has been the Scene of this Tragedy take the two following Affidavits  Edward Birch  of  Wimblington  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  Gent maketh Oath That  Abraham Gill  of  Welney  in the Isle and County aforesaid is a Preacher to a Congregation of Protestant Dissenting Subjects in  Upwell  in the County of  Norfolk  and that the said Mr  Gill  hath been a Preacher in and about  Welney  aforesaid for several Years last past and that he is now and all the time hath been well approved of for a Teacher and very charitable to the Poor and hath lived well in Fame and Plenty amongst his Neighbours But this Deponent farther saith That he believes Mr  James  Rector of  Upwell  and Mr  Lateward  Curate at  Welney  have maliciously designed to ruin the said Mr  Gill  and his Family consisting of a Wife and four small Children for they have been very troublesome to the said Mr  Gill  for near two Years having caused him to spend very much Money in defending himself from their unjust and malicious Prosecution so that they have now reduced him to Poverty and at last would force him away for a Soldier from his Congregation where he is beloved and may have very good Maintenance And this Deponent farther saith He was with Mr  Gill  at  Cambridge  in the Months of  March    April  and  May  in where Mr  Gill  was a long time kept Prisoner at the Complaint of Mr  James  without any Cause shewed at all and at the Request of Mr  Gill  and several of his  good Friends he this Deponent and one Mr  Thomas Neale  Bailed Mr  Gill  out of Jayl Mr  Gill  being bound in l and this Deponent and Mr  Neale  in l each of them and Mr  Gill  appeared the next Sessions then after and as there had been no Cause of his Imprisonment before so nothing appeared against him still as the Court declared but they removed him to  Norwich  Assizes from thence where this Deponent hath heard and believes that upon Mr  Gill  's staying all the time of Assizes  July  last and nothing could be brought against him he was discharged by my Lord Chief Justice  Holt  and my Lord Baron  Smith  or one of them And this Deponent believes that Mr  Gill  never gave any Cause of Offence to Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  except it was by being more charitable to the Poor and more diligent and better beloved and approved in his Place than they are  Edward Birch  JOhn Johnson  of  Upwell  in the County of  Norfolk  Yeoman maketh Oath That  Abraham Gill  of  Welney  in the Isle of  Ely  in the County of  Cambridge  is a Preacher to a Congregation of Her Majesty's Protestant Dissenting Subjects in  Upwell  aforesaid and that the said  Abraham Gill  hath been a Preacher in the said Parish of  Welney  for several Years last past and that he is now and all the time hath been well approved of by his Congregation And this Deponent farther saith That about the latter end of  April  last past it was reported at  Upwell  aforesaid That Mr  Gill  was Impressed and sent away for a Soldier to the great sorrow and grief of the greatest part of the Parish and that he this Deponent about that time going to  Wisbech  aforesaid to see Mr  Gill  found him an Impressed Man and guarded amongst others that were Impressed Men and kept as Prisoners in a Room in an Inn in  Wisbech  aforesaid And this Deponent verily believes That Mr  Hugh James  Rector of  Upwell  and Mr  Lateward  Curate at  Welney  have maliciously designed to ruin and undo Mr  Gill  and his Family consisting of a Wife and four small Children for they have by several barbarous ways of Prosecution brought the said Mr  Gill  and his Family to Poverty notwithstanding Mr  Gill  hath been a Freeholder in the said Parish and lived in Plenty amongst his Neighbours and is now generally beloved except with a few that dare not displease Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  And this Deponent verily believes all the Cause of Mr  James  and Mr  Lateward  's Malice against  Mr  Gill  is because Mr  Gill  Preached oftner and better was more diligent in his Ministry and more charitable to the Poor and better approved of in the Parish than they are  John Johnson  From hence let us follow him in his Afflictions and in the very Prison we find the Jaylor  who was a Woman  testifying to his Sobriety his Piety and his Charity  ELizabeth Heylock  Keeper of the  Tolbooth  in the Town of  Cambridge  Widow maketh Oath That  Abraham Gill  of  Welney  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  Gent hath been in her Custody as a Prisoner for some time and during all the time of his Imprisonment he lived Soberly Honestly and Religiously insomuch that by his Christianlike Behaviour and Conversation from his coming into Prison till the time he was released he so prevailed upon the other Prisoners that there was a Reformation amongst them And this Deponent farther saith That when any Money was given to the Prisoners to Drink he the said Mr  Gill  shunned Drinking to Excess and constantly advised others against Drinking more than was necessary to refresh Nature and carry'd himself soberly and honestly towards all the People in Custody and others also  Elizabeth Heylock  We next bring you a Tradesman of  Cambridge  one of his Creditors and a Person that has reason to know him both while he was a Prisoner there and before who Testifies both from personal Knowledge and publick Enquiry and by him you have even the Voice of Common Fame So that this Affidavit seems to contradict those Gentlemen who say he was a Man of ill Fame amongst his Neighbours turbulent and disorderly or bred a Disturbance in the Parish as in Mr Justice  Upwood  's and other Affidavits  RIchard Jardine  of  Cambridge  in the County of  Cambridge  LinnenDraper maketh Oath That for this six Years last past he has been intimately acquainted with  Abraham Gill  of  Welney  in the Isle of  Ely  and County of  Cambridge  Gent And that during all this Deponent's Acquaintance with him he has had the Character of an honest sober peaceable Man And farther  saith That he this Deponent has had frequent occasion by means of his Trade and other Business to be in the Country where the said  Abraham Gill  did formerly live and doth now live and has been oftentimes in the said Mr  Gill  's Company and never at any time found him disorderly irreligious or any ways vicious in his Conversation And this Deponent hath heard among the Neighbourhood where the said Mr  Gill  lived That if any Controversies Quarrels or Suits of Law did happen in his Neighbourhood among the Neighbours he always offered his Mediation and recommended Peace amongst them and has by that means ended several Differences and Disputes between his Neighbours And farther saith That the said Mr  Gill  is very well beloved by the Parishioners of  Welney  and the neighbouring Parishes and gives good Content and Satisfaction amongst them and hath been charitable to the Poor and obedient to the Late as well as this Present Government And saith That within this twenty Days his this Deponent's Business called him to  Welney  where he made a Visit to the said Mr  Gill  and found him in a very weak and poor Condition having been afflicted with Sickness for a considerable time as he and the Neighbourhood told this Deponent  Richard Jardine  And yet more effectually to settle this matter of Character and Reputation among Neighbours we conclude it with the Affidavit of fourteen more of the Inhabitants of his Parish and Neighbours and when all is done let any of his Antagonists produce better Vouchers for their Reputation if they can  WIlliam Gibson of  Upwell  in the County of  Norfolk  Yeoman    James Seaman  of the same Town and County    Robert Macum    Robert Gill    Richard Tokelove    George Slacksbe    Joseph Sampson    Thomas Watson    Peter Sumers    John Marriott    Benjamin Silke    Valentine Smith    William Mann    Robert Macum  jun do severally make Oath That Mr  Abraham Gill  a Preacher to a Congregation in  Upwell  hath for seven or eight Years last past been a Preacher in the said Parish and was never to our Knowledge a common Drunkard nor Swearer nor had two Wives at once but had one Wife and after her Decease married another And that the said Mr  Gill  hath been and is a Man of very sober pious Life and Conversation and such a one as we desire may still be our Minister  William Gibson  James Seaman  Robert Macum  sen  Robert Gill  Richard Tokelove  George Slacksbe  Joseph Sampson  Thomas Watson  Peter Sumers  John Marriott  Benjamin Silke  Valentine Smith  William Mann  Robert Macum  And to finish these Vouchers here is the Licence for the Meeting affix'd which they have never attempted to prove Forg'd any more than they have Mr  Gill  's Orders  By vertue and in pursuance of a certain Clause or Proviso in this behalf mentioned and contained in an Act of Parliament or Statute made in the first Year of the Reign of King  William  and Queen  Mary  intitled  An Act for exempting Their Majesties Protestant Subjects dissenting from the Church of  England  from the Penalty of certain Laws  These are humbly to Certifie and it is hereby Certified unto the Worshipful  John Jeffery  Clerk Master of Arts Archdeacon of the Archdeaconry of  Norwich  That the Dwellinghouse or Barn of  Upwell  in the County of  Norfolk  is a Place used and to be used for holding and keeping Meetings and Assemblies of divers Persons of Her Majesty's Protestant Dissenting Subjects Dissenting from the Church of  England  for the Exercise of Religious Worship  In Witness  whereof I have hereunto set my Hand this th Day of  March Ann Dom    Richard Tokelove  And  Gentlemen to go farther with our Adversaries than they can expect we shouldwhat if we should suppose for once that this  Abraham Gill  was this immoral Man they speak of if he was such a refin'd Cheat as to have Deluded all the  Many    many honest People  who have Sworn to his Character for who knows how far the Wit and Subtilty of Man under the Agency of a hardned Mind may furnish a Man and what Mists the Devil may have laid before the Eyes of Mankind that this Man should be a Common Drunkard and Swearer and Cohabiter with two Women at once and a Congregation of several Hundreds of his Hearers where he  liv'd all the time know nothing of it nor his Enemies be able to produce one Affidavit of any Man that ever saw him Drunk or heard him Swear  But suppose these strange things come to pass for the World is full of strange things what can be Inferr'd from hence to justifie the Treatment he has receiv'd and all the Dissenters through his Interest  But on this premis'd Supposition I crave leave to draw a few Inferences which shall serve to the Close of this Work  All the Forgeries all the Swearings Drunkennesses and Lewdness they pretend to charge upon him are antecedent to his being a Dissenter and we do not find he receiv'd the least Disturbance in the Execution of his Function on account of these known Immoralities and might to this day have kept his two Women and his Cure of Souls both together as too many of his Brethren have done before him and are like to do after him for any great Care we see taken to prevent it had he but continued to read the Common Prayer  I forbear to discant upon this unhappy Truth and of the many known Instances of an immoral Clergy shall repeat none but rather cover the Infirmities of our Guides that the Obligation if possible may move them both to reform and to hide those of their Neighbours  Were all the Immoralities he is charg'd with True they are not comparable to those committed in his Prosecution the Perjuries Subornations Cruelties Injustice and illegal Proceedings are intolerable This is Casting out Devils by  Beelzebub  the Prince of Devils This is the Devil turn'd Reformer  What's all this to going for a Soldier If every Clergyman must be Listed that will be Drunk if Swearing an Oath will pull a Man's Band off and send him to the Army if every Clergyman that keeps a Woman more than he should do must go into the Army  Lord have mercy  and  a Cross  ought to be set upon the Doors of a great many ChurchTenements and perhaps we need not have so many severe Acts of Parliament for raising Recruits  Wherefore upon the whole matter we are not so concern'd to Vindicate Mr  Gill  's Character since were he all they could alledge it does not in the least palliate or excuse their Dealings with him nor will it be any Extenuation of their illegal Practices when it comes to be Examin'd before a Court of Justice  'Tis therefore enough Let them rummage Mr  Gill  's Character to the bottom let them confute the many Affidavits we have  produced perswade the World to believe him an ill Man a Drunkard a Swearer a Whoremaster or any thing we humbly conceive it is all against them still for they do not Persecute him as an Immoral Man if they had why did they not do it long before for it must have been known then but they Persecute him as a Dissenter a Disturber of the Neighbours with a Conventicle Preaching in  Welney Chapel  without Reading the Common Prayer these were the Crimes All his Vices if they were true  which nevertheless we do not grant  were committed while he was  Mr  Gill  the Curate  not since he was  Mr  Gill  the Dissenter  He was  Their Mr  Gill when they say he kept an ill Woman he is unaccus'd of the least Immorality since he was  Our Mr  Gill What will they say to this part of it This makes it a peculiar Pique at a Party a Push made at the Dissenters a Sally of the Method call'd  The shortest way  sending our Ministers  a Colonelling  Voting them a sort of People that do not live by a lawful Calling and can give no good Account of themselves and therefore in the Eye of the Law are Vagabonds and may all be Listed for Soldiers  c  We have therefore nothing more to say for Mr  Gill  we need not undertake the Vindication of his Morals we have the Inhabitants where he was Born and
