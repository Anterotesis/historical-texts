LIVES OF THE POETS  Sir JOHN DENHAM  _AN eminent poet of the th century was the only son of Sir John Denham knight of Little Horsley in Essex and some time baron of the Exchequer in Ireland and one of the lords justices of that kingdom He was born in Dublin in the year  Ath Oxon vol ii  but was brought over from thence very young on his father's being made one of the barons of the Exchequer in England  He received his education in grammar learning in London and in Michaelmas term he was entered a gentleman commoner in Trinity College Oxford being then years of age where as Wood expresses it  'being looked upon as a slow dreaming young man and more addicted to gaming than study they could never imagine he could ever enrich the world with the issue of his brain as he afterwards did'  He remained three years at the university and having been examined at the public schools for the degree of bachelor of arts he entered himself in Lincoln'sInn where he was generally thought to apply himself pretty closely to the study of the common law But notwithstanding his application to study and all the efforts he was capable of making such was his propensity to gaming that he was often stript of all his money and his father severely chiding him and threatning to abandon him if he did not reform he wrote a little essay against that vice and presented it to his father to convince him of his resolution against it  Wood  But no sooner did his father die than being unrestrained by paternal authority he reassumed the practice and soon squandered away several thousand pounds  In the latter end of the year he published a tragedy called the Sophy which was greatly admired and gave Mr Waller occasion to say of our author  'That he broke out like the Irish rebellion threescore thousand strong when no body was aware nor in the least expected it'  Soon after this he was pricked for high sheriff for the county of Surry and made governor of FarnhamCastle for the King but not being well skilled in military affairs he soon quitted that post and retired to his Majesty at Oxford  where he published an excellent poem called Cooper'shill often reprinted before and since the restoration with considerable alterations it has been universally admired by all good judges and was translated into Latin verse by Mr Moses Pengry of Oxford  Mr Dryden speaking of this piece in his dedication of his Rival Ladies says that it is a poem which for the Majesty of the stile will ever be the exact standard of good writing and the noble author of an essay on human life bestows upon it the most lavish encomium  In the preface to d edition to  But of all the evidences in its favour none is of greater authority or more beautiful than the following of Mr Pope in his Windsor Forest  Ye sacred nine that all my soul possess  Whose raptures fire me and whose visions bless  Bear me O bear me to sequester'd scenes  The bow'ry mazes and surrounding greens  To Thames's bank which fragrant breezes fill  Or where the muses sport on Cooper'shill  On Cooper's hill eternal wreaths shall grow  While lasts the mountain or while Thames shall flow  I seem thro' consecrated walks to rove  I hear soft music die along the grove  Led by the sound I roam from shade to shade  By godlike poets venerable made  Here his last lays majestic Denham sung  There the last numbers flow'd from Cowley's tongue  In the year he was entrusted by the Queen with a message to the King then in the hands of  the army and employed in other affairs relating to his Majesty In his dedication of his poems to Charles II he observes that after the delivery of the person of his royal father into the hands of the army he undertook for the Queenmother to get access to his Majesty which he did by means of Hugh Peters and upon this occasion the King discoursed with him without reserve upon the state of his affairs At his departure from Hamptoncourt says he  'The King commanded me to stay privately in London to send to him and receive from him all his letters from and to all his correspondents at home and abroad and I was furnished with nine several cyphers in order to it Which I trust I performed with great safety to the persons with whom we corresponded but about nine months after being discovered by their knowledge of Mr Cowley's hand I happily escaped both for myself and those who held correspondence with me'  In April he conveyed away James duke of York then under the tuition of Algernon earl of Northumberland from St James's and carried him into France to the prince of Wales and Queenmother This circumstance is related by Wood but Clarendon who is a higher authority says that the duke went off with colonel Bamfield only who contrived the means of his escape Not long after he was sent embassador to the King of Poland in conjunction with lord Crofts to whom he addresses a poem written on their journey from whence he brought ten thousand pounds for his Majesty by the decimation of his Scottish subjects there  About the year he returned into England and was well received by the earl of Pembroke at Wilton and continued with that nobleman about a year for his own fortune by the expence he was at during the civil war and his unconquerable  itch of gaming was quite exhausted From that year to the restoration there are no accounts of our author but as soon as his Majesty returned he entered upon the office of surveyor of his Majesty's buildings in the room of Inigo Jones deceased and at the coronation of King Charles II was created a knight of the Bath Upon some discontent arising from his second marriage he lost his senses but soon recovering from that disorder he continued in great esteem at court for his poetical writings In the dedication of his poems to King Charles II he tells us that he had been discouraged by King Charles I from writing verses  'One morning says he when I was waiting upon the King at Causham smiling upon me he said he could tell me some news of myself which was that he had seen some verses of mine the evening before being those to Sir Robert Fanshaw and asking me when I made them I told him two or three years since he was pleased to say that having never seen them before he was afraid I had written them since my return into England and though he liked them well he would advise me to write no more alledging that when men are young and having little else to do they might vent the overflowings of their fancy that way but when they were thought fit for more serious employments if they still persisted in that course it would look as if they minded not the way to any better whereupon I stood corrected as long as I had the honour to wait upon him'  This is a strong instance of his duty to the King but no great compliment to his Majesty's taste nor was the public much obliged to the Monarch for this admonition to our author  But King Charles II being of an humour more sprightly than his father was a professed encourager of poetry and in his time a race of wits sprung up unequalled by those of any other reign  This monarch was particularly delighted with the poetry of our author especially when he had the happiness to wait upon him in Holland and Flanders and he was pleased sometimes to give him arguments to write upon and divert the evil hours of their banishment which now and then Sir John tells us he acquitted himself not much short of his Majesty's expectation  In the year Sir John Denham died at his office in Whitehall and was interred in WestminsterAbbey near the tombs of Chaucer Spenser and Cowley  Our author's works are  Cooper'shill of which we have already taken some notice  The Destruction of Troy an Essay on the second book of Virgil's Aeneis written  On the Earl of Strafford's Trial and Death  On my Lord Crofts's Journey into Poland  On Mr Thomas Killegrew's return from Venice and Mr William Murrey's from Scotland  To Sir John Mennis being invited from Calais to Bologne to eat a pig  Natura Naturata  Sarpedon's Speech to Glaucus in the twelfth book of Homer  Out of an Epigram of Martial  Friendship and single Life against Love and Marriage  On Mr Abraham Cowley's Death and Burial  A Speech against Peace at the Close Committee  To the Five Members of the honourable House of Commons The humble Petition of the Poets  A Western Wonder  A Second Western Wonder  News from Colchester or a proper new Ballad of certain carnal Passages betwixt a Quaker and a Colt at Horsley in Essex  A Song  On Mr John Fletcher's Works  To Sir Richard Fanshaw on his translation of Pastor Fido  A Dialogue between Sir John Pooley and Mr Thomas Killegrew  An occasional Imitation of a modern Author upon a Game at Chess  The Passion of Dido for Aeneas  Of Prudence of Justice  The Progress of Learning  Cato Major of old Age a Poem It is taken from the Latin of Tully though much alter'd from the original not only by the change of the stile but by addition and subtraction Our author tells us that intending to translate this piece into prose where translation ought to be strict sinding the matter very proper for verse he took the liberty to leave out what was only necessary to that age and place and to take or add what was proper to this present age and occasion by laying the scene clearer and in fewer words according to the stile and car of the times  The Sophy a Tragedy the above pieces have been several times printed together in one volume in mo under the Title of Poems and Translations with the Sophy a Tragedy written by Sir John Denham  Besides these Wood mentions a Pa  egyric on his excellency general Monk in one sheet quarto Though Denham's name is not to it it is generally ascribed to him A Prologue to his majesty at the first play represented at the Cockpit in Whitehall being part of that noble entertainment which their majesties received November from his grace the duke of Albemarle A new Version of the Psalms of David The True Presbyterian without Disguise or a Character of a Presbyterian's Ways and Actions London in half a sheet in folio In the year there were printed by stealth in octavo certain Poems intitled Directions to a Painter in four copies or parts each dedicated to king Charles the IId They were very satyrically written against several persons engaged in the Dutch war in At the end of them was a piece entitled Clarendon's Housewarming and after that his Epitaph both containing bitter reflexions against that earl Sir John Denham's name is to these pieces but they were generally thought to be written by Andrew Marvel  Esq  a Merry Droll in Charles the IId's Parliaments but so very honest that when a minister once called at his lodgings to tamper with him about his vote he found him in mean apartments up two pair of stairs and though he was obliged to send out that very morning to borrow a guinea yet he was not to be corrupted by the minister but denied him his vote The printer of these poems being discovered he was sentenced to stand in the pillory for the same  We have met with no authors who have given any account of the moral character of Sir John Denham and as none have mentioned his virtues so we find no vice imputed to him but that of gaming to which it appears he was immoderately addicted If we may judge from his works he was a good natur'd man an easy companion and in the day of danger and tumult of unshaken loyalty to the suffering interest  of his sovereign His character as a poet is well known he has the fairest testimonies in his favour the voice of the world and the sanction of the critics Dryden and Pope praise him and when these are mentioned other authorities are superfluous  We shall select as a specimen of Sir John Denham's Poetry his Elegy on his much loved and admired friend Mr Abraham Cowley  Old mother Wit and nature gave  Shakespear and Fletcher all they have  In Spencer and in Johnson art  O slower nature got the start  But both in him so equal are  None knows which bears the happiest share  To him no author was unknown  Yet what he wrote was all his own  He melted not the antient gold  Nor with Ben Johnson did make bold  To plunder all the Roman stores  Of poets and of orators  Horace's wit and Virgil's state  He did not steal but emulate  And he would like to them appear  Their garb but not their cloaths did wear  He not from Rome alone but Greece  Like Johnson brought the golden fleece  And a stiff gale as Flaccus sings  The Theban swan extends his wings  When thro' th' aethereal clouds he flies  To the same pitch our swan doth rise  Old Pindar's flights by him newreach'd  When on that gale his wings are stretch'd  THOMAS KILLEGREW  A Gentleman who was page of honour to king Charles I and groom of the bedchamber to king Charles II with whom he endured twentyyears exile During his abode beyond sea he took a view of France Italy and Spain and was honoured by his majesty with the employment of resident at the state of Venice whither he was sent in August During his exile abroad he applied his leisure hours to the study of poetry and the composition of several plays of which Sir John Denham in a jocular way takes notice in his copy of verses on our author's return from his embassy from Venice  I  Our resident Tom  From Venice is come  And hath left the statesman behind him  Talks at the same pitch  Is as wise is as rich  And just where you left him you find him  II  But who says he was not  A man of much plot  May repent that false accusation  Having plotted and penn'd  Six plays to attend  The farce of his negotiation  Killegrew was a man of very great humour and frequently diverted king Charles II by his lively spirit of mirth and drollery He was frequently at court and had often access to king Charles when admission was denied to the first peers in the realm Amongst many other merry stories the following is related of Killegrew Charles II who hated business as much as he loved pleasure would often disappoint the council in vouchsafing his royal presence when they were met by which their business was necessarily delay'd and many of the council much offended by the disrespect thrown on them It happened one day while the council were met and had sat some time in expectation of his majesty that the duke of Lauderdale who was a furious ungovernable man quitted the room in a passion and accidentally met with Killegrew to whom he expressed himself irreverently of the king Killegrew bid his grace be calm for he would lay a wager of a hundred pounds that he would make his majesty come to council in less than half an hour Lauderdale being a little heated and under the influence of surprize took him at his wordKillegrew went to the king and without ceremony told him what had happened and added  "I know that your majesty hates Lauderdale tho' the necessity of your affairs obliges you to behave civilly to him now if you would get rid of a man you hate come to the council for Lauderdale is a man so boundlesly avaritious that rather than pay the hundred pounds lost in this wager he will hang himself and never plague you more"  The king was pleased with the archness of this observation and answered  'then Killegrew I'll positively go'  which he didIt is likewise related that upon the king's suffering his mistresses to gain so great an ascendant over him as to sacrifice for them the interest of the state and neglect the most important affairs while like another Sardanapalus he wasted his hours in the apartments of  those enchantresses Killegrew went one day into his apartment dress'd like a pilgrim bent upon a long journey The king being surprized at this extraordinary frolic asked him the meaning of it and to what distant country he was going to which Killegrew bluntly answered the country I seek may it please your majesty is hell and what to do there replies the king to bring up Oliver Cromwel from thence returned the wag to take care of the English affairs for his successor takes noneWe cannot particularly ascertain the truth of these relations but we may venture to assert that they are not improbable when it is considered how much delighted king Charles the IId was with a joke however severe and that there was not at court a more likely p  rson to pass them than Killegrew who from his long exile with the king and being about his person had contracted a kind of familiarity which the lustre that was thrown round the prince upon his restoration was not sufficient to check  Tho' Sir John Denham mentions but six our author wrote nine Plays in his travels and two at London amongst which his Don Thomaso in two parts and his Parson's Wedding will always be valued by good judges and are the best of his performances The following is a list of his plays  Bellamira's Dream or Love of Shadows a TragiComedy the first part printed in folio written in Venice and dedicated to the lady Mary Villiers duchess of Richmond and Lennox  Bellamira's Dream the second part written in Venice printed in folio London and dedicated to the lady Anne Villiers countess of Essex  Cicilia and Clorinda or Love in Arms a Tragicomedy the first part printed in folio London written in Turin  Cicilia and Clorinda the second part written at Florence and dedicated to the lady Dorothy Sidney countess of Sunderland  Claracilla a Tragicomedy printed in solio London written at Rome and dedicated to his sister inlaw lady Shannon on this play and another of the author's called the Prisoners Mr Cartwright has written an ingenious copy of verses  The Parson's Wedding a Comedy printed in folio London written at Basil in Switzerland This play was revived at the old Theatre at little Lincoln'sInnFields and acted all by women a new prologue and epilogue being spoken by Mrs Marshal in Man's cloaths which Mr Langbain says is printed in the CoventGarden Drollery This was a miscellaneous production of those times which bore some resemblance to our Magazines but which in all probability is now out of print  The Pilgrim a Tragedy printed in folio London written in Paris in the year and dedicated to the countess of Carnarvon  The Princess or Love at first Sight a TragiComedy printed in folio London written at Naples and dedicated to his niece the lady Anne Wentworth wife to lord Lovelace  The Prisoners a TragiComedy printed in folio London written at London and dedicated to the lady Crompton  Don Thomaso or the Wanderer a Comedy in two parts printed in folio London and dedicated to the fair and kind friends of prince Palatine Polexander In the first part of this play the author has borrowed several ornaments from Fletcher's play called the Captain He has used great freedom with Ben Johnson for not only the characters of Lopus but even the very words are repeated from Johnson's Fox where Volpone personates Scoto of Mantua I don't believe that our author designed to conceal his assistance since he was so just as to acknowledge a song against jealousy which he borrowed from Mr Thomas Carew cupbearer to king Charles the Ist and sung in a masque at Whitehall  anno This Chorus says he  'I presume to make use of here because in the first design it was written at my request upon a dispute held between Mrs Cicilia Crofer and myself when he was present she being then maid of honour This I have set down lest any man should imagine me so foolish as to steal such a poem from so famous an author'  If he was therefore so scrupulous in committing depredations upon Carew he would be much more of Ben Johnson whose fame was so superior to Carew's All these plays were printed together in one volume in folio London  EDWARD HOWARD  Esq  WAS descended from the noble family of the earl of Berkshire and was more illustrious by his birth than his genius he addicted himself to the study of dramatic poetry and produced four plays but gained no reputation by any of them  The Man of NewMarket a Comedy acted at the TheatreRoyal and printed in quarto London  Six Days Adventure or the New Utopia a Comedy acted at his royal highness the duke of York's Theatre printed in quarto This play miscarried in the action as he himself acknowledges in his preface and the earl of Rochester with his usual virulence writ an invective against it but Mrs Behn Mr Ravenscroft and some other poets taking compassion on him sent the author recommendatory verses which are printed before that play and in  return he writ a Pindarique to Mrs Behn which she printed in a Collection of Poems  The Usurper a Tragedy acted at the TheatreRoyal and printed in which the character of Damocles is said to have been drawn for Oliver Cromwel and that the play is a parallel of those times  Womens Conquest a TragiComedy acted at the Duke's Theatre  Besides these plays Mr Howard has published an Epic Poem in octavo called the British Princes which the earl of Rochester likewise handled pretty severely There is likewise ascribed to him another Book of Poems and Essays with a Paraphrase on Cicero's Laelius or Tract of Friendship printed in vo The Earl of Dorset who was called by cotemporary writers the best good man with the worst natured Muse has dedicated a few lines to the damnation of this extraordinary epic production of Mr Howard's  The Spectator observes that this epic piece is full of incongruity or in other words abounds with nonsense He quotes the two following lines  A coat of mail Prince Vortiger had on  Which from a naked pict his grandsire won  Who does not see the absurdity of winning a coat from a naked man  The earl of Dorset thus addresses him  To Mr EDWARD HOWARD on his incomparable incomprehensible POEM called the BRITISH PRINCES  Come on ye critics find one fault who dare  For read it backward like a witch's prayer  'Twill do as well throw not away your jests  On solid nonsense that abides all tests  Wit like tierceclaret when't begins to pall  Neglected lies and's of no use at all  But in its full perfection of decay  Turns vinegar and comes again in play  Thou hast a brain fuch as it is indeed  On what else should thy worm of fancy feed  Yet in a Filbert I have often known  Maggots survive when all the kernel's gone  This simile shall stand in thy defence  'Gainst such dull rogues as now and then write sense  Thy style's the same whatever be thy theme  As some digestion turns all meat to phlegm  He lyes dear Ned who says thy brain is barren  Where deep conceits like vermin breed in carrion  Thy stumbling founder'd jade can trot as high  As any other Pegasus can fly  So the dull Eel moves nimbler in the mud  Than all the swiftfinn'd racers of the flood  As skilful divers to the bottom fall  Sooner than those that cannot swim at all  So in the way of writing without thinking  Thou hast a strange alacrity in sinking  Thou writ'st below ev'n thy o  n nat'ral parts  And with acquir'd dulness and new arts  Of stud'ed nonsense tak'st kind readers hearts  Therefore dear Ned at my advice forbear  Such loud complaints 'gainst critics to prefer  Since thou art turn'd an arrant libeller  Thou sett'st thy name to what thyself do'st write  Did ever libel yet so sharply bite  Mrs APHRA BEHN  A Celebrated poetess of the last age was a gentlewoman by birth being descended as her lifewriter says from a good family in the city of Canterbury She was born in Charles Ist's reign  Memoirs prefixed to her Novels by a lady  but in what year is not known Her father's name was Johnson whose relation to the lord Willoughby engaged him for the advantageous post of lieutenant general of Surinam and six and thirty islands to undertake a voyage with his whole family to the WestIndies at which time our poetess was very young Mr Johnson died at sea in his passage thither but his family arrived at Surinam a place so delightfully situated and abounding with such a vast profusion of beauties that according to Mrs Behn's description nature seems to have joined with art to render it perfectly elegant her habitation in that country called St John's Hill she has challenged all the gardens in Italy nay all the globe of the world to shew so delightful a recess It was there our poetess became acquainted with the story and person of the American Prince Oroonoko whose adventures she has so feelingly and elegantly described in the celebrated Novel of that name upon which Mr Southern has built his Tragedy of Oroonoko part of which is so entertaining and moving that it is almost too much for nature Mrs Behn tells us that she herself had often seen and conversed with that great man and been a witness to many of  his mighty actions and that at one time he and Imoinda his wife were scarce an hour in a day from her lodgings that they eat with her and that she obliged them in all things she was capable of entertaining them with the lives of the Romans and great men which charmed him with her company while she engaged his wife with teaching her all the pretty works she was mistress of relating stories of Nuns and endeavouring to bring her to the knowledge of the true God This intimacy between Oroonoko and Mrs Behn occasioned some reflexions on her conduct from which the authoress of her life already quoted justified her in the following manner  'Here says she I can add nothing to what she has given the world already but a vindication of her from some unjust aspersions I find are insinuated about this town in relation to that prince I knew her intimately well and I believe she would not have concealed any love affair from me being one of her own sex whose friendship and secrecy she had experienced which makes me assure the world that there was no intr  gue between that Prince and Astraea She had a general value for his uncommon virtues and when he related the story of his woes she might with the Desdemona of Shakespear cry out That it was pitiful wondrous pitiful which never can be construed into an amour besides his heart was too violently set on the everlasting charms of his Imoinda to be shook with those more faint in his eye of a white beauty and Astrea's relations there present kept too watchful an eye over her to permit the frailty of her youth if that had been powerful enough'  After this lady's return to London she was married to Mr Behn a Merchant there but of Dutch extraction This marriage strengthening her interest and perhape restoring her character gave her an opportunity  of appearing with advantage at court She gave King Charles II so accurate and agreeable an account of the colony of Surinam that he conceived a great opinion of her abilities and thought her a proper person to be entrusted with the management of some important affairs during the Dutch war which occasioned her going into Flanders and residing at Antwerp Here by her political intrigues she discovered the design formed by the Dutch of sailing up the river Thames and burning the English ships in their harbours which she communicated to the court of England but her intelligence though well grounded as appeared by the event being only laughed at and slighted she laid aside all other thoughts of state affairs and amused herself during her stay at Antwerp with the gallantries in that city But as we have mentioned that she discovered the design of the Dutch to burn our ships it would be injustice to the lady as well as to the reader not to give some detail of her manner of doing it She made this discovery by the intervention of a Dutchman whom her lifewriter calls by the name of Vander Albert As an ambassador or negociator of her sex could not take the usual means of intelligence of mixing with the multitude and bustling in the cabals of statesmen she fell upon another way perhaps more efficacious of working by her eyes This Vander Albert had been in love with her before her marriage with Mr Behn and no sooner heard of her arrival at Antwerp than he paid her a visit and after a repetition of his former vows and ardent professions for her service pressed her to receive from him some undeniable proofs of the vehemence and sincerity of his passsion for which he would ask no reward 'till he had by long and faithful services convinced her that he deserved it This proposal was so suitable to her present aim in the service of her country  that she accepted it and employed Albert in such a manner as made her very serviceable to the King The latter end of the year he sent her word by a special messenger that he would be with her at a day appoinced at which time he revealed to her that Cornelius de Wit who with the rest of that family had an implacable hatred to the English nation and the house of Orange had with de Ruyter proposed to the States the expedition abovementioned This proposal concurring with the advice which the Dutch spies in England had given them of the total neglect of all naval preparations was well received and was resolved to be put in execution as a thing neither dangerous nor difficult Albert having communicated a secret of this importance and with such marks of truth that she had no room to doubt of it as soon as the interview was at an end she dispatched an account of what she had discovered to England  Memoires ubi supra    But we cannot conclude Mrs Behn's gallantries at Antwerp without being a little more particular as we find her attacked by other lovers and thought she found means to preserve her innocence yet the account that she herself gives of her affairs there is both humorous and entertaining  In a letter to a friend she proceeds thus  'My other lover is about twice Albert's age nay and bulk too tho' Albert be not the most Barbary shape you have seen you must know him by the name of Van Bruin and he was introduced to me by Albert his kinsman and was obliged by him to furnish me in his absence with what money and other things I should please to command or have occasion for This old fellow had not visited me often before I began to be sensible of the influence of my eyes upon this old piece of touchwood but  he had not the confidence to tell me he loved me and modesty you know is no common fault of his countrymen He often insinuated that he knew a man of wealth an  substance though striken indeed in years and on that account not so agreeable as a younger man was passionately in love with me and desired to know whether my heart was so far engaged that his friend should not entertain any hopes I replied that I was surprized to hear a friend of Albert's making an interest in me for another and that if love were a passion I was any way sensible of it could never be for an old man and much to that purpose But all this would not do in a day or two I received this eloquent epistle from him'  Here Mrs Behn inserts a translation of Van Bruin's letter which was wrote in French and in a most ridiculous stile telling her he had often strove to reveal to her the tempests of his heart and with his own mouth scale the walls of her affections but terrified with the strength of her fortifications he concluded to make more regular approaches to attack her a  a farther distance and try first what a bombardment of letters would do whether these carcasses of love thrown into the sconces of her eyes would break into the midst of her breast beat down the outguard of her aversion and blow up the magazine of her cruelty that she might be brought to a capitulation and yield upon reasonable terms He then considers her as a goodly ship under sail for the Indies her hair is the pennants her forehead the prow her eyes the guns her nose the rudder He wishes he could once see her keel bove water and desires to be her pilot to steer thro' the Cape of GoodHope to the Indies of love  Our ingenious poetess sent him a suitable answer to this truly ridiculous and Dutchman like epistle She rallies him for setting out in so unprofitable a voyage as love and humorously reckons up the expences  of the voyage as ribbons and hoods for her pennants diamond rings lockets and pearlnecklaces for her guns of offence and defence silks holland lawn cambric c for her rigging  Mrs Behn tells us she diverted herself with Van Br  in in Albert's absence till he began to assume and grow troublesome to her by his addresses so that to rid himself of him she was forced to disclose the whole affair to Albert who was so enraged that he threatened the death of his rival but he was pacified by his mistress and content to upbraid the other for his treachery and forbid him the house but this says Mrs Behn  'produced a very ridiculous scene for my Nestorian lover would not give ground to Albert but was as high as he challenged him to sniker snee for me and a thousand things as comical in short nothing but my positive command could satisfy him and on that he promised no more to trouble me Sure as he thought himself of me he was thunderstruck when he heard me not only forbid him the house but ridicule all his addresses to his rival Albert with a countenance full of despair he went away not only from my lodgings but the next day from Antwerp unable to stay in a place where he had met so dreadful a defeat'  The authoress of her life has given us a farther account of her affairs with Vander Albert in which she contrived to preserve her honour without injuring her gratitude There was a woman at Antwerp who had often given Astraea warning of Albert's fickleness and inconstancy assuring her he never loved after enjoyment and sometimes changed even before he had that pretence of which she herself was an instance Albert having married her and deserted her on the weddingnight Our poetess took the opportunity of her acquaintance with this lady to put an honest trick upon her lover and at the same time do justice to an injured woman Accordingly she  made an appointment with Albert and contrived that the lady whose name was Catalina should meet him in her stead The plot succeeded and Catalina infinitely pleased with the advanture appointed the next night and the following till at last he discovered the cheat and resolved to gratify both his love and resentment by enjoying Astraea even against her will To this purpose he bribed an elderly gentlewoman whom Mrs Behn kept out of charity to put him to bed drest in her nightcloaths in her place when Astraea was passing the evening in a merchant's house in the town The merchant▪s son and his two daughters waited on Astraea home and to conclude the evening's mirth with a frolick the young gentleman proposed going to bed to the old woman and that they should all come in with candles and surprize them together As it was agreed so they did but no sooner was the young spark put to bed but he found himself accosted with ardour and a man's voice saying  'have I now caught thee thou malicious charmer now I'll not let thee go till thou hast done me justice for all the wrongs thou hast offered my doating love'  The rest of the company were extremely surprized to find Albert in Astraea's bed instead of the old woman and Albert no less surprized to find the young spark instead of Astraea In the conclusion the old woman was discarded and Albert's fury at his disappointment appeased by a promise from Mrs Bhen of marrying him at his arrival in England but Albert returning to Holland to make preparations for his voyage to England died of a Fever at Amsterdam  Memoirs ubi supra  From this adventure it plainly appears that the observation of a Dutchman's not being capable to love is false for both Albert and the Nestorian wooer seem to have been warm enough in their addresses  After passing some time in this manner at Antwerp she embarked at Dunkirk for England and in her passage was near being lost for the ship being driven on the coast foundered within sight of land but by the assistance of boats from the shore they were all saved and Mrs Behn arriving in London dedicated the rest of her life to pleasure and poetry Besides publishing three volumes of miscellany poems she wrote seventeen plays and some histories and novels She translated Fontenelle's History of Oracles and plurality of worlds to which last she annexed an Essay on Translation and translated Prose The Paraphrase of Oenone's Epistle to Paris in the English Translation of Ovid's Epistles is Mrs Behn's as are the celebrated Love Letters between a Nobleman and his Sister Her wit gained her the esteem of Mr Dryden Mr Southern c and at the same time the love and addresses of several gentlemen in particular one with whom she corresponded under the name of Lycida who it seems did not return her passion with equal warmth and with the earnestness and rapture she imagined her beauty had a right to command  Mrs Behn died after a long indisposition April and was buried in the cloister of WestminsterAbbey We shall beg leave to exhibit her character as we find it drawn by some of her cotemporaries and add a remark of our own  'Mr Langbain thinks her Memory will be long fresh among all lovers of dramatic poetry as having been sufficiciently eminent not only for her theatrical performances but several other pieces both in prose and verse which gained her an esteem among the wits almost equal to that of the incomparable Orinda Mrs Katherine Phillips'  There are several encomiums on Mrs Behn prefixed to her lover's watch among the rest Mr  Charles Cotton author of Virgil Travesty throws in his mite in her praise though the lines are but poorly writ But of all her admirers Mr Charles Gildon who was intimately acquainted with our poetess speaks of her with the highest encomiums  In his epistle dedicatory to her histories and novels he thus expresses himself  'Poetry the supreme pleasure of the mind is begot and born in pleasure but oppressed and killed with pain This reflexion ought to raise our admiration of Mrs Behn whose genius was of that force to maintain its gaiety in the midst of disappointments which a woman of her sense and merit ought never to have met with But she had a great strength of mind and command of thought being able to write in the midst of company and yet have the share of the conversation which I saw her do in writing Oroonoko and other parts of her works in every part of which you'll find an easy stile and a peculiar happiness of thinking The passions that of love especially she was mistress of and gave us such nice and tender touches of them that without her name we might discover the author'  To this character of Mrs Behn may be very properly added that given of her by the authoress of her life and memoirs in these words  'She was of a generous humane disposition something passionate very serviceable to her friends in all that was in her power and could sooner forgive an injury than do one She had wit humour goodnature and judgment She was mistress of all the pleasing arts of conversation She was a woman of sense and consequently a lover of pleasure For my part I knew her intimately and never saw ought unbecoming the just modesty of our sex though more gay and free than the folly of the precise will allow'  The authors of the Biographia Brittanica say that her poetry is none of the best and that her comedies tho' not without humour are full of the most indecent scenes and expressions As to the first with submission to the authority of these writers the charge is illfounded which will appear from the specimen upon which Dryden himself makes her a compliment as to the latter I'm afraid it cannot be so well defended but let those who are ready to blame her consider that her's was the sad alternative to write or starve the taste of the times was corrupt and it is a true observation that they who live to please must please to live  Mrs Behn perhaps as much as any one condemned loose scenes and too warm descriptions but something must be allowed to human frailty She herself was of an amorous complexion she felt the passions intimately which she describes and this circumstance added to necessity might be the occasion of her plays being of that cast  The stage how loosely does Astrea tread  Who fairly puts all characters to bed  Are lines of Mr Pope  And another modern speaking of the vicissitudes to which the stage is subjected has the following  Perhaps if skill could distant times explore  New Behn's new Durfey's yet remain in store  Perhaps for who can guess th' effects of chance  Here Hunt  A noted boxer  may box and Mahomet  A Turk famous for his performances on a wire after the manner of ropedancers  may dance  This author cannot be well acquainted with Mrs Behn's works who makes a comparison between them and the productions of Durfey There are marks of a fine understanding in the most unfinished piece of Mrs Behn and the very worst of this lady's compositions are preferable to Durfey's best It is unpleasing to have the merit of any of the Fair Sex lessened Mrs Behn suffered enough at the hands of supercilious prudes who had the barbarity to construe her sprightliness into lewdness and because she had wit and beauty she must likewise be charged with prostitution and irreligion  Her

celebrated play of that name who in his dedication of it speaking of his obligation to Mrs Behn for the subject says  'She had a great command of the stage and I have often wondered that she would bury her favou  ite hero in a novel when she might have revived him in the scene She thought either that no actor could represent him or she could not bear him represented and I believe the last when

is of the fair sex understood not Latin but if she does not I'm afraid she has given us occasion to be ashamed who do"  Part of this epistle transcribed will afford a specimen of her versification  Say lovely youth why wouldst thou thus betray  My easy faith and lead my heart away  I might some humble shepherd's choice have been  Had I not heard that tongue those eyes not seen  And in some homely cot in low repose  Liv'd undisturb'd with broken vows and oaths  All day by shaded springs my flocks have kept  And in some honest arms at night have slept  Then unupbraided with my wrongs thou'dst been  Sase in the joys of the fair Grecian queen  What stars do rule the great no sooner you  Became a prince but you were perju  ed too  Are crowns and falshoods then consistent things  And must they all be faithless who are Kings  The gods be prais'd that I was humble born  Ev'n tho' it renders me my Paris' scorn  And I had rather this way wretched prove  Than be a queen dishonest in my love  Sir GEORGE ETHEREGF  A Celebrated wit in the reign of Charles and James II He is said to have been descended of an ancient family of Oxfordshire and born about the year it is thought he had some part of his education at the university of Cambridge but in his younger years he travelled into France and consequently made no long stay at the university Upon his return he for some time studied the Municipal Law at one of the Inns of Court in which it seems he made but little progress and like other men of sprightly genius abandoned it for pleasure and the gayer accomplishments  In the year the town was obliged with his first performance for the stage entitled the Comical Revenge or Love in a Tub the writing whereof brought him acquainted as he himself informed us with the earl of Dorset to whom it is by the author dedicated The fame of this play together with his easy unreserved conversation and happy address rendered him a favourite with the leading wits such as the duke of Buckingham Sir Charles Sedley the earl of Rochester Sir Car Scroop Being animated by this encouragement in he brought another comedy upon the stage entitled She Would if She Could which gained him no less applause and it was expected that by the continuance of his studies he would polish  and enliven the theatrical taste and be no less constant in such entertainments than the most assiduous of his cotemporaries but he was too much addicted to pleasure and being impelled by no necessity he neglected the stage and never writ 'till he was forced to it by the importunity of his friends In his last comedy called the Man of Mode or Sir Fopling Flutter came on the stage with the most extravagant success he was then a servant to the beautiful duchess of York of whom Dryden has this very singularexpression  'that he does not think that at the general resurrection she can be made to look more charming than now'  Sir George dedicates this play to his Royal Mistress with the most courtly turns of compliment In this play he is said to have drawn or to use the modern cant taken off some of the contemporary coxcombs and Mr Dryden in an Epilogue to it has endeavoured to remove the suspicion of personal satire and says that the character of Flutter is meant to ridicule none in particular but the whole fraternity of finished fops the idolaters of new fashions  His words are  True fops help nature's work and go to school  To file and finish God Almighty's fool  Yet none Sir Fopling him or him can call  He's Knight o'th' Shire and represents you all  But this industry to avoid the imputation of personal satire but served to heighten it and the town soon found out originals to his characters Sir Fopling was said to be drawn for one Hewit a beau of those times who it seems was such a creature as the poet ridiculed but who perhaps like many other coxcombs would never have been  remembered but for this circumstance which transmits his memory to posterity  The character of Dorimant was supposed to represent the earl of Rochester who was inconstant faithless and undetermined in his amours and it is likewise said in the character of Medley that the poet has drawn out some sketch of himself and from the authority of Mr Bowman who played Sir Fopling or some other part in this comedy it is said that the very Shoemaker in Act I was also meant for a real person who by his improvident courses before having been unable to make any profit by his trade grew afterwards upon the public exhibition of him so industrious and notable that he drew a crowd of the best customers to him and became a very thriving tradesman Whether the poet meant to display these characters we cannot now determine but it is certain the town's ascribing them to some particular persons was paying him a very high compliment and if it proved no more it at least demonstrated a close imitation of nature a beauty which constitutes the greatest perfection of a comic poet  Our author it seems was addicted to some gay extravagances such as gaming and an unlicensed indulgence in women and wine which brought some satirical reflexions upon him Gildon in his Lives of the Dramatic Poets says that upon marrying a fortune he was knighted the circumstances of it are these He had by his gaming and extravagance so embarrassed his affairs that he courted a rich widow in order to retrieve them but she being an ambitious woman would not condescend to marry him unless he could make her a lady which he was obliged to do by the purchase of a knighthood and this appears in a Consolatary Epistle to captain Julian from the duke of Buckingham in which this match is reflected on We have no account  of any issue he had by this lady but from the information of Mr Bowman we can say that he cohabited for some time with the celebrated Mrs Barry the actress and had one daughter by her that he settled or l on her but that she died young  From the same intelligence it also appears that Sir George was in his person a fair  Biogr Brit p  slender genteel man but spoiled his countenance with d  inking and other habits of intemperance In his deportment he was very affable and courteous of a generous disposition which with his free lively and natural vein of writing acquired him the general character of gentle George and easy Etherege in respect of which qualities we often find him compared to Sir Charles Sedley His courtly and easy behaviour so recommended him to the Duchess of York that when on the accession of King James II she became Queen she sent him ambassador abroad Gildon says to Hamburgh but it is pretty evident that he was in that reign a minister at Ratisbon at least from the year to the time his majesty left this kingdom if not later but it appears that he was there by his own letters wrote from thence to the earl of Middleton  After this last comedy we meet with no more he ever wrote for the stage however there are preserved some letters of his in prose publ  shed among a collection of Familiar Letters by John earl of Rochester two of which sent to the duke of Buckingham have particular merit both for the archness of the turns and the acuteness of the observation He gives his lordship a humorous description of some of the Germans their excessive drunkenness their plodding stupidity and offensive indelicacy he complains that he has no companion  in that part of the world no Sir Charles Sedleys nor Buckinghams and what is still worse even deprived of the happiness of a mistress for the women there he says are so coy and so narrowly watched by their relations that there is no possibility of accomplishing an intrigue He mentions however one Monsieur Hoffman who married a French lady with whom he was very great and after the calamitous accident of Mr Hoffman's being drowned he pleasantly describes the grief of the widow and the methods he took of removing her sorrow by an attempt in which he succeeded These two letters discover the true character of Etherege as well as of the noble person to whom they were sent and mark them as great libertines in speculation as in practice  As for the other compositions of our author they consist chiefly of little airy sonnets smart lampoons and smooth panegyrics All that we have met with more than is here mentioned of his writing in prose is a short piece entitled An Account of the Rejoicing at the Diet of Ratisbon performed by Sir George Etherege Knight residing there from his Majesty of Great Britain upon Occasion of the Birth of the Prince of Wales in a Letter from himself printed in the Savoy When our author died the writers of his life have been very deficient Gildon says that after the Revolution he followed his master into France and died there or very soon after his arrival in England from thence But there was a report say the authors of the Biograph Brit which they received from an ingenious gentleman  'that Sir George came to an untimely death by an unlucky accident at Ratisbon for after having treated some company with a liberal entertainment at his house there when he had taken  his glass too freely and being through his great complaisance too forward in waiting on his guests at their departure flushed as he was he tumbled down stairs and broke his neck and so fell a martyr to jollity and civility'  One of the earliest of our author's lesser poems is that addressed to her Grace the Marchioness of Newcastle after reading her poems and as it is esteemed a very elegant panegyric we shall give the conclusion of it as a specimen  While we your praise endeavouring to rehearse  Pay that great duty in our humble verse  Such as may justly move your anger now  Like Heaven forgive them and accept them too  But what we cannot your brave hero pays  He builds those monuments we strive to raise  Such as to after ages shall make known  While he records your deathless fame his own  So when an artist some rare beauty draws  Both in our wonder there and our applause  His skill from time secures the glorious dame  And makes himself immortal in her fame  Besides his Songs little panegyrical Poems and Sonnets he wrote two Satires against Nell Gwyn one of the King's mistresses though there is no account how a quarrel happened between them the one is called Madam Nelly's Complaint beginning  If Sylla's ghost made bloody Cat'line start  The other is called the Lady of Pleasure with its Argument at the Head of it whereof the first line is  The life of Nelly truly shewn  Sir George spent a life of ease pleasure and affluence at least never was long nor much exposed to want He seems to have possessed a sprightly genius to have had an excellent turn for comedy and very happy in a courtly dialogue We have no proof of his being a scholar and was rather born than made a poet He has not escaped the censure of the critics for his works are so extremely loose and licentious as to render them dangerous to young unguarded minds and on this account our witty author is indeed justly liable to the severest censure of the virtuous and sober part of mankind  WILLIAM MOUNTFORD  THIS gentleman who was very much distinguished as a player was born in the year but of what family we have no account farther than that they were of Staffordshire the extraordinary circumstances of Mr Mountford's death have drawn more attention upon him than he might otherwise have had and though he was not very considerable as a poet yet he was of great eminence as an actor Mr Cibber in his Apology for his own Life has mentioned him with the greatest respect and drawn his character with strong touches of admiration After having delineated the theatrical excellences of Kynaston Sandford c he thus speaks of Mountford  'Of person he was tall well made fair and of an agreeable aspect his voice clear full and melodious in tragedy he was the most affecting lover within my memory his addresses had a resistless recommendation from the very tone of his voice which gave his words such softness that as Dryden says'  ' Like flakes of feather'd snow  ' They melted as they fell  'All this he particularly verified in that scene of Alexander where the hero throws himself at the feet of Statira for pardon of his past infidelities There we saw the great the tender the penitent  the despairing the transported and the amiable in the highest perfection In comedy he gave the truest life to what we call the fine gentleman his spirit shone the brighter for being polished by decency In scenes of gaiety he never broke into the regard that was due to the presence of equal or superior characters tho' inferior actors played them he filled the stage not by elbowing and crossing it before others or disconcerting their action but by surpassing them in true and masterly touches of nature he never laughed at his own jest unless the point of his raillery upon another required it he had a particular talent in giving life to bons mots and repartees the wit of the poet seemed always to come from him extempore and sharpened into more wit from his brilliant manner of delivering it he had himself a good share of it or what is equal to it so lively a pleasantness of humour that when either of these fell into his hands upon the stage he wantoned with them to the highest delight of his auditors The agreeable was so natural to him that even in that dissolute character of the Rover he seemed to wash off the guilt from vice and gave it charms and merit for though it may be a reproach to the poet to draw such characters not only unpunished but rewarded the actor may still be allowed his d  e praise in his excellent performance and this was a distinction which when this comedy was acted at Whitehall King William's Queen Mary was pleased to make in favour of Mountford notwithstanding her disapprobation of the play which was heightened by the consideration of its having been written by a lady viz Mrs Behn from whom more modesty might have been expected'  'He had besides all this a variety in his genius which few capital actors have shewn or perhaps have thought it any addition of their merit  to arrive at he could entirely change himself could at once throw off the man of sense for the brisk vain rude lively coxcomb the false flashy pretender to wit and the dupe of his own sufficiency of this he gave a delightful instance in the character of Sparkish in Wycherley's Country Wife in that of Sir Courtly Nice by Crown his excellence was still greater there his whole man voice mien and gesture was no longer Mountford but another person there the insipid soft civility the elega  t and formal mien the drawling delicacy of voice the stately flatness of his address and the empty eminence of his attitudes were so nicely observed that had he not been an entire master of nature had he not kept his judgment as it were a centinel upon himself not to admit the least likeness of what he used to be to enter into any part of his performance he could not possibly have so compleatly finished it'  Mr Cibber further observes that if some years after the death of Mountford he himself had any success in those parts he acknowledges the advantages he had received from the just idea and strong impressions from Mountford's acting them  'Had he been remembered says he when I first attempted them my defects would have been more easily discovered and consequently my favourable reception in them must have been very much and justly abated If it could be remembered how much he had the advantage of me in voice and person I could not here be suspected of an affected modesty or overvaluing his excellence for he sung a clear countertenor and had a melodious warbling throat which could not but set off the  ast scene of Sir Courtly with uncommon happiness which I alas could only struggle through with the faint excuses and real confidence of a fine singer under the imperfection of a feigned and sc  eaming treble  which at least could only shew you what I would have done had nature been more favourable to me'  This is the amiable representation which Mr Cibber makes of his old favourite and whose judgment in theatrical excellences has been ever indisputed But this finished performer did not live to reap the advantages which would have arisen from the great figure he made upon the stage  He fell in the d year of his age by the hand of an asiassin who cowardly murdered him and fled from justice As we imagine it will not be unpleasing to the reader to be made acquainted with the most material circumstances relating to that affair we shall here insert them as they appear on the trial of lord Mohun who was arraigned for that murder and acquitted by his peers Lord Mohun it is well known was a man of loose morals a rancorous spirit and in short reflected no honour on his titles It is a true observation that the temper and disposition of a man may be more accurately known by the company he keeps than by any other means of reading the human heart Lord Mohun had contracted a great intimacy with one captain Hill a man of scandalous morals and despicable life and was so fond of this fellow whom it seems nature had wonderfully formed to be a cutthroat that he entered into his schemes and became a party in promoting his most criminal pleasures  This murderer had long entertained a passion sor Mrs Bracegirdle so well known as an excellent actress and who died not many years ago that it would be superfluous to give a particular account of her his passion was rejected with disdain by Mrs Bracegirdle who did not think such a heart as his worth possessing The contempt with which she used captain  Hill fired his resentment he valued himself for being a gentleman and an officer in the army and thought he had a right at the first onset to triumph over the heart of an actress but in this he found himself miserably mistaken Hill who could not bear the contempt shewn him by Mrs Bracegirdle conceived that her aversion must proceed from having previously engaged her heart to some more favoured lover and though Mr Mountford was a married man he became j  a+lous of him probably from no other reason than the respect with which he observed Mr Mountford treat her and their frequently playing together in the same scene Confirmed in this suspicion he resolved to be revenged on Mountford and as he could not possess Mrs Bracegirdle by gentle means he determined to have recourse to violence and hired some ruffians to assist him in carrying her off His chief accomplice in this scheme was lord Mohun to whom he communicated his intention and who concurred with him in it They appointed an evening for that purpose hired a number of soldiers and a coach and went to the playhouse in order to find Mrs Bracegirdle but she having no part in the play of that night did not come to the house They then got intelligence that she was gone with her mother to sup at one Mrs Page's in DruryLane thither they went and fixed their post in expectation of Mrs Bracegirdle's coming out when they intended to have executed their scheme against her She at last came out accompanied with her mother and Mr Page the two adventurers made a sign to their hired bravo's who laid their hands on Mrs Bracegirdle but her mother who threw her arms round her waist preventing them from thrusting her immediately into the coach and Mr Page gaining time to call assistance their attempt was  frustrated and Mrs Bracegirdle her mother and Mr Page were safely conveyed to her own house in Howardstreet in the Strand Lord Mohun and Hill enraged at this disappointment resolved since they were unsuccessful in one part of their design they would yet attempt another and that night vowed revenge against Mr Mountford  They went to the street where Mr Mountford lived and there lay in wait for him Old Mrs Bracegirdle and another gentlewoman who had heard them vow revenge against Mr Mountford sent to his house to desire his wife to let him know his danger and to warn him not to come home that night but unluckily no messenger Mrs Mountford sent was able to find him Captain Hill and lord Mohun paraded in the streets with their swords drawn and when the watch made enquiry into the cause of this lord Mohun answered that he was a peer of the realm and dared them to touch him at their peril the nightofficers being intimidated at this threat left them unmolested and went their rounds Towards midnight Mr Mountford going home to his own house was saluted in a very friendly manner by lord Mohun and as his lordship seemed to cary no marks of resentment in his behaviour he used the freedom to ask him how he came there at that time of night to which his lordship replied by asking if he had not heard the affair of the woman Mountford asked what woman to which he answered Mrs Bracegirdle I hope says he my lord you do not encourage Mr Hill in his attempt upon Mrs Bracegirdle which however is no concern of mine when he uttered these words Hill behind his back gave him some desperate blows on his head and before Mr Mountford had time to draw and stand on his defence he basely run him thro' the body and made his escape the alarm of murder being given the constable seized lord Mohun who upon hearing that Hill had escaped  expressed great satisfaction and said he did not care if he were hanged for him When the evidences were examined at Hick'sHall one Mr Bencroft who attended Mr Mountford swore that Mr Mountford declared to him as a dying man that while he was talking to lord Mohun Hill struck him with his left hand and with his right hand run him thro' the body before he had time to draw his sword  Thus fell the unfortunate Mountford by the hand of an assassin without having given him any provocation save that which his own jealousy had raised and which could not reasonably be imputed to Mountford as a crime  Lord Mohun as we have already observed was tried and acquitted by his peers as it did not appear that he immediately assisted Hill in perpetrating the murder or that they had concerted it before for tho' they were heard to vow revenge against Mountford the word murther was never mentioned It seems abundantly clear that lord Mohun however if not active was yet accessary to the murther and had his crime been high treason half the evidence which appeared against him might have been sufficient to cost him his head This nobleman himself was killed at last in a duel with the duke of Hamilton  The foundation of the quarrel between lord Mohun and the duke however it might be improved by party suggestions was a law suit between these noblemen on account of part of the earl of Macclesfield's estate which Mr Savage would have been heir to had not his mother to facilitate her designed divorce from that earl with the pleasing view of having her large fortune restored to her and the no less pleasing prospect of being freed from an uncomfortable husband declared unhappy Savage to be illegitimate and natural son of the then earl Rivers Of this farther notice will be taken in Savage's Life    Mr Mountford besides his extraordinary talents as an actor is author of the following dramatic pieces  The Injured Lovers or the Ambitious Father a Tragedy acted at the TheatreRoyal dedicated to James earl of Arran son to the duke of Hamilton  The Successful Strangers a TragiComedy acted at the TheatreRoyal dedicated to lord Wharton The plot is taken from the Rival Brothers in Scarron's Novels  GreenwichPark a Comedy acted at the TheatreRoyal dedicated to Algernon earl of Essex  Besides these he turned the Life and Death of Dr Faustus into a Farce with the Humours of Harlequin and Scaramouch acted at the queen's theatre in DorsetGarden and revived at the Theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields  Mr Mountford has written many Prologues and Epilogues scattered in Dryden's Miscellanies and likewise several Songs He seems to have had a sprightly genius and possessed a pleasing gaiety of humourHe was killed in the year and was buried in St Clement Danes  THOMAS SHADWELL  THIS celebrated poetlaureat was descended of a very antient family in Staffordshire the eldest branch of which has enjoyed an estate there of fivehundred pounds per ann He was born about the year at StantonHall in Norfolk a seat of his father's and educated at Caius College in Cambridge  General Dictionary See the article Shadwell  where his father had been likewise bred and then placed in the middle Temple to study the law where having spent some time he travelled abroad Upon his return home he became acquainted with the most celebrated persons of wit and distinguished quality in that age which was so much addicted to poetry and polite literature that it was not easy for him who had no doubt a native relish for the same accomplishments to abstain from these the fashionable studies and amusements of those times He applied himself chiefly to the dramatic kind of writing in which he had considerable success At the revolution Mr Dryden who had so warmly espoused the opposite interest was dispossessed of his place of Poet Laureat and Mr Shadwell succeeded him in it which employment he possessed till his death Mr Shadwell has been illustrious for nothing so much as the quarrel which subsisted between him and Dryden who held him in the greatest contempt We cannot discover what was the cause of Mr Dryden's aversion to Shadwell or how this quarrel began unless it was  occasioned by the vacant Laurel being bestowed on Mr Shadwell But it is certain the former prosecuted his resentment severely and in his Mac Flecknoe has transmitted his antagonist to posterity in no advantageous light It is the nature of satire to be biting but it is not always its nature to be true We cannot help thinking that Mr Dryden has treated Shadwell a little too unmercifully and has violated truth to make the satire more pungent He says in the piece abovementioned  Others to some faint meaning make pretence  But Shadwell never deviates into sense  Which is not strictly true There are high authorities in favour of many of his Comedies and the best wits of the age gave their testimony for them They have in them fine strokes of humour the characters are often original strongly mark'd and well sustained add to this that he had the greatest expedition in writing imaginable and sometimes produced a play in less than a month Shadwell as it appears from Rochester's Session of the Poets was a great favourite with Otway and as they lived in intimacy together it might perhaps be the occasion of Dryden's expressing so much contempt for Otway which his cooler judgment could never have directed him to do  Mr Shadwell died the th of December in the fiftysecond year of his age as we are informed by the inscription upon his monument in Westminster Abbey tho' there may be some mistake in that date for it is said in the title page of his funeral sermon preached by Dr Nicholas Brady that he was interred at Chelsea on the th of November that year This sermon was published in quarto and in it Dr Brady tells us  'That our author was a man of great honesty and integrity an inviolable  fidelity and strictness in his word an unalterable friendship wherever he professed it and however the world may be mistaken in him he had a much deeper sense of religion than many who pretended more to it His natural and acquired abilities continues the Dr made him very amiable to all who knew and conversed with him a very few being equal in the becoming qualities which adorn and set off a complete gentleman his very enemies if he have now any left will give him this character at least if they knew him so thoroughly as I didHis death seized him suddenly but he could not be unprepared since to my certain knowledge he never took a dose of opium but he solemnly recommended himself to God by prayer'  When some persons urged to the then lord chamberlain that there were authors who had better pretensions to the Laurel his lordship replied  'He did not pretend to say how great a poet Shadwell might be but was sure he was an honest man'  Besides his dramatic works he wrote several other pieces of poetry the chief of which are his congratulatory poem on the Prince of Orange's coming to England another on queen Mary his translation of the th Satire of Juvenal c Shadwell in his Comedies imitated Ben Johnson and proposed him as his model of excellence with what degree of success we shall not take upon us to determine but proceed to give an account of his plays  The Sullen Lovers or the Impertinent a Comedy acted at the duke's theatre dedicated to William duke of Newcastle the dedication is dated September st  The Humorist a Comedy acted by his royal  ghness's servants dedicated to Margaret duchess of Newcastle  The Royal Shepherdess a TragiComedy acted by the duke of York's servants printed at London in quarto This play was originally written by Mr Fountain of Devonshire but altered throughout by Mr Shadwell  The Virtuoso a Comedy acted at the duke's theatre printed at London in quarto dedicated to the duke of Newcastle  Mr Langbaine observes that no body will deny this play its due applause at least I know says he that the university of Oxford who may be allowed competent judges of comedy especially such characters as Sir Nicholas Gimcrack and Sir Formal Trifle applauded it And as no man ever undertook to discover the frailties of such pretenders to this kind of knowledge before Mr Shadwell so none since Johnson's time ever drew so many different characters of humour and with such success  Pysche a Tragedy acted at the duke's theatre printed in London in to and dedicated to the duke of Monmouth In the preface he tell us that this play was written in five weeks  The Libertine a Tragedy acted by his royal highness's servants printed in London in quarto and dedicated to the duke of Newcastle In the preface Mr Shadwell observes that the story from which he took the hint of this play is famous all over Spain Italy and France It was first used in a Spanish play the Spaniards having a tradition of such a vicious Spaniard as is represented in this play from them the Italian comedians took it the French borrowed it from them and four several plays have been made upon the story  Epsom Wells a comedy acted at the duke's theatre printed at London in to and dedicated to the duke of Newcastle Mr Langbaine says that this is so diverting and so true a comedy that even foreigners who are not in general kind to the wit of our nation have extremely commended it  The History of Timon of Athens the Manhater acted at the duke's theatre printed at London in to In the dedication to George duke of Buckingham he observes that this play was originally Shakespear's who never made says he more masterly strokes than in this yet I can truly say I have made it into a play  The Miser a Comedy acted at the theatreroyal dedicated to the earl of Dorset In the preface our author observes he took the foundation of it from Moliere's L'Avare  A true Widow a Comedy acted at the duke's theatre printed in in to dedicated to Sir Charles Sidley The prologue was written by Mr Dryden for at this time they lived in friendship  The Lancashire Witches and Teague O Divelly the Irish priest a comedy acted at the duke's theatre printed at London Our author has a long preface to this play in which he vindicates his piece from the charge of reflecting upon the church and the sacred order He apologizes for the magical part and observes that he had no hopes of equaling Shakespear in his fancy who created his Witches for the most part out of his imagination in which faculty no man ever excelled  him and therefore says he I resolve to take mine from authority  The Woman Captain a Comedy acted by his royal highness's servants  The Squire of Alsatia a Comedy acted by his Majesty's servants printed at London in to and dedicated to the earl of Dorset and Middlesex  BuryFair a Comedy acted by his Majesty's servants printed at London in to and dedicated to the earl of Dorset In the dedication he observes  'That this play was written during eight months painful sickness wherein all the several days in which he was able to write any part of a scene amounted not to one month except some few which were employed in indispensible business'  Amorous Bigot with the second part of Teague O Divelly a Comedy acted by their Majesties servants printed in to dedicated to Charles earl of Shrewsbury  The Scowerers a Comedy acted by their Majesties servants and printed in to  The Volunteers or the StockJobbers a Comedy acted by their Majesties servants dedicated to the Queen by Mrs Anne Shadwell our author's widow  In the epilogue the character of Mr Shadwell who was then dead was given in the following lines  Shadwell the great support o'th'comic stage  Born to expose the sollies of the age  To whip prevailing vices and unite  Mirth with instruction profit with delight  For large ideas and a flowing pen  First of our times and second but to Ben  Whose mighty genius and discerning mind  Trac'd all the various humours of mankind  Dressing them up with such successful care  That ev'ry fop sound his own picture there  And blush'd for shame at the surprising skill  Which made his lov'd resemblance look so ill  Shadwell who all his lines from nature drew  Copy'd her out and kept her still in view  Who never sunk in prose nor soar'd in verse  So high as bombast or so low as farce  Who ne'er was brib'd by title or estate  To fawn or flatter with the rich or great  To let a gilded vice or solly pass  But always lash'd the villain and the ass  Sir WILLIAM KILLEGREW  THE eldest son of Sir Robert Killegrew Knt chamberlain to the Queen was born at the Manor of Hanworth near HamptonCourt in the month of May He became a gentleman commoner in St John's College in Midsummer term where continuing about three years he travelled beyond seas and after his return was made governor of Pendennis castle and of Falmouth haven in Cornwall with command of the militia in the west part of that county After this he was called to attend King Charles I as one of the gentlemen ushers of his privy chamber in which employment he continued till the breaking out of the great rebellion and had the command given him of one of the two great troops of horse that guarded the King's person during the whole course of the was between his Majesty and his Parliament Our author was in attendance upon the King when the court resided at Oxford and was created doctor of the civil laws  Wood Athen Oxon vol  and upon the run  of the King's affairs he suffered for his attachment to him and compounded with the republicans for his estate  Upon the restoration of King Charles II he was the first of his father's servants that he took any notice of and made him gentlemanusher of his privy chamber the same place he enjoyed under the deceased King Upon Charles IId's marriage with Donna Catherina of Portugal he was created his Majesty's first vice chamberlain in which honourable station he continued twentytwo years  His dramatic works are  Ormasdes or Love and friendship a tragicomedy  Pandora or the Converts a Comedy  Siege of Urbin a TragiComedy  Selindra a TragiComedy  All these plays were printed together in folio Oxon There is another play ascribed to our author called the Imperial Tragedy printed in the chief part was taken out of a Latin play and much altered by him for his own diversion tho' upon the importunity of his friends he was prevailed upon to publish it but without his name The plot is founded upon the history of Zeno the th emperor of Constantinople after Constantine Sir William Killegrew's plays have been applauded by men very eminent in poetry particucularly Mr Waller who addresses a copy of verses to him upon his altering Pandora from a tragedy into a comedy because not approved on the stage  Sir William has also a little poem extant which was set to music by Mr Henry Lawes a man in the highest reputation of any of his profession in his time Mr Wood says that after our author had retired from court in his declining age he wrote  The Artless Midnight Thoughts of a Gentleman at Court who for many years built on sand which every blast of cross fortune has defaced but now he has laid new foundations on the rock of his salvation c London It is dedicated to King Charles II and besides thoughts in it there are some small pieces of poetry  Midnight and Daily thoughts in verse and prose Lond with commendatory verses before it by H Briket He died and was buried in Westminster Abbey  Sir ROBERT HOWARD  THIS gentleman was a younger son of Thomas earl of Berkshire by Elizabeth his wife one of the daughters and coheirs of William lord Burghley and received his education at Magdalencollege Oxford under the tuition of Dr E Drope During the civil wars he suffered with the rest of his family who maintained their loyalty to the unfortunate King Charles I Upon the restoration our author was made a knight and was chosen one of the burgesses for Stockbridge in Hampshire to serve in the Parliament which began at Westminster th of May he was quickly preferred to the place of auditor of the Exchequer then worth some thousand pounds per annum and was reckoned one of King Charles's creatures whom he advanced on account of his faithful services in cajoling the Parliament for Money  In the year he was chosen burgess for Castlerising in Norfolk to serve in that Parliament which began at Westminster on the th of October When the revolution was effected and King William ascended the throne he was elected burgess again for Castlerising to sit in the Parliament which began the d of January was made one of the privy council about the th of February took the usual oaths and commenced from that moment a violent persecutor of the Nonjurors  and disclaimed all manner of conversation and inter course with any of that character He is said to have been a man extremely positive and a pretender to a more general understanding than he really possessed His obstinacy and pride procured him many enemies amongst whom the  ke of Buckingham was the first who intended to have exposed Sir Robert under the name of Bilboa in the Rehearsal but the plague which then prevailed occasioned the theatres to be shut up and the people of fashion to quit the town In this int  eval he altered his resolution and levelled his  d  cale at a much greater name under that of Bayes  Thomas Shadwell the poet tho' a man of the same principles with Sir Robert concerning the revolution and state matters was yet so angry with the knight for his supercilious domineering manner of behaving that he points him out under the name of Sir Positive At All one of his cha  cters in the comedy called the Sullen Lovers or the Impertinents and amongst the same per  ons is the lady Vain a Courtezan which the wits then understood to be the mistress of Sir Robert Howard whom he afterwards thought proper to marry  In February being then in the decline of life he married one Mrs Dives maid of honour to the Queen The merit of this author seems to have been of a low rate for very little is preserved concerning him and none of his works are now read nor is he ever mentioned but when that circumstance of the duke of Buckingham's intending to ridicule him is talked of  Had Sir Robert been a man of any parts he had sufficient advantages from his birth and fortune to have made a figure but the highest notice which he can claim in the republic of letters is that he was brother in law to Dryden  His works are  Poems containing a panegyric on the King and songs and sonnets Lond and a panegyric on general Monk  His plays are six in number viz  The Blind Lady a Comedy  The Committee or the Faithful Irishman a Comedy printed folio London This comedy is often acted and the success of it chiefly depends upon the part of Teague being well performed  The Great Favourite or the Duke of Lerma a TragiComedy acted at the threatreroyal This play was criticised by Mr Dryden  The Indian Queen a Tragedy  Surprizal a Tragicomedy acted at the theatreroyal  The Vestal Virgin or the Roman Ladies a Tragedy In his prologue to this play Sir Robert has the following couplet meant as an answer to Dryden's animadversions on the Duke of Lerma  This doth a wretched dearth of wit betray  When things of kind on one another prey  He has written likewise  The History of the Reigns of Edward and Richard II with Reflections and Characters on their chief ministers and favourites As also a comparison between these princes Edward and Richard II with Edward I and Edward III London printed  A Letter to Mr Samuel Johnson occasioned by a scurrilous pamphlet entitled Amimadversions on Mr Johnson's Answer to Jovian in three Letters to a country friend Lond At the end of this letter is reprinted the preface before the history of the reigns of Edward and Richard II before mentioned  The History of Religion Lond  The th book of Virgil translated into English which contains the loves of Dido and Aeneas  Likewise P Papinius Statius his Achilles in five books to each of which he has subjoined Annotations  RICHARD FLECKNOE  THIS poet lived in the reign of King Charles II and is more remarkable for having given name to a satire of Mr Dryden's than for all his own works He is said to have been originally a jesuit and to have had connexions in consequence thereof with such persons of distinction in London as were of the Roman Catholic persuasion Langbaine says his acquaintance with the nobility was more than with the muses and he had a greater propensity to rhiming than genius to poetry  Tho' he wrote several plays yet he never could obtain the favour to have more than one of them acted  His dramatic works are  Damoiselles alamode a Comedy printed vo Lond and addressed to the duke and duchess of Newcastle This comedy was designed by the author to have been acted by his Majesty's servants which they thought proper however to refuse we know not for what reasonThe poet indeed has assigned one whether true or false is immaterial but it may serve to shew his humour  'For the acting this comedy says he those who have the government of the stage have their humours and would be intreated and I have mine and won't entreat them and were all dramatic  writers of my mind they should wear their old plays threadbare er'e they should have any new till they better understood their own interest and how to distinguish between good and bad'  This anger of Mr Flecknoe's at the players for refusing the piece bears some resemblance to that of Bayes when the players went to dinner without his leave  'How are the players gone to dinner If they are I will make them know what it is to injure a person who does them the honour to write for them and all that a company of proud conceited humorous crossgrain'd persons and all that I'll make them the most contemptible despicable in considerable persons and all that' c c c  Ermina or the chaste lady printed in octavo London  Love's Dominion a dramatic piece which the author says is full of excellent morality and is written as a pattern of the reformed stage printed in octavo London and dedicated to the lady Elizabeth Claypole In this epistle the author insinuates the use of plays and begs her mediation to gain license to act them  Love's Kingdom a TragiComedy not as it was acted at the theatre in Lincoln'sInn but as it was written and since corrected printed in octavo London and dedicated to his excellency William lord marquis of Newcastle This is no more than the former play a little alter'd with a new title and after the king's return it seems the poet obtained leave to have it acted but it had the misfortune to be damned by the audience which Mr Flecknoe stiles the people and calls them judges without judgment for want of its being rightly represented to them he owns it wants much of the ornaments of the stage but that he says by a lively imagination may be easily supplied  'To the same purpose he speaks of his Damoiselles à la Mode  That together with the persons represented he had set down the comedians he had designed should represent them that the reader might have half the pleasure of seeing it acted and a lively imagination might have the pleasure of it all entire'  The Marriage of Oceanus and Britannia a Masque  Our author's other works consist of Epigrams and Enigmas There is a book of his writing called the Diarium or the Journal divided into twelve jornadas in burlesque verse  Dryden in two lines in his Mac Flecknoe gives the character of our author's works  In prose and verse was own'd without dispute  Thro' all the realms of nonsense absolute  We cannot be certain in what year Mr Flecknoe died Dryden's satire had perhaps rendered him so contemptible that none gave themselves the tro  ble to record any particulars of his life or to take any notice of his death  JOHN DRYDEN  Esq  THIS illustrious Poet was son of Erasmus Dryden of  ickermish in Northamptonshire and born at Aldwincle near Oundle  Athen Oxon  he had his education in grammar learning at Westminsterschool under the famous Dr Busby and was from thence elected in a scholar of TrinityCollege in Cambridge  We have no account of any extraordinary indications of genius given by this great poet while in his earlier days and he is one instance how little regard is to be paid to the figure a boy makes at school Mr Dryden was turned of thirty before he introduced any play upon the stage and his first called the Wild Gallants met with a very indifferent reception so that if he had not been impelled by the force of genius and propension he had never again attempted the stage a circumstance which the lovers of dramatic poetry must ever have regretted as they would in this case have been deprived of one of the grea  est ornaments that ever adorned the  rofession  The year before he left the university he wrote a poem on the death of lo  d Hastings a performance say some of his critics very unworthy of himself and of the astonishing genius he afterwards discovered  That Mr Dryden had at this time no fixed principles either in religion or politics is abundantly evident from his heroic stanza's on Oliver Cromwel written after his funeral and immediately upon the restoration he published Astraea Redux a poem on the happy restoration of Charles the IId and the same year his Panegyric to the king on his coronation In the former of these pieces a remarkable distich has expos'd our poet to the ridicule of the wits  An horrid stillness first invades the ear  And in that silence we the tempest hear  Which it must be owned is downright nonsense and a contradiction in terms Amongst others captain Radcliff has ridiculed this blunder in the following lines of his News from Hell  Laureat who was both learn'd and florid  Was damn'd long since for silence horrid  Nor had there been such clutter made  But that his silence did invade  Invade and so it might that's clear  But what did it invade An ear  In he addressed a poem to the lord chancellor Hyde presented on newyear'sday and the same year published a satire on the Dutch His next piece was his Annus Mirabilis or the Year of Wonders an historical poem which celebrated the duke of York's victory over the Dutch In the same year Mr Dryden succeeded Sir William Davenant as Poet Laureat and was also made historiographer to his majesty and that year published his Essay on Dramatic Poetry addressed to Charles earl of Dorset and Middlesex Mr Dryden tells his patron that the writing  this Essay served as an amusement to him in the country when he was driven from town by the violence of the plague which then raged in London and he diverted himself with thinking on the theatres as lovers do by ruminating on their absent mistresses He there justifies the method of writing plays in verse but confesses that he has quitted the practice because he found it troublesome and flow  He might have added 'twas unnatural  In the preface we are informed that the drift of this discourse was to vindicate the honour of the English writers from the censure of those who unjustly prefer the French to them Langbaine has injuriously treated Mr Dryden on account of his dramatic performances and charges him as a licentious plagiary The truth is our author as a dramatist is less eminent than in any other sphere of poetry but with all his faults he is even in that respect the most eminent of his time  The critics have remarked that as to tragedy he seldom touches the passions but deals rather in pompous language poetical flights and descriptions and too frequently makes his characters speak better than they have occasion or ought to do when their sphere in the drama is considered And it is peculiar to Dryden says Mr Addison to make his personages as wise witty elegant and polite as himself That he could not so intimately affect the tender passions is certain for we find no play of his in which we are much disposed to weep and we are so often inchanted with beautiful descriptions and noble flights of fancy that we forget the business of the play and are only attentive to the poet while the characters sleep Mr Gildon observes in his laws of poetry that when it was recommended to Mr Dryden to turn his thoughts to  a translation of Euripides rather than of Homer he confessed that he had no relish for that poet who was a great master of tragic simplicity Mr Gildon further observes as a confirmation that Dryden's taste for tragedy was not of the genuine sort that he constantly expressed great contempt for Otway who is universally allowed to have succeeded very happily in affecting the tender passions Yet Mr Dryden in his preface to the translation of M Du Fresnoy speaks more favourably of Otway and after mentioning these instances Gildon ascribes this taste in Dryden to his having read many French RomancesThe truth is if a poet would affect the heart he must not exceed nature too much nor colour too high distressful circumstances short speeches and pathetic observations never fail to move infinitely beyond the highest rant or long declamations in tragedy The simplicity of the drama was Otway's peculiar excellence a living poet observes that from Otway to our own times  From bard to bard the frigid caution crept  And declamation roar'd while passion slept  Mr Dryden seems to be sensible that he was not born to write comedy for says he  'I want that gaiety of humour which is required in it my conversation is slow and dull my humour saturnine and reserved In short I am none of those who endeavour to break jests in company and make repartees so that those who decry my comedies do me no injury except it be in point of profit Reputation in them is the last thing to which I shall pretend  Defence or the Essay on Dramatic Poetry  '  This ingenuous confession of inability one would imagine were sufficient to silence the clamour of the  critics against Mr Dryden in that particular but however true it may be that Dryden did not succeed to any degree in com  dy I shall endeavour to support my a  ertion that in tragedy with all his faults be is still the most excellent of his time The end of tragedy is to instruct the mind as well as move the passi  s and where there are no shining sentiments the mind may be affected but not improved and however prevalent the passion of grief may be over the heart of man it is certain that he may feel distress in the acutest manner and not be much the wiser for it The tragedies of Otway Lee and Southern are irresistibly moving but they convey not such grand sentiments and their language is far from being so poetical as Dryden's now if one dramatic poet writes to move and another to enchant and instruct as instruction is of greater consequence than being agitated it follows naturally that the latter is the most excellent writer and possesses the greatest genius  But perhaps our poet would have wrote better in both kinds of the drama had not the necessity of his circumstances obliged him to comply with the popular taste He himself in his dedication to the Spanish Fryar insinuates as much  'I remember says he some verses of my own Maximin and Almanzor which cry vengeance upon me for their extravagance All that I can say for those passages which are I hope not many is that I knew they were bad when I wrote them But I repent of them amongst my sins and if any of their fellows intrude by chance into my present writings I draw a veil over all these Dalilahs of the theatre and am resolved I will settle myself no reputation upon the applause of fools 'Tis not that I am mortified to all ambition but I scorn as much to take it from half witted judges as I should to raise an estate by cheating of bubbles Neither do I discommend the lofty stile in tragedy which is naturally  pompous and magnificent but nothing is truely sublime that is not just and proper'  He says in another place  'that his Spanish Fryar was given to the people and that he never wrote any thing in the dramatic way to please himself but his All for Love'  In Mr Dryden was publicly ridiculed on the stage in the duke of Buckingham's comedy called the Rehearsal under the character of Bays This character we are informed in the Key to the Rehearsal was originally intended for Sir Robert Howard under the name of Bilboa but the representation being put a stop to by the breaking out of the plague in it was laid by for several years and not exhibited on the stage till in which interval Mr Dryden being advanced to the Laurel the noble author changed the name of his poet from Bilboa to Bays and made great alterations in his play in order to ridicule several dramatic performances that appeared since the first writing it Those of Mr Dryden which fell under his grace's lash were the Wild Gallant Tyrannic Love the Conquest of Granada Marriage AlaMode and Love in a Nunnery Whatever was extravagant or too warmly expressed or any way unnatural the author has ridiculed by parody  Mr Dryden affected to despise the satire levelled at him in the Rehearsal as appears from his dedication of the translation of Juvenal and Persius where speaking of the many lampoons and libels that had been written against him he says  'I answered not to the Rehearsal because I knew the author sat to himself when he drew the picture and was the very Bays of his own farce because also I knew my betters were more concerned than I was in that satire and lastly because  Mr Smith and Mr Johnson the main pillars of it were two such languishing gentlemen in their conversation that I could liken them to nothing but their own relations those noble characters of men of wit and pleasure about town'  In came out an Essay on Satire said to be written jointly by Mr Dryden and the earl of Mulgrave this piece which was handed about in manuscript containing Reflexions on the Duchess of Portsmouth and the Earl of Rochester who suspecting as Wood says Mr Dryden to be the author hired three ruffians to cudgel him in Wills's coffeehouse at eight o'clock at night This short anecdote I think cannot be told without indignation It proved Rochester was a malicious coward and like other cowards cruel and insolent his soul was incapable of any thing that approached towards generosity and when his resentment was heated he pursued revenge and retained the most lasting hatred he had always entertained a prejudice against Dryden from no other motive than envy Dryden's plays met with success and this was enough to fire the resentment of Rochester who was naturally envious In order to hurt the character and shake the interest of this noble poet he recommended Crown an obscure man to write a Masque for the court which was Dryden's province as poetlaureat to perform Crown in this succeeded but soon after when his play called the Conquest of Jerusalem met with such extravagant applause Rochester jealous of his new favourite not only abandoned him but commenced from that moment his enemy  The other person against whom this satire was levelled was not superior in virtue to the former and all the nation over two better subjects for satire  could not have been found than lord Rochester and the duchess of Portsmouth As for Rochester he had not genius enough to enter the lists with Dryden so he fell upon another method of revenge and meanly hired bravoes to assault him  In came out a translation of Ovid's Epistles in English verse by several hands two of which were translated by Mr Dryden who also wrote the preface In the year following our author published Absalom and Achitophel It was first printed without his name and is a severe satire against the contrivers and abettors of the opposition against King Charles II In the same year that Absalom and Achitophel was published the Medal a Satire was likewise given to the public This piece is aimed against sedition and was occasioned by the striking of a medal on account of the indictment against the earl of Shaftsbury for high treason being found ignoramus by the grand jury at the Old Bailey November For which the Whig party made great rejoicings by ringing of bells bonfires c in all parts of London The poem is introduced with a very satirical epistle to the Whigs in which the author says  'I have one favour to desire you at parting that when you think of answering this poem you would employ the same pens against it who have combated with so much success against Absalom and Achitophel for then you may assure yourselves of a clear victory without the least reply Rail at me abundantly and not break a custom to do it with wit By this method you will gain a considerable point which is wholly to wave the answer of my arguments If God has not blessed you with the talent of rhiming make use of my poor stock and welcome let your verses run upon my feet and for the utmost refuge of notorious blockheads reduced to the last extremity of sense turn my  own lines against me and in utter despair of my own satire make me satirize myself'  The whole poem is a severe invective against the earl of Shaftsbury who was uncle to that earl who wrote the Characteristics Mr Elkanah Settle wrote an answer to this poem entitled the Medal Reversed However contemptible Settle was as a poet yet such was the prevalence of parties at that time that for some years he was Dryden's rival on the stage In came out his Religio Laici or a Layman's Faith this piece is intended as a defence of revealed religion and the excellency and authority of the scriptures as the only rule of faith and manners against Deists Papists and Pres  yterians He acquaints us in the preface that it was written for an ingenious young gentleman his friend upon his translation of Father Simons's Critical History of the Old Testament and that the stile of it was epistolary  In he published a translation of M Maimbourg's History of the League in which he was employed by the command of King Charles II on account of the pla  n parallel between the troubles of France and those of Great Britain Upon the death of Charles II he wrote his Threnodia Augustalis a Poem sacred to the happy memory of that Prince Soon after the accession of James II our author turned Roman Catholic and by this extraordinary step drew upon himself abundance of ridicule from wits of the opposite faction and in he wrote a Defence of the Papers written by the late King of blessed memory found in his strong box Mr Dryden in the abovementioned piece tal  es occasion to vindicate the authority of the Catholic Church in decreeing matters of faith upon this principle that the church is more visible than the scriptures because the scriptures are seen by the church and to abuse  the reformation in England which he affirms was erected on the foundation of lust sacrilege and usurpation Dr Stillingfleet hereupon answered Mr Dryden and treated him with some severity Another author affirms that Mr Dryden's tract is very light in some places ridiculous and observes that his talent lay towards controversy no more in prose than by the Hind and Panther it appeared to do in verse This poem of the Hind and Panther is a direct defence of the Romish Church in a dialogue between a Hind which represents the Church of Rome and a Panther which supports the character of the Church of England The first part of this poem consists most in general characters and narration which says he  'I have endeavoured to raise and give it the majestic turn of heroic poetry The second being matter of dispute and chiefly concerning church authority I was obliged to make as plain and perspicuous as possibly I could yet not wholly neglecting the numbers though I had not frequent occasion for the magnificence of verse The third which has more of the nature of domestic conversation is or ought to be more free and familiar than the two former There are in it two episodes or fables which are interwoven with the main design so that they are properly parts of it though they are also distinct stories of themselves In both of these I have made use of the common places of satire whether true or false which are urged by the members of the one church against the other'  Mr Dryden speaks of his own conversion in the following terms  But gracious God how well dost thou provide  For erring judgments an unerring guide  Thy throne is darkness in th' abyss of light  A blaze of glory that forbids the sight  O teach me to believe thee thus concealed  And search no further than thyself revealed  But her alone for my director take  Whom thou hast promis'd never to forsake  My thoughtless youth was wing'd with vain desires  My manhood long misled by wand'ring fires  Follow'd false lights and when their glimpse was gone  My pride struck out new sparkles of her own  Such was I such by nature still I am  Be thine the glory and be mine the shame  Good life be now my task my doubts are done  Original Poems    This poem was attacked by Mr Charles Montague afterwards Earl of Hallifax and Mr Matthew Prior who joined in writing the Hind and Panther transversed to the Country Mouse and City Mouse Lond to In the preface to which the author observes  'that Mr Dryden's poem naturally falls into ridicule and that in this burlesque nothing is represented monstrous and unnatural that is not equally so in the original'  They afterwards remark that they have this comfort under the severity of Mr Dryden's satire to see his abilities equally lessened with his opinion of them and that he could not be a fit champion against the Panther till he had laid aside his judgment  Mr Dryden is supposed to have been engaged in translating M Varillas's History of Heresies but to have dropped that design This we learn from a passage in Burnet's reflexions on the ninth book of the first volume of M Varillas's History being a reply to his answer  I shall here give the picture the Dr has drawn of this noble poet which is like a great many of the doctor's other characters rather exhibited to  please himself than according to the true resemblance  The doctor says  'I have been informed from England that a gentleman who is famous both for poetry and several other things has spent three months in translating Mr Varillas's history but as soon as my reflexions appeared he discontinued his labours finding the credit of his author being gone Now if he thinks it is recovered by his answer he will perhaps go on with his translation but this may be for ought I know as good an entertainment for him as the conversation he has set on foot between the Hinds and Panthers and all the rest of the animals for whom M Varillas may serve well enough as an author and this history and that poem are such extraordinary things of their kind that it will be but suitable to see the author of the worst poem become the translator of the worst history that the age has produced If his grace and his wit improve so proportionably we shall hardly find that he has gained much by the change he has made from having no religion to chuse one of the worst It is true he had somewhat to sink from in matter of wit but as for his morals it is scarce possible for him to grow a worse man than he was He has lately wreaked his malice on me for spoiling his three months labour but in it he has done me all the honour a man can receive from him which is to be railed at by him If I had illnature enough to prompt me to wish a very bad wish for him it should be that he would go and finish his translation By that it will appear whether the English nation which is the most competent judge of this matter has upon seeing this debate pronounced in M Varillas's favour or me It is true Mr Dryden will suffer a little by it but at least it will serve to keep him in from  other extravagancies and if he gains little honour by this work yet he cannot lose so much by it as he has done by his last employment'  When the revolution was compleated Mr Dryden having turned Papist became disqualified for holding his place and was accordingly dispossessed of it and it was conferred on a man to whom he had a confirmed aversion in consequence whereof he wrote a satire against him called Mac Flecknoe which is one of the severest and best written satires in our language  Mr Richard Flecknoe the new laureat with whose name it is inscribed was a very indifferent poet of those times or rather as Mr Dryden expresses it and as we have already quoted in Flecknoe's life  In prose and verse was own'd without dispute  Thro' all the realms of nonsense absolute  This poem furnished the hint to Mr Pope to write his Dunciad and it must be owned the latter has been more happy in the execution of his design as having more leisure for the performance but in Dryden's Mac Flecknoe there are some lines so extremely pungent that I am not quite certain if Pope has any where exceeded them  In the year wherein he was deprived of the laurel he published the life of St Francis Xavier translated from the French of father Dominic Bouchours In came out a translation of Juvenal and Persius in which the first third sixth tenth and sixteenth satires of Juvenal and Persius entire were done by Mr Dryden who prefixed a long and ingenious discourse by way of dedication to the earl of Dorset In this address our author takes occasion a while to drop his reflexions on  Juvenal and to lay before his lordship a plan for an epic poem he observes that his genius never much inclined him to the stage and that he wrote for it rather from necessity than inclination He complains that his circumstances are such as not to suffer him to pursue the bent of his own genius and then lays down a plan upon which an epic poem might be written to which says he I am more inclined Whether the plan proposed is faulty or no we are not at present to consider one thing is certain a man of Mr Dryden's genius would have covered by the rapidity of the action the art of the design and the beauty of the poetry whatever might have been defective in the plan and produced a work which have been the boast of the nation  We cannot help regretting on this occasion that Dryden's fortune was not easy enough to enable him with convenience and leisure to pursue a work that might have proved an honour to himself and reflected a portion thereof on all who should have appeared his encouragers on this occasion  In Mr Dryden published a translation in prose of Du Fresnoy's Art of Painting with a preface containing a parallel between painting and poetry Mr Pope has addressed a copy of verses to Mr Jervas in praise of Dryden's translation In his translation of Virgil's works came out This translation has passed thro' many editions and of all the attempts which have been made to render Virgil into English The critics I think have allowed that Dryden  This was written before Mr Dodsley's edition of Virgil in English appeared  best succeeded notwithstanding as he himself says when he began it he was past the grand climacteric so little influence it seems age had over him that he retained his judgment and fire in  full force to the last Mr Pope in his preface to Homer says if Dryden had lived to finish what he began of Homer he Mr Pope would not have attempted it after him  'No more says he than I would his Virgil his version of whom notwithstanding some human errors is the most noble and spirited translation I know in any language'  Dr Trap charges Mr Dryden with grossly mistaking his author's sense in many places with adding or retrenching as his turn is best served with either and with being least a translator where he shines most as a poet whereas it is a just rule laid down by lord Roscommon that a translator in regard to his author should  " Fall as he falls and as he rises rise"  Mr Dryden he tells us frequently acts the very reverse of this precept of which he produces some instances and remarks in general that the first six books of the Aeneis which are the best and most perfect in the original are the least so in the translation Dr Trap's remarks may possibly be true but in this he is an instance how easy it is to discover faults in other men's works and how difficult to avoid them in our own  Dr Trap's translation is close and conveys the author's meaning literally so consequently may be fitter for a schoolboy but men of riper judgment and superior taste will hardly approve it if Dryden's is the most spirited of any translation Trap's is the dullest that ever was written which proves that none but a good poet is fit to translate the works of a good poet  Besides the original pieces and translations hitherto mentioned Mr Dryden wrote many others published in six volumes of Miscellanies and in other collections They consist of translations from the Greek  and Latin poets Epistles to several persons prologues and epilogues to several plays elegies epitaphs and songs His last work was his Fables ancient and modern translated into verse from Homer Ovid Boccace and Chaucer To this work which is perhaps one of his most imperfect is prefixed by way of preface a critical account of the authors from whom the fables are translated Among the original pieces the Ode to St Cecilia's day is justly esteemed one of the most elevated in any language It is impossible for a poet to read this without being filled with that sort of enthusiasm which is peculiar to the inspired tribe and which Dryden largely felt when he composed it The turn of the verse is noble the transitions surprizing the language and sentiments just natural and heightened We cannot be too lavish in praise of this Ode had Dryden never wrote any thing besides his name had been immortal Mr Pope has the following beautiful lines in its praise  Essay on Criticism    Hear how Timotheus varied lays surprize  And bid alternate passions fall and rise  While at each change the son of Lybian Jove  Now burns with glory and then melts with love  Now his fierce eyes with sparkling fury glow  Now sighs steal out and tears begin to flow  Persians and Greeks like turns of nature found  And the world's victor stood subdued by sound  The power of music all our hearts allow  And what Timotheus was is Dryden now  As to our author's performances in prose besides his Dedications and Prefaces and controversial Writings they consist of the Lives of Plutarch and Lucian prefixed to the Translation of those Authors by several Hands the Life of Polybius before the Translation of that Historian by Sir  Henry Sheers and the Preface to the Dialogue concerning Women by William Walsh Esquire  Before we give an account of the dramatic works of Dryden it will be proper here to insert a story concerning him from the life of Congreve by Charles Wilson esquire which that gentleman received from the lady whom Mr Dryden celebrates by the name of Corinna of whom it appears he was very fond and who had the relation from lady Chudleigh Dryden with all his understanding was weak enough to be fond of Judicial Astrology and used to calculate the nativity of his children When his lady was in labour with his son Charles he being told it was decent to withdraw laid his watch on the table begging one of the ladies then present in a most solemn manner to take exact notice of the very minute the child was born which she did and acquainted him with it About a week after when his lady was pretty well recovered Mr Dryden took occasion to tell her that he had been calculating the child's nativity and observed with grief that he was born in an evil hour for Jupiter Venus and the sun were all under the earth and the lord of his ascendant afflicted with a hateful square of Mars and Saturn If he lives to arrive at his th year says he  'he will go near to die a violent death on his very birthday but if he should escape as I see but small hopes he will in the d year be under the very same evil direction and if he should escape that also the d or th year is I fear'  here he was interrupted by the immoderate grief of his lady who could no longer hear calamity prophecy'd to befall her son The time at last came and August was the inauspicious month in which young Dryden was to enter into the eighth year of his age The court being in progress and Mr Dryden at leisure he was invited to the country seat of the earl of Berkshire  his brotherinlaw to keep the long vacation with him in Charlton in Wilts his lady was invited to her uncle Mordaunt's to pass the remainder of the summer When they came to divide the children lady Elizabeth would have him take John and suffer her to take Charles but Mr Dryden was too absolute and they parted in anger he took Charles with him and she was obliged to be content with John When the fatal day came the anxiety of the lady's spirits occasioned such an effervescence of blood as threw her into so violent a fever that her life was despaired of till a letter came from Mr Dryden reproving her for her womanish credulity and assuring her that her child was well which recovered he  spirits and in six weeks after she received an ecclaircissement of the whole affair Mr Dryden either thro' fear of being reckoned superstitious or thinking it a science beneath his study was extremely cautious of letting any one know that he was a dealer in Astrology therefore could not excuse his absence on his son's anniversary from a general hunting match lord Berkshire had made to which all the adjacent gentlemen were invited When he went out he took care to set the boy a double exercise in the Latin tongue which he taught his children himself with a strict charge not to stir out of the room till his return well knowing the task he had set him would take up longer time Charles was performing his duty in obedience to his father but as ill fate would have it the stag made towards the house and the noise alarming the servants they hasted out to see the sport One of them took young Dryden by the hand and led him out to see it also when just as they came to the gate the stag being at bay with the dogs made a bold push and leaped over the court wall which was very low and very old and the dogs following threw down a part of the wall ten yards in length under which Charles  Dryden lay buried He was immediately dug out and after six weeks languishing in a dangerous way he recovered so far Dryden's prediction was fulfilled In the twentythird year of his age Charles fell from the top of an old tower belonging to the Vatican at Rome occasioned by a swimming in his head with which he was seized the heat of the day being excessive He again recovered but was ever after in a languishing sickly state In the thirtythird year of his age being returned to England he was unhappily drowned at Windsor He had with another gentleman swam twice over the Thames but returning a third time it was supposed he was taken with the cramp because he called out for help tho' too late Thus the father's calculation proved but too prophetical  Mr Dryden died the first of May and was interred in WestminsterAbby On the th of April he had been very bad with the gout and erisipelas in one leg but he was then somewhat recovered and designed to go abroad on the Friday following he eat a partridge for his supper and going to take a turn in the little garden behind his house in Gerardstreet he was seized with a violent pain under the ball of the great toe of his right foot that unable to stand he cried out for help and was carried in by his servants when upon sending for surgeons they found a small black spot in the place affected he submitted to their present applications and when gone called his son Charles to him using these words  'I know this black spot is a mortification I know also that it will seize my head and that they will attempt to cut off my leg but I command you my son by your filial duty that you do not suffer me to be dismembered'  As he foretold the event proved and his son was too dutiful to disobey his father's commands  On the Wednesday morning following he breathed his last under the most excruciating pains in the th year of his age and left behind him the lady Elizabeth his wife and three sons Lady Elizabeth survived him eight years four of which she was a lunatic being deprived of her senses by a nervous fever in  John another of his sons died of a fever at Rome and Charles as has been observed was drowned in the Thames there is no account when or at what place Harry his third son died  Charles Dryden who was some time usher to pope Clement II was a young gentleman of a very promising genius and in the affair of his father's funeral which I am about to relate shewed himself a man of spirit and resolution  Life of Congreve    The day after Mr Dryden's death the dean of Westminster sent word to Mr Dryden's widow that he would make a present of the ground and all other Abbeyfees for the funeral The lord Halifax likewise sent to the lady Elizabeth and to Mr Charles Dryden offering to defray the expences of our poet's funeral and afterwards to bestow l on a monument in the Abbey which generous offer was accepted Accordingly on sunday following the company being assembled the corpse was put into a velvet hearse attended by eighteen mourning coaches When they were just ready to move lord Jefferys son of lord chancellor Jeffreys a name dedicated to infamy with some of his rakish companions riding by asked whose funeral it was and being told it was Mr Dryden's he protested he should not be buried in that private manner that he would himself with the lady Elizabeth's leave have the honour of the interment and would bestow a thousand pounds on a monument in  the Abbey for him This put a stop to their procession and the lord Jefferys with several of the gentlemen who had alighted from their coaches went up stairs to the lady who was sick in bed His lordship repeated the purport of what he had said below but the lady Elizabeth refusing her consent he fell on his knees vowing never to rise till his request was granted The lady under a sudden surprise fainted away and lord Jeffery's pretending to have obtained her consent ordered the body to be carried to Mr Russel's an undertaker in Cheapside and to be left there till further orders In the mean time the Abbey was lighted up the ground opened the choir attending and the bishop waiting some hours to no purpose for the corpse The next day Mr Charles Dryden waited on my lord Halifax and the bishop and endeavoured to excuse his mother by relating the truth Three days after the undertaker having received no orders waited on the lord Jefferys who pretended it was a drunken frolic that he remembered nothing of the matter and he might do what he pleased with the body Upon this the undertaker waited on the lady Elizabeth who desired a day's respite which was granted Mr Charles Dryden immediately wrote to the lord Jefferys who returned for answer that he knew nothing of the matter and would be troubled no more about it Mr Dryden hereupon applied again to the lord Halifax and the bishop of Rochester who absolutely refused to do any thing in the affair  In this distress Dr Garth who had been Mr Dryden's intimate friend sent for the corpse to the college of physicians and proposed a subscription which succeeding about three weeks after Mr Dryden's decease Dr Garth pronounced a fine l  tin oration over the body which was conveyed from the college attended by a numerous train of  coaches to WestminsterAbbey but in very great disorder At last the corpse arrived at the Abbey which was all unlighted No organ played no anthem sung only two of the singing boys preceded the corpse who sung an ode of Horace with each a small candle in their hand When the funeral was over Mr Charles Dryden sent a challenge to lord Jefferys who refusing to answer it he sent several others and went often himself but could neither get a letter delivered nor admittance to speak to him which so incensed him that finding his lordship refused to answer him like a gentleman he resolved to watch an opportunity and brave him to fight though with all the rules of honour which his lordship hearing quitted the town and Mr Charles never had an opportunity to meet him though he sought it to his death with the utmost application  Mr Dryden had no monument erected to him for several years to which Mr Pope alludes in his epitaph intended for Mr Rowe in this line  Beneath a rude and nameless stone he lies  In a note upon which we are informed that the tomb of Mr Dryden was erected upon this hint by Sheffield duke of Buckingham to which was originally intended this epitaph  This Sheffield raisedThe sacred dust below  Was Dryden once the rest who does not know  Which was since changed into the plain inscription now upon it viz  J DRYDEN  Natus Aug  Mortus Maii  Johannes Sheffield Dux Buckinghamiensis secit  The character of Mr Dryden has been drawn by various hands some have done it in a favourable others in an opposite manner The bishop of Sarum in the history of his own times says that the stage was defiled beyond all example  'Dryden the great master of dramatic poetry being a monster of immodesty and impurities of all sorts'  In Millar's edition of the bishop's work we have the following note upon this passage  'This says the editor must be understood of his performances for the stage for as to his personal character there was nothing remarkably vicious in it but his plays are some of them the fullest of obscenity of any now extant'  The late lord Lansdown took upon himself to vindicate Mr Dryden's character from this severe imputation which was again answered and apologies for it by Mr Burnet the bishop's son But not to dwell on these controversies about his character let us hear what Mr Congreve says in the dedication of Dryden's works to the duke of Newcastle Congreve knew him intimately and as he could have no motive to deceive the world in that particular and being a man of untainted morals none can suspect his authority and by his account we shall see that Dryden was indeed as amiable in private life as a Man as he was illustrious in the eye of the public as a Poet  Mr Dryden says Congreve  'had personal qualities to challenge love and esteem from all who were truly acquainted with him He was of a nature exceeding humane and compassionate easily forgiving injuries and capable of a prompt and sincere reconciliation with those who had offended himHis friendship where he professed it went much beyond his professionsAs his reading had been very extensive so was he very happy in a memory tenacious of every thing he  had read He was not more possessed of knowledge than he was communicative of it but then his communication of it was by no means pedantic or imposed upon the conversation but just such and went so far as by the natural turns of the discourse in which he was engaged it was necessarily prompted or required He was extremely ready and gentle in the correction of the errors of any writer who thought fit to consult him and full as ready and patient to admit of the reprehension of others in respect of his own oversight or mistakes He was of a very easy I may say of very pleasing access but something slow and as it were diffident in his advances to others He had something in his nature that abhorred intrusion in any society whatsoever and indeed it is to be regretted that he was rather blameable on the other extreme He was of all men I ever knew the most modest and the most easy to be discountenanced in his approaches either to his superiors or his equalsAs to his writingsI may venture to say in general terms that no man hath written in our language so much and so various matter and in so various manners so well Another thing I may say was very peculiar to him which is that his parts did not decline with his years but that he was an improving writer to the last even to near years of age improving even in fire and imagination as well as in judgment witness his Ode on St Cecilia's Day and his fables his latest performances He was equally excellent in verse and prose His prose had all the clearness imaginable without deviating to the language or diction of poetry and I have heard him frequently own with pleasure that if he had any talent for writing prose it was owing to his frequentl having read the writings of the great archbishop Tillotson In his poems his diction is wherever his  subject requires it so sublime and so truly poetical that it's essence like that of pure gold cannot be destroyed Take his verses and divest them of their rhimes disjoint them of their numbers transpose their expressions make what arrangement or disposition you please in his words yet shall there eternally be poetry and something which will be found in capable of being reduced to absolute prose what he has done in any one species or distinct kind of writing would have been sufficient to have acquired him a very great name If he had written nothing but his Prefaces or nothing but his Songs or his Prologues each of them would have entitled him to the preference and distinction of excelling in its kind'  Besides Mr Dryden's numerous other performances we find him the author of twentyseven dramatic pieces of which the following is an account  The Wild Gallant a Comedy acted at the theatreroyal and printed in to Lond  The Indian Emperor or the Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards acted with great applause and written in verse  An Evening's Love or the Mock Astrologer a Comedy acted at the theatreroyal and printed in to It is for the most part taken from Corneille's Feint Astrologue Moliere's Depit Amoreux and Precieux Ridicules  Marriage Alamode a Comedy acted at the theatreroyal and printed in to dedicated to the earl of Rochester  Amboyna a Tragedy acted at the theatreroyal and printed in to It is dedicated to the lord Clifford of Chudleigh The plot of this play is chiefly founded in history giving an account of the cruelty of the Dutch towards our countrymen at Amboyna A D  The Mistaken Husband a Comedy acted at the theatreroyal and printed in to Mr Langbaine tells us Mr Dryden was not the author of this play tho' it was adopted by him as an orphan which might well deserve the charity of a scene he bestowed on it It is in the nature of low comedy or farce and written on the model of Plautus's Menaechmi  Aurengezebe or the Great Mogul a Tragedy dedicated to the earl of Mulgrave acted The story is related at large in Taverner's voyages to the Indies vol i part This play is written in heroic verse  The Tempest or the inchanted Island a Comedy acted at the duke of York's theatre and printed in to This is only an alteration of Shakespear's Tempest by Sir William Davenant and Dryden The new characters in it were chiefly the invention and writing of Sir William as acknowledged by Mr Dryden in his preface  Feigned Innocence or Sir Martin Marall a Comedy acted at the duke of York's theatre and printed in to The foundation of this is originally French the greatest part of the plot and some of the language being taken from Moliere's Eteurdi  The Assignation or Love in a Nunnery a Comedy acted at the theatreroyal and printed in to addressed to Sir Charles Sedley This play Mr Langbain tells us was damned on the stage or as the author expresses it in the epistle dedicatory succeeded ill in the representation but whether the fault was in the play itself or in the lameness of the action or in the numbers of its enemies who came resolved to damn it for the title he will not pretend any more than the author to determine  The State of Innocence or the Fall of Man an Opera written in heroic verse and printed in to It is dedicated to her royal highness the  duchess of York on whom the author passes the following extravagant compliment  'Your person is so admirable that it can scarce receive any addition when it shall be glorified and your soul which shines thro' it finds it of a substance so near her own that she will be pleased to pass an age within it and to be confined to such a palace'  To this piece is prefixed an apology for heroic poetry and poetic licence The subject is taken from Milton's Paradise Lost of which it must be acknowledged it is a poor imitation  The Conquest of Granada by the Spaniards in two parts two TragiComedies acted at the theatreroyal and printed These two plays are dedicated to the duke of York and were received on the stage with great applause The story is to be found in Mariana's history of Spain B chap  These plays are written in rhime To the first is prefixed an essay on heroic plays and to the second an essay on the dramatic poetry of the last age  All for Love or the World well Lost a Tragedy acted at the theatreroyal and printed in quarto It is dedicated to the earl of Danby  This is the only play of Mr Dryden's which he says ever pleased himself and he tells us that he prefers the scene between Anthony and Ventidius in the first act to any thing he had written in this kind It is full of fine sentiments and the most poetical and beautiful descriptions of any of his plays the description of Cleopatra in  her barge exceeds any thing in poetry except Shakespear's and his own St Cecilia  Tyrannic Love or the Royal Martyr a Tragedy acted at the theatreroyal It is written in rhime and dedicated to the duke of Monmouth  Troilus and Cressida or Truth found too late a Tragedy acted at the duke's theatre and printed in to It is dedicated to the earl of Sunderland and has a preface prefixed concerning grounds of criticism in tragedy This play was originally Shakespear's and revised and altered by Mr Dryden who added several new scenesThe plot taken from Chaucer's Troilus and Cressida which that poet translated from the original story written in Latin verse by Lollius a Lombard  Secret Love or the Maiden Queen a TragiComedy acted at the theatreroyal and printed in to The serious part of the plot is founded on the history of Cleobuline Queen of Corinth  The Rival Ladies a TragiComedy acted at the theatreroyal It is dedicated to the earl of Orrery The dedication is in the nature of a preface in defence of English verse or rhime  The Kind Keeper or Mr Limberham a Comedy acted at the duke's theatre printed in to It is dedicated to John lord Vaughan Mr Langbain says it so much exposed the keepers about town that all the old letchers were up in arms against it and damned it the third night  The Spanish Fryar or the Double Discovery a Tragi Comedy acted at the duke's theatre and printed It is dedicated to John lord Haughton This is one of Mr Dryden's best plays and still keeps possession of the stage It is said that he was afterwards so much concerned for having ridiculed the character of the Fryar that it impaired his health what effect bigotry or the  influence of priests might have on him on this occasion we leave others to determine  Duke of Guise a Tragedy acted It was written by Dryden and Lee and dedicated to Hyde earl of Rochester This play gave great offence to the Whigs and engaged several writers for and against it  Albion and Albanius an Opera performed at the Queen's theatre in DorsetGardens and printed in folio The subject of it is wholly allegorical and intended to expose my lord Shaftsbury and his party  Don Sebastian King of Portugal a Tragedy acted dedicated to the earl of Leicester  King Arthur or the British worthy a Tragedy acted dedicated to the marquis of Hallifax  Amphytrion or the two Socias a Comedy acted dedicated to Sir Leveson Gower taken from Plautus and Moliere  Cleomenes the Spartan Hero a Tragedy acted at the theatreroyal and printed in to dedicated to the earl of Rochester There is prefixed to it the Life of Cleomenes translated from Plutarch by Mr Creech This play was first prohibited by the lord Chamberlain but upon examination being found innocent of any design to satirize the government it was suffered to be represented and had great success In the preface the author tells us that a foolish objection had been raised against him by the sparks for Cleomenes not accepting the favours of Cassandra  'They says he would not have refused a fair lady I grant they would not but let them grant me that they are no heroes'  Love Triumphant or Nature will prevail a Tragicomedy acted It is dedicated to the earl of Shaftsbury and is the last Mr Dryden wrote or intended for the theatre It met with but  indifferent success tho' in many parts the genius of that great man breaks out especially in the discovery of Alphonso's successful love and in the catastrophe which is extremely effecting  In Obitum JOHAN DRYDENI poetarum

SEDLEY Bart  THIS gentleman who obtained a great name in the world of gallantry was son of Sir John Sedley of Aylesford in Kent When our author was about the age of he became a fellow of Wadham college but he took no degree When he quitted the university he retired into his own country and neither went to travel nor to the inns of cou  t As soon as the restoration was effected Sir Charles came to London  in order to join in the general jubilee and then commenced wit courtier poet and gallant  He was so much applauded in all conversations that he began to be the oracle of the poets and it was by his judgment every performance was approved or condemned which made the King jest with him and tell him that nature had given him a patent to be Apollo's viceroy Lord Rochester bears testimony to this when he puts him soremost among the judges of poetry  I loath the rabble tis enough for me  If Sedley Shadwell Shepherd Wycherly  Godolphin Butler Buckhurst Buckingham  And some few more whom I omit to name  Approve my sense I count their censure fame  It happened by Sir Charles in respect of the king as is said of the famous cardinal Richlieu viz That they who recommended him to the Royal favour thereby supplanted themselves and afterwards envied him but with this difference between the Cardinal and Sir Charles that the latter was never ungrateful When he had a taste of the court as the King never would part with him so he never would part from the King and yet two things proved particularly detrimental to him in it first his estate so far from being improved was diminished and secondly his morals were debauched The King delighted in his conversation and he was the dearer to his Majesty on this account that he never asked a favour whereas some other courtiers by their bold importunity exhausted that prince's treasures who could not deny a man who craved tho' he hated his forwardness nor could remember the silent indigence of his friend tho' he applauded the modesty of it He was deeply immersed in the public distractions of the times and is said to have  committed many debaucheries of which the following instance has been recorded  In the month of June our author Charles lord Buckhurst and Sir Thomas Ogle were convened at a public house in Bowstreet CoventGarden and being enflamed with strong liquors they went up to the balcony belonging to that house and there shewed very indecent postures and gave great offence to the passengers in the street by very unmannerly discharges upon them which done Sedley stripped himself naked and preached to the people in a gross and scandalous manner whereupon a riot being raised the mob became very clamorous and would have forced the door next to the street but being opposed the preacher and his company were driven off the balcony and the windows of a room into which they retired were broken by the mob The frolic being soon spread abroad and as persons of fashion were concerned in it it was so much the more aggravated The company were summoned to appear before a court of justice in WestminsterHall where being indicted for a riot before Sir Robert Hyde lord chief justice of the Common Pleas they were all fined and Sir Charles being sentenced to pay l he used some very impertinent expressions to the judge who thereupon asked him if he had ever read a book called the Compleat Gentleman to which Sir Charles made answer that he had read more books than his lordship  The day for payment being appointed Sir Charles desired Mr Henry Killegrew and another gentleman to apply to his Majesty to have the fine remitted which they undertook to do but in place of supplicating for it they represented Sir Charles's  frolic rather in an aggravating light and not a farthing was abated  After this affair Sir Charles's mind took a more serious turn and he began to apply himself to the study of politics by which he might be of some service to his country He was chosen says Wood a recruiter of that long parliament which began at Westminster the th of May to serve for New Romney in Kent and sat in three succeeding Parliments since the dissolution of that  Sir Charles considered as an author has great delicacy in his turns and Eachard observes in his dedication of Plautus's three comedies to Sir Charles that the easiness of his stile the politeness of his expressions in his Bellamira and even those parts of it which are purely translation are very delightful and engaging to the reader  Lord Rochester in his imitation of the th satire of the first book of Horace has the following verses in his commendation  Sedley has that prevailing gentle art  That can with a resistless charm impart  The loosest wishes to the chastest heart  Raise such a conflict kindle such a fire  Betwixt declining virtue and desire  That the poor vanquish'd maid dissolves away  In dreams all night in sighs and tears all day  Before we give an account of our author's works it will not be amiss to observe that he was extremely active in effecting the revolution which was thought the more extraordinary as he had received favours from King James II That Prince it seems had fallen in love with a daughter of Sir Charles's who was not very handsome for James was remarkable for dedicating his affections  to women who were not great beauties in consequence of his intrigue with her and in order to give her greater lustre in life he created Miss Sedley countess of Dorchester This honour so far from pleasing greatly shocked Sir Charles However libertine himself had been yet he could not bear the thoughts of his daughter's dishonour and with regard to this her exaltation he only considered it as rendering her more conspicuously infamous He therefore conceived a hatred to James and rea  ily joined to dispossess him of his throne and dominions  Being asked one day why he appeared so warm against the King who had created his daughter a Countess It is from a principle of gratitude I am so warm returns Sir Charles for since his Majesty has made my daughter a Countess it is fit I should do all I can to make his daughter a Queen  Our author's works are  The Mulberry Garden a Comedy acted by his Majesty's servants at the theatreroyal dedicated to the duchess of Richmond and Lennox  Anthony and Cleopatra a Tragedy acted at the Duke of York's theatre This play was acted with great applause The Story from Plutarch's Life of Anthony  Bellamira or the Mistress a Comedy acted by his Majesty's servants It is taken from Terence's Eunuch While this play was acting the roof of the playhouse fell down but very few were hurt except the author whose merry friend Sir Fleetwood Shepherd told him that there was so much fire in the play that it blew up the poet house and all Sir Charles answered No the play was so  heavy it brought down the house and buried the poet in his own rubbish  Beauty the Conqueror or the Death of Mark Anthony a Tragedy  Besides these plays Mr Coxeter says he is author of the two following which were never printed till with his works in vols vo dedicated by Briscoe the bookseller to the duke of Chandois  The Grumbler a Comedy of three acts scene Paris  The Tyrant King of Crete a Tragedy  Sedley's poems however amorously tender and delicate yet have not much strength nor do they afford great marks of genius The softness of his verses is denominated by the Duke of Buckingham Sedley's Witchcraft It was an art too successful in those days to propagate the immoralities of the times but it must be owned that in point of chastity he excels Dorset and Rochester who as they conceived lewdly wrote in plain English and did not give themselves any trouble to wrap up their ribbaldry in a dress tollerably decent But if Sedley was the more chaste I know not if he was the less pernicious writer for that pill which is gilded will be swallowed more readily and with less reluctance than if tendered in its own disgustful colours Sedley insinuates gently into the heart without giving any alarm but is no less fraught with poison than are those whose deformity bespeaks their mischief  It would be tedious to enumerate here all the poems of Sir Charles Sedley let it suffice to say that they are printed in two small volumes along with his plays and consist of translations of Virgil's Pastorals original Pastorals Prologues  Songs Epilogues and little occasional pieces  We shall present the reader with an original pastoral of Sir Charles's as a specimen of his works  He lived to the beginning of Queen Anne▪s reign and died at an age near his wit and humour continuing to the last  A Pastoral Dialogue between THIRSIS and STREPHON  THIRSIS  Strephon O Strephon once the jolliest lad  That with shrill pipe did ever mountain glad  Whilome the foremost at our rural plays  The pride and envy of our holidays  Why dost thou sit now musing all alone  Teaching the turtles yet a sadder moan  Swell'd with thy tears why does the neighbouring brook  Bear to the ocean what she never took  Thy flocks are fair and fruitful and no swain  Than thee more welcome to the hill or plain  STREPHON  I could invite the wolf my cruel guest  And play unmov'd while he on all should feast▪  I cou'd endure that very swain outrun  Outthrew outwrestled and each nymph should shun  The hapless Strephon  THIRSIS  Tell me then thy grief  And give it in complaints some short relief  STREPHON  Had killing mildews nipt my rising corn  My lambs been all found dead as soon as born  Or raging plagues run swift through every hive  And left not one industrious bee alive  Had early winds with an hoarse winter's sound  Scatter'd my rip'ning fruit upon the ground  Unmov'd untoucht I cou'd the loss sustain  And a few days expir'd no more complain  THIRSIS  E'er the sun drank of the cold morning dew  I've known thee early the tuskt boar pursue  Then in the evening drive the bear away  And rescue from his jaws the trembling prey  But now thy flocks creep feebly through the fields  No purple grapes thy halfdrest vineyards yields  No primrose nor no violets grace thy beds  But thorns and thistles lift their prickly heads  What means this change  STREPHON  Enquire no more  When none can heal 'tis pain to search the sore  Bright G  latea in whose matchless face  Sat rural innocence with heavenly grace  In whose no less inimitable mind  With equal light even distant virtues shin'd  Chaste without pride and charming without art  Honour the tyrant of her tender heart  Fair goddess of these fields who for our sports  Though she might well become neglected courts  Belov'd of all and loving me alone  Is from my sight I fear for ever gone  THIRSIS  Thy case indeed is pitiful but yet  Thou on thy loss too great a price dost set  Women like days are Strephon some be far  More bright and glorious than others are  Yet none so gay so temperate so clear  But that the like adorn the rowling year  Pleasures imparted to a friend increase  Perhaps divided sorrow may grow less  STREPHON  Others as fair to others eyes may seem  But she has all my love and my esteem  Her bright idea wanders in my thought  At once my poison and my antidote  THIRSIS  Our hearts are paper beauty is the pen  Which writes our loves and blots 'em out agen  Phillis is whiter than the rising swan  Her slender waist confin'd within a span  Charming as nature's face in the new spring  When early birds on the green branches sing  When rising herbs and buds begin to hide  Their naked mother with their shortliv'd pride  Chloe is ripe and as the autumn fair  When on the elm the purple grapes appear  When trees hedgerows and every bending bush  With rip'ning fruit or tasteful berries blush  Lydia is in the summer of her days  What wood can shade us from her piercing rays  Her even teeth whiter than new yean'd lambs  When they with tender cries pursue their dams  Her eyes as charming as the evening sun  To the scorch'd labourer when his work is done  Whom the glad pipe to rural sports invites  And pays his toil with innocent delights  On some of these fond swain fix thy desire  And burn not with imaginary fire  STREPHON  The stag shall sooner with the eagle soar  Seas leave their fishes naked on the shore  The wolf shall sooner by the lamkin die  And from the kid the hungry lion fly  Than I abandon Galatea's love  Or her dear image from my thoughts remove  THIRSIS  Damon this evening carries home his bride  In all the harmless pomp of rural pride  Where for two spotted lambkins newly yean'd  With nimble feet and voice the nymphs contend  And for a coat thy Galatea spun  The Shepherds wrestle throw the bar and run  STREPHON  At that dear name I feel my heart rebound  Like the old steed at the fierce trumpet's sound  I grow impatient of the least delay  No bastard swain shall bear the prize away  THIRSIS  Let us make haste already they are met  The echoing hills their joyful shouts repeat  JOHN CROWNE  WAS the son of an independent minister in that part of North America which is called Nova Scotia The vivacity of his genius made him soon grow impatient of the gloomy education he received in that country which he therefore quitted in order to seek his fortune in England but it was his fate upon his first arrival here to engage in an employment more formal if possible than his American education Mr Dennis in his Letters vol i p has given us the best account of this poet and upon his authority the above and the succeeding circumstances are related His necessity when he first arrived in England was extremely urgent and he was obliged to become a gentleman usher to an old independent lady but he soon grew as weary of that precise office as he had done before of the discipline of Nova Scotia One would imagine that an education such as this would be but an indifferent preparative for a man to become a polite author but such is the irresistable force of genius that neither this nor his poverty which was very deplorable could suppress his ambition aspiring to reputation and distinction rather than to fortune and power His writings soon made him known to the court and town yet it was neither to the favour of the court nor to that of the earl of Rochester  that he was indebted to the nomination the king made of him for the writing the Masque of Calypso but to the malice of that noble lord who designed by that preference to mortify Mr Dryden  Upon the breaking out of the two parties after the pretended discovery of the Popish plot the favour he was in at court and the gaiety of his temper which inclined him to join with the fashion engaged him to embrace the Tory party About that time he wrote the City Politicks in order to satirize and expose the Whigs a comedy not without wit and spirit and which has obtained the approbation of those of contrary principles which is the highest evidence of merit but after it was ready for the stage he met with great embarrassments in getting it acted Bennet lord Arlington who was then lord chamberlain was secretly in the cause of the Whigs who were at that  e potent in Parliament in order to support himself against the power of lord treasurer Danby who was his declared enemy used all his authority to suppress it One while it was prohibited on account of its being dangerous another while it was laid aside upon pretence of its being flat and insipid till Mr Crowne at last was forced to have recourse to the King himself and engage him to lay his absolute commands on the lord chamberlain to have it no longer delayed This command he was pleased to give in his own person for Charles II loved comedy above all other amusements except one which was both more expensive and less innocent and besides had a very high opinion of Mr Crowne's abilities While he was thus in favour with the King and court Mr Dennis declares he has more than once heard him say that though he had a sincere affection for the King he had yet a mortal hatred to the court The promise of a  sum of money made him sometimes appear there to sollicit the payment of it but as soon as he received the sum he vanished and for a long time never approached it  It was at the latter end of King Charles's reign that Mr Crowne tired wi  h the fatigue of writing shocked with the uncertainty of theatrical success and desirous to shelter himself from the resentment of those numerous enemies he had made by his City Politics immediately addressed the King himself and desired his Majesty to establish him in some office that might be a security to him for life the King answered he should be provided for but added that he would first see another comedy Mr Crowne endeavouring to excuse himself by telling the King he plotted slowly and awkwardly his Majesty replied that he would help him to a plot an  so put in his hand the Spanish Comedy called Non Poder Esser Mr Crowne was obliged immediately to go to work upon it but after he had written three acts of it found to his surprize that the Spanish play had some time before been translated and acted and damned under the title of Tarugo's Wiles or the CoffeeHouse yet supported by the King's command he went briskly on and finished it  Mr Crowne who had once before obliged the commonwealth of taste with a very agreeable comedy in his City Politics yet in Sir Courtly Nice went far beyond it and very much surpassed himself for though there is something in the part of Crack which borders upon farce the Spanish author alone must answer for that for Mr Crowne could not omit the part of Crack that is of Tarugo and the Spanish farce depending upon it without a downright affront to the King who had given him the play for his groundwork All  that is of English growth in Sir Courtly Nice is admirable for though it has neither the fine designing of Ben Johnson nor the masculine satire of Wycherley nor the grace delicacy and courtly air of Etherege yet is the dialogue lively and spirited attractively diversified and adapted to the several characters Four of these characters are entirely new yet general and important drawn truly and graphically and artfully opposed to each other Surly to Sir Courtly and Hothead to Testimony those extremes of behaviour the one of which is the grievance and the other the plague of society and conversation excessive ceremony on the one side and on the other rudeness and brutality are finely exposed in Surly and Sir Courtly those divisions and animosities in the two great parties of England which have so long disturbed the public quiet and undermined the general interest are happily represented and ridiculed in Testimony and Hothead Mr Dennis speaking of this comedy says  'that though he has more than twenty times read it yet it still grows upon him and he delivers it as his opinion that the greatest comic poet who ever lived in any age might have been proud to have been the author of it'  The play was now just ready to appear to the world Every one that had seen it rehearsed was highly pleased with it All who had heard of it conceived great expectations and Mr Crowne was delighted with the flattering hope of being made happy for the remaining part of his life by the performance of the King's promise But upon the very last day of the rehearsal he met Underhill coming from the playhouse as he himself was going towards it upon which the poet reprimanding the player for neglecting so considerable a part as he had in the comedy and on a day of so much consequence as the very  last of the rehearsal Oh Lord says Underhill we are all undone how says Crowne is the Playhouse on fire the whole nation replies the player will quickly be so for the King is dead at the hearing of which dismal words the author was thrown almost into distraction for he who the moment before was ravished with the thought of the pleasure he was about to give the King and the favours which he was afterwards to receive from him this moment found to his unspeakable sorrow that his Royal patron was gone for ever and with him all his hopes The King indeed revived from this apoplectic fit but three days after died and Mr Crowne by his death was replunged into the deepest melancholly  Thus far Mr Dennis has traced the life of Crowne in the same letter he promises a further account of him upon another occasion which it seems never occurred for we have not been able to find that he has any where else mentioned our author  The King's death having put a period to Mr Crowne's expectations of courtfavour for the reign of his successor was too much hurried with party designs to admit of any leisure to reward poetical merit though the Prince himself with all his errors about him was a man of taste and had a very quick discernment of the power of genius he no doubt had recourse to writing plays again for bread and supporting himself the best way he could by his wits the most unpleasing and precarious manner of life to which any man can be exposed We cannot be absolutely certain when Mr Crowne died Mr Coxeter in his notes says he was alive in the year and as he must then have been much advanced in years in all probability he did not long survive it  He is the author of Plays  Juliana or the Princess of Poland a TragiComedy acted at the duke of York's theatre dedicated to the earl of Orrery  Andromache a Tragedy acted at the duke's theatre in CoventGarden This play was only a translation of M Racine by a young gentleman chiefly in prose and published by Mr Crown It was brought upon the stage but without success  Calisto or the Chaste Nymph a masque written by command of the queen and oftentimes performed at court by persons of quality It is founded on a story in Ovid  s Metamorphoses lib  The Country Wit a Comedy acted at the duke's theatre This play contains a good deal of low humour and was approved by king Charles the IId  The Destruction of Jerusalem by Tites Vespasian in two parts acted addressed to the duchess of Portsmouth These Tragedies met with extravagant applause which excited the envy of lord Rochester so much that on this account he commenced an enemy to the bard he before had so much befriended  The Ambitious Statesman or the Royal Favourite a Tragedy acted at the theatreroyal This play had but indifferent success though esteemed by the author one of the best he ever wrote  Charles the VIIIth King of France or the Invasion of Naples by the French this play is written in heroic verse  Henry the VIth the first part with the murther of Humphrey duke of

the success of the other pieces of the same author  Regulus a Tragedy acted at the theatreroyal The design of this play is noble the example of Regulus being the most celebrated for honour and constancy of any of the Romans There is a play of this name written by Mr Havard a comedian now belonging to the theatreroyal in Drurylane  The Married Beaux or the Curious Impertinent a Comedy acted at the theatreroyal dedicated to the marquis of Normanby To this play the author has prefixed a preface in vindication of himself from the aspersions cast on him by some persons as to his morals The

Chanter an heroic poem in four Canto's printed in quarto It is a burlesque Poem and is chiefly taken from Boileau's Lutrin  We shall shew Mr Crown's versification by quoting a speech which he puts into the mouth of an Angel in the Destruction of Jerusalem The Angel is represented as descending over the altar prophesying the fall of that august city  Stay stay your flight fond men Heaven does despise  All your vain incense prayers and sacrifice  Now is arriv'd Jerusalem's fatal hour  When she and sacrifice must be no more  Long against Heav'n had'st thou rebellious town  Thy public trumpets of defiance blown  Didst open wars against thy Lord maintain  And all his messengers of peace have slain  And now the hour of his revenge is come  Thy weeks are finish'd and thy slumb'ring doom  Which long has laid in the divine decree  Is now arous'd from his dull lethargy  His army's rais'd and his commission seal'd  His order's given and cannot be repeal'd  And now thy people temple altars all  Must in one total dissolution fall  Heav'n will in sad procession walk the round  And level all thy buildings with the ground  And from the soil enrich'd with human blood  Shall grass spring up where palaces have stood  Where beasts shall feed and a revenge obtain  For all the thousands at thy altars slain  And this once blessed house where Angels came  To bathe their airy wings in holy flame  Like a swift vision or a flash of light  All wrapt in  ire shall vanish in thy sight  And thrown aside amongst the common store  Sink down in time's abyss and rise no more  CHARLES SACKVILLE Earl of DORSET  ELDEST son of Richard earl of Dorset born the th of January was one of the most accomplished gentlemen of the age in which he lived which was esteemed one of the most courtly ever known in our nation when as Pope expresses it  The soldiers ap'd the gallantries of France  And ev'ry flow'ry court  er writ romance  Immediately after the restoration he was chosen member of parliament for EastGrimstead and distinguished himself while he was in the House of Commons The sprightliness of his wit and a most exceeding goodnature recommended him very early to the favour of Charles the IId and those of the greatest distinction in the court but his mi  d being more turned to books and polite conversation than public business he totally declined the latter tho' as bishop Burnet  History of his own times p  says the king courted him as a favorite  Prior in his dedication of his poems observe  that when the honour and safety of his country demanded his assistance he readily entered into the most active parts of life and underwent the dangers with a constancy of mind which shewed he had not only read the rules of philosophy but understood the practice of them He went a volunteer under his royal highness the duke of York in the first Dutch war when the Dutch admiral Opdam was blown up and about thirty capital ships taken and destroyed and his composing a song before the engagement carried with it in the opinion of many people so sedate a presence of mind and such unusual gallantry that it has been much celebrated  This Song upon so memorable an occasion is comprised in the following stanzas  I  TO all you ladies now at land  We men at sea indite  But first would have you understand  How hard it is to write  The Muses now and Neptune too  We must implore to write to you  With a fa la la la la  II  For tho' the Muses should prove kind  And fill our empty brain  Yet if rough Neptune rouze the wind  To wave the azure main  Our paper pen and ink and we  Roll up and down our ships at sea  With a fa c  III  Then if we write not by each post  Think not we are unkind  Nor yet conclude our ships are lost  By Dutchmen or by wind  Our tears we'll send a speedier way  The tide shall waft them twice a day  With a fa c  IV  The king with wonder and surprize  Will swear the seas grow bold  Because the tides will higher rise  Then e'er they did of old  But let him know it is our tears  Bring floods of grief to WhitehallStairs  With a fa c  V  Should foggy Opdam chance to know  Our sad and dismal story  The Dutch would scorn so weak a foe  And quit their fort at Goree  For what resistance can they find  From men who 've left their hearts behind  With a fa c  VI  Let wind and weather do its worst  Be you to us but kind  Let Dutchmen vapour Spaniards curse  No sorrow we shall find  'Tis then no matter how things go  Or who's our friend or who's our foe  With a fa c  VII  To pass our tedious hours away  We throw a merry main  Or else at serious Ombre play  But why should we in vain  Each other's ruin thus pursue  We were undone when we left you  With a fa c  VIII  But now our fears tempestuous grow  And cast our hopes away  Whilst you regardless of our woe  Sit carelesly at play  Perhaps permit some happier man  To kiss your hand or flirt your fan  With a fa c  IX  When any mournful tune you hear  That dies in every note  And if it sigh'd with each man's care  For being so remote  Think then how often love we've made  To you when all those tunes were play'd  With a fa c  X  In justice you cannot refuse  To think of our distress  When we for hopes of honour lose  Our certain happiness  All those designs are but to prove  Ourselves more worthy of your love  With a fa c  XI  And now we've told you all our loves  And likewise all our fears  In hopes this declaration moves  Some pity for our tears  Let's hear of no inconstancy  We have too much of that at sea  With a fa c  To maintain an evenness of temper in the time of danger is certainly the highest mark of heroism but some of the graver cast have been apt to say this sedate composure somewhat differs from that levity of disposition or frolic humour that inclines a man to write a song But let us consider my lord's fervour of youth his gaiety of mind supported by strong spirits flowing from an honest heart and I believe we shall rather be disposed to admire than censure him on this occasion Remember too he was only a volunteer The conduct of the battle depended not on him He had only to shew his intrepidity and diligence in executing the orders of his commander when called on as he had no plans of operation to take up his thoughts why not write a song there was neither indecency nor immorality in it I doubt not but with that chearfulness of mind he composed himself to rest with as right feelings and as proper an address to his maker as any one of a more melancholly disposition or gloomy aspect  Most commanders in the day of battle assume at least a brilliancy of countenance that may encourage their soldiers and they are admired for it to smile at terror has before this been allowed the mark of a hero The dying Socrates discoursed his friends with great composure he was a philosopher  of a grave cast Sir Thomas Moore old enough to be my lord's father jok'd even on the scaffold a strong instance of his heroism and no contradiction to the rectitude of his mind The verses the Emperor Adrian wrought on his deathbed call them a song if you will have been admired and approved by several great men Mr Pope has not only given his opinion in their favour but elegantly translated them nay thought them worthy an imitation perhaps exceeding the original If this behaviour of my lord's is liable to different constructions let good nature and good manners incline us to bestow the most favourable thereon  After his fatigues at sea during the remainder of the reign of Charles the IId he continued to live in honourable leisure He was of the bedchamber to the king and possessed not only his master's favour but in a great degree his familiarity never leaving the court but when he was sent to that of France upon some short commission and embassies of compliment as if the king designed to rival the French in the article of politeness who had long claimed a superiority in that accomplishment by shewing them that one of the most finished gentlemen in Europe was his subject and that he understood his worth so well as not to suffer him to be long out of his presence Among other commissions he was sent in the year to compliment the French king on his arrival at Dunkirk in return of the compliment of that monarch by the duchess of Orleans then in England  Being possessed of the estate of his uncle the earl of Middlesex who died in the year he was created earl of that county and baron of Cranfield by letters patent dated the fourth of April C H and in August succeeded his father as earl of Dorset as also in the post of lord lieutenant of the county of Sussex having been joined  in the commission with him in  Collins's Peerage p vol I  Also the th of February he was made custos rotulorum for that county  Having buried his first lady Elizabeth daughter of Harvey Bagot of Whitehall in the county of Warwick  Esq  widow of Charles Berkley earl of Falmouth without any issue by her he married in the year the lady Mary daughter of James Compton earl of Northampton famed for her beauty and admirable endowments of mind who was one of the ladies of the bedchamber to Queen Mary and left his lordship again a widower August leaving issue by him one son his grace Lionel now duke of Dorset and a daughter the lady Mary married in the year to Henry Somerset duke of Beaufort and dying in childbed left no issue  The earl of Dorset appeared in court at the trail of the seven bishops accompanied with other noblemen which had a good effect on the jury and brought the judges to a better temper than they had usually shewn He also engaged with those who were in the prince of Orange's interest and carried on his part of that enterprize in London under the eye of the court with the same courage and resolution as his friend the duke of Devonshire did in open arms at Nottingham When prince George of Denmark deserted King James and joined the prince of Orange the princess Anne was in violent apprehensions of the King's displeasure and being desirous of withdrawing herself lord Dorset was thought the properest guide for her necessary flight  Burnet's Hist of his own times  She was secretly brought to him by his lady's uncle the bishop of London who furnished the princess  with every thing necessary for her flight to the Prince of Orange and attended her northward as far as Northampton where he quickly brought a body of horse to serve for her guard and went from thence to Nottingham to confer with the duke of Devonshire  After the misguided monarch had withdrawn himself lord Dorset continued at London and was one of those peers who sat every day in the Councilchamber and took upon them the government of the realm in this extremity till some other power should be introduced In the debates in Parliament immediately after this confusion his lordship voted for the vacancy of the throne and that the prince and princess of Orange should be declared King and Queen of England c When their Majesties had accepted the crown of these realms his lordship was the next day sworn of the privycouncil and declared lord chamberlain of the houshold  'A place says Prior which he eminently adorned by the grace of his person the fineness of his breeding and the knowledge and practice of what was decent and magnificent'  It appears by the history of England that he had the honour to stand godfather with King William to a son of the prince and princess of Denmark born at Hamptoncourt the th of July and christened the th by the name of William whom his Majesty declared duke of Gloucester When the King had been earnestly entreated by the States of Holland and the confederate princes in Germany to meet at a general congress to be held at the Hague in order to concert matters for the better support of the confederacy and thereupon took shipping the th of January his lordship was among the peers who to honour their King and Country waited on their sovereign in that cold season  When they were two or three leagues off Goree his Majesty having by bad weather been four days at sea was so impatient to go on shore that taking boat and a thick fog rising soon after they were surrounded so closely with ice as not to be able either to make the shore or get back to the ship so that lying twentytwo hours enduring the most bitter cold and almost despairing of life they could hardly stand or speak at their landing and his lordship was so lame that for some time he did not recover yet on his return to England he neither complained of the accident nor the expence  On the d of February at a chapter of the most noble order of the garter held at Kensington his lordship was elected one of the knights companions of this order with his highness JohnGeorge the fourth elector of Saxony and was installed at Windsor on the February following He was constituted four times one of the regents of the kingdom in his Majesty's absence About the year his health sensibly declining he left public business to those who more delighted in it and appeared only sometimes at council to shew his respect to the commission which he bore for he had already tasted all the comfort which court favour could bestow he had been high in office respected by his sovereign and the idol of the people but now when the evening of life approached he began to look upon such enjoyments with less veneration and thought proper to dedicate some of his last hours to quiet and meditation Being advised to go to Bath for the recovery of his health he there ended his life on the th of January and was buried at Witham on the th of February following  Lord Dorset was a great patron of men of letters and merit Dr Sprat bishop of Rochester  celebrated for his polite writings appealed to him when under a cloud for the part he acted in the reign of King James II and by his lordship's interest preserved himself To him Mr Dryden dedicated his translation of Juvenal in which he is very lavish in his lordship's praise and expresses his gratitude for the bounty he had experienced from him  Mr Prior among others who owed their rise and fortune to my lord Dorset makes this public acknowledgment  'That he scarce knew what life was sooner than he found himself obliged to his favour or had reason to feel any sorrow so sensibly as that of his death'  Mr Prior then proceeds to enumerate the valuable qualities of his patron in which the warmth of his gratitude appears in the most elegant panegyric I cannot imagine that Mr Prior with respect to his lordship's morals has in the least violated truth for he has shewn the picture in various lights and has hinted at his patron's errors as well as his graces and virtues Among his errors was that of indulging passion which carried him into transports of which he was often ashamed and during these little excesses says he  'I have known his servants get into his way that they might make a merit of it immediately after for he who had the good fortune to be chid was sure of being rewarded for it'  His lordship's poetical works have been published among the minor poets and consist chiefly of a poem to Mr Edward Howard on his incomprehensible poem called the British Princes in which his lordship is very satyrical upon that author  Verses to Sir Thomas St Serfe on his printing his play called Tarugo's Wiles acted  An Epilogue to Moliere's Tartuff  An epilogue on the revival of Ben Johnson's play called Every Man in his Humour  A Song writ at Sea in the time of the Dutch war the night before an engagement  Verses addressed to the Countess of Dorchester  A Satirical piece entitled A Faithful Catalogue of our most eminent Ninnies written in the year  Several Songs  From the specimens lord Dorset has given us of his poetical talents we are inclined to wish that affairs of higher consequence had permitted him to have dedicated more of his time to the Muses Though some critics may alledge that what he has given the public is rather pretty than great and that a few pieces of a light nature do not sufficiently entitle him to the character of a first rate poet yet when we consider that notwithstanding they were merely the amusement of his leisure hours and mostly the productions of his youth they contain marks of a genius and as such he is celebrated by Dryden Prior Congreve Pope c  We shall conclude his life with the encomium Pope bestows on him in the following beautiful lines  Dorset the grace of courts the muses pride  Patron of arts and judge of nature dy'd  The scourge of pride the sanctify'd or great  Of fops in learning and of knaves in state  Yet soft his nature tho severe his lay  His anger moral and his wisdom gay  Blest satyrist who touch'd the mean so true  As shew'd vice had his hate and pity too  Blest courtier who could King and Country please  Yet sacred keep his friendship and his ease  Blest peer his great forefathers ev'ry grace  Reflecting and reflected in his race  Where other Buckhursts other Dorsets shine  And patriots still or poets deck the line  Mr GEORGE FARQUHAR  WAS descended of a family of no mean rank in the North of Ireland we have been informed that his father was dean of Armagh but we have not met with a proper confirmation of this circumstance but it is on all hands agreed that he was the son of a clergyman and born at London Derry in that kingdom in the year as appears from Sir James Ware's account of him There he received the rudiments of education and discovered a genius early devoted to the Muses Before he was ten years of age he gave specimens of his poetry in which force of thinking and elegance of turn and expression are manifest and if the auther who has wrote Memoirs of his life may be credited the following stanza's were written by him at that age  The pliant soul of erring youth  Is like soft wax or moisten'd clay  Apt to receive all heavenly truth  Or yield to tyrant ill the sway  Slight folly in your early years  At manhood may to virtue rise  But he who in his youth appears  A fool in age will ne'er be wise  His parents it is said had a numerous family so could bestow no fortune upon him further than  a genteel education When he was qualified for the university he was in sent to Trinity College in Dublin here by the progress he made in his studies he acquired a considerable reputation  Memoirs of Wilks by Obrian Svo  but it does not appear that he there took his degree of bachelor of arts for his disposition being volatile and giddy he soon grew weary of a dull collegiate life and his own opinion of it in that sense he afterwards freely enough displayed in several parts of his comedies and other writings Besides the expence of it without any immediate prospect of returns might be inconsistent with his circumstances The polite entertainments of the town more forcibly attracted his attention especially the diversions of the Theatre for which he discovered a violent propension When Mr Ashbury who then was manager of Dublin Theatre had recruited his company with the celebrated Mr Wilks who had for some feasons engaged with Mr Christopher Rich at DruryLane from whom his encouragement was not equal to his merit Farquhar having acquaintance with him Mr Wilks was soon introduced upon the stage by his means where he did not long continue nor make any considerable figure His person was sufficiently advantageous he had a ready memory proper gesture and just elocution but then he was unhappy in his voice which had not power enough to rouse the galleries or to rant with any success besides he was defective in point of assurance nor could ever enough overcome his natural timidity His more excellent talents however might perhaps have continued the player at Dublin and lost the poet at London but for an accident which was likely to turn a feigned tragedy into a real one The story is this  Mr Farquhar was extremely beloved in Ireland having the advantage of a good person though his voice was weak he never met with the least repulse from the audience in any of his performances He therefore resolved to continue on the stage till something better should offer but his resolution was soon broke by an accident Being to play the part of Guyomar in Dryden's Indian Emperor who kills Vasquez one of the Spanish generals and forgetting to exchange his sword for a foil in the engagement he wounded his brother tragedian who acted Vasquez very dangerously and though it proved not mortal yet it so shocked the natural tenderness of Mr Farquhar's temper that it put a period to his acting ever after  Soon after this Mr Wilks received from Mr Rich a proposal of four pounds a week if he would return to London such was the extent of the salaries of the best players in that time which in our days is not equal to that of a second rate performer which he thought proper to accept of and Mr Farquhar who now had no inducement to remain at Dublin accompanied Mr Wilks to London in the year Mr Wilks who was well acquainted with the humour and abilities of our author ceased not his sollicit  tion 'till he prevailed upon him to write a play assuring him that he was considered by all who knew him in a much brighter light than he had a  yet shewn himself and that he was fitter to exhibit entertaining compositions for the stage than to eccho those of other poets upon it  But he received still higher encouragement by the patronage of the earl of Orrery who was a discorner of merit and saw that as yet Mr Farquhar's went unrewarded His lordship conferred a lieutenant's commission upon him in his own regiment  then in Ireland which he held several years  Memoirs of Mr Farquhar before his Works  and as an officer he behaved himself without reproach and gave several instances both of courage and conduct Whether he received his commission before or after he obliged the town with his first comedy we cannot be certain  In the year his first Comedy called Love and a Bottle appeared on the stage and for its sprightly dialogue and busy scenes was well received by the audience though Wilks had no part in it In the celebrated Mrs Anne Oldfied was partly upon his judgment and recommendation admitted on the Theatre  Now we have mentioned Mrs Oldfield we shall present the reader with the following anecdote concerning that celebrated actress which discovers the true manner of her coming on the stage the account we have from a person who belonged to Mr Rich in a letter he wrote to the editor of Mrs Oldfield's Life in which it is printed in these words  SIR  'In your Memoirs of Mrs Oldfield it may not be amiss to insert the following facts on the truth of which you may depend Her father captain Oldfield not only run out all the military but the paternal bounds of his fortune having a pretty estate in houses in Pallmall It was wholly owing to captain Farquhar that Mrs Oldfield became an actress from the following incident dining one day at her aunt's who kept the Mitre Tavern in St James's Market he heard miss Nanny reading a play behind the bar  with so proper an emphasis and so agreeable turns suitable to each character that he swore the girl was cut out for the stage for which she had before always expressed an inclination being very desirous to try her fortune that way Her mother the next time she saw captain Vanburgh who had a great respect for the family told him what was captain Farquhar's opinion upon which he desired to know whether in the plays she read her fancy was most pleased with tragedy or comedy miss being called in said comedy she having at that time gone through all Beaumont and Fletcher's comedies and the play she was reading when captain Farquhar dined there was the Scornful Lady Captain Vanburgh shortly after recommended her to Mr Christopher Rich who took her into the house at the allowance of fifteen shillings a week However her agreeable figure and sweetness of voice soon gave her the preference in the opinion of the whole town to all our young actresses and his grace the late duke of Bedford being pleased to speak to Mr Rich in her favour he instantly raised her allowance to twenty shillings a week her fame and salary at last rose to her just merit'  'Your humble servant CHARLES TAYLOUR'  Nov  For the moral character of Mrs Oldfield see the Life of Savage    In the beginning of the year Farquhar brought his Constant Couple or Trip to the Jubilee upon the stage it being then the jubilee year at Rome but our author drew so gay and airy a figure in Sir Harry Wildair so suited to Mr Wilk  's talents and so animated by his gesture and vivacity of spirit that it is not determined whether the poet or the player received most reputation by it Towards the latter end of this year we meet with Mr Farquhar in Holland probably upon his military duty from whence he has given a description in two of his letters dated that year from Brill and from Leyden no less true than humorpus as well of those places as the people and in a third dated from the Hague he very facetiously relates how merry he was there at a treat made by the earl of Westmoreland while not only himself but king William and other of his subjects were detained there by a violent storm which he has no less humorously described and has among his poems written also an ingenious copy of verses to his mistress on the same subject Whether this mistress was the same person he calls his charming Penelope in several of his loveletters addressed to her we know not but we have been informed by an old officer in the army who well knew Mr Farquhar that by that name we are to understand Mrs Oldfield and that the person meant by Mrs V in one of them said to be her bedfellow was Mrs Verbruggen the actress the same who was some years before Mrs Mountfort whom Mrs Oldfield succeeded when Mrs V died some years after in childbed with singular commendation in her principal parts and from so bright a flame it was no wonder that Farquhar was more than ordinarily heated The author of Mrs Oldfield's life says that she has often heard her mention some agreeable hours she spent with captain  Farquhar As she was a lady of true delicacy nor meanly prostituted herself to every adorer it would be highly ungenerous to suppose that their hours ever passed in criminal freedoms And 'tis well known whatever were her failings she wronged no man's wise nor had an husband to injure  Mr Farquhar encouraged by the success of his last piece made a continuation of it in and brought on his Sir Harry Wildair in which Mrs Oldfield received as much reputation and was as greatly admired in her part as Wilks was in his  In the next year he published his Miscellanies or Collection of Poems Letters and Essays already mentioned and which contain a variety of humorous and pleasant sallies of fancy There is amongst them a copy of verses addressed to his dear Penelope upon her wearing her Masque the evening before which was a female fashion in those days as well at public walks as among the spectators at the Playhouse These verses naturally display his temper and talents and will afford a very clear idea of them and therefore we shall here insert them  'The arguments you made use of last night for keeping on your masque I endeavoured to defeat with reason but that proving ineffectual I'll try the force of rhyme and send you the heads of our chat in a poetical dialogue between You and I'  YOU  Thus images are veil'd which you adore  Your ignorance does raise your zeal the more  I  All image worship for false zeal is held  False idols ought indeed to be conceal'd  YOU  Thus oracles of old were still receiv'd  The more ambiguous still the more believ'd  I  But oracles of old were seldom true  The devil was in them sure he's not in you  YOU  Thus mask'd in mysteries does the godhead stand  The more obscure the greater his command  I  The Godhead's hidden power would soon be past  Did we not hope to see his face at last  YOU  You are my slave already sir you know  To shew more charms would but increase your woe  I scorn an insult to a conquer'd foe  I  I am your slave 'tis true but still you see  All slaves by nature struggle to be free  But if you would secure the stubborn prize  Add to your wit the fetters of your eyes  Then pleas'd with thraldom would I kiss my chain  And ne'er think more of liberty again  Farquhar's Letters    It is said some of the letters of which we have been speaking were published from the copies returned him at his request by Mrs Oldfield and  that she delighted to read them many years after they were printed as she also did the judicious essay at the end of them which is called a Discourse upon Comedy in Reference to the English Stage but what gives a yet more natural and lively representation of our author still is one among those letters which he calls the Picture containing a description and character of himself which we should not now omit transcribing if his works were not in every body's hands  In came out another Comedy entitled the Inconstant or the Way to Win Him which had sufficient merit to have procured equal success to the rest but for the inundation of Italian French and other farcial interruptions which through the interest of some and the depraved taste of others broke in upon the stage like a torrent and swept down before them all taste for compositions of a more intrinsic excellence These foreign monsters obtained partizans amongst our own countrymen in opposition to English humour genuine wit and the sublime efforts of genius and substituted in their room the airy entertainments of dancing and singing which conveyed no instruction awakened no generous passion nor filled the breast with any thing great or manly Such was the prevalence of these airy nothings that our author's comedy was neglected for them and the tragedy of Phaedra and Hippolitus which for poetry is equal to any in our tongue and though Mr Addison wrote the prologue and Prior the epilogue was suffered to languish while multitudes flocked to hear the warblings of foreign eunuchs whose highest excellence as Young expresses it was  ' Nonsense well tun'd with sweet stupidity'  Very early in the year a farce called the Stage Coach in the composition whereof he was  jointly concerned with another made its first appearance in print and it has always given satisfaction  Mr Farquhar had now been about a twelvemonth married and it was at first reported to a great fortune which indeed he expected but was miserably disappointed The lady had fallen in love with him and so violent was her passion that she resolved to have him at any rate and as she knew Farquhar was too much dissipated in life to fall in love or to think of matrimony unless advantage was annexed to it she fell upon the stratagem of giving herself out for a great fortune and then took an opportunity of letting our poet know that she was in love with him Vanity and interest both uniting to persuade Farquhar to marry he did not long delay it and to his immortal honour let it be spoken though he found himself deceived his circumstances embarrassed and his family growing upon him he never once upbraided her for the cheat but behaved to her with all the delicacy and tenderness of an indulgent husband  His next comedy named the TwinRivals was played in  Our poet was possessed of his commission in the army when the Spanish expedition was made under the conduct of the earl of Peterborough tho' it seems he did not keep it long after and tho' he was not embarked in that service or present at the defeat of the French forces and the conquest of Barcelona yet from some military friends in that engagement he received such distinct relations of it in their epistolary correspondence that he wrote a poem upon the subject in which he has made the earl his hero Two or three years after it was written the impression of it was dedicated by the author's widow to the same nobleman in which  are some fulsome strains of panegyric which perhaps her necessity excited her to use from a view of enhancing her interest by flattery which if excusable at all is certainly so in a woman left destitute with a family as she was  In a comedy called the Recruiting Officer was acted at the theatreroyal He dedicates to all friends round the Wrekin a noted hill near Shrewsbury where he had been to recruit for his company and where from his observations on countrylife the manner that serjeants inveigle clowns to enlist and the behaviour of the officers towards the milkmaids and country wenches whom they seldom fail of debauching he collected matter sufficient to build a comedy upon and in which he was successful Even now that comedy fails not to bring full houses especially when the parts of Captain Plume Captain Brazen Sylvia and Serjeant Kite are properly disposed of  His last play was the Beaux Stratagem of which he did not live to enjoy the full success  Of this pleasing author's untimely end we can give but a melancholy account  He was oppressed with some debts which obliged him to make application to a certain noble courtier who had given him formerly many professions of friendship He could not bear the thought that his wife and family should want and in this perplexity was ready to embrace any expedient for their relief His pretended patron persuaded him to convert his commission into the money he wanted and pledged his honour that in a very short time he would provide him another This circumstance appeared favourable and  the easy bard accordingly sold his commission but when he renewed his application to the nobleman and represented his needy situation the latter had forgot his promise or rather perhaps had never resolved to fulfil it  This distracting disappointment so preyed upon the mind of Mr Farquhar who saw nothing but beggary and want before him that by a sure tho' not sudden declension of nature it carried him off this worldly theatre while his last play was acting in the height of success at that of Drurylane and tho' the audience bestowed the loudest applauses upon the performance yet they could scarce forbear mingling tears with their mirth for the approaching loss of its author which happened in the latter end of April before he was thirty years of age  Thus having attended our entertaining dramatist o'er the contracted stage of his short life thro' the various characters he performed in it of the player the lover and the husband the soldier the critic and the poet to his final catastrophe it is here time to close the scene However we shall take the liberty to subjoin a short character of his works and some farther observations on his genius  It would be injurious to the memory of Wilks not to take notice here of his generous behaviour towards the two daughters of his deceased friend He proposed to his brother managers who readily came into it to give each of them a benefit to apprentice them to mantuamakers which is an instance amongst many others that might be produced of the great worth of that excellent comedian  The general character which has been given of Mr Farquhar's comedies is  'That the success of the most of them far exceeded the author's expectations that he was particularly happy in the choice of his subjects which he took care to  adorn with a variety of characters and incident his style is pure and unaffected his wit natural and flowing and his plots generally well contrived He lashed the vices of the age tho' with a merciful hand for his muse was goodnatured not abounding overmuch with gall tho' he has been blamed for it by the critics It has been objected to him that he was too hasty in his productions but by such only who are admirers of stiff and elaborate performances since with a person of a sprightly fancy those things are often best that are struck off in a heat  Memoirs ubi supra  It is thought that in all his heroes he generally sketched out his own character of a young gay rakish spark blessed with parts and abilities His works are loose tho' not so grossly libertine as some other wits of his time and leave not so pernicious impressions on the imagination as other figures of the like kind more strongly stampt by indelicate and heavier hands'  He seems to have been a man of a  gerius rather sprightly than great rather flow'ry than solid his comedies are diverting because his characters are natural and such as we frequently meet with but he has used no art in drawing them nor does there appear any force of thinking in his performances or any deep penetration into nature but rather a superficial view pleasant enough to the eye though capable of leaving no great impression on the mind He drew his observations chiefly from those he conversed with and has seldom given any additional heightening or indelible marks to his characters which was the peculiar excellence of Shakespear Johnson and Congreve  Had he lived to have gained a more general knowledge of life or had his circumstances not  been st  aitened and so prevented his mingling with persons of rank we might have seen his plays embellished with more finished characters and with a more polish'd dialogue  He had certainly a lively imagination but then it was capable of no great compass he had wit but it was of so peculiar a sort as not to gain ground upon consideration and it is certainly true that his comedies in general owe their success full as much to the player as to any thing intrinsically excellent in themselves  If he was not a man of the highest genius he seems to have had excellent moral qualities of which his behaviour to his wife and tenderness to his children are proofs and deserved a better fate than to die oppressed with want and under the calamitous apprehensions of leaving his family destitute While Farquhar will ever be remembered with pleasure by people of taste the name of the courtier who thus inhumanly ruined him will be for ever dedicated to infamy  EDWARD RAVENSCROFT  THIS gentleman is author of eleven plays which gives him a kind of right to be named in this collection Some have been of opinion he was a poet of a low rate others that he was only a wit collector be this as it may he acquired some distinction by the vigorous opposition he made to Dryden And having chosen so powerful an antagonist he has acquired more honour by it than by all his other works put together he accuses Dryden of plagiary and treats him severely  Mr Dryden indeed had first attacked his Mamamouchi which provoked Ravenscroft to retort so harshly upon him but in the opinion of Mr Langbain the charge of plagiarism as properly belonged to Ravenscroft himself as to Dryden tho' there was this essential difference between the plagiary of one and that of the other that Dryden turned whatever he borrowed into gold and Ravenscroft made use of other people's materials without placing them in a new light or giving them any graces they had not before  Ravenscroft thus proceeds against Mr Dryden  'That I may maintain the character of impartial to which I pretend I must pull off his disguise and discover the politic plagiary that lurks under  it I know he has endeavoured to shew himself master of the art of swift writing and would persuade the world that what he writes is extempore wit currente calamo But I doubt not to shew that tho' he would be thought to imitate the silk worm that spins its webb from its own bowels yet I shall make him appear like the leech that lives upon the blood of men drawn from the gums and when he is rubbed with sa  t spues it up again To prove this I shall only give an account of his plays and by that little of my own knowledge that I shall discover it will be manifest that this rickety poet tho' of so many years cannot go without others assistance for take this prophecy from your humble servant or Mr Ravenscroft's Mamamouchi which you please'  ' When once our poet's translating vein is past  ' From him you can't expect new plays in haste  Thus far Mr Ravenscroft has censured Dryden and Langbain in order to prove him guilty of the same poetical depredation has been industrious to trace the plots of his plays and the similarity of his characters with those of other dramatic poets but as we should reck on it tedious to follow him in this manner we shall only in general take notice of those novels from which he has drawn his plots  We cannot ascertain the year in which this man died he had been bred a templer which he forsook as a dry unentertaining study and much beneath the genius of a poet  His dramatic works are  The Careless Lovers a Comedy acted at the duke's theatre to The scene CoventGarden part of this play is borrowed from Moliere's Monsieur de Pourceaugnac  Mamamouchi or the Citizen turned Gentleman a Comedy acted at the duke's theatre to dedicated to his Highness prince Rupert Part of this play is taken from Moliere's le Bourgeois Gentilhome Scene London  Scaramouch a Philosopher Harlequin a schoolboy Bravo Merchant and Magician a Comedy after the Italian manner acted at the theatreroyal The poet in his preface to this play boasts his having brought a new sort of Comedy on our stage but his critics will not allow any one scene of it to be the genuine offspring of his own brain and denominate him rather the midwife than the parent of this piece part of it is taken from le Burgeois Gentilhome la Marriage Force  The Wrangling Lovers or the Invisible Mistress a Comedy acted at the duke's theatre to This play is founded upon Corneille's Les Engagements du Hazard and a Spanish Romance called Deceptio visus or seeing and believing are two things  King Edgar and Alfreda a Tragedy acted at the theatre royal The story is taken from the Annals of Love a novel and Malmesbury Grafton Stow Speed and other English chronicles  The English Lawyer a Comedy acted at the theatreroyal this is only a translation of the celebrated latin comedy of Ignoramus written by Mr Ruggle of Clarehall Cambridge Scene Bourdeaux  The London Cuckolds a Comedy acted at the duke of York's theatre This play is collected from the novels of various authors and is esteemed one of the most diverting though perhaps the most offensive play of the author's it was first acted This play has hitherto kept possession of the stage a circumstance owing to the annual celebration of the lord mayor's inauguration Though it seems to be growing into a just disesteem It was deprived of its annual appearance at DruryLane Theatre in the year by Mr Garrick whose good sense would not suffer him to continue so unwartantable and ridiculous an insult upon so respectable a body of men as the magistrates of the city of London  The citizens are exposed to the highest ridicule in it and the scenes are loose and indecent The reason why the comic poets have so often declared themselves open enemies of the citizens was plainly this The city magistrates had always opposed the court on which the poets had their dependance and therefore took this method of revenge  Dame Dobson or the Cunning Woman a Comedy acted and damn'd at the duke's theatre printed in quarto This is a translation of a French comedy  The Canterbury Guests or a Bargain Broken a Comedy acted at the theatreroyal in  The Anatomist or the Sham Doctor a Comedy acted at the theatreroyal in Lincoln'sInnFields  The Italian Husband a Tragedy acted at the theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields To this play besides the prologue is prefixed a dialogue which the author calls the prelude managed by the poet a critic and one Mr Peregrine the poet's friend The author here seems to be under the same mistake with other modern writers who are fond of barbarous and bloody stories The Epilogue is written by Jo Haynes  JOHN PHILIPS  A POET of very considerable eminence was son of Dr Stephen Philips archdeacon of Salop and born at Brampton in Oxfordshire December After he had received a grammatical education at home he was sent to Winchester school where he made himself master of the Latin and Greek languages and was soon distinguished for an happy imitation of the excellences which he discovered in the best classical authors With this foundation he was removed to Christ's Church in Oxford where he performed all his university exercises with applause and besides other valuable authors in the poetical way he became particularly acquainted with and studied the works of Milton The ingenious Mr George Sewel in his life and character of our author observes  'that there was not an allusion in Paradise Lost drawn from the thoughts and expressions of Homer or Virgil which Mr Philips could not immediately refer to and by that he perceived what a peculiar life and grace their sentiments added to English poetry how much their images raised its spirit and what weight and beauty their words when translated gave to its language nor was he less curious in observing the force and elegance of his mother tongue but by the example of his darling Milton searched backwards into the  works of our old English poets to furnish him with proper sounding and significant expressions and prove the due extent and compass of the language For this purpose he carefully read over Chancer and Spenser and afterwards in his writings did not scruple to revive any words or phrases which he thought deserved it with that modesty and liberty which Horace allows of either in the coining of new or the restoring of ancient expressions'  Our author however was not so much enamoured of poetry as to neglect other parts of literature but was very well acquainted with the whole compass of natural philosophy He seems in his studies as well as his writings to have made Virgil his pattern and often to have broken out with him in the following rapturous wish in the Second Book of the Georgics which for the sake of the English reader we shall give in Mr Dryden's translation  ' Give me the ways of wand'ring stars to know  ' The depths of heav'n above or earth below  ' Teach me the various labours of the moon  ' And whence proceed th' eclipses of the sun  ' Why flowing tides prevail upon the main  ' And in what dark recess they shrink again  ' What shakes the solid earth what cause delays  ' The summernights and the short winter days'  Mr Philips was a passionate admirer of nature and it is not improbable but he drew his own character in that description which he gives of a philosophical and retired life at the latter end of the first Book of his Cyder  He to his labour hies  Gladsome intent on somewhat that may ease  Unhealthy mortals and with curious search  Examine all the properties of herbs  Fossils and minerals that th' embowell'd earth  Displays if by his industry he can  Benefit human race  Though the reader will easily discover the unpoetical flatness of the above lines yet they shew a great thirst after natural knowledge and we have reason to believe that much might have been attained and many new discoveries made by so diligent an enquirer and so faithful a recorder of physical operations However though death prevented the hopes of the world in that respect yet the passages of that kind which we find in  his Poem on Cyder may convince us of the niceness of his observations in natural causes Besides this he was particularly skilled in antiquities especially those of his own country and part of this study too he has with much art and beauty intermixed with his poetry  While Mr Philips continued at the university he was honoured with the acquaintance of the best and politest men in it and had a particular intimacy with Mr Edmund Smith author of Phaedra and Hippolitus The first poem which got him reputation was his Splendid Shilling which the author of the Tatler has stiled the best burlesque poem in the English Language nor was it only says Mr Sewel  'the finest of that kind in our tongue but handled in a manner quite different from what had been made use of by any author of our own or other nation the sentiments and stile being in this both new whereas in those the jest lies more in allusions to the thoughts and sables of the ancients than in the pomp of expression The same humour is continued thro' the whole and not unnaturally diversified as most poems of that nature had been before  Out of that variety of circumstances which his fruitful invention must suggest to him on such a subject he has not chosen any but what are diverting to every reader and some that none but his inimitable dress could have made diverting to any when we read it we are betrayed into a pleasure which we could not expect tho' at the same time the sublimity of the stile and the gravity of the phrase seem to chastise that laughter which they provoke'  Mr Edmund Smith in his beautiful verses on our Author's Death speaks thus concerning this poem  ' In her best light the comic muse appears  ' When she with borrow'd pride the buskin wears'  This account given by Mr Sewel of the Splendid Shilling is perhaps heightened by personal friendship and that admiration which we naturally pay to the productions of one we love The stile seems to be unnatural for a poem which is intended to raise laughter for that laboured gravity has rather a contrary influence disposing the mind to be serious and the disappointment is not small when a man finds he has been betrayed into solemn thinking in reading the description of a trifle if the gravity of the phrase chastises the laughter the purpose of the poem is defeated and it is a rule in writing to suit the language to the subject Philips's Splendid Shilling may have pleased because its manner was new and we often find people of the best sense throw away their admiration on monsters which are seldom to be seen and neglect more regular beauty and juster proportion  It is with reserve we offer this criticism against the authority of Dr Sewel and the Tatler  but we have resolved to be impartial and the reader who is convinced of the propriety and beauty of the Splendid Shilling has no doubt as good a right to reject our criticism as we had to make it  Our author's coming to London we are informed was owing to the persuasion of some great persons who engaged him to write on the Battle of Blenheim his poem upon which introduced him to the earl of Oxford and Henry St John  esq  afterwards lord viscount Bolingbroke and other noble patrons His swelling stile it must be owned was better suited to a subject of this gravity and importance than to that of a light and ludicrous nature the exordium of this piece is poetical and has an allusion to that of Spenser's Fairy Queen  From low and abject themes the grov'ling muse  Now mounts aerial to sing of arms  Triumphant and emblaze the martial acts  Of Britain's hero  The next poem of our author was his Cyder the plan of which he laid at Oxford and afterwards compleated it in London He was determined to make choice of this subject from the violent passion he had for the productions of nature and to do honour to his native country The poem was founded upon the model of Virgil's Georgics and approaches pretty near it which in the opinion of critics in general and Mr Dryden in particular even excels the Divine Aeneid He imitates Virgil rather like a pursuer than a follower not servilely tracing but emulating his beauties his conduct and management are superior to all other copiers of that original and even the admired Rapin says Dr Sewel is much below  him both in design and success  'for the Frenchman either fills his garden with the idle fables of antiquity or new transformations of his own and in contradiction of the rules of criticism has injudiciously blended the serious and sublime stile of Virgil with the elegant turns of Ovid in his Metamorphosis nor has the great genius of Cowley succeeded better in his Books of Plants who besides the same faults with the former is continually varying his numbers from one sort of verse to another and alluding to remote hints of medicinal writers which though allowed to be useful are yet so numerous that they  atten the dignity of verse and  ink it from a poem to a trea ise of physic'  Dr Sewel has informed us that Mr Philips intended to have written a poem on the Resurrection and the Day of Judgment and we may reasonably presume that in such a work he would have exceeded his other performances This awful subj  t is proper to be treated in a solemn stile and cignified with the noblest images and we need not doubt from his just notions of religion and the gen  ine spirit of poetry which were conspicuous in him he would have carried his readers through these tremendous scenes with an exalted reverence which however might not participate of enthusiasm The meanest soul and the lowest imagination cannot contemplate these alarming events described in Holy Writ without the deepest impressions what then might we not expect from the heart of a good man and the regulated flights and raptures of a christian poet Our author's friend Mr Smith who had probably seen the first rudiments of his design speaks thus of it in a poem upon his death  O had relenting Heaven prolong'd his days  The tow'ring bard had sung in nobler lays  How the last trumpet wakes the lazy dead  How saints aloft the cross triumphant spread  How opening Heav'ns their happier regions shew  And yawning gulphs with slaming vengeance glow  And saints rejoice above and sinners howl below  Well might he sing the day he could not fear  And paint the glories he was sure to wear  All that we have left more of this poet is a Latin Ode to Henry St John  Esq  which is esteemed a masterpiece the stile being pure and elegant the subject of a mixt nature resembling the sublime spirit and gay facetious humour of Horace He was beloved says Dr Sewel  'by all who knew him somewhat reserved and silent amongst strangers but free familiar and casy with his friends he was averse to disputes and thought no time so ill spent and no wit so ill used as that which was employed in such debates his whole life was distinguished by a natural goodness and wellgrounded and unassected piety an universal charity and a steady adherence to his principles no one observed the natural and civil duties of life with a stricter regard whether a son a friend or a member of society and he had the happiness to fill every one of these parts without even the suspicion either of undutifulness insincerity or disrespect Thus he continued to the last not owing his virtues to the happiness of his constitution but the frame of his mind insomuch that during a long sickness which is apt to ruffle the smoothest  temper he never betrayed any discontent or uneasiness the integrity of his life still preserving the chearfulness of his spirits and if his friends had measured their hopes of his life only by his unconcern in his sickness they could not but conclude that either his date would be much longer or that he was at all times pr  pared for death'  He had long been troubled with a lingering consumption attended with an asthma and the summer besore he died by the advice of his physicians he removed to Batly where he got only some present ease but went from thence with but small hopes of recovery and upon the return of the distemper he died at Hereford the th of February He was interred in the Cathedral church of that city with an inscription upon his gravestone and had a monument erected to his memory in Westminsterabbey by Sir Simon Harcourt afterwards lord chancellor the epitaph of which was written by Dr Friend  WILLIAM WALSH  Esq  THIS poet was the son of Joseph Walsh of Aberley in Worcestershire He became a gentlemancommoner of WadhamCollege Oxford in EasterTerm when he was only fifteen years of age he lest it without a degree retired to his native county and some time after went to London He wrote a Dialogue concerning Women being a Defence of the FairSex addressed to Eugenia and printed in the year This is the most considerable of our author's productions and it will be somewhat necessary to take further notice of it which we cannot more effectually do than by transcribing the words of Dryden in its commendationThat great critic thus characterises it  'The perusal of this dialogue in defence of the FairSex written by a gentleman of my acquaintance much surprised me For it was not easy for me to imagine that one so young could have treated so nice a subject with so much judgment It is true I was not ignorant that he was naturally ingenious and that he had improved himself by travelling and from thence I might reasonably have expected that air of gallantry which is so visibly diffused through the body of the work and is indeed the soul that animates all things of this nature but so much variety of reading both in antient and modern authors such digestion of that reading so much justness of thought that it leaves no room for affectation or pedantry I may venture to say are not over common amongst practised writers and very rarely to  be found amongst beginners It puts me in mind of what was said of Mr Waller the father of our English numbers upon the sight of his first verses by the wits of the last age that he came out into the world fortythousand strong before they had heard of him Here in imitation of my friend's apostrophes I hope the reader need not be told that Mr Waller is only mentioned for honour's sake that I am desirous of laying hold on his memory on all occasions and thereby acknowledging to the world that unless he had written none of us all could write My friend had not it seems confidence enough to fend this piece out into the world without my opinion of it that it might pass securely at least among the fair readers for whose service it was principally designed I am not so presuming as to think my opinion can either be his touchstone or his passport but I thought I might send him back to Ariosto who has made it the business of almost thirty stanza's in the beginning of the thirtyseventh book of his Orlando Furioso not only to praise that beautiful part of the creation but also to make a sharp satire on their enemies to give mankind their own and to tell them plainly that from their envy it proceeds that the virtue and great actions of women are purposely concealed and the failings of some few amongst them exposed with all the aggravating circumstances of malice For my own part who have always been their servant and have never drawn my pen against them I had rather see some of them praised extraordinarily than any of them suffer by detraction and that at this age and at this time particularly wherein I find more heroines than heroes let me therefore give them joy of their new champion If any will think me more partial to him than I really am they can only say I have returned his bribe and  the worst I wish him is that he may receive justice from the men and favour only from the ladies'  This is the opinion of Mr Dryden in favour of this piece which is sufficient to establish its reputation Mr Wood the antiquarian observes that this Eugenia was the mistress of Walsh but for this he produces no proof neither is it in the least material whether the circumstance is true or no Mr Walsh is likewise author of several occasional poems printed amongst the works of the Minor Poets and which he first published in the year with some letters amorous and gallant to which is prefixed the following address to the public  Go little book and to the world impart  The faithful image of an amorous heart  Those who love's dear deluding pains have known  May in my fatal sorrows read their own  Those who have lived from all its torments free  May find the things they never felt by me  Perhaps advis'd avoid the gilded bait  And warn'd by my example shun my fate  Whilst with calm joy safe landed on the coast  I view the waves on which I once was tost  Love is a medley of endearments jars  Suspicions quarrels reconcilements wars  Then peace again O would it not be best  To chase the fatal poison from our breast  But since so few can live from passion free  Happy the man and only happy he  Who with such lucky stars begins his love  That his cool judgment does his choice approve▪  Ill grounded passions quickly wear away  What's built upon esteem can ne'er decay  Mr Walsh was of an amorous complexion and in one of his letters mentions three of his amours in pretty singular terms I valued says he  'one mistress after I left loving her I loved another after I left valuing her I love and value the third after having lost all hopes of her and according to the course of my passions I should love the next after having obtained her However from this time forward upon what follies soever you fall be pleased for my sake to spare those of love being very well satisfied there is not one folly of that kind excepting marriage which I have not already committed I have been without raillery in love with the beauty of a woman whom I have never seen with the wit of one whom I never heard speak nor seen any thing she has written and with the heroic vi  tues of a woman without knowing any one action of her that could make me think she had any Cupid will have it so and what can weak mortals do against so potent a god'  Such were the sentiments of our author when he was about years of age  Queen Anne constituted Mr Walsh her master of the horse On what account this place in particular was allotted him we know not but with regard to his literary abilities Mr Dryden in his postscript to his translation of Virgil has asserted that Mr Walsh was the bes  cr  tic then living and Mr Pope speaking of our author thus concludes his Essay on Criticism viz  To him the wit of Greece and Rome was known  And ev'ry author's merit but his own  Such late was Walsh the muses judge and friend  Who justly knew to blame or to commend  To failings mild but zealous for desert  The clearest head and the sincerest heart  In the year the public were obliged with a small posthumous piece of Mr Walsh's entitled Aesculapius or the Hospital of Fools in imitation of Lucian There is printed amongst Mr Walsh's other performances in a volume of the Minor Poets an Essay on Pastoral Poetry with a Short Defence of Virgil against some of the reflexions of M Fontenellé That critic had censured Virgil for writing his pastorals in a too courtly stile which he says is not proper for the Doric Muse but Mr Walsh has very judiciously shewn that the Shepherds in Virgil's time were held in greater estimation and were persons of a much superior figure to what they are now We are too apt to figure the ancient countrymen like our own leading a painful life in poverty and contempt without wit or courage or education but men had quite different notions of these things for the first four thousand years of the world Health and strength were then more in esteem than the refinements of pleasure and it was accounted more honourable to till the ground and keep a flock of sheep than to dissolve in wantonness and effeminating sloth  Mr Walsh's other pieces consist chiefly of Elegies Epitaphs Odes and Songs they are elegant tho' not great and he seems to have had a well cultivated tho' not a very extensive understanding Dryden and Pope have given their sanction in his favour to whom he was personally known a circumstance greatly to his advantage for had there been no personal friendship we have reason to believe their encomiums would have been less lavish at least his works do not carry so high an idea of him as they have done Mr Walsh died about the year  THOMAS BETTERTON  Written by R S  Mr Theophilus Cibber being about to publish in a work entirely uncertaken by himself the Lives and Characters of all our Eminent Actors and Actresses from Shakespear to the present time leaves to the other Gentlemen concerned in this collection the accounts of some players who could not be omitted herein as Poets    ALMOST every circumstance relating to the life of this celebrated actor is exposed to dispute and his manner of first coming on the stage as well as the action of his younger years have been controverted He was son of Mr Betterton undercook to king Charles the Ist and was born in Tothillstreet Westminster some time in the year Having received the rudiments of a genteel education and discovering a great propensity to books it was once proposed he should have been educated to some learned profession but the violence and confusion of the times putting this out of the power of his family he was at his own request bound apprentice to a bookseller one Mr Holden a man of some eminence and then happy in the friendship of Sir William Davenant In the year it is probable Mr Betterton made his first appearance on the stage under the direction of Sir William at the Operahouse in Charterhouseyard It is said that going frequently to the stage about his master's business gave Betterton the first notion of it who shewed such indications of a theatrical genius that Sir William readily accepted him as a performer Immediately after the restoration two distinct companies  were formed by royal authority the first in virtue of a patent granted to Henry Killegrew  Esq  called the king's company the other in virtue of a patent granted to Sir William Davenant which was stiled the duke's company  Cibber's Apology  The former acted at the theatre royal in Drurylane the other at that in Lincoln'sInnFields In order that the theatres might be decorated to the utmost advantage and want none of the embellishments used abroad Mr Betterton by command of Charles II went to Paris to take a view of the French stage that he might the better judge what would contribute to the improvement of our own Upon his return Mr Betterton introduced moving scenes into our theatre which before had the stage only hung with tapestry The scenes no doubt help the representation by giving the spectator a view of the place and increase the distress by making the deception more powerful and afflicting the mind with greater sensibility The theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields being very inconvenient another was built for them in DorsetGarden called the duke's theatre to which they removed and followed their profession with great success during all that reign of pleasure  The stage at this time was so much the care of the state that when any disputes arose they were generally decided by his majesty himself or the duke of York and srequently canvassed in the circle Mr Cibber assigns very good reasons why at this time theatrical amusements were so much in vogue the first is that after a long eclipse of gallantry during the rage of the civil war people returned to it with double ardour the next is that women were then introduced on the stage their parts formerly being supplied by boys or effeminate young men of which the famous Kynaston possessed the capital parts When any art is carried to perfection it seldom happens that at that particular period the  profits arising from it are high and at this time the advantages of playing were very inconsiderable Mr Hart the greatest performer at the king's theatre had but three pounds a week and Mr Betterton then but young very probably had not so much and besides benefits then were things unheard of  In Mr Betterton married a gentlewoman on the same stage one Mrs Saunderson who excelled as an actress every thing but her own conduct in life In her he was compleatly happy and by their joint endeavours even in those days they were able not only to acquire a genteel subsistance but also to save what might support them in an advanced age  Biograph Brittan from the information of Southern    After Sir William Davenant's death the patent came into the hands of his son Dr Charles Davenant so well known to the world by his political writings but whether his genius was less fit than his father's for such an administration or the king's company were really superior to his in acting we cannot determine but they gained upon the town and Dr Davenant was obliged to have recourse to the dramatic opera rich scenes and fine music to support the stage on which Betterton played The Dr himself wrote the Opera of Circe which came first on the stage in and was received with such applause as gave hopes of succeeding in this new way The same year a Pastoral called Calista or the Chaste Nymph written by Mr Crowne at the desire of queen Katherine was represented at court and the ladies Mary and Anne daughters to the duke of York played parts in it On this occasion Mr Betterton instructed the actors and Mrs Betterton gave lessons to the princesses in grateful remembrance of which queen Anne settled a pension of l per annum upon her During this time an emulation subsisted between the two companies and  a theatrical war was proclaimed aloud in which the town reaped the advantage by seeing the parts performed with the greater life The duke's company however maintained it's superiority by means of the new invented artillery of music machines and scenery and other underhand dealings and bribing of actors in the opposite faction from performing their duty By these measures a coalition was effected and the two companies joined together and being united formed one of the perfectest that ever filled a stage in It was in this united company that the merit of Betterton shone with unrivalled lustre and having survived the great actors on whose model he had formed himself he was at liberty to discover his genius in its full extent by replacing many of them with advantage in these very characters in which during their lifetimes they had been thought inimitable and all who have a taste for scenical entertainments cannot but thank the present laureat for preserving for them so lively a portrait of Betterton and painting him in so true a light that without the imputation of blind adulation he may be justly stiled the British Roscius  This account is too important and picturesque to be here omitted and it would be an injury to Betterton not to shew him in that commanding light in which the best judge of that species of excellence has placed him  "Betterton was an actor as Shakespear was an author both without competitors form'd for the mutual assistance and illustration of each others genius how Shakespear wrote all men who have a taste for nature may read and knowbut with what higher rapture would he still be read could they conceive how Betterton play'd him then might they know the one was born alone to speak what the other only knew to write Pity it is that the momentary  beauties flowing from an harmonious elocution cannot like those of poetry be their own record that the animated graces of the player can live no longer than the instant breath and motion that presents them or at best can but saintly glimmer through the memory or imperfect attestation of a few surviving spectators Could how Betterton spoke be as easily known as what he spoke then might you see the muse of Shakespear in her triumph with all their beauties in their best array rising into real life and charming her beholders But alas since all this is so far out of the reach of description how shall I shew you Betterton Should I therefore tell you that all the Othellos Hamlets Hotspurs Mackbeths and Brutus's whom you may have seen since his time have fallen far short of him This still would give you no idea of his particular excelience Let us see then what a particular comparison may do whether that may yet draw him nearer to you  You have seen a Hamlet perhaps who on the first appearance of his father's spirit has thrown himself into all the straining vociferation requisite to express rage and fury and the house has thundered with applause tho' the misguided actor was all the while as Shakespear terms it tearing a passion into ragsI am the more bold to offer you this particular instance because the late Mr Addison while I sate by him to see this scene acted made the same observation asking me with some surprize if I thought Hamlet should be in so violent a passion with the Ghost which though it might have astonished it had not provok'd him for you may observe that in this beautiful speech the passion never rises beyond an almost breathless astonishment or an impatience limited by filial reverence to enquire into the suspected wrongs that may have rais'd him from his peaceful tomb and a desire to know what a spirit so seemingly distrest might wisn or enjoin a sorrowful  son to execute towards his future quiet in the grave this was the light into which Betterton threw this scene which he open'd with a pause of mute amazement then rising slowly to a solemn trembling voice he made the Ghost equally terrible to the spectator as to himself and in the descriptive part of the natural emotions which the ghastly vision gave him the boldness of his expostu  ation was still governed by decency manly but not braving his voice never rising into that seeming outrage or wild defiance of what he naturally rever'd But alas to preserve this medium between mouthing and meaning too little to keep the attention more pleasingly awake by a tempered spirit than by meer vehemence of voice is of all the masterstrokes of an actor the most difficult to reach In this none yet have equall'd Betterton But I am unwilling to shew his superiority only by recounting the errors of those who now cannot answer to them let their farther failings therefore be forgotten or rather shall I in some measure excuse them for I am not yet sure that they might not be as much owing to the false judgment of the spectator as the actor While the million are so apt to be transported when the drum of their ear is so roundly rattled while they take the life of elocution to lie in the strength of the lungs it is no wonder the actor whose end is applause should be so often tempted at this easy rate to excite it Shall I go a little farther and allow that this extreme is more pardonable than its opposite error I mean that dangerous affectation of the monotone or solemn sameness of pronunciation which to my ear is insupportable for of all faults that so frequently pass upon the vulgar that of flatness will have the fewest admirers That this is an error of ancient standing seems evident by what Hamlet says in his instructions to the players viz  Be not too tame neither c  The Actor doubtless is as strongly ty'd down to the rule of Horace as the writer  Si vis me flere dolendum est  Primum ipsi tibi  He that feels not himself the passion he would raise will talk to a sleeping audience But this never was the fault of Betterton and it has often amaz'd me to see those who soon came after him throw out in some parts of a character a just and graceful spirit which Betterton himself could not but have applauded And yet in the equally shining passages of the same character have heavily dragg'd the sentiment along like a dead weight with a long ton'd voice and absent eye as if they had fairly forgot what they were about If you have never made this observation I am contented you should not know where to apply it  A farther excellence in Betterton was that he could vary his spirit to the different characters he acted Those wild impatient starts that fierce and flashing fire which he threw into Hotspur never came from the unruffled temper of his Brutus for I have more than once seen a Brutus as warm as Hotspur when the Betterton Brutus was provoked in his dispute with Cassius his spirit flew only to his eye his steady look alone supply'd that terror which he disdain'd an intemperance in his voice should rise to Thus with a settled dignity of contempt like an unheeding rock he repell'd upon himself the foam of Cassius Perhaps the very words of Shakespear will better let you into my meaning  Must I give way and room to your rash choler  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares  And a little after  There is no terror Cassius in your looks c  Not but in some part of this scene where he reproaches Cassius his temper is not under this suppression but opens into that warmth which becomes a man of virtue yet this is that hasty spark of anger which Brutus himself endeavours to excuse  But with whatever strength of nature we see the poet shew at once the philosopher and the heroe yet the image of the actor's excellence will be still imperfect to you unless language cou'd put colours in our words to paint the voice with  Et si vis similem pingere pinge sonum is enjoining an impossibility The most that a Vandyke can arrive at is to make his portraits of great persons seem to think a Shakespear goes farther yet and tells you what his pictures thought a Betterton steps beyond 'em both and calls them from the grave to breathe and be themselves again in feature speech and motion When the skilful actor shews you all these powers united he gratifies at once your eye your ear and your understanding To conceive the pleasure rising from such harmony you must have been present at it 'tis not to be told you"  Thus was Betterton happy in his fortune in the notice of his sovereign in his fame and character and in a general respect of all ranks of life thus happy might he have continued had he not been persuaded to attempt becoming rich and unluckily engaged in a scheme that swept away all his capital and left him in real distress This accident fell out in and is of too particular a kind to pass unnoticed  Mr Betterton had a great many friends amongst the wealthy traders in the city and so amiable was his private life that all who knew him were concerned and interested in his success Amongst these there was a gentleman whose name the author of his life thinks proper to conceal who entered into the strictest amity with this actor This gentleman in the year was concerned in an adventure to the EastIndies upon the footing then allowed by the company's charter which vessels so employed were stiled interlopers The project of success was great the gain unusually high and this induced Mr Betterton to whom his friend offered any share in the business he pleased to think of so large a sum as eightthousand pounds but it was not for himself as he had no such sum in his power and whoever considers the situation of the stage at that time will need no other argument to convince him of it Yet he had another friend whom he was willing to oblige which was the famous Dr Radcliffe so Mr Betterton advanced somewhat more than twothousand pounds which was his all and the Dr made it up eightthousand The vessel sailed to the EastIndies and made as prosperous a voyage as those concerned in her could wish and the war with France being then very warm the captain very prudently came home north about and arrived safe in Ireland but in his passage from thence he was taken by the French His cargo was upwards of l which ruined Mr Betterton and broke the fortune and heart of his friend in the city As for doctor Radcliffe he expressed great concern for Mr Betterton but none for himself the Dr merrily consoled himself with observing  'that it was only trotting up pair of stairs more and things are as they were'  This accident however fatal to Mr Betterton's fortune yet proved not so to his peace for he bore it without murmur and even without mention so  far from entertaining resentment against his friend in the city who doubtless meant him well he continued his intimacy till his death and after his decease took his only daughter under his protection and watched over her education till she thought proper to dispose of herself in marriage to Mr Bowman the player whose behaviour was such as to gain the esteem of all that knew him he has not been many years dead and reflected credit on the reports of the excellency of the old stage  Such the virtue such the honour of Mr Betterton who in his private character was as amiable as any he borrowed from the poets and therefore was always deservedly considered as the head of the theatre though vested there with very little power The managers as the companies were now united exercised the most despotic stagetyranny and obliged our author to remonstrate to them the hardships they inflicted on their actors and represent that bad policy of the few forgetting their obligations to the many This language in the ears of the theatrical ministry sounded like treason and therefore instead of considering how to remedy the mischiefs complained of they bent their thoughts to get rid of their monitor as if the not hearing of faults was equivalent to mending them It was with this view they began to give away some of Betterton's first parts to young actors  Cibber's Life  supposing this would abate his influence This policy ruined them and assisted him The public refented their having plays ill acted when they knew they might have better  The best players attached themselves wholly to Betterton and desired him to turn his thoughts on some method of procuring himself and them justice Thus theatrical despotism produced its own destruction and the very steps taken to render Betterton  desperate pointed out the way for his deliverance Mr Betterton who had a general acquaintance with people of fashion represented his case to them and at last by the interposition of the earl of Dorset a patent was granted him for building a new playhouse in Lincoln'sInnFields which he effected by a subscription The patentees in order to make head against them got over to their party Mr Williams and Mrs Mountford both eminent players they had also recruits from the country but with all the art of which they were capable they continued still unequal to Mr Betterton's company The new theatre was opened in with very great advantages Mr Congreve accepted of a share with this company as Mr Dryden had formerly with the king's and the first play they acted was Congreve's Comedy of Love for Love The king honoured it with his presence there was a large and splendid audience Mr Betterton spoke a Prologue and Mrs Bracegirdle an Epilogue suited to the occasion and it appeared by the reception they met with that the town knew how to reward the merit of those the patentees used so ill But with all these vast advantages Betterton's company were not able to maintain this flow of prosperity beyond two or three seasons Mr Congreve was a slow writer Vanbrugh and Mr Cibber who wrote for the other house were more expeditious and if they did not finish they at least writ pleasing Comedies  The frequency of newpieces however gave such a turn in their favour that Betterton's company with all their merit had been undone had not the Mourning Bride and the Way of the World come like reprieves and saved them from the last gasp  Cibber's Life  In a few years however it appearing plainly that without a new support from their friends it was impossible for them to maintain their superiority or  independance the patrons of Mr Betterton set about a new subscription for building a theatre in the Haymarket under the direction of Sir John Vanbrugh which was finished in  Memoirs of Vanbrugh's Life  and was to be conducted upon a new plan music and scenery to be intermixed with the drama which with the novelty of a new house was likely to retrieve Mr Betterton's affairs This favour was kindly received by Mr Betterton but he was now grown old his health and strength much impaired by constant application and his fortune still worse than his health he chose therefore as a mutinous spirit occasioned by disappointments grew up amongst the actors to decline the offer and so put the whole design under the conduct of Sir John Vanbrugh and Mr Congreve the latter of whom soon abandoned it entirely and Mr Betterton's strength failing many of the old players dying and other accidents intervening a reunion of the companies became absolutely necessary and soon after took place  Hitherto Betterton is considered as at the head of his company and the affairs of the stage are naturally connected with his as the transactions of a nation are interwoven with the life of a prince After our author reached seventy his infirmities grew upon him greatly his fits of the gout were more lasting and more severe His circumstances also which had not been mended since he took upon him the conduct of the theatre grew more necessitous and all this joined to his wife's ill state of health made his condition melancholy at a time when the highest affluence could not have made them chearful Yet under all these pressures he kept up his spirit and though less active was as serene as ever The public in those days had a grateful remembrance of the pleasure Betterton had given  them and would not suffer so distinguished and so deserving a man after fiftyyears service to withdraw till he had received from them some marks of their favour  In the spring of a benefit was granted to Mr Betterton and the play of Love for Love was acted for that purpose Two of the best actresses that ever graced the stage appeared on it upon that occasion tho' they had long quitted it to render the benefit more advantageous The part of Valentine was performed by Mr Betterton Angelica by Mrs Bracegirdle and Mrs Barry performed that of Frail The epilogue was written by Mr Rowe Mrs Bracegirdle Mrs Barry and Mr Betterton appeared on the stage together and the ladies taking hold of him represented his infirmities of age and pleaded his ancient merit in a very natural and moving manner This epilogue is exquisite in its kind The profits arising from that benefit we are told amounted to l He had also a promise that the favour should be annually continued  These extraordinary acts of public gratitude had a proper effect upon Mr Betterton who instead of indulging himself on their bounty exerted the spirit given by this generosity in their service and appeared and acted as often as his health would permit  History of the stage  On the th of September following in particular he performed the part of Hamlet with such vivacity as well as justice that it gave ample satisfaction to the best judges This activity in the winter kept off the gout longer than usual but the fit returning in the spring was the more unlucky as it happened at the time of his benefit when the success of his play was sure to depend in a great measure upon his own performance The play he made choice of was the Maid's Tragedy in  which he acted the part of Melantius and notice was accordingly given by his good friend the Tatler but the fit intervened and that he might not disappoint the town Mr Betterton was forced to submit to outward applications to reduce the swelling of his feet Which had such an effect that he was able to appear on the stage though he was obliged to use a slipper He acted that day says the Laureat with unusual spirit and briskness by which he obtained universal applause but this could not prevent his paying a very dear price for these marks of approbation since the gouty humour repelled by fomentations soon seized upon the nobler parts which being perhaps weakened by his extraordinary fatigue on that occasion he was not able to make a long resistance But on the th of April he paid the debt to nature and by his death occasioned the most undissembled mourning amongst people of rank and fashion  His behaviour as a man and his abilities as a player raised his character and procured him the esteem of all worthy and good men and such honours were paid his memory as only his memory could deserve  On the second of May his corpse was with much ceremony interred in WestminsterAbbey and the excellent author of the Tatler has given such an account of the solemnity of it as will outlast the Abbey itself And it is no small mortification to us that it is inconsistent with our proposed bounds to transcribe the whole It is writ with a noble spirit there is in it an air of solemnity and grandeur the thoughts rise naturally from one another they fill the mind with an awful dread and consecrate Mr Betterton to immortality with the warmth of friendship heightened by admiration  As to the character of this great man in his profession the reader need but reflect on Mr Colley Cibber's account here inserted who was well qualified  to judge and who in his History of the Stage has drawn the most striking pictures that ever were exhibited even the famous lord Clarendon whose great excellence is characterising is not more happy in that particular than the Laureat no one can read his portraits of the players without imagining he sees the very actors before his eyes their air their attitudes their gesticulations  Mr Betterton was a man of great study and application and with respect to the subjects that employed his attention he was as much a master of them as any man He was an excellent critic more especially on Shakespear and Fletcher Mr Rowe who was a good judge and also studied the same authors with deep attention gives this testimony in his favour and celebrates in the warmest manner Betterton's critical abilities His knowledge of Shakespear's merit gave him so strong and so perfect an esteem for him that he made a pilgrimage into Staffordshire to visit his tomb and to collect whatever particulars tradition might have preserved in relation to his history and these he freely communicated to the same friend who candidly acknowledges that the Memoirs of Shakespear's Life he published were the produce of that journey and freely bestowed upon him by the collector Mr Booth who knew him only in his decline frequently made mention of him and said he never saw him either off or on the stage without learning something from him he frequently observed that Mr Betterton was no actor but he put on his part with his clothes and was the very man he undertook to be 'till the play was over and nothing more So exact was he in following nature that the look of surprize he assumed in the character of Hamlet so astonished Booth when he first personated the Ghost as to disable him for some moments from going on He was so communicative that in the most capital parts he would  enter into the grounds of his action and explain the principles of his art He was an admirable master of the action of the stage considered as independent of sentiment and knew perfectly the connection and business of the scenes so as to attract preserve and satisfy the attention of an audience An art extremely necessary to an actor and very difficult to be attained  What demonstrated his thorough skill in dramatic entertainments was his own performance which was sufficient to establish a high reputation independent of his other merit As he had the happiness to pass through life without reproach a felicity few attain so he was equally happy in the choice of a wife with whom he spent his days in domestic quiet though they were of very different tempers he was naturally gay and chearful she of a melancholy reserved disposition She was so strongly affected by his death which was in some measure sudden that she ran distracted tho' she appeared rather a prudent and constant than a fond and passionate wife She was a great ornament to the stage and her death which happened soon after was a public loss  The Laureat in his Apology thus characterises her  'She was says he though far advanced in years so great a mistress of nature that even Mrs Barry who acted Lady Macbeth after her could not in that part with all her superior strength and melody of voice throw out those quick and careless strokes of terror from the disorder of a guilty mind which the other gave us with a facility in her manner that rendered them at once tremendous and delightsul Time could not impair her skill though it brought her person to decay she was to the last the admiration of all true judges of nature and lovers of Shakespear in whose plays she chiefly excelled and without a rival When  she quitted the stage several good actresses were the better for her instruction She was a woman of an unblemished and sober life and had the honour to teach Queen Anne when Princess the part of Semandra in Mithridates which she acted at court in King Charles's time After the death of Mr Betterton that Princess when Queen ordered her a pension for life but she lived not to receive more than the first half year of it'  Thus we have seen that it is not at all impossible for persons of real worth to transfer a reputation acquired on the stage to the characters they possess in real life and it often happens as in the words of the poet  That scenic virtue forms the rising age  And truth displays her radiance from the stage  The following are Mr Betterton's dramatic works  The Woman made a Justice a Comedy  The Unjust Judge or Appius and Virginia a Tragedy written originally by Mr John Webster an old poet who lived in the reign of James I It was altered only by Mr Betterton who was so cautious and reserved upon this head that it was by accident the fact was known at least with certainty  The Amorous Widow or the Wanton Wife a Play written on the plan of Moliere's George Dandin The Amorous Widow has an underplot interwoven to accommodate the piece to the prevailing English taste Is was acted with great applause but Mr Betterton during his life could never be induced to publish it so that it came into the world as a posthumous performance  The chief merit of this and his other pieces lies in the exact disposition of the scenes their just length great propriety and natural connexions and of how great consequence this is to the fate of either tragedy or comedy may be learned from all Banks's plays which though they have nothing else to recommend them yet never fail to move an audience much more than some justly esteemed superior Who ever saw Banks's earl of Essex represented without tears how few bestow them upon the Cato of Addison  Besides these pieces Betterton wrote several occasional Poems translations of Chaucer's Fables and other little exercises In a word to sum up all that we have been saying with regard to the character of this extraordinary person as he was the most perfect model of dramatic action so was he the most unblemished pattern of private and social qualities Happy is it for that player who imitates him in the one and still more happy that man who copies him in the other  We acknowledge a mistake which we committed in the life of Marloe concerning Betterton It was there observed that he formed himself upon Alleyn the famous founder of DulwichHospital and copied his theatrical excellencies which upon a review of Betterton's life we find could not possibly happen as Alleyn was dead several years before Betterton was born The observation should have been made of Hart    JOHN BANKS  THIS gentleman was bred a lawyer and was a member of the society at New Inn His genius led him to make several attempts in dramatic poetry in which he had various success but even when he met with the greatest encouragement he was very sensible of his error in quitting the profitable practice of the law to pursue the entertainments of the stage but he was fired with a thirst of fame which reconciled to his mind the many uneasy sensations to which the precarious success of his plays and the indigence of his profession naturally exposed him Mr Banks no doubt has gained one part of his design by commencing poet namely that of being remembered after death which Pope somewhere calls the poor estate of wits For this gentleman has here a place amongst the poets while nine tenths of the lawyers of his time now sleep with their fathers secure in oblivion and of whom we can only say they lived and died  Mr Banks's genius was wholly turned for tragedy his language is certainly unpoetical and his numbers unharmonious but he seems not to have been ignorant of the dramatic art For in all his plays he has very forcibly rouzed the passions kept the scene busy and never suffered his characters to languish  In the year Mr Banks offered a tragedy to the stage called the Island Queens or the Death  of Mary Queen of Scots which it seems was rejected whether from its want of merit or motives of a political kind we cannot now determine but Mr Banks thought proper then to publish it In the year he obtained the favour of Queen Anne to command it to be acted at the TheatreRoyal which was done with success for it is really a very moving tragedy It has been often revived and performed at the Theatres with no inconsiderable applause  His dramatic works are  The Rival Kings or the Loves of Oroondates and Statira a Tragedy acted at the TheatreRoyal This play is dedicated to the Lady Catherine Herbert and is chiefly formed on the Romance of Cassandra  The Destruction of Troy a Tragedy acted This play met with but indifferent success  Virtue Betrayed or Anna Bullen a Tragedy acted This play has been often acted with applause  The Earl of Essex or the Unhappy Favourite acted with the most general applause Mr Dryden wrote the Prologue and Epilogue It will be naturally expected that having mentioned the earl of Essex by Banks we should say something of a Tragedy which has appeared this year on the Theatre at CoventGarden of the same name We cannot but acknowledge that Mr Jones has improved the story and heightened the incident in the last act which renders the whole more moving after the scene of parting between Essex and Southampton which is very affecting Rutland's distress upon the melancholy occasion of parting from her husband is melting to the last degree It is in this scene Mr Barry excells all his cotemporaries in tragedy he there shews his power  over our passions and bids the heart bleed in every accent of anguish After Essex is carried out to execution Mr Jones introduces the queen at the tower which has a very happy effect and her manner of behaving on that occasion makes her appear more amiable than ever she did in any play on the same subject Mr Jones in his language in this piece does not affect being very poeticalnor is his versification always mellifluent as in his other writingsbut it is well adapted for speaking The design is well conducted the story rises regularly the business is not suspended and the characters are well sustained  The Island Queens a Tragedy of which we have already given some account the name of it was afterwards changed to the Albion Queens  The Innocent Usurper or the Death of Lady Jane Gray a Tragedy printed It was prohibited the stage on account of some groundless insinuations that it reflected upon the government This play in Banks's own opinion is inferior to none of his former Mr Rowe has written likewise a Tragedy on this subject which is a stock play at both houses it is as much superior to that of our author as the genius of the former was greater than that of the latter  Cyrus the Great a Tragedy This play was at first rejected but it afterwards got upon the stage and was acted with great success the plot is taken from Scudery's Romance of the Grand Cyrus  We cannot ascertain the year in which Banks died He seems to have been a man of parts his characteristic fault as a writer was aiming at the sublime which seldom failed to degenerate into  the bombast fire he had but no judgment to manage it he was negligent of his poetry neither has he sufficiently marked and distinguished his characters he was generally happy in the choice of his fables and he has found a way of drawing tears which many a superior poet has tried in vain  LADY CHUDLEIGH  WAS born in the year and was daughter of Richard Lee of Winslade in the county of Devon  Esq  She had an education in which literature seemed but little regarded being taught no other language than her native tongue but her love of books incessant industry in the reading of them and her great capacity to improve by them enabled her to make a very considerable figure in literature  She was married to Sir George Chudleigh of Ashton in the county of Devon Bart by whom she had issue Eliza Maria who died in the bloom of life much lamented by her mother who poured out her griefs on that occasion in a Poem entitled a Dialogue between Lucinda and Marissa and George who succeeded to the title and estate Thomas and others  She was a lady of great virtue as well as understanding and she made the latter of these subservient to the promotion of the former which was much improved by study but though she was enamoured of the charms of poetry yet she dedicated  some part of her time to the severer study of philosophy as appears from her excellent essays which discover an uncommon degree of piety and knowledge and a noble contempt of those vanitie which the unthinking part of her sex so much regard and so eagerly pursue  The works which this lady produced are  The Ladies Defence or the BrideWoman's Counsellor answered a Poem in a Dialogue between Sir John Brute Sir William Loveall Melissa and a Parson This piece has been several times printed the writing it was occasioned by an angry sermon preached against the fair sex of which her ladyship gives the following account  'Mr Lintot says she some time since intending to reprint my poems desired me to permit him to add to them a Dialogue I had written in the year on a Sermon preached by Mr Sprint a Nonconformist at Sherbourne in Dorsetshire I refusing for several reasons to grant his request he without my knowledge bought the copy of the Bookseller who formerly printed it and without my consent or once acquainting me with his resolution added to it the second edition of my poems and that which makes the injury the greater is his having omitted the Epistle Dedicatory and the Preface by which means he has left the reader wholly in the dark and exposed me to censure When it was first printed I had reason to complain but not so much as now Then the Dedication was left entire as I had written it but the Preface so mangled altered and considerably shortened that I hardly knew it to be my own but being then published without a name I was the less concerned but since notwithstanding the great care I took to conceal it it is known to be mine I  think myself obliged in my own defence to take some notice of it  Preface to her Essays  '  The omission of this Preface which contained an answer to part of the sermon and gave her reasons for writing the poem had occasioned some people to make illnatured reflexions on it this put her ladyship on justifying herself and assuring her readers that there are no reflexions in it levelled at any particular persons besides the author of the Sermon  'him says she I only blame for being too angry for his not telling us our duty in a softer more engaging way address and good manners render reproofs a kindness but where they are wanting admonitions are always taken ill as truths of this sort ought never to be concealed from us so they ought never to be told us with an indecent warmth a respectful tenderness would be more becoming a messenger of peace the disciple of an humble patient meek commiserating Saviour'  Besides this lady's poems of which we shall give some account when we quote a specimen she wrote Essays upon several subjects in prose and verse printed in vo These Essays are upon Knowledge Pride Humility Life Death Fear Grief Riches Selflove Justice Anger Calumny Friendship Love Avarice Solitude and are much admired for the delicacy of the stile there being not the least appearance of false wit or affected expression the too common blemishes of this fort of writing they are not so much the excursions of a lively imagination which can often expatiate on the passions and actions of men with small experience of either as the deliberate result of observations on the world improved with reading regulated with judgment softened by good manners and heightened with sublime thoughts and elevated  piety This treatise is dedicated to her Royal Highness the Princess Sophia Electress and Duchess Dowager of Brunswick on which occasion that Princess then in her th year honoured her with the following epistle written by the Electress in French but which we shall here present to the reader in English  Hanover  June  LADY CHUDLEIGH  You have done me a very great pleasure in letting me know by your agreeable book that there is such a one as you in England and who has so well improved herself that she can in a fine manner communicate her sentiments to all the world As for me I do not pretend to deserve the commendations you give me but by the esteem which I have of your merit and of your good sense I will be always entirely  Your affectionate friend to serve you SOPHIA ELECTRICE  At the end of the second volume of the duke of Wharton's poems are five letters from lady Chudleigh to the revd Mr Norris of Bemmerton and Mrs Eliz Thomas the celebrated Corinna of Dryden  She wrote several other things which though not printed are carefully preserved in the family viz two Tragedies two Operas a Masque some of Lucian's Dialogues translated into Verse Satirical Reflex  ons on Saqualio in imitation of one of Lucian's Dialogues with several small Poems on various Occasions  She had long laboured under the pains of a rheumatism which had confined her to her chamber a considerable time before her death which happened at Ashton in Devonshire December in the  th  year of her age and lies buried there without either monument or inscription  The poetical Works of this Lady consist chiefly in the Song of the Three Children Paraphrased some Pindaric Odes Familiar Epistles and Songs We shall select as a specimen a Dialogue between Lucinda and Marissa occasioned by the death of her Ladyship's Daughter in the early bloom of her youth It is of a very melancholy cast and expressive of the grief she must have felt upon that tender occasion Her ladyship has informed us in her preface to her poems that she generally chose subjects suited to her present temper of mind  'These pieces says she were the employments of my leisure hours the innocent amusements of a solitary life in them the reader will find a picture of my mind my sentiments all laid open to their view they will sometimes see me chearful pleased sedate and quiet at other times grieving complaining and struggling with my passions blaming myself endeavouring to pay homage to my reason and resolving for the future with a decent calmness an unshaken constancy and a resigning temper to support all the troubles all the uneasiness of life and then by unexpected emergencies unforeseen disappointments sudden and surprising turns of fortune discomposed and shocked 'till I have rallied my scattered fears got new strength and by making unwearied re  stance gained the better of my afflictions and restored my mind to its former tranquiliity Would we continues her ladyship contract our desires and learn to think  that only necessary which nature has made so we should be no longer fond of riches honours applauses and several other things which are the unhappy occasions of much mischief to the world and doubtless were we so happy as to have a true notion of the dignity of our nature of those great things for which we were designed and of the duration and felicity of that state to which we are hastening we should scorn to stoop to mean actions and blush at the thoughts of doing any thing below our character'  In this manner does our authoress discover her sentiments of piety We now shall subjoin the specimen  DIALOGUE  MARISSA  O my Lucinda O my dearest friend  Must my afflictions never never end  Has Heav'n for me no pity left in store  Must I O must I ne'er be happy more  Philanda's loss had almost broke my heart  From her alas I did but lately part  And must there still be new occasions found  To try my patience and my soul to wound  Must my lov'd daughter too be snatch'd away  Must she so soon the call of fate obey  In her first dawn replete with youthful charms  She's fled she's fled from my deserted arms  Long did she struggle long the war maintain  But all th' efforts of life alas were vain  Could art have saved her she had still been mine  Both art and care together did combine  But what is proof against the will divine  Methinks I still her dying conflict view  And the sad sight does all my grief renew  Rack'd by convulsive pains she meekly lies  And gazes on me with imploring eyes  With eyes which beg relief but all in vain  I see but cannot cannot ease her pain  She must the burden unassisted bear  I cannot with her in her tortures share  Would they were mine and she stood easy by  For what one loves sure 'twere not hard to die  See how she labours how she pants for breath  She's lovely still she's sweet she's sweet in death  Pale as she is she beauteous does remain  Her closing eyes their lustre still retain  Like setting suns with undiminish'd light  They hide themselves within the verge of night  She's gone she's gone she sigh'd her soul away  And can I can I any longer stay  My life alas has ever tiresome been  And I few happy easy days have seen  But now it does a greater burden grow  I'll throw it off and no more sorrow know  But with her to calm peaceful regions go  Stay thou dear innocence retard thy flight  O stop thy journey to the realms of light  Stay 'till I come to thee I'll swiftly move  Attracted by the strongest passion love  LUCINDA  No more no more let me such language hear  I can't I can't the piercing accents bear  Each word you utter stabs me to the heart  I could from life not from Marissa part  And were your tenderness as great as mine  While I were left you would not thus repine  My friends are riches health and all to me  And while they're mine I cannot wretched be  MARISSA  If I on you could happiness bestow  I still the toils of life would undergo  Would still contentedly my lot sustain  And never more of my hard fate complain  But since my life to you will useless prove  O let me hasten to the joys above  Farewel farewel take take my last adieu  May Heaven be more propitious still to you  May you live happy when I'm in my grave  And no misfortunes no afflictions have  If to sad objects you'll some pity lend  And give a sigh to an unhappy friend  Think of Marissa and her wretched state  How's she's been us'd by her malicious fate  Recount those storms which she has long sustain'd  And then rejoice that she the part has gain'd  The welcome haven of eternal rest  Where she shall be for ever ever bless'd  And in her mother's and her daughter's arms  Shall meet with new with unexperienc'd charms  O how I long those dear delights to taste  Farewel farewel my soul is much in haste  Come death and give the kind releasing blow  I'm tir'd of life and overcharg'd with woe  In thy cool silent unmolested shade  O let me be by their dear relics laid  And there with them from all my troubles free  Enjoy the blessing of a long tranquillity  LUCINDA  O thou dear sufferer on my breast recline  Thy drooping head and mix thy tears with mine  Here rest awhile and make a truce with grief  Consider sorrow brings you no relief  In the great play of life we must not chuse  Nor yet the meanest character refuse  Like soldiers we our general must obey  Must stand our ground and not to fear give way  But go undaunted on 'till we have won the day  Honour is ever the reward of pain  A lazy virtue no applause will gain  All such as to uncommon heighths would rise  And on the wings of fame ascend the skies  Must learn the gifts of fortune to despise  They to themselves their bliss must still confine  Must be unmoved and never once repine  But few to this perfection can attain  Our passions often will th' ascendant gain  And reason but alternately does reign  Disguised by pride we sometimes seem to bear  A haughty port and scorn to shed a tear  While grief within still acts a tragic part  And plays the tyrant in the bleeding heart  Your sorrow is of the severest kind  And can't be wholly to your soul confin'd  Losses like yours may be allowed to move  A gen'rous mind that knows what 'tis to love  These afflictions  Will teach you patience and the careful skill  To rule your passions and command your will  To bear afflictions with a steady mind  Still to be easy pleas'd and still resign'd  And look as if you did no inward sorrow find  MARISSA  I know Lucinda this I ought to do  But oh 'tis hard my frailties to subdue  My headstrong passions will resistance make  And all my firmest resolutions shake  I for my daughter's death did long prepare  And hop'd I should the stroke with temper bear  But when it came grief quickly did prevail  And I soon found my boasted courage fail  Yet still I strove but 'twas alas in vain  My sorrow did at length th' ascendant gain  But I'm resolv'd I will no longer yield  By reason led I'll once more take the field  And there from my insulting passions try  To gain a full a glorious victory  Which 'till I've done I never will give o'er  But still fight on and think of peace no more  With an unwearied courage still contend  'Till death or conquest doth my labour end  THOMAS CREECH  THIS gentleman was born near Sherborne in Dorsetshire and bred up at the free school in that town under Mr Carganven a man of eminent character to whom in gratitude he inscribes one of the Idylliums of Theocritus translated by him His parents circumstances not being sufficient to bestow a liberal education upon him colonel Strangeways who was himself a man of taste and literature took notice of the early capacity of Creech and being willing to indulge his violent propensity to learning placed him at Wadham College in Oxford in the th year of his age anno being then put under the tuition of two of the fellows In the year he was admitted master of arts and soon elected fellow of Allsoul's College at which time he gave distinguished proofs of his classical learning and philosophy before those who  were appointed his examiners The first work which brought our author into reputation was his translation of Lucretius which succeeded so well that Mr Creech had a party formed for him who ventured to prefer him to Mr Dryden in point of genius Mr Dryden himself highly commended his Lucretius and in his preface to the second volume of Poetical Miscellanies thus characterises it  'I now call to mind what I owe to the ingenious and learned translator of Lucretius I have not here designed to rob him of any part of that commendation which he has so justly acquired by the whole author whose fragments only fall to my portion The ways ofour translation are very different he follows him more closely than I have done which became an interpreter to the whole poem I take more liberty because it best suited with my design which was to make him as pleasing as I could He had been too voluminous had he used my method in so long a work and I had certainly taken his had I made it my business to translate the whole The preference then is justly his and I join with Mr Evelyn in the confession of it with this additional advantage to him that his reputation is already established in this poet mine is to make its fortune in the world If I have been any where obscure in following our common author or if Lucretius himself is to be condemned I refer myself to his excellent annotations which I have often read and always with some pleasure'  Many poets of the first class of those times addressed Mr Creech in commendatory verses which are prefixed to the translation of Lucretius but this sudden blaze of reputation was soon obscured by his failing in an arduous task which the success of his Lucretius prompted him to attempt This was a translation of the works of Horace  an author more diversified and consequently more difficult than Lucretius Some have insinuated that Mr Dryden jealous of his rising fame and willing to take advantage of his vanity in order to sink his reputation strenuously urged him to this undertaking in which he was morally certain Creech could not succeed Horace is so various so exquisite and perfectly delightful that he who culls flowers in a garden so replenished with nature's productions must be well acquainted with her form and able to delineate her beauties In this attempt Creech failed and a shade was thrown over his reputation which continued to obscure it to the end of his life It is from this circumstance alledged that Mr Creech contracted a melancholy and moroseness of temper which occasioned the disinclination of many towards him and threw him into habits of recluseness and discontent To this some writers likewise impute the rash attempt on his own life which he perpetrated at Oxford in This act of suicide could not be occasioned by want for Mr Jacob tells us that just before that accident he had been presented by the college to the living of Welling in Hertfordshire Mr Barnard in his Nouvelles de la Republiques de Lettres assigns another cause besides the diminution of his fame which might occasion this disastrous fate Mr Creech though a melancholy man was yet subject to the passion of love It happened that he fixed his affections on a lady who had either previously engaged hers or who could not bestow them upon him this disappointment which was a wound to his pride so affected his mind that unable any longer to support a load of misery he hanged himself in his own chamber Which ever of these causes induced him the event was melancholy and not a little heightened by his being a clergyman in whose heart religion should have taken deeper root and maintained a more salutary  influence than to suffer him thus to stain his laurels with his own blood  Mr Creech's works besides his Lucretius already mentioned are chiefly these  The Second Elegy of Ovid's First Book of Elegies The th th th and th Elegies of Ovid's Second Book of Elegies The d and d Eclogue of Virgil The Story of Lucretia from Ovid de Fastis B ii The Odes Satires and Epistles of Horace already mentioned dedicated to John Dryden  Esq  who is said to have held it in great contempt which gave such a shock to Mr Creech's pride The author in his preface to this translation has informed us that he had not an ear capable of distinguishing one note in music which were there no other was a sufficient objection against his attempting the most musical poet in any language  The same year he published his Translation of the Idylliums of Theocritus with Rapin's Discourse on Pastorals as also the Life of Phelopidas from the Latin of Cornelius Nepos  In Dryden's Translation of Juvenal and Persius Mr Creech did the th Satire of Juvenal and subjoined Notes He also translated into English the verses before Mr Quintenay's Compleat Gardiner The Life of Solon from the Greek of Plutarch Laconic Apophthegms or Remarkable Sayings of the Spartans printed in the first Volume of Plutarch's Morals A Discourse concerning Socrates's Daemon The two First Books of the Symposiacs  These are the works of Mr Creech A man of such parts and learning according to the accounts of all who have written of him that had he not by the last act of his life effaced the merit of his labours he would have been an ornament  as weil to the clerical profession as his country in general He well understood the ancients had an unusual penetration in discovering their beauties and it appears by his own translation of Lucretius how elegantly he could cloath them in an English attire His judgment was solid he was perfectly acquainted with the rules of criticism and he had from nature an extraordinary genius However he certainly overrated his importance or at least his friends deceived him when they set him up as a rival to Dryden but if he was inferior to that great man in judgment and genius there were few of the same age to whom he needed yield the palm Had he been content to be reckoned only the second instead of the first genius of the times he might have lived happy and died regreted and reverenced but like Caesar of old who would ra+ther be the lord of a little village than the second man in Rome his own ambition overwhelmed him  We shall present the reader with a few lines from the second Book of Lucretius as a specimen of our author's versification by which it will be found how much he fell short of Dryden in point of harmony though he seems to have been equal to any other poet who preceded Dryden in that particular  'Tis pleasant when the seas are rough to stand  And view another's danger safe at land  Not 'cause he's troubled but 'tis sweet to see  Those cares and fears from which our selves are free  'Tis also pleasant to behold from far  How troops engage secure ourselves from war  But above all 'tis pleasantest to get  The top of high philosophy and sit  On the calm peaceful flourishing head of it  Whence we may view deep wondrous deep below  How poor mistaken mortals wand'ring go  Seeking the path to happiness some aim  At learning wit nobility or fame  Others with cares and dangers vex each hour  To reach the top of wealth and sov'reign pow'r  Blind wretched man in what dark paths of strife  We walk this little journey of our life  While frugal nature seeks for only ease  A body free from pains free from disease  A mind from cares and jealousies at peace  And little too is needful to maintain  The body sound in health and free from pain  Not delicates but such as may supply  Contented nature's thrifty luxury  She asks no more What tho' no boys of gold  Adorn the walls and sprightly tapers hold  Whose beauteous rays scatt'ring the gawdy light  Might grace the feast and revels of the night  What tho' no gold adorns no music's sound  With double sweetness from the roofs rebound  Yet underneath a loving myrtle's shade  Hard by a purling stream supinely laid  When spring with fragrant flow'rs the earth has spread  And sweetest roses grow around our head  Envy'd by wealth and pow'r with small expence  We may enjoy the sweet delights of sense  Who ever heard a fever tamer grown  In cloaths embroider'd o'er and beds of down  Than in coarse rags  Since then such toys as these  Contribute nothing to the body's ease  As honour wealth and nobleness of blood  'Tis plain they likewise do the mind no good  If when thy fierce embattell'd troops at land  Mockfights maintain or when thy navies stand  In graceful ranks or sweep the yielding seas  If then before such martial sights as these  Disperse not all black jealousies and cares  Vain dread of death and superstitious fears  Not leave thy mind but if all this be vain  If the same cares and dread and fears remain  If Traytorlike they seize thee on the throne  And dance within the circle of a crown  If noise of arms nor darts can make them fly  Nor the gay sparklings of the purple dye  If they on emperors will rudely seize  What makes us value all such things as these  But folly and dark ignorance of happiness  For we as boys at night by day do fear  Shadows as vain and senseless as those are  Wherefore that darkness which o'erspreads our souls  Day can't disperse but those eternal rules  Which from firm premises true reason draws  And a deep insight into nature's laws  ARTHUR MAYNWARING  Esq  A Gentleman distinguished both for poetry and politics as well as the gay accomplishments of life He was born at lghtfield in the year and educated at the grammarschool at Shrewsbury where he remained four or five years and at about seventeen years of age was removed to Christ's Church in Oxford under the tuition of Mr George Smalridge afterwards bishop of Bristol After he removed from Oxford he went into Cheshire where he lived several years with his uncle Mr Francis Cholmondley a gentleman of great integrity and honour but by a political prejudice very averse to the government of William the IIId to whom he refused to take the oaths and instilled antirevolution principles into his nephew  Oldmixon's Life of Maynwaring  who embraced them warmly and on his first entry into life reduced to practice what he held in speculation He wrote several pieces in favour of James the IId's party amongst which was a Panegyric on that King He wrote another intitled the King of Hearts to ridicule lord Delamere's entry into London at his first coming to town after the revolution This poem was said to be Dryden's who was charged with it by Mr Tonson but  he disowned it and told him it was written by an ingenious young gentleman named Maynwaring then about twentytwo years of age  When our author was introduced to the acquaintance of the duke of Somerset and the earls of Dorset and Burlington he began to entertain says Oldmixon very different notions of politics Whether from the force of the arguments made use of by those noblemen or from a desire of preferment which he plainly saw lay now upon the revolution interest cannot be determined but he espoused the Whig ministry as zealously as he had formerly struggled for the exiled monarch  Our author studied the law till he was five or six and twenty years old about which time his father died and left him an estate of near eighthundred pounds a year but so incumbred that the interest money amounted to almost as much as the revenue Upon the conclusion of the peace of Ryswick he went to Paris where he became acquainted with Monsieur Boileau who invited him to his country house entertained him very elegantly and spoke much to him of the English poetry but all by way of enquiry for he affected to be as ignorant of the English Muse as if our nation had been as barbarous as the Laplanders  A gentleman a friend of Mr Maynwaring visiting him some time after upon the death of Mr Dryden  'Boileau said that he was wonderfully pleased to see by the public papers that the English nation had paid so extraordinary honours to one of their poets burying him at the public charge'  and then asked the gentleman who that poet was with as much indifference as if he had never heard Dryden's name which he could no more be unacquainted with than our country was with his for he often frequented lord Montague's house when he was embassador in France  and being also an intimate friend of Monsieur De la Fontaine who had spent some time in England it was therefore impossible he could be ignorant of the same of Dryden but it is peculiar to that nation to hold all others in contempt The French would as fain monopolize wit as the wealth and power of Europe but thanks to the arms and genius of Britain they have attempted both the one and the other without success  Boileau's pretending not to know Dryden to use the words of Milton  'argued himself unknown'  But perhaps a reason may be assigned why the wits of France affected a contempt for Mr Dryden which is this That poet in many of his Prefaces and Dedications has unanswerably shewn that the French writers are really deficient in point of genius that the correctness for which they are remarkable and that even pace which they maintain in all their dramatic compositions is a proof that they are not capable of sublime conceptions that they never rise to any degree of elevation and are in truth uninspired by the musesJudgment they may have to plan and conduct their designs but few French poets have ever found the way of writing to the heart Have they attained the sublime height of Shakespear the tenderness of Otway or the pomp of Rowe and yet these are names which a French versifier will pretend with an air of contempt never to have heard of  The truth is our poets have lately done the French too much honour by translating their pieces and bringing them on the stage as if our own stock was exhausted and the British genius had failed But it is some satisfaction that these attempts seem now to be discouraged we have seen a late play of theirs we call it a play for it was neither a tragedy nor a comedy translated by a languid poet of our own received with the coolness it deserved  But to return to Mr Maynwaring Upon his arrival in England from France he was made one of the commissioners of the customs in which post he distinguished himself by his skill and fidelity Of the latter of these qualities we have an instance in his treatment of a man who sollicited to be a tidewaiter Somebody had told him that his best way to succeed would be to make a present The advice had been perhaps good enough if he had not mistaken his man For understanding that Mr Maynwaring had the best interest at the board of any of the commissioners with the lords of the treasury he sent him a letter with a purse of fiftyguineas desiring his favour towards obtaining the place he sollicited Afterwards he delivered a petition to the board which was read and several of the commissioners having spoke to it Mr Maynwaring took out the purse of fifty guineas and the letter telling them that as long as he could prevent it that man should never have this or any other place in the revenue  Life p xviii xix    Mr Maynwaring was admitted a member of the KitKat Club and was considered as one of the chief ornaments of it by his pleasantry and wit  In the beginning of queen Anne's reign lord treasurer Godolphin engaged Mr Donne to quit the office of auditor of the imprests his lordship paying him several thousand pounds for his doing it and he never let Mr Maynwaring know what he was doing for him till he made him a present of a patent for that office worth about twothousand pounds a year in time of business In the Parliament which met in our author was chosen a burgess for Preston in Lancashire  Ibid p xxii    He had a considerable share in the Medley and was author of several other pieces of which we shall presently give some account  He died at St Albans November the th having some time before made his will in which he left Mrs Oldfield the celebrated actress his executrix by whom he had a son named Arthur Maynwaring He divided his estate pretty equally between that child Mrs Oldfield and his sister Mr Oldmixon tells us that Mr Maynwaring loved this actress for nine or ten years before his death with the strongest passion It was in some measure owing to his instructions that she became so finished a player for he understood the action of the stage as well as any man and took great pleasure to see her excell in it He wrote several Prologues and Epilogues for her and would always hear her rehearse them in private before she spoke them on the stage His friends of both sexes quarrelled with him for his attachment to her and so much resented it that Mrs Oldfield frequently remonstrated to him that it was for his honour and interest to break off the intrigue which frankness and friendship of hers did as he often confessed but engage him the more firmly and all his friends at last gave over importuning him to leave her as she gained more and more upon him  In honour of our author Mr Oldmixon observes that he had an abhorrence of those that swore or talked profanely in conversation He looked upon it as a poor pretence to wit and never excused it in himself or othersI have already observed that our author had a share in the Medley a paper then set up in favour of the Hanoverian succession in which he combats the Examiner who wrote on the opposite or at least the HighChurch Interest  He also wrote the following pieces  Remarks on a late Romance intitled the Memorial of the Church of England or the History of the Ten Champions  A Translation of the second Ode of the first book of Horace  A Translation of the fifth Book of Ovid's Metamorphoses  A Character of the new Ministers  Several Songs Poems Prologues and Epil  gues  There was a Manuscript given him to peruse which contained Memoirs of the duke of Marlborough's famous march to Blenheim It was written by a chaplain of the duke's with great exactness as to the incidents but was defective in form Mr Maynwaring was desired to alter and improve it which he found too difficult a talk but being great  y pleased with the particular account of all that pass'd in that surprizing march he resolved that it should not be lost and to give it a new and more perfect form himself by reducing a kind of diary into a regular history These papers fell into the hands of Sir Richard Steel  A Translation of part of Tully's Offices  Four Letters to a Friend in NorthBritain written upon the publishing Dr Sacheveral's Trial  The History of Hannibal and Hanno from the best authors In this piece he is supposed to intend by Hannibal the duke of Marlborough by Hanno the lord treasurer Oxford by Valerius Flaccus count Tallard and by Asdrubal Dr Robinson bishop of Bristol  The Speech of Alcibiades to the Athenians printed in the WhigExaminer Numb  The French King's Promise to the Pretender  A Short Account and Defence of the Barrier Treaty  Remarks upon the present Negotiation of Peace begun between GreatBritain and France  The Bewdley Case  He had a considerable hand in a Letter to a HighChurchman  He revived and published a treatise called Bouchain in a Dialogue between the Medley and the Examiner about the management of the war in  He wrote a Letter to the Freeholders a little before the election of the new Parliament  He had a great hand in a pamphlet entitled the British Academy wherein he rallied Dr Swift's Letter to the lord treasurer Oxford about altering the English language  The Letter from Doway was written by him or some friend of his with his assistance  These are chiefly the works of Maynwaring who was a gentleman of genius and appears to have been a goodnatur'd honest man His moral life has only been blamed for his intrigue with Mrs Oldfield but I am persuaded when the accomplishments of that lady are remembered  and the delicacy of an amour between people of their fashion is considered that the most rigid in chastity will be disposed rather to pity than indignation The force of love is hardly to be conquered by reason and he must have a stoical constitution indeed who has read the descriptions given of Mrs Oldfield's person as well as the endowments of her mind and the sweetness of her disposition who severely condemn a man for loving her none but those who have been in love can say how forcibly the passion moves and to what extravagance it will often carry the wisest men and with Mr Maynwaring's opportunities who could have refisted the charms of Mrs Oldfield  The HON Mrs MONK  THIS Lady was the daughter of the Right Hon the Lord Molesworth a nobleman of Ireland and wife of George Monk  Esq  By the force of her natural genius she learnt the Latin Italian and Spanish tongues and by a constant reading of the best authors in those languages became so great a proficient especially in poetry that she wrote many pieces that were deemed worthy of publication and soon after her death were printed and published with the following title Marinda Poems and Translations upon several occasions printed in London The book is addressed to her Royal Highness Carolina Princess of Wales in a long dedication dated March written by her father who thus affectionately speaks of the poems and their author  'Most of them says he are the product of the leisure hours of a young gentlewoman lately deceased who in a remote country retirement without omitting the daily care due to a large family not only perfectly acquired the several languages here made use of but tho good morals and principles contained in those books so as to put them in practice as well during her life and languishing sickness as the hour of her death in short she died not only like a Christian but a Roman lady and so became at once the object of  the grief and comfort of her relations As much as I am obliged to be sparing in commending what belongs to me I cannot forbear thinking som of these circumstances uncommon enough to be taken notice of I loved her more because she deserved it than because she was mine and I cannot do greater honour to her memory than by consecrating her labours or rather diversion to your Royal Highness as we found most of them in her es rutore after her death written with her own hand little expecting and as little desiring the public should have any opportunity either of applauding or condemning them'  Mr Jacob tells us that these Poems and Translations shew the true spirit and numbers of poetry a delicacy of turn and justness of thought and expression They consist of Ecclogues the Masque of the Virtues against Love from Gu  rini some translations from the French and Italians Familiar Epistles Odes and Madrigals  Her poetry has great warmth and tenderness of sentiment The following Epitaph on a lady of pleasure was written by her  O'er this marble drop a tear  Here lies fair Rosalinde  All mankind was pleas'd with her  And she with all mankind  And likewise this Epigram upon another lady of the same character  Chloe her gossips entertains  With stories of her childbed pains  And fiercly against Hymen rails  But Hymen's not so much to blame  She knows unless her memory fails  E'er she was wed 'twas much the same  The following verses which breathe a true spirit of tenderness were written by her on her deathbed at Bath when her husband was in London  Thou who dost all my worldly thoughts employ  Thou pleasing source of all my earthly joy  Thou tenderest husband and thou best of friends  To thee this first this last adieu I send  At length the conqueror death asserts his right  And will forever veil me from thy sight  He wooes me to him with a chearful grace  And not one terror clouds his meagre face  He promises a lasting rest from pain  And shews that all life's fleeting joys are vain  Th' eternal scenes of Heaven he sets in view  And tells me that no other joys are true  But love fond love would yet resist his power  Would fain awhile defer the parting hour  He brings the mourning image to my eyes  And would obstruct my journey to the skies  But say thou dearest thou unwearied friend  Say should'st thou grieve to see my sorrows end  Thou know'st a painful pilgrimage I have past  And should'st thou grieve that rest is come at last  Rather rejoice to see me shake off life  And die as I have liv'd thy faithful wife  Mr THOMAS BROWN  THIS humorous poet was the son of a considerable Farmer of Shiffnall in Shropshire and educated at Newportschool in that county under the reverend and learned Dr Edwards a gentleman who had the honour to qualify many persons of distinction for the university Under the tuition of this master he attained a knowledge of the Latin Greek French Italian and Spanish languages and his exercises were generally so well performed that the Dr was filled with admiration of his parts From Newport school he removed to Christ'sChurch College in Oxford and distinguished himself there for his easy attainments in literature but some little irregularities of his life would not suffer him to continue long at the university It is probable he became sick of that discipline which they who spend their life in the recluseness of a college are in some measure obliged to submit to The father of Mr Brown who intended to have him educated to some profession was not made acquainted with his design of quitting the university and having remitted him a sum of money to be appropriated for the promotion of his studies his son thought proper to defeat his kind intentions  With this money our author plann'd a scheme of going to London which he soon after executed not very advantageously  'My first business says he was to apply myself to those few friends I had there who conjecturing I had left the university exclusive of my father's knowledge gave but slender encouragement to a young  beginner However no whit daunted my first resolution still standing by me I launched forth into the world committing myself to the mercy of fortune and the uncertain temper of the town I soon acquired a new sett of acquaintance and began to have a relish of what I had only tasted before by hearsay and indeed every thing served to convince me I had changed for the better except that my slender subsistance began to waste extremely and ruminating upon the difficulty of obtaining a supply I was then laid under the necessity of thinking what course to steer I knew how justly I had incurred the displeasure of an indulgent father and how far I had put myself from retrieving his favour Amidst this serous contemplation I resolved to go through stitch with my enterprize let what will come on't However that I might use discretion to palliate an unforeseen event I determined 'twere better to trust to the flexibility of a father's temper than to lay too great a stress upon the humanity of fortune who would let a man of morals starve if he depended on her favours Therefore without more ado having taken my sorrowful leave of my last guinea and reduced Carolus Secundus from a whole number to decimal fractions I dispatched a letter into the country full of excuse and penitence baited with all the submissive eloquence imaginable In the mean time I was no less sedulous to find out some employment that might suit with my genius and with my dependancies at home render my life easy'  Whether his father was touched by the epistle which our author in consequence of this resolution wrote to him we cannot ascertain as there is no mention made of it Soon after this we find him school master of Kingston upon Thames and happy for him had he continued in that more certain employment  and not have so soon exchanged it for beggary and reputation Mr Brown impatient of a recluse life quitted the school and came again to London and as he found his old companions more delighted with his wit than ready to relieve his necessities he had recourse to scribbling for bread which he performed with various success Dr Drake who has written a defence of our author's character prefixed to his works informs us that the first piece which brought him into reputation was an account of the conversion of Mr Bays in a  ialogue which met with a reception suitable to the wit spirit and learning of it  ut though this raised his fame yet it added very little to his profit For though it made his company exceedingly covet  d and might have recommended him to the great as well as to the ingenious yet he was of a temper not to chuse his acquaintance by interest and slighted such an opportunity of recommending himself to the powerful and opulent as if wisely improved might have procured him dignities and preferments The stile of this dialogue was like that of his ordinary conversation lively and facetious It discovered no small erudition but managed with a great deal of humour in a burlesque way which make both the reasoning and the extensive reading which are abundantly shewn in it extremely surprizing and agreeable The same manner and humour runs through all his writings whether Dialogues Letters or Poems  The only considerable objection which the critics have made to his works is that they want delicacy But in answer to this it may be affirmed that there is as much refinement in his works as the nature of humorous satire which is the chief beauty of his compositions will admit for as satire requires strong ideas the language will sometimes be less polished But the delicacy so  much demanded by softening the colours weakens the drawing Mr Brown has been charged with inequality in his writings which is inseparable from human  ty  Our author's letters though written carelesly to private friends bear the true stamp and image of a genius The variety of his learning may be seen in the Lacedaemonian Mercury where abundance of critical questions of great nicety are answered with much solidity and judgment as well as wit and humour But that design exposing him too much to the scruples of the grave and reserved as well as to the censure and curiosity of the impertinent he soon discontinued it Besides as this was a periodical work he who was totally without steadiness was very ill qualified for such an undertaking When the press called upon him for immediate supply he was often found debauching himself at a tavern and by excessive drinking unable to perform his engagements with the public by which no doubt the work considerably suffered  But there is yet another reason why Mr Brown has been charged with inequality in his writings viz that most of the anonymous pieces which happened to please the town were fathered upon him This though in reality an injury to him is yet a proof of the universality of his reputation when whatever pleased from an unknown hand was ascribed to him but by these means he was reputed the writer of many things unworthy of him In poetry he was not the author of any long piece for he was quite unambitious of reputation of that kind They are generally Odes Satires and Epigrams and are certainly not the best part of his works His Translations in Prose are many and of various kinds His stile is strong and masculine and if he was not so nice in the choice of his authors as might be expected from a man of his taste he  must be excused for he performed his translations as a task prescribed him by the Booksellers from whom he derived his chief support It was the misfortune of our author to appear on the stage of the world when fears and jealousies had soured the tempers of men and politics and polemics had almost driven mirth and good nature out of the nation so that the careless gay humour and negligent chearful wit which in former days of tranquility would have recommended him to the conversation of princes was in a gloomy period lost upon a people incapable of relishing genuine humour  An anonymous author who has given the world some account of Mr Brown observes  'that it was not his immorality that hindered him from climbing to the top of poetry and preferment but that he had a particular way of sinning to himself To speak in plain English says he Tom Brown had less the spirit of a gentleman than the rest of the Wits and more of a Scholar Tom thoughts himself as happy with a retailer of damnation in an obscure hole as another to have gone to the devil with all the splendour of a fine equipage 'Twas not the brightness of Caelia's eyes nor her gaudy trappings that attracted his heart Cupid might keep his darts to himself Tom always carried his fire about him If she had but a mouth two eyes and a nose he never enquired after the regularity of her dress or features He always brought a good stomach with him and used but little ceremony in the preface As of his mistresses so he was very negligent in the choice of his companions who were sometimes mean and despicable a circumstance which never fails to ruin a man's reputation He was of a lazy temper and the Booksellers who gave him credit enough as to his capacity had no confidence to put in his  diligence'  The same gentleman informs us that though Tom Brown was a goodnatured man yet he had one pernicious quality which eternally procured him enemies and that was rather to lose his friend than his joke  One of his lampoons had almost cost him a procession at the cart's tail nor did he either spare friend or foe if the megrim of abuse once seized him He had a particular genius for scandal and dealt it out liberally when he could find occasion He is famed for being the author of a Libel fixed one Sunday morning on the doors of Westminsterabbey and many others against the clergy and quality As for religion Brown never professed any and used to say that he understood the world better than to have the imputation of righteousness laid to his charge and the world to be even with him really thought him an Atheist But though Brown never made any professions of religion yet it proceeded more from affectation than conviction When he came upon his deathbed he expressed remorse for his past life and discovered at that period sentiments which he had never before suffered to enter his mind This penitential behaviour in the opinion of some was the occasion why all his brethren neglected him and did not bestow on his memory one elegiac song nor any of the rites of verse We find no encomiums upon him but what appeared in a Grubstreet Journal which however are much superior to what was usually to be found there  A mournful muse from Albion swains produce  Sad as the song a gloomy genius chuse  In artful numbers let his wit be shewn  And as he sings of Doron's speak his own  Such be the bard for only such is sit  To trace pale Doron thro' the fields of wit  Towards the latter end of our author's life we are informed by Mr Jacob that he was in favour with the earl of Dorset who invited him to dinner on a Christmasday with Mr Dryden and some other gentlemen celebrated for ingenuity according to his lordship's usual custom when Mr Brown to his agreeable surprize found a Bank Note of l under his plate and Mr Dryden at the same time was presented with another of l Acts of munificence of this kind were very common with that generous spirited nobleman  Mr Brown died in the year and was interred in the Cloyster of Westminsterabbey near the remains of Mrs Behn with whom he was intimate in his lifetime His whole works consisting of Dia  ogues Essays Declamations Satires Letters from the Dead to the Living Translations Amusements c were printed in vol mo In order that the reader may conceive a true idea of the spirit and humour as well as of the character of Tom Brown we shall here insert an Imaginary Epistle written from the Shades to his Friends among the Living with a copy of Verses representing the Employment of his poetical Brethren in that fancied Region  TOM BROWN to his Friends among the Living  GENTLEMEN  I Bear it with no little concern to find myself so soon forgot among ye I have paid as constant attendance to posthours in expectation to hear from ye as a hungry Irish Man at twelve to a threepenny ordinary or a decayed beau for nice eating to a roastingcook's No amorouskeeping fool banished from his Chloris in town to his country solitude has waited with greater impatience for a kind epistle from her than I for one from you I have searched all private packets and examined every stragling ghost that came from your parts without being able to get the least intelligence of your affairs This is the third since my arrival in these gloomy regions and I can give myself no reason why I have received none in answer unless the packetboat has been taken by the French or that so little time has quite excluded me from your memories In my first I gave you an account of my journey hither and my reception among the ingenious in these gloomy regions  I arrived on the Banks of Acheron and found Charon scooping his wherry who seeing me approach him bid me sit down a little for he had been hard worked lately and could not go with a single passenger I was willing enough to embrace the proposal being much fatigued and weary Having finished what he was about he cast his rueful aspect up to the clouds and demonstrating from thence as I suppose it was near dinnertime he took from out a locker or cupboard in the stern of his pinnace some provender pinned  up in a clean linnen clout and a jack of liquor and fell too without the least shew of ceremony unless indeed it were to off  r me the civility of partaking with him He m  ttered something to himself which might be g  ce as far as I know but if it were 'twas as short as that at an Auctiondinner nor did he devour what was before him with less application than I have seen some there For my part I could not but contemplate on his shaggy locks his wither'd sunburnt countenance together with the mightiness and sanctity of his beard but above all his brawny chopt knuckles employed my attention In short having sati  fied the cormorant in his guts he had time to ask me what countryman I was to which I submissively answered an Englishman O says he those Englishmen are merry rogues and love mischief I have sometimes a diverting story from thence What news have you brought with you truly I told his highness I came away a little dissatisfied and had not made any remarks on the world for some time before my death and for news I had not leisure to bring any thing of moment But ere we had talked much more we saw two other passengers approach us who by their often turning to one another and their laying down arguments with their hands seemed to be in warm debate together which was as we conjectured for when they drew nearer to us they proved to be a termagant HighFlyer and a puritanical Scripturian a fiery Scotchman Occasional Conformity was their subject for I heard the Scot tell him 'twas all popery downright popery and that the inquisition in Spain was christianity to it by retarding the sons of grace from partaking of the gifts of the Lord he said it was the bui  ding of Babel and they were confo  nded in the works of their hands by the confusion  of tongues such crys says he went forth before the desolation of the great city  Thou the son of grace says the other thou art a son of Satan and hast preached up iniquity ye are the evil tares and the land can never prosper 'till ye are rooted out from among the good corn  Thou art an inventer of lies said the disciple of John Calvin and the truth is not in thee ye are bloody minded wretches and your sury is the only sign of your religion as the steeple is to the church your organs are the prophane tinkling of the cimbals of Satan that tickle the ears with vanity  Thus the dispute lasted till they came to us and getting into the boat they jostled for preeminence which might have proved a sharp conflict had not the old fellow took up a stretcher and parted them After which we passed peaceably over to the other side being landed the Scot and I took our way together and left the furious churchman to vent his spleen by himself We had not travelled long before we came to a populous village where from the various multitude our eyes encountered at a distance we might easily conjecture that something more than ordinary had gathered them together in that manner it resembled as near as I can describe it that famous place called Sherrickfair or a StaffordshireWake While we were applying our admiration that way we arrived at a small hut erected for that purpose where Nero the tyrant like a blind fidler was surrounded by a confused tribe of all sorts and sexes like another Orpheus among the beasts  The various remarks I made some dancing some prancing some clapping some knapping some drinking some winking some kissing some pissing some reeling some stealing urged my curiosity to enquire for what it was possible those  noble sports might be ordained and was soon satisfied it was the Anniversary Feast of their Great Lady Proserpine's birthday But these things that I took to be diverting so elevated the spleen of my Puritan companion that he began loudly to exclaim agninst those prophane exercises he said they were impure and lifted up the mind to lewdness that those that followed them were the sons of Belial and wore the mark of the beast in their foreheads I endeavoured to pacify the sanctified brother by putting h  m in mind where we were and that his rashness might draw us into danger being in a strange place but all was in vain I but stirred up his fury more for turning his rebukes upon me he told me I was myself one of the w  cked and did rejoice in my heart at the de  ds of darkness no says he I will not be pacified I will roar aloud to drown their incantations yea I will set out a throat even as the beast that belloweth so that perceiving the mob gather about him I thought it prudence to steal off and leave him to the fury of those whose displeasure he was about to incur  I had not gone far but I'spied two brawney champions at a rubbers of cuffs which by the dexterity of their heads hands and heels I judged could be no other than Englishmen nor were my sentiments groundless for presently I heard the mob cry out O rare Jo O rare Jo and att  ntively surveying the combatants I found it to be the merry Jo Haynes fallen out with Plowden the famous Lawyer about a game at Nineholes and that shout had proclaimed Joe victorious I was something scrupulous of renewing my acquaintance not knowing how the conqueror in the midst of his success might use me for making bold with his character in my letters from the dead though I felt a secret desire to discover myself yet prudence withstood my inclination  'till a more convenient season might offer so that I brushed off to a place where I saw a conc  urse of the better sort of people there I found Millington the famous Auctioneer among a crowd of Lawyers Physicians Scholars Poets Critics Booksellers c exercising his old faculty for which gentlemen he is as particularly famed in these parts as Herostratus for firing the famous Temple or Barthol Swarts for the invention of Gunpowder He is head journeyman to Ptolomy who keeps a Bookseller's shop here and rivals even Jacob Tonson in reputation among the great wits  But most of all I was obliged to admire my friend Millington who by his powerful knack of eloquence to the wonder of the whole company sold Cave's Lives of the Fathers to Solomon the Magnificent and the Scotch Directory to the Priests of the Sun nay he sold Archbishop Laud's Life to Hugh Peters Hob's Leviathan to Pope Boniface and pop'd Bunyan's Works upon Bellarmine for a piece of unrevealed Divinity After the sale was over I took an opportunity of making myself known to him who caressed me with all the freedom imaginable asking me how long I had been in these parts and what news from the other world and a thousand particular questions about his old friends to all which I responded as well as I could and having given me a caution to avoid some people by whom I was threatened for exposing them in my letters we went to take a bottle together  Now I presume gentlemen you will conclude it high time for me to take my leave nor shall I tire your patience much longer only permit me to give ye the trouble of some particular services to those honest gentlemen whose generosity gave me the reputation of a funeral above what I e'er expected  especially to Dr St for bestowing the ground I never frequented to Dr Garth and the rest for the charge of a hearse and mourning coaches which I could not have desired and to Dr Dke for designing me a monument I know the world will reflect I never deserved but for that let my works testify for me And though ye are satisfied my genius was never overfruitful in the product of verse yet knowing these favours require something a little uncommon to make a suitable return I shall take my leave in metre and if contrary to my opinion it meets with a kind acceptance from the town honest Sam may clap it in the next edition of the State Poems with Buckingham's name to it  When a scurvy disease had lain hold of my carcase  And death to my chamber was mounting the staircase  I call'd to remembrance the sins I'd committed  Repented and thought I'd for Heaven been fitted  But alas there is still an old proverb to cross us  I found there no room for the sons of Parnassus  And therefore contented like others to fare  To the shades of Elizium I strait did repair  Where Dryden and other great wits o' the town  To reward all their labours are damn'd to write on  Here Johnson may boast of his judgment and plot  And Otway of all the applause that he got  Loose Eth'ridge presume on his stile and his wit  And Shadwell of all the dull plays he e'r writ  Nat Lee here may boast of his bombast and rapture  And Buckingham rail to the end of the chapter  Lewd Rochester lampoon the King and the court  And Sidley and others may cry him up for't  Sost Waller and Suckling chaste Cowley and others  With Beaumont and Fletcher poetical brothers  May here scribble on with pretence to the bays  E'en Shakespear himself may produce all his plays  And not get for whole pages one mouth full of praise  To avoid this disaster while Congreve reforms  His muse and his morals fly to Bracegirdle's arms  Let Vanbrugh no more plotless plays e'er impose  Stuft with satire and smut to ruin the house  Let Rowe if he means to maintain his applause  Write no more such lewd plays as his Penitent was  O Satire from errors instruct the wild herd  Bestow thy advice to reclaim each lewd bard  Bid the Laureat sincerely reflect on the matter  Bid Dennis drink less but bid him write better  Bid Durfey cease scribbling that libelling songster  Bid Gildon and Cn be Deists no longer  Bid Br and Cr those wits of the age  Ne'er expose a dull coxcomb but just on the stage  Bid Farquhar tho'bit to his consort be just  And Motteux in his office be true to his trust  Bid Duffet and Cowper no longer be mad  But Parsons and Lawyers mind each their own trade  To Grubster and others bold satire advance  Bid Ayliffe talk little and Ps talk sense  Bid Kn leave stealing as well as the rest  When this can be done they may hope to be blest  The Revd Mr JOHN POMFRET  THIS Gentleman's works are held in very great esteem by the common readers of poetry it is thought as unfashionable amongst people of inferior life not to be possessed of the poems of Pomfret as amongst persons of taste not to have the works of Pope in their libraries The subjects upon which Pomfret wrote were popular his versification is far from being unmusical and as there is little force of thinking in his writings they are level to the capacities of those who admire them  Our author was son of the rev Mr Pomfret rector of Luton in Bedfordshire and he himself was preferred to the living of Malden in the same county He was liberally educated at an eminent grammar school in the country from whence he was sent to the university of Cambridge but to what college is not certain There he wrote most of his poetical pieces took the degree of master of arts and very early accomplished himself in most kinds of polite literature A gentleman who writes under the name of Philalethes and who was an intimate friend of Pomfret's has cleared his reputation from the charge of fanaticism which some of his malicious enemies brought against him It was shortly after his leaving the university that he was preferred to the living of Malden abovementioned and was says that gentleman  so far from being tinctured with fanaticism that I have often heard him express his abhorrence of the destructive tenets maintained by that people both against our religious and civil rights This imputation it seems was cast on him by there having been one of his surname though not any way related to him a dissenting teacher and who published some rhimes upon spiritual subjects as he called them and which sufficiently proved him an enthusiast  About the year Mr Pomfret came up to London for institution and induction into a very considerable living but was retarded for some time by a disgust taken by dr Henry Compton then bishop of London at these four lines in the close of his poem entitled The Choice  And as I near approach'd the verge of life  Some kind relation for I'd have no wife  Should take upon him all my worldly care  While I did for a better state prepare  The parenthesis in these verses was so maliciously represented to the bishop that his lordship was given to understand it could bear no other construction than that Mr Pomfret preferred a mistress before a wife though the words may as well admit of another meaning and import no more than the preference of a single life to marriage unless the gentlemen in orders will assert that an unmarried Clergyman cannot live without a mistress But the bishop was soon convinced that this aspersion against him was no more than an effort of malice as Mr Pomfret at that time was really married The opposition which his enemies made to him had in some measure its effect for by the obstructions he met with he was obliged to stay longer in London than he intended and as the Smallpox then raged in the metropolis he sickened of  them and died in London in the th year of his age  The abovementioned friend of Mr Pomfret has likewise shewn the ungenerous treatment he met with in regard to his poetical compositions in a book entitled Poems by the Earl of Roscommon and Mr Duke printed in the preface to which the publisher has peremptorily inserted the following paragraph  'In this collection says he of my lord Roscommon's poems care has been taken to insert all I possibly could procure that are truly genuine there having been several things published under his name which were written by others the authors of which I could set down if it were material 'Now says the gentleman this arrogant editor would have been more just both to the publ  c and to the earl of Roscommon's memory in telling us what things had been published under his lordship's name by others than by concealing the authors of any such gross impositions Instead of which he is so much a stranger to impartiality that he has been guilty of the very crime he exclaims against for he has not only attributed the prospect of death to the earl of Roscommon which was wrote by Mr Pomsret after the decease of that lord but likewise another piece entitled the Prayer of Jeremy Paraphrased prophetically representing the passionate grief of the Jewish people for the loss of their town and sanctuary written by Mr Southcot a gentleman who published it in the year so that it is to be hoped in a future edition of the earl of Roscommon's and Mr Duke's poems the same care will be taken to do these gentlemen justice as to prevent any other person from hereafter injuring the memory of his lordship'  Mr Pomiret published his poems in the year to which he has prefixed a very modest and  sensible preface  'I am not so fond of fame says he as to desire it from the injudicious many nor as so mortisied a temper as not to wish it from the discerning few 'Tis not the multitude of applauders but the good fame of the applauders which establishes a valuable reputation'  His poetical compositions consist chiefly of  The Choice which we shall insert as a specimen  Cruelty and Lust an Epistolary Essay founded upon the famous Story which happened in the reign of King James II Kirk who was that Prince's general against the duke of Monmouth was sollicited by a beautiful lady in behalf of her husband who then lay under sentence of death The inhuman general consented to grant his fair petitioner her request but at no less a price than that of her innocence The lady doated on her husband and maintained a hard struggle between virtue and affection the latter of which at last prevailed and she yielded to his guilty embraces The next morning Kirk with unparalleled brutality desired the lady to look out at the window of his bedchamber when she was struck with the horrid sight of her husband upon a scaffold ready to receive the blow of the executioner and before she could reach the place where he was in order to take a last embrace her husband was no more  How far the lady may be justified in this conduct is not our business to discuss if it is called by the name of guilt none ever had more pressing motives and if such a crime could admit of an excuse it must be upon such an occasion  Several Epistles to his Friends under affliction  Upon the Divine Attributes  A Prospect of Death  Upon the General Conflagration and the ensuing Judgment There were two pieces of our author's published after his death by his friend Philalethes the first of these entitled Reason was wrote by him in the year when the debates concerning the doctrine of the Trinity were carried on with so much heat by the Clergy one against another that the royal authority was interposed in order to put an end to a controversy which could never be settled and which was pernicious in its consequences This is a severe satire upon one of the parties engaged in that dispute but his not inserting it amongst his other poems when he collected them into a volume was on account of his having received very particular favours from some of the persons therein mentioned The other is entitled Dies Novissima or the Last Epiphany a Pindaric Ode on Christ's second Appearance to judge the World In this piece the poet expresses much heartfelt piety It is animated if not with a poetical at least with so devout a warmth that as the Guardian has observed of Divine Poetry  'We shall find a kind of refuge in our pleasure and our diversion will become our safety'  This is all the account we are favoured with of the life and writings of Mr Pomfret A man not destitute either of erudition or genius of unexceptionable morals though exposed to the malice of antagonists As he was a prudent man and educated to a profession he was not subject to  the usual necessities of the poets but his sphere being somewhat obscure and his life unactive there are few incidents recorded concerning him If he had not fortune sufficient to render him conspicuous he had enough to keep his life innocent which he seems to have spent in ease and tranquillity a situation much more to be envied than the highest blaze of fame attended with racking cares and innumerable sollicitudes  The CHOICE  IF Heav'n the grateful liberty would give  That I might chuse my method how to live  And all those hours propitious fate should lend  In blissful ease and satisfaction spend  Near some fair town I'd have a private seat  Built uniform not little nor too great  Better if on a rising ground it stood  On this side fields on that a neighb'ring wood  It should within no other things contain  But what were useful necessary plain  Methinks 'tis nauseous and I'd ne'r endure  The needless pomp of gawdy furniture  A little garden grateful to the eye  And a cool rivulet run murm'ring by  On whose delicious banks a stately row  Of shady Lymes or Sycamores should grow  At th' end of which a silent study plac'd  Should be with all the noblest authors grac'd  Horace and Virgil in whose mighty lines  Immortal wit and solid learning shines  Sharp Juvenal and am'rous Ovid too  Who all the turns of love's soft passion knew  He that with judgment reads his charming lines  In which strong art with stronger nature joins  Must grant his fancy does the best excel  His thoughts so tender and express'd so well  With all those moderns men of steady sense  Esteem'd for learning and for eloquence  In some of these as fancy should advise  I'd always take my morning exercise  For sure no minutes bring us more content  Than those in pleasing useful studies spent  I'd have a clear and competent estate  That I might live genteely but not great  As much as I could moderately spend  A little more sometimes t' oblige a friend  Nor should the sons of poverty repine  Too much at fortune they should taste of mine  And all that objects of true pity were  Should be reliev'd with what my wants could spare  For that our Maker has too largely giv'n  Should be return'd in gratitude to Heav'n  A frugal plenty should my table spread  With healthy not luxurious dishes fed  Enough to satisfy and something more  To feed the stranger and the neighb'ring poor  Strong meat indulges vice and pamp'ring food  Creates diseases and inflames the blood  But what's sufficient to make nature strong  And the bright lamp of life continue long  I'd freely take and as I did possess  The bounteous author of my plenty bless  I'd have a little vault but always stor'd  With the best wines each vintage could afford  Wine whets the wit improves its native force  And gives a pleasant flavour to discourse  By making all our spirits debonair  Throws off the lees the sediment of care  But as the greatest blessing Heav'n lends  May be debauch'd and serve ignoble ends  So but too oft the Grape's refreshing juice  Does many mischievous effects produce  My house should no such rude disorders know  As from high drinking consequently flow  Nor would I use what was so kindly giv'n  To the dishonour of indulgent Heav'n  If any neighbour came he should be free  Us'd with respect and not uneasy be  In my retreat or to himself or me  What freedom prudence and right reason give  All men may with impunity receive  But the least swerving from their rule's too much  For what's forbidden us 'tis death to touch  That life might be more comfortable yet  And all my joys refin'd sincere and great  I'd chuse two friends whose company would be  A great advance to my felicity  Well born of humour suited to my own  Discreet and men as well as books have known  Brave gen'rous witty and exactly free  From loose behaviour or formality  Airy and prudent mer  y but not light  Quick in discerning and in judging right  Secret they should be faithful to their trust  In reas'ning cool strong temperate and just  Obliging open without huffing brave  Brisk in gay talking and in sober grave  Close in dispute but not tenacious try'd  By solid reason and let that decide  Not prone to lust revenge or envious hate  Nor busy medlers with intrigues of state  Strangers to slander and sworn foes to fpight  Not quarrelsome but stout enough to fight  Loyal and pious friends to Caesar true  As dying martyrs to their Maker too  In their society I could not miss  A permanent sincere substantial bliss  Would bounteous Heav'n once more indulge I'd chuse  or who would so much satisfaction lose  As witty nymphs in conversation give  Near some obliging modest fair to live  For there's that sweetness in a female mind  Which in a man's we cannot hope to find  That by a secret but a pow'rful art  Winds up the springs of life and does impart  Fresh vital heat to the transported heart  I'd have her reason all her passions sway  Easy in company in private gay  Coy to a fop to the deserving free  Still constant to herself and just to me  A soul she should have for great actions fit  Prudence and wisdom to direct her wit  Courage to look bold danger in the face  No fear but only to be proud or base  Quick to advise by an emergence prest  To give good counsel or to take the best  I'd have th' expression of her thoughts be such  She might not seem reserv'd nor talk too much  That shews a want of judgment and of sense  More than enough is but impertinence  Her conduct regular her mirth refin'd  Civil to strangers to her neighbours kind  A  rse to vanity revenge and pride  In all the meth  ds of deceit untry'd  So faithful to her fr  end and good to all  No censure might upon her actions fall  Then would e'en  nvy be compell'd to say  She goes the least of woman kind astray  To this fair creature I'd sometimes retire  Her conversation would new joys inspire  G  ve life an edge so keen no surly care  Would venture to assault my soul or dare  Near my retreat to hide one secret snare  But so divine so noble a repast  I'd seldom and with moderation taste  For highest cordials all their virtue lose  By a too frequent and too bold an use  And what would cheer the spirit in distress  Ruins our health when taken to excess  I'd be concern'd in no litigious jar  Belov'd by all not vainly popular  Whate'er assistance I had pow'r to bring  T' oblige my country or to serve my King  Whene'er they call'd I'd readily afford  My tongue my pen my counsel or my sword  Law suits I'd shun with as much studious care  As I would dens where hungry lions are  And rather put up injuries than be  A plague to him who'd be a plague to me  I value quiet at a price too great  To give for my revenge so dear a rate  For what do we by all our bustle gain  But counterfeit delight for real pain  If Heav'n a date of many years would give  Thus I'd in pleasure ease and plenty live  And as I near approach'd the verge of life  Some kind relation for I'd have no wife  Should take upon him all my worldly care  While I did for a better state prepare  Then I'd not be with any trouble vex'd  Nor have the evening of my days perplex'd  But by a silent and a peaceful death  Without a sigh resign my aged breath  And when committed to the dust I'd have  Few tears but friendly dropt into my grave  Then would my exit so propitious be  All men would wish to live and die like me  Dr WILLIAM KING  THIS ingenious gentleman was son of Ezekiel King of London He received the rudiments of his education in Westminsterschool under Dr Bushy and was removed from thence to Christ'sChurch in Oxford in Michaelmas term when at the age of eighteen He studied the civil law and practised it at Doctor'sCommons with very great reputation but the natural gaiety of his temper and the love of company betrayed him into those pleasures which were incompatible with his profession  Our author by the reputation of his abilities obtained a patron in the earl of Pembroke who upon his being appointed lord Lieutenant of Ireland press'd him to go over to that kingdom  Upon Dr King's arrival in Ireland his excellency appointed him judge advocate sole commissioner of the prizes and record keeper There he was well received and countenanced by persons of the most distinguished rank and could he have changed his disposition with the climate had then an opportunity of making his fortune but so far was he from improving this occasion to the purposes of his interest that he returned back to England with no other treasure than a few merry Poems and humorous Essays He was naturally of a courteous behaviour and very obliging His conversation was chearful and his wit pleasant and entertaining But at length he chiefly subsisted on his fellowship in Christ's Church College Before this  time he had published his most ingenious Poem called the Art of Cookery in imitation of Horace's Art of Poetry with some Letters to Dr Lister and others occasioned principally by the title of a book published by the Dr being the works of Apicius Coelius concerning the soups and sauces of the ancients with an extract of the greatest curiosities contained in that book Amongst his Letters is one upon the Denti Scalps or Toothpicks of the Antients Another contains an imitation of Horace Epist Book I being his invitation of Torquatus to supper And a third contains remarks on lord Grimston's play called the Lawyer's Fortune or Love in a HollowTree  At his leisure hours he wrote likewise The Art of Love an imitation of Ovid De Arte Amandi To which he prefixed an account of Ovid In the latter part of his life about the year he published an Historical Account of the Heathen Gods and Heroes for the use of Westminster and other schools for the better and more easy understanding of the Classics Besides these performances we likewise find three numbers of a project entitled the Transactioner or Useful Transactions Containing a great number of small pieces which it would be tedious here to enumerate  The design of this work was to ridicule Sir Hans Sloan's writings in the Philosophical Transactions of the RoyalSociety of which Dr Sloan was secretary This work of Dr King's which is now become very scarce is one of the severest and merriest Satires that ever was written in Prose    We have already observed that our author while in Ireland neglected the best opportunity of encreasing his fortune and the circumstance which occasioned it we find to be this He had contracted an intimacy which soon grew into friendship with judge Upton a man of the same temper with himself who delighted in retirement and poetical amusement He had a country villa  called Mountown near Dublin where he and Dr King used to retire and spend most of their time without any regard to their public offices and by these means neglecting to pay court to the lord lieutenant they fell under his displeasure These two poetical companions indulged no other thoughts but those of living and dying in their rural retreat Upon this occasion Dr King wrote a Pastoral Poem called Mully of Mountown Mully was the name of a RedCow which gave him milk whom he made the chief subject of his Poem which at that time the critics would have imposed upon the wor  d as a political allegory tho' this was a manner of writing with which the Dr was totally unacquainted  When Dr King after his return from Ireland had retired to live upon his fellowship at Oxford he was sollicited by the earl of Anglesey to come to town and undertake a cause of his then before the House of Lords in relation to some cruelties he was accused of using to his lady back'd by the violent prosecution of his motherinlaw the countess of Dorchester Upon this occasion the Doctor shook off the indolence of his nature and so strenuously engaged in the cause of his patron that he gained the reputation of an able lawyer as well as a poet He naturally hated business especially that of an advocate but when appointed as a delegate made a very discerning and able judge yet never could bear the fatigue of wrangling His chief pleasure consisted in trifles and he was never happier than when hid from the world Few people pleased him in conversation and it was a proof of his liking them if his behaviour was tolerably agreeable He was a great dissembler of his natural temper which was sullen morose and peevish where he durst shew it but he was of a timorous disposition and the least slight or neglect offered to him would throw him into a melancholy despondency He  was apt to say a great many illnatur'd things but was never known to do one He was made up of tenderness pity and compassion and of so feminine a disposition that tears would fall from his eyes upon the smallest occasion  As his education had been strict so he was always of a religious disposition and would not enter upon the business of the day till he had performed his devotion and read several portions of scripture out of the Psalms the Prophets and the NewTestament  It appears from his loose papers which he calls Adversaria that he had been such an assiduous student that before he was eightyears in the university he had read over and made reflections on twentytwo thousand books and manuscripts a few of which we shall give as specimen in order to let the reader into the humour and taste of our author  'Diogenes Laertius Book IThales being asked how a man might most easily brook misfortunes answered if he saw his enemies in a worse condition It is not agreed concerning the wisemen or whether indeed they were seven'  'There is a very good letter of Pisistratus to Solon and of the same stile and character with those of Phalaris'  'Solon ordained that the guardians of orphans should not cohabit with their mothers And that no person should be a guardian to those whose estate descended to them at the orphan's decease That no sealgraver should keep the seal of a ring that was sold That if any man put out the eye of him who had but one he should lose both his own That where a man never planted it should be death to take away That it should be death for a magistrate to be taken in drink'  'Solon's letters at the end of his life in Laertius give us a truer Idea of the man than all he has written before and are indeed very fine Solon's to Craesus are very genteel and Pitaccus's on the other side are rude and philosophical However both shew Craesus to have been a very good man These epistles give a further reason to believe that the others were written by Phalaris There is a letter from Cleobulus to Solon to invite him to Lindus'  'Bion used to say it was more easy to determine differences between enemies than friends for that of two friends one would become an enemy but of two enemies one would become a friend'  'Anacharsis has an epistle to Craesus to thank him for his invitation and Periander one to all the wifemen to invite them to Corinth to him after their return from Lydia Epimenides has an epistle to Solon to invite him to Crete under the tyranny of Pisistratus'  'Epimenides often pretended that he rose from death to life'  The above notes are sufficient to shew that he read the ancients with attention and knew how to select the most curious passages and most deserving the reader's observation  About the year the Dr published a piece called the British Palladium or a welcome of lord Bolingbroke from France Soon after this Dr Swift Dr Friend Mr Prior with some others of lord Bolingbroke's adherents paid a visit to Dr King and brought along with them the key of the Gazetteer's office together with another key for the use of the paper office The day following  this friendly visit the Dr entered upon his new post and two or three days after waited on his benefactor lord Bolingbrooke then secretary of state  The author of the Doctor's life published by Curl has related an instance of inhumanity in alderman Barber towards Dr King This magistrate was then printer of the Gazette and was so cruel as to oblige the Dr to sit up till three or four o'clock in the morning upon those days the Gazette was published to correct the errors of the press which was not the business of the author but a corrector who is kept for that purpose in every printingoffice of any consequence This slavery the Dr was not able to bear and therefore quitted the office The alderman's severity was the more unwarrantable as the Dr had been very kind in obliging him by writing Examiners and some other papers gratis which were of advantage to him as a printer Those writings at that juncture made him known to the ministry who afterwards employed him in a state paper called the Gazettee  About Midsummer the Dr quitted his employ and retired to a gentleman's house on Lambeth side the water where he had diverted himself a summer or two before Here he enjoyed his lov'd tranquility with a friend a bottle and his books he frequently visited lord Clarendon at Somersethouse as long as he was able It was the autumn season and the Dr began insensibly to droop He shut himself up entirely from his nearest friends and would not so much as see lord Clarendon who hearing of his weak condition ordered his sister to go to Lambeth and fetch him from thence to a lodging he had provided for him in the Strand over against Somersethouse where next day about noon he expired with all the patience and resignation of a philosopher and the true devotion of a christian but would not be persuaded  to go to rest the night before till he made such a will as he thought would be agreeable to lord Clarendon's inclinations who after his death took care of his funeral He was decently interred in the cloisters of WestminsterAbbey next to his master Dr Knipe to whom a little before he dedicated his Heathen GodsThe gentleman already mentioned who has transmitted some account of our author to posterity delineates his character in the following manner  'He was a civilian exquisitely well read a skillful judge and among the learned an universal scholar a critic and an adept in all sciences and languages expert and ourEnglish Ovid among the poets In conversation he was grave and entertaining without levity or spleen As an author his character may be also summ'd up in the following lines'  Read here in softest sounds the sweetest satire  A pen dipt deep in gall a heart goodnature  An English Ovid from his birth he seems  Inspired alike with strong poetic dreams  The Roman rants of heroes gods and Jove  The Briton purely paints the art of love  As a specimen of our author's versification we shall select a Poem of his called the Art of making Puddings published in his Miscellanies  I sing of food by British nurse design'd  To make the stripling brave and maiden kind  Delay not muse in numbers to rehearse  The pleasures of our life and sinews of our verse  Let pudding's dish most wholsome be thy theme  And dip thy swelling plumes in fragrant cream  Sing then that dish so fitting to improve  A tender modesty and trembling love  Swimming in butter of a golden hue  Garnish'd with drops of Rose's spicy dew  Sometimes the frugal matron seems in haste  Nor cares to beat her pudding into paste  Yet milk in proper skillet she will place  And gently spice it with a blade of mace  Then set some careful damsel to look to't  And still to stir away the bishop'sfoot  For if burnt milk shou'd to the bottom stick  Like overheatedzeal 'twould make folks sick  Into the Milk her flow'r she gently throws  As valets now wou'd powder tender beaus  The liquid forms in hasty mass unite  Both equally delicious as they're white  In shining dish the hasty mass is thrown  And seems to want no graces but its own  Yet still the housewife brings in fresh supplies  To gratify the taste and please the eyes  She on the surface lumps of butter lays  Which melting with the heat its beams displays  From whence it causes wonder to behold  A silver soil bedeck'd with streams of gold  THOMAS SPRAT Bishop of ROCHESTER  WAS descended from a very worthy though obscure family being the son of a private country minister but his great merit raised him to that eminent station in the church wherein he long presided and was deservedly accounted one of the most considerable of his time The Oxford antiquary informs us that on the th of January he was entered in WadhamCollege where he pursued his studies with the closest application and distinguished himself by his prudent and courteous behaviour  On the d of July Mr Sprat took his master of arts degree and the same day commenced doctor in divinity He had not long been in holy orders till he was introduced at court and by a happy power in conversation so attracted the regard of Charles the IId that he was considered as a man standing fair for preferment In broke out the Ryehouse Plot a relation of the particulars of which Charles the IId commanded Dr Sprat to draw up This the Dr in a letter to lord Dorset informs us he did with great unwillingness and would have been impelled by no other consideration that that of a royal command The reason he executed these orders with so much reluctance was because many of the most popular men in the nation were either concerned themselves or had some relations engaged so that an account of a plot thus  supported must expose he writer to partial or popular resentments  He requested the king that he might be permitted to spare some names and to represent the behaviour of others in as candid a light as possible in which request his majesty indulged him but notwithstanding all the candour he observed and the most dispassionate representation of facts yet his composing this relation was brought against him as a crime for which an opposite party endeavoured and had almost effected his ruin This work tho' finished in the year was not published till when it came into the world under the immediate direction of king James the IId It was no doubt in consequence of this court service that he was made dean of Westminster Anno and bishop of Rochester the year following Another step he took in the short reign of king James likewise exposed him to the resentment of that power which took place at the revolution which was his sitting in the ecclesiastical commission By this he drew upon himself almost an universal censure which he acknowledges to be just as appears by a letter he wrote upon that occasion to the earl of Dorset in the year which thus begins  'My Lord  'I think I should be wanting to myself at this time in my own necessary vindication should I forbear any longer to give my friends a true account of my behaviour in the late ecclesiastical commission Though I profess what I now say I only intend as a reasonable mitigation of the offence I have given not entirely to justify my sitting in that court for which I acknowledge I have deservedly incurred the censure of many good men and I wish I may ever be able to make a sufficient amends to my country for it'  His crime in this particular was somewhat alleviated by his renouncing the commission when he perceived the illegal practices they were going to put in execution His offences were streunously urged against him and had not the earl of Dorset warmly espoused his interest he had probably been stript of his ecclesiastical preferments His lordship charged the illconduct of both these affairs upon king James and his ministry and thereby brought the bishop's opponents to a perfect reconciliation with him  Notwithstanding this accommodation such was the inquietude of the times that his lordship had not long enjoyed this tranquility before there was hatched a most villainous contrivance not only to take away his life but the lives of archbishop Sancroft lord Marlborough and several other persons of honour and distinction by forging an instrument under their hands setting forth that they had an intent to restore king James and to seize upon the person of the princess of Orange dead or alive to surprize the tower to raise a mighty army and to bring the city of London into subjection This black conspiracy to murther so many innocent persons was by the providence of God soon detected and his lordship drew up and published an account of it under this title A Relation of the Wicked Contrivance of Stephen Blackhead and Robert Young against the Lives of several Persons by forging an Association under their Hands In two parts The first being a Relation of what passed at the three Examinations of his Lordship by a Committee of Lords of the PrivyCouncil The second being an Account of the two Authors of the Forgery printed in quarto in the year  His lordship was honourably acquitted and he ever after looked upon this escape as one of the most remarkable blessings of his life  'In such  critical times says he how little evidence would have sufficed to ruin any man that had been accused with the least probability of truth I do therefore most solemnly oblige myself and all mine to keep the grateful remembrance of my deliverance perpetual and sacred'  Hitherto we have considered Dr Sprat in his episcopal and public character in which if he fell into some errors he has a right to our candour as they seem rather to have proceeded from misinformation and excess of goodnature than any malevolent or selfish principle We shall now take a view of him as an author  His first appearance in that sphere was in the year when in concert with Mr Waller and Mr Dryden he printed a Pindarique Ode to the Memory of the most renowned Prince Oliver Lord Protector c printed in quarto which he dedicated to the reverend Mr Wilkin's then warden of WadhamCollege by whose approbation and request it was made public as the author designed it only for a private amusement This was an unfavourable circumstance for our author as it more particularly shews the fickleness of his disposition in statematters and gave him less credit with those parties he afterwards espoused  His next production in poetry was an Ode on the Plague of Athens which happened in the second year of the Pelopponesian war first described by Thucydides afterwards by Lucretius This Mr Sprat dedicated to his worthy and learned friend Dr Walter Pope The performance stood the test of the severest critics and in the opinion of the best judges the manner of his great original was judiciously imitated Soon after this he proceeded to give the public a specimen of his abilities in another kind and succeeded with the greatest applause which was his Observations on Monsieur de Serbiere's  Voyage into England written to Dr Wren professor of astronomy in Oxford printed in octavo in the year  Mr Sprat in the beginning of his letter acquaints the Dr with the motives of his engaging with Monsieur Serbiere  'Having now says he under my hands the history of the RoyalSociety it will be in vain for me to try to represent its design to be advantageous to the glory of England if my countrymen shall know that one who calls himself a member of that society has escaped unanswered in the public disgraces which he has cast on our whole nation'  In this performance Mr Sprat has given an undeniable proof that the strength and solidity of an English pen is infinitely superior to the gallant air of a French author who is sprightly without propriety and positive without truth  About two years after our author published his incomparable History of the Royal Society of London for the improvement of natural knowledge a work which has acquired him very great reputation and has ranked him with the most elegant and polite writers of that age Soon after this Mr Sprat lost his amiable and much esteemed friend Mr Abraham Cowley who by his will recommended to the care of his reverend friend the revising of all his works that were printed and the collecting of those papers which he had designed for the press This trust Mr Sprat faithfully discharged and to the new edition of Mr Cowley's Works he prefixed an account of his life and writings addressed to Mr Martin Clifford Happy is it for a good man when he has such a friend to close his eyes This is a desire peculiar to all and the portion of few to enjoy  For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey  This pleasing anxious being e'er resign'd  Left the warm precincts of the chearful day  Nor cast one longing lingring look behind  On some warm breast the parting soul relies  Some pious drops the closing eye requires  E'en from the tomb the voice of nature cries  Awake and faithful to her wonted fires  Elegy in a Country ChurchYard by Mr Grey    This life of Cowley by Dr Sprat has been esteemed one of the most elegant compositions in our language there are several extracts from it in our account of the life of that amiable Poet  These are the most material performances of Dr Sprat a man who was early introduced into an elevated station in life which he held not without enemies to his dying moments Villiers duke of Buckingham was his first patron who notwithstanding his fickleness and inconsistent levity never forsook him a circumstance which has induced many to believe that that nobleman owed much to the refinement of our author and that his Rehearsal had never been so excellent nor so pungent a satire had it not first passed under Dr Sprat's perusal  This learned prelate died of an apoplexy May the th at his episcopal seat in Bromly in Kent in the th year of his age and was interred in the AbbeyChurch of Westminster  As he lived esteemed by all his acquaintance as well as the clergy of his diocese so he died regretted by  them and indeed by all men of taste for it is the opinion of many that he raised the English tongue to that purity and beauty which former writers were wholly strangers to and which those who have succeeded him can but imitate  Mr Cooper in his ingenious work entitled the Life of Secrates speaks in a very different strain of the bishop's History of the Royal Society which he calls a  'Fustian History'  and adds that  'it was esteemed an excellent composition by the metaphorhunting mob of silly writings in Charles Il's reign'    The benevolence of our author is very conspicuous in his last will in favour of his widow and son in which he commands them to extend that beneficence to his poor relations which they always found from him and not to suffer any of those to want whose necessitous merit had shared in all the external advantages he possessed As he may be proposed considered meerly as a writer for an example worthy of imitation so in the character of a dignified clergyman he has likewise a claim to be copied in those retired and private virtues in those acts of beneficence and humility and that unaffected and primitive piety for which he was justly distinguished  CHARLES MONTAGUE Earl of HALLIFAX  WAS born the th of April and received the rudiments of his education at Westminsterschool From thence he was removed to TrinityCollege in Cambridge where by the brightness of his parts he was early distinguished and coming to town soon after the death of king Charles the IId he contracted an intimacy with the earl of Dorset Sir Charles Sedley and other wits of the age After the accession of king William and queen Mary having attached himself to the revolution interest he was sworn one of the council He served in parliament for the cities of Durham and Westminster at different times and distinguished himself by his speeches in the House of Commons on several important affairs He was constituted one of the lords commissioners of the treasury on the st of March and soon after sworn of the privycouncil In he was made chancellor and under treasurer of the exchequer  Collins's Peerage See Article Hallifax  In the year when the nation was distress'd by the illstate of the current coin of this kingdom he projected the new coining of the silver money and by his great prudence and indefatigable industry brought it to bear He likewise proposed the issuing exchequer bills to supply the great scarcity of money which has since been made use of to the great benefit of the nation On the th of February the House of Commons came to a resolution  'That it is the opinion of this house that the honourable Charles Montague  Esq  chancellor of the exchequer for his good services to this government does deserve his majesty's favour'  His next concern was the trade to the EastIndies the settlement of which had been long depending and was looked on as so nice and difficult that it had been referred to the king and council and from them to the parliament who on May the th ordered a bill for settling the trade to that place Mr Montague transacted this whole affair and by his industry and skill in touching the affections of the people raised two millions by only doubling the duties on pap  r parchment and salt which to have done b  any other means was at that time matter of the utmost difficulty These proofs of affection and zeal to his majesty's person and government induced the king to declare him first lord commissioner of the treasury and on the th of July appointed him one of the persons to whose fidelity and honour he reposed the trust of lords justices of England for the administration of government during his absence In the year his lordship resigned the place of first lord commissioner of the treasury having obtained a grant of the office of auditor of the receipts of the exchequer vacant by the death of Sir Robert Howard and on the th of December the same year was advanced to the dignity of baron Hallifax in the county of York  On the accession of queen Anne he was concerned in vindicating the memory of king William and on all occasions shewed a disinterested zeal in the service of his country He first projected the equivalent which was given to the Scots in order to promote the Union between the nations and without which it had never been effected And as his lordship first moved for appointing  commissioners to treat of an Union between the two kingdoms so he had not only a great share in that treaty as one of the commissioners but causing it to be ratified in parliament and answered with all the force of which he was master the various objections made against it And further to strengthen the interest of the Whigs which he thought was essentially connected with the protestant religion his lordship proposed the bill for the naturalization of the illustrious house of Hanover and for the better security of the succession of the crown in the protestant line which being pass'd into an act her majesty made choice of him to carry the news to our late sovereign and to invest his son with the ensigns of the most noble order of the Garter On his arrival at Hanover he was received with extraordinary marks of distinction and honour During his residence there the princeroyal of Prussia was married to his present majesty's sister and soon after that prince set out with his lordship for the confederate army Hallifax then went to the Hague where he laid the foundation of a stricter alliance between GreatBritain and the United Provinces On his return to England he was graciously received by the queen and continued in her favour till the change of the ministry in the year  On her majesty's death our author was one of the regency nominated by king George the st till his arrival who was no sooner possessed of the crown but he shewed him distinguising marks of his favour having so strenuously promoted his succession to the British throne He had his majesty's leave to resign his post of auditor of the exchequer to his nephew the honourable George Montague and after being made first lord commissioner of the treasury and sworn of the privycouncil he was advanced to the dignity of earl of Hallifax and  viscount Sunbury by letters patent bearing date the th of October and before the end of that year was installed one of the knights companions of the most noble order of the garter and made lord lieutenant of the county of Surry  Lord Hallifax died in the th year of his age on the th of May and on the th of the same month was interred in general Monk's vault in WestminsterAbbey leaving no issue his titles devolved on his nephew George late earl of HallifaxConsidered as a poet his lordship makes a less considerable figure than the earl of Dorset there is a languor in his verses which seems to indicate that he was not born with a poetical genius That he was a lover of the muses there is not the least doubt as we find him patronising the poets so warmly but there is some difference between a propensity to poetry and a power of excelling in it His lordship has writ but few things and those not of the utmost consequence  Among others are the following printed in Tonson's Minor Poets  Verses On the death of Charles the IId  An Ode on the Marriage of the Princess Anne and Prince George of Denmark  The Man of Honour occasioned by a Postscript to Penn's Letter  An Epistle to Charles earl of Dorset occasioned by King William's Victory in Ireland  Verses written for the toasting Glasses of the KitCatClub which consisted of persons of the first fashion who were in the interest of the house of Hanover These Verses are by far the compleatest of lord Hallifax's and indeed genteel compliments to the radiant beauties who were the chief toasts amongst the Whigs I shall here present the reader with them  DUCHESS of BEAUFORT  Offspring of a tuneful fire  Blest with more than mortal fire  Likeness of a mother's face  Blest with more than mortal grace  You with double charms surprize  With his wit and with her eyes  LADY MARY CHURCHILL  Fairest latest of the beauteous race  Blest with your parents wit and her first blooming face  Born with our liberties in William's reign  Your eyes alone that liberty restrain  DUCHESS of RICHMOND  Of two fair Richmonds diff'rent ages boast  Their's was the first and our's the brighter toast  Th' adorers offspring prove who's most divine  They sacrific'd in water we in wine  LADY SUNDERLAND  All nature's charms in Sunderland appear  Bright as her eyes and as her reason clear  Yet still their force to men not safely known  Seems undiscover'd to herself alone  MADAMOISELLE SPANHEIME  Admir'd in Germany ador'd in France  Your charms to brighter glory here advance  The stubborn Britons own your beauty's claim  And with their native toasts enroll your name  WILLIAM WYCHERLEY  Esq  THIS Gentleman was son of Daniel Wycherley of Cleve in Shropshire  Esq  and was born says Wood in the year  When he was about fifteen years of age he was sent to France in the western parts of which he resided upon the banks of the Charante where he was often admitted to the conversation of the most accomplished ladies of the court of France particularly madam de Montausieur celebrated by mons Voiture in his letters  Dennis's Letters vol i p    A little before the restoration of Charles the IId he became a gentleman commoner of queen's college in Oxford and lived in the provost's lodgings and was entered in the public library under the title of philosophiae studiosus in July He quitted the university without being matriculated having according to the Oxford antiquary been reconciled to the protestant religion which he had renounced during his travels probably by the perswas  on of those gay ladies with whom he conversed in France This circumstance shews how dangerous it is to engage in a debate with a female antagonist especially if that antagonist joins beauty with understanding  Mr Wycherley afterwards entered himself in the MiddleTemple but making his first appearance  n town in a reign when wit and gaiety were the favourite  distinctions he relinguished the study of the law and engaged in pursuits more agreeable to his own genius and the gallant spirit of the times  Upon writing his first Play entitled Love in a Wood or St James's Park and acted at the Theatreroyal in he became acquainted with several of the most celebrated wits both of the court and town and likewise with the duchess of Cleveland Mr Dennis in his Letters quoted above has given a particular relation of the beginning of his acquaintance with this celebrated beauty of the times which is singular enoughOne day Mr Wycherley riding in his chariot through St James's Park he was met by the duchess whose chariot jostled with his upon which she looked out of her chariot and spoke very audibly  "You Wycherley you are a son of a whore"  and then burst into a fit of laughter Mr Wycherley at first was very much surprized at this but he soon recovered himself enough to recollect that it was spoke in allusion to the latter end of a Song in his Love in a Wood  When parents are slaves  Their brats cannot be any other  Great wits and great braves  Have always a punk for their mother  During Mr Wycherley's surprize the chariots drove different ways they were soon at a considerable distance from each other when Mr Wycherley recollecting ordered his coachman to drive back and overtake the lady As soon as he got over against her he said to her  "Madam you was pleased to bestow a title upon me which generally belongs to the fortunate Will your ladyship be at the play to night Well she replied what if I should be there Why then answered he I will be there to wait on your ladyship though I disappoint  a fine woman who has made me an assignation So said she you are sure to disappoint a woman who has favoured you for one who has not Yes he replied if she who has not favoured me is the finer woman of the two Put he who will be constant to your ladyship till he can find a finer woman is sure to die your captive"  The duchess of Cleveland in consequence of Mr Wycher  ey's compliment was that night in the first row of the king's box in DruryLane and Mr Wycherley in the pit under her where he entertained her during the whole play and this was the beginning of a correspondence between these two persons which afterwards made a great noise in the town  This accident was the occasion of bringing Mr Wycherley into favour with George duke of Buckingham who was passionately in love with that lady but was illtreated by her and who believed that Mr Wycherley was his happy rival The duke had long sollicited her without obtaining any favour Whether the relation between them shocked her for she was his cousingerman or whether she apprehended that an intrigue with a person of his rank and character must necessarily in a short time come to the king's ears whatever was the cause she refused so long to admit his visits that at last indignation rage and disdain took place of love and he resolved to ruin her When he took this resolution he had her so narrowly watched by his spies that he soon discovered those whom he had reason to believe were his rivals and after he knew them he never failed to name them aloud in order to expose the lady to all those who visited her and among others he never failed to mention Mr Wycherley As soon as it came to the knowledge of the latter who had all his expectations from court he apprehended the consequences of  such a report if it should reach the King and applied himself therefore to Wilmot earl of Rochester and Sir Charles Sedley entreating them to remonstrate to the duke of Buckingham the mischief he was about to do to one who had not the honour to know him and who had not offended him Upon opening the matter to the duke he cried out immediately that he did not blame Wycherley he only accused his cousin  'Ay but they replied by rendering him suspected of such an intrigue you are about to ruin him that is your grace is about to ruin a man whose conversation you would be pleased with above all things'  Upon this occasion they said so much of the shining qualities of Mr Wycherley and the charms of his conversation that the duke who was as much in love with wit as he was with his cousin was impatient till he was brought to sup with him which was in two or three nights After supper Mr Wycherley who was then in the height of his vigour both in body and mind thought himself obliged to exert his talents and the duke was charmed to that degree that he cried out with transport and with an oath  'My cousin's in the right of it'  and from that very moment made a friend of a man he before thought his rival  In the year a comedy of his called the Gentleman DancingMaster was acted at the duke's Theatre and in his Plain Dealer was acted with general applause In his Country Wife was performed at the same Theatre These Plays raised him so high in the esteem of the world and so recommended him to the favour of the duke of Buckingham that as he was master of the horse and colonel of a regiment he bestowed two places on Wycherley As master of the horse he made him one of his equeries and as colonel of a regiment  a captain lieutenant of his own company King Charles likewise gave our author the most distinguishing marks of favour perhaps beyond what any sovereign prince had shewn before to an author who was only a private gentleman Mr Wycherley happened to be ill of a fever at his lodgings in BowStreet CoventGarden during his sickness the king did him the honour of a visit when finding his fever indeed abated but his body extremely weakened and his spirits miserably shattered he commanded him to take a journey to the south of France believing that nothing could contribute more to the restoring his former state of health than the gentle air of Montpelier during the winter season at the same time the king assured him that as soon as he was able to undertake that journey he would order fivehundred pounds to be paid him to defray the expences of it  Mr Wycherley accordingly went to France and returned to England the latter end of the spring following with his h  alth entirely restored The king received him with the utmost marks of esteem and shortly after told him he had a son whom he resolved should be educated like the son of a king and that he could make choice of no man so proper to be his g  vernor as Mr Wycherley and that for this service he should have fi  teenhundred pounds a year allotted him the King also added that when the time came that his office should cease he would take care to make such a provision for him as should set him above the malice of the world and fortune These were golden prospects for Mr Wycherley but they were soon by a cross accident dashed to pieces  Soon after this promise of his majesty's Mr Dennis tells us that Mr Wycherley went down to Tunbridge to take either the benefit of the waters or the diversions of the place when walking one day upon the wellswalk with his friend Mr Fairbeard  of Grey'sInn just as he came up to the bookseller's the countess of Drogheda a young widow rich noble and beautiful came to the bookseller and enquired for the Plain Dealer  'Madam says Mr Fairbeard since you are for the Plain Dealer there he is for you'  pushing Mr Wycherley towards her  'Yes says Mr Wycherley this lady can bear plain dealing for she appears to be so accomplished that what would be a compliment to others when said to her would be plain dealingNo truly Sir said the lady I am not without my faults more than the rest of my sex and yet notwithstanding all my faults I love plain dealing and never am more fond of it then when it tells me of a fault'  Then madam says Mr Fairbeard you and the plain dealer seem designed by heaven for each other In short Mr Wycherley acompanied her upon the walks waited upon her home visited her daily at her lodgings whilst she stayed at Tunbridge and after she went to London at her lodgings in HattonGarden where in a little time he obtained her consent to marry her This he did by his father's command without acquainting the king for it was reasonably supposed that the lady having a great independent estate and noble and powerful relations the acquainting the king with the intended match would be the likeliest way to prevent it As soon as the news was known at court it was looked upon as an affront to the king and a contempt of his majesty's orders and Mr Wycherley's conduct after marriage made the resentment fall heavier upon him For being conscious he had given offence and seldom going near the court his absence was construed into ingratitude  The countess though a splendid wife was not formed to make a husba  d happy she was in her nature extremely jealous and indulged it to  such a degree that she could not endure her husband should be one moment out of her sight Their lodgings were in Bowstreet CoventGarden over against the Cock Tavern whither if Mr Wycherley at any time went he was obliged to leave the windows open that his lady might see there was no woman in the company  This was the cause of Mr Wycherley's disgrace with the King whose favour and affection he had befo  e possessed in so distinguished a degree The countess settled all her estate upon him but his title being disputed after her death the expence of the law and other incumbrances so far reduced him that he was not able to satisfy the impatience of his creditors who threw him at last into prison so that he who but a few years before was flourishing in all the gaiety of life flushed with prospects of court preferment and happy in the most extensive reputation for wit and parts was condemned to suffer all the rigours of want for his father did not think proper to support him In this severe extremity he fell upon an expedient which no doubt was dictated by his distress of applying to his Bookseller who had got considerably by his Plain Dealer in order to borrow l but he applied in vain the Bookseller refused to lend him a shilling and in that distress he languished for seven years nor was he released 'till one day King James going to see his Pla  nDealer performed was so charmed w  th it that he gave immediate orders for the payment of the author's debts adding to that bounty a pension of l per annum while he continued in England But the generous intention of that Prince to him had not the designed effect purely through his modesty he being ashamed to tell the earl of Mulgrave whom the King had sent to demand it a full state of his debts He laboured under the weight of these difficulties 'till his father  died and then the estate that descended to him was left under very uneasy limitations he being only a tenant for life and not being allowed to raise money for the payment of his debts yet as he had a power to make a jointure he married almost at the eve of his days a young gentlewoman of l fortune part of which being applied to the uses he wanted it for he died eleven days after the celebration of his nuptials in December and was interred in the vault of CoventGarden church  Besides the plays already mentioned he published a volume of poems which met with no great success for like Congreve his strength lay only in the drama and unless on the stage he was but a second rate poet In his posthumous works in prose and verse were published by Mr Lewis Theobald at London in vo  Mr Dennis in a few words has summed up this gentleman's character  'he was admired by the men for his parts in wit and learning and he was admired by the women for those parts of which they were more competent judges'  Mr Wycherley was a man of great sprightliness and vivacity of genius he was said to have been handsome formed for gallantry and was certainly an idol with the ladies a felicity which even his wit might not have procured without exterior advantages  As a poet and a dramatist I cannot better exhibit his character than in the words of George lord Lansdowne he observes  'that the earl of Rochester in imitation of one of Horace's epistles thus mentions our author'  ' Of all our modern wits none seem to me  ' Once to have touch'd upon true comedy  ' But hasty Shadwel and slow Wycherley  ' Shadwel's unfinish'd works do yet impart  ' Great proofs of nature's force tho' none of art  ' But Wycherley earns hard whate'er he gains  ' He wants no judgment and he spares no pains  'Lord Lansdowne is perswaded that the earl fell into this part of the character of a laborious writer merely for the sake of the verse if hasty says he would have stood as an epithet for Wycherley and slow for Shadwel they would in all probability have been so applied but the verse would have been spoiled and to that it was necessary to submit Those who would form their judgments only upon Mr Wycherley's writings without any personal acquaintance with him might indeed be apt to conclude that such a diversity of images and characters such strict enquiries into nature such close observations on the several humours manners and affections of all ranks and degrees of men and as it were so true and perfect a dissection of humankind delivered with so much pointed wit and force of expression could be no other than the work of extraordinary diligence labour and application but in truth we owe the pleasure and advantage of having been so well entertained and instructed by him to his facility of doing it if it had been a trouble to him to write I am much mistaken if he would not have spared that trouble What he has performed would have been difficult for another but a club which a man of an ordinary size could not lift was a walking staff for Hercules To judge by the sharpness and spirit of his satires you might be led into another mistake and imagine him an illnatur'd man but what my lord Rochester said of lord Dorset is applicable to him the best good man with the worst natured muse As pointed and severe as he is in his writings in his temper he had all the softness of the tenderest disposition gentle and inoffensive to every man in his particular  character he only attacks vice as a public enemy compassionating the wound he is under a necessity to probe or grieving like a good natured conqueror at the occasions which provoke him to make such havock King Charles II a nice discerner of men and himself a man of wit often chose him for a companion at his leisure hours as Augustus did Horace and had very advantageous views for him but unluckily an amorous inclination interfered the lover got the better of the courtier and ambition fell a sacrifice to ove the predominant passion of the noblest mind Many object to his versification it is certain he is no master of numbers but a Diamond is not less a Diamond for not being polished▪'  Mr Pope when very young made his court to Mr Wycherley when very old and the latter was so well pleased with the former and had such an opinion of his rising genius that he entered into an intimate correspondence with him and submitted his works to Mr Pope's correction See the letters between Pope and Wycherley printed in Pope's works  NAHUM TATE  WAS born about the middle of the reign of Charles II in the kingdom of Ireland and there received his education He was a man of learning courteous and candid but was thought to possess no great genius as being deficient in what is its first characteristic namely invention He was made poet laureat to King William upon the death of Shadwell and held that place 'till the accession of King George I on whom he lived to write the first BirthDay Ode which is executed with unusual spirit Mr Tate being a man of extreme modesty was never able to make his fortune or to raise himself above necessity he was

translation of the Psalms in the life of Dr Brady This author died in the Mint was interred in St George's church Southwark and was succeeded in the laurel by Mr Eusden  Sir SAMUEL GARTH  THIS gentleman was descended from a good family in Yorkshire after he had passed through his school education he was removed to Peterhouse in Cambridge where he is said to have continued till he was created Dr of Physic July  Biog Brit p    In Dr Garth zealously promoted the erecting the Dispensary being an apartment in the college for the relief of the sick poor by giving them advice gratis and dispensing medicines to them at low rates This work of charity having exposed him and many other of the most eminent Physicians to the envy and resentment of several persons of the same faculty as well as Apothecaries he ridiculed them with peculiar spirit and vivacity in his poem called the Dispensary in Cantos which though it first stole into the world a little hastily and incorrect in the year yet bore in a few months three impressions and was afterwards printed several times with a dedication  to Anthony Henley esquire This poem gained our author great reputation it is of the burlesque species and executed with a degree of humour hardly equal'd unless in the Rape of the Lock  Our author's poetical character joined with his skill in his profession his agreeable conversation and unaffected good nature procured him vast practice introduced him to the acquaintance and established him in the esteem of most of the nobility and gentry Much about the same time he gave a distinguishing instance of his profound knowledge in his profession his perfect acquaintance with antiquity and correct taste in Roman eloquence by a Latin oration pronounced before the Faculty in WarwickLa  e September to the great satisfaction of the audience and the raising his own reputation as the college register testifies Pieces of this kind are often composed with peculiar attention to the phrase the sound of the periods in speaking and their effect upon the ear these advantages were by no means neglected in Dr Garth's performance but the sentiments the spirit and stile appeared to still greater advantage in the reading and the applause with which it was received by its hearers was ecchoed by those who perused it this instance is the more singular as few have been distinguished both as orators and poets  Clcero who was not heard by his cotemporaries with greater applause than his works are now read with admiration attempted poetry without success reputation in that kind of writing the Roman orator much desired but never could compose a line to please himself or any of his friends  Upon the death of Dryden in May by a very strange accident his burial  See Dryden's Life  came to depend on the piety of Dr Garth who caused the body to be brought to the College of Physicians proposed and encouraged by his generous example a subscription for defraying the expence of the funeral and after pronouncing over the corpse a suitable oration he attended the solemnity to WestminsterAbbey where at last the remains of that great man were interred in Chaucer's grave For this memorable act of tenderness and generosity those who loved the person or who honoured the parts of that excellent poet expressed much gratitude to Dr Garth He was one of the most eminent members of a famous society called the KitKat Club which consisted of above thirty noblemen and gentlemen distinguished by their zealous affection to the Protestant succession in the House of Hanover  History of the Stewarts vol ii p  October he was elected one of the Censors of the College of Physicians In respect to his political principles he was open and warm and which was still more to be valued he was steady and sincere In the time of lord Godolphin's administration nobody was better received of his rank than Dr Garth and nobody seemed to have a higher opinion of that minister's integrity and abilities in which he had however the satisfaction of thinking with the public  In when the Whig ministry was discarded and his lordship had an opportunity of distinguishing his own friends from those which were only the friends of his power it could not fail of giving him sensible pleasure to find Dr Garth early declaring for him and amongst the first who bestowed upon him the tribute of his muse at a time when that nobleman's interest sunk A situation  which would have struck a flatterer dumb There were some to whom this testimony of gratitude was by no means pleasing and therefore the Dr's lines were severely criticised by the examiner a paper engaged in the defence of the new ministry but instead of sinking the credit either of the author or the verses they added to the honour of both by exciting Mr Addison to draw his pen in their defence In order to form a judgment both of the Criticism and the Defence it will be necessary first of all to read the poem to which they refer more especially as it is very short and may be supposed to have been written suddenly and at least as much from the author's gratitude to his noble patron as a desire of adding to his reputation  To the EARL of GODOLPHIN  While weeping Europe bends beneath her ills  And where the sword destroys not famine kills  Our isle enjoys by your successful care  The pomp of peace amidst the woes of war  So much the public to your prudence owes  You think no labours long for our repose  Such conduct such integrity are shewn  There are no coffers empty but your own  From mean dependence merit you retrieve  Unask'd you offer and unseen you give  Your favour like the Nile increase bestows  And yet conceals the source from whence it flows  So poiz'd your passions are we find no frown  If funds oppress not and if commerce run  Taxes diminish'd liberty entire  These are the grants your services require  Thus far the State Machine wants no repair  But moves in matchless order by your care  Free from confusion settled and serene  And like the universe by springs unseen  But now some star sinister to our pray'rs  Contrives new schemes and calls you from affairs  No anguish in your looks nor cares appear  But how to teach th' unpractic'd crew to steer  Thus like some victim no constraint you need  To expiate their offence by whom you bleed  Ingratitude's a weed in every clime  It thrives too fast at first but fades in time  The god of day and your own lot's the same  The vapours you have rais'd obscure your flame  But tho' you suffer and awhile retreat  Your globe of light looks larger as you set  These verses however they may express the gratitude and candour of the author and may contain no more than truth of the personage to whom they are addressed yet every reader of taste will perceive that the verses are by no means equal to the rest of Dr Garth's poetical writings Remarks upon these verses were published in a Letter to the Examiner September The author observes  'That there does not appear either poetry grammar or design in the composition of this poem the whole says he seems to be as the sixth edition of the Dispensary happily expresses it a strong unlaboured impotence of thought I freely examine it by the new test of good poetry which the Dr himself has established Pleasing at first sight Has this piece the least title even to that or if we compare it to the only pattern as he thinks of just writing in this kind Ovid is there any thing in De Tristibus so wild so childish so flat what can the ingenious Dr mean or at what time could he write these verses half of the poem is a panegyric on a Lord Treasurer in being and the rest a compliment of condolance to an Earl that has lost the Staff In thirty lines his patron is a river  the primum mobile a pilot a victim the sun any thing and nothing He bestows increase conceals his source makes the machine move teaches to steer expiates our offences raises vapours and looks larger as he sets nor is the choice of his expression less exquisite than that of his similies For commerce to run  The line here referred to was omitted in the later editions of these verses  passions to be poized merit to be received from dependance and a machine to be serene is perfectly new The Dr has a happy talent at invention and has had the glory of enriching our language by his phrases as much as he has improved medicine by his bills'  The critic then proceeds to consider the poem more minutely and to expose it by enumerating particulars Mr Addison in a Whig Examiner published September takes occasion to rally the fierce overbearing spirit of the Tory Examiner which he says has a better title to the name of the executioner He then enters into the defence of the Dr's poem and observes  'that the phrase of passions being poized and retrieving merit from dependence cavi'led at by the critics are beautiful and poetical it is the same cavilling spirit says he that finds fault with that expression of the Pomp of Peace among Woes of War as well as of Offering unasked'  This general piece of raillery which he passes on the Dr's considering the treasurer in several different views is that which might fall upon any poem in Waller or any other writer who has diversity of thoughts and allusions and though it may appear a pleasant ridicule to an ignorant reader is wholly groundless and unjust  Mr Addison's Answer is however upon the whole rather a palliation than a defence All the skill of that writer could never make that  poetical or a fine panegyric which is in its own nature removed from the very appearance of poetry but friendship good nature or a coincidence of party will sometimes engage the greatest men to combat in defence of trifles and even against their own judgment as Dryden finely expresses it in his Address to Congreve  " Vindicate a friend"  In Dr Garth wrote a dedication for an intended edition of Lucretius addressed to his late Majesty then Elector of Brunswick which has been admired as one of the purest compositions in the Latin tongue that our times have produced  On the accession of that King to the throne he had the honour of knighthood conferred upon him by his Majesty with the duke of Marlborough's sword  Chronol Diary for A D  He was likewise made Physician in ordinary to the King and Physician General to the army As his known services procured him a great interest with those in power so his humanity and good nature inclined him to make use of that interest rather for the support and encouragement of men of letters who had merit than for the advancement of his private fortune his views in that respect having been always very moderate He lived with the great in that degree of esteem and independency and with all that freedom which became a man possessed of superior genius and the most shining and valuable talents His poem entitled Claremont addressed to the duke of Newcastle printed in the th volume of Dryden's Miscellanies met with great approbation A warm admirer of the Doctor's speaking of Claremont thus expresses himself  'It will survive says he the noble structure it celebrates  and will remain a perpetual monument of its author's learning taste and great capacity as a poet since in that short work there are innumerable beauties and a vast variety of sentiments easily and happily interwoven the most lively strokes of satire being intermixed with the most courtly panegyric at the same time that there appears the true spirit of enthusiasm which distinguishes the works of one born a poet from those of a witty or learned man that has arrived at no higher art than that of making verse  Biog Britan p  '  His knowledge in philosophy his correct taste in criticism and his thorough acquaintance in classical literature with all the advantages that can be derived from an exact but concealed method an accurate though flowing st  le and a language pure natural and full of vivacity appear says the same panegyrist in the preface he prefixed to a translation of Ovid's Metamorphoses which would have been sufficient to have raised him an immortal reputation if it had been the only product of his pen  Dr Garth is said to have been a man of the most extensive benevolence that his hand and heart went always together A circumstance more valuable than all the lustre which genius can confer We cannot however speak of his works with so much warmth as the author just quoted seems to indulge His works will scarce make a moderate volume and though they contain many things excellent judicious and humorous yet they will not justify the writer who dwells upon them in the same rapturous strain of admiration with which we speak of a Horace a Milton or a Pope He had the happiness of an early acquaintance with some of the most powerful wisest and wittiest men of the age in which he lived he attached himself to a party  which at last obtained the ascendant and he was equally successful in his fortune as his friends Persons in these circumstances are seldom praised or censured with moderation  We have already seen how warmly Addison espoused the Dr's writings when they were attacked upon a principle of party and there are many of the greatest wits of his time who pay him compliments amongst the rest is lord Lansdowne who wrote some verses upon his illness but as the lines do no great honour either to his lordship or the Dr we forbear to insert them  The following passage is taken from one of Pope's Letters written upon the death of Dr Garth which we dare say will be more acceptable  'The best natured of men says he Sir Samuel Garth has left me in the truest concern for his loss His death was very heroical and yet unaffected enough to have made a saint or a philosopher famous But ill tongues and worse hearts have branded his last moments as wrongfully as they did his life with irreligion you must have heard many tales upon this subject but if ever there was a good christian without knowing himself to be so it was Dr Garth'  Our author was censured for his love of pleasure in which perhaps it would be easier to excuse than defend him but upon the whole his character appears to have been very amiable particularly that of his bearing a tide of prosperity with so much evenness of temper and his universal benevolence which seems not to have been cramped with party principles as appears from his piety towards the remains of Dryden  He died after a short illness January and was buried the d of the same month in the church of Harrow on the Hill in the county of Middlesex in a vault he caused to be built for himself and  his family  Chronol Diary A D  leaving behind him an only daughter married to the honourable colonel William Boyle a younger son

NICHOLAS ROWE  Esq  THIS excellent poet was descended from an ancient family in Devonshire which had for many ages made a very good figure in that county and was known by the name of the Rowes of Lambertowne Mr Rowe could trace his ancestors in a direct line up to the times of the holy war in which one of them so distinguished himself that at his return he had the arms given him which the family has born ever since that being in those days all the reward of military virtue or of blood spilt in those expeditions  From that time downward to Mr Rowe's father the family betook themselves to the frugal management of a private fortune and the innocent pleasures of a country life Having a handsome estate they lived beyond the fear of want or reach of envy In all the changes of government they  are said to have ever leaned towards the side of public liberty and in that retired situation of life have beheld with grief and concern the many encroachments that have been made in it from time to time  Our author was born at Little Berkford in Bedfordshire at the house of Jasper Edwards  Esq  his mother's father in the year  Welwood's preface to Rowe's Lucan  He began his education at a private grammarschool in Highgate but the taste he there acquired of the classic authors was improved and finished under the care of the famous Dr Busby of Westminster school where about the age of years he was chosen one of the King's scholars Besides his skill in the Latin and Greek languages he had made a tolerable proficiency in the Hebrew but poetry was his early bent and darling study He composed at different times several copies of verses upon various subjects both in Greek and Latin and some in English which were much admired and the more so because they were produced with so much facility and seemed to flow from his imagination as fast as from his pen  His father who was a Serjeant at Law designing him for his own profession took him from that school when he was about sixteen years of age and entered him a student in the Middle Temple whereof himself was a member that he might have him under his immediate care and instruction Being capable of any part of knowledge to which he thought proper to apply he made very remarkable advances in the study of the Law and was not content to know it as a collection of statutes or customs only but as a system founded upon right reason and calculated for the good of mankind Being afterwards called to the bar he promised as fair to make a figure in that profession  as any of his cotemporaries if the love of the Belles Lettres and that of poetry in particular had not stopped him in his career To him there appeared more charms in Euripides Sophocles and Aeschilus than in all the records of antiquity and when he came to discern the beauties of Shakespear and Milton his soul was captivated beyond recovery and he began to think with contempt of all other excellences when put in the ballance with the enchantments of poetry and genius Mr Rowe had the best opportunities of rising to eminence in the Law by means of the patronage of Sir George Treby Lord Chief Justice of the Common Pleas who was fond of him to a very great degree and had it in his power to promote him but being overcome by his propension to poetry and his first tragedy called the Ambitious Stepmother meeting with universal applause he laid aside all thoughts of the Law The Ambitious Step mother was our author's first attempt in the drama written by him in the th year of his age and dedicated to the earl of Jersey  'The purity of the language says Mr Welwood the justness of his characters the noble elevation of the sentiments were all of them admirably adapted to the plan of the play'  The Ambitious Stepmother being the first is conducted with less judgment than any other of Rowe's tragedies it has an infinite deal of fire in it the business is precipitate and the characters active and what is somewhat remarkable the author never after wrote a play with so much elevation Critics have complained of the sameness of his poetry that he makes all his characters speak equally elegant and has not attended sufficiently to the manners This uniformity of versification in the opinion of some has spoiled our modern tragedies as poetry is made to supply nature and declamation characters  Whether this observation is well founded we shall not at present examine only remark that if any poet has a right to be forgiven for this error Mr Rowe certainly has as his cadence is the sweetest in the world his sentiments chaste and his language elegant Our author wrote several other Tragedies but that which he valued himself most upon says Welwood was his Tamerlane acted at the Theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields and dedicated to the marquis of Hartington  In this play continues Welwood  'He aimed at a parallel between the late king William and Tamerlane and also Bajazet and a monarch who is since dead That glorious ambition in Tamerlane to break the chains of enslaved nations and set mankind free from the encroachments of lawless power are painted in the most lively as well as the most amiable colours On the other side his manner of introducing on the stage a prince whose chief aim is to perpetuate his name to posterity by that havock and ruin he scatters through the world are all drawn with that pomp of horror and detestation which such monstrous actions deserve And since nothing could be more calculated for raising in the minds of the audience a true passion for liberty and a just abhorrence of slavery how this play came to be discouraged next to a prohibition in the latter end of queen Anne's reign I leave it to others to give a reason'  Thus far Dr Welwood who has endeavoured to point out the similiarity of the character of Tamerlane to that of king William Though it is certainly true that the Tamerlane of Rowe contains grander sentiments than any of his other plays yet it may be a matter of dispute whether Tamerlane ought to give name to the play for Tamerlane is victorious and Bajazet the sufferer Besides the  fate of these two monarchs there is likewise contained in it the Episode of Moneses and Arpasia which is of itself sufficiently distressful to make the subject of a tragedy The attention is diverted from the fall of Bajazet which ought to have been the main design and bewildered in the fortunes of Moneses and Arpasia Axalla and Selima There are in short in this play events enough for four and in the variety and importance of them Tamerlane and Bajazet must be too much neglected All the characters of a play should be subordinate to the leading one and their business in the drama subservient to promote his fate but this performance is not the tragedy of Bajazet or Tamerlane only but likewise the tragedies of Moneses and Arpasia Axala and Selima It is now performed annually on the th and th of November in commemoration of the Gunpowder Treason and the landing of king William in this rea  m when an occasional prologue is spoken  Another tragedy of Mr Rowe's is the Fair Penitent acted at the Theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields and dedicated to the duchess of Ormond This is one of the most finished performances of our author The character of Sciolto the father is strongly marked Horatio's the most amiable of all characters and is so sustained as to strike an audience very forcibly In this as in the former play Mr Rowe is guilty of a misnomer for his Calista has not the least claim to be called the Fair Penitent which would be better changed to the Fair Wanton for she discovers not one pang of remorse till the last act and that seems to arise more from the external distress to which she is then exposed than to any compunctions of conscience She still loves and doats on her base betrayer though a most insignificant creature In this character Rowe has been true to the sex in drawing a woman as she generally is fond of her seducer but he has not  drawn a Penitent The character of Altamont is one of those which the present players observe is the hardest to represent of any in the drama there is a kind of meanness in him joined with an unsuspecting honest heart and a doating fondness for the false fair one that is very difficult to illustrate This part has of late been generally given to performers of but very moderate abilities by which the play suffers prodigiously and Altamont who is really one of the most important persons in the drama is beheld with neglect or perhaps with contempt but seldom with pity Altamont in the hands of a good actor would draw the eyes of the audience notwithstanding the blustering Lothario and the superior dignity of Horatio for there is something in Altamont to create our pity and work upon our compassion  So many players failing of late in the this character leaves it a matter of doubt whether the actor is most mistaken in his performance or the manager in the distribution of parts  The next tragedy Mr Rowe wrote was his Ulysses acted at the queen's Theatre in the HayMarket and dedicated to the earl of Godolphin This play is not at present in possession of the stage though it deserves highly to be so as the character of Penelope is an excellent example of conjugal fidelity Who though her lord had been ten years absent from her and various accounts had been given of his death yet notwithstanding this and the addresses of many royal suitors she preserved her heart for her Ulysses who at last triumphed over his enemies and rescued his faithful queen from the persecution of her wooersThis play has business passion and tragic propriety to recommend it  The next play Mr Rowe brought upon the stage was his Royal Convert acted at the queen's Theatre in the Haymarket and dedicated to the earl of Hallifax  His next was the Tragedy of Jane Shore writter in imitation of Shakespear's stile acted at the TheatreRoyal in DruryLane and dedicated to the duke of Queensberry and Dover How Mr Rowe could imagine that this play is written at all in imitation of Shakespear's stile we cannot conceive for so far as we are able to judge it bears not the least resemblance to that of Shakespear The conduct of the design is regular and in that sense it partakes not of Shakespear's wildness the poetry is uniform which marks it to be Rowe's but in that it is very different from Shakespear whose excellency does not consist merely in the beauty of soft language or nightingale descriptions but in the general power of his drama the boldness of the images and the force of his characters  Our author afterwards brought upon the stage his Lady Jane Grey dedicated to the earl of Warwick this play is justly in possession of the stage likewise Mr Edmund Smith of Ch  ist'sChurch author of Phaedra and Hyppolitus designed writing a Tragedy on this subject and at his death left some loose hints of sentiments and short sketches of scenes From the last of these Mr Rowe acknowledges he borrowed part of one and inserted it in his third act viz that between lord Guilford and lady Jane It is not much to be regretted that Mr Smith did not live to finish this since it fell into the hands of one so much above him as a dramatist for if we may judge of Mr Smith's abilities of writing for the stage by his Phaedra and Hyppolitus it would not have been so well executed as by Rowe Phaedra and Hyppolitus is a play without passion though of inimitable versification and in the words of a living poet  we may say of it that not the character but poet speaks  It may be justly said of all Rowe's Tragedies that never poet painted virtue religion and all the relative and social duties of life in a more alluring dress on the stage nor were ever vice or impiety better exposed to contempt and abhorrence  The same principles of liberty he had early imbibed himself seemed a part of his constitution and appeared in every thing he wrote and he took all occasions that fell in his way to make his talents subservient to them His Muse was so religiously chaste that I do not remember says Dr Welwood one wo  d in any of his plays or writings that might admit of a double meaning in any point of decency or morals There is nothing to be found in them to flatter a depraved populace or humour a fashionable folly  Mr Rowe's Plays were written from the heart He practised the virtue he admired and he never in his gayest moments suffered himself to talk loosely or lightly upon religious or moral subjects or to turn any thing sacred or which good men reverenced as such into ridicule  Our author wrote a comedy of three acts called the Biter It was performed at the Theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields but without success for Rowe's genius did not lie towards ComedyIn a conversation he had with Mr Pope that great poet advised him to rescue the queen of Scots from the hands of Banks and to make that lady to shine on the stage with a lustre equal to her character Mr Rowe observed in answer to this that he was a great admirer of queen Elizabeth and as he could not well plan a play upon the queen of Scots's story without introducing his favourite princess who in that particular makes but an indifferent figure he chose to decline it Besides he knew that if he favoured the northern lady there was a strong party  concerned to crush it and if he should make her appear less great than she was and throw a shade over her real endowments he should violate truth and incur the displeasure of a faction which though by far the minority he knew would be yet too powerful for a poet to combat with  The late duke of Queensberry when secretary of state made Mr Rowe secretary for public affairs and when that nobleman came to know him well he was never more delighted than when in his company After the duke's death all avenues were stopt to his preferment and during the rest of queen Anne's reign he passed his time with the Muses and his books and sometimes with the conversation of his friends  While Mr Rowe was thus without a patron he went one day to pay his court to the earl of Oxford lord high treasurer of England then at the head of the Tory faction who asked him if he understood Spanish well He answered no but imagining that his lordship might intend to send him into Spain on some honourable commission he presently added that in a short time he did not doubt but he should presently be able both to understand it and speak it The earl approving of what he said Mr Rowe took his leave and immediately retired out of town to a private country farm where within a few months he learned the Spanish tongue and then waited again on the earl to give him an account of his diligence His lordship asking him if he was sure he understood it thoroughly and Mr Rowe answering in the affirmative the earl burst into an exclamation  'How happy are you Mr Rowe that you can enjoy the pleasure of reading and understanding Don Quixote in the original'  This wanton cruelty inflicted by his lordship of raising expectations in the mind that he never intended to gratify needs only be told to excite indignation  Upon the accession of king George the Ist to the throne Mr Rowe was made PoetLaureat and one of the surveyors of the customs in the port of London The prince of Wales conferred on him the place of clerk of his council and the lord chancellor Parker made him his secretary for the presentations the very day he received the seals and without his asking it  He was twice married first to a daughter of Mr auditor Parsons and afterwards to a daughter of Mr Devenish of a good family in Dorsetshire By his first wife he had a son and by his second a daughter  Mr Rowe died the th of December in the th year of his age like a christian and a philosopher and with an unfeigned resignation to the will of God He preserved an evenness of temper to the last and took leave of his wife and friends immediately before his last agony with the same tranquility of mind as if he had been taking but a short journey  He was interred in WestminsterAbbey over against Chaucer his body being attended with a vast number of friends and the dean and chapter officiating at the funeral A tomb was afterwards erected to his memory by his wife for which Mr Pope wrote an epitaph which we shall here insert not one word of which is hyperbolical or more than he deserves  Epitaph on ROWE by Mr POPE  Thy reliques Rowe to this sad shrine we trust  And near thy Shakespear place thy honour'd bust  Oh next him skill'd to draw the tender tear  For never heart selt passion more sincere  To nobler sentiment to fire the brave  For never Briton more disdain'd a slave  Peace to thy gentle shade and endless rest  Blest in thy genius in thy love too blest  And blest that timely from our scene remov'd  Thy soul enjoys the liberty it lov'd  To these so mourn'd in death so lov'd in life  The childless parent and the widow'd wife  With tears inscribes this monumental stone  That holds their ashes and expects her own  'Mr Rowe as to his person was graceful and well made his face regular and of a manly beauty he had a quick and fruitful invention a deep penetration and a large compass of thought with a singular dexterity and easiness in communicating his opinions He was master of most parts of polite learning especially the Classic Authors both Greek and Latin he understood the French Italian and Spanish languages He had likewise read most of the Greek and Roman histories in their original languages and most that are written in English French Italian and Spanish He had a good taste in philosophy and having a firm impression of religion upon his mind he took delight in divinity and ecclesiastical history in both which he made great advances in the times he retired to the country which were frequent He expressed upon all occasions his full perswasion of the truth of revealed religion and being a sincere  member of the established church himself he pitied but condemned not those who departed from him he abhorred the principle of persecuting men on account of religious opinions and being strict in his own he took it not upon him to censure those of another persuasion His conversation was pleasant witty and learned without the least tincture of affectation or pedantry and his inimitable manner of diverting or enlivening the company made it impossible for any one to be out of humour when he was in it Envy and detraction seemed to be entirely foreign to his constitution and whatever provocation he met with at any time he passed them over without the least thought of resentment or revenge There were not wanting some malevolent people and some pretenders to poetry too that would sometimes bark at his best performances but he was too much conscious of his own genius and had so much goodnature as to forgive them nor could however be tempted to return them an answer'  This is the amiable character of Mr Rowe drawn by Mr Welwood to which we shall add the words of Mr Pope in a letter to Edward Blount  Esq  dated February the th  'There was a vivacity and gaiety of disposition almost peculiar to Mr Rowe which made it impossible to part with him without that uneasiness which generally succeeds all our pleasures'  It would perhaps be injurious to the memory of Rowe to dismiss his life without taking notice of his translations of Lucan and Quillet's Callipaedia the versification in both is musical and well adapted to the subject nor is there any reason to doubt but that the true meaning of the original is faithfully preserved throughout the whole These translations however with Mr Rowe's Occasional  Poems and BirthDay Odes are but little read and he is only distinguished as a dramatist for which we shall not pretend to assign a reason but we may observe that a Muse capable of produceing so many excellent dramatic pieces cannot be supposed to have executed any plan indifferently however it may charm a reader less than that kind of composition which is set off on the Theatre with so many advantages  He published likewise an edition of the works of Shakespear and prefixed the life of that great man from materials which he had been industrious to collect in the county where Shakespear was born and to which after he had filled the world with admiration of his genius he retired  We deem it unnecessary to give any specimen of Mr Rowe's poetry the most celebrated speeches in his plays which are beautifully harmonious are repeated by every body who reads poetry or attends plays and to suppose the reader ignorant of them would be to degrade him from that rank of intelligence without which he can be little illuminated by perusing the  Lives of the Poets  JOHN SHEFFIELD Duke of BUCKINGHAM  THIS nobleman who made a very great figure in the last age as an author a statesman and a soldier was born about the year He lost his father when he was about nine years of age and his mother soon after marrying lord Ossulton the care of his education was left entirely to a governor who though a man of letters did not much improve him in his studies  Character of the Duke of Buckingham p London  Having parted with his governor with whom he travelled into France he soon found by conversing with men of genius that he was much deficient in many parts of literature and that while he acquired the graces of a gentleman he was yet wanting in those higher excellencies without which politeness makes but an indifferent figure and can never raise a man to eminence  He possessed an ample fortune but for a while laid a restraint upon his appetites and passions and dedicated for some time a certain number of hours every day to his studies by which means he acquired a degree of learning that entitled him to the character of a fine scholar But not content with that acquisition our noble author extended his views yet farther and restless in the pursuit of distinction we find him at a very early age entering  himself a volunteer in the second Dutch war and accordingly was in that famous naval engagement where the duke of York commanded as admiral on which occasion his lordship behaved himself so gallantly that he was appointed commander of the royal Katherine a second rate man of war  His lordship in his own Memoirs tells us that when he entered himself a volunteer under his royal highness the duke of York he was then deeply engaged and under the soft influence of love He says he never shall forget the tenderness of parting from his mistress On this account double honour is due to himTo enter the bustle of war without any other call but that of honour at an age when most young noblemen are under the tuition of a dancing master argued a generous intrepid nature but to leave the arms of his mistress to tear himself from her he doated on in order to serve his country carries in it yet a higher degree of merit and ought to put all young men of fortune to the blush who would rather meanly riot in luxurious ease at home than do honour to themselves and their country by endeavouring to serve it  His lordship acknowledges in the abovementioned Memoirs that the duke of York did wonders in the engagement and that he was as intrepid in his nature as some of his enemies supposed him to be of an opposite character though says he alluding to what afterwards happened misfortunes age and other accidents will make a great man differ from himself We find our young nobleman while he was aboard a ship amidst the noise of the crew could yet indulge his genius for poetry One would imagine that the ocean is too boisterous an element for the Muses whose darling wish is for ease and retirement yet we find him amidst the roaring of winds and waves open his Poem with these soothing lines  Within the silent shades of soft repose  Where fancy's boundless stream for ever flows  Where the enfranchis'd soul at ease can play  Tir'd with the toilsome bus'ness of the day  Where princes gladly rest their weary heads  And change uneasy thrones for downy beds  Where seeming joys delude despairing minds  And where even jealousy some quiet finds  There I and sorrow for a while could part  Sleep clos'd my eyes and eas'd a sighing heart  Our author afterwards made a campaign in the French service  As Tangier was in danger of being taken by the Moors he offered to head the forces which were to defend it and accordingly he was appointed commander of them He was then earl of Mulgrave and one of the lords of the bedchamber to king Charles the IId In May he was installed knight of the Garter  As he now began to be eminent at court it was impossible but he must have enemies and these enemies being mean enough to hint stories to his prejudice in regard to some ladies with whom the king was not unconcerned his lordship's command was not made so agreeable as it otherwise would have been The particulars of this affair have been disputed by historians some have imagined it to refer to some celebrated courtezan whose affections his lordship weaned from the king and drew them to himself but Mrs Manly in her new Atalantis and Boyer in his History of queen Anne assign a very different cause They say that before the lady Anne was married to prince George of Denmark she encouraged the addresses which the earl of Mulgrave was bold enough to make her and that he was sent to Tangier to break off the correspondence  Mrs Manly in her Atalantis says many unhandsome things of his lordship under the title of count  Orgueil Boyer says some years before the queen was married to prince George of Denmark the earl of Mulgrave a nobleman of singular accomplishments both of mind and person aspired so high as to attempt to marry the lady Anne but though his addresses to her were checked as soon as discovered yet the princess had ever an esteem for him  This account is more probably true than the former when it is considered that by sending the earl to Tangier  General Dictionary See Article Sheffield  a scheme was laid for destroying him and all the crew aboard the same vessel For the ship which was appointed to carry the general of the forces was in such a condition that the captain of her declared he was afraid to make the voyage Upon this representation lord Mulgrave applied both to the lord admiral and the king himself The first said the ship was safe enough and no other could be then procured The king answered him coldly that he hoped it would do and that he should give himself no trouble about it His lordship was reduced to the extremity either of going in a leaky ship or absolutely refusing which he knew his enemies would impute to cowardice and as he abhorred the imputation he resolved in opposition to the advice of his friends to hazard all but at the same time advised several volunteers of quality not to accompany him in the expedition as their honour was not so much engaged as his some of whom wisely took his advice but the earl of Plymouth natural son of the king piqued himself in running the same danger with a man who went to serve his father and yet was used so strangely by the illoffices of his ministers  Providence however defeated the ministerial scheme of assassination by giving them the finest weather during the voyage which held three weeks  and by pumping all the time they landed safe at last at Tangier where they met with admiral Herbert afterwards earl of Torrington who could not but express his admiration at their having performed such a voyage in a ship he had sent home as unfit for service but such was the undisturbed tranquility and native firmness of the earl of Mulgrave's mind that in this hazardous voyage he composed the Poem part of which we have quoted  Had the earl of Mulgrave been guilty of any offence capital or otherwise the ministry might have called him to account for it but their contriving and the king's consenting to so bloody a purpose is methinks such a stain upon them as can never be wiped off and had that nobleman and the ship's crew perished they would have added actual murther to concerted baseness  Upon the approach of his lordship's forces the Moors retired and the result of this expedition was the blowing up of Tangier Some time after the king was appeased the earl forgot the ill offices that had been done him and enjoyed his majesty's favour to the last He continued in several great posts during the short reign of king James the IId till that prince abdicated the throne As the earl constantly and zealously advised him against several imprudent measures which were taken by the court the king some months before the revolution began to grow cooler towards him but yet was so equitable as not to remove him from his preferments And after the king lost his crown he had the inward satisfaction to be conscious that his councils had not contributed to that prince's misfortunes and that himself in any manner had not forfeited his honour and integrity  That his lordship was no violent friend to or promoter of the revolution seems to appear from his conduct during that remarkable aera  and particularly from the unfinished relation he left concerning it which was suppressed some years ago by order of the government  In a passage in his lordship's writings it appears he was unwilling that king James should leave England  Vol ii p  Just as the king was stepping into bed the night before his going away the earl of Mulgrave came into the bedchamber which being at so late an hour might possibly give the king some apprehensions of that lord's su  pecting his design with which he was resolved not to trust him nor any protestant He therefore stopped short and turned about to whisper him in the ear that his commissioners had newly sent him a very hopeful account of some accommodation with the Prince of Orange to which that lord only replied with a question asking him if the Prince's army halted or approached nearer to London the King owned they still marched on at which the earl shook his head and said no more only made him a low bow with a dejected countenance humbly to make him understand that he gave no credit to what the King's hard circumstances at that time obliged him to dissemble It also appears that the earl of Mulgrave was one of those lords who immediately after the King's departure sent letters to the fleet to the abandoned army of King James and to all the considerable garrisons in England which kept them in order and subjection not only to the present authority but that which should be settled afterwards  To his lordship's humanity was owing the protection King James obtained from the Lords in London upon his being seized and insulted by the populace at Feversham in Kent before which time says he  'the Peers sat daily in the council  chamber in Whitehall where the lord Mulgrave one morning happened to be advertised privately that the King had been seized by the angry rabble at Feversham and had sent a poor countryman with the news in order to procure his rescue which was like to come too late since the messenger had waited long at the council door without any body's being willing to take notice of him This sad account moved him with great compassion at so extraordinary an instance of worldly uncertainty and no cautions of offending the prevailing party were able to restrain him from shewing a little indignation at so mean a proceeding in the council upon which their new president the marquis of Hallifax would have adjourned it hastily in order to prevent him But the lord Mulgrave earnestly conjured them all to sit down again that he might acquaint them with a matter that admitted no delay and was of the highest importance imaginable Accordingly the Lords who knew nothing of the business could not but hearken to it and those few that guessed it and saw the consequence yet wanted time enough for concerting together about so nice and very important a matter as saving or losing a King's life The Lords then sat down again and he represented to them what barbarity it would be for such an assembly's conniving at the rabble's tearing to pieces even any private gentleman much more a great Prince who with all his popery was still their Sovereign so that mere shame obliged them to suspend their politics awhile and call in the messenger who told them with tears how the King had engaged him to deliver a letter from him to any persons he could find willing to save him from so imminent a danger The letter had no superscription and was to this effect'  'To acquaint the reader of it that he had been discovered in his retreat by some fishermen of Kent and secured at first there by the gentry who were afterwards forced to resign him into the hands of an insolent rabble'  'Upon so pressing an occasion and now so very publickly made known the council was surprized and under some difficulty for as there was danger of displeasing by doing their duty so there was no less by omitting it since the Law makes it highly criminal in such an extremity besides that most of them as yet unacquainted with the Prince of Orange imagined him prudent and consequently capable of punishing so base a desertion either out of generosity or policy These found afterwards their caution needless but at present it influenced the council to send of the life guards under their captain the earl of Feversham first to rescue the King from all danger of the common people and afterwards to attend him toward the sea side if he continued his resolution of retiring which they thought it more decent to connive at than to detain him here by force'  Whoever has the least spark of generosity in his nature cannot but highly applaud this tender conduct of his lordship's towards his Sovereign in distress and look with contempt upon the slowness of the council in dispatching a force to his relief especially when we find it was only out of dread lest they should displease the Prince of Orange that they sent any this shewed a meanness of spirit a want of true honour to such a degree that the Prince of Orange himself could not consistently with good policy trust those worshippers of power who could hear unconcerned that their late Sovereign was in the hands of a vile rabble and intreating them in vain for rescue  The earl of Mulgrave made no mean compliances to King William immediately after the revolution but when he went to pay his addresses to him he was well received yet did he not accept of a post in the government till some years after  May in the th year of William and Mary he was created marquis of Normanby in the county of Lincoln When it was debated in Parliament whether the Prince of Orange should be proclaimed King or the Princess his wife reign solely in her own right he voted and spoke for the former and gave these reasons for it That he thought the title of either person was equal and since the Parliament was to decide the matter he judged it would much better please that Prince who was now become their Protector and was also in itself a thing more becoming so good a Princess as Queen Mary to partake with her husband a crown so obtained than to possess it entirely as her own After long debates in Parliament the crown at last was settled upon William and Mary Burnet lord bishop of Salisbury whose affection for the revolution none I believe can doubt freely acknowledges that the King was resolved not to hold the government by right of his wife he would not think of holding any thing by apron strings' he was jealous of the friends of his wife and never forgave them and last of all he threatened to leave them in the lurch that is to retire to Holland with his Dutch army so restless says Mulgrave in another place is ambition in its highest scenes of success  During the reign of King William however he enjoyed some considerable posts and was generally pretty well in his favour and confidence April he was sworn Lord Privy Seal and the same year appointed one of the commissioners to treat of an union between England and Scotland and was made Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum for the North Riding  of Yorkshire and one of the governors of the Charterhouse  March he was created duke of Normanby having been made marquis of Normanby by King William and on the th of the same m  nth duke of  uckingham In he was made S  eward of her Majesty's Houshold and President of the Council and on her decease was one of the Lords Justices in Great Britain 'till King George arrived from Hanover  In the W  hig ministry began to lose ground and Mr Harley since earl of Oxford and the Lord Treasurer made the proper use of those circumstances yet wanting some assistance applied to the duke of Buckingham The duke who was not then on good terms with Mr Harley at first slighted his proposal but afterwards joined with him and others which produced a revolution in the ministry and shook the power of the duke and duchess of Marlborough while Mr Harley the earl of Shrewsbury lord Bolingbroke c came into the administration The duke was attached to Tory principles Her Majesty offered to make him chancellor which he thought proper to refuse He was out of employment for some time during which he did not so much as pay his compliments at court 'till he married his third wife and then went to kiss her Majesty's hand  The duke of Buckingham though reckoned haughty and ill natured was yet of a tender compassionate disposition but as the best characters have generally some allay he is allowed to have been very passionate but after his warmth subsided he endeavoured to a  one for it by acts of kindness and beneficence to those upon whom his passion had vented itself Several years before his grace died he was well known to have expressed some con  ern for the libertinism of his youth especially regarding the fair sex in which he had indulged  himself very freely He was survived only by one legitimate son but left several natural children  Our noble author has been charged by some of his enemies with the sordid vice of covetousness but without foundation for as a strong indication that he was not avaritious he lost a considerab  e part of his fortune merely by not taking the pains to visit during the space of years his estates at some distance from London and whoever is acquainted with human nature knows that indolence and covetousness are incompatible  His grace died the th of February in the th year of his age and after lying in state for some days at BuckinghamHouse was carried from thence with great funeral solemnity and interred in WestminsterAbbey where a monument is erected to his memory upon which the following epitaph is engraved by his own direction as appears from a passage in his will  'Since something is usually written on monuments I direct that the following lines shall be put on mine viz  'In one place  ' Pro Rege saepe pro Republica semper  'In another  ' Dubius sed non improbus vixi  ' Incertus morior sed inturbatus  ' Humanum est nescire errare  ' Christum adveneror Deo confido  ' Omnipotenti benevolentissimo  ' Ens Entium miserere mihi'  The words Christum adveneror are omitted at the desire of the late bishop Atterbury who thought them not strong enough in regard to Christ under the whole are the following words  Catharina Buckinghamicae Ducissa  Maerens extrui curavit Anno MDCCXXI  Edmund the duke's eldest son already mentioned was snatched away in his bloom a youth from whom the greatest things might have been expected as he was untainted with the vices of the age he was very remarkable for his modesty which vulgar minds imputed to want of powers but those who knew him best have given a different testimony concerning him and have represented him as possessed of all the genius of his father with more strict and inviolable morals With this young nobleman the titles of the Sheffield family expired  The duke his father informs us of a duel he was to have fought with the witty earl of Rochester which he thus relates after telling us that the cause of the quarrel happened between the first and second Dutch war  'I was inform'd says his grace that the earl of Rochester had said something very malicious of me I therefore sent colonel Aston a very mettled friend of mine to call him to account for it he denied the words and indeed I was soon convinced he had never said them But a mere report though I found it to be false obliged me as I then foolishly thought to go on with the quarrel and the next day was appointed for us to fight on horseback a way in England a little unusual but it was his part to chuse Accordingly I and my second lay the night before at Knightsbridge privately to avoid being secured at London on any suspicion which we found ourselves more in danger of there because we had all the appearance of highwaymen that had a mind to lye skulking in an odd inn for one night In the morning we met the lord Rochester at the place appointed who instead of James Porter whom he assured Aston he would make his second brought an errant lifeguardman whom nobody knew To this Mr  Aston took exception as being no suitable adversary especially considering how extremely well he was mounted whereas we had only a couple of pads upon which we all agreed to fight on foot But as my lord Rochester and I were riding into the next field in order to it he told me that he had at first chosen to fight on horseback because he was so weak with a certain distemper that he found himself unfit to fight at all any way much less a foot I was extremely surprized because no man at that time had a better reputation for courage and my anger against him being quite subsided I took the liberty to represent to him what a ridiculous story it would make should we return without fighting and told him that I must in my own defence be obliged to lay the fault on him by telling the truth of the matter His answer was that he submitted to it and hoped I would not take the advantage in having to do with any man in so weak a condition I replied that by such an argument he had sufficiently tied my hands upon condition I might call our seconds to be witnesses of the whole business which he consented to and so we parted Upon our return to London we found it full of this quarrel upon our being absent so long and therefore Mr Aston thought fit to write down every word and circumstance of this whole matter in order to spread every where the true reason of our returning without having fought which being not in the least contradicted or resented by the lord Rochester entirely ruined his reputation for courage though nobody had still a greater as to wit which supported him pretty well in the world notwithstanding some more accidents of the same kind that never fail to succeed one another when once people know a man's weakness'  The duke of Buckingham's works speak him a beautiful prose writer and a very considerable poet which is proved by the testimony of som  of the best writers his cotemporaries  His prose works consist chiefly of  Historical Memoirs Speeches in Parliament Characters Dialogues Critical Observations Speeches and Essays which with his poetical compositions were printed by Alderman Barber in in two splendid to volumes The first volume containing pi  ces in most species of poetry the epic excepted and also imitations from o  her authors His Grace wrote some Epigrams a great number of lyric pieces some in the elegiac st  ain and others in the dramatic Amongst his poems an Essay on Poetry which contains excellent instructions to form the poet is by far the most distinguished He wrote a play called Julius Caesar and another called Brutus or rather altered them from Shakespear  His grace was a great lover of the polite arts in general as appears from the fondness he expresses for them in several parts of his works particularly Painting Sculpture and Architecture of the two former he made several cu  ious collections and his house built under his direction in St James's Park speaks him not unacquainted with the latter It would be superfluous to enumerate all the writers who have given testimony in his grace's favour as an author Dryden in several of his Dedications while he expresses the warmth of his gratitude fails not to convey the most amiable idea of his lordship and represents him as a noble writer He lived in friendship with that great poet who has raised indelible monuments to his memory  I shall add but one other testimony of his merit which if some should think unnecessary yet it is pleasing the lines are delightfully sweet and flowing In his Miscellanies thus speaks Mr Pope  ' Muse 'tis enough at length thy labour ends  ' And thou shalt live for Buckingham commends  ' Let crowds of critics now my verse assail  ' Let Dennis write and nameless numbers rail  ' This more than pays whole years of thankless pain  ' Time health and fortune are not lost in vain  ' Sheffield approves consenting Phoebus bends  ' And I and malice from this hour are friends'  The two plays of Julius Caesar which he altered from Shakespear are both with Chorusses after the manner of the Ancients These plays were to have been performed in the year and all the Chorusses were set to music by that great master in composition Signor Bononcini but English voices being few the Italians were applied to who demanded more for their nightly performance than the receipts of the house could amount to at the usual raised prices and on that account the design was dropt  It appears that our noble author had conceived a great regard for Mr Pope on his earliest appearance in the literary world and was among the first to acknowledge the young bard's merit in commendatory verses upon his excellence in poetry The following compliment from the duke is prefixed to the first volume of Mr Pope's works  On Mr POPE and his POEMS by his Grace JOHN SHEFFIELD Duke of BUCKINGHAM  With age decay'd with courts and bus'ness tir'd  Caring for nothing but what ease requir'd  Too dully serious for the muses sport  And from the critics safe arriv'd in port  I little thought of launching forth agen  Amidst advent'rous rovers of the pen  And after so much undeserv'd success  Thus hazarding at last to make it less  Encomiums suit not this censorious time  Itself a subject for satyric rhime  Ignorance honour'd wit and mirth defam'd  Folly triumphant and ev'n Homer blam'd  But to this genius join'd with so much art  Such various learning mix'd in ev'ry part  Poets are bound a loud applause to pay  Apollo bids it and they must obey  And yet so wonderful sublime a thing  As the great ILIAD scarce cou'd make me sing  Except I justly cou'd at once commend  A good companion and as firm a friend  One moral or a mere wellnatur'd deed  Can all desert in sciences exceed  'Tis great delight to laugh at some men's ways  But a much greater to give merit praise  CHARLES COTTON  Esq  THIS ingenious gentleman lived in the reigns of Charles and James II He resided for a great part of his life at Beresford in the county of Stafford He had some reputation for lyric poetry but was particularly famous for burlesque verse He translated from the French Monsieur Corneille's Horace printed in to London and dedicated to his dear sister Mrs Stanhope Hutchinson This play was first finished in but in his prefatory epistle he tells us  'that neither at that time nor for several years after was it intended for the public view it being written for the private divertisement of a fair young lady and ever since it had the honour first to kiss her hands was so entirely hers that the author did not reserve so much as the Brouillon to himself however she being prevailed upon though with some difficulty it was printed in vo '  As to the merit of this play in the original it is sufficient to observe that the critics have allowed it to be the best tragedy of Corneille and the author himself is of the same opinion provided the three last acts had been equal to the two first As to the translation by Mr Cotton we have very considerable authority to pronounce it better than that of Mrs Katherine Philips who could not number versification among her qualities The plot of this play so far as history is concerned may be  read in Livy Florus Dionysius Halicarnasseus c Our stage has lately had a play founded upon this story added to the many it has received called the Roman Father by Mr W Whitehead  Besides this translation Mr Cotton is author of many other works such as his poem called the Wonders of the Peak printed in vo London  M Cotton's works are printed together in one volumo mo The thirteenth edition is dated  His burlesque Poem called Scarronides or Virgil Travestie a mock Poem on the first and fourth Books of Virgil's Aeneid printed in vo London Though the title seems to imply as if his poem was in imitation of Scarron who has translated eight books of Virgil in the same manner yet they who will compare both these pieces will possibly find that he has not only exceeded the French but all those who have made any attempts on that kind of poetry the incomparable author of Hudibras excepted Mr Cotton likewise translated several of Lucian's Dialogues into burlesque verse printed in vo London under the title of the Scoffer Scoff'd In a volume of poems with Mr Cotton's name prefixed was published in London on these poems colonel Lovelace Sir Aston Cockaine Robert Harrick  Esq  and Mr Alexander Brome complimented the author by copies of verses prefixed but Mr Langbain observes that the truest picture of Mr Cotton's mind is to be seen in a little piece published at the end of these poems called Retirement but the chief of Mr Cotton's production seems to be his translation of Montaigne's Essays dedicated to George Lord Saville Marquis of Hallifax his lordship in a letter to him thus expresses his esteem for the translator and admiration of his performance This letter is printed amongst the other pieces of the marquis's in a thin mo  'SIR  'I have too long delayed my thanks to you for giving me such an obliging evidence of your remembrance that alone would have been a welcome present but when joined with the book in the world I am the best entertained with it raiseth a strong desire in me to be better known where I am sure to be much pleased I have 'till now thought wit could not be translated and do still retain so much of that opinion that I believe it impossible except by one whose genius cometh up to the author You have so kept the original strength of his thought that it almost tempts a man to believe the transmigration of souls He hath by your means mended his first edition To transplant and make him ours is not only a valuable acquisition to us but a just censure of the critical impertinence of those French scriblers who have taken pains to make little cavils and exceptions to lessen the reputation of this great man whom nature hath made too big to confine himself to the exactness of a studied stile He let his mind have its full flight and shewed by a generous kind of negligence that he did not write for praise but to give to the world a true picture of himself and of mankind He scorned affected periods to please the mistaken reader with an empty chime of words he hath no affectation to set himself out and dependeth wholly upon the natural force of what is his own and the excellent application of what he borroweth'  'You see sir I have kindness enough for Monsieur de Montaigne to be your rival but nobody can pretend to be in equal competition with you I do willingly yield which is no small matter for a man to do to a more prosperous lover and  if you will repay this piece of justice with another pray believe that he who can translate such an author without doing him wrong must not only make me glad but proud of being his'  'most humble servant * * *'  Thus far the testimony of the marquis of Hallifax in favour of our author's performance and we have good reason to conclude that the translation is not without great merit when so accomplished a judge has praised it  We cannot be certain in what year our author died but it was probably some time about the revolution He appears to have been a man of very considerable genius to have had an extraordinary natural vein of humour and an uncommon flow of pleasantry he was certainly born a poet and wrote his verses easily but rather too loosely his numbers being frequently harsh and his stile negligent and unpolished The cause of his Life being inserted out of chronological order was an accident the particulars of which are not of importance enough to be mentioned  The Right Honourable JOSEPH ADDISON  Esq  THIS elegant writer to whom the world owes so many obligations was born at Milton near Ambrosbury in the county of Wilts of which place his father Mr Lancelot Addison was then rector on the th of May and being not thought likely to live was baptized on the same day as appears from the church register When he grew up to an age fit for going to school he was put under the care of the rev Mr Naish at Ambrosbury He afterwards removed to a school at Salisbury taught by the rev Mr Taylor thence to the Charterhouse where he was under the tuition of the learned Dr Ellis and where he contracted an intimacy with Mr Steel afterwards Sir Richard which continued as long as Mr Addison lived He was not above fifteen years old when he was entered of Queen's College Oxford in which his father had been placed where he applied himself so closely to the study of classical learning that in a very short time he became master of a very elegant Latin stile even before he arrived at that age when ordinary scholars begin to write good English  In the year a copy of his verses in that tongue fell into the hands of Dr Lancaster dean of Magdalen College who was so pleased with them that he immediately procured their author's election into that house  Tickell's Preface to Addison's works  where he took the degrees  of bachelor and master of arts In the course of a few years his Latin poetry was justly admired at both the universities and procured him great reputation there before his name was so much as known in London When he was in the d year of his age he published a copy of verses addressed to Mr Dryden which soon procured him the notice of some of the poetical judges in that age The verses are not without their elegance but if they are much removed above common rhimes they fall infinitely short of the character Mr Addison's friends bestowed upon them Some little space intervening he sent into the world a translation of the th Georgic of Virgil of which we need not say any more than that it was commended by Mr Dryden He wrote also that discourse on the Georgics prefixed to them by way of preface in Mr Dryden's translation and chose to withhold his name from that judicious composition because it contained an untried strain of criticism which bore hard upon the old professors of that art and therefore was not so fit for a young man to take upon himself and Mr Dryden who was above the meanness of fathering any one's work owns the Essay on the Georgics to have come from a friend whose name is not mentioned because he desired to have it concealed  The next year Mr Addison wrote several poems of different kinds amongst the rest one addressed to Henry Sacheverel who became afterwards so exceedingly famous The following year he wrote a poem to King William on one of his Campaigns addressed to the Lord Keeper Sir John Somers That excellent statesman received this mark of a young author's attachment with great humanity admitted Mr Addison into the number of his friends and gave him on all occasions distinguishing proofs of a sincere esteem  Tickell Ubi supra    While he was at the university he had been pressingly sollicited to enter into holy orders which he seemed once resolved on probably in obedience to his father's authority but being conscious of the importance of the undertaking and deterred by his extreme modesty he relinquished says Mr Tickell all views that way but Sir Richard Steel in his letter to Mr Congreve prefixed to the Drummer who had a quarrel with Tickell on account of an injurious treatment of him says that those were not the reasons which made Mr Addison turn his thoughts to the civil world  'and as you were the inducement says he of his becoming acquainted with my lord Hallifax I doubt not but you remember the warm instances that noble lord made to the head of the college not to insist on Mr Addison's going into orders his arguments were sounded on the general pravity and corruption of men of business who wanted liberal education and I remember as if I had read the letter yesterday that my lord ended with a compliment that however he might be represented as no friend to the church he would never do it any other injury than by keeping Mr Addison out of it'  Mr Addison having discovered an inclination to travel the abovementioned patron out of zeal as well to his country as our author procured him from the crown an annual pension of l which enabled him to make a tour to Italy the latter end of His Latin poems dedicated to Mr Montague then Chancellor of the Exchequer were printed before his departure in the Musae Anglicanae and were as much esteemed in foreign countries as at home particularly by that noble wit of France Boileau It is from Mr Tickell we learn this circumstance in relation to Boileau and we shall present it to the reader in his own words  'his country owes it to Mr Addison that  the famous Monsieur Boileau first conceived an opinion of the English genius for poetry by perusing the present he made him of the Musae Anglicanae It has been currently reported that this famous French poet among the civilities he shewed Mr Addison on that occasion affirmed that he would not have written against Perrault had he before seen such excellent pieces by a modern hand The compliment he meant wa  that these books had given him a very new idea of the English politeness and that he did not question but there were excellent comp sitions in the native language of a country which possessed the Roman genius in so eminent a degree'  In Mr Addison wrote an epistolary poem from Italy to lord Hallifax which is much admired as a finished piece in its kind and indeed some have pronounced it the best of Mr Addison's performances It was translated by the Abbot Antonio Mario Salvini Greek Professor at Florence into Italian verse which translation is printed with the original in Mr Tickell's to edition of Mr Addison's works This poem is in the highest esteem in Italy because there are in it the best turned compliments on that country that perhaps are to be found any where and the Italians on account of their familiarity with the objects it describes must have a higher relish of it This poem likewise shews his gratitude to lord Hallifax who had been that year impeached by the Commons in Parliament for procuring exorbitant grants from the crown to his own use and further charged with cutting down and wasting the timber in his Majesty's forests and with holding several offices in his Majesty's Exchequer that were inconsistent and designed as checks upon each other The Commons had likewise addressed the King to remove him from his councils and presence for ever These were the causes of his retiring and Mr Addison's  address at this time was a noble instance of his fidelity and stedfastness to his friends  On his return to England he published an account of his travels dedicated to lord Somers he would have returned earlier than he did had not he been thought of as a proper person to attend prince Eugene who then commanded for the emperor in Italy which employment would much have pleased him but the death of king William intervening caused a cessation of his pension and his hopes  For a considerable space of time he remained at home and as his friends were out of the ministry he had no opportunity to display his abilities or to meet a competent reward for the honour his works had already done his country He owed both to an accident In the year lord treasurer Godolphin happened to complain to the lord Hallifax that the duke of Marlborough's victory at Blenheim had not been celebrated in verse in the manner it deserved and told him that he would take it kind if his lordship who was the patron of the poets would name a gentleman capable of writing upon so elevated a subject Lord Hallifax replied with some quickness that he was well acquainted with such a person but that he would not name him and observed that he had long seen with indignation men of little or no merit maintained in pomp and luxury at the expence of the public while persons of too much modesty with great abilities languished in obscurity The treasurer answered very cooly that he was sorry his lordship had occasion to make such an observation but that in the mean time he would engage his honour that whoever his lordship should name might venture upon this theme without fear of losing his time Lord Hallifax thereupon named Mr Addison but insisted the treasurer should send to him himself which he promised Accordingly he prevailed upon Mr Boyle then chancellor of the  exchequer to go in his name to Mr Addison and communicate to him the business which he did in so obliging a manner that he readily entered upon the task  Budgel's Memoirs of the Boyles  The lord treasurer saw the Poem before it was finished when the author had written no farther than the celebrated simile of the Angel and was so much pleased with it that he immediately made him commissioner of appeals in the room of Mr Locke who was promoted to be one of the lords commissioners for trade c  His Poem entitled the Campaign was received with loud and general applause It is addressed to the duke of Marlborough and contains a short view of the military transactions in the year and a very particular description of the two great actions at Schellemberg and Blenheim  In Mr Addison attended the lord Hallifax to Hanover and in the succeeding year he was made choice of for undersecretary to Sir Charles Hedges then appointed secretary of state In the month of December in the same year the earl of Sunderland who succeeded Sir Charles in that office continued Mr Addison in the post of under secretary  Operas being now much in fashion many people of distinction and true taste importuned him to make a trial whether sense and sound were really so incompatible as some admirers of the Italian pieces would represent them He was at last prevailed upon to comply with their request and composed his Rosamond This piece was inscribed to the duchess of Marlborough and met with but indifferent success on the stage Many looked upon it as not properly an Opera for considering what numbers of miserable productions had born that title they were scarce satisfied that so superior a piece should appear under the same denomination About  this time our author assisted Sir Richard Steel in a play called the Tender Husband to which he wrote a humorous Prologue Sir Richard whose gratitude was as warm and ready as his wit surprized him with a dedication which may be considered as one of the few monuments of praise not unworthy the great person to whose honour it was raised  In he went over to Ireland as secretary to the marquis of Wharton appointed lord lieutenant of that kingdom Her majesty also was pleased as a mark of her peculiar favour to augment the salary annexed to the keeper of the records in that nation and bestow it upon him While he was in Ireland his friend Sir Richard Steel published the Tatler which appeared for the first time on the th of April Mr Addison says Tickell discovered the author by an observation on Virgil he had communicated to him This discovery led him to afford farther assistance insomuch that as the author of the Tatler well exprest it he fared by this means like a distrest prince who calls in a powerful neighbour to his aid that is he was undone by his auxiliary  The superiority of Mr Addison's papers in that work is universally admitted and being more at leisure upon the change of the ministry he continued assisting in the Tatler till when it was dropt  No sooner was the Tatler laid down but Sir Richard Steel in concert with Mr Addison formed the plan of the Spectator The first paper appeared on the first of March and in the course of that great work Mr Addison furnished all the papers marked with any Letters of the Muse CLIO and which were generally most admired Tickell who had no kindness for Sir Richard Steel meanly supposes that he marked his paper out of precaution against Sir Richard which was an illnatur'd insinuation for in the conclusion of the Spectators he acknowledges to Mr Addison all he had a right  to and in his letter to Congreve he declares that Addison's papers were marked by him out of tenderness to his friend and a warm zeal for his fame Steel was a generous grateful friend it therefore ill became Mr Tickell in the defence of Mr Addison's honour which needed no such stra tagem to depreciate one of his dearest friends and at the expence of truth and his reputation raise the character of his Hero Sir Richard had opposed Mr Addison in the choice of Mr Tickell as his secretary which it seems he could never forget nor forgive  In the Spectators Sir Roger de Coverly was Mr Addison's favourite character and so tender was he of it that he went to Sir Richard upon his publishing a Spectator in which he made Sir Roger pick up a woman in the temple cloisters and would not part with his friend until he promised to meddle with the old knight's character no more However Mr Addison to make sure and to prevent any absurdities the writers of the subsequent Spectators might fall into resolved to remove that character out of the way or as he pleasantly expressed it to an intimate friend killed Sir Roger that no body else might murther him When the old Spectator was finished a new one appeared but though written by men of wit and genius it did not succeed and they were wise enough not to push the attempt too far Posterity must have a high idea of the taste and good sense of the British nation when they are informed that twentythousand of these papers were sometimes sold in a day  Tickell's Preface    The Guardian a paper of the same tendency entertained the town in the years and in which Mr Addison had likewise a very large share he also wrote two papers in the Lover  In the year appeared his famous Cato He entered into a design of writing a Tragedy on that subject when he was very young and when he was on his travels he actually wrote four acts of it However he ret  uched it on his return without any design of bringing it on the stage but some friends of his imagining it might be of service to the cause of liberty he was prevailed upon to finish it for the theatre which he accordingly did When this play appeared it was received with boundless admiration and during the representation on the first night on which its fate depended it is said that Mr Addison discovered uncommon timidity he was agitated between hope and fear and while he remained retired in the greenroom he kept a person continually going backwards and forwards from the stage to the place where he was to inform him how it succeeded and till the whole was over and the success confirmed he never ventured to move  When it was published it was recommended by many Copies of Verses prefixed to it amongst which the sincerity of Mr Steele and the genius of Eusden deserve to be distinguished But as I would not omit any particulars relative to this renowned play and its great author I shall insert a letter of Mr Pope's to Sir William Turnbull dated the th of April in which are some circumstances that merit commemoration  SIR  'As to poetical affairs I am content at present to be a bare looker on and from a practitioner turn an admirer which as the world goes is not very usual Cato was not so much the wonder of  Rome in his Days as he is of Britain in ours and though all the foolish industry possible had been used to make it thought a party play yet what the author once said of another may the most properly in the world be applied to him on this occasion  Envy itself is dumb in wonder lost  And factions strive who shall applaud him most  'The numerous and violent claps of the Whig party on the one side of the theatre were ecchoed back by the Tories on the other while the author sweated behind the scenes with concern to find their applause proceeding more from the hard than the head This was the case too with the Prologue writer who was clapp'd into a staunch Whig at the end of every two lines I believe you have heard that after all the applauses of the opposite faction my lord Bolingbroke sent for Booth who played Cato into the box between one of the acts and presented him with fifty guineas in acknowledgment as he expressed it for defending the cause of liberty so well against a perpetual dictator The Whigs are unwilling to be distanced this way and therefore design a present to the same Cato very speedily in the mean time they are getting ready as good a sentence as the former on their side so betwixt them it is probable that Cato as Dr Garth exprest it may have something to live upon after he dies'  Immediately after the publication of this Tragedy there came abroad a pamphlet entitled Observations on Cato written by the ingenious Dr Sewel The design of this piece was to shew that the applause this Tragedy met with was founded on merit It is a very accurate and  entertaining criticism and tends to secure the poet the hearts of his readers as well as of his audience Our author was not however without enemies amongst whom was Mr Dennis who attacked it first in a pamphlet and then in a subsequent work in which he employed seven letters in pulling it to pieces In some of his remarks he is candid and judicious enough in others he is trifling and ill natur'd and I think it is pretty plain he was agitated by e  vy for as the intent of that play was to promote the Whig interest of which Mr Dennis was a zealous abettor he could not therefore disesleem it from party principles Another gentleman who called himself a scholar at Oxford considered the play in a very different light and endeavoured to serve his party by turning the cannon upon the enemy The title of this pamphlet is Mr Addison turned Tory It is written with great spirit and vivacity Cato was speedily translated into French by Mr Boyer but with no spirit It was translated likewise into Italian  Voltaire has commended and condemned Mr Addison by turns and in respect to Cato he admires and censures it extravagantly The principal character he allows superior to any before brought upon the stage but says that all the loves  enes are absolutely insipid He might have added unnecessary as to the plot and the only reason that can be assigned for the poet's introducing them was the prevalence of custom but it must be acknowledged that his lovers are the most sensible and address each other in the best language that is to be found in any love dialogues of the British stage It will be difficult to find a more striking line or more picturesque of a lover's passion than this pathetic exclamation  A lover does not live by vulgar time  Queen Anne was not the last in doing justice to our author and his performance she was pleased to signify an inclination of having it dedicated to her but as he intended that compliment to another it came into the world without any dedication If in the subsequent part of his life his leisure had been greater we are told he would probably have written another tragedy on the death of Socrates but the honours accruing from what he had already performed deprived posterity of that production This subject was still drier and less susceptible of poetical ornament than the former but in the hands of so great a writer there is no doubt but genius would have supplied what was wanting in the real story and have covered by shining sentiments and noble language the simplicity of the plot and deficiency in business  Upon the death of the Queen the Lords Justices appointed Mr Addison their secretary This diverted him from the design he had formed of composing an English Dictionary upon the plan of a famous Italian one that the world has much suffered by this promotion I am ready to believe and cannot but regret that our language yet wants the assistance of so great a master in fixing its standard settling its purity and illustrating its copiousness or elegance  In our author married the countess of Warwick and about that time published the Freeholder which is a kind of political Spectator This work Mr Addison conducted without any assistance upon a plan of his own forming he  did it in consequence of his principles out of a desire to remove prejudices and contribute all he could to make his country happy however it produced his own promotion in to be one of the principal secretaries of state His health which had been before impaired by an asthmatic disorder suffered exceedingly by an advancement so much to his honour but attended with such great fatigue Finding that he was not able to manage so much business as his station led him to he resigned and in his leisure hours began a work of a religious nature upon the Evidence of the Christian religion which he lived not to finish He likewise intended a Paraphrase on some of the Psalms of David but a long and painful relapse broke all his designs and deprived the world of one of its brightest ornaments June when he was entering the th year of his age He died at Hollandhouse near Kensington and left behind him an only daughter by the countess of Warwick  After his decease Mr Tickell by the authority and direction of the author collected and published his works in four volumes to In this edition there are several pieces as yet unmentioned which I shall here give account of in order the first is a Dissertation upon Medals which though not published 'till after his death was begun in when he was at Vienna  In there came abroad a pamphlet under the title of The Present State of the War and the Necessity of an Augmentation Considered The Whig Examiner came out September for the first time there were five papers in all attributed to Mr Addison these are by much the tartest things he ever wrote Dr Sacheverel  Mr Prior and many other persons are severely treated The Exam ner had done the same thing on the part of the Tories and the avowed design of this paper was to make reprisals  In the year was published a little pamphlet called The Late Trial and Conviction of Count Tariff it was intended to expose the Tory ministry on the head of the French Commerce Bill This is also a severe piece  The following have likewise been ascribed to cur author  Dissertatio de insignioribus Romanorum Poctis i e A Dissertation upon the most Eminent Roman Poets This is supposed to have been written about  A Discourse on Ancient and Modern Learning the time when it was written is uncertain but probably as early as the former It was preserved amongst the manuscripts of lord Somers which after the death of Sir Joseph Jekyl being publickly sold this little piece came to be printed and was well received To these we must add the Old Whig No and Pamphlets written in Defence of the Peerage Eill The scope of the Bill was this that in place of Peers sitting in Parliament as Representatives of the Peerage of Scotland there were for the future to be twenty five hereditary Peers by the junction of nine out of the body of the Scotch nobility to the then sitting Peers that six English Peers should be added and the peerage then remain fixed the crown being restrained from making any new lords but upon the extinction of families This gave a great  alarm to the nation and many papers were wrote with spirit against it amongst the rest one called the Plebeian now known to have been Sir Richard Steele's In answer to this came out the Old Whig No on the State of the Peerage with some Remarks on the Plebeian This controversy was c  rried on between the two friends Addison and Steele at first without any knowledge of one another but before it was ended it appears from several expressions that the author of the Old Whig was acquainted with his antagonist  Thus we have gone through the most remarkable passages of the life of this great man in admiration of whom it is but natural to be an Enthusiast and whose very enemies expressed their dislike with diffidence nor indeed were his enemies Mr Pope excepted if it be proper to reckon Mr Pope Mr Addison's enemy in one particular case of any consequence It is a true and an old observation that the greatest men have sometimes failings that of all other human weaknesses one would not suspect them to be subject to It is said of Mr Addison that he was a slave to flattery that he was jealous and suspicious in his temper and as Pope keenly expresses it  Bore like the Turk no rival near the throne  That he was jealous of the fame of Pope many have believed and perhaps not altogether without ground He preferred Tickel's translation of the first Book of Homer to Pope's His words are  'the other has more of Homer'  when at the same time in a letter to Pope he strenuously advises him to undertake it and tells him there is none but he equal to it which circumstance has made some  people conjecture that Addison was himself the author of the translation imputed to Mr Tickell Be this as it may it is unpleasing to dwell upon the failings and quarrels of great men let us rather draw a veil over all their errors and only admire their virtues and their genius of both which the author the incidents of whose life we have now been tracing had a large possession He added much to the purity of the English stile in prose his rhime is not so flowing nervous or manly as some of his cotemporaries but his prose has an original excellence a smoothness and dignity peculiar to it His poetry as well as sentiments in Cato cannot be praised enough  Mr Addison was stedfast to his principles faithful to his friends a zealous patriot honourable in public stations amiable in private life and as he lived he died a good man and a pious Christian  ANNE Countess of WINCHELSEA  THIS lady deservedly celebrated for her poetic genius was daughter of Sir William Kingsmill of Sidmonton in the county of Southampton She was Maid of Honour to the Duchess of York second wife to King James II and was afterwards married to Heneage earl of Winchelsea who was in his father's lifetime Gentleman of the Bedchamber to the Duke of York  One of the most considerable of this lady's poems is that upon the Spleen published by Mr Charles Gildon in vo That poem occasioned another of Mr Nicholas Rowe's entitled an Epistle to Flavia on the sight of two Pindaric Odes on the Spleen and Vanity written by a Lady to her Friend This poem of the Spleen is written in stanzas after the manner of Cowley and contains many thoughts naturally expressed and poetically conceived there is seldom to be found any thing more excellently picturesque than this poem and it justly entitles the amiable countess to hold a very high station amongst the inspired tribe Nothing can be more happily imagined than the following description of the pretended influence of Spleen upon surly Husbands and gay Coquetes  Patron thou art of every gross abuse  The sullen husband's feign'd excuse  When the ill humours with his wife he spends  And bears recruited wit and spirits to his friends  The son of Bacchus pleads thy pow'r  As to the glass he still repairs  Pretends but to remove thy cares  Snatch from thy shades one gay and smiling hour  And drown thy kingdom in a purple show'r  When the coquette whom ev'ry fool admires  Would in variety be fair  And changing hastily the scene  From light impertinent and vain  Assumes a soft a melancholy air  And of her eyes rebates the wand'ring fires  The careless posture and the head reclin'd  Proclaiming the withdrawn the absent mind  Allows the fop more liberty to gaze  Who gently for the tender cause enquires  The cause indeed is a defect of sense  Yet is the Spleen alledged and still the dull pretence  The influence which Spleen has over religious minds is admirably painted in the next stanza  By spleen religion all we know  That should enlighten here below  Is veiled in darkness and perplext  With anxious doubts with endless scruples vext  And some restraint imply'd from each perverted text  Whilst touch not taste not what is freely given  Is but thy niggard voice disgracing bounteous Heaven  From speech restrain'd by the deceits abus'd  To desarts banish'd or in cells reclus'd  Mistaken vot'ries to the powers divine  Whilst they a purer sacrifice design  Do but the spleen obey and worship at thy shrine  A collection of this lady's poems was published at London in vo containing likewise a Tragedy never acted entitled Aristomenes or the Royal Shepherd The general scenes are in Aristomenes's camp near the walls of Phaerea sometimes the plains among the Shepherds A great number of our authoress's poems still continue unpublished in the hands of the rev Mr Creake and some were in possession of the right hon the countess of Hertford  The countess of Winchelsea died August without issue She was happy in the friendship of Mr Pope who addresses a copy of verses to her occasioned by eight lines in the Rape of the Lock they contain a very elegant compliment  In vain you boast poetic names of yore  And cite those Saphoes we admire no more  Fate doom'd the fall of ev'ry female wit  But doom'd it then when first Ardelia writ  Of all examples by the world confest  I knew Ardelia could not quote the best  Who like her mistress on Britannia's throne  Fights and subdues in quarrels not her own  To write their praise you but in vain essay  E'en while you write you take that praise away  Light to the stars the sun does thus restore  And shines himself 'till they are seen no more  The answer which the countess makes to the above is rather more exquisite than the lines of Mr Pope he is foil'd at his own weapons and outdone in the elegance of compliment  Disarm'd with so genteel an air  The contest I give o'er  Yet Alexander have a care  And shock the sex no more  We rule the world our life's whole race  Men but assume that right  First slaves to ev'ry tempting face  Then martyrs to our spite  You of one Orpheus sure have read  Who would like you have writ  Had he in London town been bred  And polish'd too his wit  But he poor soul thought all was well  And great should be his fame  When he had left his wife in hell  And birds and beasts could tame  Yet venturing then with scoffing rhimes  The women to incense  Resenting heroines of those times  Soon punished his offence  And as the Hebrus roll'd his skull  And Harp besmeared with blood  They clashing as the waves grew full  Still harmoniz'd the flood  But you our follies gently treat  And spin so fine the thread  You need not fear his awkward fate  The lock won't cost the head  Our admiration you command  For all that's gone before  What next we look for at your hand  Can only raise it more  Yet sooth the ladies I advise  As me too pride has wrought  We're born to wit but to be wife  By admonitions taught  The other pieces of this lady are  An Epilogue to Jane Shore to be spoken by Mrs Oldfield the night before the Poet's day  To the Countess of Hertford with her Volume of Poems  The Prodigy a Poem written at TunbridgeWells on the Admiration that many expressed on a Gentleman's being in love and their Endeavours to dissuade him from it with some Advice to the young Ladies how to maintain their natural Prerogative  If all her other poetical compositions are executed with as much spirit and elegance as these the lovers of poetry have some reason to be sorry that her station was such as to exempt her from the necessity of more frequently exercising a genius so furnished by nature to have made a great figure in that divine art  CHARLES GILDON  THIS gentleman was born at Gillingham near Shaftshury in the county of Dorset His parents and family were all of the Romish persuasion but they could not instil their principles into our author who as soon as he began to reason was able to discover the errors and foppery of that church His father was a member of the society of GraysInn and suffered much for the Royal cause The first rudiments of learning Mr Gi  don had at the place of his nativity thence his relations sent him to the English college of secular priests at Doway in Hainault with a design of making him a priest but after five years study there he found his inclination direct him to a quite different course of life When he was nineteen years old he returned to England and as soon as he was of age and capable of enjoying the pleasures of gaiety he came to Londos where he spent the greatest part of his paternal estate At about the age of twentythree to crown his other imprudences he married without improving his reduced circumstances thereby  During the reign of King James II he dedicated his time to the st  dy of the prevailing controversies and he s  mewhere declares it cost him above seven years close application to books before he could entirely overcome the prejudices of his education He never believed the absurd  tenets of the church of Rome nor could he embrace the ridiculous doctrine of her infallibility But as he had been taught an early reverence to the priesthood and a submissive obedience to their authority it was a long while before he assumed courage to think freely for himself or declare what he thought  His first attempt in the drama was not till he had arrived at his d year and he himself in his essays tells us that necessity the general inducement was his first motive of venturing to be an author  He is the author of three plays viz  The Roman Bride's Revenge a Tragedy acted at the TheatreRoyal This play was written in a month and had the usual success of hasty productions though the first and second acts are well written and the catastrophe beautiful the moral being to give us an example in the punishment of Martian that no consideration ought to make us delay the service of our country  Phaeton or the Fatal Divorce a Tragedy acted at the TheatreRoyal dedicated to Charles Montague  Esq  This play is written in imitation of the ancients with some reflexions on a book called a Short View of the Immorality of the English Stage written by Mr Collier a Nonjuring Clergyman who combated in the cause of virtue with success against Dryden Congreve Dennis and our author The plot of this play and a great many of the beauties Mr Gildon owns in his preface he has taken from the Medea of Euripides  Love's Victim or the Queen of Wales a Tragedy acted at the Theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields  He introduced the Play called the Younger Brother or the Amorous Jilt written by Mrs Behn but not brought upon the stage 'till after her decease He made very little alteration in it Our author's plays have not his name to them and his fault lies generally in the stile which is too near an imitation of Lee's  He wrote a piece called the New Rehearsal or Bays the Younger containing an Examen of the Ambitious Stepmother Tamerlane The Biter Fair Penitent The Royal Convert Ulysses and Jane Shore all written by Mr Rowe also a Word or Two on Mr Pope's Rape of the Lock to which is prefixed a Preface concerning Criticism in general by the Earl of Shaftsbury Author of the Characteristics vo Scene the Rose Tavern The freedom he used with Mr Pope in remarking upon the Rape of the Lock it seems was sufficient to raise that gentleman's resentment who was never celebrated for forgiving Many years after Mr Pope took his revenge by stigmatizing him as a dunce in his usual keen spirit of satire There had arisen some quarrel between Gildon and Dennis upon which Mr Pope in his Dunciad B iii has the following lines  Ah Dennis Gildon ah what illstarr'd rage  Divides a friendship long confirm'd by age  Blockheads with reason wicked wits abhor  But fool with fool is barb'rous civil war  Embrace embrace my sons be foes no more  Nor glad vile poets with true critics gore  This author's other works are chiefly these  The PostBoy Robb'd of his Mail o  the Packet

Reason Second Thoughts c to which is prefixed a Letter from the Author of the Method with the Deists  Complete Art of Poetry  Mr Gildon died on the th of January and in the words of Boyer's Political State vol xxvii p we shall sum up his character  'On Sunday January died Mr Charles Gildon a person of great literature but a mean genius who having attempted several kinds of writing never gained much reputation in any Among other treatises he wrote the English Art of Poetry which he had practised himself very unsuccessfully in his dramatic performances He also wrote an English Grammar but what he seemed to build his chief hopes of fame upon was his late Critical Commentary on the Duke of Buckingham's Essay on Poetry which last piece was perused and highly approved by his grace'  THOMAS D'URFEY  WAS born in the county of Devon and was first bred to the law but we have not heard from what samily he was descended nor in what year he was born He has written upwards of thirty plays with various success but had a genius better turned to a ballad and little irregular odes than for dramatic poetry He soon forsook the prosession of the law and threw himself upon the public by writing for the stageThat D'Urfey was a man of some abilities and enjoyed the esteem and friendship of men of the greatest parts in his time appears from the favourable testimony of the author of the Guardian And as the design of this work is to collect and throw into one view whatever may be found concerning any poet of eminence in various books and literary records we shall make no scruple of transcribing what that ingenious writer has humorously said concerning our author  In Numb Vol speaking of the advantages of laughing he thus mentions D'Urfey  'A judicious author some years since published a collection of Sonnets which he very successfully called Laugh and be Fat or Pills to purge Melancholy I cannot sufficiently admire the facetious title of these volumes and must censure the world of ingratitude while they are so negligent  in rewarding the jocose labours of my friend Mr D'Urfey who was so large a contributor to this Treatise and to whose humorous productions so many rural squires in the remotest parts of this island are obliged for the dignity and state which corpulency gives them It is my opinion that the above pills would be extremely proper to be taken with Asses milk and might contribute towards the renewing and restoring decayed lungs'  Numb He thus speaks of his old friend  'It has been remarked by curious observers that poets are generally long lived and run beyond the usual age of man if not cut off by some accident or excess as Anacreon in the midst of a very merry old age was choaked with a grape stone The same redundancy of spirits that produces the poetical flame keeps up the vital warmth and administers uncommon fuel to life I question not but several instances will occur to my reader's memory from Homer down to Mr Dryden I shall only take notice of two who have excelled in Lyrics the one an antient the other a modern The first gained an immortal reputation by celebrating several jockeys in the Olympic Games the last has signalized himself on the same occasion by the Ode that begins withTo horse brave boys to Newmarket to horse The reader will by this time know that the two poets I have mentioned are Pindar and Mr D'Urfey The former of these is long since laid in his urn after having many years together endeared himself to all Greece by his tuneful compositions Our countryman is still living and in a blooming old age that still promises many musical productions for if I am not mistaken our British Swan will sing to the last The best judges who have perused his last Song on the moderate Man do not discover any decay in his parts but  think it deserves a place among the finest of those works with which he obliged the world in his more early years  'I am led into this subject by a visit which I lately received from my good old friend and cotemporary As we both flourished together in king Charles the IId's reign we diverted ourselves with the remembrance of several particulars that pass'd in the world before the greatest part of my readers were born and could not but smile to think how insensibly we were grown into a couple of venerable old gentlemen Tom observed to me that after having written more Odes than Horace and about four times as many Comedies as Terence he was reduced to great difficulties by the importunities of a set of men who of late years had furnished him with the acccommodations of life and would not as we say be paid with a song In order to extricate my old friend I immediately sent for the three directors of the Playhouse and desired they would in their turn do a good office for a man who in Shakespear's phrase often filled their mouths I mean with pleasantry and popular conceits They very generously listened to my proposal and agreed to act the Plotting Sisters a very taking play of my old friends composing on the th of next month for the benefit of the author  'My kindness to the agreeable Mr D'Urfey will be imperfect if after having engaged the players in his favour I do not get the town to come into it I must therefore heartily recommend to all the young ladies my disciples the case of my old friend who has often made their grandmothers merry and whose Sonnets have perhaps lulled asleep many a present toast when she lay in her cradle The gentleman I am speaking of has laid obligations on so many of his countrymen that I  hope they will think this but a just return to the good service of a vet  ran Poet  'I myself remember king Charles the IId leaning on Tom D'Urfey's shoulder more than once and humming over a song with him It is certain that monarch was not a little supported by joy to great Caesar which gave the Whigs such a blow as they were not able to recover that whole reign My friend afterwards attacked Popery with the same saccess having exposed Bel armine and Portocarero more than once in short satirical compositions which have been in every body's mouth He made use of Italian Tunes and Sonato's for promoting the Protestant interest and turned a considerable part of the Pope's music against himself In short he has obliged the court with political S  nnets the country with Dialogues and Pastorals the city with Descriptions of a lo  d Mayor's  east not to mention his little Ode upon StoolBall with many others of the like nature  'Should the very individuals he has celebrated make their appearance together they would be sufficient to fill the playhouse Pretty Peg of Windsor Gilian of Croydon with Dolly and Molly and Tommy and Johny with many others to be met with in the musical Miscellanies would make a great benefit  'As my friend after the manner of the old Lyrics accompanies his works with his own voice he has been the delight of the most polite companies and conversations from the beginning of king Charles the IId's reign to our own times Many an honest gentleman has got a reputation in his country by pretending to have been in company with Tom D'Urfey  'I might here mention several other merits in my friend as his enriching our langauge with a multitade of rhimes and bringing words together that without his good offices would never have been  acquainted with one another so long as it had been a tongue but I must not omit that my old friend angled for a trout the best of any man in England  'After what I have said and much more that I might say on this subject I question not but the world will think that my old friend ought not to pass the remainder of his life in a cage like a singing bird but enjoy all that Pindaric liberty which is suitable to a man of his genius He has made the world merry and I hope they will make him easy as long as he stays amongst us This I will take upon me to say they cannot do a kindness to a more diverting companion or a more chearful honest goodnatur'd man'  The same author Numb puts his readers in mind when D Urfey's benefit came on of some other circumstances favourable to him  'The Plotting Sisters says he is this day to be acted for the benefit of the author my old friend Mr D'Urfey This comedy was honoured with the presence of King Charles II three of the first five nights My friend has in this work shewn himself a master and made not only the characters of the play but also the furniture of the house contribute to the main design He has made excellent use of a table with a carpet and the key of a closet with these two implements which would perhaps have been overlooked by an ordinary writer he contrives the most natural perplexities allowing only the use of these houshold goods in poetry that ever were represented on a stage He also made good advantage of the knowledge of the stage itself for in the nick of being surprized the lovers are let down and escape at a trap door In a word any who have the curiosity to observe what pleased in the last generation and does not go to a comedy with a r  solution to be grave will find this evening ample  food for mirth Johnson who understands what he does as well as any man exposes the impertinence of an old fellow who has lost his s  nses still pursuing pleasures with great mastery The ingenious Mr Pinkethman is a bashful rake and is sheepish without having modesty with great success Mr Bullock succeeds Nokes in the part of Bubble and in my opinion is not much below him for he does excellently that kind of folly we call absurdity which is the very contrary of wit but next to that is of all things properest to excite mirth What is foolish is the object of pity but absurdity often proceeds from an op  nion of sufficiency and consequently is an honest occasion for laughter These characters in this play cannot but make it a very pleasant entertainment and the decorations of singing and dancing will more than repay the goodnature of those who make an honest man a visit of two merry hours to make his following year unpainful'  These are the testimonies of friendship and esteem which this great author has given in favour of D'Urfey and however his genius may be turned for the Singsong or Ballad which is certainly the lowest species of poetry yet that man cannot be termed contemptible who was thus loved and though in jocular terms praised by Mr Addison  There are few or no particulars relating to the life of this poet preserved He was attached to the Tory interest and in the latter part of Queen Anne's reign frequently had the honour of diverting her with witty catches and songs of humour suited to the spirit of the times He died according to Mr Coxeter February in a good old age and was buried in the Churchyard of St James's Westminster  His dramatic works are  The Siege of Memphis or the Ambitious Queen a Tragedy acted at the Theatreroyal printed in quarto Mr Langbain says that this play is full of bombast and fustian and observes  'That there goes more to the making a poet than copying verses or tagging rhimes and recommends to the modern poetasters the following lines from a Prologue to a Play called the Atheist'  ' Rhimsters get wit e're ye pretend to shew it  ' Nor think a game at Crambo makes a poet'  Madam Fickle or the Witty False One acted at the duke of York's Theatre printed in quarto dedicated to the

This play met with great opposition during the performance which was disturbed by the Catcalls This occasioned the author to take his revenge upon the town by dedicating it to a certain Knight under the title of Sir Critic Catcall The chief plot of this play is founded on a Romance written by Don Francisco de las Coveras called Don Fenise translated into English in vo See the History of Don

author tells us that King William's Queen Mary intended to have it represented at Court  'There are many lines says Jacob in this play above the genius which generally appears in the other works of

his age was entered commoner of Trinity College Oxon and put under the tuition of Mr Abraham Champion fellow of that house but he quitted the university without taking any degree and came to London  Wood's Athen Oxon vol ii p  where he addicted himself to the study of poetry in which he lived to make no inconsiderable figure Finding the nation divided between the opinions of Whig and Tory and being sensible that a man of parts could not make any considerable figure unless he attached himself to one of these parties Settle thought proper on his first setting out in life to join the Whigs who were then though the minor yet a powerful party and to support whose interest he employed his talents  About the year when the debates ran high concerning the exclusion of the Duke of York from the succession on account of his religious principles our author wrote a piece called the Character of a Popish Successor and what may be expected from such an one humbly offered to the consideration of both the Houses of Parliament appointed to meet at Oxon on March This essay it seems was thought of consequence enough to merit an answer as at that time the Exclusion Bill employed the general conversation The answer  to it was entitled The Character of a Rebellion and what England may expect from One printed The author of this last piece is very severe on the character of Settle he represents him as an errant knave a despicable coward and a prophane Atheist and seems amazed that any party should make choice of a champion whose morals were so tainted but as this is only the language of party violence no great credit is to be given to it  The author of this pamphlet carries his zeal and ill manners still further and informs the world of the meanness of our author's birth and education  'most of his relations says he are Barbers and of the baseness falseness and mutability of his nature too many evidences may be brought He closed with the Whigs contrary to the principles he formerly professed at a time when they took occasion to push their cause upon the breaking out of Oates's plot and was ready to fall off from and return to them for his own advantage'  To the abovementioned pamphlet written by Settle various other answers were published some by writers of distinction of which Sir Roger L'Est  ange was one and to this performance of Sir Roger's which was entitled The Character of a Papist in Masquerade supported by Authority and Experience Mr Settle made a Reply entited The Character of a Popish Successor Compleat this in the opinion of the critics is the smartest piece ever written upon the subject of the Exclusion Bill and yet Sir Roger his antagonist  'calls it a pompous wordy thing made up of shifts and suppositions without so much as an argument either offered or answered in stress of the question c'  Mr Settle's cause was so much better than that of his antagonist's that if he had not possessed half the powers he really did he must have come off the conqueror for  who does not see the immediate danger the fatal chances to which a Protestant people are exposed who have the misfortune to be governed by a Popish Prince As the King is naturally powerful he can easily dispose of the places of importance and trust so as to have them filled with creatures of his own who will engage in any enterprize or pervert any law to serve the purposes of the reigning Monarch Had not the nation an instance of this during the short reign of the very Popish Prince against whom Settle contended Did not judge Jeffries a name justly devoted to everlasting infamy corrupt the streams of justice and by the most audacious cruelty pervert the forms of law that the blood of innocent persons might be shed to gratify the appetite of a suspicious master Besides there is always a danger that the religion which the King professes will imperceptibly diffuse itself over a nation though no violence is used to promote it The King as he is the fountain of honour so is he the fountain of fashion and as many people who surround a throne are of no religion in consequence of conviction it is but natural to suppose that fashion would influence them to embrace the religion of the Prince and in James II's reign this observation was verified for the people of fashion embraced the Popish religion so very fast in order to please the King that a witty knight who then lived and who was by his education and principles a Papist being asked by a nobleman what news he made answer I hear no news my lord only God's Papists can get no preferment because the King's Papists swarm so thick This was a sententious and witty observation and it will always hold true that the religion of the King will become the religion of people of fashion and the lower stations ape their superiors  Upon the coronation of King James II the two Parts of the Character of a Popish Successor  were with the Exclusion Bill on the d of April burnt by the subwardens and fellows of Merton College Oxon in a public bonfire made in the middle of their great quadrangle During these contentions Mr Settle also published a piece called The Medal Revers'd published this was an answer to a poem of Dryden's called The Medal occasioned by the bill against the earl of Shaftsbury being found ignoramus at the Old Baily upon which the Whig party made bonfires and ordered a medal to be struck in commemoration of that event Shaftsbury who was by his principles a Whig and who could not but foresee the miseries which afterwards happened under a Popish Prince opposed the succession with all his power he was a man of very great endowments and being of a bustling tumultuous disposition was admirably fitted to be the head of a party He was the leading man against the succession of the Duke of York and argued in the House of Lords with great force against him and what was more remarkable sometimes in the Duke's presence It is related that at the Counciltable when his Majesty and his Royal Brother were both present something concerning the succession was canvassed when Shaftsbury not in the least intimidated spoke his opinion with great vehemence against the Duke and was answered with equal heat but with less force by the then lord chamberlain During this debate the Duke took occasion to whisper the King that his Majesty had a villain of a chancellor to which the King merrily replied oddsfish York what a fool you have of a chamberlain by which it appears his Majesty was convinced that Shaftsbury's arguments were the strongest  In consequence of Shaftsbury's violent opposition to the Duke and the court party there was a Bill of Indictment of High Treason read before his  Majesty's Commissioners of Oyer and Terminer in the SessionsHouse at the Old Bailey but the Jury found it Ignoramus upon which all the party rejoiced at the deliverance of their head These disturbances gave Mr Settle an opportunity to display his abilities which he did not neglect to improve by which means he procured so formidable an antagonist as Mr Dryden who was obliged by his place of laureat to speak and write for the court Dryden had formerly joined Mr Settle in order to reduce the growing reputation of Shadwell but their interest being now so opposite they became poetical enemies in which Settle was no doubt overmatched He wrote a poem however called Azaria and Hushai in five sheets to designed as an answer to Mr Dryden's poem called Absalom and Achitophel  Soon after this if we may credit the Oxford Antiquary Settle changed sides and turned Tory with as much violence as he had formerly espoused the interest of the Whigs He published in in eight sheets in folio a Narrative the first part of which is concerning himself as being of the Tory side the second to shew the inconsistency and contradiction of Titus Oates's Narrative of the Plot of the Popish Party against the Life of King Charles II at the time when that Monarch intended to alter his ministry to have consented to the exclusion of his brother and taken measures to support the Protestant interest This Oates was in the reign of James II tried and convicted of perjury upon the evidence chiefly of Papists and had a severe sentence pronounced and inflicted upon him viz Imprisonment for life twice every year to stand on the pillory and twice to be severely whipt but he received a pardon from King William after suffering his whippings and two years imprisonment with amazing fortitude but was never allowed again to be an evidence  While Settle was engaged in the Tory party he is said by Wood to have been author of Animadversions on the Last Speech and Confession of William Lord Russel who fell a sacrifice to the Duke of York and whose story as related by Burnet never fails to move the reader to tears Also Remarks on Algernon Sidney's Paper delivered to the Sheriffs at his Execution London in one sheet published the la  er end of December the same year Algernon Sidney was likewise murdered by the same kind of violence which popish bigotry had lifted up against the lives of some other British worthies  He also wrote a heroic poem on the Coronation of the High and Mighty Monarch James II London and then commenced a Journalist for the Court and published weekly an Essay in behalf of the Administration If Settle was capable of these mean compliances of writing for or against a party as he was hired he must have possessed a very fordid mind and been totally devoid of all principles of honour but as there is no other authority for it than Wood who is enthusiastic in his temper and often writes of things not as they were but as he would wish them to be the reader may give what credit he pleases to the report  Our author's dramatic works are  The Empress of Morocco a Tragedy acted at the Duke of York's Theatre This play was likewise acted at court as appears by the two Prologues prefixed which were both spoken by the Lady Elizabeth Howard the first Prologue was written by the Earl of Mulgrave the other by Lord Rochester when it was performed at court the Lords and Ladies of the Bedchamber played in it Mr Dryden Mr Shadwell and Mr Crowne wrote against it which began a famous controversy  betwixt the wits of the town wherein says Jacob Mr Dryden was roughly handled particularly by the lord Rochester and the duke of Buckingham and Settle got the laugh upon his side  Love and Revenge a Tragedy acted at the Duke of York's Theatre to dedicated to William Duke of Newcastle  Cambyses King of Persia a Tragedy acted at the Duke's Theatre dedicated to Anne Duchess of Monmouth This tragedy is written in heroic verse the plot from Justin lib i c Herodotus c The Scene is in Suza and Cambyses's camp near the walls of Suza  The

wrote the last scene of it  The Ambitious Slave or a Generous Revenge a Tragedy acted at the Theatre Royal to This play met with ill success  The World in the Moon a Dramatic Comic Opera performed at the Theatre in DorsetGarden by his Majesty's Servants  City Rambler or The Playhouse Wedding a Comedy acted at the TheatreRoyal  The Virgin Prophetess or The Fate of Troy an Opera performed  The Ladies Triumph a Comic Opera presented at the Theatre in Lincoln'sInnFields by Subscription  Our poet possessed a pension from the City Magistrates for an annual Panegyric to celebrate the Festival of the Lord Mayor and in consequence wrote various poems which he calls Triumphs for the Inauguration of the Lord Mayors which are preserved in his works and which it would be needless to enumerate Besides his dramatic pieces he published many occasional poems addressed to his patrons and some funeral elegies on the deaths of his friends It is certain Settle did not want learning and in the opinion of some critics in the early part of his life sometimes excelled Dryden but that was certainly owing more to a power he had of keeping his temper unruffled than any effort of genius for between Dryden and Settle there is as great difference as between our modern versifiers and Pope  Whatever was the success of his poetry he was the  best contriver of machinery in England and for many years of the latter part of his life received an annual salary from Mrs Minns and her daughter Mrs Leigh for writing Drolls for Bartholomew and Southwark Fairs with proper decorations which were generally so well cont  ived that they exceeded those of their opponents in the same profession  Our author died in the Charterhouse some months before his decease he offered a play to the managers of the TheatreRoyal in DruryLane but he lived not to introduce it on the stage it was called The Expulsion of the Danes from Britain  End of the Third Volume  Just published  In a neat Pocket Volume
