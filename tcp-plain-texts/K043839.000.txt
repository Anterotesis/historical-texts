the Subject is now accordingly once more presented to the Public with the necessary Advantages of Dresses and Decorations  The Music is composed by Mr DIBDIN who has already had the Honour to be

COUNTRYMAN  Do you be still  AIR  SERJEANT  What a charming thing's a battle  Trumpets sounding drums a beating  Crack crick crack the cannons rattle  Ev'ry heart with joy elating  With what pleasure are we spying  From the front and from the rear  Round us in the smoaky air  Heads and limbs and bullets flying  Then the groans of soldiers dying  Just like sparrows as it were  At each pop  Hundreds drop  While the muskets prittle prattle  Kill'd and wounded  Lie confounded  What a charming thing's a battle  But the pleasant joke of all  Is when to close attack we fall  Like mad bulls each other butting  Shooting stabbing maiming cutting  Horse and foot  All go to't  Kill's the word both men and cattle  Then to plunder  Blood and thunder  What a charming thing's a battle  SCENE V  The

jest  COUNTRYMAN  I have thought twice and second thoughts are best  Shew folks with beastis to our village came  And hung at door a picture of their game  Bears lions tygers there were four or five  And all so like you'd swear they were alive  A gaping at the cloth the mon spied me  For twopence friend you may walk in says he  But gad I was more wise and walked my way  I saw so much for naught I would not pay  To see a battle thus my moind was bent  But you've so well describ'd it I'm content  SERJEANT  Come brother soldiers let us then be gone  Thou art a base paltroon  COUNTRYMAN  That's all as one  AIR  Ay ay master Serjeant I wish you good day  You've no need at present I thank you to stay  My stomach for battle's gone from me I trow  When it comes back again I'll take care you shall know  With cudgel or fist as long as you list  But as for this fighting  Which some take delight in  This slashing and smashing with sword and with gun  On consideration I've no inclination  To be the partaker of any such fun  I'll e'en stay at home in my village  And carry no arms but for tillage  My wounds shall be made  With the scythe or the spade  If ever my blood should be shed  A finger or so  Shou'd one wound or a toe  For such a distaster  There may be a plaister  But no plaister sticks on a head  SCENE VI  The  Countryman  the  Wife  the  Mother  WIFE  Then wilt thou stay

henceforth wedded to my farm  My thoughts shall never rove on harm  I to the field perchance may go  But it shall be to reap or sow  WIFE  Now blessings on thy honest heart  Thy wife shall bear an equal part  Work thee without doors she within  Will keep the house and card and spin  COUNTRYMAN  How foolish they in love with strife  Who quit the peaceful country life  WIFE  Where wholesome labour is the best  And surest guide to balmy rest  A  That lot true happiness secures  And bless'd be prais'd is mine and yours  Content beneath the humble shed  We'll toil to earn our babies bread  With mutual kindness bear love's yoke  And pity greater finer folk  SCENE THE LAST  Here is introduced an Entertainment of Dancing in the Characters of LightHorse Men Recruits and Country Girls after

babes whom the nation  Regards as a pledge from the sire it reveres  Heav'n sheild the sweet plants from each rude visitation  And rear them to fullness of virtue and years  CHORUS  Beat drums beat amain  Let the earpiercing fife  To our measures give life  While each British heart  In the health bears a part  And joins the loyal strain  SERJEANT  Here's success to his majesty's arms ever glorious  And great may they be on the land and the main  As just is their cause may they still prove victorious  And punish the rashness of France and of Spain  CHORUS  Beat drums beat amain  Let the earpiercing fife  To our measures give life  While each British heart  In the health bears a part  And joins the loyal strain  FINIS
