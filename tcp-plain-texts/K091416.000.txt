 THE ROAD TO RUIN A COMEDY  AS ACTED AT THE  LONDON and DUBLIN THEATRES  DUBLIN Printed for J BRA  CrowStreet  PROLOGUE  Spoken by Mr FAWCET  Enter driving a boy across the stage  AWAY 'Sblood Run for the Author We can do nothing till he appears  Tell him in less than five minutes we shall have the house about our ears  To the audience  Oh sirs The prompter has mislaid the prologue and we are all a mort  I suppose our friends above yonder will soon be making pretty sport  For pity's sake suffer us to go on without itGood dear sirs do  'Twas most abominably dullZounds There stands the writer Well It's very true  One of our te tum ti heroes was to have spoken it who measure nonsense out by the yard  And our chief hope was you'd make too much noise for it to be heard  The author had mounted on the stilts of oratory and elocution  Not but he had a smart touch or two about Poland France and thethe revolution  Telling us that Frenchman and Polishman and every man is our brother▪  And that all men ay even poor negro men have a right to be free one as well as another  Freedom at length said he like a torrent is spreading and swelling  To sweep away pride and reach the most miserable dwelling  To ease happiness art science wit and genius to give birth▪  Ay to fertilize a world and renovate old earth  Thus he went on not mentioning a word about the play  For he says prologues are blots which ought to be wiped away  A gothic practice and in spite of precedent not the better for being old  For if we tell any part of the plot it then becomes a tale twice told  And such twice telling can rarely once excite our wonder  Ergo he that says nothing is least likely to blunder  Since therefore prologues are bad things at best pray my good friends  Never mind the want of one but live in hopes the play will make amends  Exit  DRAMATIS PERSONAE  Mr Dornton  Mr MUNDEN  Harry Dornton  Mr HOLMAN  Mr Sulky  Mr WILSON  Mr Silky  Mr QUICK  Goldfinch  Mr LEWIS  Mr Milford  Mr HARLEY  Mr Smith

been a cursed losing voyage Milford  Mil  I am a hundred and fifty▪ in  Har  And I ten thousand out  Mil  I believe I had better avoid▪ your father for the present  Har  I think you had Dad considers you as my tempter the cause of my ruin  Mil  And I being in his debt he conceives he may treat me without ceremony  Har  Nay damn it Jack do him justice it is not the money you had of him but the ill advice he imputes to you that galls him  Mil  I hear he threatens to arrest me  Har  Yes he has threatened to strike my name out of the firm and disinherit me a thousand times  Mil  Oh but he has been very serious in menacing me  Har  And me too  Mil  You'll be at the tenniscourt to morrow  Har  No  Mil  What not to see the grand match  Har  No  Mil  Oh yes you will  Har  No I am determined  Mil  Yes over night you'll waver in the morning  Har  No It is high time Jack to grow prudent  Mil  Ha ha ha my plan is formed I'll soon be out of debt  Har  How will you get the money  Mil  By calculation  Har  Ha ha ha  Mil  I am resolved on it  What can't a man of invention and genius outwit a blackleg  Har  "Yes if he will be as great a scoundrel"  Mil  That's not necessary A keen eye a contriving head a lucky moment and a little algebra will rout the whole host  How many men of rank and honour having lost their fortunes have double recovered them  Har  And very honourably  Mil  who doubts it  Har  Ha ha haNobody Nobody  Mil  But pray Harry what is it you find so attractive in my late father's amorous relict  Har  Ha ha ha What the widow Warren  Mil  She seems to think and even reports you are to marry  Har  Marry Her A coquette of forty who ridiculously apes all the airs of a girl Fantastic selfish and a fool And marry Disgusting idea Thou wert philosophising as we drove on the condition of a posthorse  Mil  Well  Har  I would rather be a posthorse nay the rascal that drives a posthorse than the base thing thou hast imagined  Mil  Then why are you so often there  Har  Because I can't keep away  Mil  What it is her daughter Sophia  Har  Lovely bewitching innocent  Mil  The poor young thing is fond of you  Har  I should be half mad if I though she was not yet am obliged to half hope she is not  Mil  Why  Har  What a question Am I not a profligate and in all probability ruinedNot even my father can overlook this last affairNoHeigho  Mil  The loss of my father's will and the mystery made of its contents by those who witnessed it are strange circumstances  Har  In which the widow triumphs And you being a bastard and left by law to starve she willingly pays obedience to laws so wise  Mil  She refuses even to pay my debts  Har  And the worthy alderman your father being overtaken by death in the south of France carefully makes a will and then as carefully hides it where it is not to be found or commits it to the custody of some mercenary knave who has made his market of it to the widowSo here comes the supposed executor of this supposed will  Enter Mr SULKY  My dear Mr Sulky how do you do  Sulky  Very ill  Har  Indeed I am very sorry What's your disorder  Sul  You  Har  Ha ha ha  Sul  Ruin bankruptcy infamy  Har  The old story  Sul  To a

ha ha Is the Bank of England ruined  Sul  I say ruined Nothing less than a miracle can save the house The purse of Fortunatus could not supply you  Har  No it held nothing but guineas notes bills paper for me  Sul  Such effrontery is insufferable For these five years sir you have been driving to ruin more furiously than  Har  An ambassadour's coach on a birth night I saw you were stammering for a simile  Sul  Sir  Har  Youth mounts the box seizes the reins and jehus headlong on in the dark Passion and Prodigality blaze in the front bewilder the coachman and dazzle and blind the passengers Wisdom Prudence and Virtue are overset and maimed or murdered and at last Repentance like the footman's flambeau lagging behind lights us to dangers when they are past all remedy  Sul  Your name is struck off the firm I was the adviser  Har  You are very kind Mr Sulky  Sul  Your father is at last determined  Har  Ha ha haDo you think so  Sul  You'll find so And what brought you here sir  Mil  A chaise and four  To Milford  Sul  It might have carried you to a safer place When do you mean to pay your debts  Mil  When my father's executor prevails on the widow Warren to do me justice  Sul  And which way am I to prevail  Mil  And which way am I to pay my debts  Sul  You might have more modesty than insolently to come and brave one of your principal creditors after having ruined his son by your evil counsel  Har  Ha ha haDon't believe a word on't my good grumbler I ruined myself I wanted no counsellor  Mil  My father died immensely rich and though I am what the law calls illegitimate I ought not to starve  Sul  You have had five thousand pounds and are five more in debt  Mil  Yes thanks to those who trust boys with thousands  Sul  You would do the same now you think yourself a man  Mil  Firmly  Indeed I would not  Sul  Had you been watching the widow at home instead of galloping after a knot of gamblers and pickpockets you might perhaps have done yourself more service  Mil  Which way sir  Sul  The will of your late father is found  Mil  Found  Sul  I have received a letter from which I learn it was at last discovered carefully locked up in a private drawer and that it is now a full month since a gentleman of Montpelier coming to England was entrusted with it But no such gentleman has yet appeared  Mil  If it should have got into the hands of the widow  Sul  Which I suspect it hasYou are a couple of pretty gentlemen But beware misfortune is at your heels Mr Dornton vows vengeance on you both and justly He is not gone to bed▪ and if you have confidence enough to look him in the face I would have you stay where you are  Mil  I neither wish to insult nor be insulted  Exit  Sul  Do you know sir your father turned the poor fellow into the street who compassionately opened the door for you  Har  Yes and my father knows I as compassionately opened the door for the poor fellow in return▪  Sul  Very well sirYour fame is increasing daily  Har  I am glad to hear it  Sul  Humph Then perhaps you have paragraphed yourself  Har  Paragraphed What Where  Sul  In the St James's Evening  Har  Me  Sul  Stating the exact amount  Har  Of my loss  Sul  YoursYou march through every avenue to fame dirty▪ or clean  Har  Well saidBe witty when you can sarcastic you must be in spite of your teeth But I like you the better You are honest you are my cruet of Cayenne and a sprinkling of you is excellent  Sul  Well sir when you know the state of your own affairs and to what you have reduced the house you will perhaps be less ready to grin  Har  Reduced the house ha ha ha  Enter Mr Dornton with the Newspaper in his hand  Dorn  So sir  Har  Bowing  I am happy to see you sir  Dorn  You are there after having broken into my house at midnightAnd you are here  pointing to the paper  after having ruined me and my house by your unprincipled prodigality Are you not a scoundrel  Har  No sir I am only a fool  Sul  Good night to you gentlemen  Dorn  Stay▪ where you are Mr Sulky I beg you to stay where you are and be a witness to my solemn renunciation of him and his vices  Sul  I have witnessed it a thousand times  Dorn  But this is the last Are you not a scoundrel I say  Har  I am your son  Dorn  calling  Mr Smith Bring in those deeds  Enter Mr SMITH  You will not deny you are an incorrigible squanderer  Har  I will deny nothing  Dorn  A nuisance a wart a blot a stain upon the face of nature  Har  A stain that will wash out sir  Dorn  A redundancy a negation a besotted sophisticated incumbrance a jumble of fatuity your head your heart your words your actions all a jargon incoherent and unintellegible to yourself absurd and offensive to others  Sul  The whirlwind is rising  Har  I am whatever you please sir  Dorn  Bills never examined every thing bought on credit the price of nothing asked conscious you were weak enough to wish for baubles you did not want and pant for pleasures you could not enjoy you had not the effrontery to assume the circumspect caution of common sense And to your other destructive follies you must add the detestable vice of gaming  Har  These things sir are much easier done than defended  Dorn  But hereGive me that parchment  To Mr Smith  The partners have all been summoned▪ Look sir Your name has been formally erased  Har  The partners are very kind  Dorn  The suspicions already incurred by the known profligacy of a principal in the firm the immensc sums you have drawn this paragraph the run on the house it will occasion the consternation of the whole city  Har  All very terrible and some of it very true  Half aside  Dorn  Passionately  Give me the will Mr Smith Give me the will Fond and foolish as I have been read and you will find I am at last restored to my sensesIf I should happily outlive the storm you have raised it shall not be to support a prodigal or to reward a gamblerYou are dis  heritedRead  Har  Your word is as good as the Bank sir  Dorn  I'll no longer act the doting father fascinated by your arts  Har  I never had any art sir except the one you taught me  Dorn  I taught you What Scoundrel What  Har  That of loving you sir  Dorn  Loving me  Har  Most sincerely  Dorn  Forgetting his passion  Why can you say HarryRascal I mean that you love me  Har  I should be a rascal indeed if I did not sir  Dorn  Harry Harry  Struggling with his feelings  No Confound me if I dosir you are a vile  Har  I know I am  Dorn  And I'll never speak to you more  Going  Har  Bid me good night sir Mr Sulky here will bid me good night and you are my fatherGood night Mr Sulky  Sul  Good night  Har  Come sir  Dorn  Struggling with passion  I won'tIf I do  Har  Reproach me with my follies strike out my name disinherit me I deserve it all and moreBut
