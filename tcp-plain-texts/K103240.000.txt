 TRACTS MATHEMATICAL AN  PHILOSOPHICAL  BY CHARLES HUTTON LL D  F R S OF LOND AND EDINB MEMB OF THE SOCIETY OF SCIENCES OF HOLLAND AND PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS IN THE ROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY WOOLWICH  LONDON PRINTED FOR G G J AND J ROBINSON PATERNOSTER ROW  MDCCLXXXVI  TO HIS GRACE CHARLES DUKE OF RICHMOND LENNOX AND AUBIGNY c c c  MASTER GENERAL OF THE ORDNANCE UNDER WHOSE AUSPICES THE EXPERIMENTS IN GUNNERY WERE MADE  THESE TRACTS ARE RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED BY  HIS GRACE'S MOST HUMBLE AND MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT THE AUTHOR  PREFACE  THE Author presumes to lay the following Tracts before the Public with the greater confidence as he hopes these productions of his leisure will be found to bear a due relation to the engagements of his official duty  The preference given of late even among professed philosophers to studies of a less abstract kind has too frequently diverted the pursuits of mathematicians into paths less suited to their talents from the desire of a vain and fleeting popularity instead of the more laudable ambition of making real improvements in the sciences which they had professed to cultivate The humble consciousness which the author has ever entertained of the limits of his own abilities has he hopes preserved him from this common and pernicious vanity However solicitous to extend and diver∣sify his own acquirements he can only hope to add and that a little to the public stock of knowledge in those parts of science to which his early  habits and subsequent occupations have led him peculiarly to conse∣create his studies  The very honourable distinction paid to the author by the Royal Society for his former experiments in gunnery as well as their general indulgence to his attempts in other mathematical subjects would perhaps have given an obvious destination to these papers had he not thought their publication in a collective form better adapted from the connec∣tion of their subject to extend their utility  The first six tracts in this volume will be found to have an obvious connection in respect to their subject having all of them a tendency either to illustrate the history or improve the theory of that species of mathematical quantities called Series The particular subjects of these tracts are sufficiently discussed in the introduction to each of them re∣spectively to render any previous detail unnecessary in this place The author hopes however they will be thought to have some claim to the merit of invention and that their utility will be readily recognized by those who are conversant in these subjects  The seventh and eighth tracts are rather detached in their nature re∣lating to subjects purely geometrical It is hoped however that the former of them being an investigation of some new and curious properties of the sphere and cone which have always been a fruitful and favourite source of exercise to geometricians will be both acceptable and useful  to those who are engaged in similar speculations The latter problem concerning the geometrical division of a circle having hitherto been deemed impracticable the solution of it is here given it is presumed for the first time  The largest and in the author's opinion the most important of these tracts is the ninth or last the main purpose of which is altogether practical though founded in a very subtle and complex theory  Though the late excellent Mr Robins first shewed the importance of this theory and invented a very curious mechanical apparatus for the experiments which he made to verify it the author is persuaded that none have been hitherto made with cannon balls so completely as those here related and described and that these are the first from which the  Data  for determining the resistance of the medium can be accurately derived It has been the author's great object next to the accuracy of the experiments and the full and precise description of them to simplify the theorems deduced from them or from the theory itself of which an example may be found in the new rule given for the velocity of the ball And it is presumed that the table of the corresponding  Data  namely of the Dimensions and Elevation of the gun and the Range Velocity and Time of slight of the ball is now so accurately framed and so perspicuous that the several cases of gunnery may be very certainly and easily referred to it and rules of practice adapted to the common purposes of the artillerist may be very readily formed upon these principles  MATHEMATICAL TRACTS c  TRACT I  A Dissertation on the Nature and Value of Infinite Series  ABOUT five years since I discovered a very general and easy method of valuing series whose terms are alternately positive and negative which equally applies to such series whether they be converging or diverging or their terms all equal together with seve∣ral other properties relating to certain series and as we shall have occasion to deliver some of those matters in the course of these tracts I shall take this opportunity of premising a few ideas and remarks on the nature and valuation of some of the classes of series which form the object of those communications This is done with a view to obviate  any misconceptions that might perhaps be made concerning the idea annexed to the term  value  of such series in those intended tracts and the sense in which it is there always to be understood which is the more necessary as many controversies have been warmly agitated concerning these matters not only of late by some of our own countrymen but also by others among the ablest mathematicians in Europe at different periods in the course of the present century and all this it seems through the want of specifying in what sense the term  value  or  sum  was to be understood in their dissertations And in this discourse I shall follow in a great measure the sentiments and manner of the late famous L Euler contained in a similar memoir of his in the fifth volume of the New Petersburgh Commentaries adding and intermix∣ing here and there other remarks and observations of my own  By a converging series I mean such a one whose terms continually decrease and by a diverging series that whose terms continually in∣crease So that a series whose terms neither increase nor decrease but are all equal as they neither converge nor diverge may be called a neutral series as  a    a  +  a    a  + c Now converging series being supposed infinitely continued may have their terms decreasing to o as a limit as the series ½ + ⅓ ¼ + c or only decreasing to some finite magnitude as a limit as the series + + c which tends continually to as a limit So in like manner diverging series may have their terms tending to a limit that is either finite or infinitely great thus the terms + + c diverge to infinity but the diverging terms ½ ⅔ + ¾ ⅘ + c only to the finite magnitude Hence then as the ultimate terms of series which do not converge to o by supposing them continued  in infinitum  may be either finite or infinite there will be two kinds of such series each of which will be farther divided into two species according as the terms shall either be all affected with the same sign or have alternately the signs + and We shall therefore have altogether four species of series which do not converge to o an example of each of which may be as here follows  I + + + + + + c  I ½ + ⅔ + ¾ + ⅘ + ⅚ + + c  II + + + c  II ½ ⅔ + ¾ ⅘ + ⅚ + c  III + + + + + + c  III + + + + + + c  IV + + + c  IV + + + c  Now concerning the sums of these species of series there have been great dissensions among mathematicians some affirming that they can be expressed by a certain sum while others deny it In the first place however it is evident that the sums of such series as come under the first of these species will be really infinitely great since by actually collecting the terms we can arrive at a sum greater than any proposed number whatever and hence there can be no doubt but that the sums of this species of series may be exhibited by expressions of this kind  a      It is concerning the other species therefore that mathe∣maticians have chiefly differed and the arguments which both sides allege in defence of their opinions have been endued with such force that neither party could hitherto be brought to yield to the other  As to the second species the famous Leibnitz was one of the first who treated of this series + + + c and he concluded the sum of it to = ½ relying upon the following cogent reasons And first that this series arises by resolving the fraction +  a  into the series  a  +  a      a    +  a      a    + c by continual division in the usual way and taking the value of  a  equal to unity Secondly for more confirmation and for persuading such as are not accustomed to cal∣culations he reasons in the following manner If the series terminate any where and if the number of the terms be even then its value will be =  but if the number of terms be odd the value of the series will be = but because the series proceeds  in infinitum  and that the number of the terms cannot be reckoned either odd or even we may conclude that the sum is neither = nor = but that it must obtain a certain middle value equidifferent from both and which is therefore = ½ And thus he adds nature adheres to the universal law of justice giving no partial preference to either side  Against these arguments the adverse party make use of such objec∣tions as the following First that the fraction +  a  is not equal to the infinite series  a  +  a      a    + c unless  a  be a fraction less than unity For if the division be any where broken off and the quotient of the remainder be added the cause of the paralogism will be mani∣fest for we shall then have  and that although the number  n  should be made infi∣nite yet the supplemental fraction  ought not to be omitted unless it should become evanescent which happens only in those cases in which  a  is less than and the terms of the series converge to But that in other cases there ought always to be included this kind of supplement  and although it be affected with the dubious sign  namely or + according as  n  shall be an even or an odd number yet if  n  be infinite it may not therefore be omitted under the pretence that an infinite number is neither odd nor even and that there is no reason why the one sign should be used rather than the other for it is absurd to suppose that there can be any integer number even although it be infinite which is neither odd nor even  But this objection is rejected by those who attribute determinate sums to diverging series because it considers an infinite number as a determinate number and therefore either odd or even when it is really  indeterminate For that it is contrary to the very idea of a series said to proceed  in infinitum  to conceive any term of it as the last although infinite and that therefore the objection abovementioned of the supplement to be added or subtracted naturally falls of itself Therefore since an infinite series never terminates we never can arrive at the place where that supplement must be joined and therefore that the supplement not only may but indeed ought to be neglected because there is no place found for it  And these arguments adduced either for or against the sums of such series as above hold also in the fourth species which is not otherwise embarrassed with any further doubts peculiar to itself  But those who dispute against the sums of such series think they have the firmest hold in the third species For although the terms of these series continually increase and that by actually collect∣ing the terms we can arrive at a sum greater than any assignable num∣ber which is the very definition of infinity yet the patrons of the sums are forced to admit in this species series whose sums are not only finite but even negative or less than nothing For since the fraction  a  •  by evolving it by division becomes +  a  +  a    +  a    +  a    + c we should have  = = + + + + + c  = ½ = + + + + + c  which their adversaries not undeservedly hold to be absurd since by the addition of affirmative numbers we can never obtain a negative sum and hence they urge that there is the greater necessity for includ∣ing the beforementioned supplement additive since by taking it in it is evident that = + + +  n  +  n  + although  n  should be an infinite number  The defenders therefore of the sums of such series in order to reconcile this striking paradox more subtle perhaps than true make a distinction between negative quantities for they argue that while some are less than nothing there are others greater than infinite or above infinity Namely that the one value of ought to be understood when it is conceived to arise from the subtraction of a greater number  a  + from a less  a  but the other value when it is found equal to the series + + + + c and arising from the division of the number by for that in the former case it is less than nothing but in the latter greater than infinite For the more confirmation they bring this example of fractions ¼ ⅓ ½ c which evidently increasing in the leading terms it is inferred will con∣tinually increase and hence they conclude that is greater than and greater than and so on and therefore as is expressed by and by ∼ or infinity will be greater than ∼ and much more will ½ be greater than ∼ And thus they ingeniously enough repel∣led that apparent absurdity by itself  But although this distinction seemed to be ingeniously devised it gave but little satisfaction to the adversaries and besides it seemed to affect the truth of the rules of algebra For if the two values of namely and be really different from each other as we may not confound them the certainty and the use of the rules which we follow in making calculations would be quite done away which would be a greater absurdity than that for whose sake the distinction was devised but if = as the rules of algebra require for by multiplication  the matter in debate is not settled since the quantity to which the series + + + + c is made equal is less than nothing and therefore the same difficulty still remains In the mean time however it seems but agreeable to truth to say that the same quantities which are below nothing may be  taken as above infinite For we know not only from algebra but from geometry also that there are two ways by which quantities pass from positive to negative the one through the cypher or nothing and the other through infinity and besides that quantities either by in∣creasing or decreasing from the cypher return again and revert to the same term o so that quantities more than infinite are the same with quantities less than nothing like as quantities less than infinite agree with quantities greater than nothing  But farther those who deny the truth of the sums that have been assigned to diverging series not only omit to assign other values for the sums but even set themselves utterly to oppose all sums belong∣ing to such series as things merely imaginary For a converging series as suppose this + ½ + ¼ + ⅛ + c will admit of a sum = because the more terms of this series we actually add the nearer we come to the number but in diverging series the case is quite different for the more terms we add the more do the sums which are produced differ from one another neither do they ever tend to any certain deter∣minate value Hence they conclude that no idea of a sum can be applied to diverging series and that the labour of those persons who employ themselves in investigating the sums of such series is manifestly useless and indeed contrary to the very principles of analysis  But notwithstanding this seemingly real difference yet neither party could ever convict the other of any error whenever the use of series of this kind has occurred in analysis and for this good reason that neither party is in an error but that the whole difference consists in words only For if in any calculation I arrive at this series + + c and that I substitute ½ instead of it I shall surely not thereby commit any error which however I should certainly incur if I substitute any other number instead of that series and hence there remains no doubt but that the series + + c and the  fraction ½ are equivalent quantities and that the one may always be substituted instead of the other without error So that the whole mat∣ter in dispute seems to be reduced to this only namely whether the fraction ½ can be properly called the  sum  of the series + + c Now if any persons should obstinately deny this since they will not however venture to deny the fraction to be equivalent to the series it is greatly to be feared they will fall into mere quarrelling about words  But perhaps the whole dispute will easily be compromised by carefully attending to what follows Whenever in analysis we arrive at a complex function or expression either fractional or transcendental it is usual to convert it into a convenient series to which the remaining calculus may be more easily applied And hence the occasion and rise of infinite series So far only then do infinite series take place in analytics as they arise from the evolution of some finite expression and therefore instead of an infinite series in any calculus we may substitute that formula from whose evolution it arose And hence for performing calculations with more ease or more benefit like as rules are usually given for converting into infinite series such finite expressions as are endued with less proper forms so on the other hand those rules are to be esteemed not less useful by the help of which we may investi∣gate the finite expression from which a proposed infinite series would result if that finite expression should be evolved by the proper rules and since this expression may always without error be substituted in∣stead of the infinite series they must necessarily be of the same value and hence no infinite series can be proposed but a finite expression may at the same time be conceived as equivalent to it  If therefore we only so far change the received notion of a sum as to say that the sum of any series is the finite expression by the evolution of which that series may be produced all the difficulties  which have been agitated on both sides vanish of themselves For first that expression by whose evolution a converging series is produced exhibits at the same time its sum in the common acceptation of the term neither if the series should be divergent could the investiga∣tion be deemed at all more absurd or less proper namely the search∣ing out a finite expression which being evolved according to the rules of algebra shall produce that series And since that expression may be substituted in the calculation instead of this series there can be no doubt but that it is equal to it Which being the case we need not necessarily deviate from the usual mode of speaking but might be per∣mitted to call that expression also the  sum  which is  equal  to any series whatever provided however that in series whose terms do not con∣verge to o we do not connect that notion with this idea of a sum namely that the more terms of the series are actually collected the nearer we must approach to the value of the sum  But if any person shall still think it improper to apply the term sum to the finite expressions by whose evolution all series in general are produced it will make no difference in the nature of the thing and instead of the word sum for such finite expression he may use the term value or perhaps the term  radix  would be as proper as any other that could be employed for this purpose as the series may justly be considered as issuing or growing out of it like as a plant springs from its root or from its seed The choice of terms being in a great mea∣sure arbitrary every person is at liberty to employ them in whatever sense he may think fit or proper for the purpose in hand provided always that he fix and determine the sense in which he understands or employs them And as I consider any series and the finite expression by whose evolution that series may be produced as no more than two different ways of expressing one and the same thing whether that finite expression be called the sum or value or radix of the series so in the following paper and in some others which may perhaps hereafter  be produced it is in this sense I desire to be understood when searching out the value of series namely that the object of my enquiry is the radix by whose evolution the series may be produced or else an ap∣proximation to the value of it in decimal numbers c  Royal Military Acad Woolwich  May  TRACT II  A new Method for the Valuation of Numeral Infinite Series whose Terms are alternately + Plus and Minus by taking continual Arith∣metical Means between the Successive Sums and their Means  Article THE remarkable difference between the facility which mathematicians have found in their endeavours to determine the values of infinite series whose terms are alternately affirmative and negative and the difficulty of doing the same thing with respect to those series whose terms are all affirmative is one of those striking appearances in science which we can hardly persuade our∣selves is true even after we have seen many proofs of it and which serve to put us ever after on our guard not to trust to our first notions or conjectures on these subjects till we have brought them to the test of demonstration For at first sight it is very natural to imagine that those infinite series whose terms are all affirmative or added to the first term must be much simpler in their nature and much easier to be summed than those whose terms are alternately affirmative and ne∣gative which nevertheless we find upon examination to be directly contrary to the truth the methods of finding the sums of the latter series being numerous and easy and also very general whereas those that have been hitherto discovered for the summation of the former series are few and difficult and confined to series whose terms are generated from each other according to some particular laws instead of extending as the other methods do to all sorts of series whose terms are connected together by addition by whatever law their terms are formed Of this remarkable difference between these two sorts of series the new method of finding the sums of those whose terms are  alternately positive and negative which is the subject of the present paper will afford us a striking instance as it possesses the happy qua∣lities of simplicity ease perspicuity and universality in a great degree and yet as the essence of it consists in the alternation of the signs + and by which the terms are connected with the first term it is of no use in the summation of those other series whose terms are all con∣nected with each other by the sign +  This method so easy and general is in short simply this be∣ginning at the first term  a  of the series  a    b  +  c    d  +  e    f  + c which is to be summed compute several successive values of it by taking in successively more and more terms one term being taken in at a time so that the first value of the series shall be its first term  a  or even  o  or nothing may begin the series of sums the next value shall be its first two terms  a    b  reduced to one number its next value shall be the first three terms  a    b  +  c  reduced to one number its next value shall be the first four terms  a    b  +  c    d  reduced also to one number and so on This it is evident may be done by means of the easy arithmetical operation of addition and subtraction And then having found a sufficient number of successive values of the series more or less as the case may require interpose between these values a set of arithmetical mean quantities or proportionals and between these arithmetical means interpose a second set of arithmetical mean quanti∣ties and between those arithmetical means of the second set inter∣pose a third set of arithmetical mean quantities and so on as far as you please By this process we soon find either the true value of the series proposed when it has a determinate rational value or otherwise we obtain several sets of values approximating nearer and nearer to the sum of the series both in the columns and in the lines either horizon∣tal or obliquely descending or ascending namely both of the several sets of means themselves and the sets or series formed of any of their corresponding terms as of all their first terms of their second terms  of their third terms c or of their last terms of their penultimate terms of their antepenultimate terms c and if between any of these latter sets consisting of the like or corresponding terms of the former sets of arithmetical means we again interpose new sets of arithmetical means as we did at first with the successive sums we shall obtain other sets of approximating terms having the same properties as the former And thus we may repeat the process as often as we please which will be found very useful in the more difficult diverging series as we shall see hereafter For this method being derived only from the circum∣stance of the alternation of the signs of the terms + and it is there∣fore not confined to converging series alone but is equally applicable both to diverging series and to  neutral  series by which last name I shall take the liberty to distinguish those series whose terms are all of the same constant magnitude namely the application is equally the same for all the three following sorts of series viz  Converging ½ + ⅓ ¼ + ⅕ ⅙ + c  Diverging + + + c  Neutral + + + c  As is demonstrated in what follows and exemplified in a variety of instances  It must be noted however that by the value of the series I always mean such  radix  or finite expression as by evolution would produce the series in question according to the sense I have stated in the former paper on this subject or an approximate value of such radix and which radix as it may be substituted instead of the series in any operation I call the value of the series  It is an obvious and wellknown property of infinite series with alternate signs that when we seek their value by collecting their terms one after another we obtain a series of successive sums which approach continually nearer and nearer to the true value of the proposed series when it is a converging one or one whose terms always decrease  by some regular law but in a diverging series or one whose terms as continually increase those successive sums diverge always more and more from the true value of the series And from the circumstance of the alternate change of the signs it is also a property of those suc∣cessive sums that when the last term which is included in the collection is a positive one then the sum obtained is too great or exceeds the truth but when the last collected term is negative then the sum is too little or below the truth So that in both the converging and diverging series the first term alone being positive exceeds the truth the second sum or the sum of the first two terms is below the truth the third sum or the sum of three terms is above the truth the fourth sum or the sum of four terms is below the truth and so on the sum of any even number of terms being below the true value of the series and the sum of any odd number above it All which is generally known and evident from the nature and form of the series So of the series  a    b  +  c    d  +  e    f  + c the first sum  a  is too great the second sum  a    b  too little the third sum  a    b  +  c  too great and so on as in the following table where  s  is the true value of the series and o is placed before the collected sums to compleat the series being the value when no terms are included     Successive sums  s  is greater than  o  s  is less than  a  s  is greater than  a    b  s  is less than  a    b  +  c  s  is greater than  a    b  +  c    d  s  is less than  a    b  +  c    d  +  e  c  c  Hence the value of every alternate series  s  is positive and less than the first term  a  the series being always supposed to begin with a positive term  a  and consequently if the signs of all the terms be  changed or if the series begin with a negative term the value  s  will still be the same but negative or the sign of the sum will be changed and the value become  s  =  a  +  b    c  +  d  c Also because the successive sums in a converging series always ap∣proach nearer and nearer to the true value while they recede always farther and farther from it in a diverging series it follows that in a neutral series  a    a  +  a    a  + c which holds a middle place between the two former the successive sums o  a  o  a  o  a  c will neither converge nor diverge but will be always at the same dis∣tance from the value of the proposed series  a    a  +  a    a  + c and consequently that value will always be = ½  a  which holds every where the middle place between o and  a  Now with respect to a converging series  a    b  +  c    d  + c because o is below and  a  above  s  the value of the series but  a  nearer than o to the value  s  it follows that  s  lies between  a  and ½  a  and that ½  a  is less than  s  and so nearer to  s  than o is In like manner be∣cause  a  is above and  a    b  below the value  s  but  a    b  nearer to that value than  a  is it follows that  s  lies between  a  and  a    b  and that the arithmetical mean  a  ½  b  is something above the value of  s  but nearer to that value than  a  is And thus the same reasoning holding in every following pair of successive sums the arithmetical means between them will form another series of terms which are like those sums alternately less and greater than the value of the pro∣posed series but approximating nearer to that value than the several successive sums do as every term of those means is nearer to the value  s  than the corresponding preceding term in the sums is And like as the successive sums form a progression approaching always nearer and nearer to the value of the series so in like manner their arithmetical means form another progression coming nearer and nearer to the same value and each term of the progression of means nearer than each term of the successive sums Hence then we have the two following  series namely of successive sums and their arithmetical means in which each step approaches nearer to the value of  s  than the former the latter progression being however nearer than the former and the terms or steps of each alternately below and above the value  s  of the series  a    b  +  c    d  + c  Successive sums  Arithmetical means  › O  › ½  a  ‹  a  ‹  a  ½  b  ›  a    b  ›  a    b  + ½  c  ‹  a    b  +  c  ‹  a    b  +  c  ½  d  ›  a    b  +  c    d  ›  a    b  +  c    d  + ½  e  ‹  a    b  +  c    d  +  e  ‹  a    b  +  c    d  +  e  ½  f  c  c  where the mark › placed before any step signifies that it is too little or below the value  s  of the converging series  a    b  +  c    d  + c and the mark ‹ signifies the contrary or too great And hence ½  a  or half the first term of such a converging series is less than  s  the value of the series  And since these two progressions possess the same properties but only the terms of the latter nearer to the truth than the former for the very same reasons as before the means between the terms of these first arithmetical means will form a third progression whose terms will approach still nearer to the value of  s  than the second progression or the first means and the means of these second means will approach nearer than the said second means do and so on continually every succeeding order of arithmetical means approaching nearer to the value of  s  than the former So that the following columns of sums and means will be each nearer to the value of  s  than the former viz     Suc sums  st means  d means  d means  th means  ›    a      a    b      a    b  +  c      a    b  +  cc    d    ‹  a  a    b    a    b    c    a    b    c  +  d    a    b    c  +  d    e    ›  a    b  a    b  +  c    a    b  +  c    d    a    b  +  c    d  +  e    a    b  +  c    d  +  e    f    ‹  a    b  +  c  a    b  +  c    d    a    b  +  c    d    c    a    b  +  c  c  a    b  + c  ›  a    b  +  c    d  a    b  +c  a    b  +c  a    b  +c  a    b  + c  Where every column consists of a set of quantities approaching still nearer and nearer to the value of  s  the terms of each column being alternately below and above that value and each succeeding column approaching nearer than the preceding one Also every line formed of all the first terms all the second terms all the third terms c of the columns forms also a progression whose terms continually approximate to the value of  s  and each line nearer or quicker than the former but differing from the columns or vertical progressions in this namely that whereas the terms in the columns are alternately below and above the value of  s  those in each line are all on one side of the value  s  namely either all below or all above it and the lines alternately too little and too great namely all the expressions in the first line too little all those in the second line too great those in the third line too little and so on every odd line being too little and every even line too great  Hence the expressions  a    a    b    a    b  +  c    a    b  +  c    a    a    b  +  c    d  +  e  c are continual approximations to the value  s  of the converging series  a    b  +  c    d  +  e  c and are all below the truth But we can easily express all these several theorems by one general formula For since it is evident by the construction that whilst the denominator in any one of them is some power  n  of or + the numeral coefficients  of  a b c  c the terms in the numerator are found by subtracting all the terms except the last term one after another from the said power  n  or  which is = +  n  +  n  ·  n  +  n  ·  n  + c namely the coefficient of  a  equal to all the terms  n  minus the first term that of  b  equal to all except the first two terms +  n  that of  c  equal to all except the first three and so on till the coeffi∣cient of the last term be = the last term of the power it follows that the general expression for the several theorems or the general ap∣proximate value of the converging series  a    b  +  c    d  + c will be  continued till the terms vanish and the series break off  n  being equal to o or any integer number Or this general formula may be expressed by this series  where A B C c denote the coefficients of the several preceding terms And this expression which is always too little is the nearer to the true value of the series  a    b  +  c    d  + c as the number  n  is taken greater always excepting however those cases in which the theorem is accurately true when  n  is some certain finite number Also with any value of  n  the formula is nearer to the truth as the terms  a b c  c of the proposed series are nearer to equality so that the slower the proposed series converges the more accurate is the formula and the sooner does it afford a near value of that series which is a very fa∣vourable circumstance as it is in cases of very slow convergency that approximating formulae are chiefly wanted And like as the formula approaches nearer to the truth as the terms of the series approach to an equality so when the terms become quite equal as in a neutral series the formula becomes quite accurate and always gives the same value ½  a  for  s  or the series whatever integer number be taken for  n  And farther when the proposed series from being converging passes through  neutrality when its terms are equal and becomes diverging the for∣mula will still hold good only it will then be alternately too great and too little as long as the series diverges as we shall presently shew more fully So that in general the value  s  of the series  a    b  +  c    d  + c whether it be converging diverging or neutral is less than the first term  a  when the series converges the value is above ½  a  when it diverges it is below ½  a  and when neutral it is equal to ½  a  Take now the series of the first terms of the several orders of arithmetical means which form the progression of continual approxi∣mating formulae being each nearer to the value of the series  a    b  +  c    d  + c than the former and place them in a column one under another then take the differences between every two adjacent formulae and place in another column by the side of the former as here below  Approx Formulae  Differences  a    a    b      a    b    a    b  +  c      a    b  +  c    a    b  +  c    d      a    b  +  c    d    a    b  +  c    d  +  e      a    b  +  c    d  +  e       c  c  From which it appears that this series of differences consists of the very same quantities which form the first terms of all the orders of differ∣ences of the terms of the proposed series  a    b  +  c    d  + c when taken as usual in the differential method And because the first of the above differences added to the first formula gives the second formula and the second difference added to the second formula gives the third formula and so on therefore the first formula with all the differences added will give the last formula consequently our general formula  which approaches to the value of the series  a    b  +  c    d  + c is also equivalent to or reduces to this form  which it is evident agrees with the famous differential series And this coincidence might be sufficient to establish the truth of our method though we had not given other more direct proof of it Hence it ap∣pears then that our theorem is of the same degree of accuracy or convergency as the differential theorem but admits of more direct and easy application as the terms themselves are used without the pre∣vious trouble of taking the several orders of differences And our method will be rendered general for literal as well as numeral series by supposing  a b c  c to represent not barely the coefficients of the terms but the whole terms both the numeral and the literal part of them However as the chief use of my method is to obtain the nu∣meral value of series when a literal series is to be so summed it is to be made numeral by substituting the numeral values of the letters in∣stead of them It is farther evident that we might easily derive our method of arithmetical means from the above differential series by beginning with it and receding back to our theorems by a counter process to that above given  Having in Art compleated the investigations for the first or converging form of series the first four articles being introduc∣tory to both forms in common we may now proceed to the diverging form of series for which we shall find the same method of arithmetical means and the same general formula as for the converging series as well as the mode of investigation used in Art  et seq  only changing sometimes greater for less or less for greater Thus then reasoning from the table of successive sums in Art in which  s  is alternately above and below the expressions o  a a    b a    b  +  c  c be∣cause o is below and  a  above the value  s  of the series  a    b  +  c    d  + c but o nearer than  a  to that value it follows that  s  lies be∣tween  o and ½  a  and that ½  a  is greater than  s  but nearer to  s  than  a  is In like manner because  a  is above and  a    b  below the value  s  but  a  nearer to that value than  a    b  is it follows that  s  lies between  a  and  a    b  and that the arithmetical mean  a  ½  b  is below  s  but that it is nearer to  s  than  a    b  is And thus the same reasoning holding in every pair of successive sums the arithmetical means between them will form another series of terms which are alternately greater and less than  s  the value of the proposed series but here greater and less in the con∣trary way to what they were for the converging series namely those steps greater here which were less there and less here which before were greater And this first set of arithmetical means will either con∣verge to the value of  s  or will at least diverge less from it than the progression of successive sums Again the same reasoning still hold∣ing good by taking the arithmetical means of those first means another set is found which will either converge or else diverge less than the former And so on as far as we please every new operation gradually checking the first or greatest divergency till a number of the first terms of a set converge sufficiently fast to afford a near value of  s  the pro∣posed series  Or by taking the first terms of all the orders of means we find the same set of theorems namely  c or in general  which will be alternately above and below  s  the value of the series till the divergency is overcome Then this series which consists of the first terms of the several orders of means may be treated as the successive sums taking several orders of means of these again After which the first terms of these last orders may be treated again in the same manner and so on as far as we please Or the series of second terms or third terms c or sometimes the terms ascending ob∣liquely may be treated in the same manner to advantage And  with a little practice and inspection of the several series whether vertical or horizontal or oblique for they all tend to the detection of the same value  s  we shall soon learn to distinguish whereabouts the required quantity  s  is and which of the series will soonest approxi∣mate to it  To exemplify now this method we shall take a few series of both sorts and find their value sometimes by actually going through the operations of taking the several orders of arithmetical means and at other times by using some one of the theorems  c at once And to render the use of these theorems still easier we shall here sub∣join the following table where the first line consisting of the powers of contains the denominators of the theorems in their order and the figures in their perpendicular columns below them are the coefficients of the several terms in the numerators of the theorems namely the upper figure next below the power of the coefficient of  a  the next below that of  b  the third that of  c  c                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The construction and continuation of this table is a business of little labour For the numbers in the first horizontal line next below the line of the powers of are those powers diminished each by unity The numbers in the next horizontal line are made from the numbers in the first by subtracting from each the index of that power of which stands above it And for the rest of the table the formation of it is obvious from this principle which reigns through the whole that every number in it is the sum of two others namely of the next to it on the left in the same horizontal line and the next above that in the same vertical column So that the whole table is formed from a few of its initial numbers by easy operations of addition  In converging series it will be farther useful first to collect a few of the initial terms into one sum and then apply our method to the fol∣lowing terms which will be sooner valued because they will converge slower  For the first example let us take the very slowly converging series ½ + ⅓ ¼ + ⅕ ⅙ + c which is known to express the hyp log of which is =  Here  a  =  b  = ½  c  = ⅓  d  = ¼ c and the value as found by theorem the st d d th th and th will be thus  st  a  = ½ =  d    d    th    th    th    Where it is evident that every theorem gives always a nearer value than the former the th theorem gives the value true to the th  figure and the th theorem to the th figure The operation for the th and th theorems will be easily performed by dividing mentally the numbers in their respective columns in the table of coefficients in Art by the ordinate numbers c placing the quotients of the alternate terms below each other then adding each up and dividing the difference of the sums continually five or ten times successively by the number after the manner as here placed below where the operation is set down for both of them  For the th Theorem  For the th Theorem  Again to perform the operation by taking the successive sums and the arithmetical means let the terms ½ ⅓ ¼ c be reduced to decimal numbers by dividing the common numerator by the deno∣minators c or rather by taking these out of the table at the end of my  Miscellanea Mathematica  published in which con∣tains a table of the square roots and reciprocals of all the numbers  c to and which is of great use in such calculations as these Then the operation will stand thus  Here after collecting the first twelve terms I begin at the bottom and ascending upwards take a very few arithmetical means between the successive sums placing them on the right of them it being unne∣cessary to take the means of the whole as any part of them will do the business but the lower ones in a converging series best because they are nearer the value sought and approach sooner to it I then take the means of the first means and the means of these again and so on till the value is obtained as near as may be necessary In this process we soon distinguish whereabouts the value lies the limits or means which are alternately above and below it gradually contracting and approaching towards each other And when the means are reduced to a single one and it is found necessary to get the value more exactly I then go back to the columns of successive sums and find another first mean either next below or above those before found and continue it through the d d c means which makes now a duplicate in the last column of means and the mean between them gives another single mean of the next order and so on as far as we see it necessary By such a gradual progress we use no more terms nor labour than is quite requisite for the degree of accuracy required  Or after having collected the sum of any number of terms we may apply any of the formulae to the following terms So having as above  found for the sum of the first terms and calling the next or th term =  a  the th term =  b  the next c =  c  and so on then the d theorem  a    b  gives which added to the sum of the first terms gives the value of the series true in three places of figures and the d theorem  gives for the following terms and which added to the sum of the first terms gives the value of the series true in five places And so on  For a second example let us take the slowly converging series + + + c which is = ½ + hyp log of = Then  Here after the d column of means the first four figures which are common are omitted to save room and the trouble of writing them so often down and in the last three columns the process is repeated with the last three figures of each number and the last of these joined to the first four give for the value of the series proposed And the same value is also obtained by the theorems used as in the former example  For the third example let us take the converging series ⅓ + ⅕ + + c which is = c or ¼ of the circumference of the circle whose diameter is Here  a  =  b  = ⅓  c  = ⅕ c then turning the terms into decimals and proceeding with the successive sums and means as before we obtain the th mean true within a unit in the th place as here below  To find the value of the converging series  which occurs in the expression for determining the time of a body's descent down the arc of a circle  The first terms of this series I find ready computed by Mr Baron Maseres pa Philos Trans these being arranged under one another and the sums collected c as before give for the value of that series being only too little in the last figure  To find the value of ¼ + ½ + c con∣sisting of the reciprocals of the natural series of square numbers  The last mean is true in the last figure the more accurate value of the series ¼ + + c being c  Let the diverging series ½ ⅔ + ¾ ⅘ + c be proposed where the terms are the reciprocals of those in Art  Here the successive sums are alternately + and as well as the terms themselves of the proposed series but all the arithmetical means are positive The numbers in each column of means are alter∣nately too great and too little but so as visibly to approach towards each other The same mutual approximation is visible in all the oblique lines from left to right so that there is a general and mutual tendency in all the columns and in all the lines to the limit of the value of the series But with this difference that all the numbers in any line de∣scending obliquely from left to right are on one side of the limit and  those in the next line in the same direction all on the other side the one line having its numbers all too great while those in the next line are all too little but on the contrary the lines which ascend from below obliquely towards the right have their numbers alternately too great and too little after the manner of those in the columns but ap∣proximating quicker than those in the columns So that after having continued the columns of arithmetical means to any convenient extent we may then select the terms in the last or any other line obliquely ascending from left to right or rather beginning with the last found mean on the right and descending towards the left then arrange those terms below one another in a column and take their continual arithme∣tical means like as was done with the first successive sums to such extent as the case may require And if neither these new columns nor the oblique lines approach near enough to each other a new set may be formed from one of their oblique lines which has its terms alternately too great and too little And thus we may proceed as far as we please These repetitions will be more necessary in treating series which diverge more and having here once for all described the properties attending the series with the method of repetition we shall only have to refer to them as occasion shall offer In the present instance the last two or three means vary or differ so little that the limit may be concluded to lie nearly in the middle between them and therefore the mean between the two last and namely may be concluded to be very near the truth in the last three figures for as to the first three figures I dropt the repetition of them after the first three columns of means both to save space and the trouble of writing them so often over again So that the value of the series in question may be concluded to be very nearly which is = ½ + the hyp log of or less than its reciprocal series in Art  Take the diverging series ·· + ···· ······ + c Here first using some of the formulae we have by the  st  a  =  d  d  th  th  c  Or thus taking the several orders of means c  Here the successive sums are alternately + and but the arithme∣tical means are all + After the second column of means the first two figures are omitted being common and in the last three columns the first three figures which are common are omitted Towards the end all the numbers both oblique and vertical approach so near together that we may conclude that the last three figures are all true and these being joined to the first three we have for the value of the series which is otherwise found +√ = c  Let us take the diverging series        +        + c or + + c or ½ + ⅓ ¼ + ⅕ ⅙ + c  After the second column of means the first four figures are omitted being common to all the following columns to these annexing the last three figures of the last mean we have for the sum of the series which we otherwise know is equal to + hyp log of See Simp Dissert Ex p and  And the same value might be obtained by means of the formulae using them as before  Taking the diverging series + + c the method of means gives us  Where the second and every succeeding column of means gives ¼ for the value of the series proposed  In like manner using the theorems the first gives ½ but the second third fourth c give each of them the same value ¼ thus  a  = ½  c  Taking the series + + + c whose terms consist of the squares of the natural series of numbers we have by the arithmetical means  Where it is only in the second column of means that the divergency is counteracted after that the third and all the other orders of means give o for the value of the series + + c  The same thing takes place on using the formulae for  a  = ½  where the third and all after it give the same value  Taking the geometrical series of terms + + c then  Here the lower parts of all the columns of means from the cipher downwards consist of the same series of terms + + + + + c and the other part of the columns from the cipher upwards as well as each line of oblique means parallel to and above the line of ciphers forms a series of terms ½ ¼ ⅜ ⅓ ·  n  ±  n  alternately above and below the value of the series ⅓ and approaching continually nearer and nearer to it and which when infinitely continued or when  n  is infinite the term becomes ⅓ for the value of the geometrical series + + c  And the same set of terms would be given by each of the formulae  Take the geometrical series + + c Then  Here the column of successive sums and every second column of the arithmetical means below the o consists of the same series of terms + + c whilst all the other columns of means consist of this other set of terms ½ ½ + ½ ½ + c also the first oblique line of means ½ ½ ½ c consists of the terms ½ and alternately which are all at equal distance from the value of the series proposed + + c as indeed are the terms of all the other oblique descending lines And the mean between every two terms gives ¼ for that value And the same terms would be given by the formulae namely alternately ½ and  And thus the value of any geometrical series whose ratio or second term is  r  will be found to be = +  r  Finally let there be taken the hypergeometrical series + + + c = A + B C + D E + c which difficult series has been honoured by a very considerable memoir written upon the valuation of it by the late famous L Euler in the New Petersburg Commentaries vol v where the value of it is at length determined to be c  To simplify this series let us omit the first two terms = which will not alter the value and divide the remaining terms by and the quotients will give + + + c which being half the proposed series ought to have for its value the half of c namely nearly  Now ranging the terms in a column and taking the sums and means as usual we have  Where it is evident that the diverging is somewhat diminished but not quite counteracted in the columns and oblique descending lines from beginning to end as the terms in those directions still increase though not quite so fast as the original series and that the signs of the same terms are alternately + and while those of the terms in the other lines obliquely ascending from left to right are alternately one line all + and another line all and these terms continually decreasing The terms in the oblique descending lines being alternately too great and too little are the fittest to proceed with again Take therefore any one of those lines as suppose the first and ranging it vertically take the means as before and they will approach nearer to the value of the series thus  Here the same approximation in the lines and columns towards the value of the series is observable again only in a higher degree also the terms in the columns and oblique descending lines are again alter∣nately too great and too little but now within narrower limits and the signs of the terms are more of them positive also the terms in each oblique ascending line are still either all above or all below the value of the series and that alternately one line after another as before But the descending lines will again be the fittest to use because the terms in each are alternately above and below the value sought Tak∣ing therefore again the first of these oblique descending lines treat it as before and we shall obtain sets of terms approaching still nearer to the value thus  Here the approach to an equality among all the lines and columns is still more visible and the deviations restricted within narrower limits the terms in the oblique ascending lines still on one side of the value and gradually increasing while the columns and the oblique descending lines for the most part have their terms alternately too great and too little as is evident from their alternately becoming greater and less than each other and from an inspection of the whole it is easy to pronounce that the first three figures of the number sought will be Taking therefore the last sour terms of the first descending line and proceeding as before we have  And finally taking the lowest ascending line because it has most the appearance of being alternately too great and too little proceed with it as before thus  where the numbers in the lines and columns gradually approach nearer together till the last mean is true to the nearest unit in the last figure giving us for the value of the proposed hypergeometrical series + + + c  And in like manner are we to proceed with any other series whose terms have alternate signs  Royal Military Acad Woolwich  May  POSTSCRIPT  SINCE the foregoing method was discovered and made known to several friends two passages have been offered to my consideration which I shall here mention in justice to their authors Sir Isaac New∣ton and the late learned Mr Euler  The first of these is in Sir Isaac's letter to Mr Oldenburg dated  October  and may be seen in Collins's  Commercium Epistolicum  p the last paragraph near the bottom of the page namely  Per  seriem Leibnitii etiam  si ultimo loco dimidium termini adjiciatur  alia quaedam similia artificia adhibeantur potest computum produci ad multas figuras  The series here alluded to is ⅓ + ⅕ + + c denoting the area of the circle whose diameter is and Sir Isaac here directs to add in half the last term after having collected all the foregoing as the means of obtaining the sum a little exacter And this indeed is equivalent to taking one arithmetical mean between two successive sums but it does not reach the idea contained in my method It appears also both by the other words  alia quaedam similia artificia adhibeantur  contained in the above extract and by these  alias artes adhibuissem  a little higher up in the same page that Sir Isaac Newton had several other contrivances for obtaining the sums of slowly converging series but what they were it may perhaps be now impossi∣ble to determine  The other is a passage in the  Novi Comment Petropol  tom v p where Mr Euler gives an instance of taking one set of arithmetical means between a series of quantities which are gradually too little and too great to obtain a nearer value of the sum of a series in question But neither does this reach the idea contained in my method How∣ever I have thought it but justice to the characters of these two eminent men to make this mention of their ideas which have some relation to my own though unknown to me at the time of my discovery  TRACT III  A Method of summing the Series a  +  bx  +  cx    +  dx    +  ex    +  c when it converges very slowly namely when x is nearly equal to    and the Coefficients a b c d c decrease very slowly the Signs of all the Terms being positive  Art WHEN we have occasion to find the sum of such series as that abovementioned having the coefficients  a b c d  c of the terms decreasing very slowly and the con∣verging quantity  x  pretty large we can neither find the sum by col∣lecting the terms together on account of the immense number of them which it would be necessary to collect neither can it be summed by means of the differential series because the powers of the quantity  x    x  will then diverge faster than the differential coefficients converge In such case then we must have recourse to some other method of trans∣forming it into another series which shall converge faster The follow∣ing is a method by which the proposed series is changed into another which converges so much the quicker as the original series is slower  The method is thus Assume  a    D the given series  a  +  bx  +  cx    +  dx    + c Then shall  which by actual division is  Consequently  a    divided by this series will be equal to the series proposed and this new series will be very easily summed in com∣parison with the original one because all the coefficients after the second term are evidently very small and indeed they are so much the smaller and fitter for summation by how much the coefficients of the  original series are nearer to equality so that when these  a b c d  c are quite equal then the third fourth c coefficients of the new series become equal to nothing and the sum accurately equal to  which we also know to be true from other principles  Although the first two terms  a    bx  of the new series be very great in comparison with each of the following terms yet these latter may not always be small enough to be entirely rejected where much accuracy is required in the summation And in such case it will be necessary to collect a great number of them to obtain their sum pretty near the truth because their rate of converging is but small it being indeed pretty much like to the rate of the original series but only the terms each to each are much smaller and that commonly in a degree to the hundredth or thousandth part  The resemblance of this new series however beginning with the third term to the original one in the law of progression intimates to us that it will be best to sum it in the very same manner as the former Hence then putting  a′  =  c    b      a  b′  =  d    bc    a  +  b      a    c′  =  e    bd  +  c      a  +  b    c    a      b      a    c  and consequently the proposed series  a  +  bx  +  cx    + c =  by taking the sum of the series  a′  +  b′ x  +  c′ x    + c by the very  same theorem as before the sum S of the original series will then be expressed thus  where the series in the last denominator having again the same pro∣perties with the former one will have its first two terms very large in respect of the following terms But these first two terms  a′    b′x  are themselves very small in comparison with the first two  a    bx  of the former series and therefore much more are the third fourth c terms of this last denominator very small in comparison with the same  a    bx  for which reason they may now perhaps be small enough to be neglected  But if these last terms be still thought too large to be omitted then find the sum of them by the very same theorem and thus proceed by repeating the operation in the same manner till the required degree of accuracy is obtained Which it is evident will happen after a small number of repetitions because that in each new denominator the third fourth c terms are commonly depressed in the scale of num∣bers two or three places lower than the first and second terms are And the general theorem denoting the sum S when the process is con∣tinually repeated will be this    But the general denominator D in the fraction  a    D which is as∣sumed for the value of S or  a  +  bx  +  cx    + c may be otherwise found as below from which the general law of the values of the coefficients will be rendered visible Assume S or  a  +  bx  +  cx    + c or  then shall  Hence by equating the coefficients of the like terms to nothing we obtain the following general values  a′  =  c    bb    a  c  Where the values of the coefficients are the same in effect as before found but here the law of their continuation is manifest  To exemplify now the use of this method let it be proposed to sum the very slow series  x  + ½  x    + ⅓  x    + ¼  x    + ⅕  x    + ⅙  x    + c when  x  = = which denotes the hyperbolic log of  x  or in this case of  Now it will be proper in the first place to collect a few of the first terms together and then apply the theorem to the remaining terms which by being nearer to an equality than the terms are near the be∣ginning of the series will be fitter to receive the application of the theorem Thus to collect the first terms  No  Powers of  x  The first terms found by dividing  x x    x      c by the numbers c                                                                              the sum of terms  Then we have to find the sum of the rest of the terms after these first namely of  x    × +  x  +  x    +  x    + c in which  x  = and  x    = also  a  =  b  =  c  = c and the first application of our rule gives for the value of +  x  +  x    + c or S  the second gives  the third gives  the fourth gives  Or when the terms in the numerators are squared it is  Or by omitting a proper number of ciphers it is  I have written an unknown quantity  z  after the last denominator to represent the small quantity to be subtracted from the last denominator Now rejecting the small quantity  z  and beginning at the last fraction to calculate their values will be as here ranged in the first an∣nexed column  placing  z  below them for the next unknown fraction Divide then every fraction by the next below it placing the quotients or ratios in the next column Then take the quotients or ratios of these and so on till the last ratio  which from the nature of the series of the first terms of every column must be less than the next preceding one consequently  z  must be less than × or less than But from the nature of the series in the vertical row or column of first ratios  z  must be less than and consequently  z  must be greater than or greater than Since then  z  is less than and greater than it is probable that the mean value is near the truth and accordingly taking for  z  or rather as  z  appears to be nearer than and taking the continual ratios as placed along the last line of the table their values are found to accord very well with the next preceding numbers both in the columns and oblique rows  Hence using for  z  in the denominator  z  of the last

commonly to be found with much ease and expedition by means of logarithms when the indices of such roots are simple numbers and the roots are not required to a great number of figures And the square or cubic roots of numbers to a good practical degree of accuracy may be ob∣tained almost by inspection by means of my tables of squares and cubes published by order of the Commissioners of Longitude in the year But when the indices of such roots are certain complex or irrational numbers or when the roots are required to be found to a great many places of figures it is necessary to make use of certain ap∣proximating rules by means of the ordinary arithmetical computa∣tions Such rules as are here alluded to have only been discovered since the great improvements in the modern algebra and the persons who have best succeeded in their enquiries after such rules have been successively Sir Isaac Newton Mr Raphson M de Lagney and Dr Halley who have shewn that the investigation of such theorems is also useful in discovering rules for approximating to the roots of all sorts of affected algebraical equations to which the former rules for the roots of all simple equations bear a considerable affinity It is presumed that the following short tract contains some advantages over any other method that has hitherto been given both as to the ease and universality of the conclusions and the general way in which the investigations are made for here a theorem is discovered which although it be general for all roots whatever is at the same time very accurate and so simple and  easy to use and to keep in mind that nothing more so can be desired or hoped for and farther that instead of searching out rules severally for each root one after another our investigation is at once for any indefinite possible root by whatever quantity the index is expressed whether fractional or irrational or simple or compound  In every theorem or rule here investigated let  N be the given number whose root is sought  n  the index of that root  a  its nearest rational root or  a  n    the nearest rational power to N whe∣ther greater or less  x  the remaining part of the root sought which may be either positive or negative namely positive when N is greater than  a  n    otherwise negative  Hence then the given number N is  and the required root  =  a  +  x  Now for the first rule expand the quantity  by the binomial theorem so shall we have  Subtract  a  n  from both sides so shall  Divide by  so shall  or  Here on account of the smallness of the quantity  x  in respect of  a  all the terms of this series after the first term will be very small and may therefore be neglected without much error which gives us  for a near value of  x  being only a small matter too great And consequently  is nearly = N      n  the root sought And this may be accounted the first theorem  Again let the equation  be multi∣tiplied by  n  and  a  n  added to each side so shall we have  for a divisor Also multiply the sides of the same equation by  a  and subtract  a  n  + from each so shall we have  for a dividend Divide now this dividend by the divisor so shall  Which will be nearly equal to  x  for the same reason as before and this ex∣pression is nearly as much too little as the former expression was too great Consequently by adding  a  we have  a  +  x  or N      n  nearly  for a second theorem and which is nearly as much in defect as the for∣mer was in excess  Now because the two foregoing theorems differ from the truth by nearly equal small quantities if we add together the two numerators and the two denominators of the foregoing two fractional expressions namely  and  the sums will be the numerator and denominator of a new fraction which will be much nearer than either of the former The fraction so found is  which will be very nearly equal to N      n  or  a  +  x  the root sought for by division it is found to be equal to  a  +  x  *  n  ·  n  + ·  x      a    + c where the term is wanting which contains the square of  x  and the following terms are very small And this is the third theorem  A fourth theorem might be found by taking the arithmetical mean  between the first and second which would be  which will be nearly of the same value though not so simple as the third theorem for this arithmetical mean is found equal to  a  +  x  * +  n  ·  n  ·  x      a    + c  But the third theorem may be investigated in a more general way thus Assume a quantity of this form  with coefficients  p  and  q  to be determined from the process the other letters N  a n  repre∣senting the same things as before then divide the numerator by the denominator and make the quotient equal to  a  +  x  so shall the comparison of the coefficients determine the relation between  p  and  q  required Thus  then dividing the former of these by the latter we have  or  Then by equating the corresponding terms we obtain these three equations  =  a  p    q    p  +  q n  =  n    qn    p  +  q  =  From which we find  p    q    p  +  q  =  n  and  p ∶ q ∷ n  + ∶  n  So that by substituting  n  + and  n  or any quantities proportional to them for  p  and  q  we shall have  for the va∣lue of the assumed quantity  which is supposed nearly equal to  a  +  x  the required root of the quantity N  Now this third theorem  which is ge∣neral for roots whatever be the value of  n  and whether  a  n  be greater or less than N includes all the rational formulas of De Lagney and Halley which were separately investigated by them and yet this ge∣neral formula is perfectly simple and easy to apply and easier kept in mind than any one of the said particular formulas For in words at length it is simply this to  n  + times N add  n  times  a  n    and to  n  times N add  n  + times  a  n    then the former sum multi∣plied by  a  and divided by the latter sum will give the root N      n  nearly or as the latter sum is to the former sum so is  a  the assumed root to the required root nearly Where it is to be observed that  a  n  may be taken either greater or less than N and that the nearer it is to it the better  By substituting for  n  in the general theorem severally the num∣bers c we shall obtain the following particular theorems as adapted for the d d th th c roots namely for the  d or square root  d or cube root  th root  th root  th root  th root  To exemplify now our formula let it be first required to extract the square root of Here N =  n  = the nearest square is whose root is  Hence N +  a    = × + = and N +  a    = + × = then as ∶ ∷ ∶ × = = c  Again to approach still nearer substitute this last found root × for  a  the values of the other letters remaining as before we have  a    =    ×        =        then  N +  a    = × +        =  N +  a    = + ×        =  hence ∶ ∷ × or ∶ ×× = the root of very exact which being brought into decimals would be true to about places of figures  For a second example let it be proposed to double the cube or to find the cube root of the number  Here N =  n  = the nearest root  a  = also  a    = Hence N +  a    = + = and N +  a    = + = then as ∶ ∷ ∶ = = the first approximation Again take  a  = and consequently  a    = Hence N +  a    = + = and N +  a    = + = then as or as ∶ ∷ ∶ × = = for the cube root of which is true in the last figure  And by taking for the value of  a  and repeating the process a great many more figures may be found  For a third example let it be required to find the th root of  Here N =  n  = the nearest root  a  =  Hence N +  a    = + = and N +  a    = + = then as ∶ ∷ ∶ = for the first approximation  Again taking  a  = we have N +  a    = + = N +  a    = + = then as ∶ ∷ ∶ × = × = = c for the th root of and is true in the last figure  To find the th root of ⅓  Here N = ⅕  n  = the nearest root  a  = also  a    =  Hence N +  a    = ⅘ + = ⅘ = and N +  a    = ⅗ + = ⅗ = then as ∶ ∷ ∶ = for the root very exact by one operation being true to the nearest unit in the last figure  To find the th root of or the amount of pound for day at per cent per annum compound interest  Here N =  n  =  a  = the nearest root Hence N +  a  = and N +  a  = then as ∶ ∷ ∶ = = the root sought very exact at one operation  Let it be required to find the value of the quantity  or    Now this may be done two ways either by finding the ⅔ power or root of at once or else by finding the d or cubic root of and then squaring the result  By the first wayHere it is easy to see that  a  is nearly = because    = √ = + some small fraction Hence to find nearly the square root of or √ the nearest power to which is =  a    in this case Hence N +  a    = × + = and N +  a    = + × = then as or as ∶ ∷ ∶ × = = √ nearly  Then having N =  n  =  a  = and  a    = nearly it will be N + ½  a    = × + ½ × = and ½ N +  a    = ½ × + × = hence as ∶ ∷ ∶ = = for the value of the quantity sought nearly by this way  Again by the other method in finding first the value of  or the cube root of It is evident that is the nearest integer root being the cube root of =  a      Hence N +  a    = + = and N +  a    = + = then as ∶ ∷ ∶ or = nearly Then taking for  a  we have N +  a    = + = and N +  a    = + =  hence as or as  nearly Consequently the square of this or  will be =        ×        = = = the quantity sought more nearly being true in the last figure  TRACT V  A new Method of finding in finite and general Terms near Values of the Roots of Equations of this Form  namely having the Terms alternately Plus and Minus  THE following is one method more to be added to the many we are already possessed of for determining the roots of the higher equations By means of it we readily find a root which is sometimes accurate and when not so it is at least near the truth and that by an easy finite formula which is general for all equations of the above form and of the same dimension provided that root be a real one This is of use for depressing the equation down to lower dimen∣sions and thence for finding all the roots one after another when the formula gives the root sufficiently exact and when not it serves as a ready means of obtaining a near value of a root by which to com∣mence an approximation still nearer by the previously known methods of Newton or Halley or others This method is farther useful in elucidating the nature of equations and certain properties of numbers as will appear in some of the following articles We have already easy methods for finding the roots of simple and quadratic equations I shall therefore begin with the cubic equation and treat of each order of equations separately in ascending gradually to the higher dimensions  Let then the cubic equation  x      px    +  qx    r  = o be pro∣posed Assume the root  x  =  a  either accurately or approximately as it may happen so that  x    a  = o accurately or nearly Raise this  x    a  = o to the third power the same dimension with the proposed equation so shall  x      a x    +  a    x    a    = o but the proposed equation is  x      p x    +  q x    r  = o therefore the one of these is equal to the other But the first term  x    of each is the same and hence if we assume the second terms equal between themselves it will follow that the sum of the two remain∣ing terms will also be equal and give a simple equation by which the value of  x  is determined Thus  a x    being =  px    or  a  = ⅓  p  we shall have  a    x    a    =  qx    r  and hence  by substituting ⅓  p  the value of  a  instead of it  Now this value of  x  here found will be the middle root of the proposed cubic equation For because  a  is assumed nearly or accu∣rately equal to  x  and also equal to ⅓  p  therefore  x  is = ⅓  p  nearly or accurately that is ⅓ of the sum of the three roots to which the coefficient  p  of the second term of the equation is always equal and thus being a medium among the three roots it will be either nearly or accurately equal to the middle root of the proposed equation when that root is a real one  Now this value of  x  will always be the middle root  accurately  whenever the three roots are in arithmetical progression otherwise only  approximately  For when the three roots are in arithmetical progres∣sion ⅓  p  or ⅓ of their sum it is well known is equal to the middle term or root In the other cases therefore the abovefound value of  x  is only  near  the middle root  When the roots are in arithmetical progression because the middle term or root is then = ⅓  p  and also  therefore  or  an equa∣tion  expressing the general relation of  p q  and  r  where  p  is the sum of any three terms in arithmetical progression  q  the sum of their three rectangles and  r  the product of all the three For in any equation the coefficient  p  of the second term is the sum of the roots the coefficient  q  of the third term is the sum of the rectangles of the roots and the coefficient  r  of the fourth term is the sum of the solids of the roots which in the case of the cubic equation is only oneThus if the roots or arithmetical terms be Here  p  = + + =  q  = × + × + × = + + =  r  = × × = then  p    = ×    = and  also  To illustrate now the rule  by some examples let us in the first place take the equation  x      x    +  x  = Here  p  =  q  = and  r  = consequently  This being substituted for  x  in the given equation makes all the terms to vanish and therefore it is an exact root and the roots will be in arithmetical progression Dividing therefore the given equation by  x  = the quotient is  x      x  + = the roots of which quadratic equation are and the other two roots of the proposed equation  x      x    +  x  =  If the equation be  x      x    +  x  = we shall have  p  =  q  = and  r  = then  Then substituting for  x  in the proposed equation the negative terms are sound to exceed the positive terms by thereby shewing that is very near but something above the middle root and that there∣fore the roots are not in arithmetical progression It is therefore pro∣bable  that may be the true value of the root and on trial it is found to succeed  Then dividing  x      x    +  x  by  x  the quotient is  x  •    x  + = the roots of which quadratic equation are and the two other roots of the proposed equation  If the equation be  x      x    +  x  = we shall have  p  =  q  = and  r  = then  This value of  x  being substituted for it in the proposed equation causes all the terms to vanish as it ought thereby shewing that is the middle root and that the roots are in arithmetical progression  Accordingly dividing the given quantity  x      x    +  x  by  x  the quotient is  x  •    x  + = a quadratic equation whose roots are + √ and √ the two other roots of the equation proposed  If the equation be  x      x    +  x  = we shall have  p  =  q  = and  r  = then  From which one might guess the root ought to be and which being tried is found to succeed  But without such trial we may make use of this value or  nearly and approximate with it in the common way  Having found the middle root to be divide the given quantity  x      x    +  x  by  x  and the quotient is  x      x  + = the roots of which are + √ and √ the two other roots as in the last article  If the equation be  x      x    +  x  = we shall have  p  =  q  = and  r  = then  or nearly Then trying for  x  it is found to succeed And dividing  x      x    +  x  by  x  the quotient is  x  •    x  + = a quadratic equation whose roots are + √ and √ the two other roots of the proposed equation which are both impossible or imaginary  If the equation be  x      x    +  x  = we shall have  p  =  q  = and  r  = then  Which being substi∣tuted for  x  it is found to answer the sum of the terms coming out = Therefore the roots are in arithmetical progression And ac∣cordingly by dividing  x      x    +  x  by  x  the quotient is  x      x  + = the roots of which quadratic equation are + √ and √ the two other roots of the proposed equation and the common difference of the three roots is √  But if the equation be  x      x    +  x  = we shall have  p  =  q  = and  r  = then  Which being substituted for  x  in the proposed equation the sum of the terms differs very widely from the truth thereby shewing that the middle root of the equation is an imaginary one as it is indeed the three roots being and + √ and √  In Art the value of  x  was determined by assuming the second terms of the two equations equal to each other But a like near value might be determined by assuming either the two third terms or the two sourth terms equal  Thus the equations being  x      ax    +  a    x    a    =  x      px    +  qx    r  =  if we assume the third terms  a    x  and  qx  equal or  a  = √⅓  q  the sums of the second and fourth terms will be equal namely  ax    +  a    =  px    +  r  and hence we find  by substituting √⅓  q  the value of  a  instead of it  And if we assume the fourth terms equal namely  a    =  r  or √  r  then the sums of the second and third terms will be equal namely  ax    a    =  px    q  and hence  by substitu∣ting  r  ⅓ instead of  a  And either of these two formulas will give nearly the same value of the root as the first formula at least when the roots do not differ very greatly from one another  But if they differ very much among themselves the first formula will not be so accurate as these two others because that in them the roots were more complexly mixed together for the second formula is drawn from the coefficient of the third term which is the sum of all the rec∣tangles of the roots and the third formula is drawn from the coefficient of the last term which is equal to the continual product of all the roots while the first formula is drawn from the coefficient of the second term which is simply the sum of the roots And indeed the last theorem is commonly the nearest of all So that when we suspect the roots to be very wide of each other let either the second or third be used  Thus in the equation  x      x    +  x  = whose three roots are and Here  p  =  q  =  r  = and by  the st theor  nearly  d theor  nearly  d theor  nearly  Where the two latter are much nearer the middle root than the first  And the mean between these two is which is very near to that root And this is commonly the case the one being nearly as much too great as the other is too little  To proceed now in like manner to the biquadratic equation which is of this general form  x      px    +  qx      rx  +  s  =  Assume the root  x  =  a  or  x    a  = and raise this equation  x    a  = to the fourth power or the same height with the proposed equation which will give  x      ax    +  a    x      a    x  +  a    = but the proposed equation is  x      px    +  qx      rx  +  s  = therefore these two are equal to each other Now if we assume the second terms equal namely  a  =  p  or  a  = ¼  p  then the sums of the three remaining terms will also be equal namely  and hence  or  by substituting ¼  p  instead of  a  then resolving this quadratic equation we find its roots to be thus  or if we put A =  p      q  B =  p      r  C =  p      s  the two roots will be    It is evident that the same property is to be understood here as for the cubic equation in Art namely that the two roots above found are the middle roots of the four which belong to the biquadratic equation when those roots are real ones for otherwise the formulae are  of no use But however those roots will not be accurate when the sum of the two middle roots of the proposed equation is equal to the sum of the greatest and least roots or when the four roots are in arithmetical progression because that in this case ¼  p  the assumed value of  a  is neither of the middle roots exactly but only a mean between them  To exemplify this formula  let the propo∣sed equation be  x      x    +  x      x  + = Then A =  p      q  =    × × = = B =  p      r  =    × = = C =  p      s  =    × = = Hence  nearly or ¼ and ¾ nearly or nearly and whose sum is And trying and they are both found to answer and there∣fore they are the two middle roots  Then  by which dividing the given equation  x      x    +  x      x  + = the quotient is  x      x  + = the roots of which quadratic equation are and and which therefore are the greatest and least roots of the equation proposed  If the equation be  x      x    +  x      x  + = then A =  p      q  =    × × = = B =  p      r  =    × = = C =  p      s  =    × = = Hence  and or and nearly both of which answer on trial and therefore and are the two middle roots  Then  by which dividing the given quantity  x      x    +  x      x  + = the quotient is  x      x  + = the roots of which quadratic equation are and which therefore are the greatest and least roots of the equation proposed  If the equation be  x      x    +  x      x  + = we have A =  p      q  =    × × = ½ = ½ B =  p      r  =    × = = C =  p      s  =    × = = Hence  or nearly and both which are found on trial to answer and therefore and are the two middle roots sought  Then  by which dividing the given equation  x      x    +  x      x  + = the quotient is  x      x  + = the roots of which quadratic equation are + √ and √ and which therefore are the greatest and least roots of the proposed equation  But if the equation be  x      x    +  x      x  + = we have  A =  p      q  =    × × = ½ = ½  B =  p      r  =    × = =  C =  p      s  =    × = =  Hence  an imaginary quantity shewing that the two middle roots are imaginary and therefore the formula is of no use in this case the four roots being + √ √ and  And thus in other examples the two middle roots will be found when they are rational or a near value when irrational which in this  case will serve for the foundation of a nearer approximation to be made in the usual way  We might also find another formula for the biquadratic equation by assuming the last terms as equal to each other for then the sum of the d d and th terms of each would be equal and would form another quadratic equation whose roots would be nearly the two mid∣dle roots of the biquadratic proposed  Or a root of the biquadratic equation may easily be found by assuming it equal to the product of two squares as  For comparing the terms of this with the terms of the equation pro∣posed in this manner namely making the second terms equal then the third terms equal and lastly the sums of the fourth and fifth terms equal these equations will determine a near value of  x  by a simple equation For those equations are      Then the values of  ab  and  a  +  b  found from the first and second of these equations and substituted in the third this gives  a general formula for one of the roots of the biquadratic equation  x      px    +  qx      rx  +  s  =  To exemplify now this sormula let us take the same equation as in Art namely  x      x    +  x      x  + = the roots of which were there found to be and Then by our last for∣mula we shall have  or nearly which is the least root  Again in the equation  x      x    +  x    x    + = whose roots are + √ and √ we have  nearly which is nearly a mean between the two least roots and √ or ⅗ nearly  But if the equation be  x      x    +  x      x  + = which has impossible roots the four roots being + √ √ and we shall have  nearly which is of no use in this case of imaginary roots  This formula will also sometimes fail when the roots are all real As if the equation be  x      x    +  x      x  + = the roots of which are and For here  which is of no use  For equations of higher dimensions as the th the th the th c we might in imitation of this last method combine other forms of quantities together Thus for the th power we might compare it either with  or with  or with  or with  And so for the other powers  TRACT VI  Of the Binomial Theorem With a Demonstration of the Truth of it in the General Case of Fractional Exponents  IT is well known that this famous theorem is called  binomial  because it contains a proposition of a quantity consisting of  two  terms as a radix to be expanded in a series of equal value It is also called emphatically the Newtonian theorem or Newton's binomial theorem because he has commonly been reputed the author of it as he was indeed for the case of fractional exponents which is the most general of all and includes all the other particular cases of powers or divisions c  The binomial as proposed in its general form was by Newton thus expressed  where P is the first term of the binomial Q the quotient of the second term divided by the first and conse∣quently PQ is the second term itself or PQ may represent all the terms of a multinomial after the first term and consequently Q the quotient of all those terms except the first term divided by that first term and may be either positive or negative also  m    n  represents the exponent of the binomial and may denote any quantity integral or fractional positive or negative rational or surd When the exponent  is integral the denominator  n  is equal to and the quantity then in this form  denotes a binomial to be raised to some power the series for which was fully determined before Newton's time as I have shewn in the historical introduction to my Mathematical Tables lately published When the exponent is fractional  m  and  n  may be any quantities whatever  m  denoting the index of some power to which the binomial is to be raised and  n  the index of the root to be extracted of that power and to this case it was first extended and applied by Newton When the exponent is negative the reciprocal of the same quantity is meant as  is equal to    Now when the radical binomial is expanded in an equivalent series it is asserted that it will be in this general form namely  where the law of the progression is visible and the quantities P  m n  Q include their signs + or the terms of the series being all positive when Q is positive and alternately positive and negative when Q is negative independent however of the effect of the coefficients made up of  m  and  n  also A B C D c in the latter form denote each pre∣ceding term This latter form is the easier in practice when we want  to collect the sum of the terms of a series but the former is the fitter for shewing the law of the progression of the terms  The truth of this series was not demonstrated by Newton but only inferred by way of induction Since his time however several attempts have been made to demonstrate it with various success and in various ways of which however those are justly preferred which proceed by pure algebra and without the help of fluxions And such has been esteemed the difficulty of proving the general case independent of the doctrine of fluxions that many eminent mathematicians to this day account the demonstration not fully accomplished and still a thing greatly to be desired Such a demonstration I think I have effected But before I deliver it it may not be improper to premise somewhat of the history of this theorem its rise progress extension and demon∣strations  Till very lately the prevailing opinion has been that the theorem was not only invented by Newton but first of all by him that is in that state of perfection in which the terms of the series for any assigned power whatever can be found independently of the terms of the pre∣ceding powers namely the second term from the first the third term from the second the fourth term from the third and so on by a gene∣ral rule Upon this point I have already given an opinion in the history to my logarithms above cited and I shall here enlarge some∣what farther on the same head  That Newton invented it himself I make no doubt But that he was not the first inventor is at least as certain It was described by Briggs in his Trigonometria Britannica long before Newton was born not indeed for fractional exponents for that was the application of Newton but for any integral power whatever and that by the general law of the terms as laid down by Newton independent of the terms of the powers preceding that which is required For as to the generation of the coefficients of the terms of one power from those of  the preceding powers successively one after another it was remarked by Vieta Oughtred and many others and was not unknown to much more early writers on arithmetic and algebra as will be manifest by a slight inspection of their works as well as the gradual advance the pro∣perty made both in extent and perspicuity under the hands of the successive masters in arithmetic every one adding somewhat more towards the perfection of it  Now the knowledge of this property of the coefficients of the terms in the powers of a binomial is at least as old as the practice of the ex∣traction of roots for this property was both the foundation the prin∣ciple and the means of those extractions And as the writers on arith∣metic became acquainted with the nature of the coefficients in powers still higher just so much higher did they extend the extraction of roots still making use of this property At first it seems they were only ac∣quainted with the nature of the square which consists of these three terms and accordingly extracted the square roots of numbers by means of them but went no farther The nature of the cube next presented itself which consists of these four terms and by means of these they extracted the cubic roots of numbers in the same manner as we do at present And this was the extent of their extrac∣tions in the time of Lucas de Burgo an Italian who from to wrote several tracts on arithmetic containing the sum of what was then known of this science which chiefly consisted in the doctrine of the proportions of numbers the nature of figurate numbers and the extraction of roots as far as the cubic root inclusively  It was not long however before the nature of the coefficients of all the higher powers became known and tables formed for constructing them indefinitely For in the year came out at Norimberg an excellent treatise of arithmetic and algebra by Michael Stifelius a Ger∣man divine and an honest but a weak disciple of Luther In this work  Arithmetica Integra  of Stifelius are contained several curious  things some of which have been ascribed to a much later date He here treats pretty fully and ably of progressional and figurate numbers and in particular of the following table for constructing both them and the coefficients of the terms of all powers of a binomial which has been so often used since his time for these and other purposes and which more than a century after was by Pascal otherwise called the arithme∣tical triangle and who only mentioned some additional properties of the table                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Stifelius here observes that the horizontal lines of this table furnish the coefficients of the terms of the correspondent powers of a binomial and teaches how to use them in extracting the roots of all powers what∣ever And after him the same table was used for the same purpose by Cardan and Stevin and the other writers on arithmetic I suspect however that the nature of this table was known much earlier than the time of Stifelius at least so far as regards the progressions of figurate numbers a doctrine amply treated of by Nicomachus who lived according to some before Euclid but not till long after him according to others and whose work on arithmetic was published at Paris in and which it is supposed was chiefly copied in the treatise on the same subject by Boethius but I have never seen either  of these two works Though indeed Cardan seems to ascribe the in∣vention of the table to Stifelius but I suppose that is only to be understood of its application to the extraction of roots See Cardan's  Opus Novum de Proportionibus  where he quotes it and extracts the table and its use from Stifelius's book Cardan also at page  et seq  of the same work makes use of a like table to find the number of va∣riations of things or conjugations as he calls them  The contemplation of this table has probably been attended with the invention and extension of some of our most curious discoveries in mathematics both in regard to the powers of a binomial with the consequent extraction of roots the doctrine of angular sections by Vieta and the differential method by Briggs and others For one or two of the powers or sections being once known the table would be of excel∣lent use in discovering and constructing the rest And accordingly we find this table used on many occasions by Stifelius Cardan Stevin Vieta Briggs Oughtred Mercator Pascal c c  On this occasion I cannot help mentioning the ample manner in which I see Stifelius at fol  et seq  of the same book treats of the nature and use of logarithms though not under the same name but under the idea of a series of arithmeticals adapted to a series of geo∣metricals He there explains all their uses such as that the addition of them answers to the multiplication of their geometricals subtraction to division multiplication of exponents to involution and dividing of exponents to evolution And he exemplifies the use of them in cases of the RuleofThree and in finding mean proportionals between given terms and such like exactly as is done in logarithms So that he seems to have been in the full possession of the idea of logarithms and wanted only the necessity of troublesome calculations to induce him to make a table of such numbers  But although the nature and construction of this table namely of figurate numbers was thus early known and employed in the raising of powers and extracting of roots yet it was only by raising the num∣bers one from another by continual additions and then taking them from the table for use when wanted till Briggs first pointed out the way of raising any horizontal line in the foregoing table by itself with∣out any of the preceding lines and thus teaching to raise the terms of any power of a binomial independent of any other powers and so gave the substance of the binomial series in words wanting only the notation in symbols as I have shewn at large at page of the historical intro∣duction to my Mathematical Tables  Whatever was known however of this matter related only to pure or integral powers no one before Newton having thought of extracting roots by infinite series He happily discovered that by considering powers and roots in a continued series roots being as powers having fractional exponents the same binomial series would equally serve for them all whether the index should be fractional or integral or the series be finite or infinite  The truth of this method however was long known only by trial in particular cases and by induction from analogy Nor does it appear that even Newton himself ever attempted any direct proof of it But various demonstrations of this theorem have been since given by the more modern mathematicians of which some are by means of the doc∣trine of fluxions and others more legally from the pure principles of algebra only Some of which I shall here give a short account of  One of the first was Mr James Bernoulli His demonstration is among several other curious things contained in his little work called  Ars Conjectandi  which has been improperly omitted in the collection of his works published by his nephew Nicholas Bernoulli This is a strict  demonstration of the binomial theorem in the case of integral and affirmative powers and is to this effect Supposing the theorem to be true in any one power as for instance in the cube it must be true in the next higher power which he demonstrates But it is true in the cube in the fourth fifth sixth and seventh powers as will easily appear by trial that is by actually raising those powers by continual multipli∣cations Therefore it is true in all higher powers All this he shews in a regular and legitimate manner from the principles of multipli∣cation and without the help of fluxions But he could not extend his proof to the other cases of the binomial theorem in which the powers are fractional And this demonstration has been copied by Mr John Stewart in his commentary on Sir Isaac Newton's quadrature of curves To which he has added from the principles of fluxions a demonstra∣tion of the other case for roots or fractional exponents  In No of the Philosophical Transactions for the year is given a theorem by Mr De Moivre in imitation of the bi∣nomial theorem which is extended to any number of terms and thence called the multinomial theorem which is a general expression in a series for raising any multinomial quantity to any power His de∣monstration of the truth of this theorem is independent of the truth of the binomial theorem and contains in it a demonstration of the binomial theorem as a subordinate proposition or particular case of the other more general theorem And this demonstration may be con∣sidered as a legitimate one for pure powers founded on the principles of multiplication that is on the doctrine of combinations and permu∣tations And it proves that the law of the continuation of the terms must be the same in the terms not computed or not set down as in those that are written down  The ingenious Mr Landen has given an investigation of the binomial theorem in his  Discourse concerning the Residual Analysis  printed in and in the  Residual Analysis  itself printed in  The investigation is deduced from this lemma namely if  m  and  n  be any integers and  q  =  v    x  then is  which theorem is made the principal basis of his Residual Analysis  The investigation is this the binomial proposed being  as∣sume it equal to the following series +  ax  +  bx    +  cx    c with indeterminate coefficients Then for the same reason as  will  Then by subtraction  And dividing both sides by  x    y  and by the lemma we have  Then as this equation must hold true whatever be the value of  y  take  y  =  x  and it will become  Consequently multiplying by +  x  we have  or its equal by the assumption viz  Then by comparing the homologous terms the value of the coefficients  a b c  c are deduced for as many terms as you compare  And a large account is given of this investigation by the learned Dr Hales in his  Analysis Equationum  lately published at Dublin  Mr Landen then contrasts this investigation with that by the method of fluxions which is as follows Assume as before  Take the fluxion of each side and we have  Divide by  ẋ  or take it = so shall  Then multiply by +  x  and so on as above in the other way  Besides the above which are the principal demonstrations and investigations that have been given of this important theorem I have been shewn an ingenious attempt of Mr Baron Maseres to demon∣strate this theorem in the case of roots or fractional exponents by the help of De Moivre's multinomial theorem But not being quite satis∣fied with his own demonstration as not expressing the law of continua∣tion of the terms which are not actually set down he was pleased to urge me to attempt a more complete and satisfactory demonstration of the general case of roots or fractional exponents And he farther proposed it in this form namely that if Q be the coefficient of one of the terms of the series which is equal to  and P the coefficient of the next preceding term and R the coefficient of the next follow∣lowing term then if Q be  to prove that R will be  This he observed would be quite perfect and satisfactory  as it would include all the terms of the series as well those that are omitted as those that are actually set down And I was in my de∣monstration to suppose if I pleased the truth of the binomial and mul∣tinomial theorems for integral powers as truths that had been previ∣ously and perfectly proved  In consequence I sent him soon after the substance of the following demonstration with which he was quite satisfied and which I now proceed to explain at large  Now the binomial integral is  where  a b c  c denote the whole coefficients of the d d th c terms over which they are placed and in which the law is this namely if P Q R be the coefficients of any three terms in succession and if  g    b  P = Q then is  as is evident and which it is granted has been proved  And the binomial fractional is  in which the law is this namely if P Q R be the coefficients of three terms in succession and if  g    b  P = Q then is  Which is the property to be proved  Again the multinomial integral is  c Or if we put  a b c d  c for the coefficients of the d d th th c terms the last series by substitution will be transformed into this form  Now to find the series in Art assume the proposed binomial equal to a series with indeterminate coefficients as  Then raise each side to the  n  power so shall  But it is granted that the multinomial raised to any integral power is proved and known to be as in the last Art  It follows then that if this last series be equal to +  x  by equating the homologous coefficients all the terms after the second must vanish or all the coefficients  b c d  c after the second term must be each = Writing therefore in this series for each of the letters  b c d  c it will become of this more simple form  Put now each of the coefficients after the second term = and we shall have these equations  c  The resolution of which equations gives the following values of the assumed indeterminate coefficients namely  c which coefficients are according to the law proposed namely when  g    h  P = Q then  g    n    h  +  n  Q = R  Q E D  Also by equating the second coefficients namely =  a  =  n  A we find A =  n  This being written for A in the above values of B C D c will give the proper series for the binomial in question namely    Of the  FORM  of the  ASSUMED SERIES  In the demonstrations or investigations of the truth of the binomial theorem the but or object has always been the law of the coefficients of the terms the form of the series as to the powers of  x  having never been disputed but taken for granted either as incapable of receiving a demonstration or as too evident to need one But since the demonstration of the law of the coefficients has been accomplished in which the main if not the only difficulty was supposed to consist we have extended our researches still farther and have even doubted or queried the very  form  of the terms themselves namely + A  x  + B  x    + C  x    + D  x    + c increasing by the regular in∣tegral series of the powers of  x  as assumed to denote the quantity  or the  n  root of +  x  And in consequence of these scruples I have been required by a learned friend to vindicate the  propriety of that assumption Which I think is effectually done as follows  To prove then that any root of the binomial +  x can  be re∣presented by a series of this form +  x  +  x    +  x    +  x    c where the coefficients are omitted our attention being now employed only on the powers of  x  let the series representing the value of  be + A + B + C + D + c where A B C c now represent the whole of the d d th c terms both their coef∣ficients and the powers of  x  whatever they may be only increasing from the less to the greater because they increase in the terms +  x  of the given binomial itself and in which the first term must evidently be the same as in the given binomial  Raise now  and its equivalent series + A + B + C + c both to the  n  power by the multinomial theorem and we shall have as before  Then equate the corresponding terms and we have the first term =  Again the second term of the series  n  A must be equal to the second term  x  of the binomial For none of the other terms of the series are equipollent or contain the same power of  x  with the term  n  A Not any of the terms A    A    A    c for they are double triple quadru∣ple c in power to A Nor yet any of the terms containing B C D c because by the supposition they contain all different and  increasing powers It follows therefore that  n  A makes up the whole value of the second term  x  of the given binomial Consequently the second term A of the assumed series contains only the first power of  x  and the whole value of that term A is =  nx  But all the other equipollent terms of the expanded series must be equal to nothing which is the general value of the terms after the second of the given quantity +  x  or +  x  + + + + c Our business is therefore to find the several orders of equipollent terms of the expanded series And these I say will be as I have arranged them above in which B is equipollent with A    C with A    D with A    and so on  Now that B is equipollent with A    is thus proved The value of the third term is But  is a part of the third term And it is only a part of that term otherwise  would be = which it is evident cannot happen in every value of  n  as it ought for in∣deed it happens only when  n  is = Some other quantity then must be equipollent with  n  ·  n  A    and must be joined with it to make up the whole third term equal to Now that supplemental quantity can be no other than  n  B for all the other following terms are evi∣dently plupollent than B It follows therefore that B is equipol∣lent with A    and contains the second power of  x  or that  and consequently    Again the fourth term must be = But the quantities  n  ·  n  ·  n  A    +  n  ·  n  AB are equipollent and make up part of that fourth term They are equipollent or A    equipollent with AB because A    and B are equipollent And they do not  constitute the whole of that term for if they did then would  n  ·  n  ·  n  A    +  n  ·  n  AB be = in all values of  n  or  n  A    + B = but it has been just shewn above that  n  A    + B = it would therefore follow that  n  would be =  n  a circumstance which can only happen where  n  = instead of taking place for every value of  n  Some other quantity must therefore be joined with these to make up the whole of the fourth term And this supplemental quantity can be no other than  n  c because all the other following quantities are evidently plupollent than A    or AB It follows therefore that C is equipollent with A    and therefore contains the d power of  x  And the whole value of C is    And the process is the same for all the other following terms Thus then we have proved the law of the whole series both with respect to the coefficients of its terms and to the powers of the letter  x  TRACT VII  Of the Common Sections of the Sphere and Cone Together with the Demonstration of some other New Properties of the Sphere which are similar to certain Known Properties of the Circle  THE study of the mathematical sciences is useful and profitable not only on account of the benefit derivable from them to the affairs of mankind in general but are most eminently so for the plea∣sure and delight the human mind feels in the discovery and contempla∣tion of the endless number of truths that are continually presenting themselves to our view These meditations are of a sublimity far above all others whether they be purely intellectual or whether they respect the nature and properties of material objects they methodise strengthen and extend the reasoning faculties in the most eminent de∣gree and so fit the mind the better for understanding and improving every other science but above all they furnish us with the purest and most permanent delight from the contemplation of truths peculiarly certain and immutable and from the beautiful analogy which reigns through all the objects of similar inquiry In the mathematical sciences the discovery often accidental of a plain and simple property is but the harbinger of a thousand others of the most sublime and beautiful nature to which we are gradually led delighted from the more simple to the more compound and general till the mind becomes quite en∣raptured at the full blaze of light bursting upon it from all directions  Of these very pleasing subjects the striking analogy that prevails among the properties of geometrical figures or figured extension is not one of the least Here we often find that a plain and obvious property of one of the simplest figures leads us to and forms only a particular case of a property in some other figure less simple afterwards this again turns out to be no more than a particular case of another still more general and so on till at last we often trace the tendency to end in a general property of all figures whatever  The few properties which make a part of this paper constitute a small specimen of the analogy and even identity of some of the more remarkable properties of the circle with those of the sphere To which are added some properties of the lines of section and of contact be∣tween the sphere and cone Both which may be farther extended as occasions may offer like as all of these properties have occurred from the circumstance mentioned near the end of the paper of considering the inner surface of a hollow spherical vessel as viewed by an eye or as illuminated by rays from a given point  PROPOSITION I  All the tangents are equal which are drawn from a given point with∣out a sphere to the surface of the sphere quite around  DEMONS For let PT be any tangent from the given point P and draw PC to the center C and join TC Also let CTA be a great circle of the sphere in the plane of the triangle TPC Then CP and CT as well as the angle T which is right Eucl iii being constant in every position of the tangent or of the point of contact T the square of PT will be every where equal to the difference of the squares of the constant lines CP CT and therefore constant and consequently the line or tangent PT itself of a constant length in every position quite round the surface of the sphere  diagram  PROP II  If a tangent be drawn to a sphere and a radius be drawn from the center to the point of contact it will be perpendicular to the tangent and a perpendicular to the tangent will pass through the center  DEMONS For let PT be the tangent TC the radius and CTA a great circle of the sphere in the plane of the triangle TPC as in the foregoing proposition Then PT touching the circle in the point T the radius TC is perpendicular to the tangent PT by Eucl iii  PROP III  If any line or chord be drawn in a sphere its extremes terminating in the circumference then a perpendicular drawn to it from the center will bisect it and if the line drawn from the center bisect it it is per∣pendicular to it  DEMONS For a plane may pass through the given line and the cen∣ter of the sphere and the section of that plane with the sphere will be a great circle Theodos i of which the given line will be a chord Therefore Eucl iii the perpendicular bisects the chord and the bisecting line is perpendicular  COROL A line drawn from the center of the sphere to the center of any lesser circle or circular section is perpendicular to the plane of that circle For by the proposition it is perpendicular to all the dia∣meters of that circle  PROP IV  If from a given point a right line be drawn in any position through a sphere cutting its surface always in two points the rectangle con∣tained under the whole line and the external part that is the rectangle contained by the two distances between the given point and the two points where the line meets the surface of the sphere will always be of  the same constant magnitude namely equal to the square of the tangent drawn from the same given point  DEMONS Let P be the given point and AB the two points in which the line PAB meets the surface of the sphere through PAB and the center let a plane cut the sphere in the great circle TAB to which draw the tangent PT Then the rectangle PAPB is equal to the square of PT Eucl iii but PT and consequently its square is con∣stant by Prop therefore the rectangle PAPB which is always equal to this square is every where of the same constant magnitude  diagram  PROP V  If any two lines intersect each other within a sphere and be termi∣nated at the surface on both sides the rectangle of the parts of the one line will be equal to the rectangle of the parts of the other And universally the rectangles of the two parts of all lines passing through the point of intersection are all of the same magnitude  DEMONS Through any one of the lines as AB conceive a plane to be drawn through the center C of the sphere cutting the sphere in the great circle ABD and draw its diameter DCPF through the point of intersection P of all the lines Then the rectangle APPB is equal to the rectangle DPPF Eucl iii  diagram  Again through any other of the intersecting lines GH and the center conceive another plane to pass cutting the sphere in another great circle DGFH Then because the points C and P are in this latter plane the line CP and consequently the whole diameter DCPF is in the same plane and therefore it is a diameter of the circle DGFH of which GPH is a chord Therefore again the rectangle GPPH is equal to the rectangle DPPF Eucl iii  Consequently all the rectangles APPB GPPH c are equal being each equal to the constant rectangle DPPF  COROL The great circles passing through all the lines or chords which intersect in the point P will all intersect in the common dia∣meter DPF  PROP VI  If a sphere be placed within a cone so as to touch it in two points then shall the outside of the sphere and the inside of the cone mutually touch quite around and the line of contact will be a circle  DEMONS Let V be the vertex of the cone C the center of the sphere T one of the two points of contact and TV a side of the cone Draw CT CV Then TVC is a triangle rightangled at T Prop In like manner t being another point of contact and Ct being drawn the triangle tVC will be rightangled at t These two triangles then TVC tVC having the two sides CT TV equal to the two Ct tV Prop and the included angle T equal to the included angle t will be equal in all respects Eucl i and consequently have the angle TVC equal to the angle tVC  diagram  Again let fall the perpendiculars TP tP Then the two triangles TVP tVP having the two angles TVP and TPV equal to the two tVP and tPV and the side TV equal to the side tV Prop will be equal in all respects Eucl i consequently TP is equal to tP and VP equal to VP Hence PT Pt are radii of a little circle of the sphere whose plane is perpendicular to the line CV and its cir∣cumference every where equidistant from the point C or V This circle is therefore a circular section both of the sphere and of the cone and is therefore the line of their mutual contact Also CV is the axis of the cone  COROL The axis of a cone when produced passes through the center of the inscribed sphere  COROL Hence also every cone circumscribing a sphere so that their surfaces touch quite around is a right cone nor can any scalene or oblique cone touch a sphere in that manner  PROP VII  The two common sections of the surfaces of a sphere and a right cone are the circumferences of circles if the axis of the cone pass through the center of the sphere  DEMONS Let V be the vertex of the cone C the center of the sphere and S one point of the less or nearer section draw the lines CS CV Then in the triangle CSV the two sides CS CV and the in∣cluded angle SCV are constant for all positions of the side VS and therefore the side VS is of a constant length for all positions and is consequently the side of a right cone having a circular base therefore the locus of all the points S is the circumference of a circle perpendicular to the axis CV that is the common section of the surfaces of the sphere and cone is that circumference  diagram  In the same manner it is proved that if A be any point in the farther or greater section and CA be drawn then VA is constant for all po∣sitions and therefore as before is the side of a cone cut off by a circu∣lar section whose plane is perpendicular to the axis  And these circles being both perpendicular to the axis are parallel to each other Or they are parallel because they are both circular sec∣tions of the cone  COROL Hence SA = sa because VA = Va and VS = Vs  COROL All the intercepted equal parts SA sa c are equally distant from the center For all the sides of the triangle SCA  are constant and therefore the perpendicular CP is constant also And thus all the equal right lines or chords in a sphere are equally distant from the center  COROL The sections are not circles and therefore not in planes if the axis pass not through the center For then some of the points of section are farther from the vertex than others  PROP VIII  Of the two common sections of a sphere and an oblique cone if the one be a circle the other will be a circle also  DEMONS Let SAas and ASVa be sections of the sphere and cone made by a common plane pass∣ing through the axes of the cone and the sphere also Ss Aa the diameters of the two sections Now by the supposition one of these as Aa is the diameter of a circle But the angle VSs = the angle VaA Eucl i and iii therefore Ss cuts the cone in subcontrary position to Aa and consequently if a plane pass through Ss and perpendicular to the plane AVa its section with the oblique cone will be a circle whose diameter is the line Ss Apol i But the section of the same plane and the sphere is also a circle whose diameter is the same line Ss Theod i Consequently the circum∣ference of the same circle whose diameter is Ss is in the surface both of the cone and sphere and therefore that circle is the common sec∣tion of the cone and sphere  diagram  In like manner if the one section be a circle whose diameter is Sa the other section will be a circle whose diameter is sA  COROL Hence if the one section be not a circle neither of them is a circle and consequently they are not in planes for the section of a sphere by a plane is a circle  COROL When the sections of a sphere and oblique cone are circles the axis of the cone does not pass through the center of the  sphere except when one of the sections is a great circle or passes through the center For the axis passes through the center of the base but not perpendicularly whereas a line drawn from the center of the sphere to the center of the base is perpendicular to the base by Cor to Prop  COROL Hence if the inside of a bowl which is a hemisphere or any segment of the sphere be viewed by an eye not situated in the axis produced which is perpendicular to the section or brim the lower or extreme part of the internal surface which is visible will be bounded by a circle of the sphere and the part of the surface seen by the eye will be included between the said circle and the border or brim which it intersects in two points For the eye is in the place of the vertex of the cone and the rays from the eye to the brim of the bowl and thence continued from the nearer part of the brim to the opposite in∣ternal surface form the sides of the cone which by the proposition will form a circular arc on the said internal surface because the brim which is the one section is a circle  And hence the place of the eye being given the quantity of inter∣nal surface that can be seen may be easily determined For the dis∣tance and height of the eye with respect to the brim will give the greatest distance of the section below the brim together with its magni∣tude and inclination to the plane of the brim which being known common menfuration furnishes us with the measure of the surface in∣cluded between them Thus if AB be the diameter in the vertical plane passing through the eye at E also AFB the sec∣tion of the bowl by the same plane and AIB the supplement of that arc Draw EAF EIB cutting this vertical circle in F and I and join IF Then shall IF be the diameter of the section or extremity of the visible surface and BF its greatest distance below the brim an arc which measures an angle double the angle at A  diagram  COROL Hence also and from Proposition it follows that if through every point in the circumference of a circle lines be drawn to a given point E out of the plane of the circle so that the rectangle con∣tained under the parts between the point E and the circle and between the same point E and some other point F may always be of a certain given magnitude then the locus of all the points F will also be a circle cutting the former circle in the two points where the lines drawn from the given point E to the several points in the circumference of the first circle change from the convex to the concave side of the circumfer∣ence And the constant quantity to which the rectangle of the parts is always equal is equal to the square of the line drawn from the given point E to either of the said two points of intersection  And thus the loci of the extremes of all such lines are circles  PROP IX  Prob  To place a given sphere and a given oblique cone in such positions that their mutual sections shall be circles  Let V be the vertex VB the least side and VD the greatest side of the cone In the plane of the triangle VBD it is evident will be found the center of the sphere Parallel to BD draw Aa the diameter of a circular section of the cone so that it be not greater than the diameter of the sphere Bisect Aa with the perpendicular EC with the center A and ra∣dius of the sphere cut EC in C which will be the center of the sphere from which therefore describe a great circle of it cutting the sides of the cone in the points S s A a so shall Ss and Aa be the diameters of circular sections which are common to both the sphere and cone  diagram  NOTE The substance of the above propositions was drawn up seve∣ral years ago And Mr Bonnycastle and Mr George Sanderson have this day shewn me the solution of a question in the London Magazine for April in which a similar section of a sphere with a cone is proved to be a circle and which I had never seen before Nor do I know of any other writings on the same subject  July    TRACT VIII  Of the Geometrical Division of Circles and Ellipses into any Number of Parts and in any proposed Ratios  ART IN the year was published a pamphlet in octavo with this title  A Dissertation on the Geometrical Analysis of the Antients With a Collection of Theorems and Problems without Solu∣tions for the Exercise of Young Students  This pamphlet was anony∣mous it was however well known to myself and several other persons that the author of it was the late Mr John Lawson B D rector of Swanscombe in Kent an ingenious and learned geometrician and what is still more estimable a most worthy and good man one in whose heart was found no guile and whose pure integrity joined to the most amiable simplicity of manners and sweetness of temper gained him the affection and respect of all who had the happiness to be acquainted with him His collection of problems in that pamphlet concluded with this singular one "To divide a circle into any number of parts which shall be as well equal in area as in circumferenceN B  This may seem a paradox however it may be effected in a manner strictly geo∣metrical  " The solution of this seeming paradox he reserved to him∣self as far as I know I fell upon the discovery however soon after and other persons might do the same My resolution of it was pub∣lished in an account which I gave of the pamphlet in the Critical Review for vol xl and which the author informed me was on  the same principle as his own This account is in page of that volume and in the following words  "We have no doubt but that our mathematical readers will agree with us in allowing the truth of the author's remark concerning the seeming paradox of this problem because there is no geometrical method of dividing the circumference of a circle into any proposed number of parts taken at pleasure and it does not readily appear that there can be any othermethod of resolving the problem than by draw∣ing radii to the points of equal division in the circumference However another method there is and that strictly geometrical which is as follows  "Divide the diameter AB of the given circle into as many equal parts as the circle itself is to be divided into at the points C D E c Then on the diameters AC AD AE c as also on BE BD BC c describe semicircles as in the annexed figure and they will divide the whole circle as required  diagram  "For the several diameters being in arithmetical progression of which the common difference is equal to the least of them and the dia∣meters of circles being as their circumferences these will also be in arithmetical progression But in such a progression the sum of the ex∣tremes is equal to the sum of each two terms equally distant from them therefore the sum of the circumferences on AC and CB is equal to the sum of those on AD and DB and of those on AE and EB c and each sum equal to the semicircumference of the given circle on the diameter AB Therefore all the parts have equal perimeters and each is equal to the circumference of the proposed circle Which satisfies one of the conditions in the problem  "Again the same diameters being as the numbers c and the areas of circles being as the squares of their diameters the semicircles will be as the numbers c and consequently the differences between all the adjacent semicircles are as the terms of the arithmetical progression c and here again the sums of the extremes and of every two equidistant means make up the seve∣ral equal parts of the circle Which is the other condition"  But this subject admits of a more geometrical form and is capa∣ble of being rendered very general and extensive and is moreover very fruitful in curious consequences For first in whatever ratio the whole diameter is divided whether into equal or unequal parts and whatever be the number of the parts the peri∣meters of the spaces will still be equal For since circumferences of circles are always as their diameters and because AB and AD + DB and AC + CB are all equal therefore the semicircum∣ferences c and b + d and a + e are all equal and constant whatever be the ratio of the parts AD DC CB of the diame∣ter We shall presently find too that the spaces TV RS and PQ will be universally as the same parts AD DC CB of the diameter  diagram  The semicircles having been described as before mentioned erect CE perpendicular to AB and join BE Then I say the circle on the diameter BE will be equal to the space PQ For join AE  Now the space P = semicircle on AB semicircle on AC but the semicir on AB = semicir on AE + semicir on BE and the semicir on AC = semicir on AE semicir on CE theref semic AB semic AC = semic BE + semicir CE that is the space P is = semic BE + semicir CE to each of these add the space Q or the semicircle on BC then P + Q = semic BE + semic CE + semic BC that is P + Q = double the semic BE or = the whole circle on BE  In like manner the two spaces PQ and RS together or the whole space PQRS is equal to the circle on the diameter BF And therefore the space RS alone is equal to the difference or the circle on BF  minus  the circle on BE  But circles being as the squares of their diameters BE    BF    and these again being as the parts or lines BC BD therefore the spaces PQ PQRS RS TV are respectively as the lines BC BD CD AD And if BC be equal to CD then will PQ be equal to RS as in the first or simplest case  Hence to find a circle equal to the space RS where the points D and C are taken at random From either end of the diameter as A take AG equal to DC erect GH perpendicular to AB and join AH then the circle on AH will be equal to the space RS For the space PQ the space RS ∷ BC ∶ CD or AG that is as BE    AH    the squares of the diameters or as the circle on BE to the cir∣cle on AH but the circle on BE is equal to the space PQ and therefore the circle on AH is equal to the space RS  Hence to divide a circle in this manner into any number of parts that shall be in any ratios to one another Divide the diameter  into as many parts at the points D C c and in the same ratios as those proposed then on the several distances of these points from the two ends A and B as diameters describe the alternate semicircles on the different sides of the whole diameter AB and they will divide the whole circle in the manner proposed That is the spaces TV RS PQ will be as the lines AD DC CB  But these properties are not confined to the circle alone but are to be found also in the ellipse as the genus of which the circle is only a species For if the annexed figure be an ellipse described on the axis AB the area of which is in like manner divided by similar semiellipses described on AD AC BC BD as axes all the semiperimeters f ae bd c will be equal to one another for the same reason as before in Art namely because the peripheries of ellipses are as their diameters And the same property would still hold good if AB were any other diameter of the ellipse instead of the axis describing upon the parts of it semiellipses which shall be similar to those into which the diameter AB divides the given ellipse  diagram  And if a circle be described about the ellipse on the diame∣ter AB and lines be drawn similar to those in the second figure then by a process the very same as in Art  et seq  substituting only semiellipse for semicircle it is found that the space  PQ is equal to the similar ellipse on the diameter BE  PQRS is equal to the similar ellipse on the diameter BF  RS is equal to the similar ellipse on the diameter AH  or to the difference of the ellipses on BF and BE also the elliptic spaces PQ PQRS RS TV are respectively as the lines BC BD DC AD  the same ratio as the circular spaces And hence an ellipse is divided into any number of parts in any assigned ratios in the same manner as the circle is divided namely dividing the axis or any diameter in the same manner and on the parts describing similar semi∣ellipses  TRACT IX  New Experiments in Artillery for determining the Force of fired Gun∣powder the Initial Velocity of Cannon Balls the Ranges of Pieces of Cannon at different Elevations the Resistance of the Air to Projectiles the Effect of different Lengths of Cannon and of different Quantities of Powder c c  Sect AT Woolwich in the year in conjunction with some able officers of the Royal Regiment of Artillery and other ingenious gentlemen I first instituted a course of experiments on fired gunpowder and cannon balls My account of them was presented to the Royal Society who honoured it with the gift of the annual gold medal and printed it in the Philosophical Transactions for the year The object of those experiments was the determination of the actual velocities with which balls are impelled from given pieces of cannon when fired with given charges of powder They were made according to the method invented by the very ingenious Mr Robins and de∣scribed in his treatise on the new principles of gunnery of which an account was printed in the Philosophical Transactions for the year Before the discoveries and inventions of that gentleman very little progress had been made in the true theory of military projectiles His book however contained such important discoveries that it was soon translated into several of the languages on the continent and the late samous Mr L Euler honoured it with a very learned and extensive commentary in his translation of it into the German language That  part of Mr Robins's book has always been much admired which re∣lates to the experimental method of ascertaining the actual velocities of shot and in imitation of which but on a large scale those experiments were made which were described in my paper Experiments in the manner of Mr Robins were generally repeated by his commentators and others with universal satisfaction the method being so just in theory so simple in practice and altogether so ingenious that it imme∣diately gave the fullest conviction of its excellence and the eminent abilities of the inventor The use which our author made of his inven∣tion was to obtain the real velocities of bullets experimentally that he might compare them with those which he had computed  a priori  from a new theory of gunnery which he had invented in order to verify the principles on which it was founded The success was fully answerable to his expectations and left no doubt of the truth of his theory at least when applied to such pieces and bullets as he had used These however were but small being only musket balls of about an ounce weight for on account of the great size of the machinery necessary for such experiments Mr Robins and other ingenious gentlemen have not ventured to ex∣tend their practice beyond bullets of that kind but contented them∣selves with ardently wishing for experiments to be made in a similar manner with balls of a larger sort By the experiments described in my paper therefore I endeavoured in some degree to supply that de∣fect having used cannon balls of above twenty times the size or from one pound to near three pounds weight Those are the only experi∣ments that I know of which have been made in that way with can∣non balls although the conclusions to be deduced from such a course are of the greatest importance in those parts of natural philosophy which are connected with the effects of fired gunpowder nor do I know of any other practical method besides that above of ascertaining the initial velocities of military projectiles within any tolerable degree of the truth except that of the recoil of the gun hung on an axis in the same manner as the pendulum which was also first pointed out and used by Mr Robins and which has lately been practised also by Benjamin  Thompson Esq in his very ingenious and accurate set of experiments with musket balls described in his paper in the Philosophical Trans∣actions for the year The knowledge of this velocity is of the greatest consequence in gunnery by means of it together with the law of the resistance of the medium every thing is determinable which re∣lates to that business for as I remarked in the paper abovementioned on my first experiments it gives us the law relative to the different quantities of powder to the different weights of balls and to the dif∣ferent lengths and sizes of guns and it is also an excellent method of trying the strength of different sorts of powder Beside these there does not seem to be any thing wanting to answer every inquiry that can be made concerning the flight and ranges of shot except the effects arising from the resistance of the medium  In that course of experiments were compared the effects of differ∣ent quantities of powder from two to eight ounces the effects of different weights of shot and the effects of different sizes of shot or different degrees of windage which is the difference between the dia∣meter of the shot and the diameter of the bore all of which were found to observe certain regular and constant laws as far as the experi∣ments were carried And at the end of each day's experiments the deductions and conclusions were made and the reasons clearly pointed out why some cases of velocity differ from others as they properly and regularly ought to do So that I am surprized how they could be mis∣understood by Mr Templehof captain in the Prussian artillery when speaking of the irregularities in such experiments he says page of  Le Bombardier Prussien  printed at Berlin "La meme chose arriva a Mr Hutton il la trouva de pieds le jour suivant de pieds  tout les circonstances étant d'ailleurs égales  " which last words shew that Mr T had either misunderstood or had not read the reason which is a very sufficient one for this remarkable difference it is expressly remarked in page of my paper in the Philosophical  Transactions that  all the circumstances  were  not  the same but that the one ball was much smaller than the other and that it had the less de∣gree of velocity feet because of the greater loss of the elastic fluid by the windage in the case of the smaller ball On the contrary the velocities in those experiments were even more uniform and similar thancould be expected in such large machinery and in a first attempt of the kind too And from the whole the following important con∣clusions were fairly drawn and stated viz  " And first it is made evident by these experiments that pow∣der fires almost instantaneously seeing that almost the whole of the charge fires though the time be much diminished  " The velocities communicated to shot of the same weight with different quantities of powder are nearly in the subduplicate ratio of those quantities A very small variation in defect taking place when the quantities of powder become great  " And when shot of different weights are fired with the same quantity of powder the velocities communicated to them are nearly in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of their weights  " So that universally shot which are of different weights and impelled by the firing of different quantities of powder acquire velo∣cities which are directly as the square roots of the quantities of powder and inversely as the square roots of the weights of the shot nearly  " It would therefore be a great improvement in artillery to make use of shot of a long form or of heavier matter for thus the mo∣mentum of a shot when fired with the same weight of powder would be increased in the ratio of the square root of the weight of the shot  " It would also be an improvement to diminish the windage for by so doing one third or more of the quantity of powder might be saved  " When the improvements mentioned in the last two articles are considered as both taking place it is evident that about half the quantity of powder might be saved which is a very considerable ob∣ject But important as this saving may be it seems to be still ex∣ceeded by that of the guns for thus a small gun may be made to have the effect and execution of one of two or three times its size in the present way by discharging a long shot of two or three times the weight of its natural ball or round shot and thus a small ship might discharge shot as heavy as those of the greatest now made use of  "Finally as the above experiments exhibit the regulations with re∣gard to the weight of powder and balls when fired from the same piece of ordnance so by making similar experiments with a gun varied in its length by cutting off from it a certain part before each course of experiments the effects and general rules for the different lengths of guns may be certainly determined by them In short the principles on which these experiments were made are so fruitful in consequences that in conjunction with the effects of the resistance of the medium they seem to be sufficient for answering all the inquiries of the speculative philosopher as well as those of the practical artillerist"  Such then was the state of the first set of experiments with cannon balls in the year and such were the probable advantages to be derived from them I do not however know that any use has hitherto been made of them by authority for the public service unless perhaps we are to except the instance of Carronades a species of ordnance which hath since been invented and in some degree adopted in the public  service for in this instance the proprietors of those pieces by availing themselves of the circumstances of large balls and very small windage with small charges of powder have been able to produce very consider∣able and useful effects with those light pieces at a very small expence Or perhaps those experiments were too much limited and of too pri∣vate a nature to merit a more general notice Be that however as it may the present additional course which is to make the subject of this tract will have very great advantages over the former both in point of extent variety improvements in machinery and in authority His Grace the Duke of Richmond the present mastergeneral of the ordnance in his indefatigable endeavours for the good of the public service was pleased to order this extensive course of experiments and to give directions for providing guns and machinery and every thing compleat and fitting for the proper execution of them  This course of experiments has been carried on under the direction of Major Blomefield inspector of artillery an officer of great profes∣sional merit and whose ingenious contrivances in the machinery do him great credit It has been our employment for three successive summers namely those of the years and and indeed it might be continued still much longer either by extending it to more objects or to more repetitions of experiments for the same object  The objects of this course have been various But the principal articles of it as follows  The velocities with which balls are projected by equal charges of powder from pieces of the same weight and calibre but of different lengths  The velocities with different charges of powder the weight and length of the gun being the same  The greatest velocity due to the different lengths of guns to be obtained by increasing the charge as far as the resistance of the piece is capable of sustaining  The effect of varying the weight of the piece every thing else being the same  The penetration of balls into blocks of wood  The ranges and times of flight of balls to compare them with their initial velocities for determining the resistance of the medium  The effect of wads of different degrees of ramming or compressing the charge of different degrees of windage of different positions of the vent of chambers and trunnions and every other circumstance necessary to be known for the improvement of artillery  Of the Nature of the Experiment and of the Machinery used in it  THE effects of most of the circumstances last mentioned are determined by the actual velocity with which the ball is projected from the mouth of the piece Therefore the primary object of the experi∣ments is to discover that velocity in all cases and especially in such as usually occur in the common practice of artillery This velocity is very great from one thousand to two thousand feet or more in a second of time For conveniently estimating so great a velocity the first thing necessary is to reduce it in some known proportion to a small one  Which we may conceive to be effected in this manner suppose the ball projected with a great velocity to strike some very heavy body such as a large block of wood from which it will not rebound so that after the stroke they may both proceed forward together with a common velocity By this means it is obvious that the original velocity of the ball may be reduced in any proportion or to any slow velocity which may con∣veniently be measured by making the body struck to be sufficiently large for it is well known that the common velocity with which the ball and the block of wood would move on together after the stroke bears to the original velocity of the ball before the stroke the same ratio which the weight of the ball has to that of the ball and block together Thus then velocities of one thousand feet in a second are easily reduced to those of two or three feet only which small velocity being measured by any convenient means let the number denoting it be increased in the ratio of the weight of the ball to the weight of the ball and block together and the original velocity of the ball itself will thereby be obtained  Now this reduced velocity is rendered easy to be measured by a very simple and curious contrivance of Mr Robins which is this the block of wood which is struck by the ball instead of being left at liberty to move straight forward in the direction of the motion of the ball is suspended like the weight of the vibrating pendulum of a clock by a strong iron stem having a horizontal axis at the top on the ends of which it vibrates freely when struck by the ball The con∣sequence of this simple contrivance is evident this large ballistic pen∣dulum after being struck by the ball will be penetrated by it to a small depth and it will then swing round its axis describing an arch which will be greater or less according to the force of the blow struck and from the magnitude of the arch described by the vibrating pendu∣lum the velocity of any point of the pendulum can be easily computed for a body acquires the same velocity by falling from the same height  whether it descend perpendicularly down or otherwise therefore ha∣ving given the length of the arc described by the center of oscillation and its radius the versed sine becomes known which is the height per∣pendicularly descended by that point of the pendulum The height de∣scended being thus known the velocity acquired in falling through that height becomes known also from the common rules for the descent of bodies by the force of gravity And the velocity of this center thus obtained is to be esteemed the velocity of the whole pendulum itself which being now given that of the ball before the stroke becomes known from the given weights of the ball and pendulum Thus then the determination of the very great velocity of the ball is reduced to the mensuration of the magnitude of the arch described by the pendu∣lum in consequence of the blow struck  Now this arch may be determined in various ways in the follow∣ing experiments it was ascertained by measuring the length of its chord which is the most useful line about it for making the calculation by and this chord was measured sometimes by means of a piece of tape or nar∣row ribbon the one end of which was fastened to the bottom of the pendulum and the rest of it made to slide through a small machine con∣trived for the purpose and sometimes it was measured by the trace of the fine point of a stylette in the bottom of the pendulum made in an arch concentric with the axis and covered with a composition of a pro∣per consistence which will be particularly described hereafter  Another similar method of measuring the great velocity of the ball is by observing the arch of recoil of the gun when it is hung also after the manner of a pendulum for by loading the gun with adventitious weight it may be made so heavy as to swing any convenient extent of arch we please which arch it is evident will be greater or less according to the velocity of the ball or force of the inslamed powder since action and reaction are equal and contrary that is the velocity of the ball will  be greater than the velocity of the center of oscillation of the gun in the same proportion as the weight of the gun exceeds the weight of the ball And therefore if the velocity of the center of oscillation of the gun be computed from the chord of the arc described by it in the recoil the velocity of the ball will be found by this proportion namely as the weight of the ball is to the weight of the gun so is the velocity of the gun to the velocity of the ball that is if the weight of powder had no effect on the recoil  This description may suffice to convey a general idea of the na∣ture and principles of the experiment for determining the velocity with which a ball is projected by any charge of powder from a piece of ord∣nance But it is to be observed that besides the center of oscillation and the weights of the ball and pendulum or gun the effect of the blow depends also on the place of the center of gravity in the pendulum or gun and that of the point struck or the place where the force is ex∣erted for it is evident that the arch of vibration will be greater or less according to the situation of these two points also It will therefore be necessary now to give a more particular description of the machinery and of the methods of finding the aforesaid requisites and then we shall investigate our general rules for determining the velocity of the ball in all cases from them and the chord of the arch of vibration either of the pendulum or gun  Of the Guns Powder Balls and Machinery employed in these Experiments  FIVE very fine brass onepounder guns were cast and pre∣pared in Woolwich Warren for these experiments and bored as true as possible the common diameter of their bore being inches and  parts of an inch These five guns are exactly represented in plate with the scale of their dimensions by which they were drawn Three of these namely n  o  are nearly of the same weight but of the respective lengths of and calibers in order to ascertain the effect of different lengths of bore with the same weight of gun powder and ball The other two n  o  and were heavier and of calibers in length to obtain the effects of the longest pieces N  o  was more expressly to shew the effect of different lengths of the same gun and for this purpose it was to be fired a sufficient number of rounds with its whole length and then to be successively diminished by sawing off it or inches at a time till it should be all cut away firing a num∣ber of rounds with it at each length And for the convenience of sus∣pending this gun near its center of gravity for all the different lengths of it a long thin slip was cast with it extending along the under side of it from the breech to almost the middle of its length By perforating this slip through with holes immediately under the center of gravity for each length after being cut a bolt was to pass through the hole on which the gun might be suspended The other guns were slung by their trunnions  The exact weight and dimensions of all these guns are exhibited in the following table     Length of the  Diameter at the  Diam of the bore  Weight  N  o  of the gun  Piece in  Bore in  breech  muzzle           calib  inch  calib  inch  inch  inch  inch  lb

recoil described by the gun vibrating on an axis certain leaden weights were cast to fit on very exactly about the trunnions of the gun to render it so heavy as that the arch of recoil might not be inconveniently great These consisted first of central pieces to fit the trunnions and then over them cylindrical rings of different sizes both turned to fit exactly the whole being held firmly together by iron bolts put into holes bored through all the pieces These were also of different sizes so as to bring all the guns exactly up to the same weight the whole weight of each toge∣ther with lb weight of iron about the stem and machine by which the gun was slung was lb with which weight most of the experi∣ments were made notice being always taken when any alteration was made in the weights as well as in the other circumstances The com∣mon weight of lb is made up of the different guns and leads and the common weight of iron as below  N  o    Guns  Leads  Iron  Total    +  +  =      +  +  =      +  +  =      +  +  =      +  +  =    These were the weights at first but soon after the braces or strengthen∣ing rods of the gun frame were made longer and thicker which added lb to their weights and then the whole weight of each was lb  In these experiments the velocity of the ball by which the force of the powder is determined was to be measured both by the ballistic pendulum into which the ball was fired and by the arch of recoil of the gun which was hung on an axis by an iron stem after the same  manner as the pendulum itself and the arcs vibrated in both cases mea∣sured in the same way Plates and contain general representa∣tions of the machinery of both namely a side view and a front view of each as they hung by their stem and axis on the wooden supports In plate fig is the sideview of the pendulum and fig the side∣view of the gun as slung in their frames And in plate fig and are the frontviews of the same  In fig of both plates A is the pendulous block of wood into which the balls are fired strongly bound with thick bars of iron and hung by a strong iron stem which is connected by an axis at top the whole being firmly braced together by crossing diagonal rods of iron The cylin∣drical ends of the axis both in the gun and pendulum were at first placed to turn upon smooth flat plateiron surfaces having perpendicular pins put in before and behind the sides of the axis to keep it in its place and prevent it from slipping backwards and forwards But this method being attended with too much friction the ends of the axis were sup∣ported and made to roll upon curved pieces having the convexity up∣wards and the pins before and behind the axis set so as not quite to touch it which left a small degree of play to the axis and made the fric∣tion less than before But still farther to diminish the friction the lower side of the ends of the axis was sharpened off a little something like the axis of a scale beam and made to turn in hollow grooves which were rounded down at both ends and standing higher in the middle like the curvature of a bent cylinder by which means the edge of the axis touched the grooves not in a line but in one point only when it vi∣brated with very great freedom having an almost imperceptible degree of friction The several times and occasions when these and other im∣provements were introduced and used will be more particularly noticed in the journal of the experiments  At first the chord of the arc of vibration and recoil was measured by means of a prepared narrow tape divided into inches and tenths as before A new contrivance of machinery was however made for it From the bottom of the pendulum or gunframe proceeded a tongue of iron which was raised or lowered by means of a screw at B this was cloven at the bottom C to receive the end of the tape and the lips then pinched together by a screw which held the tape fast Immediately below this the tape was passed between two slips of iron which could be brought to any degree of nearness by two screws these pieces were made to slide vertically up and down a groove in a heavy block of wood and fixed at any height by a screw D One of these latter pieces was extended out a considerable length to prevent the tape from getting over its ends and entangling in the returns of the vibrations The extent of tape drawn out in a vibration it is evident is the chord of the arc described and counted in inches and tenths to the radius measured from the middle of the axis to the bottom of the tongue  This method however was found to be attended with much trouble and many inconveniences as well as doubts and uncertainty sometimes For which reasons we afterwards changed this method of measuring the chord of vibration for another which answered much bet∣ter in every respect This consisted in a block of wood having its upper surface EF formed into a circular arc whose center was in the middle of the axis and consequently its radius equal to the length from the axis to the upper surface of the block In the middle of this arch was made a shallow groove of or inches broad running along the middle through the whole length of the arch This groove was filled with a composition of softsoap and wax of about the consistence of honey or a little firmer and its upper side smoothed off even with the general sur∣face of the broad arch A sharp spear or stylette then proceeded from the bottom of the pendulum or gunframe and so low as just to enter and scratch along the surface of the composition in the groove without  having any sensible effect in retarding the motion of the body The trace remaining the extent of it could easily be measured This measurement was effected in the following mannerA line of chords was laid down upon the upper surface of the wooden arch on each side of the groove and the divisions marked with lines on a ground of white paint the edge of a straight ruler being then laid across by the cor∣responding divisions just to touch the farthest extent of the trace in the composition gave the length of the chord as marked on the arch To make the computations by the rule for the velocity easier the divi∣sions on the chords were made exact thousandth parts of the radius which saved the trouble of dividing by the radius at every operation The manner in which I constructed this line of chords on the face of the arch was this The radius was made just feet I therefore pre∣pared a smooth and straight deal rod upon which I set off feet I then divided each foot into equal parts and each of these into parts again by which means the whole rod or radius was divided into equal parts being th parts of a foot I then transferred the divisions of the rod to the face of the arch in this manner namely the first divi∣sion of the rod was applied to the side of the arch at the beginning of it and made to turn round there as a center then in that position the rod when turned vertically round that point always touched the side of the arch and the divisions of it were marked on the edge of the arch successively as they came into a coincidence with it  In fig plate G shews the leaden weights placed about the trunnions H a screw for raising or depressing the breech of the gun by means of the piece embracing the cascable and moveable along the perpendicular arm KL to suit the different lengths of guns and held to it by a screw passing through the slit made along it  The machines and operations for finding the ranges will be described hereafter  Of the Centers of Gravity and Oscillation  It being necessary to know the position of the centers of gravity and oscillation without which the velocity cannot be computed these were commonly determined every day as follows  The center of gravity was found by one or both of these two methods First a triangular prism of iron AB being placed on the ground with one edge up∣wards the pendulum or gunframe was laid across it and moved backward or forward on the stem or block as the case required till the two parts exactly balanced each other in a horizontal position Then as it lay the distance was measured from the middle of the axis to the part which rested on the edge of the prism or the place of the center of gravity which is the distance  g  of that center below the axis  diagram  The other method is this The ends of the axis being supported on fixed uprights and a chord fastened to the lower end of the block or of the gun frame and passed over a pulley at P different weights  w  were fastened to the other end of it till the body was brought to a horizontal position Then taking also the whole weight of the body and its length from the axis to the bottom where the chord was fixed the place of the center of gravity is found by this proportion  As  p  the weight of the pendulum  is to  w  the appended weight ∷  so is  d  the whole length from the axis to the chord  to  dw p  the distance from the axis to the center of gravity  Either of these two methods gave the place of the center of gravity suf∣ficiently exact but the agreement of the results of both of them was still more satisfactory  To find the center of oscillation the ballistic pendulum or the gun was hung up by its axis in its place and then made to vibrate in small arcs for minute or or or minutes the more the better as determined either by a half second pendulum or a stop watch or a peculiar timepiece measuring the time to th parts of a second and the number of vibrations performed in that time carefully counted Having thus obtained the time answering to a certain number of vibra∣tions the center of oscillation is easily found for if  n  denote the number of vibrations made in  s  seconds and  l  the length of the second pendulum then it is well known that  n    ∶  s    ∷  l  ∶  s    l  n    the distance from the axis of motion to the center of oscillation And here if  s  be seconds or one minute and  n  the number of vibrations performed in minute as found by dividing the whole number of vibrations actually performed by the whole number of minutes then is  n    ∶    ∷  l  ∶  l    nn  the distance to the center of oscillation But by the best observations on the vibration of pendulums it is found that  l  = ⅛ inches is the length of the second pendulum for the latitude of London or of Woolwich and therefore  or  nn  = will be the distance in inches or =  nn  in feet of the center of oscillation below the axis And by this rule the place of that center was found for each day of the experiments  Of the Rule for Computing the Velocity of the Ball  Having described the methods of obtaining the necessary dimen∣sions and weights I proceed now to the investigation of the theorem by  which the velocity of the ball is to be computed and first by means of the pendulum  The several weights and measures being found let  b  denote the weight of the ball  p  the weight of the pendulum  g  the distance to its center of gravity  o  the distance to its center of oscillation  i  the distance to the point of impact or point struck  c  the chord of the arch described by the pendulum  r  its radius or distance to the tape or arch  v  the initial or original velocity of the ball  Then from the nature of oscillatory motion  bii  will express the sum of the forces of the ball acting at the distance  i  from the axis and  pgo  the sum of the forces of the pendulum and consequently  pgo  +  bii  the sum for both the ball and pendulum together and if each be multiplied by its velocity  biiv  will be the quantity of motion of the ball and  pgo  +  bii  ×  z  the quantity for the pendulum and ball together where  z  is the velocity of the point of impact But these quantities of motion before and after the blow must be equal to each other therefore  pgo  +  bii  ×  z  =  biiv  and consequently  z  =  biiv    pgo  +  bii  is the velocity of the point of impact Now because of the accession of the ball to the pendulum the place of the center of oscillation will be changed and the distance  y  of the new or compound center of oscillation will be found by dividing  pgo  +  bii  the sum of the forces by  pg  +  bi  the sum of the mo∣menta that is  y  =  pgo  +  bii    pg  +  bi  is the distance of the new or compound center of oscillation below the axis Then because  biiv    pgo  +  bii  is the velocity of the point whose distance is  i  by similar figures we shall have this propor∣tion as  i  ∶  pgo  +  bii    pg  +  bi  or  y  ∷  biiv    pgo  +  bii  ∶  biv    pg  +  bi  the velocity of this com∣pound center of oscillation  Again by the property of the circle  r  ∶  c  ∷  c  ∶  cc    r  which will be the versed sine of the described arc to the chord  c  and radius  r  and hence by similar figures  r y  or  pgo  +  bii    pg  +  bi  ∷  cc    r  ∶  cc    rr  ×  pgo  +  bii    pg  +  bi  the corresponding versed sine to the radius  y  or the versed sine of the arc described by the compound center of oscillation which call v Then because the velo∣city lost in ascending through the circular arc or gained in descending through the same is equal to the velocity acquired in descending freely by gravity through its versed sine or perpendicular height therefore the velocity of this center of oscillation will also be equal to the ve∣locity generated by gravity in descending through the space v or  cc    rr  ×  pgo  +  bii    pg  +  bi  But the space described by gravity in one second of time in the latitude of London is feet and the velocity ge∣nerated in that time therefore by the nature of free descents √ ∶ √  v  ∷ ∶  c    r  √  pgo  +  bii    pg  +  bi  the velocity of the same center of oscillation as deduced from the chord of the arc which is actually described  Having thus obtained two different expressions for the velocity of this center independent of each other let an equation be made of them and it will express the relation of the several quantities in the question thus then we have  biv    pg  +  bi  =  c    r  √  pgo  +  bii    pg  +  bi  And from this equation we get  the true expression for the original velocity of the ball the moment before it strikes the pendulum And this theorem agrees with those of Messrs Euler and Antoni and also with that of Mr Robins nearly for the same purpose when his rule is corrected by the paragraph which was by mistake omitted in his book when first published which correction he himself gave in a paper in the Philosophical Transactions for April and where he informs us that all the velocities of balls mentioned in his book except the first only  were computed by the corrected rule Though the editor of his works published in has inadvertently neglected this correction and printed his book without taking any notice of it And that remark had M Euler observed it might have saved him the trouble of many of his animadversions on Mr Robins's work  But this theorem may be reduced to a form much more simple and fit for use and yet be sufficiently near the truth Thus let the root of the compound factor  pgo  +  bii  ×  pg  +  bi  be extracted and it will be equal to  pg  +  bi  ·  o  +  i  × √ within the th part of the true value in such cases as commonly happen in practice But since  bi  ·  o  +  i  in our experiments is usually but about the th or th or th part of  pg  and since  bi  differs from  bi  ·  o  +  i  only by about the th part of itself therefore  pg  +  bi  is within the th part of  pg  +  bi  ·  o  +  i  Consequently  v  =  c  ·  pg  +  bi    bir  √  o  very nearly Or farther if  g  be written for  i  in the last term  bi  then finally  v  =  gc  ·  p  +  b    bir  √  o  which is an easy theorem to be used on all occasions and being within the th part of the true quantity it will always give the velocity true within less than half a foot even in the cases of the greatest velocity Where it must be observed that  c g i r  may be taken in any measures either feet or inches c provided they be but all of the same kind but  o  must be in feet because the theorem is adapted to feet  As the balls remain in the pendulum during the time of making one whole set of experiments both its weight and the position of the centers of gravity and oscillation will be changed by the addition of each ball which is lodged in the wood and therefore  p g o  must be corrected after every shot in the theorem for determining the velocity  v  Now  the succeeding value of  p  is always  p  +  b  or  p  is to be corrected by the continual addition of  b  and the succeeding value of  g  is  or  g  +  i    g    p b  nearly or  g  is corrected by adding always  i    g    p b  to the next preceding value of  g  and lastly  o  is to be corrected by taking for its new values successively  or by adding always  or  i    o    p b  nearly to the preceding value of  o  so that the three corrections are made by adding always  b  to the value of  p  i    g    p  ×  b  to the value of  g  i    o    p  ×  b  to the value of  o  That is when  b  is very small in respect of  p  But as the distance of the center of oscillation  o  whose square root is concerned in the theorem for the velocity  v  is found from the number of vibrations  n  performed by the pendulum it will be better to substitute in that theorem the value of  o  in terms of  n  Now by Art the value of  o  is  nn  feet and consequently √  o  =  n  which value of √  o  being substituted for it in the theorem  v  =  gc  ×  p  +  b    bir  √  o  it becomes  v  =  gc  ×  p  +  b    birn  or ×  p  +  b    birn gc  the simplest and easiest formula for the velocity of the ball in feet where  c g i r  may be taken in any one and the same measure either all inches or all feet or any other measure  It will be necessary here to add a correction for  n  instead of that for  o  in Art Now the correction for  o  being  and the  value of  n  = √  o  inches the correction for  n  will be  by substituting the value of  o  instead of it Which correction is negative or to be subtracted from the former value of  n  The corrections for  p  and  g  being  b  and  as in Art which are both additive But the signs of these quantities must be changed when  b  is negative  Before we quit this rule it may be necessary here to advert to three or four circumstances which may seem to cause some small error in the initial velocity as determined by the formula in Art These are the friction on the axis the resistance of the air to the back of the pendulum the time which the ball employs in penetrating the wood of the pendulum and the resistance of the air to the ball in its passage be∣tween the gun and the pendulum  As to the first of these namely the friction on the axis by which the extent of its vibration is somewhat diminished it may be observed that the effect of this cause can never amount to a quantity considerable enough to be brought into account in our experiments for besides that care was taken to render this friction as small as possible the effect of the small part which does remain is nearly balanced by the effect it has on the number  n  of vibrations performed in a minute for the friction on the axis will a little retard its motion and cause its vibrations to be slower and sewer so that  c  the length of a vibration and  n  the number of vibrations being both diminished by this cause nearly in an equal degree and  c  being a multiplier and  n  a divisor in our formula it is  evident that the effect of the friction in the one case operates against that in the other and that the difference of the two is the real dis∣turbing cause and which therefore is either equal to nothing or very nearly so  The second cause of error is the resistance of the air against the back of the pendulum by which its motion is somewhat impeded This resistance hinders the pendulum from vibrating so far and describing so large an arch as it would do if there was no such resistance therefore the chord of the arc which is actually described and measured is less than it really ought to be and consequently the velocity of the ball which is proportional to that chord will be less than the real velocity of the ball at the moment it strikes the pendulum And although the pen∣dulum be very heavy and its motion but slow and consequently the resistance of the air against it very small it will yet be proper to investi∣gate the real effect of it that we may be sure whether it may safely be neglected or not  In order to this let the annexed figure represent the back of the pendulum moving on its axis and put  p  = weight of the pendulum  a  = DE its breadth  r  = AB the distance to the bottom  e  = AC the distance to the top  x  = AF any variable distance  g  = distance of the center of gravity  o  = distance of the center of oscillation  v  = velocity of the center of oscillation in any part of the vibration  h  = feet the descent of gravity in second  c  = the chord of the arc actually described by the center of oscillation and c = the chord which would be described by it if the air had no resistance  diagram  Then  o ∶ x ∷ v  ∶  vx    o  the velocity of the point F of the pendulum and  h    ∶  h  ∷  v    x      o    ∶  v    x      ho    the height descended by gravity to generate the velocity  vx    o  Now the resistance of the air to the line DFE is equal to the pressure of a column of air upon it whose height is the same  v    x      ho    and therefore that pressure or weight is  nav    x      ho    where  n  is the specific gravity or weight of one cubic measure of air or  n  = ½ lb = lb Hence then  nav    x    x    ho    is the pressure on DEed and  nav    x    x    ho    the momentum of the pressure on the same De or the fluxion of the momentum on the block of the pendulum and the cor∣rect fluent gives  for the momentum of the air on the whole pendulum supposing that on the stem AC to be nothing as it is nearly both on account of its narrowness and the diminution of the mo∣mentum of the particles by their nearness to the axis Put now A = the compound coefficient  so shall A  v    denote the momen∣tum of the air on the back of the pendulum  But the motion of the pendulum is also obstructed by its own weight as well as by the resistance of the air and that weight acts as if it were all concentered in the center of gravity whose distance below the axis is  g  therefore  pg  is its momentum in its natural or vertical direction and  pgs  its momentum perpendicular to the motion of the pendulum when  s  is the sine of the angle which it makes at any time with the vertical position to the radius Hence  pgs  + A  v    is the momen∣tum of both the resistances together namely that of the pressure of the air and of the weight of the pendulum And consequently  pgs  +A  v      pg  =  s  + A  pg v    is the real retarding force to the motion of the pendulum at the center of oscillation which force call  f  Now if  z  denote the arc described by the center of oscillation when its velocity is  v  or  z    o  the arc whose fine is  s  we shall have  and by the doctrine of forces    But  cc    o  is the versed sine or height of the whole arc whose chord is  c  and  is the versed sine or height of the part whose sine is  os  therefore  is their difference or the height of the remaining part and is nearly equal to the height due to the velocity  v  therefore  nearly Then by substituting this for  v    in the value of  vv̇  we have  and the fluents give  where Q is a constant quantity by which the fluent is to be corrected Now substituting v    for  v    and o for  s  their corresponding values at the commencement of motion the above fluent becomes v    =  ho  + Q from which the former subtracted gives  And when  v  = o or the pendulum is at the full extent of its ascent then  at which point  os  is the sine of the whole arc whose chord is  c  and consequently    But the value of  s  being commonly small in respect of  c    o  we shall have these following values nearly true namely      z  =  os  + ⅙  os    and  o      c      o    z    os  =  c    s    o  +  o      c      o s    which values by substitution give  v    =  hc      o  +  h    o  A  pq    c    s    o    o      c      o s      But c      o  is the versed sine or height to the chord c and v    =  h  · c      o  =  h  c      o  the square of the velocity due to that height therefore  h  c      o  =  hc      o  +  h    o  A  pq    c    s    o    o      c      o s    and c    =  c    +  ho  A  pq    c    s    o      c      s    or c    =  c    +  h  A  pq    c    +  c  •    o    and c =  c  +  c    h  A  pq  nearly or substituting for A c =  c  +  nac      pg  ·  r      c      o    =  c  +  nac    pg  ·  r      e      o    So that the chord of the arc which is actually described is to that which would be described if the air had no resistance as is to +  nac    pg  ·  r      e      o    and therefore  nac    pg  ·  r      e      o    is the part of the chord and consequently of the velocity lost by means of the resistance of the air And the proportion is the same for the chords described by the lowest point or any other point of the pendulum  Now to give an example in numbers of this effect of the resistance of the air the ordinary mean values of the literal quantities are as here below  namely  therefore  p  =  nac  =  a  = z     r  = ½    pg  =  e  = ½  r    =  g  = ⅔  e    =  o  = ⅓  r      e    =  n  =  o    =  c  = ⅔  nac    pg  ·  r      e      o    =  So that the part of the chord or velocity lost by this cause namely the resistance of the air on the back of the pendulum is but about the or about the part of the whole and therefore this effect scarcely ever amounts to so much as half a foot Being indeed about ½ of a foot when the velocity of the ball is feet  ¼  when  it is    ⅜  when  it is    and so on in proportion to the whole velocity of the ball  And even this small effect may be supposed to be balanced by the method of determining the center of oscillation or the number of vibra∣tions made in a second So that the number of oscillations and the chord of the arc described being both diminished by the resistance of the air and the one of these quantities being a multiplier and the other a divisor in the formula for the velocity the one of those small effects will nearly balance the other much in the same way as the effects of the first cause or the friction on the axis So that these effects may both of them be safely neglected as in no case amounting to any sensible quantity  In the beginning of this investigation it is supposed that the resist∣ance of the medium is equal to the weight of a column of the medium whose base is the moving surface and its altitude equal to that from whence a heavy body must fall to acquire the velocity of that sur∣face But some philosophers think the altitude should be only one half of that and consequently the pressure only one half which would ren∣der the resistance still less considerable But if the altitude and resist∣ance were even double of that above found it might be still safely neglected  The third seeming cause of error in our rule is the time in which the ball communicates its motion to the pendulum or the time employed in the penetration The principle on which the rule is founded supposes the momentum of the ball to be communicated in an instant but this is not accurately the case because this force is com∣municated during the time in which the ball makes the penetration And although that time be evidently very small scarcely amounting to the th part of a second it will be proper to enquire what effect that circumstance may have on the truth of our theorem or on the velocity of the ball as computed by it  In order to this let the notation employed in Art be supposed here and let ABC be a sideview of the pendulum moved out of the vertical position AD by the perpendicular blow of the ball against the point D or C Also  let  x  = DC the space moved by the point of impact C  z  = CB the depth penetrated by the ball  v = velocity of the ball at B  u  = velocity of the point C of the pendulum and  R  = the uniform resisting force of the wood  diagram  Then is  R    b  the retarding force of the ball which is constant Again as the motion of the pendulum arises from the resisting force  R  of the  wood  Ri  will be its momentum and as the sum of the forces in the pendulum was found to be =  pgo  the accelerating force of the point c will be  Rii    pgo  which force is constant also But in the action of forces that are constant the time  t  is equal to the velocity divided by the force and by  h  or × feet and the space is equal to the square of the velocity divided by the force and by  h  consequently  t  =  pgou    hiiR x  =  pgouu    hiiR  and  t  =  b  v  hR x  +  z  =  b  vv  hR  or by correc  t  =  b    hR  ×  v  v  x  +  z  =  b    hR  ×  v    v    The two values of the time  t  being equated we obtain  pgou  =  bii    v  v or  pgou  +  bii  v =  biiv  And when v =  u  or the action of the ball on the pendulum ceases this equation becomes  pgo  U +  bii  U =  biiv  and hence u =  biiv    pgo  +  bii  is the greatest velocity of the point C at the instant when the ball has penetrated to the greatest depth and ceases to urge the pendulum farther So that this velocity is the same whatever the resisting force of the wood is and therefore to whatever depth the ball penetrates and the same as if the wood were perfectly hard or the ball made no penetration at all And this velocity of the point of impact also agrees with that which was found in Art So that the velocity communicated to the point of impact is the same whether the impulse is made in an instant or in some small portion of time And hence in the usual case of a penetration because the block will have moved some small distance before it has attained its greatest velocity it might at first view seem as if it would swing or rise higher than when that velocity is communicated in an instant or when the pendulum is yet in its ver∣tical position and so might describe a longer chord and shew a greater velocity of the ball than it ought But on the other hand it must be  considered that in the small part of its swing which the pendulum has made before the penetration is completed or has attained its greatest velocity just as much velocity will be lost by the opposing gravity or weight of the pendulum as if it had set out from the vertical position with the said greatest velocity and therefore the real velocity at that height will be the same in both cases Hence then it may safely be con∣cluded that the circumstance of the ball's penetration causes no altera∣tion in the velocity of it as computed by our formula And as it was before found that no sensible error is incurred by the two first circum∣stances namely the friction on the axis and the resistance of the air to the back of the pendulum we may be well assured that our formula brings out the true velocity with which the ball strikes the pendulum without any sensible error  Since  biiv    pgo  +  bii  denotes the greatest velocity which the point c of the pendulum acquires by the stroke dividing by  i  we shall have  biv    pgo  +  bii  for the angular velocity of the pendulum or that of a radius From which it appears that the vibration will be very small when  i  or the distance AD is small and also when  i  is very great And if we take this expression a  maximum  and make its fluxion =  i  only being variable we shall obtain  pgo  =  bii  and  i  = √  pgo    b  for the distance of the center of percussion or the point where the ball must strike so as to cause the greatest vibration in the pendulum which point in this case is neither the center of gravity nor the center of oscillation but will be at a great distance below the axis when  p  is great respect of  b  as in the case of our experiments in which  p  is or times  b  It may not be improper here by the way to enquire a little into the time of the penetration its extent or depth and the measure of the resisting force of the wood  It was found above that  x  =  pgouu    hiiR  and  x  +  z  =  b    hR  ×  v    v    Now substituting in these  biiv    pgo  +  bii  the greatest value of  u  for  u  and v we have    The latter of these being the greatest depth penetrated by the ball into the wood and the former the distance moved by the point C of the pen∣dulum at the instant when the penetration is completed Both of which it is evident are directly as the square of the original velocity of the ball and inversely as the resisting force of the wood the other quantities remaining constant  Hence also it appears that other things remaining the penetration will be less as  i  is greater or as the point of impact is farther below the axis It is farther evident that the penetration will diminish as the sum of the forces  pgo  diminishes  Now for an example in numbers a ball fired with a velocity of feet per second has been found to penetrate about inches into a block of sound dry elm when the dimensions of the pendulum were as below  p  = lb  the ball being cast iron  g  = inches or ½ feet  its diameter inches  o  = inches or feet  and its weight or lb  i  = inches or ½ feet  and the value of  z  is inch or feet  Here the value of  v  is and  z  = inches or feet  Hence  nearly which is the value of  R  for a ball of that size and weight Or the resistance in this instance is times the force of gravity Hence also  part of a foot or part of an inch is the space moved by the point C of the pendulum when the penetration is completed  Also  part of a second is the time of completing the penetration of inches deep  Upon the whole then it appears that our rule will give without sensible error the true velocity with which the ball strikes the pendulum But this is not however the same velocity with which the ball issues from the mouth of the gun which will indeed be something greater than the former on account of the resistance of the air which the ball passes through in its way from the gun to the pendulum And although this space of air be but small and although the elastic fluid of the pow∣der pursue and urge the ball for some distance without the mouth of the piece and so in some degree counteract the resistance of the air yet it will be proper to enquire into the effect of this resistance as it will pro∣bably cause a difference between the velocity of the ball as computed from the vibration of the pendulum and the vibration of the gun which difference will by the bye be no bad way of measuring the resistance of the air especially if the gun be placed at a good distance from the pendulum for the vibration of the gun will measure the velocity with which the ball issues from the mouth of it and the vibration of the pen∣dulum the velocity with which it is struck by the ball  To find therefore the resistance of the air against the ball in any case it is first to be considered that the resistance to a plane moving  perpendicularly through a fluid at rest is equal to the weight or pressure of a column of the fluid whose altitude is the height through which the body must fall by the force of gravity to acquire the velocity with which it moves through the fluid the base of the column being equal to the plane So that if  a  denote the area of the plane  v  the velocity  n  the specific gravity of the fluid and  h  = feet the altitude due to the velocity  v  being  vv    h  the whole resistance or motive force  m  will be  a  ×  n  ×  vv    h  =  anvv    h  Now if  d  denote the diameter of the ball and  k  = then shall  a  =  kd    be a great circle of the ball and consequently  the motive force on the surface of a circle equal to a great circle of the ball  But the resistance on the hemispherical surface of the ball is only one half of that on the flat circle of the same diameter therefore  is the motive force on the ball and if  w  denote its weight  will be equal to  f  the retarding force  Since ⅔  kd    is the magnitude of the sphere if N denote its density or specific gravity its weight  w  will be = ⅔  kd    N consequently the re∣tarding force  f  or  m w  will be    But by the laws of forces  vv̇  =  hfẋ  =  nvv    d  N  ẋ  and  v̇    w  =  n    d  N  ẋ  =  eẋ  where  x  is the space passed over putting  e  =  n    d  N and making the value negative because the velocity  v  is de∣creasing And the correct fluent of this is log v log  v  or log  v w  =  ex  where v is the first or greatest velocity of projection Or if A be = c the number whose hyperbolic logarithm is  then is v  v  = A  ex  and hence the velocity  v  = v A  ex  = VA  ex  So that the first velocity is to the last velocity as A  ex  to And the ve∣locity lost by the resistance of the medium is A  ex    v  or A  ex  A  ex  V  Now to adapt this to the case of our balls which weighed on a medium ¾ ounces when the diameter was inches we shall have    × = the magnitude of the ball and as cubic foot or cubic inches of water weighs ounces therefore  is the specific gravity of the iron ball which is very justly something less than the usual specific gravity of solid cast iron on account of the small air bubble which is in all cast metal balls Also the mean specific gravity of air is which is the value of  n  Hence    Now the common distance of the face of the pendulum from the trun∣nions of all the guns was ½ feet and the distance of the muzzles of the four guns was nearly ¼ for the st or shortest gun for the d for the d and ½ for the th But as the elastic fluid pursues and urges the ball for a few feet after it is out of the gun it may be sup∣posed to counterbalance the resistance of the air for a few feet the num∣ber of which cannot be certainly known and therefore we shall suppose feet to be the common distance for each of the guns which the ball passes through before it reach the pendulum Hence then the distance  x  = and consequently  ex  = =  Then A  ex  = = nearly That is the ball loses nearly the d part of its last velocity or the th part of its first velocity in passing from the gun to the pendulum by the resist∣ance of the air Or the velocity at the mouth of the gun is to the velocity at the pendulum as to so that the greater diminished by its th part gives the less and the less increased by its  d part gives the greater But if the resistance to such swift velocities as ours be about three times as great as that above computed from the nature of perfect and infinitely compressed fluids as Mr Robins thinks he has found it to be then shall the velocity at the gun lose its th part and the greater velocity will be to the less as to This however is a circumstance to be discovered from our experiments or otherwise  Of the Velocity of the Ball as found from the Recoil of the Gun  It has been said by more than one writer on this subject that the effect of the inflamed power on the recoil of the gun is the same whether it be charged with a ball or fired by itself alone that is that the excess of the recoil when charged with a ball over the recoil when fired without a ball is exactly that which is due to the motion and re∣sistance of the ball And this they say they have found from repeated experiments Now supposing those experiments to be accurate and the deductions from them justly drawn yet as they have been made only with small balls and small charges of powder it may still be doubted whether the same law will hold good when applied to such cannon balls and large charges of powder as those used in our present experiments Which is a circumstance that remains to be determined from the results of them And this determination will be easily made by comparing the velocity of the ball as computed from this law with that which is computed from the vibration of the ballistic pendulum For if the law hold good in such cases as these then the velocity of the ball as deduced from the vibration of the gun will exceed that which is deduced from the vibration of the pendulum by as much as the velocity is diminished by the resistance of the air between the gun and the pendulum  Taking this for granted then in the mean time namely that the effect of the charge of powder on the recoil of the gun is the same either with or without a ball it will be proper here to investigate a for∣mula for computing the velocity of the ball from the recoil of the gun Now upon the foregoing principle if the chord of vibration be found for any charge without a ball and then for the same charge with a ball the difference of those chords will be equal to the chord which is due to the motion of the ball This follows from the property of a circle and a body descending along it namely that the velocity is always as the chord of the arc described in a semivibration  Let then  c  denote this difference of the two chords that is  c  = the chord of arc due to the ball's velocity G = weight of the gun and iron stem c  b  = weight of the ball  g  = distance of center of gravity of G  o  = distance of its center of oscillation  n  = its N  o  of oscillations per minute  i  = distance of the gun's axis or point of impact  r  = radius of arc or chord  c v  = velocity of the ball v = velocity of the gun or of the axis of its bore  Then because  biiv  is the sum of the momenta of the ball and  Ggo  v the sum of the momenta of the gun and because action and reaction are equal these two must be equal to each other that is  biiv  = G  go  v But because v is the velocity of the distance  i  therefore by similar figures  i  ∶  o  ∷ v ∶  D  V  i  the velocity of the center of oscillation And because the velocity of this center is equal to the velocity generated by gravity in descending perpendicularly through the height or versed sine  of the arc described by it and because  r  ∶  c  ∷  c  ∶  cc    r  = versed sine to radius  r  and  r  ∶  o  ∷  cc    r  ∶  cco    rr  = vers sine to radius  o  therefore √  h  ∶ √  cco    rr  ∷  h  ∶  c    r  √  ho  the velocity of the center of oscillation as deduced from the chord  c  of the arc described where  h  = feet which velocity was before found =  o  v  i  Therefore  o  V  i  =  c    r  √  ho  or  o  V =  ci    r  √  ho  Then this value of  o  v being substituted in the first equation  biiv  = G  go  v we have  biiv  = G  gci    r  √  ho  and hence the ve∣locity  v  = G  gc    bir  √  ho  = G  gc    bir  √  o  being the formula by which the velocity of the ball will be found in terms of the distance of the center of oscillation and the other quantities Which is exactly similar to the formula for the same velocity by means of the pendulum in Art using only G or the weight of the gun for  p  +  b  or the sum of the weights of the ball and pendulum  And if instead of √  o  be substituted its value √  nn  or  n  from Art it becomes  v  = × G  gc    birn  or = × G  gc    birn  the formula for the velocity of the ball in terms of the number of vi∣brations which the gun will make in one minute and the other quantities  Farther as the quantities G  g b i r n  commonly remain the same the velocity will be directly as the chord  c  So that if we assume a case in which the chord shall be and call its corresponding velocity  u  then shall  v  =  cu  or the velocity corresponding to any  other chord  c  will be found by multiplying that chord  c  by the first velocity  u  answering to the chord  Now by the following experiments the usual values of those literal quantities were as follows viz G =  g  =  b  = sometimes a little more or less  i  =  r  =  n  = for the gun n  o  but the th part more for n  o  and the th part less for n  o  and the th part less for n  o    Then writing these values in the theorem instead of the letters it be∣comes  v  =  c  So that the number multiplied by the difference between two chords described with any charge the one with and the other without a ball will give the velocity of the ball when the dimensions are as stated above And when the values of any of the let∣ters vary from these it is but increasing or diminishing that product in the same proportion according as the letter belongs to the numerator or denominator in the general formula ×  Ggc    birn  When such va∣riations happen they will be mentioned in each day's experiments And farther when only the values of G  g i n  are as before speci∣fied the same formula will become ×  c    br  But note that these rules are adapted to the gun n  o  only therefore for n  o  we must subtract the th part and add the th part for n  o  and add the th part for n  o    OF THE EXPERIMENTS  WE shall now proceed to state the circumstances of the experi∣ments for each day separately as they happened by this means shewing all the processes for each set of experiments with the failure or success of every trial and mode of operation and from which also any person may recompute all the results and otherwise combine and draw con∣clusions from them as occasion may require Making but a very few cursory remarks on each day's experiments to explain them when ne∣cessary and reserving the chief philosophical deductions to be drawn and stated together after the close of the experiments in a more con∣nected and methodical way  The machinery having been made as perfect as the circumstances would permit barrels of government powder were procured all by the best maker and numbered from to A great number of iron balls were also cast on purpose very round and their accidental asperi∣ties ground off they were a little varied in their size and weight but most of them almost equal to the diameter of the bore so as to have but little windage The powder was uniformly mixed and every day exactly weighed off by the same careful man and put up in very thin flannel bags of a size just to fit the bore of the gun a thread was tied round close by the powder after being shaken down and the flan∣nel cut off close by the thread so as to leave as short a neck as possible to the bag The charge of powder was pushed gently down to the lower or breech end of the bore and the same quantity of powder al∣ways made to occupy nearly the same extent by means of the divisions of inches and tenths marked on the ramrod The ball was then put in without using any wads and set close to the charge of powder and kept in its place by a fine thread crossed two or three times about it which by its friction gave it a hold of the sides of the bore as the windage was very small The gun was directed point blank or horizontal and  perpendicular to the face of the pendulum block ½ feet distant from the trunnions and was well wiped and cleaned out after each discharge which was made by piercing the bottom of the charge through the vent and firing it by means of a small tube An account was kept of the barometer and thermometer placed within a house adjoining and shaded from the sun  The machinery having been all prepared and set up in a convenient place in Woolwich Warren Major Blomefield and I went out on the th of June with a sufficient party of men to try the effects of them for the first time which were as follows    Friday June    from    till    A M  The weather was warm dry and clear  The barometer at and thermometer at °  The intention of this day's experiments was to try and adjust the apparatus to ascertain the proper distance of the pendulum as also the comparative strength of the different barrels of powder by firing several charges of it without balls or wads Out of the barrels of powder were selected the which had been found to be most uniform and nearest alike by the different eprouvettes at Purfleet which were n  o•  of which the first two only were tried this day as below The gun was the short one n  o  and weighed this day with leaden weights and iron stem lb the distance of the tape by which the chord of its recoil was measured was not taken and it was probably a little more than the usual length inches employed in most of the experiments of this year  Here it appears that the quan∣tity of recoil increased in a higher ratio than the quantity of powder  The pendulum was not moved by the blast of the powder in these experiments     Powder        No of Experim  sort  weight  Chord of recoil

                      All the charges were in flannel bags except n  o•  and of oz each for want of bags large enough provided to put it in Each charge was rammed with two or three slight strokes A considerable quantity of the powder of n  o  was blown out unfired many of the grains were found on the ground and on the top of the pendulum block and many were found sticking in the face of it By the force of these striking it and by the blast of the powder or motion of the air the pendulum was observed visibly to vibrate a little but the measuring tape had not been put to it This was therefore now added to measure the vibration by And to try to what degree the pen∣dulum would be affected by the explosion of the powder the feet amusette was suspended and pointed opposite the center of the pendulum for the last rounds The pendulum was accordingly observed to move with the ounces but more with the ounces as appears at the bottom of the last column of the table above The pendulum being thus much affected we were convinced of the necessity of making a paper screen to place between the gun and the pendulum which we accordingly did and used it in the whole course of experiments at least in the larger charges At the last charge which was ounces of loose powder much sewer grains were blown out than with the like charge at n  o  with the short gun The recoil at n  o  is evidently less than it ought to be  owing to the quantity of unfired powder that was blown out It is re∣markable that the recoil of the two guns with the same charge both for ounces and ounces are nearly in the reciprocal ratio of the weights of the guns a small excess only over that proportion taking place in favour of the long gun as due to its superior length The recoils are each visibly in a higher proportion than the charges of powder for in the last four experiments the charges of ounces are in the continued proportion of to which their recoils are all in a higher ratio than that of to for dividing the d by the st the d by the d and the th by the d the three successive quotients are which are all above the double ratio but approximating however towards it as the charge is increased And farther if we divide these quotients successively one by another the two new ratios or quotients will be nearly equal So that ranging those recoils in a column under each other and their two successive orders of ratios in the adjacent columns we shall have in one view the law which they observe as here below where they always tend to equality                                        Again if we take successive differences between the same recoils and between these differences and then between the second differences and so on thus                                        the columns as well as the lines ascending obliquely from left to right have their numbers approaching and at length ending in the ratio of to the same as the quantities of powder    Friday June    from    till    o'clock  The air moist with small rain at intervals  The gun n  o  was mounted and loaded with all the leaden weights it was charged with the following quantities of powder sometimes with a ball and sometimes without one as denoted by the cipher o in the columns of weight and diameter of ball The radius to the tape was As these experiments were made only to discover if the leaden weights would render the gun sufficiently heavy that the recoil might not be too large with the high charges of powder and ball the pendulum block was removed to let the balls enter and lodge in the bank which was be∣hind it  Here again it appears that the recoils without balls are always in a greater ratio than the charges of powder It also appears that the recoils when balls are em∣ployed are nearly in the ratio of the quantities of powder when the charges are small but gra∣dually decreasing more and more below that ratio as the charge of powder is increased And if we subtract each recoil without a ball

There must have been some mistake in the th round as the recoil which is inches is greater than can well be expected with that charge of powder Probably the tape had entangled and been drawn farther out in the return of the gun from the recoil    Monday June    We went with the workmen and took the weight and dimensions of the several parts of the machinery both of the pendulum with its stem and of the guns with their frame or iron stem and the leaden weights to fit on about the trunnions  OF THE PENDULUM  Total weight with all the iron work about it  lb  Distance from its axis to the center

             The numbers in the last column of this table are the values of the letter  g  in the formula for the velocity by means of the recoil of the gun This letter may always be supposed to have the value inches as the two last numbers of the column differ from it but only or about the part of the whole inducing an error of only about half a foot in the velocity of the ball  The values of  g  in this last column of the table were computed in the following manner  Suppose the centers of gravity of the stem gun and leads to be all reduced to the line of the stem AT connecting the axis and center of the trunnions T in which they are situated very nearly  diagram  so that  G be the center of gravity of the stem  C be the center of gravity of the gun  T be the center of gravity of the leads  also the numbers on the righthand side of these points namely and and are the mea∣sured distances below the axis at A and the num∣bers on the lefthand side namely and are the weights of the bodies belonging to those centers of gravity Then from the property of the center of gravity we shall have these operations  where D is the center of gravity of the bodies at the points C and T or of the gun and leads and E the center of gravity of the two bodies placed at the points G and D or of all the three bodies at the points G C T that is E is the compound center of gravity for both gun iron  and leads in one mass And the some operation is to be repeated for the other guns  It may here be also remarked that the mean number of vibra∣tions per minute for every gun weighing in all lb taken among the actual vibrations of each day is for  n  o    n  o    n  o    n  o            which number must be used as the true value of  n  in the formula for the velocity of the ball by means of the recoil of the gun The number of the gun's vibrations was commonly tried every day and they were found to vary but little and among them all the numbers abovemen∣tioned are the arithmetical mediums  Moreover the mean numbers for the pendulum among all the daily measurements of its weight center of gravity and oscillations per minute are thus  weight  g  n  lb      Of the great number of these measures that were taken the variations among them would be sometimes in excess and sometimes in defect and therefore the above numbers which are the means among the whole as long as the iron work remains the same will probably be very near the truth And by using always these with proportional alterations in  g  and  n  for any alteration in the weight  p  the computations of the velo∣city of the ball will be made by a rule that is uniform and not subject at least to accidental single errors When the weight of the pendulum varies by the wood alone of the block or the straps about it the alteration is to be made at the center of the block which is exactly inches be∣low the axis that is in that case the value of  i  is in the formula  or the correction for  g  and in  the cor∣rection  of  n  But when the alteration of the weight  p  arises from the balls and plugs lodged in the same block then the value of  i  in those corrections is the medium among the distances of the point struck And when the iron work is altered the middle of the place altered gives the value of  i  in the same theorems  In these corrections too  p  denotes  g    n  and  b  the difference between and any other given weight of the pendulum which value of  b  will be negative when this weight is below other∣wise positive so that  p  +  b  is always equal to this weight of pendulum  And if these values of  p g n  be substituted for them in those cor∣rections they will become  or  i    p b  the correction for  g  and  the correction for  n  And farther when  i  = the same become  b  +  b  or  p  the correction for  g  and  b  +  b  or  p  the correction for  n  as adapted to an alteration at the center of the pendulum  And in that case G =  p  is the new value of  g  and N = +  p  is the new value of  n  But those corrections will have contrary signs when  b  is negative as well as the second term in each of the denominators    Monday June    from  ½  A M to  ½  P M  The air clear dry

in to fill up the holes after the th and th rounds weighed about ¼ oz to each inch of their length The whole weights of these plugs and the weights of the balls lodged in the block were continually added to the weight of the pen∣dulum to compleat the numbers for the values of  p  in the th column and from these numbers the correspondent values of  g  and  n  in the next two columns are computed by their proper corrections in Art and After which the velocities contained in the last column are computed by the formula in Art And the medium among all these velocities as well as that of the

the gun yesterday and the effect was very great indeed for it appeared as if it would have vibrated for a great length of time whereas on the former days it stopped motion in about minute or at least

the trunnions have gradually been knocked much out of form by the shocks of the sudden recoils so that not fitting closely they are subject to shake a circumstance which pro∣bably has occasioned the irregularities in the recoils of this day  The PENDULUM continued hanging still It is suspected that its vibrations are not to be strictly depended on with the high charges of powder owing to the striking of the balls against the iron plate within the block and so perhaps causing them to rebound within it and dis∣turb  the vibrations which are not regular this day After it was taken down the pendulum was found to weigh lb But from the weight of the balls and plugs lodged in it it ought to have weighed lb It is therefore likely that the lb had been lost by evaporation of the moisture in the days which is ½lb per day At the beginning of each day's experiments therefore ½lb is deducted from the weight of the pendulum or lb before each of the last three days And the like was done on

ball up into a still higher direction in which it struck the bank over the pen∣dulum and entered it sloping though but a little way all which cir∣cumstances shew that the force of the ball was but

and velocity of the ball by the pendulum are as follows  Powder  Recoil  Veloc                                which velocities as well as the recoils are found by adding those of each sort together

Wednesday July    c    IN the course of last year's operations we experienced several incon∣veniences from some parts of our apparatus which we determined to remedy if possible These regarded chiefly the timepieces the axes of vibration and the method of measuring by the tape For measuring the time of a certain number of vibrations we united the use of a second stop watch with a simple halfsecond pendulum made of a leaden bullet suspended by a silken thread which did not always agree together Again the axes of the gun and pendulum frames were not found to be so devoid of friction as might be wished But above all the chief cause of dissatisfaction was the method of measuring the extent of the vibrations by means of the tape which was notwithstanding all pos∣sible care and precaution still subject to much irregularity by being wetted by rain or blown aside by the wind or otherwise entangled which rendered the measurements doubtful and irregular  The preceding part of this year therefore was employed in correcting these and other smaller imperfections in the apparatus To our timepieces we added a peculiar one which measures time to th parts of a secondNext by a happy contrivance the friction of the axes was almost intirely taken off This was effected by means of sockets of a peculiar construction for the axes to work in First imagine the half of a short cylinder of or inches long cut lengthways through the axis and of a diameter a very little more than the ends of the axis that are intended to work in it if this were all it is evident that the axis in  vibrating would touch this socket in one line only because their diame∣ters were unequal Next imagine the inside of this socket to be gra∣dually ground down towards each end from nothing in the middle so that the inside resembled a tube having its two ends bent downwards and rising highest in the middle Then it is evident that the axis will touch the socket in this one middle point only And farther the under sides of the axis itself were ground a little to bring the undermost line to an edge something like the pivots of a scale beam The conse∣quence was that the friction was not sensible in a great number of vi∣brations and hereafter we commonly made the gun and pendulum vibrate for just minutes and divided the counted number of vibra∣tions by for the mean number per minuteAnd for measuring the arcs of vibration more certainly and accurately we have constructed a strong wooden circular arch of about feet in length cut out to a radius of just feet This arch is divided into chords of equal parts each the th part of the radius or th parts of an inch as before described in Art This arch being placed feet below and con∣centric with the axis and the groove in the middle of it filled with the soft composition of soap and wax the stylette or small sharp spear traces in the groove the extent of the vibration and the corresponding divisions on each side of the groove shew the length of the chord vibra∣ted And as these chords are in th parts of the radius the value of  r  in the theorem for the velocity of the ball will be for all the following experiments and then that theorem will become  v  = ×  p  +  b    bin gc  by the pendulum and  v  = × G  gc    bin  by the recoil of the gun Or  v  = ×  c b  or ×  c b  by the gun n  o  when we substitute the values of G  g i n  specified in Art And farther when  b  = it is  v  = ⅙  c  The apparatus having been prepared we employed the three days July July and August in hanging it up and in weighing measuring and adjusting all the parts and trying them by firing a few rounds with powder only The rounds fired on the first of those days of ounces each with the gun n  o  weighing lb gave at the first round and at each of the other three

the future days the chords of vibration of both gun and pendulum are expressed in th parts of the radius  The GUN was n  o  We began this day with the weight of the gun and its iron frame only without any of the leaden weights Then the one set of weights was put on at n  o  and the other at n  o  This was done to try the effects of different weights of gun on the velocity of the ball experimentally to correct a common error which had been adopted from time immemorial by professional men namely that heavier guns  caeteris paribus  give the greater velocities The erroneousness of which opinion is proved by the experiments of this and some of the fol∣lowing days And it is needless to prove  a priori  to scientific men that the difference in the effects cannot be rendered sensible by any measure∣ments which we can make of the velocity  The PENDULUM was the block of last year with a new core and a facing of sheet lead Its weight taken this morning was lb  The plugs weighed ounces to inches on an average which proportion may always be used in future at least till another be mentioned  The th n  o  is doubtful and is omitted in the medium  The th was with powder only like the first six And the th was without ball having only a wad made of junk weighing z dr This made a small impression of about half an inch deep in the face of the pendulum and rebounded back And it struck the pendulum at more than inches above the line of direction  Note the center of the pendulum as before is at inches below the axis And the value of  i  for the mean distance of the points struck is  By comparing together the first rounds which are all with the same weight of gun we find that the mean proportion of the recoil with the different charges without balls is as follows  oz  oz  oz        the recoils being rather in a higher proportion than the charge of powder  If we compare the mean of the first with oz of powder and lb weight of gun with the mean of July with oz of powder and lb weight of gun we shall obtain as follows  Charge  z  z  Weight of gun  lb  lb  Recoil      So that in this instance the less charge gives a recoil in proportion to the greater charge a little above the direct ratio of the weight of pow∣der and inverse ratio of the weight of the gun For that ratio or × to × is as to  If we compare n  o  with the mean of July which are both with oz of powder they will stand thus  Weight of gun      Recoil      which shews that in this instance the same charge gives more than double the recoil to half the weight of the gun  Lastly if we compare the means of each pair of velocities with the several weights of gun we shall have as follows  mean with lb wt of gun  mean with lb wt of gun  mean with lb wt of gun  mean with lb wt of gun  mean with lb wt of gun  mean with lb wt of gun  which differences are neither regular nor greater than happen from different trials with the weight and all other circumstances the same  for the oz charge the  Mean recoil

ounces was inches  The PENDULUM as left hanging since the last day  The value of  i  or the mean among the points struck these last three days  The object of this day's business was to try the effect of different de∣grees of ramming the charge of powder with the effect of wads placed  in different positions Sometimes the powder was only set up without being compressed and sometimes it was rammed with a different number of strokes and pushed with various degrees of force but no sensible difference was produced in the velocity The wads which were of inches length firmly made of junk or ropeyarn and made large to be with difficulty pushed into the gun were diversly placed and varied in number being sometimes introduced between the powder and ball and sometimes over both But no effect was perceived from them on the velocity of the ball this being indifferently the same either with one wad or two or none at all The reason of which is probably because the balls had very little windage At the last two numbers two wads were used in most of the others only one weighing on an average about oz dr  When balls were used with the wads it was common for them both to enter the pendulum by the same hole But it is remarkable that when the wads were discharged without balls they commonly struck wide of the line of the gun by or inches and indifferently either too high or too low or to the right or left and sometimes they flew in pieces before they struck the block  The velocities of the ball in these experiments are not computed as the effects of the blow from the ball and the wad are compounded to∣gether and that in an unknown degree as the wad sometimes slies in pieces and sometimes not or strikes the pendulum with divers degrees of force at different times and also sometimes the wads enter the pen∣dulum and sometimes they rebound from it    Tuesday August    from    till    The weather thick and cloudy  N  o  Powder  Weight of  Vibration of  Point struck  Plugs  Values of

day was the effect of windage with low balls and the effect of wads both high and low ones The wads struck variously either above or below or with the ball The two wads in the last round were made of welltwisted twine and firmly bound they struck the pen∣dulum very hard blows The other wads were of junk and did not strike so hard  Here the balls being smaller and consequently the windage more the vibrations are much smaller although wads were used So that it seems the wads do not prevent the escape of the inflamed powder by the windage nor make any sensible alteration in the velocity of the ball  The velocities are not computed for the same reason as specified in the last day's experiments  The PENDULUM block had not been altered since the last day's experiments But the iron stays of the stem had been changed for others that are stronger and which weigh lb more than the old ones did And this additional lb of iron must be added to the weight of the pendulum and new theorems must be made out for determining the change in the center of gravity and the number of vibrations per minute Now this rod of uniform thickness reached from the lower side of the axis to within inches of the top of the block conse∣quently its length was inches and its middle point or center of gravity was at inches below the middle of the axis of vibration And this number will be the value of  i  in the theorem  for the place of the new center of gravity where the value of  b  is which theorem gives G = = for the center of gravity  And the same values of  i  and  b  substituted in the theorem  give N = + = for the number of oscillations  Hence then in this new state of the pendulum the value of  g  is and the value of  n  corresponding to the value of  p  or weight of the pendulum That is  p  g  n        are the new radical corresponding values of  p g n  And these va∣lues being substituted in the two general theorems namely  and  they become  and  or  nearly Which are the theo∣rems to be used now and hereafter for the values of  g  and  n  And where the distance of the center of oscillation answering to the number is  The value of  i  this day or the mean distance of the points struck is

PENDULUM as left hanging since yesterday  The mean value of  i  for the last two days is  After the experiments were ended this day the pendulum was weighed and found to be lb Now the original weight when weighed at first on the th of July seemingly with as much care as now was lb to this add ½ lb weight of balls and plugs lodged in it and lb of iron added on the th of August and they make together ½ lb from this take lb for the diminution of the leaden facing  of the pendulum by the balls striking and piercing it and there will remain only lb which the pendulum ought to weigh and which is lb less than it is actually found to weigh I cannot imagine any cause to which this difference of weight may be attributed as it is contrary to the effect heretofore experienced the pendulum having always been found to lose in weight by hanging up unless it arise from the moisture imbibed by the block in the days it was up and during all or the most part of which time it was very rainy weather and the pendulum hung uncovered And the probability of this will be heightened by considering that the block had lain by all the preceding winter and till after midsummer this year under cover in the carpenter's shop a cir∣cumstance which would make it very dry and so render it apt to im∣bibe moisture from the continually foggy atmosphere and rain which have taken place ever since it was exposed This increase of weight then being lb in the days or nearly half a pound per day I have thought it safest to divide equally among all the days by adding half a pound for each day it hung up from the beginning of this year to the end of this day's experiments  The object of this course was again to search out the maximum of the gun's charge but it is not a good set of experiments the velocities being not regular perhaps owing to the bad state of the pendulum which was very much shattered However it sufficiently appears that there is but little difference among the velocities due to and

with a new core c we attended to weigh and measure the several parts the circum∣stances of which were as follows  Weight of the pendulum  =  p  Theref to its center of gravity  =  g  And its vibrations per minute  =  n  The new stayrods of the gunframe weigh lb more than the old ones so that now     lb  The weight of iron in the frame is    Weight of gun and iron together    Weight of gun iron and leads  = G  By this additional lb weight of iron the values of  g  and  n  or the center of gravity and number of oscillations will be altered which will cause an alteration in our theorem  v  = × G  gc    bin  by which the ve∣locity of the ball is determined from the recoil of the gun in Art The values of those two letters were at Art and found to be  g  = and  n  = for the gun n  o  but the former will now become something less and the latter something greater  Now the old and new iron stayrods were nearly of equal thickness But the old rods extended only inches and the new ones inches below the axis the difference is and the half difference or ½ added to the old length gives ½ inches below the axis where the  middle or center of gravity of the additional length is situated the weight of which part is lb But the center of gravity was found to be below the axis when the whole weight was lb Here the difference of the two distances or the distance between the two weights and being inches and the sum of the weights we shall have ∶ ∷ ∶ the change of the distance of the center of gravity which being subtracted from leaves for the distance of the new compound center of gravity  Also the correction of the value of  n  will be determined by the usual formula  in which  b  =  i  =  n  =  p  = and  g  = which values being used in that formula give for the correction of  n  to which add and we shall have for the new value of  n  or number of oscillations per minute for the gun n  o  and conse∣quently for n  o  and for n  o  and for n  o  Hence then the new values for the gun n  o  are thus  G  g  n  i  r            Then using these values of G  g n i r  in the formula  v  = × G  gc    birn  abovementioned it becomes  v  = ×  c b  for the velocity by the recoil of the gun where  b  is the weight of the ball and  c  the difference between the chords of recoil with and without a ball  And when  b  = lb = oz dr the same theorem is  v  = ⅓  c  for the gun n  o  And every ½ dram in the value of  b  will alter this theorem by the th part nearly  Also for the gun n  o  the above velocity must be decreased by the th part and for n  o  increased by the th part and for n  o  in∣creased by the th part    Friday September    from    till    The weather fair but not warm  N  o  Powder  Ball's  Vibration of  Point struck  Plugs  Values of  Veloc ball  diam  wt  gun

balls and different degrees of windage  The mean weight of balls and velocity for the two weights of pow∣der and ounces are as follow        Ball's        Powder's  wt  diam  Recoil  Veloc  wt  ht  oz

weight in the ball and that in a very considerable degree instead of increasing which it ought to do if the windage were the same or the balls had the same diameter and that in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of the weight of the ball Now that ratio is the ratio of √⅛ to √⅞ or of to Therefore as ∶ ∷ ∶ the velocity the least ball would have had if its diameter had been equal to the heaviest But its velocity was actually no more than and therefore the difference or of the whole or of the experimented velocity is the velocity lost by the difference of windage although this difference was only of an inch or of the caliber which is no more than the usual windage allowed in service But the force or inflamed powder lost by the same cause will be or a double part of the velocity because the velocity is as the square of the force or quantity of powder Hence then in charges with ounces of powder and a windage of of the caliber of the charge is lost or nearly a mean between ⅓ and ¼  And if the computation be made in like manner for the above charges of ounces of powder it will be found that the part of the charge lost by the same windage will be in the case of ounces of the whole which is still more than the ¼ part though somewhat less than in the case of ounces The reason of which is that the ball is sooner out of the gun with the oz charge and so the fluid has less time to escape in    Thursday September    To try the effect of firing the charge of powder in different parts of it  N  o  Powder  Ball's  Vibration of  Point struck  Plugs  Values of

weighs only lb as it has been lightened lb by turn∣ing it down to try if the velocity of the ball would be any less by making the gun lighter but no difference appears as the iron work is the gun and iron together this day weigh lb  The PENDULUM as left yesterday except that it had received a strengthening strap of iron weighing lb ½ oz which reduced to its center of gravity is placed at inches below the axis With this strap it weighed this morning before the experiments commenced lb which is lb less than it ought to be by adding all the balls and plugs to the first weight of which lb difference about lb is for waste of the leaden facing and the rest lb is probably by evapo∣ration and as the time the pendulum has hung up is days the rate  of evaporation is about of a pound per day The lb loss is di∣vided equally among all the experiments that have been made  On account of the iron strap of lb added at inches as above the formula last given for the variation in the center of

IN  SEVERAL of the experiments of the two former years being not so regular as might be wished we have again under∣taken to repeat some of them and to add still more to the stock already obtained that the mediums upon the whole may be tolerably exact the great number of repetitions counteracting the unavoidable small irregu∣larities and deviations from the truth in experiments instituted upon so large a scale For this purpose we begin with the gun n  o  and use charges of ounces of powder and have formed the resolution of firing every shot into a fresh and sound part of the block of wood and changing the block very frequently before it become too much bat∣tered that the penetration of the ball and the force of the blow may be obtained with the greater degree of accuracy  It is also proposed to procure some good ranges to compare them with the initial velocities made under the same circumstances from the comparison of which we may estimate the effects of the resistance of the air and so lay a foundation for a new theory of gunnery It is rather difficult to obtain with accuracy such long ranges as our initial velocities would produce being from mile to miles when the projection is made at an angle of degrees for in such long ranges our small balls cannot be seen when they fall to the ground We were obliged therefore to have recourse to the water in which the fall of the ball can be much better perceived because the plunge of the ball in the water breaking the surface and throwing it up makes the place visible at a great distance But then another difficulty occurs how to obtain exactly the distance of the fall or length of the range as the mark  made in the surface of the water is visible but for a moment This difficulty however our situation at Woolwich close by the river Thames enabled us to overcome as well as afforded us a good length of range For at our situation in the Warren the river makes a re∣markable turn and forms below us the part called the Gallions Reach a map of which is here given in plate IV In this map A denotes the point where the guns were placed being the Convicts' Wharf which is so called because it is there that the convicts or felons condemned to work on the river Thames land their gravel and upon which they usually labour From this point we have a convenient range of about a mile and a half towards B in the county of Essex where there is a private or merchant's powder magazine The buildings near C consist of the academy and a noble range of storehouses and from this point we should have had a still longer and more convenient range had not our view from hence been interrupted by four large hulks which lie for the use of the convicts in the river opposite the part between this point and the point A Having found this convenient situation for our operations we made an exact survey and map of the two sides of the river both ways beyond the extent of the ranges and fixed on con∣venient stations at D and E on the south side and F and G on the north side of the river to place two parties of observers who might mark the place where each ball should fall in the water as well as note down the time employed by the ball in flying through the air from the visible discharge of the gun to the plunge of the ball in the water The method of determining the place of the fall was this Two parties of observers consisting of three or four steady and intelligent young gentlemen in each party having taken their stands at D and F or E and G according to the expected length of the range carefully watched the discharge of every ball from the gun at A then tracing it as it were through the air by the loud whizzing noise it made in its slight their eye was prepared and directed gradually towards the place of the fall which they seldom missed of observing Then immediately  on perceiving the plunge some of them noted the time of flight by a good stop watch while others observed some remarkable land object on the opposite coast and directly in a line with the place in the water where the ball fell This done they directed the telescope or sights of an instrument such as a theodolite or plain table to that object and noted the position of it This being done by each party of observers and the line of position from each station drawn on the plan afterwards at leisure the intersection of those lines gave very exactly the place of the fall and consequently its distance from the gun In this manner then were determined all the ranges and times of flight registered in the following experiments those places being left blank where the ob∣servation was either doubtful or not made at all The times of flight were also sometimes observed at the gun itself where the plunge of the ball could often be perceived  In this map of the river in plate IV the dotted line on each side of the river denotes lowwater mark the first black line next without it denotes highwater mark and the other or outermost line is the land bank which has been raised in former ages from Greenwich for many miles below and with immense labour to prevent the waters of the river from overflowing the adjacent fields which it would do every tide as they lie low and are otherwise very marshy    Wednesday August    EMPLOYED this day in making part of the survey by the side of the river for forming the map and fixing the stations proper for the parties of observers to occupy in watching the fall of the balls in the river and for other purposes  We weighed and measured the pendulum which had been prepared in a very complete manner and with stronger bands than before It weighed just lb And by a mean of several times balancing and vibrating we found ⅓ inches to be the distance of the center of gravity below the axis and the number of oscillations per minute  After executing part of the survey by the side of the river we fired a few balls upon the water from the Convicts' or Proof Wharf to try whereabouts they will fall and thereby to judge of the proper places for the observers to be stationed at The gun was n  o  with ounces of powder and was tried at different elevations When the gun was elevated at degrees the balls ranged much too far going beyond the stretch of the river and falling on the coast of Essex below the point B But at degrees elevation the balls ranged to a very convenient distance namely a little more than a mile And their fall in the water could be very well seen from the side of the river nearly opposite the place of the fall and sometimes from the gun itself  Upon this occasion I took out with me and employed the first class of Gentlemen Cadets belonging to the Royal Military Academy namely Messieurs Bartlett Rowley De Butts Bryce Wm Fenwick Pilkington Edridge and Watkins who have gone through the science of fluxions and have applied it to several important considerations in natural philosophy Those gentlemen I have voluntarily offered and undertaken to introduce to the practice of these interesting experiments with the application of the theory of them which they have before studied under my care For although it be not my academy duty I am desirous of doing this for their benefit and as much as possible to assist the eager and diligent studies of so learned and amiable a class of young gentle∣men who as well as the whole body of students now in the upper academy form the best set of young men I ever knew in my life nay I did not think it even possible in our state of society in this country for such a number of gentlemen to exist together in the constant daily  habits of so much regularity and good manners their behaviour being indeed perfectly exemplary and the pure effect of true philosophical principles arising from a rational conviction of the propriety of a regu∣lar good conduct which is such as would do honour to the purest and most perfect state of society that ever existed in the world and I have no hesitation in predicting the great honour and future services which will doubtless be rendered to the state by such eminent instances of virtue and abilities    Thursday September    WENT out again with the same class of eight young gentlemen to complete the survey of the river side The weather changed to rain after we were out which continued the whole time and to such a de∣gree as to wet us intirely through

two former years but mounted on a small carronade carriage made for the  purpose both in the last rounds which were fired down the river and in the first rounds which were fired into the new pendulum at the same distance as formerly or about feet and each ball into a fresh part of the wood both to obtain the force of the blow the more accu∣rately and to take the penetration of the ball in the solid wood which we did every time by pushing in a wire to touch the hinder part of the ball these penetrations are various according as the part struck was more or less compact and they are rather larger than was expected the medium of all being although the block of elm as the carpen∣ters assured us was sound dry and wellseasoned wood The penetra∣tions are set down in the last column and are for the fore part of the balls the diameter having been always added to the length of the wire  The POWDER was not of the same parcel as the two former years but it was from the same maker and made as nearly similar to the former as might be The charges were gently set home and all circumstances made alike The mean length of the charge of oz was  The PENDULUM had been kept close covered with a painted canvas cloth since the first day that it was weighed and measured to preserve it from the weather The plugs weighed ounces to every inches in length the whole weight of all the plugs together with that of the balls make up lb wanting only an ounce and a half and when the pendulum was taken down and weighed this afternoon its weight was found to be lb which is just lb more than its weight at first So that it has neither lost weight by evaporation nor gained by imbibing moisture owing probably to the circumstance of being covered by the painted canvasAll the apparatus was in good order and the experiments all very accurately made  At the beginning of these experiments the values of  p g n  being  p  =  g  = ⅓  n  = if these values be substituted in the two theorems  for the

seen at the gun where the time of flight was observed by a stop watch and found to be seconds The two parties of observers at D and E had no timepiece with them so that the other times of flight could not be observed The medium range is feet or yards The last two balls went close over the heads and fell just beyond the lower party of observers at E yet not∣withstanding their imminent danger they gallantly resolved to keep their ground if any more rounds should be fired not knowing imme∣diately that we intended not firing any more at that time These two rounds were probably deslected thus a little from their course by the usual causes of deviation And perhaps the two former rounds had been still farther deflected and thrown on the land as the observers saw nothing of them But the gun was

rounds were fired this year with ounces of powder to complete the series of ranges at degrees eleva∣tion of the gun and the last three rounds with ounces to try if the powder was of the same strength as before and which by comparing these three ranges with those of last year appears to be now somewhat stronger So that these ranges and times it may be presumed are too great in respect of those of last year They are also evidently very irregular owing perhaps to the inequalities of the balls which were only the remaining outcasts from the whole stock we first began with having been rejected either from their lightness or from the irregulari∣ties of their surfaces And sometimes indeed the ranges and times here set down were not very accurately obtained The mediums of all except those marked doubtful are placed at the bottom  A SUMMARY OF THE EXPERIMENTS WITH PHILOSOPHICAL REMARKS AND DEDUCTIONS  WE have now got through this long threeyears course of experiments and have detailed them in so minute and circumstantial a manner as to enable every person fully to comprehend and make his own use of them without subjecting him to the dissatis∣faction of having mediums and results forced upon him unaccompanied with the fair and regular means of assuring himself both of their justice and propriety We are now therefore to make some use of these experiments by pointing out the philosophical laws and deductions that flow from them and making such other remarks as may be suggested by the va∣rious circumstances of them or that may be useful for improving or farther extending experiments attended with such important consequences in natural philosophy And for these beneficial purposes it will first be necessary to bring the mediums and results together into an abstract or one comprehensive point of view to form as it were the sure and regular foundation for the future structure we hope to be able to raise upon them  OF THE LENGTH OF THE CHARGE  AND first we shall deduce the lengths or heights of the charge of powder for every two ounces in weight or the part of the bore of the gun which every charge occupies a thing very necessary both to shew the part of the bore occupied by the charge corresponding to the greatest or any other velocity of the ball as also to compute  a priori  from theory the velocity due to every charge of powder Now the length of the charge was taken at every experiment by means of the divisions of inches and tenths marked on the rammer and the mediums of most of them are specified for each day in the preceding account of the experiments and those mediums of each day are here in the follow∣ing table collected and ranged in columns each under its respective weight at top extending from to ounces                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         and in the lowest line are set down the means among all the former means or numbers in each column the numbers in which last line of  means are found by adding into one sum the numbers in each column and dividing that sum by the number of those parts And thus we have obtained the mediums of the mediums for each day which must be very near the truth But to find how near they are to the truth and to correct them let these be collected and ranged as in the second column of the following table of the heights of charges or column of irregular  Wt  Irregular  Regular  oz  means  diffs  diffs  means                                                                                                        means Then take the differences between each of these and place them in the d column or irregular differences which would have been all equal if the mediums had been regular Find then a medium among these unequal differences by dividing their sum by the number of them and it will be found to be which set in the th column of regular or equal differences Then as the numbers in the d column the nearest to this mean are the differences between and ounces by supposing to be the true length of the ounce charge I form all the others from it by adding and subtracting continually the mean or common difference and place them in the last column which will therefore consist of the true regular length of each charge including both the powder and the neck of the flannel bag which con∣tained it  How much of each space was really occupied by the neck of the bag may be thus sound the first number is the length of the  charge of ounces including the neck and the common difference is the real length of ounces of powder in the bore therefore subtracting this number from the former the remainder is the mean length of the bore which was occupied by the neck of the bag in every charge And therefore taking this number from each of those in the last column the remainders will shew the real length of bore occupied by the powder alone in each of the charges  OF THE RECOIL WITHOUT BALLS  NEXT let us consider the quantity of recoil or extent of the vibration of each gun for every charge of powder and first without balls Now as these recoils were measured sometimes to one radius and sometimes to another it will be proper to reduce them all to a common radius as well as to a common weight of gun when it happens to vary in weight In the first year's experiments the radius was various and the chords of recoil were always taken in inches but in those of the second and third years the radius was constantly feet or inches which was divided into equal parts and the chords of vibration measured in thousandth parts of the radius each part being of an inch It will therefore be convenient to reduce the recoils of the first year to the same radius and parts as those of the other two years which may be done as follows Let  r  = any radius of the first year in inches and  c  = a corresponding chord of recoil taken in inches and parts  Then  r  ∶ ∷  c  ∶  c    r  the chord corresponding to the ra∣dius and measured in inches and ∶ ∷  c    r  ∶  c    r  the same chord as expressed in thousandth parts of inches  Hence then to reduce any chord of recoil in the first year multiply it by and divide the product by its own radius in inches so shall  the quotient be the corresponding chord answering to the radius inches and expressed in thousandth parts of that radius  By the foregoing rule then having reduced all the chords of recoil to the radius feet and denoted them in thousandth parts of that radius the mediums of every day's experiments collected and arranged will be as below  Table of Recoils without Balls  Charge of Powder  oz

GUN n  o                                                                                                mediums    ½                               GUN n  o                     GUN n  o                                               mediums                Some of these mediums have not the greatest degree of exactness that they are capable of for want of a sufficient number of repetitions or numbers to take the mediums of However by a very small and obvious correction the more accurate mediums for the most usual charges of and ounces of powder may be fairly stated as follows  Gun  Center of gravity  Vibrat  Length of bore  Powder              oz  oz  oz  oz  n  o  inches     inches  Recoils without Balls                                                                  The recoils being estimated in parts of which the radius is and the common weight of the gun with its frame and leaden weights being lb also the distance of the center of gravity below the axis and the number of vibrations per minute as set down in the d and d columns of the tablet above  From the view and consideration of these numbers various ob∣servations easily arise As first that by observing the four columns or vertical rows it appears that the recoil of the gun and consequently the force of the powder upon it always increases as the length of the gun increases and that in a manner tolerably regular as far as the charge of ounces but after that the increase is faster thus between the shortest bore of inches long and the longest of inches the increase in the velocity of recoil with ounces of powder is from to or about the ⅛ part with ounces of powder it is from to or the part and with ounces of powder it is from to or the part but with ounces of powder the increase is from to or the ⅕ part And this increase of recoil is chiefly  if not intirely to be ascribed to the longer time the fluid of the inflamed powder acts upon the gun in passing through the greater length of bore at least as far as to the charge of ounces but the extraordinary increase in the case of ounces seems to be partly owing to that and partly to some of the powder in this high charge being blown out unfired from the short gun And from this circumstance I would infer that the whole of the charge of ounces without ball is fired before it issues from the mouth of the short gun that is before the fluid expands through a space of ½ inches of bore And hence if the velocity of the fluid were known we could assign the time within which all the powder is fired If for instance the mean velocity of the fluid were only feet in a second though it is probably much more the time would be only about the th part of a second in which the ounces would be all inflamed  The foregoing are the rates of increase in the chord of recoil or in the velocity of the gun which is proportional to it It must be re∣marked however that the increase in the  force  of the powder will be about double of that of the recoil because the force is as the square of the velocity so that from the shortest gun to the longest the increase in the force of the powder with or ounces is about ¼ or from to and with ounces of powder the force is almost as to or the increase almost one half of the less force  Again if we contemplate the numbers on each horizontal line that is the recoils of each gun separately with the several charges of and ounces of powder we shall find that in each of them the recoil increases from the beginning to a certain part in a greater ratio than the constant ratio to of the powder increases and after∣wards in a less ratio than that of the powder That the ratio of the recoils in every gun is greatest at first or with the least charges of powder that the ratio continually decreases as the charge increases that the ratio at first is greatest with the shortest gun and so gradually  less and less all the way to the longest but that however the ratio in the shorter guns decrease faster than in the longer and so as to come sooner to the ratio of to in the shorter guns than in the longer and after that the ratios in the short guns with the same charge are less than in the long ones All these properties will perhaps appear still plainer by arranging together the several ratios for each n  o  of gun as here below     Ratios for the Gun  Powder  n  o    n  o    n  o    n  o          ½                                      means          where each column of ratios is found by dividing the recoils successively by each other from the beginning namely the recoil of oz by that of the recoil of oz by that of and the recoil of oz by that of Also the first and second lines rather decrease but the d rather in∣creases and the last or that of means also rather increases  And if we divide the first ratios in the last table but one successively by each other the d by the st and the d by the d and then again these last ratios or quotients by each other and so on we shall obtain the several orders of ratios for each gun as follows observing uniform laws  N  o    N  o    N  o    N  o                                                                         ½

      where the first column of each n  o  or gun contains the recoils with  ounces of powder the d the first ratios or the ratios of the recoils the d contains the d ratios or the ratios of the first ratios and the last column contains the d ratios or the ratios of the d ratios  Or perhaps for some purposes it will serve better to set the same table in the following form where the vertical columns are changed into horizontal lines  N  o    N  o    N  o    N  o                                                      ½                                                                                                      OF THE RECOIL WITH BALLS  BY collecting now the mean recoil of each gun for every day after reducing them all to the same weight of gun lb and weight of ball oz dr and to the same radius in the manner specified in Art they will stand as in this following table  Powder  oz                                                                                      GUN n  o                                                                                                                                                    mediums                                                               GUN n  o                                                             mediums                                           GUN n  o                                                         mediums

especially those of the last gun n  o  which has only one duplicate In this gun the recoils appear to be all rather low in respect of the others but more especially that with the charge of oz of powder which is evidently much more defective than the rest and requires an increase of about to make it uniform with the others and which increase it would probably have received from future experi∣ments had there been any repetitions of it Augmenting therefore only that number by all the orders of means will be tolerably regular and stand as below for the most usual charges of powder namely and ounces  Gun  Powder  n  o             Recoils with Balls                                          The common weight of ball being oz dr and the weight of the gun lb the other circumstances being as in Art  From the several vertical columns of this tablet of means we discover that the recoils increase always as the length of the gun in∣creases but that in the th or longest gun the increase is less in pro∣portion than in the others And from the horizontal lines we perceive that the recoil always increases as the charge of powder increases and that in a manner tolerably regular and also in continued geometrical proportion when the charges of powder are so but the common ratio in the former progression being only about ¼ of that in the latter For if the mediums for each gun be divided by each other namely the  d by the st the d by the d and the th by the d the quotients or ratios will come out as in the following tablet  Powder  Ratios for the Gun     n  o    n  o    n  o    n  o                                                means          where the numbers in the vertical columns or the ratios for each gun separately continually decrease and the numbers in the horizontal lines or for the different guns with the same weights of powder rather in∣crease in the first and third line but decrease in the second and again rather increase in the last which are the mediums of the three ratios in each column and which mean ratios are rather more than ¾ of the common ratio of the weights of powder which are ounces  And if we divide the numbers or ratios in each column continually by each other and their quotients by each other again the whole continued series or columns of ratios for each gun will be as here below  N  o    N  o    N  o    N  o

                                                                                   where the first column in each n  o  or gun contains the recoils with  ounces of powder the d column contains the ratios of those recoils the d contains the d ratios and the last the d ratios  Or the same table may for some purposes be more conveniently placed as below where the vertical columns are ranged in horizontal lines  N  o    N  o    N  o    N  o                                                                                                                                                            OF THE MEAN VELOCITY OF THE BALL FROM THE RECOIL OF THE GUN  III HAVING determined the mean recoil of the guns both with and without balls for the charges of ounces we can now assign the mean velocity of the ball for each gun and charge from the recoils if as Robins has asserted the force of the powder upon the gun be the same whether it is fired with a ball or without one For if that property be generally true then the velocity of the ball must be propor∣tional to the difference of the chords of recoil with and without a ball and that difference being multiplied by a certain constant number will give the velocity of the ball itself as we have before shewn  Now if  c  denote the difference of those chords  b  the weight of the ball G the weight of the gun  g  the distance to its center of gravity  i  the distance to the axis of the bore and  n  the number of oscillations the gun would make in a minute then we have found in Art that  × G  gc    bin  will express the velocity of the ball And that when G =  g  =  i  = and  n  = which are the medium values of those letters then the same theorem becomes ×  c b  for the velocity of the ball And farther when the mean value of  b  is or oz dr the same theorem for the velocity becomes barely  c  Subtracting however the th part in the gun n  o  and ad∣ding in the other three guns as follows namely  the th part in n  o    th part in n  o    th part in n  o    Therefore if each of the recoils without balls in the last table of Art be taken from the corresponding recoils in Art and the re∣mainders be multiplied by making the additions and subtractions abovementioned we shall have the corresponding velocities of the ball by this method And a synopsis of the whole for each gun and charge will be as in the following table  Charges  oz  oz  oz  oz  Gun n  o  Recoil  Diff  Veloc of ball  Recoil  Diff  Veloc of ball  Recoil  Diff  Veloc of ball  Recoil  Diff  Veloc of ball     with ball  without ball

                             And we shall hereafter see how far these agree with the velocities com∣puted from the vibration of the pendulum  OF THE VELOCITY OF THE BALL AS COMPUTED FROM THE PENDULUM AND GUN  THE four following tables contain the mediums of the velocities of the balls as computed for each day for all the principal charges of powder and for each gun separately one table being allotted for each In these tables all the mediums are arranged in a continued series in the chronological order as they occurred and accompanied with all the cir∣cumstances necessary to be known thus forming a fund or collection of elements from which other arrangements and principles are to be deduced  Each table consists of ten columns The first column contains the dates the next three the state of the weather and air namely the d column the hygrometer or state of the air as to dryness and moisture the d the barometer and the th the thermometer both which last instruments it must be observed were always placed in the shade and within the house while the experiments were made in the open air where it was commonly much hotter than the degree shewn by the ther∣mometer The th column contains the weight of the charge of powder the th and th the weight and diameter of the ball the th and th the velocity of the ball the former as computed from the vibration of the pendulum and the latter from the recoil of the gun and finally the th column contains the difference between these two velocities which is marked with the negative sign when the velocity by the gun is the less of the two

                The foregoing tables contain the several mediums of velocities for each day and for all varieties in the circumstances of powder and weight and diameter of ball It will now then be proper to collect to∣gether all the repetitions of the same charge or weight of powder and to take the mediums of all those mediums to serve as fixed radical numbers or established degrees of velocity adapted to all the various charges of powder and length of gun And for this purpose I shall reduce the numbers of these tables all to one common weight and dia∣meter of ball namely to the weight oz dr and the diameter inches which are the numbers that most commonly occur And this reduction will be very well deduced from the experiments of September when several trials were made with divers weights and diame∣ters of ball and with both oz and oz of powder the results of which accord very well together In the experiments of that day it was found that with the oz charges of the whole velocity is lost by the dif∣ference of of an inch in the diameter of the ball and with the oz charge of the velocity is lost by the same difference of windage But the quantity of inflamed fluid which escapes will be nearly as the difference between the area of the circle of the bore and the great circle of the ball or the force will be as the square of the ball's diameter and the velocity we know is as the square root of the force and there∣fore the velocity is as the diameter of the ball and the difference in the velocity as the difference of the diameter or as the windage Hence if  w  denote any difference of windage in parts of an inch or difference between and the diameter of any ball and  m  the part of the experi∣mented velocity lost by of an inch difference of windage then shall ∶  w  ∷  m  ∶  w    m  which last term will shew what part of the ex∣perimented velocity is lost by the increase of windage denoted by By this rule then I reduce all the velocities to what they would have been had the diameter of the ball been always It is to be noted  however that the value of  m  will vary with the charge of powder with ounces of powder it was found that  m  was of the whole velocity or ⅙ of the experimented velocity but with oz of powder  m  was found to be of the whole or of the experimented velocity We shall not be far from the truth therefore if we take the following values of  m  to the several corresponding charges of powder that is as far as oz in the guns n  o  and and then returning backwards again as the powder is increased above oz by oz at a time but in the gun n  o  to continue only to oz and then return backwards again for all above oz and for the gun n  o  to continue only to oz and then return backwards for all above that charge  Powder  Value of  m    =    ⅙ =    =    =    =    =    =    =  Such then is the reduction of the velocity on account of the windage And as to that for the different weights of the ball we know that the velocity varies in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of the weight and according to this rule the numbers were corrected on account of the different weights of ball After these reductions then are made the numbers in the foregoing tables arranged under their respective charges of powder will be as here below for a ball of diameter and weighing oz dr  Mean Velocities of Balls for all the Guns with several Charges of

mediums                      These last medium velocities for each gun will be tolerably  near the truth and the more so commonly as the number of the other mediums is the greater For want however of a sufficient number of each sort there are some small irregularities among the final mediums which may be corrected for the most part by adding or subtracting or feet as they are sometimes too little and sometimes too great And these small deviations will be very easily discovered by dividing the mediums by each other namely each of the velocities for c ounces of powder by that for ounces For we know from the prin∣ciples of forces and other experiments that the velocities will be nearly as the square roots of the quantities of powder that is while the length of the charge does not much shorten the length of the bore before the ball but gradually deviating from that proportion more and more as the charge of powder is increased in length because the force has gra∣dually a less distance and time to act upon the ball in Now by dividing the quantities of powder c by the quotients c shew the ratios of the charges and the roots of these numbers namely        c  shew the ratios which the velocities would have to each other nearly if the empty part of the bore was always of the same length But as the vacant part always decreases as the charge increases the ratios of the velocities may be expected to fall short of those above and the sooner and the more so as the gun is shorter Accordingly on trial we find the ratios hold pretty well even in the shortest gun as far as to the oz charge but in the oz charge it falls about or part below the true ratio being instead of In the longer guns the proportions hold out gradually longer and the deviations are always less and less thus in the d gun the ratio for the oz charge is about in the d it is and in the th gun it is or very nearly And so for other charges Correcting then some of the mediums by  means of this property the more accurate radical medium velocities for each gun with the several charges of and ounces of powder will be as here below  Powder  Gun n  o    N  o    N  o    N  o       Ratio  Veloc

in large characters in the middle column on the left hand in a small character is the ratio which is found by dividing each velocity by the first the law of which ratios has been mentioned above and on the right hand are the columns of first and second dif∣ferences the first being the difference between each two succeeding numbers and the second the differences of those differences  Or for some purposes it may be more convenient to rangethe veloci∣ties c as here below  Gun n  o  oz  oz  oz  oz

vertical here those which before were horizontal And where the law both of the ratios and differences is evident We also hence perceive how for each charge the velocity of the ball is continually increased as the gun is longer  And these velocities may be considered as standard radical numbers here deposited and ready to be applied to any purpose in which the consideration of the velocity can be useful And those for the other charges of powder will be as in the general table in Art  These velocities however it must be remarked are those with which the ball strikes the pendulum after passing through the air be∣tween it and the muzzle of the gun and consequently they are less than the velocities with which it immediately issues from the gun by as much velocity as the ball loses by the resistance of the air in its flight through that space Now we have found in Art that the first velocities lose at least their th part by that resistance when the air behind the ball is supposed instantly to fill up the place always quitted by the ball in its flight But as this is not exactly the case the air rushing into a vacuum with a certain finite velocity therefore the part lost will be gra∣dually more and more as the ball moves swifter till its velocity become equal to that of the air itself after which the part lost will remain con∣stant And Mr Robins asserts that the velocity lost by very swift motions is about times as great as that lost by slow ones and there∣fore that will be about the th part So that the loss will always lie between the th part and the th part I shall therefore leave it in this uncertain state till other experiments enable us to ascertain what may be the exact proportion of loss peculiar to every degree of velocity  From the general table of medium velocities in Art it is evident that for each gun the velocity increases with the charge to a certain extent where it is greatest and that afterwards it gradually decreases as the charge is increased It farther appears that the point or charge at which the velocity is the greatest is different in the guns of different lengths the charge which gives the maximum of velocity being always greater as the gun is longer And by tracing this increase of charge from the beginning to the point of greatest velocity it ap∣pears that with the st d and d guns the charges which give the greatest velocities are nearly as follows viz  Gun n  o  at the charge of oz  Gun n  o  at the charge of oz  Gun n  o  at the charge of oz  Here it will not be so proper to specify what portion of the weight of the ball these weights of powder are being no ways regulated by that circumstance but what portion of the bore of the gun is filled with these quantities of powder Now by the table of the lengths of charges in Art it appears that the lengths of the charges of and oz are these viz  oz inches gun its length  oz inches gun its length  oz inches gun its length  Then dividing each length of charge by its corresponding length of gun we obtain nearly these three following fractions viz  in gun of calibers long  ¼ in gun of calibers long  in gun of calibers long  which express what part of the bore is filled with powder when the greatest velocity is given to the ball with each of these lengths of gun And which therefore is not one and the same constant part for all lengths of gun but varying nearly in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of the length of the bore  Having so far settled the degree of velocity of the ball as de∣termined by the vibration of the pendulum we may in like manner now proceed to assign the mean velocities as deduced from the recoil of the gun The repetitions in this latter way are not so numerous as in the former but such as they are we shall here abstract them from the general tables in Art reducing them however all to the same common weight and diameter of ball as was done in Art  Mean Velocities from the Recoil of the Gun  Powder  oz

chiefly adopt those that were stated in that article for the radical standard velocities of the ball as determined from the recoil of the gun excepting in some instances when the other is used and sometimes the mediums of both So that the final mediums will be as follows  Velocities of the Ball from the Recoil of the Gun  Gun n  o  oz  oz  oz  oz                                          Let us now compare these velocities deduced from the recoil of the gun with those that are stated in Art and which were determined from the pendulum that we may see how near they will agree together And in this comparison it will be sufficient to employ the velocities for and ounces of powder this will be the most certain also as these mediums are better determined than most of the others  Comparison of

gun and pendulum with their differences is on the same line with it for the several charges of powder After the first column the rest of the page is divided into four spaces for the four charges ounces and each of these is divided into three columns in the first of the three is the velocity of the ball as determined from the vibration of the gun in the second is the ball as determined from the vibration of the pendulum and in the third is the difference between the two which is marked with the negative sign or when the former velocity is less than the latter otherwise it is positive  From the comparison contained in the last article it appears in general that the velocities determined by the two different ways do not  agree together and that therefore the method of determining the ve∣locity of the ball from the recoil of the gun is not generally true although Mr Robins and Mr Thompson had suspected it to be so and consequently that the effect of the inflamed powder on the recoil of the gun is not exactly the same when it is fired without a ball as when it is fired with one It also appears that this difference is no ways regular neither in the different guns with the same charge nor in the same gun with different charges of powder That with very small charges the velocity by the gun is greater than that by the pendulum but that the latter always gains upon the former and soon becomes equal to it and then exceeds it more and more as the charge of powder is increased That the particular charge at which the two velocities become equal is different in the different guns and that this charge is less or the equality sooner takes place as the gun is longer And all this whether we use the actual velocity with which the ball strikes the pendulum or the same increased by the velocity lost by the resistance of the air in its flight from the gun to the pendulum  OF THE RANGES AND TIMES OF FLIGHT  HAVING dispatched what relates to the velocity of the ball we may now proceed in like manner to the experiments made to determine the actual ranges and the times of flight of the balls  The mediums of these hitherto obtained are not so numerous as could be wished however such as they are we shall here collect them in the same manner as we did the circumstances relating to the initial velocities in Art  Mediums of Ranges and Times of Flight  Date

medium velocities as determined by the pendulum and here reduced to the peculiar weight and diameter of ball in each particular case of this table by the reductions specified in Art and by augmenting the velocity for the ounce charge by its th part and the others by their th part for the loss of velocity in passing from the gun to the pendulum  So that in this little table we have the following concomitant data determined with a tolerable degree of precision namely the weight of powder the weight and diameter of the ball the initial or projectile velocity the elevation of the gun the time of the ball's flight and its range or the distance of the horizontal plane From which it is hoped that the resistance of the medium and its effect on other elevations c may be determined and so afford the means of deriving easy rules for the several cases of practical gunnery a subject intended to be prosecuted in a future volume of these Tracts  OF THE BALL's PENETRATION INTO THE WOOD  I SHALL here select only the depths of the penetrations into the block of wood that have been made in the course of the last year's experi∣ments as they are the most numerous and uniform and were all made with the same gun namely n  o  I shall also select only those for and ounces of powder as they are the most useful and certain numbers for affording safe and general conclusions and besides the trials with other charges are too few in number being commonly no more than one of each  Mean Penetrations of Balls into Elm Wood  Powder                                                            means        That is the balls penetrated about  inches deep with oz of powder  inches deep with oz of powder  inches deep with oz of powder  And these penetrations are nearly as the numbers or but the quantities of powder are as or so that the penetrations are as the charges as far as ounces but in a less ratio at ounces namely less in the ra∣tio of to And are indeed so far proportional to the logarithms of the charges  Now by the theory of penetrations the depths ought to be as the charges or which is the same thing as the squares of the velocities But from our experiments it appears that the penetrations fall short of that proportion in the higher charges And therefore it would seem that the resisting force of the wood is not uniformly the same but that it increases a little with the increased velocity of the ball And this probably may be occasioned by the greater quantity of fibres driven be∣fore the ball which may thus increase the spring or resistance of the wood and so prevent the ball from penetrating so deep as it otherwise would do But it will require sarther experiments in suture to deter∣mine this point more accurately  Before we conclude this tract it may not be unuseful to make a short recapitulation of the more remarkable deductions that have been drawn from the experiments in the course of these calculations For by bringing them together into one collected point of view we may at any time easily see what useful points of knowledge are hereby obtained and thence be able to judge what remains yet to be done by future experiments Having therefore experimented and examined all the objects that were pointed out in art p  seq  we shall just slightly mention the answers to these enquiries which are either addi∣tions to or confirmations of those laid down p as drawn from our former experiments in the year  And st then it may be remarked that the former law between the charge and velocity of ball is again confirmed namely that the velo∣city is directly as the square root of the weight of powder as far as to about the charge of ounces and so it would continue for all charges were the guns of an indefinite length But as the length of the charge is increased and bears a more considerable proportion to the length of the bore the velocity falls the more short of that proportion  nd That the velocity of the ball increases with the charge to a cer∣tain point which is peculiar to each gun where it is greatest and that by further increasing the charge the velocity gradually diminishes till the bore is quite full of powder That this charge for the greatest velocity is greater as the gun is longer but not greater however in so high a proportion as the length of the gun is so that the part of the bore filled with powder bears a less proportion to the whole in the long guns than it does in the shorter ones the part of the whole which is filled being indeed nearly in the reciprocal subduplicate ratio of the length of the empty part And the other circumstances are as in this  Table of Charges producing the Greatest Velocity  Gun n  o  Length of the bore  Length filled  Part of the whole  Weight of the powder     inches  inches     oz                                          dly It appears that the velocity continually increases as the gun is longer though the increase in velocity is but very small in respect to the increase in length the velocities being in a ratio somewhat less than that of the square roots of the length of the bore but somewhat greater than that of the cube roots of the length and is indeed nearly in the middle ratio between the two But the particular degrees of velocity for each gun and charge may be seen at p and  thly It appears from the table of ranges in art p that the range increases in a much less ratio than the velocity and indeed is nearly as the square root of the velocity the gun and elevation being the same And when this is compared with the property of the velocity and length of gun in the foregoing paragraph we perceive that we gain extremely little in the range by a great increase in the length of the gun the charge being the same And indeed the range is nearly as the th root of the length of the bore which is so small an increase as to amount only to about th part more range for a double length of gun  thly From the same table in art it also appears that the time of slight is nearly as the range the gun and elevation being the same  thly It appears that there is no difference caused in the velocity or range by varying the weight of the gun nor by the use of wads nor by different degrees of ramming nor by firing the charge of powder in different parts of it  thly But a very great difference in the velocity arises from a small degree of windage Indeed with the usual established windage only namely about th of the caliber no less than between ⅓ and ¼ of the powder escapes and is lost And as the balls are often smaller than that size it frequently happens that ½ the powder is lost by unnecessary windage  thly It appears that the resisting force of wood to balls fired into it is not constant And that the depths penetrated by different velo∣cities or charges are nearly as the logarithms of the charges instead of being as the charges themselves or which is the same thing as the square of the velocity  thly These and most other experiments shew that balls are greatly deflected from the direction they are projected in and that so much as or yards in a range of a mile or almost ¼th of the range which is nearly a deflection of an angle of degrees  thly Finally these experiments furnish us with the following con∣comitant data to a tolerable degree of accuracy namely the dimensions and elevation of the gun the weight and dimensions of the powder and shot with the range and time of slight and first velocity of the ball from which it is to be hoped that the measure of the resistance of the air to projectiles may be determined and thereby lay the foundation for a true and practical system of gunnery which may be as well useful in service as in theory especially after a sew more accurate ranges are determined with better balls than some of the last employed on the fore∣going ranges  PLATE I  PLATE II  PLATE III  PLATE IV  ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS  Pa    l    for  ½  read    Pa    l    for
