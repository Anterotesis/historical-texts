FLEETSTREET J SEWELL CORNHILL AND W CREECH EDINBURGH  MDCCLXXXVIII  ADVERTISEMENT  THIS Work upon its first Appearance in the English Language having met with the most favourable Reception and been universally approved as one of the properest Books that could be put into the Hands of Children the Publisher has been induced to bring forward a Second Edition of it but in a State considerably improved for besides the Insertion of many original Pieces not to be found in the former Edition the present has been corrected throughout with the most scrupulous Regard to Expression and Uniformity and may therefore be looked upon as almost entirely a new Translation  PREFACE OF THE TRANSLATOR  THOUGH the Task of writing to improve the Minds of Children may be less productive of literary Fame than many other Studies yet in its real Importance and Utility it yields to none even of the sublimest Speculations To impress the Infant Mind with a Love of Decency and Virtue to fortify it against the Influence of Prejudice and Corruption and at once to gratify the Curiosity and improve the Reason is an Undertaking which would not disgrace the most enlightened Understanding If the Eye of the Philosopher can be gratified in merely tracing the Progress of organized Bodies from their earliest Periods of Existence to perfect Maturity how much greater must be the Pleasure of considering the successive Development of the noblest Work of Providence the human Mind A common Eye indeed may view with Indifference the Sports and Agitations of Children their Joys their Griefs their Passions and their Hopes may appear too trivial to engage its Attention not so the Man whose Feeling renders him alive to all the Interests of the Species whose  Penetration enables him to foresee the mighty Revolutions which may be produced by the Virtues or Vices of an Individual It was thus the philosophic Eye remarked in the youthful Alexander that vast Ambition which was to ravage the Globe and change the Fate of Nations it was thus that Popedius Silo discovered in the Infant Cato that stubborn and inflexible Virtue which so long opposed the Tide of Caesar's Fortune and supported the dying Liberties of Rome  But if the simple Consideration of future Greatness or distinguished Virtue be thus agreeable to a cultivated Mind how much more interesting must be the Spectacle when we consider ourselves as constituting no trifling Part of the future Drama In this Light may every Man justly consider himself who devotes his Talents and his Assiduity to the Service of the rising generation How truly noble are those Exertions which are thus directed to the Service of human Nature in the Discharge of the most important though last attractive Duties and which neglecting Fame can offer up Ambition itself a voluntary Sacrifice to the Interest of Posterity  The Author of the present Work may deservedly rank among the foremost of this deserving Class His Merit as a Writer is so well established upon the Continent and even in our own Country that it is almost superfluous to say any Thing upon the Subject His easy and elegant Pen seems to be particularly adapted to describe Nature in its most beautiful Forms The lively Passions the volatile Tastes the glowing Colours and the sportive Graces of blooming Infancy  are all at his Command But here for once the Copy may be allowed to exceed the Original His elegant Pencil seems to have given a Consistency and Permanency which Nature had denied Under such a Master nothing is cold or inanimate the very Caprices and Levities of Infancy become interesting Scenes which gradually warm the Heart and captivate the Attention The lighter and more sportive Parts of his Work exhibit all the opening Graces of the young Thalia while Melpomene herself blushes with Astonishment to find the variable Passions and shortlived Distresses of an Infant Theatre so nearly resemble her own  We flatter ourselves therefore that we shall offer to unacceptable Present to the Public in giving a complete Translation of all the Works of the admired M BERQUIN As to the Accuracy of the Translation it becomes us to be silent nor do we pretend to any higher Merit than that of being faithful Imitators of a great Original It will be a sufficient Reward for all our Labours if they tend to naturalize so excellent a Work in our own Country and if we can flatter ourselves with having thus contributed to form the Hearts and improve the Understandings of the rising Generation  Dec  THE AUTHOR's PREFACE  THE following Work has a double Object in view to amuse Children and at the same Time to incline them naturally to Virtue by always presenting it to them under the most amiable Form Instead of those extravagant Fictions those romantic and marvellous Tales which have so long contributed to lead the Imaginations of Children astray we here exhibit to them only such Adventures as they may be Witnesses to in private Life every Day The Sentiments with which the Author endeavours to inspire them are not above their Capacities and he represents them accompanied only by their Equals their Parents their Playfellows the Servants who are always about them and the Animals familiar to their View They express themselves in their own native Simplicity of Language and in Proportion as they are affected by the Incidents described they indulge the free Movement of their little Passions Their Punishments are made the Consequences of their own proper Faults and their Rewards consist in the Pleasure which they derive from their good Actions Every Thing here disposes  them to love Virtue for the Sake of their own Happiness and to deter them from Vice as from a Source of Sorrows and Mortification  It is perhaps needless to remark that this Work is equally calculated for Children of either Sex The Difference of their Tastes and Characters is not yet at their Age sufficiently strong to require to be differently delineated Besides Care has been taken to bring Children of both Sexes together as often as possible in order to produce that Union and Intimacy which we are so pleased to see subsist between Brothers and Sisters  The Author has endeavoured to introduce a Variety in the different Pieces which compose each Volume There is not one of them the Effect of which has not previously been tried on Children more or less advanced in Age and Understanding and every Thing has been retrenched that did not seem sufficiently to interest their Feelings Each Volume of this Work will contain little Dramas in which Children are the principal Characters in order that they may early learn to acquire a free unembarrassed Countenance a Gracefulness of Attitude and Deportment and an easy Manner of delivering themselves before Company Besides the Performance of these Dramas will be a domestic Recreation and Amusement The Parents having always some Part to perform in them will taste the pleasing Delight of partaking in the Diversions of their young Family and from the Gratitude of the latter and the Satisfaction of the Parent both will be mutually  attached to each other by a Bond of additional Tenderness  Independent of the moral Utility of this Work with Respect to Children it is obvious that there cannot be a more proper one to instruct them early in delivering their native Language with Ease and Propriety The greater Part of those Books which are first put into their Hands are either above their Comprehension or totally remote from their Ideas and Sentiments All the Objects on the contrary here held up to their View being of a Nature sufficiently interesting to excite their Curiosity they will of course take Pleasure in the easy Study of a Work which may render them familiar to the innocent Turn of Thought and Expression adapted to their Age and applied to describe their Amusements their Pursuits and their Necessities  CONTENTS OF THE FIRST VOLUME  THE Little Brother  Page

Germany Select passages from i  as well as from the works of Messrs CAMPE and SALEMANN will be introduced in the following performance    THE LITTLE BROTHER  FANNY arose one morning very early intending to go and gather some flowers in the garden and to make a nosegay of them to carry to her mama who was then in bed As she was just preparing to go down stairs Mr Glassford her father entered her chamber smiling and took her up in his arms saying "Good morning my dear Fanny come along with me directly I am going to shew you something which you will certainly be very glad to see" Fanny eagerly asked "What is it papa" "God has given you a little brother last night" answered he "A little brother Ah where is he Let me see him Pray carry me to him directly" Her father opened the door of the chamber in which her mother lay There was beside the bed a strange woman whom Fanny had never before seen in the house and who was wrapping up the newborn infant in its swathes Fanny asked a thousand questions to which her father answered as well as he was able and thought he had satisfied her curiosity in every thing when she said to him "Papa who is that old woman how she binds my little brother up Are not you afraid that she will hurt him"  Mr G  Oh no never fear It is an honest woman that I have sent for to take care of him  Fanny  But he belongs to mama Has she seen him yet  Mrs G  drawing back the curtain of her bed  Yes Fanny I have seen him Tell me are not you glad to see him  Fanny  Oh indeed I am mama You have given me a very pretty young companion what a cunning little face he has and all red as if he had just been running Papa will you let him play with me  Mr G  That is not possible my dear he cannot stand upon his little legs You see how weak they are  Fanny  Oh dear the little legs I see it will be a long time before we shall run about together  Mr G  All in good time He must first learn to walk and then you will soon be able to play and jump together in the garden  Fanny  Shall we O my poor little fellow I must give you something to make you fond of me Hold I have a little picture in my pocket There take that What is the matter papa the little monkey will not have it He holds his little fists shut  Mr G  He does not know how to use them yet We must wait a few months  Fanny  Is that the case aha my little man I will give you all my playthings Well are you glad of that answer me He seems to smile Call me Fanny What wont you speak  Mr G  He will not be able to speak these two years But Fanny take care that you do not disturb your mama with too much talk  Fanny  Ah papa look there his face is quite changed see he cries certainly it is because he is hungry Be quiet then my little man and I will go get you something nice  Mr G  Do not trouble yourself my dear about his victuals He has no teeth yet How should he be able to eat  Fanny  Cannot he eat What will he live upon then Must he die  Mrs G  No my child God has given me milk in my breast for the nourishment of thy little brother He is very weak as yet but after some time you shall see how he will tumble about on the floor like a little lamb  Fanny  How I long to see that But only look what a pretty tiny head I dare not touch it  Mr G  You may touch it but very gently  Fanny  Oh quite gently Oh dear how soft it is like a ball of cotton  Mr G  Every little child has such a head as your brother  Fanny  If he was to fall he would break it all to pieces  Mrs G  Certainly But we will take good care to hold him so that he shall not fall  Mr G  Do you know Fanny that five years ago you were as little as he  Fanny  As little as he Oh papa you are joking  Mr G  No my dear nothing is more true  Fanny  Yet I do not remember it  Mr G  That I believe Do you remember when I had this carpet put on the floor  Fanny  Why it has always been as it is now  Mr G  Not at all I had this carpet laid down at the very time when you were as little as your brother  Fanny  Indeed then I never took notice of it  Mr G  Little babies never take notice of what passes where the  are When your brother shall be as old as you ask him if he remembers that you tried this day to make him learn to pronounce your name You will then see if he recollects it  Fanny  What and did I suck at mama's breast too  Mr G  Certainly If you knew all the pains that she has taken for you In the first place you were so weak that you could scarce take any nourishment We were afraid every moment that you would die before our faces Your mother used to say My poor infant if she should fall into a fit and believe me she took infinite pains to get you to suck a few drops of milk  Fanny  Ah dear mama it was you then that taught me to feed myself  Mr G  Yes my child Then after your mother had succeeded in making you take to the breast of yourself you grew fat and goodhumoured Such were her cares for near two years every day and every hour of the day Sometimes when your mother was fallen asleep merely through fatigue you would disturb her rest by your cries Then would she be obliged to rise and run to your cradle My dear Fanny would she say while she endeavoured to  quiet you surely thou must be thirsty and then she would take you to her breast  Fanny  And was my head at that time as soft as my brother's  Mr G  Just the same my dear  Fanny  What mine that is so hard now Oh dear I must have broken it a thousand times  Mr G  Ah child we took so much care of you Your mother for a time renounced every pleasure and kept from all company on purpose not to lose you a moment from her sight As often as business that was absolutely indispensable obliged her to go out she was in continual apprehension for you My dear Grace she would say to your nurse I give Fanny into your care to look to her as if it were your own child and she was continually making the good woman presents to induce her to take more particular care of you  Fanny  Ah my dear good mamaBut was there ever a time papa when I could not run I that can run so well now See in three or four steps I am across the room Who was it that taught me this  Mr G  Thy mother and I We put a bandage of velvet well stuffed about your head that if you happened to fall you might not hurt yourself We then held you by leadingstrings to assist your first attempts in walking and every day we went into the garden upon the grassplat where placing ourselves opposite to each other at a little distance we set you down betwixt us standing all alone and held out our arms to invite you to come sometimes to one sometimes to the other Your slightest stumble would make our blood run cold It was by often repeating these trials that we taught you to walk  Fanny  I could never have thought that I gave you so much trouble Was it you too that taught me to speak  Mr G  Yes for that again you are indebted to us I used to take you upon my knees and repeat to you the words papa and mama until you were able to lisp them to me again Every word that you can speak this day we taught you in the same manner I dare say you can recollect that it was we also who shewed you how to read  Fanny  Oh I remember that perfectly You had me placed every day at dinner between you and at the dessert a plate of raisins was set upon the table and some small  squares marked with the letters Whenever I was so lucky as to name them perfectly you always gave me some raisins Oh it was a very pretty play  Mr G  If we had not taken all these pains with you if we had left you to yourself what would have become of you  Fanny  I should have been dead a long time ago Ah the dear good papa and mama  Mr G  And yet you sometimes vex your papa you are sometimes disobedient to mama  Fanny  I will never be so any more as long as I live I did not know how much you had done for me  Mr G  Take notice of the attention that we shall pay to your little brother and then say to yourself "I too have given my parents the same trouble"  This conversation made a lively impression upon Fanny and when she saw all the tenderness which her mother testified for her little brother all the anxiety that she felt for his health the patience which she exerted in endeavouring to make him take to his nourishment how much she was afflicted whenever she heard him cry with what tender solicitude her father relieved her of some part of her fatigue and how both one and the other took infinite pains in teaching the infant to walk and speak she would say in her own mind My dear parents have taken the same trouble with me This reflexion inspired her with so much affection and gratitude towards them that she ever after faithfully observed the promise which she had made never voluntarily to cause them the slightest uneasiness  THE FOUR SEASONS  AH if it would always continue to be winter said young Florio who was just returned from sliding and was amusing himself in the garden with making men of snow Mr Gardener his father hearing these words said to him My dear thou wilt do me a pleasure to write down that wish on my tablets Florio complied and wrote while his hand trembled with cold The winter passed away and spring succeeded Florio was walking  along with his father beside a border in the garden where the hyacinth auricula and narcissus were in perfect bloom He felt the most lively pleasure in breathing their perfume and admiring their fresh and vivid colours These are the productions of Spring said Mr Gardener to him They are beautiful but of very short duration Oh replied Florio that it were always Spring Be so good as to write that wish in my tablets Florio obeyed while his heart beat with joy The Spring very soon made room for Summer Florio one fine day went out to take a walk with his parents and some of his young acquaintance to a neighbouring village Their walk afforded them a prospect sometimes of green corn fields waving smoothly like a calm sea lightly agitated by the breeze and sometimes of meadows enamelled with a thousand flowers On every side they beheld young lambs at play and the high spirited colts and fillies sporting round their dams They eat cherries strawberries and other fruits of the season and passed the whole day in amusing themselves in the fields Do not you think Florio said Mr Gardener as they were returning to town that the Summer too hath its pleasures Oh replied he I wish it would last all the year and at the request of his father he wrote down this wish too on his tablets At length the Autumn arrived All the family went to spend a day in the country at harvest time The weather was not quite so hot as in Summer the air was mild and the sky clear The gardens and orchards were loaded with fruits The round plump melons from their rich beds diffused a delicious odour and the branches of the peartrees bent under the weight of the finest pears This was a day of feasting for Florio who loved nothing so much as grapes melons and peaches and he had the additional pleasure of gathering them himself This fine season said his father to him will soon pass away Winter is advancing towards us very fast to deprive us of the Autumn Ah answered Florio I wish it would stop short in its approach and Autumn never leave us  Mr Gard  Should you be glad of that Florio  Florio  Oh very glad papa I promise you  But replied his father taking out his tablets cast your eye a little on what is written here Read it out  Florio  reads  Ah if it would always continue to be Winter  Mr Gard  Now let us look a few leaves farther  Florio  reads  Oh that it were always Spring  Mr Gard  And on the next leaf what do we find  Florio  reads  I wish that the Summer would last all the year  Mr Gard  Do you recollect whose hand this is  Florio  It is mine  Mr Gard  And what was your wish but just now  Florio  That the Winter would stop short in its approach and Autumn never leave us  Mr Gard  This is something particular In the Winter you desired that it might be always Winter in the Spring that it might always be Spring in Summer that that season would always continue and now in Autumn you wish that it may always be Autumn Do you reflect what conclusion may be drawn from all this  Florio  That all the seasons of the year are good  Mr Gard  Yes my son they are all blest with plenteous increase and variety of pleasures and God knows much better how to govern the system of nature than we limited beings as we are If it had depended only on thee last Winter we should never have had any more Spring nor Summer nor Autumn Thou wouldest have covered the earth with eternal snows and never felt any other pleasure than that of sliding or making men of snow Of how many other enjoyments wouldest thou not have been deprived by such a disposition of things we are happy that it is not in our power to regulate the course of nature Every thing would be lost which was intended for our happiness if our own rash vows were heard  THE SNOW  AFTER many deceitful promises of its return Spring at length arrived A gentle breeze warmed the air The snow was seen to melt the fields to resume their verdure and the flowers to bud forth The singing of birds was heard on every side Little Louisa was already gone  out to the country with her father She had heard the first songs of the blackbird and the linnet and she had gathered some of the earliest violets But the weather changed once more There arose suddenly a violent northwind that whistled through the groves and covered the roads with snow Little Louisa went to bed that night shivering with cold and blessed God for having given her so comfortable a shelter from the inclemency of the air Ah what a sight when she arose the next morning Every thing was perfectly white There had fallen during the night so great a quantity of snow that it was kneedeep in the roads This made Louisa quite dull The little birds appeared still more so The ground being every where covered to a great depth they were not able to find the least grain or worm to appease their hunger All the feathered inhabitants of the grove took refuge in the towns and villages to seek the relief of man Numerous flights of sparrows linnets chaffinches and larks alighted in the streets and courtyards of houses and scraped with their claws and bills into every heap of rubbish to find if possible some nourishment There came near fifty of these guests into the yard of the house where Louisa was She saw them and returned quite afflicted into her father's chamber What is the matter my dear said he Ah papa answered she there they are all in the yard The poor little birds that sung so chearfully only two days ago They seem to be quite starved with cold and to ask for something to eat Will you let me give them a little corn With the greatest pleasure said her father The barn was on the other side of the way thither she ran accompanied by her governess to get a few handfuls of corn and hempseed and came immediately back to scatter it in the yard The little birds approached fluttering about her in great numbers and picking up every grain Louisa amused herself in looking at them and was quite delighted with the sight She went to ask her papa and mama to come and view them also and to partake of her satisfaction But these handfuls of grain were soon picked up The birds then flew up to the housetop and seemed to eye Louisa wistfully as if they would have said "Hast thou nothing more to give us" Louisa understood their language She flies like lightning to seek more grain In crossing the way  she met a little boy who had not a heart quite so compassionate as hers He was carrying in his hand a cage full of birds and was shaking it so carelessly that the poor little creatures were thrown every moment with their heads against the wires This sight gave Louisa pain What are you going to do with those birds said she to the little boy I do not know yet answered he I am trying to sell them and if nobody will buy them I shall feast my cat upon them at home Your cat replied Louisa Your cat Oh what an illnatured boy As to that they would not be the first that she has munched alive So dangling his cage as before he was setting off at a great pace when Louisa called him back and asked how much he would have for his birds I will sell them said he three for a penny and there are eighteen of them Well then said Louisa they are mine So bidding the little boy to follow her she ran to her papa and asked his permission to purchase those birds Her father granted it with pleasure and even gave his daughter an empty room for the reception of her little guests Jack that was the name of the illnatured boy went away very well satisfied with his bargain and told all his companions that he knew a little miss who would buy birds In a few hours there came so many little country boys to Louisa's door that one would have thought it the entrance to a market They all crouded round her climbing upon each other and holding up their cages with both hands each hoping to obtain the preference for his birds Louisa purchased all that were brought before her and had them carried into the chamber where the first were Night came It was a long time since Louisa had gone to bed so well pleased in her mind Am not I very happy said she to herself in being able to save the lives of so many innocent creatures and to give them food When Summer comes I will go into the fields and groves and all my little guests will sing their sweetest songs to thank me for the care that I have taken of them With this reflexion she went to sleep and dreamed that she was in a grove of trees of the finest verdure which were all covered with birds chirping as they fluttered from bough to bough or engaged in seeding their young ones The happy Louisa smiled in her sleep She rose very early to go and feed her little friends in the aviary and in the yard but she  was not now so happy as she had been the day before She knew how much money she had put into her purse and that there could not remain much of it by this time If this snowy weather should last some few days longer said she what will become of the other birds The wicked little boys will give them alive as they are to their cats and for want of a small sum of money I shall not be able to save them Full of these sorrowful ideas she draws her purse out slowly in order to count her little treasure once more but how great is her astonishment to feel her purse heavy She opens it and finds it full of pieces of coin of every sort indiscriminately up to the very strings She runs immediately to her father and relates the incident to him with transports of pleasure and surprise Her father took her to his bosom kissed her and shed tears of joy upon the cheeks of Louisa My dear child said he thou hast never made me so happy as in this moment Continue to relieve the little creatures that thou shalt see in distress and in proportion as thy purse is diminished thou shalt find it filled again What joyful news for Louisa She ran immediately to her aviary with her apronfull of hempseed and corn All the birds came fluttering round her and looked with eager eyes for their breakfast After feeding them she next went down into the yard and bestowed a plentiful meal upon the famished birds that were there She saw herself now engaged in the support of almost an hundred dependents This afforded her such a pleasure Her dolls and playthings never had given her half so much In the afternoon as she put her hand into the bag of hempseed she found a note with these words  The inhabitants of the air fly towards thee O Lord and thou givest them their food thou openest thy hand and fillest all things living with plenteousness  Her father had followed her She turned to him and said I am now therefore like God The inhabitants of the air fly towards me and when I open my hand I fill them with plenteousness Yes my dear said her father every time that thou doest good to any creature thou art like God When grown up thou shalt assist thy fellowcreatures as thou now dost the birds and thou shalt then resemble God much more Ah what happiness for a mortal to be able to act like God During a week Louisa continued to extend her bounty and  feed every thing that was hungry about her At length the snow melted the fields resumed their verdure and the birds which before had not dared to quit the neighbourhood of the houses now turned their flight toward the grove But those that had been put into the aviary remained there confined they saw the sun flew up against the window pecked at the glass but in vain their prison was too strong for them Louisa could not as yet imagine what made them so uneasy One day as she was taking them their food her father entered a few moments after her She was very happy to see that he was desirous of being witness to her pleasure My dear Louisa said he why do these birds seem so uneasy I should imagine that they want something May not they perhaps have left in the fields companions whom they would now be glad to see again You are right papa they seem to be dull ever since the return of the fine weather I will go and open the window and let them fly away I think thou wouldest not do amiss replied her father Thou wilt diffuse joy through all the country These little prisoners will go to find their friends once more and will fly to meet them as thou dost to meet me when I have been absent some time from home Before he had finished speaking the windows were all thrown up the birds perceived it and in two minutes there did not remain a single one of them in the room Some were seen to skim along the ground others to soar up into the air some to perch upon the neighbouring trees and others to fly backwards and forwards before the windows with chirpings of joy Louisa went every day to walk in the fields She saw and heard numbers of birds on every side At one time a lark would rise up before her feet and sing its sprightly strain while it mounted to the clouds At another time a linnet perched upon the highest branches of a tree chirped forth its song And whenever she observed any one to distinguish itself by the sweetness of its music Louisa would say There is one of my little guests one may know by its voice that it has been well fed last Winter  ARTHUR  A Poor labourer of the name of Bernard had six young children and found himself much at a loss to maintain them As an addition to his misfortune the season happened to be unfavorable and consequently bread much dearer than the year before Bernard worked day and night yet in spite of his labours could not possibly earn money enough to provide food even of the most indifferent sort for six hungry children He was reduced to extremity Calling therefore one day his little family together with tears in his eyes he said to them My dear children bread is risen so dear that with all my labour I am not able to earn sufficient for your subsistence You see how I am circumstanced This piece of bread in my hand must be paid for with the wages of my whole day's labour and therefore you must be content to share with me the little that I have been able to earn There certainly will not be sufficient to satisfy you all but at least there will be enough to prevent your perishing with hunger The poor man could say no more he lifted up his eyes to heaven and wept His children wept also and each one said within himself O Lord come to our assistance unfortunate infants that we are Help our dear father and suffer us not to perish for want Bernard divided the bread into seven equal shares he kept one for himself and distributed the rest amongst his children But one of them named Arthur refused to take his portion and said I cannot eat any thing father I find myself sick Do you take my part or divide it amongst the rest My poor child what is the matter with thee said Bernard taking him up in his arms I am sick answered Arthur very sick I would go to bed Bernard carried him to bed and the next morning overwhelmed with sorrow he went to a physician and besought him for charity to come and see his sick child and to assist him The physician who was a man of great humanity went to Bernard's house though he was very sure of not being paid for his visits He approached Arthur's bed felt his pulse but could not thereby discover any symptom of illness He found him however very weak  and in order to raise his spirits was going to prescribe a cordial draught but Arthur said Do not order any thing for me sir I could take nothing that you should prescribe for me  Physician  Could not take it why not pray  Arthur  Do not ask me sir it is not in my power to tell you  Phys  What hinders thee child Thou seemest to me to be an obstinate little boy  Arth  I assure you doctor it is not from obstinacy  Phys  It may be so however I shall not press you but I will go and ask the reason from your father who will perhaps not be so mysterious  Arth  Ah I beseech you do not let my father know any thing of it  Phys  Thou art a very unaccountable child but I must certainly acquaint your father with this since you will not confess the truth  Arth  O dear by no means sir I will rather explain every thing to you myself But first I beg that my brothers and sisters may quit the room  The physician ordered the children to withdraw and then Arthur continued Alas sir in this hard season my father can scarcely earn us every day a loaf of coarse bread He divides it amongst us Each of us can have but a small part and he will hardly take any for himself It makes me unhappy to see my little brothers and sisters suffer hunger I am the eldest and have more strength than they I like better therefore not to eat any that they may divide my share amongst them This is the reason why I pretended that I was sick and could not eat but I entreat you not to let my father know this  The physician wiped his eyes and said But my dear little friend art thou not hungry  Arth  Yes sir I am hungry sure enough but that does not give me so much pain as to see my family suffer  Phys  But you will soon die if you take no nourishment  Arth  I am sensible of that but I shall die contented My father will have one mouth less to feed and when I shall be with God I will pray him to give bread to my little brothers and sisters  The humane physician was melted with pity and admiration on hearing the generous child speak thus Taking him up in his arms he clasped him to his heart and said No my dear little friend thou shalt not die God who is the father of us all will take care of thee and of thy family Return him thanks that he hath led me hither I shall come back very soon He hastened therefore to his own house and ordering one of his servants to take a quantity of provisions of all sorts returned with him immediately to Arthur and his famished little brothers He made them all sit down at table and eat heartily until they were satisfied It was a delightful sight for the good physician to behold the joy of those innocent creatures On his departure he bid Arthur not to be under any concern for that he would provide for their necessities which promise he faithfully observed and furnished them every day with a plentiful subsistence Other charitable persons also to whom he related the circumstance imitated his generosity Some sent them provisions some money and others clothes and linen insomuch that very few days passed before this little family had more of every thing than was sufficient for their wants  As soon as Bernard's landlord was informed of what the generous little Arthur had suffered for his father and his brothers filled with admiration at such nobleness of soul he sent for Bernard and addressed him thus You have an admirable son permit me to be his father also I will allow you an annuity out of my own pocket and Arthur with all your other children shall be maintained at my expence in whatever professions they shall chuse If they make use of this establishment to their own advantage I will charge myself with the care of their fortunes  Bernard returned to his house transported with joy and throwing himself on his knees blessed God for having given him so worthy a child  CAROLINE  MRS P a young married lady as much distinguished for the elegant charms of her wit as for the delicacy of her sentiments and the respectability of her character was one day reproving Pamela her eldest daughter for a slight fault very pardonable at her age Pamela touched with the tender manner in which her mother delivered the reproof shed tears of sorrow and affection Caroline who was then but three years old seeing her sister weep climbs up the steps of her chair in order to reach her with one hand she takes her handkerchief and wipes her sister's eyes and with the other slips into her mouth a piece of sweetmeat from her own I think an able painter might make a charming picture on this subject  THE LITTLE FIDDLER A DRAMA in one ACT  CHARACTERS  MR MELFORT  CHARLES  his Son  SOPHIA  his Daughter  GODFREY  his Nephew  AMELIA RICHMOND and CHARLOTTE  Friends of Sophia  JONAS  the Little Fiddler  Scene Mr Melfort's House  SCENE I  Charles and Godfrey  Charles  HARK ye cousin You must do me a favour  Godfrey  Come let us see what it is Thou hast always something or another to ask me  Charles  It is because you are the cleverer of the two You know the translation of that fable of Phaedrus that our tutor has given me for a task  Godfrey  What have you not finished it yet  Charles  How do you think that I should have finished it when I have not begun it  Godfrey  You have not had time then to do it from twelve o'clock till four  Charles  You shall see now whether that was possible At eleven o'clock I could not help taking a turn or two in the garden in order to get an appetite for my dinner We were at table an hour Then to sit down and study immediately after one's meals you know how dangerous papa's doctor says that is So as I had made a hearty dinner I had occasion for a good deal of exercise to digest it you know  Godfrey  Well now at least you have had exercise enough and before dark there is more time than you want to finish your task  Charles  You do not consider that just now I must go to my writing  Godfrey  But since your writingmaster is not come  Charles  I shall wait for him It would be spoiling every thing to confound my hours of business  Godfrey  Well then after your writing you have still some of the afternoon and the whole evening  Charles  I shall not have a minute My sister expects the two Miss Richmonds to come to see her  Godfrey  It is not on your account that they come  Charles  No But then I  must  help my sister to entertain them  Godfrey  What will hinder you when the young ladies go away  Charles  O yes indeed to work by candlelight and spoil my eye  Yet my translation must be ready by tomorrow morning  Godfrey  Well whether it is or no what is that to me  Charles  And would you see me then reprimanded by my tutor and my papa  Godfrey  You always know how to get the better of me Come let me see where is this task  Charles  Above stairs in my room on the table I will go for it or rather come you along with me  Godfrey  Do you go first I shall follow you immediately  I see your sister coming this way She wanted to speak with me  Charles  But do not you go and tell her any thing of this you understand me  SCENE II  Sophia and Godfrey  Sophia  Well cousin what have you and my brother been conversing about He has certainly been playing you one of his old tricks  Godfrey  No but he has been making me one of his old requests He wants me as usual to perform his task for him against tomorrow  Sophia  And is my papa never to be informed of his idleness  Godfrey  I shall not undertake that office You know that ever since your mama's death my uncle's health has been so precarious that the least emotion makes him ill for some days Besides his generosity supports me and he might think that I wished to hurt your brother in his esteem  Sophia  Well then I shall talk to my brother the first opportunityBut do you know what I had to say to you The Miss Richmonds are coming to see me today and you must assist us in our amusements  Godfrey  Oh I shall certainly do my best cousin  Sophia  Ah here they are  SCENE III  Godfrey Sophia Amelia and Charlotte Richmond  Sophia  Ah how do you do my dear Friends    They salute each other and curtsy to Godfrey who bows to them    Charlotte  It seems an age since I saw you last  Amelia  Indeed it is a long time  Sophia  I believe it is more than three weeks    Godfrey draws out the table and gives them chairs    Charlotte  Do not give yourself so much trouble Master Godfrey  Godfrey  Miss I only do my duty  Sophia  Oh I am very sure Godfrey does it with pleasure    gives him her hand    I wish my brother had a little of his complaisance  SCENE IV  Godfrey Sophia Amelia Charlotte Charles  Charles    without taking notice of the Miss Richmonds    This is very pretty of you Godfrey to let me wait so long while you are playing the fine gentleman here  Godfrey  I thought I should be the last person in the company to whom you would direct your compliments  Charles  Oh do not be angry ladies I shall be at your service presently  Amelia  Oh pray do not hurry yourself Mr Charles    Charles takes Godfrey aside and while the young ladies converse together draws a paper from his pocket which he gives him    Charles  There it is you understand me  Godfrey  Six lines a great task indeed are not you ashamed  Charles  Hist hold your tongue  Godfrey  Ladies if you give me leave I will just step out for a few minutes  Charlotte  We shall expect your return with impatience  Sophia  Since you are going out cousin pray bid Jenny bring us in tea  SCENE V  Charles Sophia Amelia Charlotte  Charles    throwing himself into an armchair    Soh I shall take possession of this  Sophia  I think it would have been civil to ask leave  Charles  Your leave perhaps  Sophia  I am not the only person here  Charlotte  I see your brother counts us as nothing  Amelia  He thinks certainly that he does us a great deal of honour in keeping us company  Charles  Oh I know that you could do without my company but I could not so easily deprive myself of yours  Sophia  There at least is the appearance of a compliment Though I believe to say the truth the tea should come in for the greatest part of it  Charles  You are very right my dear sister in not thinking that I stay at least on your account  Sophia  Oh as to that I have too humble an opinion of my own merit All that I  should  take pride in is that I am sister to so polite a young gentleman    Jenny brings the tea and sets it before Sophia    Charles  Let me pour it out pray do  Sophia  No no that is my business you are a little too awkward If you want to do something hand these ladies their cups  Amelia  Not so much sugar for me  Sophia  Help yourself my dear to your liking    hands her a cup and the sugar bason Charles takes a cup for himself and gets hold of the sugar    Charles you have got three great lumps already  Charles  Why that is not too much I like it pretty sweet    takes several bits one after another till his sister gets the sugar bason out of his hands    Sophia  Are not you ashamed brother You see there will be none left for us  Charles  Well do not you know the way to the sugar canister  Sophia  My brother would think he had done wrong if he saved his sister any trouble  Charles  No but if you went for it I should have the pleasure of being alone with these ladies  Amelia  Do you hear that Sophia Now will you say that your brother is not perfectly polite  Sophia    having collected all the cups before her and filled them again    Charles hand Amelia this cup    Charles takes the cup and in handing it to Amelia spills the tea upon her slipThey all rise hastily    Sophia  There is an instance of his politeness    aside to Charles    I dare swear thou illnatured creature that was done on purpose  Amelia  O dear what will my mama say and what shall we do  Charlotte  This is only the second time that she has had on this slip Make haste a glass of clean water  Sophia  No I have heard that it is better to rub it with a dry linen cloth Here is a handkerchief quite clean    They go to assist Amelia Charlotte holds her slip and Sophia rubs it Meantime Charles remains at table quite unconcerned drinking his tea    Charlotte  There it begins to disappear you must let it dry  Amelia  By good luck it is in a fold where one will not think of looking  Charles    aside    That is not my fault  Sophia  There look now Charlotte I do not think it will be observed  Charlotte  If I had not seen the spot before  Amelia  Very true However Mr Charles another time I shall beg you to spare yourself the trouble of waiting on me  Sophia  Come ladies let us take our places again    Going to pour out the tea she finds the teapot empty looks angrily at Charles    Well this is a piece of ill manners that I could not have imagined Would ye believe it ladies while we were so much concerned he has taken all the tea However stop a moment I will go and order more  Charlotte  No there has been quite enough I could not drink another drop  Amelia  The misfortune of my slip has taken away my thirst  Charles  But I beg you will make no ceremony They can soon bring us more  Amelia  Really I think you should have known beforehand that your brother was to be one of the company  Sophia  Those who are not invited should at least wait until it were their turn  Charlotte  Let us not say any more about it It does not give me the least concern  Sophia  Well what shall we do now Ah here is our friend Godfrey He will help us to six on some amusement  Charles    mimicks her    Our friend GodfreyBut ladies I must speak to him before you    Goes to meet Godfrey while the young ladies are conversing together    SCENE VI  Amelia Charlotte Sophia Godfrey Charles  Charles    to Godfrey    Well have you done it  Godfrey  There take it and blush for your idleness Well Ladies have you fixed upon any amusement  Amelia  No we waited for you to determine us  Godfrey  I have a little musician below stairs at your service If you give me leave I will call him up to sing you a song or to play if you chuse to dance  Sophia  A little musician where is he where is he  Charlotte  We must own Master Godfrey knows how to amuse his company  Godfrey  At the same time that we amuse ourselves we shall do an act of charity for the poor little fellow has no livelihood but his violin  Charles  And who will pay him Master Godfrey He talks and acts as if the King were his cousin and he has not a farthing all the while  Sophia  Are not you ashamed brother  Godfrey  Let him go on cousin he does not offend me It is no crime to be poor I am the liker my little musician who is for all that a very good boy I will give him sixpence that I have remaining in my purse and he has promised to play for that all the evening  Charlotte  We will make a collection to pay him  Amelia  Yes yes we shall club  Godfrey  Shall I go for him he waits below at the door  Sophia  By all means my dear cousin and make haste    Godfrey goes out meantime Jenny brings in a cake upon a plate    SCENE VII  Amelia Charlotte Sophia Charles  Charles  I was only going to cut it up    Charles goes to take the plate from Jenny Sophia prevents him    Sophia  I shall save you the trouble you would cut it up so well I suppose that we should have no more of the cake than we had of the tea    She divides it and hands it round    Charles    after taking his share    Who is to have the piece that is left  Sophia  What is my cousin to have none  Amelia  I would rather give him my part  Charlotte  And I mine  Charles    with a sneer    He is exceedingly happy  Sophia  Can you see nothing but his cake to envy him  SCENE VIII  Amelia Charlotte Sophia Charles Godfrey leading in Jonas by the hand who has his violin under his arm  Godfrey  Give me leave to present you my young performer  Charlotte  and  Amelia  He is a smart little fellow  Sophia  Where do you come from my man  Jonas  I come from the worlds of Yorkshire ma'am  Amelia  La what has made you come thus far  Jonas  Because my poor father is blind and cannot work So we travel the country and I support him with my fiddle  Sophia  Well will you give us a specimen of your performance  Jonas  That I will with all my heart but my skill is not very great  Godfrey  Play your best at any rate it will be well enough for me and these ladies will be so good as to pardon you if you should play a little out of tune    Jonas tunes his violin Amelia in the mean time taking the plate presents the remainder of the cake to Godfrey He bows takes the plate and holds it in his hand without touching the cake while he liftens to Jonas The latter begins by playing the air of the following song then sings    I  PITY the early hardships of a boy  Whose tender hands maintain an helpless fire  Alas no other means can he employ  But that compassion which their wants inspire  II  Pity their lot who would not importune  Chill penury implores the scanty boon  Long years of toil have dimm'd the father's eyes  The other's weakness that resource denies  III  Oh let their hardships touch the bounteous breast  Relieve the aged sire and helpless boy  A little bread were wealth to the distrest  Alas 'tis all their pressing wants enjoy  Godfrey    giving him his hand    Poor child then you are both in great distress  Jonas  Alas we are so but with my fiddle I hope that we shall never be destitute If we should be sick God Almighty will take care of us and if we die we shall want nothing but a little spot of earth which may be had any where  Godfrey  But my poor little boy perhaps thou art hungry Hold here take my cake  Jonas  Oh no my pretty master eat it yourself a bit of bread serves me  Godfrey  No you shall have this I can eat bread as well as you  Jonas  Well Sir I thank you but I will not eat it now I will share it with my poor father he is not used to taste such good things  Sophia  Your poor father say you here you shall give  him  my part  Charlotte  And take mine too  Amelia  And mine  Jonas  Oh no no keep your cakes my sweet young ladies One piece is enough for me We are not used to fill our bellies with sweet things  Charles    ironically    He is right that would spoil his fine voice  Sophia  Nobody has asked you for yours  Charles  Oh I have dispatched that long ago  Godfrey  Come my man will you taste your cake first  Jonas  Oh no Master Since you are so good as to give it me allow me to wrap it up in my handkerchief and take it home  Sophia  Stop a moment I will give you a piece of linen cleaner than that and meantime you may lay your cake in the window  Jonas  I will my good young lady I come here to play upon the fiddle not to eat  Amelia  I should wish to dance a minuet with Master Godfrey Can you play any  Jonas  Whatever you please A minuet a jig or a country dance  Amelia  Let us have the minuet first    Godfrey takes Amelia by the hand to dance    Charlotte  Why cannot we both dance    advancing towards Charles    Mr Charles  Charles  Excuse me miss I can't dance  Sophia  Yet he has learned full two years  Charles  I am not in a capering humour today  Charlotte    curtsying to him    So then I am refused  Sophia  Come cousin lend me your hat    to Charlotte    I  shall have the honour ma'am to be your beau  Amelia  Then if we were to dance a double minuet  Godfrey  Miss I am at your service    They dance a double minuet after which Charlotte goes to take out Godfrey    Charlotte  Mr Godfrey now I will dance with you  Godfrey  I shall be happy miss to have that honour  Amelia  And now Sophia I will be your beau  Sophia  As this goes I find I must lose my cousin however these ladies have the first title to your complaisance    They dance another minuet during which Charles goes to the window takes Jonas's cake and slips out of the room    Sophia    to Godfrey who wipes his face    Ah you give it up you must own that we have stronger feet than you gentlemen  Godfrey  It is because you are much nimbler  Amelia    to Godfrey    If your cousin had been as complaisant as you we should soon have overmatched you for then one of us could take breath while the other two danced    They all look round for Charles    Charlotte  Ah he is gone so much the better  Jonas  Shall I play another tune or two  Godfrey  No that is enough unless ladies you would choose more The poor little fellow will be glad to go and earn something elsewhere I have already told you how little I have in my purse and Charles has gone off without paying  Charlotte  We will all contribute as well as you  Amelia  Certainly we mean it    takes out her purse    There Master Godfrey is my purse  Charlotte  And here is mine  Sophia  Hold cousin here is a shilling keep your money and this will do for us both  Godfrey  No no Sophia I have a right to pay first    They gather the money and give it to Jonas    Jonas  I will never take all that this young Gentleman promised me only sixpence  Godfrey  Take the whole my man we are very happy to be able to do you a service  Jonas  God Almighty reward you    To Sophia    Now Miss if you would please to give me a piece of old linen to wrap up the cake that you have made me take  Sophia  I had quite forgot it    runs to a drawer and takes out a handkerchief    There it is a little worn but it will do very well for your purpose  Jonas  May Heaven repay you for your generosity    goes to the window for the cake    Jonas    sorrowfully    It is not here  Sophia  What a sad boy is that he certainly has taken this poor child's cake  Jonas  Do not be concerned my sweet young Lady I am only sorry to lose it on account of my poor father  Godfrey  If Charles were not your brother his greediness should cost him dear but Jonas's father must not be a loser however My dear Sophia lend me that sixpence that you were going to pay for me just now  Sophia  No cousin I will have the merit of it all to myself    to Jonas    There my lad is sixpence buy another cake for your father    Charlotte and Amelia feel in their purses    Charlotte  Hold here are some more halfpence  Amelia  Take this too  Jonas  Oh dear no this is too much  Godfrey    taking him by the hand affectionately    How unhappy I am not to have any thing more to give thee But I am an orphan and subsist like thee upon the generosity of others  Jonas    to Godfrey    I wish that you had not brought me here or that you would take back your money  Godfrey  Do not be uneasy as to me Farewel Go and try to earn something elsewhere  Jonas    to Sophia as he is going    But take your handkerchief my good young Lady  Sophia  No keep it if you have occasion for it  Jonas  May Heaven preserve you all in good health and make you still more amiable than you are    goes out    SCENE IX  Sophia Charlotte Amelia and Godfrey  Sophia  Can you imagine any thing more shameful than the behaviour of Charles  Amelia  He should not play these pranks if I were his sister  Charlotte  I am sorry he has destroyed all the pleasure that we had in doing a service to this poor little boy  Amelia  However he is not ill off at present the cake has been pretty well made up to him  Godfrey  Very true thanks to your generosity But that does not justify the behaviour of Charles Besides poor Jonas might have had the one without losing the other  Sophia  It is you cousin that have suffered most upon the whole You have deprived yourself of your share that my goodfornothing brother might eat it    a knocking is beard at the door    Amelia Charlotte Sophia Godfrey Jonas  Godfrey  Here is our little fiddler again What is the matter my man  Jonas    crying    Oh dear oh dear Help I am ruined    The children gather round him    Sophia  What has happened to you then  Jonas  The whole of my poor subsistenceall that I had to maintain myself and my fathersee see heremy little violinit is broken all to pieces and your handkerchief and your moneyall is gonehe has taken it all from me  Godfrey  Who has broken your violin who has taken your money  Jonas  'Twas he'Twas he that took my cake  Sophia  What my brother Is it possible  Godfrey  Charles  Charlotte  It cannot be  Amelia  O the wretch  Jonas  Yes it was he it was he As I was going out of the streetdoor he came up to me and asked if I had been paid for my playing as otherwise he meant to pay me Oh yes that I have said I and even overpaid How came they by so much money says he Let me see what they have given you So I silly fool that I wasI should have remembered the cake but I thought no more of that I was so overjoyed to carry home so much money to my father Besides I had not counted it and was desirous to know the sum So I laid my fiddle down on the ground beside me and took out the handkerchief See here said I to him what I got more than was promised me at first one of the young misses gave it me I had tied up all my money in the handkerchief and was going to undo the knot when the snatched at it I guessed his roguery So he pulled one way and I another when all at once seeing where my fiddle lay on the ground he stamped on it with both his feet I loosed my hold and let go the handkerchief and so he got it from me and ran away Both my fiddle and the bow are broke and now I have neither handkerchief nor money O my father my poor father What will become of us  Sophia  Why really I do not knowI have nothing more in the world O cousin  Charlotte  Here are some few halfpence It is all that I have about me  Jonas  My sweet miss I thank you but that will not buy me a fiddle O my poor father he had it more than fifteen years  Amelia  Take this too It is the very last farthing I have  Sophia    Runs to her drawer    Here is my thimble it is gold Run and sell it my poor little man I have an ivory one that will serve me  Godfrey  No keep your thimble cousin Stop my boy I can assist you    Takes out his buckles and gives them to him    I have another pair of pinchbeck You will certainly get twelve shillings for these I can give them away for they are my own My godfather made me a present of them for my birthday    Sophia offers him her thimble and Godfrey his buckles Jonas hesitates    Jonas  No I will have none of them My father would think that I had stolen them  Sophia  Take my thimble at least  Godfrey  Wont you take my buckles you will make me angry Take them I say  Jonas  Oh dear would you have me deprive you of your ornaments  Godfrey  Do  be uneasy about that God will repay me perhaps more than I give you Your father wants bread I have no father to maintain  Sophia  Go go and take care of yourself  Jonas  At least take back your thimble  Sophia  No it is not mine now  Charlotte  If you ever pass our way I will do something for you  Amelia  'Tis in Square any body will shew you Mr Richmond's  Jonas  Oh great folks seldom ask me into their houses I am sometimes perhaps taken down into the kitchen  Sophia  Well enough of this Your father probably is uneasy on your account and ours may return very soon  Jonas  How miss your papa Do you expect him soon  Sophia  Yes go your ways else the rogue who took your handkerchief and money may take this from you too  Jonas  But I hope you are very sure not to be scolded  Godfrey  No no never fear Good bye  Jonas    As he goes out    The goodnatured little souls  SCENE XI  Sophia Charlotte Amelia Godfrey  Charlotte  I am very sorry that you have deprived yourself of your buckles Muster Godfrey  Amelia  You have set us a good example  Godfrey  I only followed that of Sophia I should be happy in the opportunity of doing a good action if it had not been furnished by the mean behaviour of Charles With what pleasure shall I now look at my pinchbeck buckles  SCENE XII  Mr Melfort Sophia Amelia Charlotte Godfrey Jonas  The children get close together Sophia and Godfrey cast a side look at Jonas and whisper each other    Mr Melf    to the Miss Richmonds    Your servant ladies I thank you for the honour that you have done my daughter But give me leave to hear in your presence what this boy has to say He was waiting for me upon the stairs and cannot leave me he says until he has spoken to me before you    to Jonas    Come what have you to say  Jonas    to Sophia and Godfrey    My good young master and miss I beg you for heaven's sake not to be angry with me but I cannot help speaking and it would be ill done of me to keep what you have made me take without the consent of your papa I know very well that children have nothing of their own to give away  Mr Melf  What is all this  Jonas  I am going to tell you sir This young master called me from his window to come in and play upon my violin for these ladies There was another little gentleman too along with them very handsome but a very illnatured rogue  Mr Melf  What my son  Jonas  I beg pardon That word escaped me Well I played my best what tunes I knew and this good little company were so kind as to bestow me a piece of cake with a handkerchief to wrap it up and almost a handful of money besides I do not know how much  Mr Melf  Well  Jonas  Well that illnatured little gentleman took away the cake which I was intending to carry to my poor father who is blind That I should not have minded but he slips out of the room and when I was going away quite overjoyed with my little bundle he watches me in the passage takes the handkerchief with all the money from me by force and breaks my violin in pieces Look ye there it is crying All my riches that supported me and my father  Mr Melf  Is it possible Such a malicious illnatured actionWhat my Son  Charlotte  His behaviour in every thing else makes this very probable Ask Sophia herself  Mr Melf  Go my man do not be afflicted I will indemnify you But is that all  Jonas  No sir only hear me Being in such trouble I returned to tell these good little gentlefolks the whole affair They had not money enough to pay for the damage so this pretty miss gives me her gold thimble and this young gentleman his silver buckles I could not possibly keep them my father would have thought that I had stolen them I knew you were coming home so I waited to return them to you and here they areBut I have no fiddle now O my fiddle O my poor father  Mr Melf  What an account thou hast given me Is it thou or you my generous children whom I should most admire Excellent boy in extreme indigence to lose all and yet from the fear of doing wrong to run the risque of letting a father whom you love perish with hunger  Jonas  Is it so great a matter not to be a rogue No no one never thrives on illgotten bread It is what my father and mother have often told me If you would only please to buy me another fiddle that will make amends for all Whatever more the thimble and buckles would have brought God Almighty will repay me  Mr Melf  Your father and you must be endowed with extraordinary uprightness of heart not even to suspect the depravity of others God will make use of me as an instrument to impart his blessings to you You shall stay here and for the first you shall wait upon Godfrey Afterwards we will see what we can do better for you  Jonas  What wait upon this little angel of a gentleman Oh I should be delighted    bows to Godfrey    But no    sorrowfully    I cannot leave my father all alone Without me how would he do to live What should I be in abundance and he die for want Oh no  Mr Melf  Excellent child and who is thy father  Jonas  An old blind labourer whom I supported by playing on the fiddle It is true he seldom eats nor I neither any thing else but a piece of bread with some milk But God always gives us enough for the day and  we take no care for the morrow he provides for that also  Mr Melf  Well I will take care of thy father and if he chuses I will get him into an almshouse where old and infirm people are well maintained You may go and see him there whenever you please    Jonas after an exclamation of joy runs about the room quite transported    Jonas  O goodness What my dear father No that will make him die with joy I cannot stop any longer but must go for him and bring him here    Runs out Sophia and Godfrey take Mr Melfort's hands They wipe their eyes    SCENE XIII  Mr Melfort Sophia Amelia Charlotte and Godfrey  Mr Melf  O my dear children how happy would this day have been for me if while I admire the generosity of your sentiments the idea of my son's unworthiness did not intervene to poison my happiness But no it should not affect it God has given me another son in thee my dear Godfrey If you are not so by birth yet you are by the ties of blood and by congenial worthiness of heart Yes you shall be my sonBut where is Charles Go seek him and bring him hither to me immediately    Godfrey goes out    Sophia  It is almost an hour since we saw him While the little boy was playing a minuet to us he disappeared with his piece of cake  Godfrey    returning    He was seen going into a confectioner's not far off I have told John to go for him  Mr Melf  Children step into my study I wish to know what answer he will have the assurance to make me When I want your testimony I shall call you  Charlotte and Amelia  Then we shall take our leave  Mr Melf  No my dears I will send word to your papa and mama that you will spend the rest of the evening with us Probably the generous little Jonas and his old father will be our guests also I have occasion for something to assuage the cruel wound that Charles has given my heart and I know of nothing more salutary than the conversation of such amiable children as you  Sophia    listening    I think I hear Charles coming    Mr Melfort opens his studydoor The children withdraw    SCENE XIV  Mr Melfort  I have long dreaded a discovery of this disagreeable nature but could never have suspected him of any thing so horrid It is perhaps still not too late to correct his vices Alas why am I obliged to try a desperate remedy  SCENE XV  Mr Melfort Charles  Charles  What are your commands papa  Mr Melfort  Where have you been Were you not in your chamber  Charles  Our tutor is gone out Godfrey was below stairs So after having studied all the afternoon I grew tired of being alone  Mr Melf  Why did not you go as well as Godfrey and join the little company that I found with your sister  Charles  And so I did but those misses treated me so ill  Mr Melf  How you astonish me  Charles  At first they drank tea but without asking me to have a drop On the contrary they shewed me all the spite in the world Then Godfrey picked up a little beggar brat in the street and brought him to play the siddle to them He gave him some of the cake that was brought up to them and me not a bit They danced but not one of the l  dies would dance with me though there were three of them and no gentleman but Godfrey What could I do here I went down to the door to look at the people passing by  Mr Melf  Only to the door What was it then that passed at the corner of the street between a little fiddler and you I have been told that you beat him and broke his violin and that he went away crying  Charles  Yes that is true papa and if I had not been very goodnatured I should have got a constable to put him in bridewell You shall hear sir When I saw him go out I said to myself I must give this poor creature  something too for his trouble for I know that Godfrey has nothing of his own and a beggar is but ill paid with only a morsel of cake So I took some money out of my purse which I gave him and he drew out a handkerchief to put it in I perceived that it was one of my sister's handkerchiefs you may see the mark I begged him very civilly to return it which he would not So I took him by the collar and we struggled together and by accident I put my foot upon his fiddle  Mr Melf    With indignation    Hold your tongue base liar I cannot bear to hear you  Charles    Drawing near to him and going to take him by the hand    Why my dear papa what makes you angry  Mr Melf  Be gone wicked creature out of my sight you shock me    He calls the children from the study    SCENE XVI  Mr Melfort Sophia Amelia Charlotte Charles Godfrey  Mr Melf  Come hither my children I will see none but those who merit my affection As for you quit my presence for ever But no stop You shall receive your sentence first    To Sophia and Godfrey    You have heard his charges against you  Sophia  Yes papa and if it were not necessary for our own justification I would say not a word against him for fear of increasing your anger  Charles  Do not believe any thing that she will tell you  Mr Melf  Be silent I have already had a proof of thy detestable falshood Lying is the high road to thest and murder Thou hast already committed the first crime and perhaps wanted only strength to attempt the other Go on Sophia  Sophia  In the first place he has done no busines at all this afternoon It was Godfrey that wrote his translation for him  Mr Melf  Is this true  Godfrey  I cannot deny it  Sophia  Then he spilt a dish of ten upon Amelia's slip and while we were busy in wipin  it he  at table and emptied the teapot There was not a drop  left for us These young ladies are witnesses    pointing to the Miss Richmonds    As to the cake  Mr Melf  That is enough All your baseness is discovered Go up into your chamber for this day tomorrow morning I will put you out of the house I will give you time enough to amend before you return and if that experiment does not succeed there are not wanting methods to dispose of incorrigible reprobates who disturb society by their misdeeds Godfrey tell John to see that he keeps his room You will give orders in the mean time that your tutor be sent to me as soon as he returns  Sophia and Godfrey    interceding for him    Dear papa Dear uncle  Mr Melf  I will not hear a word in his favor He who is capable of taking from the poor by force the earnings of his industry of breaking the instrument of his livelihood and of seeking to justify such actions by falsehood and calumny should be turned out of the society of men I thank God that he has left me still two such excellent children as you You shall be my consolation henceforward and with you I will endeavour to make myself as happy this evening as the father of so unprincipled a son can be  THE CANARYBIRD  CANARYBIRDS to sell Who'll buy my Canarybirds Fine Canarybirds Thus cried a man passing by the house of little Jessy Jessy heard him she ran to the window and looking into the street saw that it was a birdseller who carried upon his head a large cage full of Canarybirds They jumped so nimbly from perch to perch and chirped so sweetly that Jessy in the eagerness of her curiosity was near falling out of the window while she endeavoured to have a nearer view of them Will you buy a Canarybird miss said the birdman to her Perhaps I may answered Jessy but that does not depend on me entirely Stop a little I will go and ask my papa's leave The man promised to stop and seeing a bu  k on the other side of the street laid down his cage these and stood by the side of it Jessy in the mean time  ran to her father's chamber and entered it quite out of breath crying Come here papa quick make haste  Mr Gower  And what is the hurry  Jessy  There is a man in the street that sells Canarybirds I dare say he has more than a hundred He carries a great cage quite full of them on his head  Mr Gower  And why does that make you so glad  Jessy  Ah papa becausethat is if you give me leaveI should like to buy one  Mr Gower  And have you money enough  Jessy  O yes in my purse  Mr Gower  But who will feed the poor bird  Jessy  I will papa myself You'll see it will be glad to be my bird  Mr Gower  Ah I am afraid  Jessy  Of what papa  Mr Gower  That you will let him die of hunger or thirst  Jessy  I let him die of hunger or thirst Oh no certainly I sha'nt Nay I will never touch my own breakfast before my bird has had his  Mr Gower  Jessy Jessy you know you are very giddy and then you have only to neglect him one day  Jessy promised her father so fairly she coaxed him so much and pulled his coatskirt so often that Mr Gower consented at last to his daughter's request He crossed the street leading her by the hand and when they came up to the cage they chose the prettiest Canarybird in it a male of the most lively yellow with a little black tuft upon his head Who was ever so happy as Jessy then She held her purse to her father that he might pay for the bird Mr Gower then took money out of his own to buy a handsome cage with drawers and a watercup of crystal Jessy had no sooner given the Canarybird possession of its little palace than she ran to every part of the house calling her mama her sisters and all the servants and shewing them the bird which her father had been so good as to buy her When any of her little friends came to see her the first words were do you know I have the prettiest Canary Bird in the world he is as yellow as gold and has a little black crest like the plumes of mama's hat Come I will shew him to you his name is Cherry Cherry was quite happy under  Jessy's care The first thing that she thought of in the morning was to give him fresh grain and the clearest water Whenever there was any cake at table Cherry had his part of it first She had always some bits of sugar in store for him and his cage was garnished with fresh greens of one sort or another Cherry was not ungrateful to all these attentions He soon learned to distinguish Jessy and the moment he heard her step in the room what fluttering of his wings what incessant chirpings Jessy almost devoured him with kisses At the end of a week he began to sing and produced the most delightful music Sometimes he swelled his little notes to such a length that one would have thought he must expire from fatigue then after pausing a moment he would begin again sweeter than ever with a tone so clear and brilliant that he could be heard all over the house Jessy passed whole hours in listening to him as she sat by his cage She sometimes would let her work fall out of her hands to gaze at him and after he had entertained her with a sweet song she regaled him in her turn with a tune upon the birdorgan which he would endeavour to imitate These pleasures however became familiar to Jessy Her father one day made her a present of a book of prints She was so agreeably taken up with it that Cherry was something the less minded He would chirp the moment that he saw Jessy though ever so far off but Jessy heard him not Almost a week had passed since he had either had fresh greens or biscuit He repeated the sweetest airs that Jessy had taught him and composed new for her but in vain The truth was Jessy's thoughts were otherwise engaged Her birthday came on when her godfather gave her a great jointed doll This doll which she called Columbine completely banished all thoughts of Cherry From morning till night she was busied with nothing but dressing and undressing Miss Columbine a hundred times talking to her and carrying her up and down the room The poor bird was very happy to get some food towards evening Sometimes it happened that he was obliged to wait for it till the next day At length one day when Mr Gower was at table and cast his eye accidentally upon the cage he saw the Canarybird lying upon its breast and panting for breath Its feathers were ruffled and it seemed contracted all of a lump Mr Gower  went close up to it but no more fond chirpings The poor little creature had scarce strength enough left to breathe Jessy cried Mr Gower what is the matter with your Canarybird Jessy blushed Why papa I somehow I forgotand all in a tremble she ran to fetch the box of seed Mr Gower took down the cage and examined the drawer and the watercup Alas Cherry had not a single grain nor a drop of water Ah poor bird cried Mr Gower thou art fallen into cruel hands If I had foreseen this I should never have bought thee All the company rose from table holding up their hands and crying The poor bird Mr Gower put some seed into the drawer and filled the cup with fresh water but had much difficulty in bringing Cherry back to life Jessy left the table and went up into her chamber crying and made her handkerchief quite wet with her tears The next day Mr Gower ordered the bird to be carried out of the house and given as a present to the son of Mr Mercer his neighbour who was counted a very careful boy and would pay more attention to him than Jessy had done But to hear the little girl's complaints and expressions of sorrow Ah my dear bird my poor Cherry Indeed I promise you faithfully papa that I will never forget him a single moment as long as I live Only leave him with me this once Mr Gower suffered himself at length to be touched with Jessy's entreaties and gave her back the Canarybird but not without a severe reprimand for her negligence and the strictest injunction as to the future This poor little creature says he is shut up and therefore not able to provide for its own wants Whenever you want any thing you can ask for it but Cherry cannot make people understand his language If ever you let him suffer hunger or thirst again At these words Jessy shed a flood of tears She took her papa's hand and kissed it but her grief was so full that she could not utter a word Now Jessy was once more mistress of Cherry and Cherry was sincerely reconciled with Jessy About a month after Mr Gower was obliged to go into the country for a few days with his lady Jessy Jessy said he in parting with his daughter I earnestly recommend poor Cherry to your care Her parents were scarcely got into the carriage when Jessy ran to the cage and carefully provided the  bird with every thing necessary In a few hours after her time began to hang heavy She sent for some of her little acquaintance and soon recovered her chearfulness They went out to walk together and at their return spent part of the evening in playing at blindman's buff and four corners After that they danced In fine the little company broke up very late and Jessy went to bed quite fatigued The next morning she awoke by break of day and began thinking on the amusements of the evening before If her governess had let her she would have run as soon as she got up to see the Miss Marshalls but was obliged to wait till after dinner However she had scarcely finished it before she desired to be conducted to their house and Cherryhe was obliged to stay at home alone and to fast The following day was also spent in amusements and Cherryhe was forgotten again It was the same the third day and Cherrywho could think of him in the midst of such diversions The fourth day Mr and Mrs Gower returned from the country Jessy had thought very little about their return Her father had scarce kissed her and enquired after her health before he asked How is Cherry Very well cried Jessy a little confused and she ran towards the cage to carry him some water Alas the poor little creature was no more He was laid upon his back with his wings spread and his bill open Jessy screamed out and wrung her hands Every one in the house ran up and was eyewitness of the disaster Ah poor bird cried Mr Gower how painful has thy death been If I had wrung thy head off the day that I went to the country thou wouldest have had but the pain of a moment whereas now thou hast endured for several days the pangs of hunger and thirst and hast died in a long and cruel agony However thou art still happy in being delivered from the hands of so pitiless a guardian Jessy would have hid herself in the bowels of the earth she would have given all her playthings and all her pocketmoney to purchase the life of Cherry but it was then too late Mr Gower took the bird and had its skin stuffed and hung up from the ceiling Jessy did not dare to look at it her eyes were filled with tears whenever she chanced to perceive it and every day she entreated her father to remove it from her sight Mr Gower did not  consent till after many supplications on her part and whenever Jessy shewed any mark of inattention or giddiness the bird was hung up again in its place and every body would say in her hearing Poor Cherry what a cruel death you suffered  THE CHILDREN WHO WOULD BE THEIR OWN MASTERS  Camillus  AH Papa how I should wish to be big to be as big as you  Mr Orpin  And why should you wish so my dear  Cam  Because then I should not be under any body's command and might do whatever came into my head  Mr Orpin  I suppose then you would do wonders  Cam  That I should I promise you  Mr Orpin  And do you wish also Julia to be free to do whatever you please  Julia  Yes indeed papa  Cam  Oh if Julia and I were our own masters  Mr Orpin  Well children I can give you that satisfaction After tomorrow morning you shall have the liberty of conducting yourselves entirely according to your own fancy  Cam  Ah you are jesting papa  Mr Orpin  No I speak quite seriously Tomorrow neither your mother nor I nor in short any body in the house shall oppose your inclinations  Cam  What pleasure shall we feel to have our necks out of the yoke  Mr Orpin  That is not all I do not intend to give you this privilege for tomorrow only it shall continue until you come of yourselves and request me to assume my authority again  Cam  At that rate we shall be our own masters a long while  Mr Orpin  Well I shall be glad to see you able to conduct yourselves so prepare to become great folks tomorrow  The next day came The two children instead of rising at seven o'clock as usual lay in bed till near nine Too much sleep makes us heavy and listless This was  the case with Camillus and Julia They awoke at length uncalled and got up in an illhumour However they pleased themselves a little with the agreeable idea of acting in whatever manner they liked the whole day Come what shall we do first said Camillus to his sister after they had dressed themselves and breakfasted  Julia  Why we'll go and play  Cam  At what  Julia  Let us build houses with cards  Cam  Oh that is very dull amusement I am not for that  Julia  Will you play at blindman's buff  Cam  What only two of us  Julia  Well at crafts or at fox and geese  Cam  You know I cannot bear those games that oblige one to sit still  Julia  Well then mention some to your own liking  Cam  Then we'll play at riding on a stick  Julia  Ay that is pretty play for a little girl  Cam  We'll play then if you like at horses You shall be the horse and I will be coachman  Julia  On yes to lash me with your whip as you did t'other day I have not forgot that  Cam  I never do it willingly but the thing is you won't gallop  Julia  Ay but that hurts me so I won't play at any such game  Cam  You won't won't you Well let us play at hounds and hare I will be the huntsman and you shall be the hare Come make ready I shall set off  Julia  Pshaw I'll have none of your hunting You do nothing but tread upon my neels and punch me in the sides  Cam  Well since you do not chuse any of my games I'll never p  ay with you again Do you hear that  Julia  Nor I with you Do you hear that too  At these words they quitted the middle of the room where they were standing and retired each into a corner and there remained a considerable time without looking at or speaking to each other They were still in a pout when the clock struck ten The forenoon would soon pass  therefore Camillus at length approaching his  said "I must do every thing that you like Well  then I will play at drafts with you for twelve chesnuts a game"  Julia  I have no chesnuts and besides you know you owe me a dozen already You should pay me those first  Cam  Yes I owed them to you yesterday but I do not owe any thing today  Julia  And pray how did you come to be quit  Cam  Nobody has a right to ask any thing of those who are their own masters  Julia  Very well I shall tell my papa of your cheating  Cam  But papa has no power over me now  Julia  If that be the case I won't play  Cam  Then you may do as you like  They go away pouting again to the farther ends of the room from each other Camillus began to whistle Julia to sing Camillus tied knots on his whip and cracked it Julia dressed her doll and began a conversation with it Camillus grumbled and Julia sighed The clock struck again They had another hour less to play in Camillus in a pet threw his whip out of the window Julia tossed her doll into a corner They look at each other not knowing what to say At length Julia breaks silence "Come Camillus I will be your horse"  Cam  There now that is right I have a long string for the bridle See here Put it into your mouth  Julia  No not into my mouth Tie it round my waist or fasten it to my arm  Cam  How you talk Did you ever see horses have the bit any where but between their teeth  Julia  But I am not a real horse  Cam  Well but you should do just the same as if you were  Julia  I do not see any occasion for that  Cam  I suppose you think that you know more about it than I do who am all the day in the stable Come take it the right way  Julia  You have been trailing it about in the dirt all the week No I'll never put it into my mouth  Cam  Then I won't have it any where else I would rather not play at all  Julia  Just as you like  A third fit of pouting more sullen and peevish than before Camillus goes for his whip Julia takes up her doll But the whip refuses to crack the doll's dressing goes all wrong Camillus sighs Julia weeps This interval brought on dinnerhour and Mr Orpin came to ask them if they chose to have it served up But what is the matter with you said he seeing them both quite dull Nothing papa answered the children and wiping their eyes followed their father into the diningroom The dinner this day consisted of a number of dishes and a bottle of wine was opened for each of the children My dear children said Mr Orpin if I had still my former authority over you I would forbid you to taste all these dishes and particularly to drink wine At least I would desire you to be very sparing of them because I know how dangerous wine and highfeasoned food are to children But ye are now your own masters and may eat and drink whatever ye fancy The children did not wait to be told this twice The one swallowed great bits of meat without bread the other took sauce in whole spoonfuls and they drank full bumpers of wine without remembering to mix water with it My dear whispered Mrs Orpin to her husband they will make themselves sick I fear they will my dear answered Mr Orpin but I would rather that they should learn for once at their own expence how much one may suffer from ignorance than by a premature attention deprive them of the fruits of so important a lesson Mrs Orpin saw her husband's intention and therefore suffered our thoughtless little couple to indulge their greediness The cloth was now removed The children had stuffed as long as they were able and their little heads began to be heated Come with me Julia cried Camillus and took his sister with him into the garden Mr Orpin thought proper to follow them unobserved There was a little pond in the garden and at the edge of the pond a small boat Camillus had a mind to go into it Julia stopped him You know said she that we must not go there Must not answered Camillus Do you forget that we are our own masters Oh that is true said Julia so giving her hand to her brother they both went into the boat Mr Orphin drew nearer to them but did not chuse to discover himself yet He knew that  the pond was not deep Even if they fall in said he to himself I shall not have much trouble in getting them out The two children wished to disengage the boat from the bank and push it out towards the middle of the pond but they were not able to untie the knots of the rope which held it fast Since we cannot fail said the giddy Camillus we may at least balance ourselves So striding across the boat he began to press it down first on one side then on the other Their heads being a little dizzy it was not long before their legs failed them They laid hold of each other to support themselves and fell both  plump  upon the side of the boat and from thence into the water Mr Orpin flew like lightning from the place where he had been hid He threw himself into the water seized his rash children one in each hand and brought them back into the house half dead with terror They felt themselves violently sick while they were undressing and rubbing with cloths At length they were put each in a warm bed they fell alternately into a stupor and convulsions they complained of a dreadful headach and pains in the bowels were seized with frequent fainting fits and in the intervals with shudderings sickness of the stomach and difficulty of breathing In this deplorable condition they passed the rest of the day they sobbed and wept till at length they fell fast asleep through weariness Early the next morning their father entered their chamber and asked how they had passed the night Very ill answered both in a feeble voice we could not lie easy in bed and feel a sickness yet in the head and stomach Poor children how I pity you But added he a moment after what will ye do with your liberty today Ye remember that ye enjoy it still Oh no no answered both eagerly And why my little friends Ye said the other day that it was so disagreeable to be subject to the direction of others We have been well punished for our folly replied Camillus And shall take warning for a long time added Julia  Mr Orpin  Ye will not be your own masters then any longer  Camillus  No no papa we would rather be told by you what to do  Julia  It will be much better for us both  Mr Orpin  Think well of what ye say for if I resume my authority I inform you beforehand that my very first orders will be disagreeable to you  Cam  No matter papa we are ready to do whatever you shall think proper  Mr Orpin  Well I have here a yellow powder called rhubarb It has an unpleasing taste but is excellent for those who have hurt their stomachs by excess Since ye consent to follow my orders I command you instantly to take this powder Let me see you obey  Cam  Oh yes yes papa  Julia  I would take it though it were as bitter as soot  Mr Orpin gave them the medicine and the children without making as formerly any grimaces endeavoured each to excel the other in taking it with a chearful countenance This remedy happily had its effect and they both recovered very soon After that whenever their parents would terrify them with threats of punishment they would say We shall let you be your own masters and the children selt more terror from this threat than many others to whom one should say I will put you in prison  THE BUSHES  ONE fine evening in the month of May Mr Ogilby was sitting with Algernon his son upon the side of a small hill from whence he pointed out to him the beauties of nature as they lay before him The setting sun in taking his last adieu seemed to have clothed every thing in a robe of purple They were roused from this pleasing meditation by the chearful song of a shepherd who was driving back his bleating flock from a neighbouring field On each side of his road there grew up thornbushes which no sheep approached without leaving upon them some part of her fleece Little Algernon grew quite angry at those robbers Do you see papa cried he those bushes how they rob the sheep of their wool Why did God make those illnatured brambles or why do not all men join with one accord to destroy them If the poor sheep come back this same way again they will leave the  rest of their clothing upon them But no I will rise tomorrow at break of day and come with my billhook and snipsnap cut all those briars down to the ground You shall come with me papa and bring a little axe and the whole shall be finished before breakfast  We will think of your project answered Mr Ogilby But in the mean time do not be unjustly angry with those bushes Remember what we do about Lammas  Alger  What do we do then papa  Mr Ogilby  Have not you seen the shepherds arm themselves with great shears and rob the trembling sheep not of a few locks of wool only but of their whole fleece  Alger  That is very true papa because they want it to make themselves clothes but those bushes rob them out of mere spite and without having the least occasion for it  Mr Ogilby  You don't know what purpose these bits of wool may serve to them but supposing that they served none has a person any right to appropriate a thing to himself merely because he wants it  Alger  But I have heard you say papa that sheep naturally lose their fleeces about that time of the year then it is much better to take it for our use than to suffer it to fall off quite useless  Mr Ogilby  Your remark is just Nature hath given all beasts a clothing and we are obliged from them to borrow ours unless we chuse to go quite naked and remain exposed to the inclemency of the Winter  Alger  But a bush has no occasion for clothing So you see papa we must not give up our design I shall certainly cut all these thorns down tomorrow You will come along with me won't you  Mr Ogilby  With all my heart Come then now for tomorrow morning by break of day  Algernon who thought himself already an hero merely from the thought of destroying with his little arm this legion of robbers could hardly sleep taken up as he was with his victories of the next day Scarce had the chearful singing of the birds that perched on the trees near his windows announced the return of the dawn before he hasted to awake his father Mr Ogilby on the other hand though indifferent as to the fate of the thornbushes yet pleased with the opportunity of shewing to his son the beauties of the opening day was no less eager to quit  his bed They dressed themselves hastily took their instruments and set forward on the expedition Algernon went before with an air of triumph and Mr Ogilby had some difficulty to keep up with him As they approached the bushes they saw a number of little birds flying backwards and forwards amongst them and fluttering about the branches Softly said Mr Ogilby to his son Let us suspend our vengeance for a moment for fear of disturbing those innocent creatures Let us go up again to that part of the hill where we sat yesterday evening and examine what it is that those birds seem to seek so busily They went up the hill seated themselves and looked on They saw that the birds were employed in carrying away those bits of wool in their beaks which the bushes had torn from the sheep the evening before There came multitudes of yellowhammers chaffinches linnets and nightingales who loaded themselves with this plunder What is the meaning of that cried Algernon quite astonished It means replied his father that Providence takes care of the smallest creatures and furnishes them with every expedient for their happiness and preservation You see the poor birds find here a lining for the habitation which they prepare for their young They make ready you see a very comfortable bed for themselves and their little family Thus the honest thornbush against which you were so easily provoked yesterday unites the inhabitants of the air with those of the earth He takes from the rich his superfluities to satisfy the wants of the poor Will you come now and cut him down Heaven forbid cried Algernon Thou art right my son replied Mr Ogilby Let him flourish in peace since he makes so generous a use of his conquests  JOSEPH  THERE lived once in Bristol a crazy person whose name was Joseph He never went out without having five or six wigs on his head at once and as many muffs upon each of his arms Though his senses were disordered he was not mischievous and must be teazed a long time to be put in a passion Whenever he walked  the streets a number of troublesome little boys would come out of the houses and follow him crying Joseph Joseph how do you sell your wigs and your muffs Some of them were even so illnatured as to throw stones at him Though Joseph commonly bore all these insults very quietly yet he was sometimes so tormented that he would fall into a fury and take up stones or handfuls of dirt to throw at the rabble of boys Such a combat as this happened one day before the house of Mr Denham The noise drew him to the window and he beheld with grief his own son Henry engaged in the fray As soon as he perceived this he shut down the sash and went into another chamber At dinner Mr Denham said to his son Who was that man that you was running and hallooing after  Henry  You know him very well papa It is the crazy man called Joseph  Mr Denham  Poor man What can have occasioned this misfortune to him  Henry  They say that it was a lawsuit for a great estate He was so grieved at losing it that he has lost his senses too  Mr Denham  If you had known this man at the very time when he was stript of his estate and if he had said to you My dear Henry I am unfortunate I have just lost an inheritance which I long enjoyed peaceably all my property is gone to support the expence of a lawsuit I have now neither townhouse nor countryhouse in short nothing upon earth left Would you have laughed at him then  Henry  God forbid who could be so wicked as to laugh at a man in his misfortunes I should much rather have endeavoured to comfort him  Mr Denham  What then is he happier now when he has lost his reason besides  Henry  On the contrary he is much more to be pitied  Mr Denham  And yet this day you insult and throw stones at an unfortunate man whom you would have endeavoured to comfort when he was less an object of pity  Henry  My dear papa I have done wrong forgive me  Mr Denham  I pardon you willingly if you are sorry for your fault But my pardon is not sufficient There is another whose forgiveness you have still to ask  Henry  You mean Joseph  Mr Denham  And why Joseph  Henry  Because I offended him  Mr Denham  If Joseph had retained his senses it would certainly be his pardon that you should demand but as he is not able to understand what is meant by pardon it were useless to address yourself to him Yet you think that every one should ask pardon of those whom he has offended  Henry  So you have taught me papa  Mr Denham  And do you know who it is that has commanded us to have compassion upon the unfortunate  Henry  God  Mr Denham  And yet you have not shewn compassion to poor Joseph on the contrary you have aggravated his misery by your insults Do you think that such conduct does not offend God  Henry  Yes I acknowledge it and will ask forgiveness of him tonight in my prayers  Henry kept his word he repented of his fault and at night asked pardon of God from the bottom of his heart And he not only ceased to trouble Joseph for several weeks himself but he hindered also others of his comrades from insulting him In spite of his fair resolutions however he happened one day to mix in the rabble of boys who were following him 'Tis true it was purely out of curiosity and only to see the tricks that they played upon this poor man Now and then he could not refrain from hallooing like the rest Joseph Joseph and by degrees came to be the foremost in the mob At length Joseph's patience being tired by the shouts that pursued him he turned short about and taking up a large stone threw it at him with such violence that it grazed his cheek and almost cut off part of his ear Henry returned home all over blood and roaring heartily It is a just punishment on you from God said Mr Denham But replied Henry Why have I alone been hurt while my companions who used him much worse than I did have not been punished The reason is answered his father that you knew better than the others what a fault you were  committing and consequently your offence was more criminal It is very just that a child who knows the commands of God and of his father should be doubly punished whenever he has such a disregard of his duty as to violate them  THE LITTLE GLEANER  A DRAMA in one ACT  CHARACTERS  LORD BEVIL  MARCELLUS  his Son  HARRIET  his Daughter  MRS JENNINGS  EMILY  her Daughter  HARDY  Bailiff to Lord Bevil  SCENE  A new reaped field on which remain still several sheaves of corn On one side appears a nobleman's seat on the other several cottages and other objects that adorn a rural prospect  SCENE I    The stage represents a field of corn covered with sheaves    Emily    holding with both hands a basket full of ears of corn She sits down near a sheaf    COME this is not a bad beginning what joy will this be for my poor mother    she lays her basket on the ground and looks at it with an air of satisfaction    That old reaper how goodnatured he was to fill my basket I might have run about here and there all the day and never have picked up so much as half of this God reward him for it but here are still some ears upon the ground if I could only glean a handful or two    She presses down the corn ears in her basket with both hands    I can make it hold them by pressing down a little and besides I have my apron    She rises takes the two corners of her apron in one hand and prepares to put into it with the other the ears of corn that she gathers when a noise  is heard    O dear Yonder is a man coming towards me who seems to be angry Yet I do not think that I have done any harm  SCENE II  Emily Hardy  Hardy    seizing her by the arm    Ah little thief have I caught you at it  Emily  What do you say sir I am not a thief I am an honest little girl I can tell you that  Hardy  An honest little girl you an honest little girl    Snatches the bosket out of her hands    What have you got in this then my honest little girl  Emily  Ears of corn as you see  Hardy  And did these ears of corn grow in your basket  Emily  Ah if they grew there I should not have occasion to take so much trouble in gathering them up and down the fields  Hardy  Then they are stolen  Emily  Pray sir do not treat me so ill I would rather die of hunger and my mother too than do what you say  Hardy  'Blood why they did not throw themselves into your basket of their own accord did they  Emily  Oh dear you terrify me with your swearing But only hear me I went to glean down in yonder field and there was a goodnatured old man who saw me at work Poor child said he how she labours I will assist her There were some sheaves lying in the field and he pulled out of them whole handfuls of ears which he threw into my basket What is given to the poor said he God repays and  Hardy  Aha I understand you The old man in that field below filled your basket with ears that you have been pulling here out of our sheaves Heh  Emily  Nay then you may go and ask himself He can tell you  Hardy  I go and ask him yes you may wait for that I have caught you here that is enough  Emily  But when I tell you that I have not touched a single sheaf the few ears that I have in my apron I  picked up from the ground because I thought that was allowed However if you do not choose that I should I am ready to return them There these are yours  Hardy  No no these shall remain with the other and you shall remain with the basket wherever it goes Come follow me to the house of correction  Emily    Frightened    How You don't say so my dear sir  Hardy  Oh yes your dear sir but I should be much dearer if I let you escape should I not To the house of correction I say come come along  Emily  Ah pray for God's sakeI have picked up nothing here but the handfuls of ears that I returned to you What would my poor mother say if I should not go home the whole day and if she heard that I had been put in prison it would be enough to kill her  Hardy  A great loss the parish would be well rid of her  Emily    Begins to cry    Ah if you knew what a good mother she is and how poor we are you would pity us  Hardy  I am not here to pity people I am here to take them up when they trespass upon my lord's grounds and to clap them in prison  Emily  But when one has done nothing when one is innocent as I am  Hardy  Oh yes tell me of your innocence what come here and steal a whole basket full of corn and then tell me a thousand lies come come walk along  Emily  Ah my dear sir have compassion on me Take my basket if you will alas my little store will hardly make you much richer But let me go I entreat you if not on my own account at least for the sake of my poor mother I am all the comfort and help that she has  Hardy  If I let you go it is not on account of your mother at least that I can tell you I could wish her a hundred miles off it is only on your own because your whimpering has moved me a little But do not expect to have your basket too the law seizes on it as forfeit Then at sessions their worships will lay on a swinging fine and if that is not paid off to prison and turn out of the village    Takes the basket upon his shoulder Emily weeps bitterly and kneels to him    Go do not teaze me  or you will see what is to be got by that    goes off muttering    Only see if one were not always to be on the watch after them little as they are they would run away I do believe with the fields themselves  SCENE III  Emily alone      She sits down on the ground and rests her head upon a s  e  f For some moments she weeps in silence at last she rises and looks about her    Ah he is gone the illnatured man he has carried away what was all my satisfaction I have lost every thing my ears of corn my pretty basket and all and besides who knows what they will do to my poor mother and me    After a short pause    How happy those little birds are They at least are permitted to come and take some grains for their food and Ibut who knows whether some illnatured man like this be not watching them now to kill them with his gun I will frighten them all away and then I will go myself for perhaps they would punish me for having rested my head on this sheafBut what two children are those coming this way  SCENE IV  Marcellus Harriet Emily wiping her eyes    Marc  Aha was it you then little girl that the bailiff surprized just now stealing the ears of corn from our sh  aves    Emily sobs but cannot answer    Harriet    looking at her attentively and taking her brother aside    She seems to be a very good little girl Marcellus See how she cries Do not reproach her any more that will afflict her worse and it i  not worth while for a few e  rs of corn that she has picked up    Goes to her    My poor child what makes you cry  Emily  Why they accuse me unjustly and perhaps you think me in fault  Marc  Then you are not in fault  Emily  No indeed you may believe me I went into that field down there to glean An old reaper took pity on my fatigue and filled my basket with ears of corn I  then came here to pick up a few others that I saw scattered about Your illnatured bailiff found me near this sheaf and accused me of stealing He took away my basket and would have carried me to prison if my entreaties and tears for my mother had not at length prevailed on him to let me go  Harriet  Ah I should be glad to see him dare to molest you We have a good papa who does not suffer any ill to be done to the poor and who would soon have released you  Marc  Ay and who will very soon make him give you back your basket I promise you that  Emily    joyfully    O dear do you think so my sweet little master  Harriet  Marcellus and I will go and will so beg of himDo not be uneasy He is never so well pleased with us as when we speak to him in favour of poor people And besides we could get you your basket again without speaking to him  Emily  Ah how happy you are my pretty little miss not to want help from any body and even to be able to help others  Marc  Are you very poor then my little girl  Emily  One must needs be poor that comes here gleaning with so much trouble what is to make a little bread  Harriet  What is it for bread that you come gathering the ears of corn I thought that you intended to toast the grains on a hot sireshovel and so to eat them as my brother and I do sometimes when no body sees us  Emily  O dear no My mother and I intended to beat the corn out of those ears and to give it to the miller that we might have flour to make bread  Harriet  But my poor child you could not have much out of that and it would not last you very long  Emily  Why suppose we had only enough for a day or two my mother and I should have a day or two the more to live  Marc  Well that you may have another day certain I will give you this shilling which I have kept the last of all my money because it is quite new  Emily  Ah my good little master So much money No no I dare not take it  Harriet    smiling    So much money Take it never fear If I had my purse about me I would give you much more but I keep it for you and you shall not be a loser  Marcellus    still holding out the money    Come take it    Emily  receives the money and curtsies to him without speaking    Marc  This is doing only half I will run as fast as I can after our bailiff and make him give me back the basket or else  Emily  Oh sir do not give yourself that trouble You have promised to assist me that is enough for me  Harriet  Tell me where do you live  Emily  Just by in the village  Marc  We never saw you before and yet we come here along with papa every year about harvesttime  Emily  We have been here only a week and live with a  old woman called Margaret who has shewed much friendship to my mother Oh a great deal of friendship indeed  Harriet  What old Margaret  Marc  Why we know her She is the widow of a poor weaver who was out of work My papa makes her come sometimes to weed in the garden  Harriet  Will you take me to your mother's  Emily  It would be too great an honour for her A young lady of quality like you  Harriet  No no our papa will not let us think ourselves to be any better than other people and if you have no other reason  Emily  None at all so far from it you may help me to comsort her for the loss of my basket and my corn And then that naughty man that threatened us  Marc  Fear none of his threats While my sister is going with you to your mother's I will run after him and I thinkYou will come back here again  Emily  If you chuse it my good young master  Marc  Your basket shall be here before you return  Emily  Perhaps I shall bring my mother with me to thank you  Harriet  Come along let us hasten to find her    Takes Emily by the hand and goes out with her    SCENE V  Marcellus alone  How happy are my sister and I not to be obliged like this poor child to go about picking up ears of corn for our food Really this little girl speaks as if she were born to something better She has not that dirty vulgar appearance of other cottage girls Oh certainly papa will oblige me so farBut here he comes along with Hardy That is clever here comes the basket too  SCENE VI  Marcellus Lord Bevil and Hardy  Marc    running up to his father    Ah dear papa how glad I am to meet you    To Hardy    Give me this basket  Hardy  Softly softly sir You will pull my arm off  Lord Bevil  What do you want with that basket Marcellus  Marc  It belongs to a poor little girl from whom this wicked Hardy took it as well as the ears of corn that had been given her You shall hear the whole papa  Hardy  So so one is wicked then for doing one's duty and for not assisting rogues in their dishonesty Why does my lord give me wages  Lord Bevil  I have often told you Hardy it is for hindering vagrants from haunting my grounds and incommoding my labourers but not for seizing poor people and dragging them to prison far less if they be honest persons reduced by necessity to seek a mite of nourishment from my superfluity and who meddle with nothing but a few ears of corn that lie scattered after a rich harvest  Hardy  In the first place I do not hinder them to glean as much as they will after the corn is in but while there is one sheaf on the ground  Marc    ironically    Why do not you say too after the fields are fallow or covered with snow There is a great deal to pick up indeed after the harvest is got home  Hardy  You do not understand these affairs master In the next place who can answer to us that these are not thieves  Marc  Thieves bless me thieves The little girl told me that she had not taken a single ear of corn here and that it was an old reaper in the next field who filled her basket for her  Hardy  That is good she told you as if there was a word of truth in what those gentry say I caught her here close by a sheaf  Lord Bevil  Pulling out the ears of corn  Hardy  I won't say so much as that But how do I know what she had been doing before I came up And then is not all that story false of an old reaper who filled her basket for her Oh it is very like the country people here those folks are so charitable  Marc  Now I'll maintain that those ears of corn were given her for she told me so and so good a little girl I am sure would not tell a story  Hardy  And pray master have you never told a story yet we all look upon you to be an excellent young gentleman  Marc  Do you hear papa how this fellow Hardy treats me    to Hardy angrily    No if I told stories I should be a wicked boy but I do not nor this good little girl neither And it is you that are a  Lord Bevil  Softly Marcellus I am thus far satisfied with your defence We should believe all men honest until we are convinced of the contrary But we should never be in a passion with those who are of a different opinion we should rather endeavour to bring them by gentleness to a more satisfactory and just way of thinking  Hardy  No no my Lord it is much better to believe all men wicked until we see beyond a possibility of doubting that they are honest that is much the wifest maxim Whenever I meet an ox in my road I always suppose him to be mischievous and get out of his way It may happen that he is not dangerous but I run no risque in being cautious The surest way is always the best  Lord Bevil  If all men had your manner of thinking with whom could we live And what dealings could ever have subsisted between you and me if instead of putting you into an honest service upon my estate in order to at  ord  a livelihood to a disbanded old soldier I had given you up to the magistrate as a vagrant having neither discharge nor certificate  Hardy  Yes that is very true but it is also true that I am an honest man  Lord Bevil  I do not keep you in my service but because I am persuaded of that but I had no foundation for believing it at first except your word and your countenance  Marc  My dear papa if you depend upon one's word and countenance you will much sooner believe our little girl than Hardy  Hardy  Ay Master look at my face Your papa will certainly be well satisfied with the countenance of your little girl if it conveys so favourable an impression as mine does  Marc  Oh yes it becomes you very well with that bear's face to  Lord Bevil  Fie MarcellusHardy do you know this little girl  Hardy  Yes my Lord I know her and I do not know her I know that she has been here about ten days with her mother but how or why they came here the overseers can best inform you And to speak my mind freely it is ill done of them to receive such folks into the parish to increase the expence of the poor's rate  Marc  Well then I'll take that expence upon me yes I  Hardy  Why have you any thing of your own Sir  Marc  If I have nothing my papa has enough  Hardy  In the mean time all the parish murmurs but when once you grease the fist of people in office    i  itates the action of counting money    for I am pretty sure the overseers  Marc  Look ye there if he is not speaking ill of the overseers it would be well done to tell them  Lord Bevil  Softly child I see Hardy it is impossible to cure your suspicious temper so that I am inclined to suspect too in my turn You judge that this little girl has filled her basket here because you found her in my field near a sheat You judge that the overseers would receive a bribe because they have admitted a poor family into the village Well then I judge that you  only kept this child's basket because she had no money or tobacco to give you and that in such case you would have freely released her  Hardy  How my Lord can you imagine  Lord Bevil  Why may not I think of you as you allow yourself to think of others  Hardy  Well my Lord I had better hold my tongue And were I to see those beggars carry away your fields your groves and your meadowsShall I take this basket to the steward  Marc  Oh no no dear papa I beg it as a favour  Lord Bevil  Hardy you will carry it to the poor woman's house and make an apology to the little girl  Hardy  An apology my Lord an apology can you thi  k of such a thing I go and make her an apology for what  Marc  For what  for having given her so much uneasiness without cause and for having affronted her by accusing her of a base action  Hardy  If they have not an apology nor basket until I  Lord Bevil  Hardy if I had been guilty of injustice to you I should never hesitate to make amends And to convince you of it I will go myself I will carry back the basket and make an apology in your name  Hardy  Or rather do you Master Marcellus take that charge upon you  Marc  Oh with all my heart Papa the little girl is to come back presently with Harriet who is gone to comsort her mother I must wait for her  Hardy  In that case I have no business here    He goes off muttering    I see we shall have so many beggars in this village that we must soon go begging ourselves  SCENE VII  Lord Bevil Marcellus  Marc  Papa do you hear what he says  Lord Bevil  Yes my dear I am willing to excuse his  ours  Marc  But how can you keep so illnatured a man  Lord Bevil  He is not illnatured my dear but his overmuch zeal to serve us leads him astray He is most faithfully attached to me and fulfils his duty punctually  Marc  But then if he is unjust  Lord Bevil  You heard him say that he did not think he was His only fault is that he follows his orders too literally and that he has not discernment enough to make the proper distinctions between persons and circumstances  Marc  Pray papa explain that to me  Lord Bevil  With pleasure my dear When I fixed him in his employment I gave him in charge to rid my grounds of vagrants and to carry all such when found upon them before a justice This order could only regard those wretches who live by thefts and robberies or should come to defraud or molest my tenants  Marc  Ah I understand Whereas he looks upon all those as rogues who subsist upon the charity of others and never informs himself whether old age sickness or inevitable misfortunes have reduced them to that condition  Lord Bevil  Very right my dear boy for circumstances alter things exceedingly For instance you did not shew sufficient reflexion in your dispute with him Can you tell whether the mother of this little girl is not a dishonest person whether the little girl herself has not told you an untruth and actually stolen those ears of corn out of my sheaves  Marc  No my dear papa that is impossible  Lord Bevil  Why impossible are you clearly informed of every thing Do you know who she is who her mother is and with what view they have come here  Marc  Ah if you had only seen her if you had only heard her speak her language her countenance her tears Then she is so poor as to have occasion for a handful of cornears to make her bread Need one know more than this Should I let a poor person perish with hunger because I do not know as yet whether he merits my assistance  Lord Bevil  Let me kiss thee my dear boy Preserve always these generous dispositions towards the poor and God will bless thee as he has blest me for the same sentiments by giving birth to them in thy young heart Mercy is always preferable to severity A want of feeling can only lead to injustice and if he who solicits our compassion does not merit it the fault is his not ours  Marc  But my dear papa it is not prudent to commit to such men a Hardy an office which puts it in one's power to be unjust  Lord Bevil  You would be right my son if I had left to him alone the power of condemning or acquitting He can at most commit but a slight injury which it is easy to remedy and this inconvenience is unavoidable To judge of things according to the principles of equity I have in my steward a man of good understanding upright and noble in his sentiments He gave me a favourable account of the little girl and her mother as soon as they were first received into the village and informed me that they live with old Margaret who is a very honest woman  Marc  But what if Hardy had beat the little girl as he threatened her  Lord Bevil  Nothing could have carried him so far I have forbidden him on pain of losing his place to strike any person whatsoever even those whom he should surprise in doing any thing amiss and he rigorously pursues the orders that I give him  Marc  Ah papa here is my sister returning with the little girl  SCENE VIII  Lord Bevil Marcellus Harriet Emily  Marc    running with the basket to Emily    Here my little girl here is your basket There has not been a single ear of it touched  Emily  O my dear basket how much am I obliged to you my good little master    perceiving Lord Bevil    Who is that gentleman  Harriet    running towards her father and jumping up to embrace him    This is our good papa  Marc  Oh he is a good papa indeed that I can assure you so that you have nothing to fear Come I'll introduce you to him    Coming forward    He has scolded old Hardy well for treating you as he did  Emily    advances fearfully towards Lord Bevil and curtsies to him    I beg pardon my Lord for the libertybut your Lordship's children are so good  Lord Bevil    aside    Marcellus was right Whoever looks on her cannot doubt her innocence That graceful air her manner of speaking are proofs of no vulgar education  Emily    in a low voice to Marcellus and Harriet    Have I made your papa angry He is talking to himself  Lord Bevil    overhearing her    No my dear If my children have behaved well to you they have done no more than you appear to merit  Harriet  Nor than she does really merit papa Ah if you had seen her mother  Lord Bevil  Who is your mother my dear By what means did you come to these parts and how do you live  Emily  We liveindeed I can scarce tell how We live upon little or nothing We spend the day and sometimes the night in spinning and working at the needle to get us bread Old Madge affords my mother lodging and they sent me today into the fields to glean but indeed my first attempt has not turned out well  Marc    in a whisper to Emily    Better than you think my sister will get papa's leave that you shall have ears of corn without gleaning  Lord Bevil  But where did you live before  Emily  At Richmond which is a few miles off Living was too dear there So old Margaret persuaded my mother to come to her and offered her houseroom for nothing  Lord Bevil    aside    If people who are so poor exercise humanity to each other what duties have not we to fulfil    to Emily    Is your father living what is his profession  Marc  I will lay a wager he is no working man  Harriet  And so will I especially since I have seen her mother  Emily    confused    My fatherI have none Indeed I never saw him He died before I was born Ah if he was living now  Lord Bevil  And do not you know who he was What was his name  Emily  My mother will inform you better than I  Lord Bevil  Could I speak with her  Harriet  Oh yes papa she is coming herself She only begged a moment's time to put herself in order  Lord Bevil  And who brought you up  Emily  My mother entirely my lord She taught me to read and write She instructs me in my religion and gives me some lessons in drawing  Lord Bevil  In drawing I have not a doubt remaining This is a branch of some good family reduced by misfortunes to necessity  Harriet  Ah here she comes  Marc  Is this she  Lord Bevil    aside    I am impatient to clear up this mystery This child recalls to my mind features that are well known to me but whose I cannot recollect  SCENE IX  Lord Bevil Mrs Jennings Marcellus Harriet Emily  Emily    running to meet her mother who appears confused on seeing Lord Bevil    Come mama do not be afraid this is the papa of those two amiable children that shewed us so much goodnature and he is very kind too as kind as his children    Mrs Jennings advances modestly Harriet eagerly takes her hand and draws her on towards her father    Harriet  Oh my papa knows all  Mrs Jenn  May I flatter myself that your lordship has not suspected my little Emily  Lord Bevil  The sight alone madam of you and your daughter is sufficient to convey the most favourable opinion of you both  Marc  Is her name Emily Oh papa it is easy to see that she was not born to be a gleaner  Mrs Jenn  The laws of necessity are sometimes severe and as long as we do nothing dishonourable  Lord Bevil  Nobody should blush for poverty it may be found united to every virtue But may I take the liberty madam to ask your name  Harriet  Her name is Mrs Lambert  Mrs Jenn  I should not disguise my real name from your lordship I find myself indeed under the necessity of disclosing it to you in order to justify myself in  your lordship's opinion for the state to which you see me reduced Yet I should wish    looking at the children    to make this avowal to you without witnesses not that I blush for my humble situation but if my name was known I should fear to meet among the lower class some ungenerous souls who would perhaps take a pleasure in mortifying me because they sometimes see those who are in prosperity behave with the same want of generosity to themselves  Marc  Well I shall not listen  Harriet  And I will never mention a word of it I assure you Whoever you are Emily shall always be my friend  Lord B  Be assured Madam I should not enquire these particulars without being strongly interested in them and unless I were resolved to make amends for the injustice of fortune  Mrs Jenn  I was born of a good family though little favoured by fortune I passed my youth in London as companion to a Lady of the first rank Eight years ago I became acquainted with Mr Jennings a lieutenantcolonel in the army who had come to spend some months in town  Lord B    eagerly    Jennings Jennings  Mrs Jenn  He conceived an affection for me and his good qualities prejudiced me in his favour I gave him my hand and a few days after our marriage we retired to a small estate which he had in Dorsetshire  Lord B  'Tis the same 'tis the same I can trace his features in the face of this child  Mrs Jenn  How my Lord  Lord B  Go on Madam I conjure you  Mrs Jenn  I will be as brief as possble We were beginning to enjoy in a peaceful retirement the happiness of a most tender union But alas the fatigues of the service had impaired my husband's health and a severe illness seizing him put an end to his life in a few days    weeps    Harriet    to Emily    Poor child you became an orphan very soon  Emily  Ah me before I was even born  Mrs Jenn  He left me pregnant of this child whom you see She was born in sorrow As soon as my husband's  brothers who were hardhearted worldly men saw that there was no male heir they took possession of his property and as we had delayed from day to day the formal atte  tions requisite to put our marriage articles in force I was obliged to be satisfied with whatever they thought proper to allow for the subsistence of me and my daughter  Lord B  Their ungenerous avarice gives room to suppose that the sum was small and could not last you long  Mrs Jenn  It sufficed to maintain me for a few years in Dorsetshire during which time I continued to flatter myself with the expectation of obtaining a small jointure But at length seeing all my hopes frustrated I took the resolution of returning to London to my former benefactress On my arrival I learned that she had died a short time before Having then no other resource than to fell what remained of my clothes and jewels and to work with my own hands for a subsistence I retired to Richmond to live private and unknown And there I met some time ago a woman whom I had formerly known and who lives in this village  Harriet  That is old Margaret papa  Mrs Jenn  She had been servant to the Lady whom I mentioned My attention to her during a severe illness attached her strongly to me I explained my situation to her and she proposed to me to come and live here where I might enjoy a still more obscure retreat I am indebted much to her hospitality and as she has no relation to perform the last offices for her she has given me to understand that I shall succeed to the possession of her little cottage You see my Lord  Lord B  'Tis enough Madam This generous woman shall not surpass me in gratitude It gives me inexpressible joy  t be able to repay a debt which I have contracted to your worthy husband  Mrs Jenn  How my Lord have you known my husband  Marc  The father of this good little Emily  Harriet  my dear Emily I see we shall keep you with us But what is the matter do you cry  Emily  It is only for joy  Lord B  To your husband I owe my life How happy am I then in being able to repay that kindness to his wife and his child I served under him last war In a  dangerous engagement one of the enemy's horsemen had his sword lifted over me at a time when I was quite spent with fatigue so that I must have perished if my brave lieutenantcolonel had not saved my life by rushing upon him at the very moment  Mrs Jenn  I know him well by this description He was as brave as he was generous  Lord B  Some days after I was sent with a detachment upon a very dangerous expedition We were surrounded and forced to yield after a long resistance My baggage had been plundered so that I was stript of both clothes and money Colonel Jennings being informed of my situation procured me a recommendation to the enemy's general Through his exertions I obtained every assistance requisite whilst under cure for a deep wound that I received I was more than two years in recovering and when we were ordered home had barely time to pay him a visit of acknowledgment before I was obliged to go on board immediately for the WestIndies I married there to my advantage and in consequence of that circumstance returned to England about six years ago I was preparing to fly to him when I heard that he was no more I little thought that his wife and daughter experienced that reverse of fortune in which I am grieved to find you at present  Mrs Jenn  Good God by what wonderful ways hast thou conducted me hither  Marc  What your father saved papa's life  Harriet  How dearly we ought to love you  Lord B  Come hither Emily thou shalt find in me the father whom thou hast lost My children too have occasion for a second mother to replace her whom death has taken from them The education that you have given your amiable child    Emily goes close up to him and takes his hand    shews me Madam how worthy you are to fill so delicate an employ I shall take every necessary precaution that you may not have to dread a second time the unforeseen strokes of adversity    To Emily who still holds his hand    Yes my little dear I will make no difference between you and my own children You are the living image of your generous father and are as worthy of my affection as he was of my gratitude  Mrs Jenn    with emotion    How shall I answer my Lord to so much kindness I have only tears to express what I feel  Harriet    embracing her    My dear new mama will you always be with us then as well as Emily You shall see how glad we will be to obey you  Marc  Yes and Emily shall be my other sister She will certainly not go any more to glean Ah illnatured Hardy how I shall laugh at you now  Mrs Jenn  My dear little lambs with what joy you fill my heart Instead of one child then I have now three and no mother shall equal me in attention and tenderness to them    to Lord Bevil    Will your Lordship permit me to go and impart these happy tidings to my good friend Margaret I almost fear that she will die with joy  Lord B  Nothing is more just Madam meantime I will go and order an apartment to be prepared for you at my house  Harriet  Papa will you give me leave to go with Emily and my new mama  Marc  And me too papa I should wish to accompany them  Lord B  With pleasure my dear children Afterwards you will bring Mrs Jennings and her daughter to our house without forgetting good old Margaret whom I invite also to come and dine with us  Marc    to Emily who is going to take the basket    No Emily this is not fit for you to carry now Let the basket remain here  Emily  Oh Sir I would not give this basket for any thing in the world To it I owe my own happiness and my mother's the happiness of knowing you and in short my life and wellbeing No my dear little basket I shall never blush to carry you    She lifts it up with difficulty    Harriet  At least take the ears of corn out it will be lighter  Emily  No no They are mine For the good old reaper gave them to me whatever Hardy might say I will make a present of them to old Margaret  Lord B  She shall not be forgot next harvest and from this day forward shall be assured of bread for her whole life  Mrs Jenn  May heaven reward you in your children for these acts of generosity  CECILIA AND MARIAN  BEFORE the sun had risen above the horizon to enliven with his splendor one of the finest mornings of the spring young Cecilia went down into her father's garden to taste with more appetite as she roved through its walks the sweetness of a little cake of which she intended to make her breakfast  Every thing that could add to the beauties of the rising day united to charm her The pure breath of zephyr while it diffused a calm around refreshed every sense Her palate was feasted with sweets her eye with the lively freshness of the springing verdure her smell with the balmy perfume of a thousand flowers and that her ear alone might not be without its share of delight two nightingales perching near her on the top of a green arbour charmed her with their morning song Cecilia was so transported with all these delicious sensations that her fine eyes were bedewed with a moisture which however rested on her eyelids without dropping in tears Her heart felt a soft emotion and was impressed with feelings of tenderness and benevolence All at once this agreeable calm was interrupted by the sound of steps and a little girl came forward towards the same walk eating with great appetite a piece of coarse brown bread As she too came into the garden for amusement her eyes wandered from one object to another without being fixed on any so that she came close up to Cecilia before she perceived her On seeing who it was she stopped short a moment and looked down then like a young deer that is frightened and almost as swift as one she ran back again with all her speed Stop stop cried Cecilia wait for me why do you run away But these words made the little wild creature fly still faster Cecilia pursued  but as she was less used to running could not possibly come up with her Luckily the little stranger had turned up another walk and that in which Cecilia was led directly to the garden gate Cecilia as sensible as she was pretty slipped softly along by a close hedge that bordered the walk and reached the end of it just as the little girl was going to pass by She caught hold of her unawares crying Ah now you are my prisoner Oh I have you fa  you cannot escape now The little girl struggled to get out of her hands Do not be illnatured said Cecilia to her if you knew how well I mean to use you I am sure you would not be so shy Come my good child come along with me for a moment These friendly words and still more the gentle tone of voice with which they were pronounced encouraged the little stranger and she followed Cecilia into a summerhouse that was near  Is your father alive said Cecilia making her sit down beside her  Marian  Yes Miss  Cec  And what does he follow  Marian  Any trade at all to earn his bread He came to day to work in your garden and has brought me with him  Cec  Oh I see him down there upon the lettuce bed It is fat Thomas But what are you eating for your breakfast Let me see I want to taste your bread Oh dear how it scrapes my throat Why does not your father give you better than this  Marian  Because he has not so much money as your papa  Cec  But then he earns some by his work and he could afford you houshold bread or else something along with this to make it palatable  Marian  Yes if I was his only child but there are five of us and we all eat heartily and then one wants a frock and another a jacket and that makes my father quite at a less what to do Sometimes he says 'tis all in vain for me to work I shall never earn enough to feed and clothe this young fry  Cec  Then you never eat any plum cake  Marian  Plum cake what is that  Cec  See here is some in my hand  Marian  La I never saw any before in my life  Cec  Taste a little of it Don't be afraid You see I eat it  Marian    joyfully    Oh dear Mis how good it is  Cec  I believe so My good girl what is your name  Marian    rising and making her a low curtsey    Marian Miss at your service  Cec  Well my good Marian stop here for me a moment I am going to ask something from my governess for you and will return immediately But don't you go away  Marian  Oh no I am not afraid of you now  Cecilia ran to her governess and begged her to give her some currant jelly for a little girl who had nothing but dry bread for breakfast The governess was pleased with the goodnature of her amiable pupil She gave her some in a cup and a small roll at the same time and Cecilia ran with all her speed to carry Marian this breakfast Well said she as she came up have I made you wait long Here my good child take this lay down your brown bread you will eat enough of that another time  Marian    tasting the jelly and licking her lips    It is like sugar I never tasted any thing so sweet  Cecilia  I am glad that you like it I was pretty sure it would please you  Marian  What do you eat such as this every day Ah we poor people do not know what it is to taste it  Cec  I am sorry for that Hark ye come to see me now and then I will always give you some But bless me how healthy you look Are you never sick  Marian  Sick what I no never  Cec  Do you never catch cold or feel your head stuffed  Marian  What sickness is that  Cec  When one is always coughing and blowing one's nose  Marian  Oh yes that happens to me sometimes but it is not a sickness  Cec  And do they make you keep your bed then  Marian  Ha ha my mother I dare say would make a fine noise if I were to take it in my head to be lazy  Cec  Why what work can you do You are so little  Marian  Must not I go in the winter to get straw for our cow and dry sticks to make the pot boil and in summer must I not go to weed the corn and in harvest time to glean and pull hops Ah Miss we are never at a loss for work  Cec  And are your sisters too as healthy as you  Marian  Oh we are all hearty and as full of play as little mice  Cec  Well now I am glad of that I was at first afraid that God took no care of so many poor children but since you have your health I see that he has not forgotten you I am very well too in health though certainly not so strong as you but child you go barefoot why do not you wear shoes and stockings  Marian  Because it would cost my father too much money if he was to give them to us all so he gives none of us any  Cec  And are not you afraid of hurting yourself  Marian  I never once mind it God almighty made the soles of my feet hard like shoes  Cec  I should not like to lend you mine but how comes it that you have left off eating  Marian  The time has past away in talk I must now go and gather some greens for our cow It will soon be eight o'clock and she waits for her breakfast  Cec  Well take the rest of your roll with you stop a moment I will take out the crumb and you shall put the jelly into the hollow of the crust  Marian  I will carry it to my youngest sister Oh she will not be nice about it she won't leave the least crumb when once she tastes it  Cec  Now I love you better than ever for thinking of your little sister  Marian  I never get any thing good but I give her part Good bye miss  Cec  Good bye Marian but remember to come here tomorrow at the same hour  Marian  If my mother does not send me somewhere else I'll warrant I shall not fail  Cecilia had now tasted the happiness of doing good She walked a little longer in the garden thinking how happy she had made Marian how grateful Marian had shewed herself and how pleased her little sister would be  to taste currant jelly What will it be said she when I give her some ribbands and a necklace Mama gave me some the other day that were pretty enough but I am tired of them now Then I'll look in my drawers for some old things to give her We are just of a size and my slips would fit her charmingly Oh how I long to see her well drest  Next morning Marian slipped into the garden again Cecilia gave her some gingerbread that she had bought for her Marian did not fail to come every day and Cecilia thought of nothing but new dainties to give her When her pocketmoney was out she begged her mama to order her something out of the pantry and her mother consented with pleasure It happened however one day that Cecilia received an answer which grieved her She was entreating her mother to advance her a little of her weekly allowance to buy shoes and stockings for Marian that she might not go barefoot No my dear Cecilia answered her mother And why mama I will tell you at dinner my reasons for wishing that you would be a little more sparing towards your favourite Cecilia was surprized at this refusal She never longed so much for dinnertime as that day At length they sat down to table Dinner was half over before her mother spoke a word concerning Marian At length however a dish of shrimps that was served up furnished Mrs Allen with an opportunity of beginning the conversation thus  Mrs A  Ah here is my Cecilia's favourite dish is it not I am glad they have brought some up today  Cec  Yes mama I like shrimps very well and at this season they are good  Mrs A  I dare say that Marian would like them still better than you do  Cec  Ah my poor Marian I suppose she has never seen any If she was only to look at these long whiskers she would be frightened oh  so  frightened I think I see her running away with all her speed Mama if you will give me leave I should be curious to see how she would look There I will take only two for her two of the smallest  Mrs A  I am almost unwilling to consent to your request  Cec  Why so mama You that do good to every body I asked you this morning too for a little money to buy shoes and stockings for Marian and you refused me Marian surely must have vexed you Has she done any m  schief in the garden oh I shall be sure to scold her  Mrs A  No my dear Cecilia Marian has not displeased me But do you wish by your kindness to her to make her happy or unhappy  Cec  Happy mama God forbid that I should wish the contrary  Mrs A  I could wish too with all my heart to see her more fortunate since she has gained your esteem But is it true Cecilia that she eats her bread quite dry for breakfast  Cec  It is very true mama I would not deceive you  Mrs A  How and has she been content with it till now  Cec  O dear yes and I never eat a tart with more pleasure than she ea  her brown bread  Mrs A  Then I should think she has a good appetite But I can hardly imagine that she goes barefoot  Cec  I have always seen her barefoot Ask the gardener else  Mrs A  Then she makes them all over blood when she walks on the gr  vel or pebb  es  Cec  Not at all She runs about in the garden like a little  eer and she says langhing that God almighty has made the  les of her feet hard like a pair of shoes  Mrs A  I know that you never tell stories but I confess that I can hardly believe what you say now I should be glad to see the wry faces that my Cecilia would make in eating her bread quite dry without butter or sweetmeats  Cec  Oh I know it would stick in my throat  Mrs A  Nor should I be less curious to see how she would set about walking b  efoot  Cec  Well then mama do not be angry but yesterday I had a mind to try Being all alone in the garden I took off my shoes and stockings to walk barefoot I felt my feet sadly hurt but still I walked on At last I struck against a stone Oh that did so pain me that I went back as softly as I could and put on my shoes and  stockings and I promised fairly never to walk barefoot again My poor Marian yet she is so all the summer  Mrs A  But how comes it then that you cannot eat dry bread nor walk barefoot as she does  Cec  The thing is perhaps that I am not used to it  Mrs A  Why then if she uses herself like you to eat sweet things and to wear shoes and stockings and afterwards if the brown bread should go against her and she should not be able to walk barefoot do you think that you would have done her any great service  Cec  No mama but I mean that she shall never be obliged to do so again all her lifetime  Mrs A  A very generous design and will your pocketmoney be sufficient for that  Cec  Oh yes mama if you will only add ever so little to it  Mrs A  You know that my heart is never against helping the distrest whenever an occasion offers But is Marian the only child that you know in necessity  Cec  Nay I know many others beside There are two especially just by in the village that have neither father nor mother  Mrs A  And they without doubt stand much in need of assistance  Cec  Oh they do indeed mama  Mrs A  But if you give Marian every thing if you feed her with biscuits and sweetmeats while you let the rest die with hunger will there be much justice and humanity in that management  Cec  But now and then I shall be able to give them something Yet after all I love Marian best  Mrs A  If you were to die and Marian had been used to enjoy every indulgence  Cec  I am pretty sure that she would cry for my death  Mrs A  Yes I am convinced of that But then would she fall into indigence again and perhaps be obliged to do some disgraceful action in order to live well and dress well as before Who would then have the blame of her ruin  Cec    sorrowfully    I should mama So then I must never give her any thing again  Mrs A  I do not think so however I should imagine that you will do well to give her sweet things seldomer and to make her a present rather of a good coat  Cec  Why I was thinking of it I will give her if you please one of my frocks  Mrs A  I suppose your muslin slip would become her surprizingly especially without shoes or stockings  Cec  Oh every body would point at her How shall we do then  Mrs A  If I were in your place I would be sparing in my amusements for some time and when I had saved a little money would lay it out in buying whatever was most necessary for her The stuff that poor children wear is not very expensive  Cecilia followed her mother's advice Marian came feldomer indeed to see her about breakfast time but Cecilia made her other presents that were more useful At one time she would give her an apron another time a petti  and she paid the schoolmaster of the village so much a month for her schooling that she might improve herself perfectly in reading Marian was so sensible of these kindnesses that she grew every day more tenderly attached to Cecilia She came frequently to see  er and would say to her Have you any commands for me  Is there any work that I can do for you And whenever Cecilia gave her an opportunity of doing any slight service it was pleasing to see with what joy Marian  erted herself to oblige her One day she came to the garden gate to wait for Cecilia's coming down but Cecilia did not come Marian came back again but could not see Cecilia She returned two days successively but no Cecilia appeared Poor Marian was disconsolate not finding her benefactress Ah said she can it be that she does not love me I have perhaps vexed her without meaning it I am sure if I knew in what I would ask her pardon for I could not live without loving her Just then Mrs Allen's maid came out Marian stopped her Where is Miss Cecilia asked she Miss Cecilia replied the woman She has perhaps not long to live I am afraid that she is in her last moments She has the smallpox O dear heart cried Marian I won't let her die and running to the stairs she flies up into Mrs Allen's chamber Madam said she for God's sake tell  me where is Miss Cecilia I must see her Mrs Allen would have stopped Marian but the door being half open she had a sight of Cecilia's bed and was already by her side Cecilia was in a violent fever alone and very low in spirits for all her little acquaintances had forsaken her Marian drowned in tears took her hand squeezed it in hers and kissed it saying Ah is it thus I find you Do not die I pray you what would become of me were I to lose you I will stay with you night and day I will watch over you and serve you will you allow me Cecilia squeezing her hand signified to her that she would do her a pleasure in staying constantly with her Marian was now become with the consent of Mrs Allen Cecilia's nurse and performed this part to admiration She had a small bed made up for her close beside her little sick friend and never left her a moment On the slightest expression of pain from Cecilia Marian rose immediately to know what she wanted She gave her with her own hands the medicines ordered her by the physicians Sometimes she would go and gather bulrushes to amuse her by making handsome little rush baskets while she looked on Sometimes she would tumble all Mrs Allen's library over to find pictures for her in the books She exerted her imagination in search of every thing that was capable of diverting Cecilia from the sense of her illness Cecilia had her eyes closed by the disorder for near a week This time appeared to her very tedious but Marian told her stories of what happened in the village and as she had profited well by her lessons at school read to her whatever she thought would give her pleasure Now and then too she addressed her with the most sensible consolations With a little patience she would say God almighty will have pity upon you as you have had pity on me At these words she would weep then quickly drying her eyes Will you let me sing you a pretty song to divert you Cecilia had only to make a sign and Marian would sing her all the songs that she had learned from the young country maids round about Thus the time passed over without hanging heavy on Cecilia At length by degrees her health was reestablished she could open her eyes again her lowness of spirits left her the pock dried up and her appetite returned Her face was  still covered with red spots Marian seemed to look at her with more pleasure than ever while she thought how narrowly she had missed losing her Cecilia on the other hand regarded her with equal tenderness How shall I be able to pay you she would say to my satisfaction for all that you have done for me She asked her mama in what manner she might recompense her tender and faithful nurse Mrs Allen who was almost beside herself with joy to see her dear child restored to health after so dangerous an illness answered her Leave it to me I shall take the charge of acquitting both your obligations and mine to her She gave private orders to have a complete suit of clothes made for Marian and Cecilia undertook to try it on her the first day that she should be allowed to go down into the garden It was a day of rejoicing through the whole house Mrs Allen and all her family were transported with gladness at the recovery of Cecilia Cecilia was delighted that she had it in her power to recompense Marian and Marian was out of her wits with joy to behold Cecilia once more in the same spot where their acquaintance had commenced and besides to find herself new clad from head to foot  LITTLE JACK  MR Churchill was returning home one day on horseback after taking a ride about his own estate As he passed by the wall of a buryingground belonging to a small village he heard the groans of a person on the other side This worthy gentleman had a heart too full of compassion to hesitate in flying to the relief of the unfortunate person whom he heard groan He alighted and giving his horse to the servant who followed him sprung over the enclosure of the buryingground He stood on tiptoe and looking all round at length perceived in a corner at the farthest end a grave covered with earth that was still quite fresh Upon this grave lay at his full length a child about five years old who was weeping Mr Churchill approached him with looks  of kindness and said to him What dost thou do there my little friend  Child  I am calling my mother They laid her here yesterday and she does not get up  Mr Ch  That is because she is dead my poor child  Child  Yes they say that she is dead but I cannot believe it She was so well the other day when she lest me with old Susan our neighbour she told me she was to come back but she does not come My father is gone away too and my little brother and now the other little boys of the town won't have me  Mr Ch  Won't have you why so  Child  I do not know but when I want to go along with them they drive me away and leave me by myself And they say naughty things too about my father and mother That is what vexes me most of all O mammy get up get up  Mr Churchill's eyes filled with tears You say that your father is gone away and your brother too where are they gone  Child  I do not know where my father is and my little brother went away yesterday to another town There came a gentleman all in black just like our parson and took him away  Mr Ch  And where do you live now  Child  With our neighbour Susan I am to be there until my mother comes back as she promised me I love my other mammy Susan very well but    pointing to the grave    I love my mammy that is here a great deal better O mother mother why do you lie so long when will you get up  Mr Ch  My poor child you call her in vain for you will never awake her  Child  Well then I will lie down here and sleep by her Ah I saw her when they put her into a great chest to carry her away Oh how white she was and how cold I will lie down here and sleep by her  Mr Churchill could no longer refrain from tears He stooped down took the child up in his arms and kissing him tenderly said What is your name my poor little fellow  Child  They call me Jackey when I am good and when I am a bad boy they call me you Jack  Mr Churchill though in tears smiled at this answer Will you take me to Susan Oh yes yes Sir answered the child and running before Mr Churchill as fast as his little legs could go conducted him to Susan's door Susan was not a little surprized on seeing a gentleman enter her cottage with little Jack who pointing to her and running to hide his face in her lap said That is she that is my other mammy She knew not what to think of so extraordinary a visit Mr Churchill however did not leave her long in suspence He expressed to her the situation in which he had found the child and the compassion that he felt for him and at the same time requested her to favour him with every information concerning the parents of little Jack Susan bade him be seated and placing herself close by him began thus The father of this child is a shoemaker whose house joins mine He is an honest sober laborious man under thirty and a comely person His wife was a handsome woman but did not get her health well Withal she was very careful and a good housewise They were married about seven years ago lived vastly well together and would have made the happiest couple in the world if they had been a little better in their affairs John had nothing but his trade and Margaret being left an orphan brought her husband only a little money that she had sav  in the service of a worthy clergyman the curate of the next parish This little sum was laid out in buying a bed and a few other articles of houshold furniture with a small stock of leather for his work In spite of their poverty they contrived to maintain themselves during the first years of their marriage by dint of labour and good management But children came on and then began their difficulties Yet still they might have made it out by doubling their industry if misfortunes had not happened to them Poor Margaret who had worked in the fields every day during the hay time to bring home some money at night to her husband fell sick of fatigue and continued so all the harvest and all winter Physick is very expensive and then besides the work did not go on so well because John's customers left him one by one as they were afraid of being ill served in a house where there was a sick wife At last Margaret grew better but her husband's business declined He was obliged  to borrow money to pay the apothecary and having lost all his customers he was now quite out of work At the same time Margaret could earn nothing her strength was so much reduced that nobody would give her employment Besides the rent of their house and the interest of the money that they had borrowed came heavily upon them They were obliged more than once to suffer hunger and thought themselves very happy when they had a morsel of bread to give to their children At these words little Jack withdrew into a corner and began to sob With all this it happened that their hardhearted landlord seeing them not able to pay the rent of the two winter quarters threatened John to put him in ga  They begged hard of him to have patience until the hay  making came on because then they could earn something by working in the fields but neither their entr  nor their tears could soften him though he is the richest man in the place It was with much ado that he allowed them a month's delay but he swore that if at the end of that time he was not paid the whole he would sell their furniture and put John in prison Their house was now a  cture of melancholy and patient distress capable of  oftening a heart of stone You may believe me Sir I have often been grieved to the soul on hearing the complaints of these good neighbours and not being able to relieve them I went once myself to their landlord and prayed him to have compassion on their extremity I offered to pawn to him all that I possessed in the world But it was to no purpose You are no better than they are answered he this it is to have such trash of tenants as you are all together Ah Sir    here the tears trickled down Susan's checks    I bore this reproach patiently that I might not provoke him still more but oh how I suffered in being no more than a poor widow and in not being able to afford the least comfort to those worthy people How much good the rich might do if they had the same inclination as the poor But to return to our unfortunate neighbours I advised Margaret to make known her distresses to the clergyman with whom she had lived some years as an honest and worthy servant and to beg of him to advance her some money She answered me that she would speak about it to her husband but that she could hardly think of doing so  because the carate might imagine that they were reduced to want through their own bad management Three days ago she brought me her two children as she used to do and begged me to take care of them till the evening She intended to go to a neighbouring village and try if she could have some hemp from the weaver to spin in order to clear her debt She could never bring herself to go before the clergyman her old master but her husband was to go in her stead and he had set off the same day I took charge of the children with pleasure for I loved them very well having been at the birth of them Margaret as she was going clasped them to her breast and kissed them as if it were the last time that eyer she should see them Her eyes were swimming in tears and she said to the eldest Jackey I am to be back very soon and then I'll come and setch you She took me by the hand thanked me for being so good as to look after her children kissed them once more and departed A little time after I heard an odd sort of noise in her house that went thump as it were but imagining that she was gone out I supposed it might be only the inner door clapping to and so did not think any more about it Well the evening came on it grew dark night and I saw nothing or my neighbour I thought I would go to her house and see it she was gone in to lay her hemp down before she came to fetch the children I found the door open and went in But O heavens how was I struck on beholding Margaret stretched at her length stone dead at the f  t of the stairs As for me I stood motionless and as cold as a stone I did not know what to do At length after trying in vain to recover her I ran to the surgeon who came and feeling her pulse shook his head and sent directly for the coroner They held an inquest the surgeon being present to examine how she came by her death and they brought it in that she must have died suddenly or that having fallen into a fit and not being able to call for help she expired in that condition I can easily imagine how it happened She had returned into her own house to go up to the lost for the bag that was to hold her hemp and as her eyes were still dimmed with tears she had missed her step in coming down and fallen from the top of the stairs with her head foremost on the ground The bag that was beside her shewed it  plainly Yet for all that the coroner thought otherwise So the body was ordered to be buried the next morning before daylight in a corner of the churchyard and an enquiry to be made after John to know what was become of him I proposed to the parish officers to keep the two children myself for though I find it hard enough to live yet thought I the bounteous God knows that I am a helpless widow and if these two children come to my charge will surely assist me to feed them The younger brother to this did not stay long with me Yesterday of all days and even not long after Margaret had been buried did the worthy curate her old master come by chance to see her He knocked for some time at her door and as nobody opened he came to my window and asked me what was become of John Johnson the shoemaker that lived in the next house I told him that if he would give himself the trouble to step in a moment I had many things to tell him He came in and sat down there just where you are I told him all that had happened which made him shed tears Afterwards I told him that John had some thoughts of applying to him in his distress He seemed surprized and assured me positively that he had not seen John The two children came up to him and he fondled them a good deal Little Jack asked him if he could not awake his mother who had been a long time asleep The tears came into the good curate's eyes when he heard the child talk so and he said to me Good woman I will send tomorrow for these two little boys and I will keep them at home with me If their father returns and should be able to bring them up I shall restore them to him whenever he requires it In the mean time I will take charge of their education All this was not very agreeable to me for I love these little innocents as if I were their mother and it would have given me some pain to see them snatched from me so soon Doctor said I to him I cannot consent to part with these children I am used to them and they are used to meWell then my good woman you must give me one of them and I will leave you the other since he is likely to be so happy with you and from time to time I shall send you something towards his maintenance I could not refuse the good parson this He asked little Jack if he should not like to go with him What there  where my mother is said Jack oh yes with all my heartNo my little man I do not mean there but to my handsome house and my handsome gardenNo no let me stay here with Susan I'll go every day to where my mother is I would rather go there than to your handsome garden The good gentleman did not chuse to trouble the child more who had gone to hide himself behind the curtains of my bed He told me that he would send his man for the youngest who would give me more trouble than the other and at his going left me some money for this child This Sir is all that I have to inform you of the parents of little Jack What doubles my uneasiness at present is that John does not return and that a report goes in the parish that he is gone to join a gang of smugglers and that his wife killed herself for grief These stories have gained such ground in the village that there is not one even to the children but talks of them and whenever my poor Jack would go amongst the other boys they drive him away and are ready to beat him The poor child is quite dull and never stirs out now unless to go to his mother's grave  Mr Churchill had listened in silence to Susan's account and was deeply affected by it Little Jack was come again close up to her He looked at her with fondness and called her several times his mother At length Mr Charchill said to Susan My worthy woman you have conducted yourself very generously towards this unfortunate family God will not fail to reward you for it  Susan  I have done no more than my duty We are sent into this world to assist and relieve each other I always thought that I could do nothing more pleasing in the sight of God for all the blessings that I have received from him than to comfort my poor neighbours to the utmost of my power Ah if I could have done more than I did But I am possessed of nothing in the world except my cottage a little garden where I have a few greens and what I can earn by the work of my hands Nevertheless for these eight years that I have been a widow God has always given me an honest support and I hope will do so while I live  Mr Ch  But if you keep this child the expence of maintaining him may be very inconvenient to you before he be capable of earning his bread  Susan  I shall always take care not to let him want We will share even to my last morsel of bread  Mr Ch  And how are you to furnish him with clothes  Susan  I leave the care of that to him who clothes the fields with grass and the trees with leaves He has given me fingers to sew and spin they shall work to clothe our poor little orphan Whosoever can pray and work will never want  Mr Ch  Then you are resolved to keep little Jack with yourself  Susan  Always Sir I could not live under the thought of sending away this destitute infant from me or of setting him come upon the parish  Mr Ch  You are I suppose related to his family  Susan  No otherwise than as neighbours and fellowchristians  Mr Ch  Then as I am also related to both of you by religion and humanity I will not suffer you alone to have all the honour of doing good to this orphan since God has provided me with the means for it more amply than you Commit the education of little Jack to my care and since you are so strongly attached to each other and that your benevolence merits my esteem as much as the child's affection for his mother I will take you both home with me and provide for you Sell your garden and your cottage and come live at my house there you shall have a comfortable support and a home for the rest of your life  Susan    looking at him affectionately    Do not be angry at me sir May God reward you for all your goodness but I cannot accept your offers  Mr Ch  And why  Susan  In the first place I am fond of the spot where I was born and have lived so long then again I could not suit myself to the bustle of a great house nor to the sight of so many folks in a family neither am I used to ease or nice living I should fall sick if I had nothing to do or if I eat finer food than ordinary Let me bide therefore in my cottage with my little Jack it will do him no harm to live a little hard Nevertheless if you chuse to send him now and then a small matter to pay for his schooling and to furnish him with tools for whatever trade he may take up the gracious God will not  to pay you an hundred fold at least this boy and I will  daily for you that he may I have no child he shall be instead of one to me and what little I possess shall belong to him whenever it pleases the Lord to call me to himself  Mr Ch  Well then be it so I do not wish that what I mean well should make you unhappy I will leave little Jack with you since you are so well together Talk to him often of me and tell him that I am in the place of a father to him while you on the other hand will take upon you the cares and the name of the mother for whom he grieves so much I shall send you every month what may be sufficient for your subsistence I will come frequently to see you and my visit shall be as much on your account as his  Susan lifted up her eyes to heaven and implored its favours on Mr Churchill She then said to the child Come hither Jackey and ask this gentleman's blessing he will be your father now The little boy did so but said presently to Susan How can he be my daddy he wears no apron Mr Churchill smiled at this innocent question of little Jack and throwing his purse on the table Farewel said he generous Susan farewel my little friend it shall not be long before you see me again He then left them and mounting his horse took the road that led to the parish where the Curate lived who had taken home the younger orphan He found the Curate reading a letter on which he now and then shed tears After the first civilities Mr Churchill explained the subject of his visit to the worthy divine and asked him if he knew what was become of the father of those two unfortunate children Sir answered the Curate it is not a quarter of an hour since I received this letter written by him to his wise It was enclosed in one to me and conrains a small draft for the use of his wife he requests me to deliver it to her and to console her for his absence As she is dead I have opened the letter here it is be so kind as to read it Mr Churchill eagerly took the letter and read as follows  Dear wife  I cannot think without uneasiness on the trouble that my absence must have occasioned you But let me inform you of what has happened to me Being on my way to  the clergyman's house I began to think in this manner Of what use will it be to me to go begging thus I shall only get rid of one debt by contracting another and shall gain nothing but the uneasiness of thinking how to pay it I that am yet young and can work to go and ask so much money I shall be taken either for an idle fellow or a drinker The parson to be sure married us and loves us as his children but if he were to take a dislike and refuse me or on the other hand if he were not able to relieve us And then supposing that he advanced me the sum for a year should I be sure to have it in my power to pay him and if I did not should not I be as bad as a thief It would be defrauding him Thus I reasoned my dear Margaret and began afterwards to think how I might extricate our affairs by acting in a juster manner I often sighed and put up my prayers to heaven At last it came into my head all at once thought I you are still a young man you are stout and able bodied what harm would there be if you went on board of a man of war for a few years You can read and write and cast accounts pretty well You may still make a fortune for your wife and children at least you may clear all your debts Consider that if you have good success and happen on some prize money it will be the making of your wife For above half an hour these were my thoughts when at last I saw part of a pressgang at a distance behind me They soon came up with me and asked me whence I came where I was bound and whether I would go as a volunteer I seemed at first not to like the sea but they questioned me again and promised me a bounty of five pounds I told them that for so much I would serve during the war Done said they Come along with us my lad and the affair shall be settled presently They brought me before the lieutenant who asked me some questions and I answered them so much to his satisfaction that he advanced my bounty immediately And thus my dear Margaret I have entered the king's service to clear my affairs I send you a draft for the five pounds I would not keep a penny of it Pay the forty shillings that we owe and whatsoever else may be due With the remainder do the best you can to keep house Live well that you may recover your strength Clothe our children and send them soon to school I  know that although you are handy and careful you will not be able to make this sum last very long But patience my wages are s d  per  month I will try if I cannot find a way to forward part of them to you at the end of a few months and whenever we arrive in harbour I shall ask leave to go on shore on purpose to see you My dear Margaret do not grieve trust in God We may soon have a peace I will then return to you and we shall begin housekeeping together once more My lieutenant has promised me to write to our churchwardens that the parish may not be uneasy on my account Bring up our children carefully make them stick to home and be fond of work Pray with them every day and teach them their duty that they may grow up to be honest men for you are very capable of instructing them well Live in the fear of the Lord pray to him for me and I will pray to him in your behalf Answer me soon You have only to give your letter to the doctor he knows best how to direct it Remember me to the two boys Tell Jack that if he is a good lad I will bring him home something at my return God be praised for all things Continue still to love me who remain  Your ever faithful husband JOHN JOHNSON  Mr Churchill's eyes were filled with tears while he read this letter When he had finished it This man cried he may truly be called a good husband a good father and an honest man Sir there is a real pleasure in contributing to the happiness of such excellent people As to John's debts I will pay them and will enable him besides to take up his trade again decently Let this money remain for the children who have cost their father dear and let it be divided between them as soon as they are capable of doing for themselves Till then keep it in your hands and speak to them at times of it as of the strongest proof of a father's affection I will pay you interest for it to be joined with the capital for I wish to have some part in this sacred deposit The worthy curate was too much affected to be able to answer Mr Churchill The latter understood the force of his silence and squeezing him by the hand took his leave  All his designs in favour of John have been executed John being safe returned enjoys an easiness of circumstances which he never experienced before and would be the happiest of men but for his grief for the loss of Margaret He finds no other comfort than in talking of her constantly with Susan This worthy woman looks upon herself as his sister and as a mother to his children Little Jack never lets a single day pass without going to his mother's grave He has made so good a use of Mr Churchill's generosity in improving himself that this excellent gentleman has it in view to establish him in the most advantageous manner He has taken the same care of John's younger son and he never mounts his horse without recalling to mind this affecting incident Whenever he meets any subject of chagrin he goes to see the persons whom he has made happy and always returns home relieved of every uneasy sensation  THE MASONS ON THE LADDER  AS Mr Dormer was walking one day with little Archibald his son in one of the public squares they stopped before a house that was building and which was raised as high as the second story Archibald remarked a number of workmen placed one above another upon the rounds of a ladder who were moving their arms up and down successively This appearance excited his curiosity Papa cried he what game are those men playing Let us go a little nearer to the foot of the ladder  They placed themselves in a spot where there was no danger and observed a man go and take a large stone from a heap and carry it to another man placed on the first round of the ladder and he raising his arms above his head handed the stone to a third who was placed above him who by the same operation passed it up to a fourth and thus from one hand to another the stone very soon reached the scaffold where the masons were ready to make use of it  What do you think of this sight said Mr Dormer to his son Why are so many persons employed in building this house Would it not be better that one man singly should work at it and that the rest should go and each build for himself  Very true indeed papa answered Archibald there would then be many more houses than there are  Do you consider well said Mr Dormer what you now say Do you know how many arts and trades are concerned in forming such a house as this One single man therefore who would undertake a building should be master of all these professions so that he would spend his whole life in acquiring those different sorts of knowledge before he could begin to build But supposing that he could in a short time perfect himself in every thing necessary to be known for the purpose see him all alone and without any assistance first digging the earth to lay his foundation then going to seek stone hewing it making mortar plaister and whitewash in short preparing every thing necessary to a mason See him fell of ardor taking his measurements raising his ladders erecting his scaffolds but in what time do you think his house would be raised to the top  Archibald  Ah papa I am greatly afraid that he would never be able to finish it  Mr Dermer  You are very right child and it is the same with all the labours of society Were a man to withdraw himself totally and work for himself alone were he to refuse to borrow the aid of others fearing to be obliged to lend them his in return he would exhaust his strength in the undertaking and see himself quickly under the necessity of abandoning it whereas if men lend their assistance mutually they execute in a short time the most puzzling and laborious works to perform which each of them singly would require the course of a whole life It is the same also with the pleasures of life he who would taste them alone could procure to himself but few enjoyments but let all unite in contributing to their mutual happiness and each will find his share in this union You are one day to be a member of society my dear child Let the example of these workmen be always present to your memory You see how much they ease and shorten their labours by mutually aiding each other We  will pass by here again some days hence and we shall find their house finished Endeavour therefore to help others in their undertakings if you wish that they should in their turn exert themselves to labour for you  THE SWORD A DRAMA in ONE ACT  CHARACTERS  LORD ONSBURGH  AUGUSTUS  his Son  HENRIETTA  his Daughter  ELDER RAYNTON  Friends of Augustus  YOUNGER RAYNTON  Friends of Augustus  ELDER DUDLEY  Friends of Augustus  YOUNGER DUDLEY  Friends of Augustus  CRAPE  a Servant to Lord Onsburgh  SCENE  The Apartment of Augustus  SCENE I  Augustus  AHA this is my birthday They did well to tell me otherwise I should never have thought of it Well it will bring me some new present from papa But let's see what will he give me Crape had something under his coat when he went into papa's room He would not let me go in with him Ah if I were not obliged to appear a little more sedate than usual I should have forced him to shew me what he was carrying But hist I shall soon know it Here comes my papa  SCENE II  Lord Onsburgh holding in his hand a sword and belt Augustus  Lord Onsh  Ah are you there Augustus I have already wished you joy of your birthday but that is not enough is it  Aug  Oh papabut what have you in your hand there  Lord Onsb  Something that I fear will not become you well A sword look ye  Aug  What is it for me Oh give it to me dear papa I will be  so  good and  so  diligent for the future  Lord Onsb  Ah if I thought that But do you know that a sword requires a man That he must be no longer a child who wears one but should conduct himself with circumspection and decency and in short that it is not the sword that adorns the man but the man that adorns the sword  Aug  Oh never fear me I shall adorn mine I warrant and I'll have nothing to say to those mean persons  Lord Onsb  When do you call those mean persons  Aug  I mean those who cannot wear a sword and a bag those who are no of the  bility as you and I are  Lord Onsb  For my part I know no mean persons but those who have a wrong way of thinking and a worse of conducting themselves who are disobedient to their parents rude and unmannerly to others so that I see many mean persons among the nobility and many noble amongst those whom you call mean  Aug  Yes I think in the same manner  Lord Onsb  What were you talking then just now of a bag and sword Do you think that the real advantages of nobility consist in those fopperies They serve to distinguish ranks because it is necessary that ranks should be distinguished in the world But the most levated rank does only add more disgrace to the man unworthy to fill it  Aug  So I believe papa But it will be no disgrace to me to have a sword and to wear it  Lord Onsb  No I mean that you will render yourself worthy of this distinction no otherwise than by your good behaviour Here is your sword but remember  Aug  Oh yes papa You shall see    He endeavours to put the sword by his side but cannot Lord Onsburgh helps him to bu  le it on    Lord Onsb  Eh why it does not sit so ill  Aug  Does it now Oh I knew that  Lord Onsb  It becomes you surprizingly But above all things remember what I told you Good bye    Going be returns    I had forgot I have just sent for your little party of friends to spend this day with you Observe to behave yourself suitably  Aug  Yes papa  SCENE III  Augustus    He struts up and down the stage and now and then looks back to see if his sword be behind him    This is fine this is being something like a gentleman let any of your citizens come in my way now No more familiarity if they do not wear a sword and if they take it amiss Ahaout with my rapier But hold let us see first if it has a good blade    drawing his sword and using furious gestures    What does that tradesman mean to affront meOnetwoAh you defend yourself do you Die scoundrel  SCENE IV  Henrietta Augustus  Henrietta    who screams on hearing those last words    Bless me Augustus are you mad  Aug  Is it you sister  Henrietta  Yes you see it is But what do you do with that instrument    pointing to the sword    Aug  Do with it what a gentleman should do  Henrietta  And who is he that you are going to send out of the world  Aug  The first that shall dare to take the wall of me  Henrietta  I see there are many lives in danger And if I should happen to be the person  Aug  You I would not advise you I wear a sword now you see Papa made me a present of it  Henrietta  I suppose to go and kill people right or wrong  Aug  An't I the honourable If they do not give me the respects due smack a box on the ear and if your  little commoner will be impertinentsword in hand    going to draw it    Henrietta  Oh leave it in quiet brother And lest I should run the risque of affronting you unknowingly I wish to be informed what the respect is that you demand  Aug  You shall soon see My father has just sent for some of my young acquaintance If those little puppies do not behave themselves respectfully you shall see how I will manage  Henrietta  Very well but I ask you what we must do to behave ourselves respectfully towards you  Aug  In the first place I insist upon a low bow very low  Henrietta    with an affected gravity making him a low curtsy    Your lordship's most humble servant Was that well  Aug  No joking Henrietta if you please or else  Henrietta  Nay I am quite serious I assure you We must take care to know and perform our duty to respectable persons It would not be amiss to inform your little friends too  Aug  Oh I will have some sport with those fellows give one a pull t'other a pinch and play all sorts of tricks on them  Henrietta  Those I take it are some of the duties of a gentleman that wears a sword but if those  fellows  should not like the sport and return it on the gentleman's ear    Aug  What low vulgar blood No they have neither hearts nor swords  Henrietta  Really papa could not have given you a more useful present He saw plainly what a hero was concealed in the person of his son and that he wanted but a sword to shew him in his proper light  Aug  Hark ye sister it is my birthday we must divert ourselves However you will not say any thing of it to papa  Henrietta  Why not he would not have given you a sword if he did not expect some exploit of this sort from a gentleman newly equipt Would he have advised you otherwise  Aug  Certainly you know that he is always preaching to me  Henrietta  What has he been preaching to you then  Aug  I don't know not I That I should adorn my sword and not my sword me  Henrietta  In that case you understood him properly I must say To adorn one's sword is to know how to make use of it and you are willing to shew already that you have that knowledge  Aug  Very well sister You think to joke but I would have you to know madam  Henrietta  Oh I know extremely well all that you can tell me but do you know too that there is one principal ornament wanting to your sword  Aug  What is that    Unbuckles the belt and looks all over the sword    I do not see that there is the least thing wanting  Henrietta  Really you are a very clever swordsman But a swordknot now Ah how a blue and silver knot would dangle from that hilt  Aug  You are right Henrietta Hark ye you have a whole bandbox full of ribbands in your room so  Henrietta  I was thinking of it provided that you do not give me a specimen of your fencing or lay your blade about me in return  Aug  Nonsense here is my hand that is enough you have nothing to fear But quick a handsome knot When my little party comes they shall see me in all my grandeur  Henrietta  Give it to me then  Aug    giving her the sword    There make haste You will leave it in my room on the table that I may find it when I want it  Henrietta  Depend on me  SCENE V  Augustus Henrietta Crape  Crape  The two Master Dudleys and the Master Rayntons are below  Aug  Well cannot they come up Must I go to receive them at the bottom of the stairs  Crape  My lady ordered me to tell you to come and meet them  Aug  No no it is better to wait for them here  Henrietta  Nay but since mama desires that you will go down  Aug  Indeed they are worth all that ceremony Well I shall go directly Come what are you doing Will this make my swordknot Go run and let me find it on my table properly done    Going out    Do you hear  SCENE VI  Henrietta  The little insolent in what a tone he speaks to me Luckily I have the sword A proper instrument indeed in the hand of so quarrelsome a boy Yes yes stay till I return it to you My papa does not know you so well as I but he must be toldAh here he is  SCENE VII  Lord Onsburgh Henrietta  Henrietta  You are come in good time papa I was going to you  Lord Onsb  What have you then of so much consequence to tell meBut what do you do with your brother's sword  Henrietta  I have promised him to put a handsome knot to it but it was only to get this dangerous weapon out of his hands Do not give it to him again whatever you do  Lord Onsb  Why should I take back a present that I have given him  Henrietta  At least be so good as to keep it until he becomes more peaceable I just now sound him all alone laying about him like Don Quixote and threatening to make his first trial of fencing upon his companions that come to see him  Lord Onsb  The little quarreller If he will use it for his first exploits they shall not turn out to his honour I promise you Give me this sword  Henrietta    gives him the sword    There sir I hear him on the stairs  Lord Onsb  Run make his knot and bring it to me when it is ready    They go out

right to  mand it  Elder Dudley  Softly Raynton It does not become  in a strange house  Elder Raynton  It is still less becoming to be unpolite in one's own house  Aug    haughtily    Unpolite I unpolite Is it because I walked before you  Elder Raynton  That is the very reason Whenever we have the honour to receive your visits or those of any other person we never take the precedence  Aug  You only do your duty But from you to me  Elder Raynton  What then from you to me  Aug  Are you noble  Elder Raynton    to the two Dudleys and his brother    Let us leave him to himself with his nobility if you wi  take my advice  Elder Dudley  Fie Mr Onsburgh If you think it beneath your dignity to keep company with us why invite us here We did not ask that honour  Aug  It was not I that

turkey's feather He stops short in confusion The little ones burst into a loud laugh and come up    Elder Raynton  Come on Let us see the temper of your sword  Elder Dudley  Do not add to his confusion He only deserves contempt  Younger Raynton  Aha this was it then that you alone had a right to wear  Younger Dudley  He will do no great harm to any body with that terrible weapon  Elder Raynton  I could punish you now for your rudeness but I should blush to take such a revenge  Elder Dudley  He is no longer worthy of our company Let us all leave him to himself  Younger Raynton  Good

without seeing him  SCENE XIII  Lord Onsburgh Augustus elder Raynton younger Raynton  lder Dudley younger Dudley    They all put on an air of respect at the entrance of Lord Onsburgh Augustus goes aside and cries for spite    Lord Onsb    to Augustus looking at him with indignation    What is this sir that I hear    Augustus sobs and cannot speak    Elder Raynton  My lord you will pardon this disturbance that appears amongst us It was not caused by us From the first moment of our coming Mr Onsburgh received us so ill  Lord Onsb  Do not be uneasy my dear little friend I know all I was in the next room and heard from  the beginning my son's unbecoming discourse He is the more blameable as he had just been making me the fairest promises I have suspected his impertinence for a long time but I wished to see myself how far he was capable of carrying it and for fear of mischief I put a blade to his sword that as you see will not spill much blood    The children barst out a laughing    Elder Raynton  Excuse the freedom my lord that I took in te  ling him the truth a little bluntly  Lord Onsh  I rather owe you my thanks for it You are an excellent young gentleman and deserve much better than he does to wear this badge of honour As a token of my esteem and acknowledgment accept this sword but I will first put a blade to it that may be more worthy of you  Elder Raynton  Your lordship is too good but allow us to withdraw Our company may not be agreeable to Mr Onsburgh today  Lord Onsh  No no my dear boys you shall stay My son's presence shall not disturb your pleasure You may divert yourselves together and my daughter shall take care to provide you with whatever may amuse you Come with me into another apartment As for you sir    to Augustus    do not offer to stir from this place You may celebrate your birthday here all alone You shall never have a sword until you deserve it if you were even to grow old without wearing one  PRISCILLA AND MARCUS  MRS CAREY a young widow had two children Pris  illa and Marcus both equally deserving of her affecti  n which nevertheless they shared very unequally  young as she was perceived her mama's part ality to her brother It afflicted her but she conce  led within her own breast the sorrow which this preserence  o  ioned her Though not disagreeably plain  features did not correspond with the charms of her  ind but her brother was beautiful as the God of Love is painted to us All the f  ndness all the caresses of  Mrs Carey were lavished on him alone and the servants to gain the favour of their mistress were studious to flatter him in all his fancies Priscilla on the contrary from her mother's coldness found herself the more slighted by the rest of the family Far from anticipating her wishes they even neglected her real wants She would shed floods of tears when she found herself alone and forsaken by every body but never suffered the slightest complaint or mark of discontent to escape her in the presence of others In vain did she endeavour by a constant observance of her duty by her mildness and her attentions to make amends in her mother's opinion for the deficiency of her beauty the qualities of her mind were unnoticed by eyes accustomed only to look on outward advantages Mrs Carey not much affected by the marks of tenderness which Priscilla shewed her seemed particularly since her husband's death to view her with a kind of disgust She was continually chiding her and required perfections in her which could not even be expected from an understanding far more advanced  This unjust mother fell sick Marcus appeared strongly touched at her sufferings but Priscilla who in the softened looks and languid countenance of her mother thought she perceived an abatement of her accustomed severity far surpassed her brother in her care and vigilance Attentive to her mother's slightest wants she exerted all her penetration to discover them that she might spare her even the trouble of expressing them While her mother's illness had the least appearance of danger she never quitted her pillow Entreaties or even commands could not prevail upon her to take a moment's repose At length Mrs Carey recovered This happy circumstance dissipated the apprehensions of Priscilla but her sorrows began afresh when she saw her mama reassume her usual severity towards her  One day when Mrs Carey was discoursing with her children of the pains that she had suffered during her illness and was thanking them for the tender and earnest affection which their cares for her had testified "My dear children added she you may both ask of me whatever will give you most pleasure I promise to grant it to you if your desires are within the extent of my fortune  What do you wish Marcus said she first to her son A watch and a cane mama replied heYou shall have them tomorrow morning  And you PriscillaMe mama me answered she trembling I have nothing to wish for if you love me  That is not an answer You shall have your recompense too miss What would you wish Speak  Though Priscilla had been accustomed to this tone of severity yet she felt it more sensibly on this occasion than ever she had done before She threw herself at her mother's feet looked up to her with eyes all drowned in tears and suddenly hiding her face with both her hands lisped out these words "Give me only two kisses such as you give my brother"  Mrs Carey's heart melted at these words and she felt those sentiments of affection to her daughter now revive which she had hitherto suppressed Taking her up in her arms she clasped her to her breast and loaded her with kisses Priscilla who for the first time received her mother's caresses gave a loose to the effusions of her joy and love She kissed her cheeks her eyes her breast her hands and Marcus who could not help loving his sister mixed his embraces with her's They all enjoyed a happiness which was not confined to the present moment Mrs Carey repaid with interest to Priscilla that affection which she had before withheld from her and Priscilla returned it with new marks of tenderness Nor was Marcus in the least jealous on this account but rejoiced in his sister's happiness He soon reaped the reward of so generous a behaviour The natural goodness of his disposition having been a little injured by the weakness and doating fondness of his mother he gave way in youth to many little indiscretions which would have lost him her heart but Priscilla always found means to excuse him to her The sensible advice too which she gave him completed the reform of his manners and they all three experienced that there is no true happiness in a family without the most cerdial union between brothers and sisters and the most lively and equal affection between parents and children  THE LAMB  LITTLE Flora the daughter of a poor countryman was seated one morning by the side of the road holding on her lap a porringer of milk for her breakfast in which she sopped a few slices of coarse black bread Just then a farmer was passing the road who had in his cart about a score of lambs that he was going to sell at the market These poor creatures crowded one upon the other with their feet tied together and their heads hanging down filled the air with plaintive bleatings which pierced the heart of Flora but were heard by the farmer with an ear of unconcern  When he was come up opposite to the little country girl he threw down before her a lamb which he was carrying across his shoulder "There my girl said he is a goodfornothing beast that has just died and made me five shillings the poorer Take it if you will and make a stew of it"  Flora quitted her breakfast laid down her porringer and her bread and taking up the lamb began to examine it with looks of compassion "But said she immediately why should I pity you Today or tomorrow they would have run a great knife through your throat while now you have nothing more to fear" While she was speaking thus the lamb revived by the warmth of her arms opened its eyes a little made a slight motion and cried  baa  faintly as if it was calling its mother It would be difficult to express the little girl's joy She covers the lamb with her apron and over that with her stuff petticoat bends her breast down towards her lap to warm it still more and blows with all her force into its nostrils and mouth She felt the poor animal stir by degrees and at each of its motions she felt her own heart throb Encouraged by this first success she crumbles some soft bread into her porringer and taking it up in her fingers with some difficulty forced it between its teeth which were shut fast The lamb which was dying only through hunger felt itself a little strengthened by this nourishment It began now to stretch its limbs to shake its head to wag its tail and to prick up its ears It had soon strength enough to support itself upon its legs and  then went of its own accord to Flora's porringer who smiled to see it drink up her breakfast In short before a quarter of an hour was past it had already played a thousand little gambols  Flora transported with joy took it up in her arms and running to the cottage shewed it to her mother Baba so she named it became from that moment the object of all her cares She shared with it the little bread which was given her for her meals and would not have exchanged it singly for the largest flock in the neighbourhood Baba was so gratefully sensible of her fondness that she never quitted Flora a single step she would come to eat out of her hand would frisk round her and whenever she was obliged to go out without her would bleat most pitifully  This was not the only recompence with which Heaven repaid Flora's compassionate tenderness Baba brought forth young lambs and these others in their turn so that in a few years after Flora had a pretty flock that nourished all her family with their milk and furnished them comfortable clothing from their wool  THE VINESTUMP  MR Sutton being at his countryhouse in the spring went out with his son Julius to walk in his garden The violet and primrose were in their bloom and many trees began already to shew their budding verdure and to be clothed in white and crimson blossoms  They went by chance into a summerhouse at the foot of which rose a vinestump twisting wildly and stretching its naked branches in a rude irregular manner "Papa cried Julius see this ugly tree how it points at me why do not you have Martin to grub it up and make firewood of it" At the same time he began to pull at it in order to tear it up but its roots had taken too firm hold in the earth "Do not molest it said Mr Sutton to his son I will have it stand as it is and at the proper time I shall tell you my reasons"  Julius  But papa see close by it those lively blossoms of the lilac and the laurustinus Why is not it as well adorned as they are if it is to be kept It spoils and disfigures the garden Shall I go and tell Martin to pluck it up  Mr Sutton  No my dear I tell you I will have it stand as it is at least a little longer  Julius persevered in condemning it his father tried to divert his attention to other objects and the unfortunate vinestump was forgotten  Mr Sutton's affairs called him to a distant part of the country He set off the next day and did not return till the middle of Autumn His first care was to visit his countryhouse whither he brought his son once more The day being very hot they went to enjoy the shade of the summerhouse "Ah papa said Julius what a charming green shade I thank you for having that ugly dry stump plucked up that I was so uneasy to see last Spring and for putting in its place this handsome shrub to give me an agreeable surprize What delightful fruit See these fine grapes some purple others almost black There is not a single tree in the garden that looks so well They have all lost their fruit but thissee how it is covered see those large green leaves that hide the clusters I should like to know if the fruit be as good as it appears handsome"  Mr Sutton gave him a grape to taste This renewed his joy and how much was it enlivened when his father informed him that from those berries was produced that delicious liquor which he sometimes tasted after dinner "You seem to be astonished my dear said Mr Sutton I should surprize you much more were I to tell you that this is the same crooked mishapen stump that pointed at you in the Spring I will go if you chuse and order Martin to pluck it up and make firewood of it"  Julius  Oh by no means papa let him take all the others in the garden before this I do like the grapes so well  Mr Sutton  You see then Julius that I did well in not following your advice What has happened to you happens frequently in the world We see a child ill clothed and of an unpleasing outside appearance we despise him and grow proud on comparing ourselves with  him we even carry our cruelty so far as to address him with insulting discourses Beware my child of such hasty judgments In this person so little favoured by nature dwells perhaps an exalted soul which will one day astonish the world by its great virtues or enlighten it by its knowledge It is a rugged stem but may produce the noblest fruits  CAROLINE  LITTLE Caroline of whom we have spoken page was one day playing beside her mother who was then busy writing letters The hairdresser being come Mrs Ptold him to step into an adjoining dressingroom with Caroline and to take a little of her hair off Instead of a little the hairdresser took off so much that the little girl's head was entirely naked Her mother entered just as this unlucky operation was finished "Ah my poor Caroline exclaimed she you have lost all your fine hair""Do not be uneasy mama answered Caroline with the greatest simplicity it is not lost it is put up in that drawer"  Last Summer vacation while she was in the country a chicken was served up at dinner and Mrs P who had no company but her children having helped her eldest daughter to some of it offered a bit to Caroline  No mama answered she with a sigh I shall not eat any of it  And why my dear  Because mama that chicken and I saw one another every day and we lived very friendly together  But your sister eats some of it  Oh my sister may eat it to be sure she was not so well acquainted with it as I was  What may not be hoped from a child born with such amiable simplicity and such tenderness of heart May she resemble her mother more and more and all my wishes for her will be accomplished  THE FARMER  SIR John Downton had shut himself up one morning in his study in order to give his attention to some affairs of consequence A servant came to inform him that farmer Martin his tenant was at the streetdoor and desired to speak with him Sir John ordered him to shew the farmer into the drawingroom and to request him to stay a moment until his letters should be finished Robert Arthur and Sophia Sir John Downton's children were in the drawingroom when Mr Martin was introduced He saluted them respectfully as he entered but it was easy to see that he had not learned his bow from the dancingmaster nor were his compliments of a more elegant turn The two boys looked one at the other smiling with an air of contempt Their eyes measured him very familiarly from head to foot They whispered each other and laughed out so loud that the poor man blushed and did not know what countenance to put on Robert even carried his incivility so far as to walk round him holding his nose and asking his brother "Arthur do not you perceive something of the smell of a dungheap" And going for a chasing dish of hot coals he burnt some paper over it and carried it round the room to disperse as he said the unpleasant smell He then called a servant and desired him to sweep up the dirt that Martin had left on the floorcloth with his nailed shoes Arthur mean time held hissides laughing at his brother's impertinences  It was not the same with Sophia their sister Instead of imitating the rudeness of her brothers she reproved them for it endeavoured to excuse them to the farmer and approaching him with looks of goodnature offered him wine to refresh himself made him sit down and took his hat and stick herself and laid them by In the mean time Sir John came out of his study and approaching farmer Martin in a friendly manner took him by the hand asked how his wife and children were and what had brought him to town "Sir answered the farmer I come to pay you my halfyear's rent" and at the same time he drew out of his pocket a leathern bag full of  money "You will not be displeased continued he that I have been something beyond my time our roads were so flooded that I could not carry my corn to market sooner"  "I am not at all displeased with you replied Sir John I know that you are an honest man and have no occasion to be put in mind of your engagements" At the same time he had a table laid before the farmer to count the money on Robert stared at the sight of farmer Martin's guineas and seemed to look at him with a little more respect  When Sir John had counted the farmer's money and found it right the latter drew out of his greatcoat pocket a small jar of candied fruits "I have brought something said he for the young folks Won't you be so good Sir John as to let them come out one of these days and take a mouthful of the country air with us I'd try to entertain and amuse them too as well as I could I have two good stout nags and would come for them myself and take them down in my fourwheeled chaise"  Sir John premised to go and see him and would have kept him to dinner but Mr Martin thanked him for his kind invitation and excused himself for not being able to accept it as he had many bargains to make in town and was in a hurry to return home Sir John filled his pockets with cakes for his children thanked him for the present that he had made to his and having wished him good health as well to support his fatigues as on his family's account saw him down stairs and took his leave  As soon as he was gone Sophia before her brothers informed her father of the rude reception which they had given to the honest farmer Sir John expressed his displeasure at Robert and Arthur and at the same time commended Sophia for her conduct "I see said he kissing her that my little Sophia knows how to behave herself to honest people"  As it was about breakfast hour he opened the farmer's jar of fruits and eat some of them with his daughter and they both thought them excellent Robert and Arthur were at table too but were not invited to taste the fruits They devoured them with their eyes but Sir John did not seem to observe their longings He resumed his commendations of Sophia and exhorted her never to despise  a person for the plainness of his dress "For said he if we were to behave politely only to those who are well clad we should seem to direct our civilities to the dress not to the person who wears it People in the most homely clothing are often the most honest we have an instance of it in farmer Martin He not only by his labour supports himself his wife and children but during these six years that he is my tenant he pays his rents so punctually that I have never had the smallest fault to find with him in that respect Yes my dear Sophia if this man was not so honest I could not supply the expence of maintaining you and your brothers It is he who clothes you and procures you a good education for it is in clothing you and paying the expences of your instruction that I dispose of the sums which he pays me every halfyear"  After the breakfast was finished he ordered the remainder to be locked up in the beauset Robert and Arthur followed it with desiring eyes and saw plainly that it was not kept for them In this their father soon confirmed them "Do not expect said he to taste these fruits either today or any other time When the farmer who brought them shall have reason to be satisfied with you he will not fail to send you some"  Robert  But papa is it my fault if he did not smell well  Sir John  How did he smell then  Robert  Of the dungheap insufferably  Sir John  Whence could he have contracted that smell  Robert  From his loading carts with it every day  Sir John  What should he do then to get rid of it  Robert  He shouldhe should  Sir John  He should perhaps not put dung upon his grounds at all  Robert  There is only that way  Sir John  But if he did not enrich his land how could he draw a plentiful crop from it And if he had always bad crops how could he manage to pay me the rent of his farm  Robert would have replied but his father gave him a look in which Arthur and he plainly read his displeasure The next Sunday very early the good farmer was at Sir John Downton's door He sent up his compliments and kindly invited him to come and take an excursion to  his farm Sir John pleased with his hearty obliging manner would not mortify him by a refusal Robert and Arthur earnestly entreated their father to make them of the party and promised to behave themselves more civilly Sir John yielding to their solicitations they mounted the fourwheeled chaise with joyful looks and as the farmer had a pair of excellent horses and drove well they were at his house before they had any suspicion of it Who can describe their satisfaction when the chaise stopped Cicely wife to farmer Martin appeared with a smiling countenance at the wicket which she opened and saluted her guests and taking the children in her arms to help them down she kissed them and led them into the yard All her own children were there in their best clothes who welcomed the young gentlemen saluting them with great respect Sir John would willingly have stopped a moment to talk with the little ones and caress them but Mrs Martin pressed him to go in lest the coffee should grow cold It was already poured out at a table which was covered with a napkin as white as snow The coffeepot was not of silver nor the cups of china yet every thing was in the neatest order Robert and Arthur however looked at each other slily and would have burst out in a laugh if they had not feared to offend their father But Cicely guessing their thoughts by the looks which they exchanged made an apology for their fare which she confessed was not so fine as they would have had at their own house however she hoped that they would be satisfied with the cheerful entertainment of poor people With the coffee they had muffins of a delicious taste It was easy to see that Mrs Martin had used all her art in kneading and baking them  After breaksast the farmer asked Sir John to look at his orchard and grounds to which he consented Cicely took all the pains imaginable to make this walk agreeable to the children She shewed them all her flocks which covered the fields and gave them the prettiest lambs to play with She then led them to her pigeonhouse every thing there was clean and wholesome there were on the ground two young pigeons which had just quitted their nest but did not dare as yet to trust their callow wings Some of the mothers were sitting over their eggs and  others busied in giving nourishment to their young which had just broken the shell From the pigeonhouse they went to the beehives Cicely took care that they should not go too near them but however she gave them a view of the bees at work  As most of these sights were new to the children they seemed very much delighted with them they were even going to take a second review of them if farmer Martin's youngest son Tom had not come to inform them that dinner waited They were served on pewter and drank out of Delft ware but Robert and Arthur were still so full of the pleasure of their morning's walk that they were ashamed to indulge their satirical humour they thought every thing excellent It is true Cicely had surpassed herself in preparing them the best cheer  After dinner Sir John perceived two fiddles hung up against the wall What person here plays those instruments said he  My eldest son and I answered the farmer and without saying any more he made a sign to Luke his son to take down the fiddles They played by turns some old tunes on the fiddles both sprightly and pathetic of which Sir John expressed his satisfaction in the most flattering manner  As they were going to hang up the instruments again "Come Robert and Arthur said Sir John it is now your turns Play us some of your best tunes" and at the same time he put the fiddles into their hands But they did not know even how to hold the bow and their confusion raised a general laugh  Sir John then requested the farmer to put the horses to that they might return to town Martin pressed him strongly to pass the night with him but at length yielded to Sir John's excuses"Well Robert said that gentleman to his son as they returned how do you find yourself after your little journey"  Robert  Very well papa Those good people have done their utmost to give us every satisfaction  Sir J Downton  I am happy to see you satisfied But if farmer Martin had not taken so much pains in doing the honours of his house if he had not offered you the smallest refreshment would you have been as well pleased with him as you now seem to be  Robert  No certainly  Sir John  What would you have thought of him  Robert  That he was an unmannerly clown  Sir John  Robert Robert this honest man came to our house and far from offering him any refreshment you made game of him Which then is the best bred you or the farmer  Robert    blushing    But it is his duty to receive us well He gains by our lands  Sir John  What do you call gaining  Robert  I mean that he finds it his advantage to gather in the crops of our cornfields and the hay of our meadows  Sir John  You are right A farmer has occasion for all that but what does he do with the grain  Robert  He maintains with it himself his wife and his children  Sir John  And with the hay  Robert  He gives it to his horses to eat  Sir John  And what does he do with his horses  Robert  He uses them in plowing the ground  Sir John  Thus you see that one part of what he gains from the earth returns to it But do you believe that he consumes the remainder with his family and his horses  Robert  The cows have their part of it too  Arthur  And his sheep too and his pigeons and his poultry  Sir John  That is true But are his whole crops consumed upon his own ground  Robert  No I remember to have heard him say that he took part of them to market to sell for money  Sir John  And what does he do with this money  Robert  I saw last week that he brought you a leathern bag full of it  Sir John  You now see who draws the greatest profit from my lands the farmer or I It is true he feeds his horses with hay from the meadows but his horses serve to plow the fields which without these plowings would be exhausted by weeds He feeds his sheep too and his cows with the hay but their dung contributes to make the fallow grounds fruitful His wife and his children are sed with the corn of the harvests but in return they pass the summer in weeding the crops and afterwards some in reaping them some in threshing and these labours  again turn to my advantage The rest of his corn and hay he takes to market to sell them but it is in order to give me the money that he receives Suppose that there remains some part for himself is it not fair that he should have a recompence for his labours Now therefore once more tell me which of us two draws the greatest profits from my lands  Robert  I now plainly see that you do  Sir John  And without this tenant should I have that profit  Robert  Oh there are many tenants to be had  Sir John  You are right but not one more honest than this I had formerly let this farm to another who impoverished the land cut down the trees and let the outhouses run to ruin At quarterday he never had any money for me and when I would expostulate with him he shewed me clearly that his whole stock was not sufficient to answer my demand  Robert  Ah the knave  Sir John  If this man were of the same kind should I receive much profit from my estate  Robert  Certainly not  Sir John  To whom then am I obliged for what I do receive  Robert  I see that you owe it to this honest farmer  Sir John  Is it not therefore our duty to receive a man well who renders us so great services  Robert  Ah papa you make me see very plainly that I was wrong  For some minutes a deep silence ensued Sir John then resumed the discourse thus Robert why did not you play upon the fiddle  Robert  You know papa that I have never learned  Sir John  Then farmer Martin's son knows something that you do not  Robert  That is true But then does he understand Latin as I do  Sir John  And do you know how to plow can you drive a team can you sow wheat barley oats and other grain or rear a crop of them Would you know how so much as to fix a hoppole or prune a tree so as to have good fruit  Robert  I have no occasion to know all that I am no farmer  Sir John  But if all the people in the world knew nothing else but Latin how would things go then  Robert  Very ill we should have no bread no vegetables  Sir John  And could the world do very well even though nobody knew Latin  Robert  I believe it could  Sir John  Remember then all your life what you have just seen and heard This farmer so coarsely clad who saluted and addressed you in so rustick a manner this man is better bred than you knows much more than you and things of much greater use Therefore you see how unjust it is to despise any one for the plainness of his dress or the ungracefulness of his manner  THE FATHERS RECONCILED BY THEIR CHILDREN  A DRAMA in one ACT  CHARACTERS  MR CRUMPTON  CONSTANTINE  his Son  ALICIA  his Daughter  THOMAS  Son of the apothecary of the village  GRACE  his Sister  The scene lies in a garden under the windows of Mr Crumpton's house in the country On one side a summerhouse and at the bottom of the stage a tuft of trees  SCENE I  Mr Crumpton Alicia and Constantine  Alicia  BUT papa  Mr Crumpton  I repeat it to you Let neither of you henceforward under pain of my displeasure have the least connexion with the apothecary's children  Alicia  What has made you so angry then with Mr Garvey  Mr Crumpton  Am I obliged to give you an account  Constantine  No certainly It does not become us to question you    to Alicia    When my papa gives his orders it is our business to obey without reply  Mr Crumpton  Yes that is my meaning Mr Garvey is an obstinate disobliging person Ungrateful to refuse such a matter to me who am his landlord and from whom he enjoys his fortune and livelihood  Constantine  That is scandalous papa and I do not know why we have been so long connected with the children of such people Indeed if there had been one genteel boy besides in our neighbourhood I should never have spoken a word to Thomas  Alicia  O papa can you hear my brother talk so Thomas and Grace are such good children we should be very happy if we were as good as they  Mr Crumpton  What is it to me whether they be good or bad Once more I forbid you to have a word of discourse with them or else I shall keep you shut up at home  Constantine  Let Thomas dare so much as to come sneaking about this garden I'll give him  Mr Crumpton  What would you say I do not intend that they should be illtreated or affronted in the smallest matter  Constantine    confused    Nay I do not mean that neither I only say that I will not let them come within a hundred yards of us Oh I shall keep a look out  Alicia  Yet you had so great a friendship for Mr Garvey You looked upon him as so honest a man as a man of so much learning and good sense you remember very well that it was he who taught my brother Latin and gave me my first lessons in spelling merely through friendship before we had a master  Mr Crumpton  All that may be but I forbid another word on the subject I will have nothing to say to him as you shall have nothing to say to his children What I think you cry Dry up those tears Miss Have you then so little respect for your father's commands that it costs you tears to obey them  Alicia  No papa But pardon this last mark of regard that my heart affords them I shall not be less obedient than my brother  Constantine  We shall see who will be most dutiful  Alicia  At least you will not insist that I should hate them It would not be in my power to obey you  Mr Crumpton  Neither to hate them nor to use them ill only to break off all connexion with them This is my order  Alicia  I will do whatever is your pleasure But I have one favour to ask you  Mr Crumpton  What is that  Alicia  That I may speak to them once more to tell them your orders  Constantine  For what all correspondence is at an end  Mr Crumpton  I think your request reasonable and grant it You may tell them at the same time that their father must pay me in three days or else he will repent it  Alicia  How my dear papa does Mr Garvey owe you any thing  Mr Crumpton  Do you think that I would ask him for what he did not owe me But that does not concern you Only remember to obey me    He goes out    SCENE II  Alicia and Constantine  Alicia  Well brother is this your friendship for Thomas and Grace  Constantine  Well sister is this your obedience to your father  Alicia  You pretend to obedience It is hypocrisy nothing more You only flatter him to wheedle some money from him You love nothing in the world  Constantine  Because I do not take pleasure in continually disobliging him Would you have me run after these children now he has forbidden me  Alicia  You little deserved their friendship if it costs you no more to give it up But whenever your expectations from any one are at an end your affection for them soon vanishes  Constantine  As if I had ever any thing to expect from children of that sort  Alicia  What was that case then of mother of pearl which you prevailed on Grace to give you not a week  ago and those tablets that you contrived to coax so dexterously from Tommy yesterday You have cringed to them a thousand times for a nosegay or an orange and now  Constantine  Now I must obey But truly the apothecary's children are fine company to grieve after  Alicia  Yes and I shall see you perhaps this evening in the middle of the dirtiest boys of the village  Constantine  I shall not lose much by the exchange  Alicia  And they still less  Constantine  I do not care But here comes Mr Thomas advise him as a tender friend not to come too near me  Alicia  If you do not like to see him you may go away  Constantine  I do  not  like to see him and I will stay  SCENE III  Alicia Constantine Thomas carrying a little wooden house painted blue  Thomas    to Alicia    Oh how glad I am to find you  Constantine  Dear Tom what have you there in that little house  Thomas  It is a present that Mr Billingsley's gamekeeper made me  Constantine  And you come to make me a present of it my dear friend  Alicia    aside    The hypocrite  Thomas  It is for Miss Alicia  Alicia  For me no no my friend Since it is a present to you I will not deprive you of itBut pray what is it  Constantine    imperiously    Come I'll see what it is    endeavours to snatch the wooden house from Thomas who holds it forcibly    Some ugly bird I suppose  Thomas  An ugly bird no you are out Guess Miss but I wont keep you in pain it is a squirrel Oh a comical little beast it is He always strives to hide himself in your pocket then he comes to eat out of your hand and he runs after you like a little spaniel    He takes it out of its house and gives its chain to Alicia    Don't let it go though He must grow tame with you otherwise he would take a trip to the grove  Constantine    with a look of envy    A fine present indeed a squirrel it smells like a polecat  Alicia  O the charming little creature how sprightly it looks  Thomas  I could have wished Master Constantine to have another to offer you and I will bring you the first that I have When he is a little used to you Miss he will play such tricks as will make you die with laughing He is worse than a monkey  Alicia  For that reason Master Tommy I will not deprive you of it    to the squirrel    Come little rogue go into your house again You must take it back friend Thomas  Constantine  Yes do not you hear You must take it back  Thomas  How he is not mine now You would not disoblige me Miss Alicia No I know you would not    he runs to the summerhouse    There I will leave him here on the bench  Constantine    to Alicia    Only dare to take it and see if papa won't make you pay dear for it  Alicia  I am almost inclined to take it because of your threatening My papa has not forbidden me to receive squirrels I am sorry for poor Tom that I have nothing to give him in return but a sad farewel  Constantine  Well leave it to me I will dismiss both him and his squirrel  Alicia  No no do not take that trouble    to Thomas as be returns    Once more my friend I cannot accept your present I have such disagreeable news for you that I do not know  Constantine  Yes yes Mr Thomas If you shew yourself before our garden or only look at the walls of our house  Thomas  What could you have the heart Sir to hinder me I thought you had more friendship for me  Constantine  Our friendship is broken off to let you know and pray do not think  Alicia  I beg you will excuse his ill manners You do not know perhaps that your father has had a quarrel with ours  Thomas  Pardon me I know it and it has made me uneasy enough However I did not think that the matter  went so far as to break off our friendship And I should still less have expected it from Master Constantine  Constantine  Sister will you send him away immediately or shall I go and acquaint my papa  Thomas  If you are to have any trouble on my account Miss Alicia  Alicia  Do not fear my friend you may stay awhile My papa will not take it amiss  Constantine  We shall see that I will open the cause to him    He goes out but returns a moment afterwards and slips into the summerhouse unperceived    SCENE IV  Alicia Thomas  Thomas  For heaven's sake Miss Alicia tell me what have I done then to your brother  Alicia  In the first place the matter is that he is a little jealous on account of the squirrel that you have given me Then he thinks that he will curry favour with  our  papa in taking part in his quarrel with  yours  For my papa is very angry and I do not know why  Thomas  Nor I neither I only heard my father say as he walked about by himself I could not have expected this from Mr Crumpton He then went to find my mother and as my sister was with her then she must know what the business was  Alicia  In the mean time my papa has forbidden us to see you or speak to you  Thomas  What shall I see you no more shall I not be allowed to speak to you Ah how shall I part with you what will my poor sister do who is so fond of you Oh dear what have we done then  Alicia  Comfort yourself my dear Thomas we shall still be good friends and if we are forbidden to see each other who will hinder us to think one of the other Thus for instance when I play with your squirrel I shall think of you I will always call him by your name Oh how I shall love him  Thomas  How happy you make me in telling me so I do not know whether I should now grieve any more but here comes my sister She looks very dull  SCENE V  Alicia Thomas Grace  Alicia    running to meet Grace and saluting her    My dear Grace  Grace  My good Miss Alicia    Constantine appears at the bottom of the stage leading Mr Crumpton privately behind the summerhouse    Thomas    to Grace    Ah you are going to hear disagreeable news  Grace  And I bring you no better My father and mother are in such trouble  Thomas  Did I not tell you so Well what passed  Grace  Your father perhaps may be angry with ours but certainly his demand is something unreasonable  Alicia  Unreasonable that cannot be Ah if it were so I should still have hopes of persuading him Tell me however what is it  Grace  You know that handsome tuft of trees that is behind your garden  Alicia  Oh yes where we used to go in the spring evenings to hear the nightingale sing A charming little grove  Grace  You know too that this little grove was given to my father by old Mr Drury in return for his services to him during his lifetime  Alicia  Well  Grace  Well Mr Crumpton wants to have it  Alicia  What my papa  Thomas  What our pretty little grove  Grace  My father told him that he should be very happy to oblige him that he should never forget how much he and his family were indebted to him but that his friend had desired him on his deathbed never to part with this grove that it might always serve to keep him in his memory  Alicia  With all the respect that I owe my papa I cannot d  but he is in the wrong here But however he would not have it for nothing That is not his way of thinking  Grace  Oh dear no He means to pay my father for it and even perhaps more than it is worth  Thomas  And what does he wish to do with it Has he not a view of it as well as we  Grace  He wants to cut down all those fine trees  Alicia and Thomas  Cut them down  Grace  You know the hill that is behind the grove He says that will make a fine prospect Now the grove is at the foot of the hill so to have the prospect he must cut down the grove  Alicia  Ah now I see why he brought down an architect from town who talks to him about grottos and bridges and Chinese temples My father dreams of nothing but improvements He has a plan of them continually in his hands and talks of them a hundred times a day even to me And I who made myself so happy to see all those fine things shortly Ah I'll have nothing to do with them Let your father keep his grove  Thomas  What would become of the birds that chirp so sweetly on those venerable trees and who generally built their nests there because nobody disturbed them and we carried them food there  Grace  And the refreshing cool that we breathed there in the hot summer days  Alicia  And the echo that used to answer us from the hill when we sung  Grace  The prospect of a grove in full leaf is I believe as good as that of a hill  Alicia  And then what occasion has my father for a new prospect He has so many others on every side  Thomas  I should think that one of my own limbs was lop  off at every stroke of the hatchet  Alicia  No no your father must not deprive himself of his grove  Grace  Must not Ah he will not keep it long  Alicia  Why not My papa will never go and take it from him by force I suppose He has not the power  Thomas  But if he is angry with us and has forbidden you to see and speak to us I would rather give ten groves like that  Grace  And don't you think that I would too What should I do there without you Miss Alicia I should never have any desire to go into it  Alicia  My dear Grace we used to be so happy in it Do you remember when we used to go there in the evening  and tell each other every thing that had happened to us in the day  Grace  Yes and each brought her work You sewed and I knitted Then when Thomas brought us flowers we left off our work to make nosegays You gave me yours and I gave you mine That was enough to make us think of each other the whole next day  Thomas  And now that is all over never to return  Alicia  No we shall have no more such delightful moments It will make me grow sick and then my papa will be sorry and I will tell him that if he would restore me to health he must allow me to see my little friends again    They all three embrace and weep    Grace  But meantime the grove will be cut down it certainly must  Alicia  And why  Grace  Ah Miss Alicia I have not told you all About ten years ago Mr Crumpton lent my father fifty pounds to set him up and you know that my father has never yet been able to pay him  Alicia    aside    Ah this was the debt mentioned just now  Grace  If we will keep the grove Mr Crumpton will have  fifty pounds and my father does not know how to raise them Amongst all his friends there is none but your papa himself that could furnish him with so great a sum and he is the very person that demands it  Alicia    taking bath their hands    Oh if there be nothing but that I can settle it  Grace  Settle it  Thomas  You Miss  Alicia    with joy in her countenance    Do you promise not to betray me  Grace  I betray you  Thomas  Ah can you doubt but we will promise  Alicia  Well then hear me You knowI cannot think of it without being moved stillYou know how fone my mama was of me In her last illness one day when I was alone with her she called me to her bed side shedding a flood of tears she kissed me and taking a purse from under her pillow Here my dear Alicia said she take this I forbid you to let any one know that I have given it to you Keep this money for important occasions  You have a kind heart and a good understanding for your age it was mama however that said this You will know how to dispose of it worthily Your father has a noble and generous soul but is something passionate and revengeful You may perhaps spare him occasions of vexation or sorrow On so extensive an estate as ours there must be many poor people who have suffered undeserved losses such you may assist in secret You may also repay such services as may be done you without having always recourse to your father It is through your hands that I have for these two years past distributed my favours and my assistance I hope that you have acquired sufficient discernment to distinguish those who have a claim to pity In short I doubt not but you will make the best use of this little sum which I trust to your hands for the benefit of honesty in distress I shall think that I myself have done the good which you shall do and it is the best means by which I can be present to your memory" She was so exhausted that she could say no more but I shall ever remember this discourse as long as I live  Grace    wiping her eyes    Excellent lady  Thomas  My father and mother never speak of her but with tears in their eyes  Alicia  My mama had a great friendship for them too She told me at her death always to look upon Mr Garvey as one of my best friends and to follow his sensible advice in every thing You see then that I have obligations to you How happy am I in honouring mama's memory in satisfying my own gratitude in saving my papa from an act of injustice in sparing him the sorrow that he would feel for it in preserving every thing the charming little tuft of trees our own friendship the pleasure of seeing each other as before  Grace    throwing her arms round her neck    O my dear Miss Alicia  Thomas    taking her hand    My father will bless you in his heart but he will never take your money  Alicia  Certainly he will take it if I request him Nobody in the world shall know any thing of it Stay here my dear friends I will go for it  Thomas  I shall not take the charge of it however  Alicia  You shall my dear Grace And Thomas if you hinder her take notice I do not accept your squirrel I obey my father rigorously I never look at you again I never go either to your house or into the grove again  Grace  Well miss since you speak in that manner  Alicia    stopping her mouth    You do not know what you say I won't even hear you Stay for me I shall soon return If I am not interrupted I shall write a few lines to your father In case that I cannot join you again I will put the purse near the summerhouse there under that large stone Mark the place well now do you hear  Grace  I am sure that my father will send me back with your money  Alicia  Let him beware of that Besides you will not know where to find me for alas it is perhaps the last time that we are allowed to discourse together  Grace  Ah Miss Alicia what cruel words  Alicia  I must certainly obey my father But we are neighbours we are not forbidden to look at each other and whenever our eyes can meet unobserved  Grace  Oh mine shall take care to seek yours and to tell them that I shall never forget to love you  Thomas  Who will hinder us to be in your way when you go out to walk and then  Alicia  You are right A smile a little wink or side look can pass without being seen Come take comfort all will go well But where is the squirrel As I am going into my room I will carry it up  Thomas  Stop a moment I will go and fetch his house and carr it for you as far as your door    Runs to the summerhouse    Alicia  Good bye my dear Grace  Grace  Ah Miss Alicia I cannot believe that it is to be for ever  Thomas    returning in a fright with the squirrel's house    Bless me the squirrel is not here  Alicia  What my squirrel gone O dear Thomas  Thomas  Somebody must have opened the door for I remember to have shut it  Alicia  It can be none but my brother He was jealous that you made me a present of it and while we were  speaking here he slipped into the summerhouse and opened his little door  Thomas  If he only carried away the squirrel to play with him a little  Alicia  I know him better than you do He has let him run away  Thomas  Well stay he cannot be very far off If I can discover him upon some tree I need only shew him a nut to make him come down immediately I will go and hunt all about  Alicia    to Thomas    I wish you success in the chace my dear friend    To Grace    Poor Thomas I pity him he was so happy in making me that present  Grace  That is true indeed He never was at ease until he had brought it to you  Alicia  Well I must leave you my dear Grace I will take the terrace walk it leads to the house and do you go out by the little door of the garden and slip round along the wall You need only stand under my window without taking notice of any thing I will throw you the purse with a letter If my papa is not in my way I will come and bring them to you myself  Grace  O my dear generous friend what good nature    They go out different ways    SCENE VI  Mr Crumpton Constantine  Constantine  Well papa was I wrong You see what pains my sister takes to obey you  Mr Crumpton  And what is this story of a squirrel  Constantine  I did not tell it to you while we were hid because they would have heard us But here is the affair The dear friend Thomas made a present of the squirrel to the dear friend Alicia The dear friend Alicia received this ugly little beast with so much pleasure that she calls it her dear friend Tommy But I have managed so that she has not had much amusement with it  Mr Crumpton  How so  Constantine  They put the squirrel's little house on the summerhouse bench I slipped in there whilst they were taking a tender farewel I opened the little door  took the squirrel out and let him loose amongst the trees I saw him soon climb up into a tree and jump from branch to branch They will be pretty cunning if they ever catch him again  Mr Crumpton  Then sir you have done a very rascally action Did not I forbid you to molest those poor children and you knew very well the trouble that you were going to cause to your sister  Constantine  Since she disobeyed you did she not deserve to be punished  Mr Crumpton  Is it to you that the right of punishing her belonged Run tell the gardener and his people to look for the squirrel and to bring it to me  Constantine  But papa you forbad my sister any communication with Mr Garvey's children and will you suffer her to receive a present from them  Mr Crumpton  Was Thomas informed of my intentions when he brought the squirrel  Constantine  At least Alicia knew them and was not that disobeying you  Mr Crumpton  It belonged to me to determine that She certainly would have shewed me the present that she received and if I thought it proper I should order her to return it Again I say run and let this squirrel be found again or you shall answer to me for it  Constantine  But papa you have heard them talk finely My sister has money unknown to you and she gives it to Mr Garvey to pay you Should not I do better to go and watch Grace to surprize her when she receives the purse and to bring it to you  Mr Crumpton  Only dare to do it You know my orders Obey  Constantine    murmuring    I thought that I had done such fine things  SCENE VII  Mr Crumpton musing  Yes I see that I have suffered my passion to carry me too far What a pattern of friendship gratitude and generosity do these children shew It is true I had forbidden AliciaBut should I have forbidden her should  I suppress those sentiments in her heart to which I myself had given birth Could I deprive her of the only happiness which she enjoys in this solitude the greatest happiness of human life an amiable and virtuous society with children of her own age a blessing the loss of which I could not make good with all my fortune and for what reason to satisfy an empty whim My dear Alicia neither those grottos those bridges those Chinese temples nor all those ornaments with which I meant to embellish my garden nothing in short could have made you forget the unadorned grove where friendship found so sweet a retreat What a lesson is this to me But for you I was also going to lose a valuable friendship However you preserve to me the precious blessing You save me from injustice and remorse How your noble conduct makes me feel the unworthiness of your brother Ill  natured boy in what an odious light has he shewn himself But let me banish this mortifying idea from my heart I am impatient to know if Mr Garvey thinks as generously as his children The part that he takes will determine my happiness I have either lost a friend underserving of my attachment or I shall now find one worthy of me    Alicia crossing the bottom of the stage on tiptoes Mr Crumpton perceives her and calls    Alicia    She goes on Mr Crumpton calls a second time    Alicia come hither  SCENE VIII  Mr Crumpton Alicia  Mr Crumpton  Where were you going Why did you strive to avoid me  Alicia    confused    BecauseI was afraid to disturb you papa  Mr Crumpton  You were going perhaps to seek the squirrel that Thomas gave you as a present  Alicia  Yes papa It is true he has given me one I suppose Constantine told you  Mr Crumpton  You did not receive it I presume  Alicia  I noOh yes how could I avoid it Poor Tommy he was in such joy when he offered it to me  Mr Crumpton  You must return it  Alicia  Yes papa if I had it but it has run away  Mr Crumpton  Is this true Alicia  Alicia  Yes sir I assure you I can shew you his house it is empty  Mr Crumpton  Who could have let it out this was a trick of Constantine's  Alicia  No papa Do not accuse my brother of it The door must have been illsustened and so the prisoner escaped But Tommy is in pursuit of him and if he catches it again he will bring it back to me  Mr Crumpton  You mean then to have a second conversation with him What have you to say to him Have not you told him my resolution And have not you taken your leave of him  Alicia  Yes papa butOh I was so sorry I shall not easily comfort myself  Mr Crumpton  You find then a difficulty in obeying me  Alicia  Oh it is not that never imagine it But could you love me still could you own me for your child if I were to tell you that this quarrel does not grieve me What would you think of me or what would my friends think if I could withdraw my heart from them at once without feeling the least concern  Mr Crumpton  But is the offence offered me by their father so indifferent to you that you take no part in it  Alicia  Oh I do take a part in it and I would give any thing in the world that you had full satisfaction  Mr Crumpton  You know then what I ask of him and what he refuses me  Alicia  I knowI knowAh papa why do you ask me  Mr Crumpton  Because I would know if Mr Garvey's children are acquainted with the affair and have entrusted it to you  Alicia  Yes they told methey told me all Do not be angry papa  Mr Crumpton  Well what do you think of my demand Does it appear unreasonable Have not I a right to expect from Mr Garvey in return for all my kindness a slight compliment which I would repay him an hundredfold  Alicia  Dear papa I am only a child how can I decide amongst big people  Mr Crumpton  Consult your heart I would know what it says  Alicia  Pray excuse me My heart perhaps might say something that would displease you  Mr Crumpton  I understand It would judge no doubt that I am in the wrong  Alicia  Ah now you are going to be angry  Mr Crumpton  Only speak you will see  Alicia  I would not offend you for any thing in the world  Mr Crumpton  You will not only tell me freely what you think  Alicia  Well then I think that you are right and Mr Garvey too  Mr Crumpton  Both of us right Ah you little flatterer that is impossible One of us must be right and the other wrong  Alicia  Pardon me I spoke it as I think You have done Mr Garvey great kindnesses and are right to expect from him in acknowledgement a matter that you have so much at heart and he is right in refusing it you because he has reasons for not giving it up  Mr Crumpton  But are his reasons just or illfounded  Alicia  It is not for me to be the judge of them You look upon it as his duty in gratitude to give you up his little grove and he looks upon the keeping of it to be also a duty of gratitude You would cut it down to make a fine prospect he thinks it an agreeable shady retreat for his children You are his landlord and have power he has nothing but the prayers and tears of his family  Mr Crumpton  Enough of this you are too dangerous an advocate Well let him pay me the fifty pounds that I have lent him and he may keep his grove  Alicia  Then it will be force  Mr Crumpton  That will shew which is right Eh  Alicia  No papa I only meantOh I do not know what I would say But the fifty pounds where can be have them  Mr Crumpton  If you do not know neither do I However if he applied to you  Alicia    embracing her father    Oh I cannot conceal it from you any longer And though you were even to punish me for itI have deserved your angerI have  Mr Crumpton  Come come let me go What does all this mean miss  SCENE IX  Mr Crumpton Alicia Constantine hauling in Grace Grace  Constantine  Ah papa I have her I have her She has a letter I suppose for my sister Come give it to me or I'll search you all over Yes yes she had it in her hand as she slipped along the yewhedge  Mr Crumpton  No violence Constantine    To Grace    Do you want any body here child  Grace    confused    NoYes sir I was looking for  Mr Crumpton  Why are you frightened Well whom do you want  Grace  Miss Alicia  Constantine  But you know Grace that papa has forbidden her to speak to you  Mr Crumpton    to Constantine    I request you to be silent    To Grace    And what is this letter in question  Grace  It is nothingnothing    looking sorrowfully at Alicia    Ah Miss Alicia will you forgive me  Alicia  My dear Grace we must hide nothing from papa new  Constantine    to Mr Crumpton    How sir they speak to each other before your face Is that obedience  Mr Crumpton  Will you be silent Well Grace may not I know  Grace  Well sir since I must tell you the matter is that my father has w  t on a letter to miss here thanking her for her kindness    tre  bling as she offers the letter to A  cia Constantine      Constantine  O pap    t is full of money    To Alicia    Ah  you will be paid    Alicia  I was going  onfess the whole to you papa when Grace and my brother interrupted us I submit to my p  ishment  Mr Crumpton    op  ns the letter and reads    "  Most worthy Miss  "I SHOULD not be deserving of your generous intentions in m  favour if I were base enough to lead you into the slightest act of deceit by accepting the money which  you offer me in order to pay your papa No my dear miss I am his debtor and shall have the misfortune to continue so until I can acquit my debt by my own resources I am unhappy in not being able on this occasion to meet your father's wishes so chearfully as I would on any other If Mr Crumpton without mentioning it to me had pursued the course which his power enables him to use I should never have expostulated He may assure himself that I should not even have formed in my own mind a single complaint against him At least I should not have to reproach myself with violating the sacred promise that I have past Let him know these sentiments my worthy little friend His friendship and yours are more valuable to me than all the possessions in the world Continue still in the same generous disposition towards me and my children  I have the honour to be c"    Mr Crumpton without shutting the letter locks at Alicia    Alicia    running to him    Now papa you shall know how this money came into my hands and forgive me for not owning to you before  Mr Crumpton    kissing her    I know the whole my dear Alicia I heard your conversation I am delighted with the nobleness and generosity of your sentiments I do not blush to confess that perhaps but for you I was going to commit an action that would have made me unhappy all my life Here is your money Make that noble use of it which your excellent mother enjoined you Do not fear that I shall ever suffer it to be exhausted by your bounty Your little grove shall remain my dear children and friendship shall unite you still  Alicia    taking his hand    O papa I owe you now asecond life  Grace    taking his other hand    O sir what goodness Ah how my father  Mr Crumpton  Tell him my dear Grace that I request him to take his note again that I have a small alteration to make in it of which I will speak to him  Constantine  How papa you  Mr Crumpton  Hold your illnatured tongue You have given me today proofs of a very bad heart  Constantine  I have only obeyed you Must not children obey their parents  Mr Crumpton  Without doubt they must But when the commands of their parents are unjust they must then first obey their duty and their Maker If your heart did not tell you that mine yielded too much to passion I have no further hopes of you See how Alicia has acted  Constantine  But mama did not leave me any money at my own disposal  Mr Crumpton  Because she foresaw the improper use that you might have made of it And then had not you words at least of comfort for your little friends and for a man who had once the care of your education But what is become of the squirrel Have you given orders to find him  Constantine  I could see nobody in the garden  SCENE X  Mr Crumpton Constantine Alicia Grace Thomas    Thomas enters running and out of breath He holds the squirrel in one hand the other is wrapped in a bandkerchief stained with drops of blood    Thomas  Joy joy here he is I have found him here he is    perceiving Mr Crumpton he stops short    Alicia    running to him    O my good Tommy    he takes the squirrel    My pretty little Tommy have I found you Oh you shall never escape from me again Come sir march into your house once more    Shuts him up in his house and carries him into the summerhouse    Mr Crumpton  What is the matter with your hand my dear Tom I think I see blood upon your handkerchief  Thomas    with surprise and joy    My dear Tom miss do you hear that  Alicia  Yes child all is made up  Grace  Now we are friends for ever    Thomas jumps for joy and bows to Mr Crumpton Grace taking her brother's  and and looking at it with concern    Have you hurt yourself Let me see  Alicia  And on my account too  Thomas  It is nothing It was a branch that broke with the spring that I made to jump after the runaway I  ore my hand a little but I should have left an arm behind rather than not bring back the squirrel to Miss Alicia  Alicia  Ah how goodnatured Papa you must have it drest Nurse has an excellent salve  Mr Crumpton  That care shall be yours Come children follow me I will have a little entertainment prepared for you today at my house and I will go myself and invite your parents to come and partake of it I have been your scholar this day and I see by your example that welldisposed children may give useful lessons to their parents  VERSES ON AN INFANT IN THE CRADLE  Happy child the bliss possessing  Which calm Innocence

Amelia  Pray mama why so  Mrs B  I have no occasion I suppose to tell you my reasons A little miss ought always to obey her parents without allowing herself to ask them questions However to satisfy you that I have always a reasonable motive whenever I order or forbid you any thing I shall tell you Your cousin Henry can only set you an indifferent example and I should fear if you saw him too often that you would imitate his levity and indiscretion  Amelia  But mama  Mrs B  No reply I request You know that my orders must be followed punctually  Amelia retired a little to hide her tears and soon after her mother being gone out she sat down in a corner and gave her grief full vent Just then Nanny who was lately come into Mrs Barlow's service entered the room "How Mi  s Amelia said she are you crying What is the matter May not I know what troubles you"  Amelia  Leave me Nanny You cannot comfort me  Nanny  Nay why not There was Miss Sophy at my last service always name to me whenever any thing ailed her "My dear Nanny she would say you see what has happened to me tell me what must I do" And I had always good advice to give her  Amelia  I do not want your advice I tell you once more that you can do nothing for me  Nanny  Give me leave at least to go for your mama She will perhaps be better able to comfort you I do not like to see so pretty a miss as you in trouble  Amelia  Oh yes mama indeed  Nanny  I cannot believe that it was she who grieved you  Amelia  Who should it be then  Nanny  I could never have thought it I should always suppose you so reasonable that your mama could not refute you any request Ah if I had a child so well disposed as you she should be her own mistress But your mama loves to command and for a whim would oppose your most innocent wishes How can one have so amiable a child and take pleasure to thwart her I cannot express how I saffer to see you in this situation  Amelia    beginning to cry afresh    Ah it will break my heart  Nanny  Indeed I fear it will How red and swelled your eyes are You are very cruel to yourself not to let those who love you sincerely try to give you some co  fort Ah if Miss Sophy had been in half your trouble she would not have failed to open her heart to me  Amelia  I dare not mention mine to you  Nanny  Not that for my part I care much about knowing itOh it is perhaps because your mama make you stay at home while she goes to the play  Amelia  No she has promised me not to go there without me  Nanny  Well what is it then Your trouble seems to increase Shall I go for your little cousin You may play along with him to divert you  Amelia    sighing    Ah I shall not have that pleasure any more  Nanny  It will not be hard to procure it for you A young mi  s should have some company Your mama has not a mind to make a nun of you  Amelia  I am not allowed to see him  Nanny  Not to see him I do not know what your mama thinks Miss Sophy's was just the same She would never let her have the least intimacy with Miss Semple But how we contrived to deceive her  Amelia  How was that  Nanny  We watched the moment when she went out to pay visits then either Miss Sophy went to Miss Semple or Miss Semple came to her  Amelia  And her mama did not know it  Nanny  It was I that guarded against that  Amelia  But if I were to go to see my cousin and mama should ask Where is Amelia  Nanny  I would tell her that you were in the garden or if it was a little late I would tell her that you were gone to bed and fast asleep and immediately I would run to find you  Amelia  Ah if I thought that my mama would know nothing of it  Nanny  Trust me for that she will never suspect it Will you take my advice Go and pass the evening with your little cousin Never trouble yourself about the rest  Amelia  I have a mind to try it for once But you pr  mise me at least that mama  Nanny  Go never fear  Amelia in effect did go to see her cousin Her mama came home a short time after and asked where she was Nanny answered that she had been tired of sitting all alone so had eaten a good supper and was gone to bed  In this manner Amelia deceived her unsuspecting mama several times Ah much more did she deceive herself in acting thus Before she was always cheerful and took pleasure in being near her mama and would run with joy to meet her whenever she had been absent a moment But now what was become of her chearfulness She was ever saying to herself "O dear if mama knew where I have been" and she trembled whenever she heard her voice If at any time she saw her look a little serious "I am undone she would cry Mama has discovered that I have disobeyed her" But this was not all that made her unhappy Nanny would often cunningly tell her how generous Miss Sophy had been to her how often she had given her sugar and tea and how freely she had trusted her with the keys of the cellar and beaufet Amelia took pride in deserving from Nanny the same praises for considence and generosity She stole sugar and tea from her mama for Nanny and found means to procure her the keys of the cellar and  beauset Nevertheless sometimes she felt the reproaches of her conscience "I am doing wrong she would say to herself and my tricks will be found out sooner or later I shall lose the friendship of mama" She then went to Nanny and protested that she would never give her any thing again "Just as you please miss answered Nanny but take care you may perhaps have reason to repent it Stay till your mama comes home I will tell her how obe  iently you have followed her orders" Amelia cried and did every thing that Nanny desired her Before it was Nanny that obeyed Amelia but now it was Amelia that obeyed Nanny She suffered every sort of rudeness from her and had nobody to whom she could complain The wicked girl came to her one day and said "You must know I have a fancy to taste the pie that was looked up in the beauset yesterday besides that I want a bottle of wine You must go and look for the keys of your mama's drawers"  Amelia  But dear Nanny  Nanny  We are not talking about dear Nanny Do you mind what I ask of you  Amelia  Why mama will see us or if she does not see us God Almighty will see us and punish us  Nanny  He saw you all the times that you went to your cousin yet I never observed that he has punished you  Amelia had received good instructions in religion from her mother She was strongly persuaded that God has always an eye upon us that he rewards our good actions and has only forbidden us what is evil because it is h  rtful to us It was through mere thoughtlessness that she went to see her cousin contrary to her mama's orders But it always happens that from yielding to one error one fa  ls immediately into another She saw herself obliged to do every wrong thing that her servant ordered her for fear of being betrayed by her  It may easily be imagined how much she suffered in this situation She one day withdrew to her chamber in order to weep at her ease "Oh cried she how much is one to be pitied who is disobedient Unhappy child  that I am Slave to my own servant I can no longer do what is my duty but am forced to do what a wicked maid orders me I must be a liar a thief and a hypocrite Lord have mercy on me" Saying thus she held up  both hands to hide her face which was drowned in tears and began to reflect what steps she should take At length she rose all at once crying "I am resolved and though my mama were not to let me come near her for a month though she were toBut no she will be reconciled to me she will call me once more her Amelia I depend on her fondness But how dear it will cost me How shall I bear her looks and reproaches No matter I will confess the whole to her" She then immediately sprung out of her chamber and seeing her mama walking all alone in the garden she flew towards her and embracing her closely covered her cheeks and her bosom with her tears Grief and confusion stopped her speech  Mrs Barlow  What is the matter my dear Amelia  Amelia  Ah mama  Mrs B  What is the meaning of these tears  Amelia  My dear mama  Mrs B  Speak child what occasions this agitation  Amelia  Ah if I thought that you could pardon me  Mrs B  I pardon you since your repentance appears so lively and so sincere  Amelia  My dear mama I have been a disobedient girl I have gone several times to see my cousin Henry contrary to your orders  Mrs B  Is it possible my dear Amelia you who formerly feared so much to displease me  Amelia  Ah I should not be your dear Amelia if you knew all  Mrs B  You make me uneasy but trust every thing with me You must have been deceived You never gave me cause of complaint until now  Amelia  Yes mama I have been deceived 'Twas Nanny Nanny  Mrs B  What it was she  Amelia  Yes mama and that she might not tell you I have often stolen the keys of the cellar and beaufet I have stolen for her I know not how much sugar and tea  Mrs B  Unhappy mother that I am Do I hear this shocking account of my own daughter Leave me unworthy child I shall go and consult with your father how we should treat you  Amelia  No mama I will not quit you Punish me first but promise me that your love for me will one day return  Mrs B  Ah unhappy child you will be sufficiently punished  Mrs Barlow at these words left Amelia quite disconsolate seated on a grassy turf and went to seek Mr Barlow and they concerted together the means of saving their child from her ruin  Nanny was called up Mr Barlow after loading her with the severe  repreaches ordered her to quit his house immediately It was in vain that she wept and pleaded for a less  gorous sentence In vain she promised that nothing of the same sort should ever happen again Mr Barlow was inexorable You know answered he how mildly I have treated you and what indulgence I have shewn to your faults I thought that my kindness might induce you to second my wishes as to my child's education and it is you that have led her into disobedience and theft You are a monster in my sight Leave my presence and be careful to reform unless you wish to fall into the hands of a more terrible judge  It was next Amelia's turn She appeared before her parents in a situation worthy of pity Her eyes were swoln with crying all the features of her face were changed a frightful paleness covered her cheeks and her whole body shuddered as if in the convulsions of an ague Unable to utter a word she awaited in mournful silence the judgment of her father "You have said he in a severe voice you have deceived you have offended your parents What could incline you to follow the advice of a wicked servant rather than of your own mother who loves you so tenderly and desires nothing in the world so much as to make you happy If I punished you with the indignation that your behaviour inspires if I banished you from my sight for ever as I have the companion of your faults who could accuse me of injustice"  Amelia  Ah papa you can never be unjust towards me Punish me with all the severity that you shall judge necessary I will bear the whole but begin with taking me once more in your arms call me once more your Amelia  Mr Barlow  I cannot embrace you so soon I am willing not to chas  se you on account of the confession that you have made but I shall not call you my Amelia until you have deserved it by a long repentance Pay great  attention to your conduct Punishments always follow faults and it is you that will punish yourself  Amelia did not as yet fully understand what her father meant by these last words She did not expect so mild a treatment she went therefore up to her parents with a heavy heart and curtsying to them repeated afresh her promises of the most perfect submission In effect she kept her worn but alas her punishment followed very soon as her father had told her The wicked Nanny spread the most infamous stories concerning her She told all that had passed between her and Amelia and added a thousand horrid lies besides She said that Amelia by the humblest entreaties and by the force of presents which she had stolen from her parents had laboured so long to corrupt her that at length the suffered herself to be persuaded to procure her secret meetings with her cousin Henry that they saw each other every evening unknown to their parents and that Amelia came often home very late These things she related with circumstances so odious that every one conceived the most disadvantageous ideas of Amelia She was obliged to suffer the most cruel mortifications on this subject Whenever she entered amongst a party of her little friends she saw them all whisper each other and look at her with an air of contempt and an insulting smile If ever she staid somewhat late in a company they would say "It is plain she waits here until the hour of her appointment" Had she a fashionable ribband or an elegant dress they would say "Whenever one can get one's mama's keys one may buy what one pleases" In short upon the least difference between her and any of her companions "Do not talk miss they would say Thinking of your cousin Henry confuses your ideas" These reproaches were so many stabs to the heart of Amelia Often when she was quite overwhelmed with grief she would throw herself into her mother's arms and seek for comfort there Her mother generally answered her "Suffer with patience my dear child what your imprudence has brought on you Pray to God to forget your fault and to shorten the time of your mortifications These proofs will be of service to you all your life if you can profit by them God has said to children  Honour your father and your mother and submit in all things to their will  This commandment is meant for  their happiness Poor children ye know not the world yet Ye cannot foresee the consequences that your actions may draw after them God has committed the care of guiding you to your parents who love you as themselves and who have more experience and reflection to ward off every danger from you This you did not chuse to believe but you now experience how wisely God requires of children submission to their parents since you have suffered so much by your disobedience My dear Amelia let your misfortune serve for your instruction It is the same with all the commandments God prescribes to us only what is advantageous He forbids only what is pernicious to us We act therefore to our own hurt whenever we do what is wrong You will often find yourself in circumstances when it will be impossible for you to foresee how much vice may injure you or how much virtue may profit you Recollect then what you have suffered by one single fault and regulate all the actions of your life upon this unerring principle  Every action which is contrary to Virtue is contrary to our own happiness"  Amelia punctually obeyed the wise advice of her mother The more she was afterwards obliged to suffer the consequences of her imprudence the more reserved she became and attentive to her own behaviour She profited so well by this disgrace that through the prudence of her conduct she stopped the mouths of all who would speak ill of her and obtained the name of the  irreproachable Amelia  THE OLD MAN BEGGING  Mr Annes  ey    to a servant    WHY did not you make this good old man come in  Old Man  Sir I was asked but it was my own choice not to go in  Mr Ann  And why pray  Old Man  I blush to tell I am doing a thing to which I am not accustomed I cometo beg alms  Mr Ann  You seem honest why should you blush to be poor I have some friends that are so Be you of the number  Old Man  Excuse me sir I have not time  Mr Ann  What have you then to do  Old Man  What is the most important thing in this world to die I may tell you since we are alone I have not more than a week to live  Mr Ann  How do you know that  Old Man  How do I know it I can scarcely explain that to you But I know it because I feel it and that proof is sure Happily nobody is a loser by my death My daughter and my son in law have maintained me these two years  Mr Ann  They have only done their duty  Old Man  I was once just rich enough not to fear becoming chargeable to any body I lent my money to a gentleman that called himself my friend He lived merrily until at last he reduced me to poverty I beg pardon sir you are a gentleman too but I speak the truth  Mr Ann  I have as much pleasure in hearing it as you have in speaking it though it were even against myself  Old Man  I should have been wiser had I worked to the last but I was grown pale and withered and I looked upon this change as a signal from Providence to repose myself I never disliked work Sir When I was young that supported my health I had no other physician But what strengthens youth exhausts old age I was no longer able to work When I had lost my fortune I was desirous to work again I desired it with all my heart I felt for my arms but could not find them Excuse me for dropping a tear when I think of it No moment of my life ever was more heavy than when I felt myself so weak  Mr Ann  You then had recourse to your children  Old Man  No sir they came to me of themselves I had only one daughter but I found a son in her husband They made me welcome to every thing they had and took care of me although I had not sixpence to leave them May God Almighty take them to his heavenly table as they have taken me to their table in this world  Mr Ann  What are they become cooler to you now  Old Man  No sir but they are become poor themselves The floods have swept away their house and destroyed their flock so they have borrowed money to maintain me at case till my death the only thing that ever they did against my will I could wish them to have a sum for my  funeral beforehand that I may not be a charge to them even when dead It is for this reason that I come begging alms I am an old man but a young beggar  Mr Ann  And where do you live  Old Man  I beg pardon sir but must not answer that either for myself or my children  Mr Ann  Excuse my indiscreet curiosity Heaven forbid that I should seek to gratify it  Old Man  Sir I believe you In eight days look up to heaven you will then I hope see my dwelling it will not be concealed then  Mr Ann    offering him a handful of silver    Take this good old man and may God keep you  Old Man  All that sir No it was not my intention I want but a crown the rest is of no service to me There is no want in heaven  Mr Ann  You will give the remainder to your children  Old Man  God forbid My children can work they want nothing  Mr Ann  Farewell my good old man Go and repose yourself  Old Man    returning him all his money except a crown    Take this again sir  Mr Ann  My friend you make me blush  Old Man  I blush myself too Even a crown is too much to take Keep the rest for those who are to beg longer than I  Mr Ann  I feel for your situation  Old Man  I hope that heaven will also feel for it and for your generosity sir and repay it to you  Mr Ann  Will you take any food  Old Man  I have already had some broth and some bread  Mr Ann  At least take some provision with you  Old Man  No sir I will not affront Providence so much However a glass of wine just one  Mr Ann  More if you chuse my friend  Old Man  No sir only one I cannot bear more You deserve that I should drink with you the last drop of wine that I shall taste upon earth and in heaven I will tell from whom I received it Bountiful God even a cup of water is not without its recompense from thee    Mr An  sley goes himself for a bottle The old man lifts up his  hands to heaven    My last refreshment Heaven reward him one day who gives it to me  Mr Ann    returning with a bottle and two glasses    Take this glass my good old man I have brought one for myself too We will drink together  Old Man    looking up    God be thanked for all the blessings of this life    Drinks a little then touches glasses with Mr Annesley    May the Lord grant that your latter end be as happy as mine  Mr Ann  My good old man stop here tonight Nobody shall see you if you desire it  Old Man  No sir I cannot my time is precious  Mr Ann  Can I serve you in any thing further  Old Man  I could wish it sir for your sake But I want nothing more in this world nothing but a glove    looking at his hand    I have lost mine  Mr Ann    taking a pair out of his pocket and offering them    Here my good friend  Old Man  Keep that I ask only one  Mr Ann  And why do you not take the other  Old Man  This hand can bear the air It is only the left that suffers It has lost its warmth these two years    Puts the glove on his lefthand and gives his right to Mr Annesley    I shall think of you sir  Mr Ann  And I too of you O my good friend let me accompany you I find it hard to keep the promise that I gave you  Old Man  Then so much the better for you sir if you keep it    going    Mr Ann  Give me your hand once more my good old man It is full of blessings  Old Man  I hope to take you by the hand in Paradise  THE PLEASURES AND

complained that while he appeared to enjoy so much  himself he sought so little to contribute to the general amusement of the family They thought at first of requesting their father not to take him with them any more but a more gentle method of correcting him soon occurred They agreed together to hold the same conduct with him for some days that he maintained towards them One went to see Westminsterabbey another the regalia and armoury at the Tower a third the exhibition at Somersethouse but when they came home the accounts which they generally gave to each other of what they remarked were suppressed Instead of that mutual communication of the pleasures of the day which made their evenings pass so delightfully before a grave reserve and a tiresome silence took place amongst them Ferdinand remarked this change with as much surprize as mortification He felt the want of those effusions of communicative chearfulness which indeed rarely originated from him but in which he never failed to interest himself Accustomed as he was to reflexion he easily perceived the injustice of his own behaviour and soon became as free as he had before been reserved When he yielded to this amiable principle which is implanted in men by nature in order to connect and unite them by sentiment his heart tasted the pleasures of benevolence and friendship and his ardent desire of knowledge found new means of gratification from the lights which he collected from others at the same time that he imparted his information to them  A GOOD HEART COMPENSATES FOR MANY INDISCRETIONS  A DRAMA in one ACT  CHARACTERS  MR VAUGHAN  MARY ANNE  his Daughter  FREDERICK  his Nephew  DOROTHEA  his Niece  SERVANT  PETER  an old Coachman  SCENE  An apartment in Mr Vaughan's CountryHouse  SCENE I  Mr Vaughan  THIS is what one gains by taking charge of other people's children This Frederic how I loved him he was I believe dearer to me than my own son and the scapegrace now plays these pranks How could he change so far from what he promised in his infancy Such goodness of heart such spirit such chearfulness The courage of a lion and the mildness of a lamb One could not help loving him But let him never appear before me again I will never even hear him mentioned  SCENE II  Mr Vaughan Dorothea  Dorothea  Did you send for me uncle What are your commands  Mr Vaughan  I have fine news for you concerning your rogue of a brother  Doroth    turning pale    Concerning Frederick  Mr Vaughan  There read that letter from Richard or I will read it to you myself    reads    "  Dear Papa  "I am sorry to have none but disagreeable news for you however it is better that you should receive them from me than from another Our dear Frederick" Oh yes He deserves that affectionate name now "Our dear Frederick goes on very indifferently He sold his watch some days ago and what is still worse the greatest part of his school books and books of devotion I will tell you how I came to know it At a standing of secondhand books I asked the other day by chance for the Wh  e Duty of Man for as I had worn mine out by dint of reading it I thought I could not do better than to buy another The bookseller shewed me one which I knew immediately to be Frederick's I was positive of it as his name was upon the title page I bought it for sixpence but did not say a word about it for fear of prejudicing our schoolfellows against him I contented myself with shewing it to the head master who sent for the bookseller and asked him from whom he had that book The bookseller confessed that he had bought it from my cousin and Frederick could not deny it but said that he had sold it because he wanted money and that meantime until he should be able to buy another he had borrowed one from a friend who had two The head master would know what he had done with this money and Frederick told him though I suspect his account to be all a fib Oh thought I to myself we must find if he has not parted with some of his necessaries too I thought first of the watch that you gave him for his newyear's gift to let him see how his time went which was a matter that he minded very little as you may remember I asked him what o'clock it was He seemed confused and told me that his watch was at the watchmaker's I went thither that moment in order to be certain There was not a word of truth in it I expostulated with him as an affectionate cousin ought but he answered me that it was no concern of mine and that his watch was much better as he had disposed of it than in his sob as he had no longer occasion to know the hour for his business Who knows what he may have done worse for one cannot guess the whole"Well what do you say to this Dorothy  Dorothea  Dear uncle I own that I am as much displeased at my brother as you are Notwithstanding  Mr Vaughan  A little patience this is not all The best of the story is to come    reads    "Only hear what he has done since The day before yesterday he went out in the afternoon without leave Evening came on he did not return Supper bell rang he was not to be found In short he staid out the whole night and did not come in until the next morning You may imagine how he was received They asked him where he had been but he had invented all his stories beforehand And indeed though every thing that he said were truehowever he is to appear this evening before all the masters and if they do him justice he will be expelled shamefully or at least sent home What afflicts me most is his ingratitude for all your kindnesses the disgrace that he brings on us and the irregular way of life that he follows I cannot believe that he told truth in speaking of the place where he spent the night" And why do not you mention it "But I wish that he may It would be still worse and he would only be the more worthy of your resentment He threatens now to run away and go home" Yes yes let him come let him only put his foot upon my threshold he will see the consequence Let him go where he spends his nights As for you Dorothea I desire you never to speak a word to me in his favour They may put him in prison send him home expel him ignominiously it is all equal to me I shall never concern myself about him He may go to some seaport and ship himself as cabinboy for the WestIndies I have used him as my son too long  Dorothea  True my dear uncle you have been as a father to us and even our own parents could not have shewn more care and kindness to us  Mr Vaughan  I have done it with pleasure and take no merit to myself for it Your mother while I was abroad on my travels did the same for my children So it became my duty and I never to this day declined it but  Dorothea  Ah if my brother has forgot himself for a moment it is owing only to his impetuous temper You have had him long under your eye Whenever he had  done a fault his repentance and sorrow for having offended you always exceeded the offence  Mr Vaughan  Well and how many indiscretions have I pardoned him When he burned his eyebrows and hair with his fireworks when he threw a stone through one of our neighbour's windows and broke a large lookingglass when he fell into the mire and spoiled a new suit of clothes when he overturned the handsomest carriage that I ever had did not I forgive him all this I attributed these mischievous freaks to a petulance that did not however as yet shew a bad disposition but to sell his watch and his books to leave his school anights and lye out to fly against his masters and still to have the face to think of coming home to me  Dorothea  My dear uncle be pleased first to hear what he can say in his justification  Mr Vaughan  Hear  him  Heaven forbid that I should even see  I shall tell all my tenants to receive him with a good stick if he offers to come amongst them  Dorethea  Ah no Your heart could never consent to such harshness You will not deny the request of a niece that loves and honours you as her father  Mr Vaughan  You shall see whether that will be difficult to me  Dorethea  Will you have me think then that you no longer love the memory of your sister that you no longer love me  Mr Vaughan  You I have no fault to find with you and therefore your brother's misbehaviour shall never change my sentiments as to you But if you love me do not tea  e me with any more solicitations Study only to live happy in my friendship  Dorothea  How can I live happy while I see my brother in disgrace with you  Mr Vaughan  He has deserved it but too well Why not tell what he did with the money and where he lay out  Dorothea  It appears from the letter that he confessed both It is only Richard that will not believe him    Looks at Mr Vaughan with the tears in her eyes    Ah dear uncle  Mr Vaughan    a little softened    Well He shall have one chance more on your account I will wait for the head master's letter  SCENE III  Mr Vaughan Dorothea Servant  Mr Vaughan  What do you want  Servant  A messenger sir would speak with you  Mr Vaughan  What has he brought  Servant  A letter from the school    Gives him the letter    Mr Vaughan    looking at the superscription    Right I was waiting for this It comes from the head master I know his hand Where is the messenger Let him wait for my answer  Servant  Shall I shew him up  Mr Vaughan  No I will go down I wish to inform myself from his own mouth    Goes out Dorothea following him the Servant makes signs to her to stop    SCENE IV  Dorothea Servant  Servant  Harkye Miss Dorothea come here  Dorothea  What have you to say  Servant  Master Frederick is here  Dorothea  My brother  Servant  If he be not come yet he is not far off  Dorothea  Who told you so  Servant  The messenger that overtook him on the road Ah miss what has Master Frederick done  Dorothea  Nothing unworthy Do not believe him capable of it  Servant  Ah I never thought so of him Heaven knows we all loved him and would have given our lives for him He satisfied us for the least service that we could do him He spoke for us to your uncle whenever he was in a passion with us and he was a friend to all the poor people in the neighbourhood I wonder how his schoolmaster could be angry with him Ah I see how it is They were going to punish him for some arch prank and he being a fine spirited young gentleman would not be used so roughly  Dorothea  Where did the messenger find him  Servant  About a stage off He was sleeping under a willow on the bank of a little stream  Dorothea  My poor brother  Servant  The man stopped till he awoke You must think how surprized Master Frederick was on seeing him He imagined that this man had been sent after him to bring him back and he told him that he would sooner be torn in pieces than go with him  Dorothea  Ah I know his stout resolute way  Servant  The messenger protested to him that  he had such a regard for him  if he were sure to be scolded or even to lose his place for it he would not molest him He then told him his message and how they spoke of him at school  Dorothea  And what did my brother resolve to do  Servant  Although he was spent with fatigue he walked on by the messenger's side and they came together as far as the edge of our grove Master Frederick struck in there to go and hide himself in the grotto and there he will stay for the messenger's return to know how your uncle will take matters  Dorothea  Oh if I could speak to him  Servant  It is likely that he wishes it as much as you  Dorothea  My uncle often walks that way If he should meet him in the first of his passion Oh be so kind as to run and tell him to hide himself in the barn behind the trusses of hay I will go to him as soon as my uncle walks out  Servant  Never fear miss I will bring him there myself and help him to hide himself    Goes out    SCENE V  Dorothea alone  What troubles he continually causes to me yet I cannot help loving him  SCENE VI  Dorothea Mary Anne  Dorothea  Ah dear cousin how I did long to speak with you and yet alas I have but very ill news for you  Mary Anne  I know the whole My papa just now gave me my brother's letter to read That from the schoolmaster has redoubled his anger against Frederick  Dorothea  I do not know how to go about justifying him  Mary Anne  I would wager that he is innocent Do you know Richard's hypocrisy He does all the faults and is cunning enough to lay the blame of them upon others This is not the first instance of his striving to hurt your brother in my papa's opinion Twenty times has he by underhand complaints had him almost turned out of the house and then when matters have been cleared up he himself has been found the only person in fault I see even from his letter that he is a pickthank and that Frederick at worst has been only imprudent  Dorothea  What comfort your kindness affords me Yes my brother is naturally well inclined free sincere generous unsuspecting but he is also petulant daring and inconsiderate He is headstrong in his resolutions and loses respect for those that do not treat him according to his humour  Mary Anne  And Richard is envious dissembling hypocri  ical and fawning Like a cat that gives you at fast a paw as soft as velvet and afterwards strikes you with her talons at the moment when you depend most on her kindness How willingly would I give my brother with all his false virtues for yours "with all his imperfections on his head" The worst is that Frederick is not here  Dorothea  And if he were  Mary Anne  Ah where is he then Let me run to him I long to see him  Dorothea  His  I think I hear my uncle talking to himself  Mary Anne  Well you are Frederick's sister it is but right that you should see him first I will stay here  my papa and try to soften him Do you run to the poor wanderer and give him some words of comfort and hope  Dorothea  Yes and a good lecture besides I a Ture you for he deserves it at all events    Goes out    SCENE VII  Mr Vaughan Mary Anne  Mr Vaughan  I am so provoked with this boy that I have not been able to write to send back the messenger However he may stay here till tomorrow morning Let me compose myself a little  Mary Anne  How papa are you still angry with my poor cousin Is his crime so very great then  Mr Vaughan  Truly it becomes you much to excuse him I see that your head is no better than his and you would have done worse perhaps in his place Yet you have both of you a good example before you  Mary Anne  Who is that  Mr Vaughan  My good boy Richard  Mary Anne  Oh yes My brother is a boy of great veracity indeed very generous he is a pretty pattern  Mr Vaughan  I know that Dolly and you are no friends to him I myself from your opinions of him had conceived a prejudice against him but his master gives me such a good account of him today  Mary Anne  Nay did not all his masters quite sicken you with his pr  ises here They knew his father's fortune and people always hope to wheedle presents from a father by flattering him concerning his son  Mr Vaughan  I grant they may have flattered me a little with regard to him however from his earliest childhood he has never played me a single prank of the thousands that Frederick has  Mary Anne  His pranks never hurted any body but himself  Mr Vaughan  You would make one mad Did he hurt nobody but himself when he overturned my chariot a carriage elegantly gilt and quite new that had just cost me two hundred pounds  Mary Anne  It was but an accident imprudence is pardonable at his age Peter was trying the carriage and Frederick teazed him so much to take him up on the seat that at last he did After they had gone a little way he dropped the whip and Peter went down for it The horses finding the reins in weaker hands set off  Luckily the harness gave way and nothing suffered but the carriage  Mr Vaughan  That was not enough perhaps And who upon the whole has more reason to complain than I  Mary Anne  Frederick who had his head terribly cut but above all poor Peter that lost his place by it  Mr Vaughan  I cannot think of it yet with patience That fine adventure cost me above eighty guineas  Mary Anne  And how much grief did it cost the goodnatured Frederick He will never forgive himself for having occasioned poor Peter's disgrace  Mr Vaughan  Two goodfornothing fellows sit to go together I am surprized however that you pick out the worst characters and plead their cause Really it is a pity that you were not born a boy to be companion to your cousin I think you would have had charming adventures together  Mary Anne  Nay but  Mr Vaughan  Hold your tongue your teazing tires me I am going to take a turn in the garden Go find Dorothea and both of you come to me    Goes out without his hat    SCENE VIII  Mary Anne  I shall have a good deal of trouble to bring him about However let us not despair He is only illnatured in words  SCENE IX  Mary Anne Dorothea  Dorothea    half opening the door and peeping in    Hist  Mary Anne  Well  Dorothea  Is my uncle out  Mary Anne  He is just gone Where is Frederick  Dorothea  He waits for us on the back stairs  Mary Anne  You have no more to do but take him to  room  Dorothea  No that won't do Jenny is there  Mary Anne  Why cannot we bring him here Nobody comes here when my papa is out  Dorothea  You are right and it will be easier too for him to slip out upon occasion Stay here I will bring him up  SCENE X  Mary Anne  How curious I am to hear him tell his story And I shall be glad to see him too It is above a year since he left us Ah I hear him    Goes to the door to meet him    SCENE XI  Mary Anne Dorothea Frederick  Mary Anne    embracing him    Ah my dear cousin  Dorothea  He deserves this kindness indeed for the trouble that he has caused us  Mary Anne  I see him and all is forgotten  Frederick  My dear cousin do I find you then still the same You have never been so hard upon me as my sister  Dorothea  If I were as much so as your uncle ah then  Frederick  In the first place what does  he  say Can it be true that he is so enraged against me  Dorothea  If he knew us to conceal you here we should have no more to do but to quit the house and go about our business  Mary Anne  Oh it is very true Do not think of appearing before him yet awhile He is in a humour to do you a mischief just now  Frederick  What can our head master have written to him  Dorothea  A handsome encomium upon your exploits  Mary Anne  My brother had touched a little upon the subject by yesterday's past  Frederick  What has Richard written Then I have occasion for nothing more to justify me He knows the  whole matter as well as I for I entrusted him with every thing  Mary Anne  One needs only to judge of you from his letter  Frederick  Well if I be not innocent I am the greatest rogue  Dorothea  That is saying nothing You must be either one or the other  Frederick  And could you think me guilty What is my crime selling my watch  Dorothea  No more than that who can tell if your shirts too and your clothes  Frederick  Very true I would have sold every thing if I had occasion for more money  Dorothea  A very pretty defence truly and to pass whole nights from the school  Frederick  One night sister  Dorothea  And to fly against a proper chastisement  Frederick  Say rather against an outrage that I did not deserve If I had submitted to it I should always have borne a blot in the opinion of my uncle and if they had expelled me I should never have appeared before you  Mary Anne  But dear Frederick what can you say in your defence We should know it in order to clear you to papa  Frederick  Here is the fact Some days ago they talked of a fair that was to be in the neighbouring village Our master gave a few of us leave to go there in order to amuse ourselves and gratify our curiosity  Dorothea  Ah then it was for oranges and tarts that your watch and your  Whole Duty of Man  went or perhaps for a sight of monkies and tumblers  Frederick  Surely my sister must have a great taste for these things to suppose that one could spend money on them No it was not so I was dry and went into a publick house to have some beer  Dorothea  Why this is worse still  Frederick  Really sister you are very severe But do let me finish While I was sitting there  Mary Anne    listening at the door    We are undone my papa I hear him  Dorothea  Run run  Frederick  No I will wait for my uncle and throw myself at his feet  Mary Anne  Oh no dear cousin he is not capable of listening to you Do for my sake  Frederick  You would have me  Mary Anne  Yes yes leave me to manage for you    She pushes him by the shoulders to the door of the back stairs shuts it upon him and returns    SCENE XII  Mr Vaughan Mary Anne Dorothea  Mary Anne  Ah papa I see you are returned already from your walk  Mr Vaughan  I am looking for my hat Hang it I do not know where I have left it  Dorothea    looking about    Here here it is  Mr Vaughan  You could not think of bringing it to me  Dorothea  I must have been blind sure not to see it  Mary Anne  Who can think of every thing  Mr Vaughan  Truly you have so many things to take up your attention  Mary Anne  I was just thinking of poor Frederick  Mr Vaughan  Must I constantly have that name rung in my ear  Mary Anne  Well papa let us talk no more about him Would not you chuse to finish your walk before the dew falls  Mr Vaughan  No I will go out no more this evening    Mary Anne and Dorothea look at each other shaking their heads with an air of disappointment    It is too late Besides I have just been told that my old coachman is below and would speak with me  Mary Anne  and  Dorothea  What Peter  Mr Vaughan  Whatever damage he has caused me the mischief is done and he has been sufficiently punished for it I would know what he has to say to me  Mary Anne  He might very well wait until you returned from your walk  Mr Vaughan  No no I shall dismiss him the sooner After all    Mery Anne and Derothea whisper together      to Mary Anne    When your father    to Dorothea    When  your uncle speaks to you I think that you should listen to him After all    Dorothea endeavours to steal away    Where are you going Dorothea  Dorothea    confused    I have business down stairs  Mr Vaughan  Well tell Peter to come up    Dorothea goes out    SCENE XIII  Mr Vaughan Mary Anne  Mr Vaughan  After all I pity the poor man I never had so good a coachman My horses were so sleek that one might see one's face in their coats and he never embezzled their corn at the alehouse  Mary Anne  Ah if you had kept him you would have spared poor Frederick many a sorrowful moment  Mr Vaughan  Say no more of him It was he that occasioned me to discharge Peter and to be at present without a coachman for after him I conceived a dislike to all others I shall never find one to replace him  SCENE XIV  Mr Vaughan Mary Anne Dorothea and Peter  Doroth    Uncle here is Peter  Peter  I beg pardon sir but I cannot think that you are still angry with me I hope you will not take it amiss that I have made bold to wait on you as I passed the house and to beg you to let me have a discharge  Mr Vaughan  Did not I give you one  Peter  I never had any other than "There take your wages quit my house this moment and never let me see you again" You did not give me time sir to ask for a gentler discharge  Mr Vaughan  You did not deserve more ceremony from me after destroying my finest carriage I wish that Frederick had broke his neck at the same time  Peter  What can one say Sir A coachman's sense is in his whip and I had just lost possession of mine But I shall be wiser for the future  Mr Vaughan  Well it is all over How do you live  Peter  Ah dear master since I left your house I have never had a happy moment You know upon quitting your service I went to live with Major Bramfield Oh what a master he could never speak but with his cane lifted up rest his soul  Mr Vaughan  He is dead then  Peter  Yes to the great joy of his soldiers He never gave me his orders without swearing like a Turk His horses had their full measure of corn and his people plenty of hard knocks but not much bread  Mary Anne  Ah poor Peter why did you stay in his service  Peter  Where could I go What kept me there besides was that my wife found employment in the house in washing and mending the linen She earned at least half as much as maintained our children Every one trembled before the Major Death alone made him tremble and laid him low At present I am out of place and do not know where to lay my head  Mr Vaughan  But you know that I never wish any one to starve much less an old servant  Peter  Ah I always thought so but those terrible words "Never let me see you again" sounded continually like a clap of thunder in my ears Ten of the Major's greatest oaths could not have frighted me so much  Mory Aunt  And you have had no master find    Peter  Ah Mise it is not here as in London In the poor little villages about here people want their corn more for themselves than for their horses I worked at daily labour in the fields my wife spun and my children went about asking charity But we all together made so little that we were not able at the week's end to pay the rent of a poor garret Very soon we had nothing but the earth for our bed and the  for our covering My poor wife died of grief and hardship    wipes his eyes    Mr Vougean  You deserved it all Why did not you come and ask my assistance  Mary Anne    is Dorothea    Now my papa shews himself once more A good sign for Frederick  Peter  Ah sir what a woman it was Sure never was a better wise Whenever I came home at night without having earned a farthing and thought that I must go to  bed hungry I always found half of her morsel of bread left purposely for me When I foamed with rage like one in despair and would destroy every thing round me she always restored me to my calm senses and made me a reasonable man again Now she is dead and I cannot bring her to life There began my real unhappiness and heaven knows where it will end  Dorothea  Ah poor Peter  Peter  I had no more hopes of finding a service in these parts so I set out one fine evening with my little girl in my arms and I took my boy by the hand We walked a great part of the night and slept the remainder under a hedge Next morning by break of day we were in sight of a town Luckily there was a fair there that day I earned some money by carrying burthens But sir I must say it was an angel an angel from heaven Master Frederick  Mr Vaughan  An angel What Frederick that reprobate  Mary Anne and Dorothea    approaching Peter with looks of joy and curiosity    What Frederick Frederick  Peter  Dear master use me ill if you will but not that fine generous child I would rather that you should trample me under your feet  Dorothea  Oh tell us Peter tell us  Peter  My little Lucy went to ask a charity at the door of a public house Master Richard and Master Frederick were sitting there at a table with some beer before them  Mr Vaughan  Ay fine inclinations truly In an alchouse  Dorothea  Nay uncle he only went to refresh himself  Mr Vaughan  What business had he in the town at all  Mary Anne  He had leave to see the fair Your good Richard you see was there too  Peter  He presently knew my child and rose from table in spite of all that his companion could say He made poor little Lucy drink a glass of beer took her by the hand and leading her out heard from herself a brief account of our misery He then desired her to bring him to me and found me in the next street drinking out of my hat at a well as the heat of my work had made me dry I thought that I should run mad with joy upon  seeing him All shabby and dirty as I was I took him in my arms before every body and hugged him so close the folks were afraid that I should stifle him Ah he was heartily glad to see me too At last as there were a number of people about us he told me to lead him to a place where we might be by ourselves and I took him to a barn where I had already bespoke my bed for the night  Mary Anne  Ah papa I would lay a wager  Mr Vaughan  Silence Well Peter  Peter  I told him all that I have now told you The dear child began to cry as if he would break his heart I should beg for you cried he as I am the cause of your misfortunes but I will not sleep without relieving them Here Peter said he feeling in his pockets take what money I have about me I was not for taking it that made him angry I told him that it was money given him for his amusement and that as for me I was used to hardship He frowned and stamped with his feet and I verily believe would have hit me if I had not taken his purse  Mr Vaughan  How much was there in it  Peter  Almost a crown He would keep no more than sixpence It shall never be said continued he that an honest servant of my uncle's who has neither robbed nor defrauded any one shall be obliged in his old age to go begging with his children and not have so much as a lodging Take a little room Before three days will return and I will support you ever until I shall have written to my uncle We have both provoked him against us but he is too humane and too generous to abandon you to misery  Mr Vaughan  Did he really say so Peter  Peter  I can take my oath of it master  Mary Anne  Well well we can believe you finish your story  Peter  How do you employ your children said he as he took my Billy upon his knee Employ them said I they go about selling nosegays and toothpicks and when nobody buys they ask charity That is not right said he They would never learn any thing by that trade but idleness and profligacy You should make your boy learn a trade and put the girl out to a decent service  Mary Anne  Frederick was very right there papa  Peter  Yes said I but how can I offer the children to any body in these rags If I had only three guineas I could soon settle them There is a weaver hard by that employs young hands and would take my Billy if I could give him two guineas fee and a dairyman's wife would take Lucy into her service if she was a little clad Then I could go and offer myself for service in some rich family and not be reduced to stroll about like a vagrant  Mr Vaughan  And what did Frederick say  Peter  Nothing sir He went away but two days after he returned Where is the weaver that will take your son apprentice carry me to him So I did and he spoke with him privately for a while And the dairyman's wife said he that will take charge of Lucy where does she live I took him there too He left me at the door went and spoke to the woman in her dairy joined me again without saying a word and we came away After we had walked about forty yards he stopped and taking me by the hand My honest old friend said he make yourself easy as to your children He then pointed me to a shop of secondhand clothes that happened to be not far off where he had paid beforehand for this jacket and this great coatDon't I look like a squire in them  Mary Anne  O my excellent cousin goodnatured Frederick  Mr Vaughan    wiping his eyes    I see now where the watch went  Peter  That is not all sir Did not I catch him slipping money into my pocket I was positively for returning it to him and told him that he had already done too much for me But if ever I saw him fall in a passion it was them He assured me sir that you had sent it to him for my use And when I was for coming here directly to thank you he told me that you would not have it mentioned Ah thought I to myself Mr Vaughan was  so  good a master Perhaps he would take me again For all that I did not dare to come as Master Frederick had forbidden me  Mr Vaughan  O Frederick my dear Frederick you have still then that noble and generous heart that I always took you to possess from your infancy  Mary Anne  And what determined you at last to appear again before my uncle  Peter  The case was this They would not take my Billy without a copy of the register of his baptism and for that I must come here to the clerk of this parish As I entered the village I heard that my Lord Vasty wanted a coachman It seemed as if Master Frederick had sent good luck along with me I waited on my Lord who promised to take me if I could bring him a proper discharge from my last master I could not go into the other world to ask the Major for one so I took my chance though sadly afraid to apply to you And should you even refuse me I shall at least have returned you my acknowledgments for the relief that you were so kind as to convery to me through the hands of Master Frederick  Mr Vaughan  No honest Peter you are indebted for them to himself alone It is he who has stripped himself to cover you But he is also indebted to you for the return of my favour From what a misfortune you save him Yes but for you but for you so great was my resentment against him I should have banished him from my presence for ever  Peter  Say you so sir Then I should be the happiest man in the world What to save him from misfortune as he has me Each of us to owe that obligation to the other  Mr Vaughan  That sneaking varlet Richard had almost turned my heart against him How could I trust that knave who has so often imposed upon me But the head master of the school  Mary Anne  Why papa he must have imposed on him as well as you  Mr Vaughan  But bless me they write me word that Frederick is run away If he should grow desperate If any misfortune should happen to him  Peter  A horse a horse I'll bring him back to you if he were at the world's end    Going to run out    Dorothea    holding him    My dear uncle would you really pardon him Would you take him to your arms once more  Mr Vaughan  Ay though he had sold all his clothes though he were to return as naked as he was born    Dorothea makes a sign to Mary Anne and runs out    Mary Anne  What if he were here papa  Mr Vaughan  Here has any one seen him Where is he where is he  Peter  Ah if he was here if he was here I would jump up to the cieling for joy  Mary Anne  Well papa do you see him  SCENE XV  Mr Vaughan Frederick Mary Anne Dorothea Peter  Frederick entering kneels to his uncle Peter shews an extravagance of joy Dorothea and Mary Anne melt into tears    Frederick  Ah uncle my dear uncle will you forgive me  Mr Vaughan  Forgive you I love you a thousand times better than before You deserve it and shall never leave me again  Frederick  No uncle never never    Turning he sees Peter and takes him by the hand    Ah if you had seen the misery of this poor man and his children If you had been the cause of their distress  Peter  'Twas I 'twas I myself Why should I have let you climb upon my seat or have left you to manage a pair of fiery horses But who could refuse you any thing I could not though the carriage were to run over me through it So mark Master Frederick never ask me any thing improper again I should agree to it I know but I should go and drown myself directly  Mr Vaughan  Why did not you write me an account of all this instead of selling your watch your books and perhaps your clothes It was at least an imprudence in a child like you who knows not the value of things  Frederick  Yes that is true but to let this family be a moment longer in their distress seemed to me as bad as murder Besides as you had turned Peter away in a passion I was afraid that you should forbid me to assist him and that by disobeying your express orders I should make myself more blameable  Mr Vaughan  What then you would have disobeyed me there  Frederick  Yes uncle but in that only  Mr Vaughan  Kiss me my brave FrederickAfter all there is one article in the letter which makes me hesitate that is your lying out Where did you pass the night  Frederick  I had carried Peter the money that day Our master was not at home in the evening and I knew that the doors would be shut at ten o'clock I thought to be home before and so I should if I had not gone astray after dark  Dorothea  Poor brother where did you lie then  Frederick  I found an empty old shed and there I stretched myself upon a great stone and never slept so well in my life I was so happy to have relieved Peter  Mary Anne  Ah that illnatured Richard He took good care not to tell us all this and yet he knew it  Mr Vaughan  From this moment I withdraw my regard from him and you alone  Frederick  No uncle I will not be happy at the expence of another and far less at that of your son  Dorothea    taking his hand    How much ought I to love such a brother  Mr Vaughan  Well let him remain at the school you shall never leave me I wish to have you always near my heart and will have masters for you of all sorts if they were to come a hundred miles  Peter    making a low bow    My worthy master you are always the same  Mr Vaughan    patting him on the shoulder    Peter have you agreed with Lord Vasty  Peter  Bless your heart sir I had not my discharge  Mr Vaughan  You shall not need one I see I shall make Frederick and you happy in having you near each other once more but never let him mount upon your seat again We shall take care of your children too  Peter    sobbing and crying for joy    Dear master Sirare you serious Is not this a dream Frederick Master Frederick shall my poor childrenAh let me go and see my old friends in the stable  OLD COLIN  Mr Dexter Percival his son  Percival  PAPA I know a very good servant to recommend to you when you discharge old Colin  Mr Dexter  Who has given you that commission Have I any thoughts of sending him away  Percival  Would you always keep that old fellow I think a young servant would do much better for us  Mr Dexter  How Percival That is a very bad reason for being tired of a good servant You call him an old fellow Child you ought to blush for it It is in my service that he is grown old and perhaps the cares which he took of your infancy and the sorrow that he felt for your fits of illness have hastened old age on him You see then how ungrateful and unreasonable it would be to take an aversion to him on account of his age And do you think yourself any better founded in saying that a young servant would answer our purpose That decision is above your age and requires more experience than you can possess At another time I will make you sensible of the advantage that an old servant has above a young one in diligent and faithful service  Percival  I believe it papa since you say so But he wears a wig and it is  so  droll to see a man in a wig standing behind your chair at dinner I can hardly turn my eyes towards him without being ready to laugh out  Mr Dexter  That does not shew a good disposition boy I should never have suspected you of it Do you know that he lost his hair in a long and dangerous sickness To ridicule him is it not to insult God who sent this sickness on him  Percival  But he is always grumbling and is not so merry as the other servants  Mr Dexter  Colin may be serious but is not a grumbler It is true he is not so nimble as a young puppy of eighteen or twenty but does he incur your dislike on that account O son that thought makes me shudder  Then you will have an aversion to me too if God should grant me a long life  Percival  Oh no papa I am not so wicked  Mr Dexter  And do you think that it is not so to hate Colin because his age hinders him from being so alert as formerly  Percival  I am wrong papa I confess and I assure you that I am very sorry for having  Mr Dexter  Why do you stop For what are you sorry do you say  Percival  If I discover my fault to you perhaps you will be angry with me and I shall gain nothing by it but a punishment  Mr Dexter  You know child that I am not fond of punishing and that I try that method very seldom It is by kindness and good advice that I endeavour to correct your sister and you I do not know what fault you have committed therefore cannot promise absolutely not to chastise you Is it on those terms that you intend to make a confession You know my affection for you That is the only security that I can give you and you may depend on it with as much confidence as on my promise  Percival  Well papa I own thatI called Colinan old rogue  Mr Dexter  How Is it possible Could you so far forget how you should behave to an honest man And did Colin hear you  Percival  Yes papa and that is what troubles me most  Mr Dexter  It is very well to be sorry But it is not enough to be concerned for having affronted one of our fellowcreatures to his face one ought to feel the same sorrow for affronting him in his absence  Percival  Yes I am sorry to have used Colin ill at all but what grieves me most is that I treated him so before his face for  Mr Dexter  You have begun to open your heart to me Conclude  Percival  Yes papafor Colin when I used him so ill shed tears and said The pains and infirmities of my old age are not enough but I must moreover be the laughter of childhood  Mr Dexter  Poor Colin I know him well That ill treatment would go to his heart It is indeed hard at his age to be the laughing stock of a child But how much more must he suffer in receiving this treatment from a child whom he has known from his birth and served with an attachment that can never be requited  Percival  Ah papa how much am I to blame I will ask his pardon and be assured that in all my life he shall never have reason to complain of me  Mr Dexter  Very well child on this condition alone God and I can pardon you We are all weak and liable to be carried away by our passions for a moment But when we return to ourselves we must thoroughly repent for our fault we must force our pride to make amends for it and use all our resolution to avoid it for the future But I should wish to know what could make you behave so ungenerously to Colin Had he offended you  Percival  Yes papaAt least I thought so I was playing with my popgun and aimed to shoot a pea at his face Have done Master Percival says he or I shall go and complain to your papa His threatening made me angry and then I called him names  Mr Dexter  It was on purpose then that you strove to vex him  Percival  I cannot deny it  Mr Dexter  That aggravates your fault and that was what made him shed tears  Percival  Ah papa if you give me leave I will go to him this moment and ask his pardon I shall not be easy until he forgives me  Mr Dexter  Yes child we should never put off for a moment the performance of our duty I shall wait for you here    Percival goes out and returns shortly after with an air of satisfaction    Percival  Papa now I am pleased with myself Colin has forgiven me with all his heart and I do not think that I shall ever commit the same fault again  Mr Dexter  God forbid that you should Without his grace you can never answer for the firmest resolution  Percival  And what should I do for that purpose  Mr Dexter  Pray for his assistance He will not refuse it to you  Percival  I will pray for it from the bottom of my heart But papa there is another thing that I have just now done without your leave and which perhaps will make you angry  Mr Dexter  What is that child  Percival  The new crownpiece that you gave me as a Christmasbox I have given to Colin  Mr Dexter  Why should I be angry at that I am very well pleased that you should do good actions of yourself without acquainting me You may dispose of all the money that I give you It is your own and you could not make a better use of it We should early accustom ourselves to a prudent generosity Did Colin seem satisfied  Percival  He dropped tears of joy and I was pleased to see it  Mr Dexter  I applaud you for that sentiment my boy A humane heart always rejoices to soften the distresses of its fellowcreatures All the virtues produce joy in our souls but none fills them with sensations more delightful and more lasting than beneficence  Percival  Ah if ever I possess the means I will relieve all those about me that are in distress  Mr Dexter  My last prayer to heaven shall be to strengthen this virtue in your heart and to render you capable of putting it in practice  Percival  And shall I be every time so well pleased as today  Mr Dexter  It is the only pleasure that never grows weak Endeavour above all things to enjoy it in your family If your servants are honest people you ought to gain their affections still more by kind treatment than by money and at the same time not neglect to make them small presents now and then If you bestow them seasonably and with a good grace you will make your servants your firmest friends  Percival  But papa have they not their wages  Mr Dexter  They have them for their service no more But small presents will create affection in them and they will go beyond their duty  Percival  I do not understand you very well papa  Mr Dexter  Colin will serve as an instance to explain my meaning I give him his wages his clothing and his food for serving me When he has served me are  we not quit does he owe me any thing more At the same time you know he takes care of every thing in the house he has of himself undertaken the trouble of inspecting the other servants and has often saved me great expences He does all this through goodwill without any particular order because I gained his gratitude by occasional presents When your years will allow you to mix in the world you will hear nothing in every family but complaints of the negligence and ingratitude of servants Be assured my dear that the fault lies oftenest with the masters who endeavour to inspire them with fear rather than with attachment  Percival  Now I understand you perfectly and I will one day make use of your instructions and your example  Mr Dexter  You will never have reason to repent following them I inherited them from my father and shall always remember what he used to tell us on this subject  Percival  Ah papa if it be not too much trouble I should be glad to hear the story  Mr Dexter  I take pleasure in making you this return for acknowledging your fault and for your generosity to honest Colin "Captain Flood a brave officer who had retired from the service lived upon his estate with his wife an amiable lady and five children worthy of such excellent parents The inhabitants of the neighbourhood possessed the greatest respect for them and this family all together formed the most pleasing sight imaginable The sweetness of Mr Flood's disposition and the excellent order that subsisted in his house gained him the goodwill and admiration of all those who had the happiness of knowing him The young people in those parts were eager to be in his service and whenever a place was vacant in his family by a servant's dying or going away it was sought as a desirable situation Content appeared in the faces of all his people To see them one would have taken them for dutiful children round their father His orders were so just and so moderate that not one of them ever had a thought of disobeying him Harmony reigned amongst them as amongst brothers If ever they d  sputed it was which had most zeal in the service of their master and most attachment to his interests Mr Fulmer who was formerly an intimate of Captain Flood's  and had like him retired to his estate in another county stopped one day at his house in passing that way on his road to London After a variety of discourse the conversation fell at last upon the disagreeable circumstances frequently attending the care of a family Mr Fulmer complained of the fatiguing employment of watching over servants that he had never found any but such as were insolent idle or inattentive to their master's business As to that said Mr Flood I cannot complain of mine For these ten years I have had to weighty subject of displeasure I am very well satisfied with them and they are the same with me That is a happiness not very common said Mr Fulmer You must have some particular secret for making good servants and for keeping them in that perfection The secret is very simple answered Mr Flood and here it is continued he pointing to a small desk I do not understand you said Mr Fulmer but Mr Flood without making any reply opened the desk It contained six drawers with these titles  Extraordinary expencesFor myselfFor my wifeFor my childrenServants wagesGratuities to them  As I have always by me resumed Mr Flood a year's rent of my estate beforehand I make six portions of it at the beginning of every year In the first drawer I put a certain sum which is inviolably reserved for unforeseen occasions In the second what I intend for my own expences The third contains the money necessary for the domestic charges of the family and my wife's pinmoney The fourth sufficient for the proper education of my children The wages of my servants are in the fifth and in the sixth are the gratuities that I bestow them It is to this last drawer that I owe the happiness of having never had bad servants Their wages are for what their duty requires of them but the presents that I distribute to them occasionally are for the performance of what is not strictly comprized within their duty for services in which their affection to me outstrips my orders and my wishes"  ALFRED AND DORINDA  ON a fine summer's day Mr Vernon had promised to go a walking with his two children Alfred and Dorinda in a very fine garden a little way out of town He went up to his dressingroom to prepare himself and the children remained in the parlour Alfred delighted with the pleasures that he promised himself from his walk jumping and running carelessly to and fro in the room brushed the skirt of his coat against a very valuable flower that his father was rearing with infinite pains and which he had unfortunately just brought in from before the window in order to preserve it from the heat of the sun O brother what have you done said Dorinda taking up the flower which was broken off from the stalk She was holding it still in her hand when her father who had finished dressing himself entered the parlour How Dorinda said Mr Vernon in an angry tone do you pluck a flower that you have seen me take so much pains to rear in order to have seed from it Dear papa answered Dorinda trembling pray do not be angry I am not angry replied Mr Vernon growing more calm but as you may take a fancy to pluck flowers too in the garden that I am going to see and which does not belong to me you will not take it amiss that I leave you at home  Dorinda looked down and held her tongue Alfred could not keep silence any longer He approached his father with tears in his eyes and said It was not my sister papa it was I that plucked off the flower so it is I that must stay at home Take my sister along with you  Mr Vernon touched with the ingenuous behaviour of his children and their affection for each other kissed them and said You are both dear to me alike and you shall both come with me  Alfred and Dorinda leaped for joy They went therefore to walk in the garden where they saw plants of the most curious sorts Mr Vernon with pleasure observed Dorinda press her cloaths on each side and Alfred take up the skirts of his coat under his arms for fear of doing any damage as they walked among the flowers The flower that he had lost would without doubt have given  him a good deal of pleasure but he enjoyed much more in seeing mutual affection candour and prudence flourish in his children  THE FROWARD LITTLE GIRL  OYe children who have had the misfortune to contract a vicious habit it is for your comfort and encouragement that I tell the following story in which you will see that amendment is easy whenever one forms a sincere and courageous resolution  Rosalind until her seventh year was the joy of her parents At that age when the growing light of reason begins to shew us the ugliness of our faults she on the contrary had contracted one which cannot better be described to you than by the example of those snarling ours that growl incessantly and seem always ready to run at your legs and bite them If any one by mistake touched her playthings she would give that person a sidelook and grumble between her teeth for a quarter of an hour If any chid her though ever so gently she would start up and stamp with her feet and throw the chairs about the room Neither her father nor mother nor any one of the family could bear with her now It is true she sometimes repented of her faults nay she often shed tears in private on seeing herself become the aversion of every body even to her parents But habit soon got the better of her and her temper became more cross every day One evening it was NewYear's Eve she saw her mother go towards her room with a small basket under her cloak Rosalind would have followed her but Mrs Fau  k  ner ordered her to go back to the parlour Upon this she put on the sullenest face that ever she shewed and clapped the door to so violently that she made all the windows rattle Half an hour after her mother sent for her What was her surprize on seeing the room lighted up with twenty candles and the table covered with the most elegant toys She could not utter a word tr  nsperted as she was with joy and admiration Come hither Rosalind said her mother and read on this paper for  whom these things are intended Rosalind went to the table and saw amongst the toys a slip of paper on which she read the following words written in large l  tters  For an amiable little girl in return for her good behaviour  She looked down and did not say a word Well Rosalind said her mother for whom is this intended  Not for me said Rosalind with the tears in her eyes  Here is another paper said Mrs Faulkener see if this does not concern you  Rosalind took it and read  For a froward little girl who is sensible of her faults and in beginning a new year will take pains to amend them  Oh that is I that is I said she throwing herself into her mother's arms and crying bitterly Mrs Faulkener also dropped tears partly of sorrow for her daughter's faults and partly of joy for the repentance that she shewed Come said she after a moment's silence take what is intended for you and may God who has heard your resolution give you force to execute it  No mama answered Rosalind the whole belongs to the person meant in the first paper Keep it for me until I am like her you can tell me when I am so This answer gave Mrs Faulkener much pleasure she therefore immediately put all the toys into a drawer and giving the key to Rosalind said There my dear child you shall open the drawer when you yourself shall think it the proper time  Near six weeks passed without the least instance of illhumour from Rosalind She threw her arms round her mother's neck and sobbing asked May I open the drawer mama Yes my dear you may answered Mrs Faulkener clasping her tenderly in her arms But pray tell me how you have managed to get the better of your temper so I studied it continually replied Rosalind it cost me some trouble but every morning and evening and a hundred times in the day I prayed to God to keep up my courage  Mrs Faulkener shed the most delicious tears and Rosalind became mistress of the toys and soon after of the affections of all her friends  Her mother related this happy change in presence of a little miss who had the same fault and she was so struck with it that she immediately formed the resolution of imitating Rosalind in order to become amiable like her  This attempt had the same success and thus Rosalind was not only more happy herself but rendered those also happy who chose to profit by her example What child of spirit would not wish to enjoy the same honour and the same happiness  THE USEFUL DISAPPOINTMENT  ONE fine morning in the month of June Ambrose prepared to set out with his father on a party of pleasure which for a fortnight before had taken up all his thoughts He had risen contrary to his custom very early in order to hasten the preparations for his jaunt However just as he thought that he had reached the object of his wishes the sky darkened all at once the clouds grew thick and a violent wind bent down the trees and raised up a tempest of dust Ambrose went down every moment into the garden to observe how the sky looked he then skipped up the stairs three at a time to examine the barometer but the sky and the barometer were both against him For all this he did not scruple to give his father good hopes and to assure him that these unfavourable appearances would disperse in a moment that presently it would be the finest weather in the world and he conc  uded that they ought to set out directly to have the benefit of it  Mr Powell who did not repose a blind confidence in his son's prognostics thought it more prudent to wait a little Just then the clouds burst and discharged a heavy shower of rain Ambrose who was doubly disappointed began to cry and obstinately refused to be comforted The rain continued until three o'clock in the afternoon At length the clouds dispersed the sun resumed his lustre the sky its clearness and all nature breathed the freshness of the Spring Ambrose recovered his good humour by degrees in proportion as the sky brightened His father took him out a little way and the calmness of the air the singing of the birds the fresh green of the fields and the sweet perfume that breathed all round him restored peace and satisfaction completely to his heart Do not  you remark said his father to him the agreeable change just now produced all round you Recollect how dull every thing yesterday appeared to us the ground parched up by a long drought the flowers without colour and hanging their languid heads and in short all vegetation seeming to be at a stand What must we suppose to have so suddenly made nature appear young again The rain that has fallen today said Ambrose  The injustice of his complaints and the folly of his behaviour struck him sensibly as he pronounced these words He blushed and his father judged that his own thoughts would be sufficient to teach him another time to sacrifice without reluctance a selfish pleasure to the general advantage of mankind  THE PAGE  A DRAMA in ONE ACT  CHARACTERS  THE PRINCE OF    MRS DORFFEN  ELDER DORFFEN  an Ensign Her Sons  YOUNGER DORFFEN  Page Her Sons  CAPTAIN DERENHOFF  Her Brother  MASTER OF A ROYAL ACADEMY  ATTENDANT  The stage represents an antichamber in the palace Beyond appears a bedchamber with folding doors open withinside a camp bed at the foot of which on a stand is a lamp lighted and a watch  SCENE I  The Prince in a morning gown lying upon a camp b  d and covered with a large cloak The Page asleep in an armchair in the antichamber    The Prince    awaking    THIS is something like restThis is the happiness of peaceOne can no  indulge sleep without being aroused by the noise of a      Looks at his watch    Two o'clock It must be later  have slept more than two hours Page page  The Page    starting from his sleep half awake and falling back into the armchair    Eh who callsI'm coming presently  The Prince  Is any body there What no answer  The Page    turning himself and yawning    Oh dear I was in such a fine sleep  The Prince  I hear somebody speak Who is there    He turns the lamp and sees the page    Is it possible What that child here Should he watch by me or I by him What could my people mean  The Page    rising up half asleep and rubbing his eyes    Sir  The Prince  Come come my little friend awake Tell me what o'clock it is by your watch mine is stopped  The Page    supporting himself on the arms of the chair and still half asleep    Eh what sir  The Prince    smiling    You are fast asleep What a comical little face He would afford an excellent picture as he is now I bid you see what o'clock it is by your watch  The Page    approaching slowly    Watch sir I beg you highness's pardon I have none  The Prince  You are dreaming still or have you really no watch  The Page  I never had one  The Prince  Never How could your father send you hither without a thing so necessary and indeed the only thing for which in your case you have an absolute occasion  The Page  My father Ah if he were alive  The Prince  You have n  father then  The Page  He died Sir before I was born I never saw him  The Prince  Poor child But your guardian your mother should have taken care  The Page  My mother sir Ah does not your highness know  She lives very poorly indeed What money she h  d she laid out upon me but she had not enough to buy me a watch  The Prince  Who is your guardian  The Page  My uncle sir  The Prince    smiling    That is good But there are so many uncles in the world What is your uncle's name  The Page  He is a captain in your highness's guards and on guard today  The Prince  You are right I recollect him it was he that brought you to me My little man take this taper hold it fast In that bedroom    pointing    there on that side you will find two watches hanging by the glass Bring me the one that you find on the righthand and take care to set the room on fire with the taper Make haste  The Page    going    Yes sir  SCENE II  The Prince  What a sweet child what amiable simplicity Ah if there were a man like this child for sincerity and that man my friendIt is a pity that he is so little he will never answer I must send him back to his mother  SCENE III  The Prince the Page  The Page    holding the light in one hand and the watch in the other    It is five o'clock sir  The Prince  I was not mistaken it will soon be light    Taking his watch    But is this the one that I sent you to bring Was this on the right hand  The Page  Is not that it sir Indeed I thought it was  The Prince  Well my little friend supposing it was if you had known your own interest properly you should have taken the other for this set round as it is with brilliants cannot be proper for a child to wear Is it possible that covetousness directed your choice or are you like those who lose all by trying to gain too much Tell me  The Page  I do not know what your highness says  The Prince  I must explain myself then more cl  arly Can you tell the right from the left  The Page    looking at each hand by turns    The right and the left sir  The Prince    patting him on the shoulder    Well my little friend perhaps you distinguish them as little as good from  evil Pity that you cannot preserve that happy ignorance Go run and tell your uncle the captain to come to me    The page goes out    SCENE IV  The Prince  How ingenuous how amiable a childAn additional reason for restoring him to his family The court is the center of corruption I will not suffer him to fall a victim to it Yes I will send him home But where must he go if his mother be so indigent as he says and not able to maintain him I must enquire about it Derenhoff can give me every information that I desire  SCENE V  The Prince the Page  The Page  My uncle the captain is coming to your highness  The Prince  Well what is the matter You look quite heavy Perhaps you would wish to have a little more sleep  The Page  Why yes sir a little  The Prince  If that is all go and fix yourself again in your armchair I have been a child myself and know how agreeable rest is at your age Go seat yourself I tell you I give you leave    The page sits in the armchair and settles himself to sleep    I thought he would not need to be bid twice  SCENE VI  The Prince Captain Derenhoff the Page asleep    Capt Derenhoff  Your highness  The Prince  Come in captain What do you think of the little messenger that I sent to you What use shall I make of him to attend me in my chamber  Capt D    shrugging up his shoulders    I confess sir he it rather little  The Prince  Or to go on horseback on my business  Capt D  I should be afraid that he would never come back  The Prince  Or to watch here at night  Capt D    smiling    Yes provided your highness sleep  The Prince  What can I do then with this child nothing that is plain So that in bringing him hither you probably did not intend that he should be of use to me in his service but that I should to him in his fortune You told me I recollect that his mother was not able to bring him up but is it true that she is reduced absolutely to indigence  Capt D    laying his hand on his breast    Yes sir it is the exact truth  The Prince  And by what misfortunes  Capt D  By this very last war which has enriched so many others It is true her estate was something encumbered but at present it is taken totally out of her hands Every thing is pillaged burnt utterly destroyed Besides all this law suits they follow war as the plague does famine Happily for her her children are settled for the present The youngest is page to your highness the eldest ensign in your highness's guards As to the mother she lives as she can  The Prince  Wretchedly enough no doubt  Capt D  True sir    Coldly    She has retired to a cottage where she lives quite alone and retired I never go to see her I am her brother and could not bear the shocking sight of her distress  The Prince  You are her brother  Capt D  Yes sir unhappily  The Prince    with contempt    Unhappily and you never go to see her I understand you sir Her distress would make you blush or if it affected you to relieve her you think would cost you something    Capt Derenhoff appears confused    What is your sister's name  Capt D  Dorffen sir  The Prince    musing    Dorffen Had not I a major of that name in my troops  Capt D  Yes sir  The Prince  Who was killed at the opening of the first campaign of the war  Capt D  True sir He was father to the ensign and to this child a man of honour and perfectly brave He  mounted a breach with the chearfulness of one going to an entertainment He had the heart of a lion  The Prince  Of a man captain that is saying more I remember him very well and could wish  Capt D    drawing near    What would your highness wish  The Prince  To speak with his widow  Capt D  Your highness can do that immediately She is here  The Prince  Is she here send to her let her come to me a soon as she rises I desire to see her and to return her child to her  Capt D  Sir  The Prince  I forbid your mentioning it to her Go    Captain Derenhoff goes out    SCENE VII  The Prince the Page asleep    The Prince  What reduced to so distressful a situation by the war Dreadful scourge how many families has it plunged into misery Still however it is better that they should be unhappy by the war than by me It is necessity and not my choice that has made me take up arms    He rises and after walking about a little stops before the Page's chair    Amiable childhow he sleeps at his ease It is innocence in the arms of sleep He thinks himself in the house of a friend where he ought not to be under constraint Perfectly in nature    walks about again    His mother But indeed I should not concern myself much for her if she were like the captain I will put her to the proof in order to know her and thenthen it will be time enough to take my measures    He leans ever the back of the armchair and looking fondly at the Page perceives a letter hanging out of his pocket    But what is this a letter    opens it and reads at the bottom    "Your affectionate mother Catharine Dorffen" Ah it is from his mother Shall I read it I wish to know her character She will not dissemble with her own child Let us see    reeds    "My dear son The difficulty that you find in writing has not I see hindered your complying with my request  and your letter is even longer than I could expect This willingness in you convinces me that you love me I am sensible of it and thank you sincerely for it You tell me that you have been introduced to the prince that he has been so good as to approve of you that he is the best and mildest of masters and that you love him very much already"    He looks at the page    What my friend you have written so to your mother I only do my duty then in making you a return and in seeking to give you proofs of my friendship "You have reason to love him my dear child for without his generous assistance what would be your lot in this world You have lost your father and although your mother be still living you are not the less to be pitied Fortune has put it out of her power to fulfil her duty to you that is my greatest grief and the most cruel of my distresses While I had only to think of myself misfortunes could never affect me but when your image offers itself to my thoughts my heart is ready to burst and my tears never cease" Much tenderness much sensibility appears here and if she be as excellent a woman as she is a tender motherAnd why should she not She is I have not a doubt of it "I cannot my dear lead you myself in the road to fortune as I could wish I am obliged to remain here in solitude and retirement but I shall never cease to give you my advice with all the earnestness of affection and while my voice can reach you it shall constantly entreat you to follow the paths of honour and virtue As a fresh proof of that obedience which you have hitherto shewn to me I request you always to carry this letter about you"    Looks at the page    Well he has been obedient "If ever you should be in danger of failing in your duty or neglecting the advice that I gave you when I kissed you at parting and bedewed you with my tears then my dear son remember this letter open it think of your mother your unfortunate mother who is only supported in her solitude by the hopes that she builds on you" What has he not a brother "Think that she would die with grief were you to behave amiss and that you yourself would stab the heart that loves you above all things upon earth" She sees his danger She is right for he is much exposed here Ought the to have sent him hither "It is not suspicion or distrust that make  me speak thus Your behaviour never gave me cause for them No my dear child but your brother has made my tears flow you I hope will spare the feelings of your mother more than he has done" So then the eldestthe ensignI must inform myself more of this "You have always behaved with duty and respect I own it with tears of joy Go on my dear child become an honest man and your mother be she ever so poor ever so unhappy will soon forget her misfortunes and distress" Very well I like this woman misfortune exalts her sentiments instead of depressing them "You tell me at the end of your letter that all your companions have watches I know that you should have one too however you break off there and do not express even a wish for one This reserve pleases me and I am unhappy in not being able to reward it You know my dear that I cannot and therefore you will pardon me Business of importance calls me to the capital I am going thither and this journey will take from me what little money I have left It is a necessary expence and I cannot avoid it But be assured that in the end I shall do every thing in my power to satisfy your wish And should I even stint myself of necessaries I will never suffer my heart's best beloved to want an encouragement to virtue I hope soon to see you again and am" This woman is worthy of a better lot I will keep this letter and shew it to my wife But no it is this child's treasure why deprive him of it    He puts the letter into the page's pocket again    With what tranquility he sleeps still Heaven they say prepares the happiness of its children while they sleep    He takes him by the hand    Ho my little friend    The page awakes and looks at the prince for some time    He is a charming child upon my life Come my little friend awake It is broad day and you cannot sleep here any longer Rise  The Page    rising slowly    Yes sir  The Prince  You are fast asleep still Here go into my bedroom    He goes in    Put out the light and shut the doors Now go to that place where you found the watch Make haste not there this way Here straight on quick come back the other side Well are you awake now  The Page  Heigho yes sir  The Prince  Tell me for I look upon you as a diligent child and even clever can you write letters  The Page  Oh yes when I set about it I have writ two long ones already  The Prince  These two were to your mother I suppose  The Page    with a pleased familiar air    Yes sir to my mother  The Prince  Joy sparkles in your eyes when I speak of her    aside    What affection they bear to each other even in poverty But is your mother very good  The Page    taking the prince's hand between both his    Ah if you knew her  The Prince  I will know her my little friend  The Page  She is so goodnatured and so fond of me  The Prince  I could wish her sons to be like her Your brother the ensign they say he does not go on well But you  The Page    shaking his head    Ah my brother the ensign  The Prince  Yes they say that he causes your mother much trouble Is that true  The Page  Ah sirBut I was forbid to open my lips about it If his colonel knew    with an air of confidence    Oh that colonel is an illnatured man  The Prince  He shall know nothing of it I promise you Speak then what has been the matter what has your brother done  The Page  A great many things I don't know myself quite how it was I only saw that my mother was mighty angry about it and to hide my brother's fault she gave away all that she was worth in the world    He goes near to the prince and speaks low    Only for that she said he might have been broke  The Prince  Broke for what  The Page  Ah sir I cannot tell that  The Prince  What not to me  The Page  They would not let myself know that  The Prince    laughing    They were very right I think But as to you since you have not a watch I suppose you asked your mother in your letter to buy you one  The Page  Only once no more  The Prince  Oh then she was angry with you  The Page  No no sir so far from that she wrote to me that she would spare from the little money that she had and buy me one I am sorry that I spoke to her of it She can hardly live as it is That grieves me very much  The Prince  So it should A good son should not be an expence to his mother It is his duty on the contrary to seek all means of relieving her As to the watch if that were all one might content you    He takes out his purse    Hold my little friend here are twelve guineas that I can spare I will make you a present of them Give me your hand  The Page    holding his hand while the prince counts cut the money    Are they for me sir  The Prince  Yes certainly but tell me what do you think to do with this money  The Page  Could not I buy a watch with it  The Prince  Yes and a very handsome one but however when we consider the matter you have no absolute occasion for a watch There are enough here    While he speaks the page looks earnestly at him    If I were in your place I know very well what I would do I would lay that money out better However just as you please I am going to dress Stay here until I come back  The Page    calling him    Sir  The Prince  Well what do you want  The Page  My mother is in town She sets off this morning and I could wish to take my leave of her    coaxingly    Will your highness give me leave  The Prince  No my boy there is no occasion for that Your mother shall come to you for this time You shall see her have a little patience    He goes out    SCENE VIII  The Page  She will come here I shall see her here what can be the reason of that no matter if she comes and sees me that is enough One two three    counts all the money    Twelve guineas to buy a watch How happy I am I think I have it a ready in my hands I hear it click and wind it up myself But when the prince said  that he knew very well what he would do if he was in my place what did he mean by that what would he do then Ah he has watches in all his rooms so he does not know what it is to want one But he told me too that a good son should relieve his mother No doubt he was thinking then of mine Twelve guineas    looks at them    It is a great deal of money indeed a great deal of money If my mother had them they would be of great service to her    He presses the money to his breast with both his hands    Ah a watch a watch    lets his hands fall    But then a mother too and so kind a mother Yesterday too she was so dull she looked so pale and so ill I do believe that giving her this money would recover her at onceShall I go without it myself for her sake    With resolution    Yes I willBut let her come soon for I may change my mind I have the watch at heart still    Puts his singer on his mouth    Not a word I Hist somebody comes  SCENE IX  Mrs Dorffen Captain Derenhoff the Page  The Page    running to meet his mother    Ah mama  Mrs Dorffen    looks anxiously round without minding the child    I do not know brother but I am uneasy what can his highness want with me  Capt D  There look at that child He is going to give him back to you    She looks at the child with surprize and concern who meantime hangs on her quite joyful    But in fact it was nonsense to bring him here What can the prince do with him The other pages grow up appear like men and enter into the army But he    with a look of contempt    he is such a diminutive creature he never will be good for any thing The milk that you gave him was poisoned by your griefs He is a plant that is spoiled at the root He will never have strength or figure  Mrs Dorffen    sorrowfully    Oh brother  Capt D  In short when you see the prince be sure not to say a word to him of this child It would be to no purpose Rather solicit him in favour of the ensign He has some appearance at least he is a man  Mrs Dorffen  In favour of the ensign  Capt D  Yes he has sent for him  Mrs Dorffen  You frighten me Can he have learnt  Capt D    coldly    It may be so nay indeed it is probable    Leaning upon his cane and shaking his head    What do you think would be the consequence if he knew that the puppy meant to decamp and had taken up money and that it is only on my account who settled the affair    with vehemence    I tell you and you will see it I shall suffer for my own good nature and perhaps be put under arrest myself I wish I had never concerned myself about your children However I never shall again    as he goes off grumbling he turns back    No I never shall as long as I live    goes out    SCENE X  Mrs Dorffen the Page  The Page    seeing her concern    My uncle is always in a bad humour But let him talk on mama never fear  Mrs Dorffen  Be quiet child you dont know  The Page  Oh I know more than he does The prince is not what he says He never does harm to any body So far from that look look here    shews the twelve guineas in his hand    see all thatand it was he that gave it to me  Mrs Dorffen    astonished    Is it possible The Prince  The Page  He took it out of a large large purse that was full of gold a little before you came Ah if the prince chose mama if he choseOh he is rich I promise you  Mrs Dorffen  But how was this I do not understand it He must have had some reason  The Page  Certainly His watch was stopped He had been hunting all day yesterday and forgot to wind it up and this morning    he runs to the bedroom and opens the door    There mama there is the place where he lay So he called me and bid me look at my watch and as I had none  Mrs Dorffen  He gave you that money  The Page  Yes he gave it to me to buy one    Shewing the money again    Twelve guineas mama  Mrs Dorffen  Look at me Am I to believe you  The Page  Indeed you may But I am not in a hurry for a watch I shall have one some time or other    taking his mother's hand    Take this money mama Put it into your purse  Mrs Dorffen    with emotion    What my dear How  The Page  I am so sorry to see you always crying Ah mama I wish I had a great deal of money then you should never cry any more All yes every farthing you should have and welcome  Mrs Dorffen    leaning over him    What you would my dear  The Page  How pleased I'd be to see you happy and contented  Mrs Dorffen    kissing him    I am happy my love I would not give the happiness that I feel this moment for all your prince's gold Ah you do not know how the compassionate tenderness of a son impresses the heart of an unfortunate mother  The Page    taking his mother's hand again    But you will take this money though I beg you my dear mama not to refuse me  Mrs Dorffen  Yes my dear I will take it As others may impose upon you I shall take care to  The Page  To do what to buy me a watch  Mrs Dorffen  Why if you remain with the prince you will want one  The Page  Oh no no The prince has watches in every room He told me himself that I should not want one  Mrs Dorffen  But what he has given you was to buy one  The Page  That is what he told me however  Mrs Dorffen  You are deceiving me my dear and even your fondness for your mother should not make you tell a story  The Page  A story Then you do not believe me Now I wish that his highness were here I wish he would come    turning about    Ah here he is himself  SCENE XI  The Prince Mrs Dorffen the Page  The Page    running to meet the Prince    Is not it true sir that you gave me twelve guineas at first to buy a watch  The Prince    smiling    Yes my man  The Page  And did not you tell me afterwards that I should not want one  The Prince  Yes that is true too  The Page    turning immediately towards his mother    Well mama now  Mrs Dorffen    confused    Your highness will be so good as to excuse the simplicity of a child who forgets the respect  The Prince  Excuse it madam that simplicity delights me and I could wish to find it in every body it is so agreeable to nature Well my man your mother would not believe you then  The Page    looking a little vexed    No sir At first she would not believe me and afterwards she would not accept the money  The Prince  What do you say accept Why have you thought so little of my present as to give it away again I cannot suppose that  The Page    hesitating    Sir  The Prince  If I thought so I should not be very ready to give you more Come then tell me the truth is it so  The Page    pointing to his mother    Ah sir my mama is so poor  The Prince    chucking him under the chin    Good little soul Have you given up then the only object of your wishes in order to relieve your mother It would be very hard indeed that you should lose a watch for doing so    He takes out his own    There if I had but this single watch I would give it to you to reward your affection  The Page    taking it joyfully    Ah sir But does it go  The Prince  Never fear it goes very well    The Page runs to his mother to shew her the watch    The Prince  Come my little friend put up your watch And since you have made so good use of the little that I gave you    gives him his purse    here take this There are a hundred guineas instead of the first twelve  The Page    looking at him with astonishment    Sir  The Prince  Do you hesitate Here take them  The Page  What the purse sir and all that is    Going to return it    Indeed it is too much  The Prince  Yes for yourself But I give it to you that you may dispose of it And who do you think wants it most  The Page  Who wants it    Looks at the Prince and his mother by turns    There mama take it  Mrs Dorffen    coming forward towards the Prince    Your highness  The Prince  Pray no acknowledgements madam You will find that it is very little and I fear it may be of more harm to you than advantage But    pointing to the Page    I need not tell you that this child is too weak and too little for my service At his age children are hardly able to do much for others In short I hope you will have no objection to take him back again You are silent  Mrs Dorffen  Your highness will excuse  The Prince  What  Mrs Dorffen  I own sir I am wrong to blush for a poverty which I did not bring upon myself and I may without disgrace ingenuously confess it to my sovereign    Coming nearer and looking stedfastly at him    Yes fir my circumstances are too narrow to maintain and bring up my son I have long looked forward to the future with an anxious eye and now my fears are real I shall be the victim of grief Ah if I must carry back with me into the sorrowful retreat of misery this child that your highness returns to me who is the only object of all my concern this child who is too young as yet    endeavouring to contain her tears    tofeel the loss of a father Ah pardon a mother's weakness  The Page    taking the Prince's hand    sorrowfully  Mama is crying sir  The Prince  Well supposing that you were to live with your mother  The Page    with a look of entreaty    Your highness won't send me home  The Prince  No Do you think not This considence my little friend pleases me Madam he may stay And yet it would be a pity if his morals his innocenceBut no There is nothing to fear as yet  Mrs Dorffen    looking at him attentively    His innocence did your highness say  The Prince  There is no fear madam You would imagine perhaps that I wish to draw back my word But don't be uneasy  Mrs Dorffen    fearfully    Yet might I take the liberty without breaking through the respect that I owe your highness to request you to explain yourself  The Prince  Madam what I meant was this I have for some time past been extremely dissatisfied with my pages Their company and example might perhapsYet after all it is but a perhaps and one may try  Mrs Dorffen    eagerly seizing her son's hand    No sir  The Prince    affecting displeasure    No As you please madam  Mrs Dorffen  My son's innocence is too dear to me I shudder at the dangers to which I was going to expose him  The Prince  But consider  Mrs Dorffen  I consider nothing I see my son in the midst of the flames and if I can but save him no matter though he should be naked  The Prince  But without fortune without education madam what will become of him  Mrs Dorffen  Whatever it shall please heaven I submit to the divine will If he cannot support his birth let him go labour in the fields let him die in poverty but retain his innocence  The Prince    in his natural manner    This is thinking nobly Yes madam I see you deserve every thing that I can possibly do for you    Coming nearer to her and speaking with earnestness    In what can I be of assistance to you Tell me how I can serve you Only speak you see a friend before you  Mrs Dorffen    with emotion    Ah sir  The Prince  Tell me first of all what is your situation How are you with regard to your estate  Mrs Dorffen  It will be absolutely impossible sir for me to save it  The Prince  Your debts then are pretty considerable You are at law now I am told Do not they give you any hopes  Mrs Dorffen  None sir One cause concerning a small inheritance should have been decided long ago in my favour My title is indisputable But interest and money are against it Necessity brought me hither to town in order to endeavour a compromise but I could not succeed  The Prince  So much the better You shall have justice now without making any sacrifice I give you my word of honour and accept moreover a pension of a hundred a year I hope that it will put you above every necessity  Mrs Dorffen    throwing herself at his feet    Oh sir so much goodness how shall I  The Prince    raising her    What are you doing madam Rise I request you I only discharge what I owe to the memory of a man whose widow you are I do for you no more than I would do for any one whose virtue I esteemed Tell me would you still hesitate to take back your child  Mrs Dorffen  Sir could I so forget  The Prince  And you my little friend would you like to go back with your mother  The Page    playing with his watch    With my mother Yes sir  The Prince  And yet now I know that you love me would not you like as well to stay with me  The Page  Yes very well sir  The Prince  Now if that be so were I to give you back to your mother it would be sending you away from me and you have asked me so earnestly to keep you here Besides your mother has thrown you into my arms I must therefore take another way to settle matters Stop here madam I shall be with you in a moment  SCENE XII  Mrs Dorffen the Page  Mrs Dorffen    throwing herself into an arm chair    O blessed day O unexpected happiness  The Page  Well mama well are you glad  Mrs Dorffen    drawing him to her affectionately    O my son my dear son  The Page  But you do not rejoice You ought to be merrier mama  Mrs Dorffen  Even my happiness makes me blush It reproaches me for the little trust that I had in Providence and for the sorrow that I felt when you came into the world It was but a moment after I had heard of the loss of your father I looked at you with pity and lamented that you ever saw the light    She takes him in her arms and kisses him    Yet it was you that was to relieve your unfortunate mother your young hands were to dry up her tears O heaven what can I now desire more Nothing nothing but to be sure of your brother's lot and then my happiness would be complete  The Page  My brother's Why mama what of him  Mrs Dorffen  If the prince knew what he has done  The Prince  And if he did there would be nothing of it You saw how good and how generous he is  Mrs Dorffen  To us my dear who are not guilty of any crime  The Page  Besides he promised me that he would not tell and that the colonel should know nothing of it  Mrs Dorffen    frightened    What he promised you  The Page  Yes indeed so you need not be afraid  Mrs Dorffen  I am thunderstruck You have told him then  The Page  Nay hardly any thing Only all that I knew And then he asked me concerning my brother's behaviour and so I could not tell a fib You know you bid me never to do so  Mrs Dorffen  But my dear child  The Page  Why mama are you uneasy  Mrs Dorffen  Uneasy O heavens can you ask Oh if the prince should enquire farther if he should be informedYou may ruin your mother and your brother you may plunge us all into the deepest misery  The Page    ready to cry    The deepest misery  Mrs Dorffen  Somebody comes    She kisses and encourages him    Say not a word Dry up your tears They will only perhaps make the matter worse Do not be uneasy  SCENE XIII  Mrs Dorffen the Page the Prince followed by Captain Derenhoff and Ensign Dorffen  The Prince  Come in gentlemen    To the Ensign    You are ensign Dorffen then the son of that brave Major  Ensign Dorffen    bowing very low    Yes sir  The Prince  That is a great recommendation with me Your father was a man of honour and a brave officer I have no doubt but his example rouses your emulation and that you strive to make yourself worthy of him  Ensign Dorffen  Sir I only do my duty  The Prince  That is doing every thing The bravest man can do no more There sir is your mother her virtues and the hopes that may be formed of this amiable child have given me the most favourable idea of your family and therefore I wished to see you all assembled here  Ensign Dorffen    still bowing    Your highness does me particular honour  The Prince  No more certainly than you deserve  Ensign Dorffen  Your highness judges favourably of me  The Prince  Really sir I only want to be confirmed in the opinion that I am tempted to form of you at present in order to make your fortune and yet that air of freedom and confidence that becomes you so well  Ensign Dorffen  Ah sir  The Prince  Denotes permit me to say a heart either very noble or very corrupt The son of such parents cannot be suspected Certainly not Therefore sir what can we do to serve you A step higher would not advance you much in rank What think you  Ensign Dorffen    rubbing his hands    No certainly sir  The Prince  Now if we were to pass over this step A Company the rank of captain It is the main object with you young gentlemen But first    turning short round to Capt Derenhoff    Sir what is your opinion of your nephew  Capt Derenhoff    something confused    Mine sir My opinion  The Prince  One would think it to be unfavourable  Capt Derenhoff  No sir rather much the contrary I believe that he has courage and will be a brave  The Prince    looking with satisfaction at ensign Dorffen    Ay is that true  Capt Derenhoff  Besides he has a promising figure  The Prince  He is a fine lad I confess But his behaviour his morals I am ashamed indeed to ask you about such trifles In short what is his character  Capt Derenhoff    smiling    Oh a little too airy sometimes petulant After all sir you know that does not misbecome a soldier  The Prince  I know Really that is something new to me I want now madam only your testimony What will you say of your son    After a pause    Nothing  Mrs Dorffen  What should I say of him  The Prince  What you think The truth  Mrs Dorffen  But can I sir If I had reason to praise him would you wish me to do it in his presence or should I speak to his prejudice before him who can determine his fortune  The Prince    smiling    Excellent madam To the fondness of a mother you join the address of a woman I cannot but admire you    In a serious tone    Sir every one has his way I have mine when I mean to advance an officer I begin with putting him under arrest What do you think of it  Ensign Dorffen    frightened    Sir  The Prince  Yes that is my manner Give up your sword to the captain An air of more modesty would have excused all But this confidence this undaunted to  eWhat can be expected from a person who with your conscience is master of such assurance who should be sensible that he has deserved my displeasure who knows how unworthily he has treated the best of mothers and who neverthelessSir let him be confined for a month I will have no explanation upon what is past and that on your account madam and because of the manner in which I came by my information but particularly because  circumstances make me presume that his fault is of a weighty nature    With a severe and determined voice    Captain if hereafter any thing should happen I desire to be informed of it immediately you understand immediately I mean to advance this young man and neither you    to the captain    nor    in a gentler tone    you madam shall make me alter my planNever give him any thing never the smallest trifle by way of present His pay may serve him and let him learn to contract his expences    Making a sign with his hand    Go sir to your confinement    The two officers go out    SCENE XIV  The Prince Mrs Dorffen the Page  The Prince  Well madam you seem dejected  Mrs Dorffen    respectfully    Sir I am a mother  The Prince  But you are not one of those weak mothers who to spare their children a slight mortification chuse not to correct them  Mrs Dorffen  That would be a very false tenderness No sir I only fear that he may have lost for ever his prince's favour  The Prince  Do not be uneasy madam My design is barely to make him worthy of the favours that I mean to bestow on him His youth claims some indulgence therefore I excuse his levities and indiscretion but I shall not always do so What in one person brings back the love of virtue along with repentance will in another strengthen his inclination to vice Upon the whole make yourself easy The young gentleman will come to himself and I shall proportion my favour to his improvement    Turning to the page    As to this child do you know what my intentions are  Mrs Dorffen  Whatever they are sir they will only aim to secure his happiness O sir I have never let pass a day without paying to your virtues the tribute of my homage but I now see how far it fell below them  The Prince  What would you say madam You do not know me My object is to give the state a worthy  member and myself a faithful servant and to raise up for my son a friend who may one day be ready to sacrifice his life for him as his father has done for me  SCENE XV  The Prince Mrs Dorffen the Page Attendant  Attendant  Please your highness the Master of the Royal Academy  The Prince  Let him come in I hope madam that you need only to be informed of my intentions to approve them  SCENE XVI  The Prince Mrs Dorffen the Page the Master of the Academy  The Master    bowing    I am come according to your highness's orders  The Prince  Your servant sir I am glad to see you What do children of the first condition pay at the Royal Academy  The Master  Of the first condition sir That is a  parents agree  The Prince  However mention the terms  The Master  Sixty pounds sir  The Prince  Very well This child I mean to send to you And as I shall be instead of a father to him I propose to do as much for him as the best gentlemen do for their children But tell me who has the care of attending to these young persons for that is the essential point  The Master  The different masters sir  The Prince  Who are I suppose qualified for their employment But I do not know them It is on you alone sir that I wish to depend You have gained my confidence Would you be so good as to take this child particularly under your own care  The Master  Sir it is my duty  The Prince  I do not mean to make it a duty to you Will it be agreeable  The Master  Sir my duty is always agreeable to me  The Prince  Very well You may depend then on my gratitude    To the Page as he takes him by the hand    Come hither my man do you see this gentleman he is mild and goodnatured would you like to go and live with him  The Page    after looking a moment at the master    Yes sir  The Prince  But observe you are to look upon this gentleman as your master as your benefactor You are to shew him the greatest obedience and the most dutiful respect and if ever he has reason to complain of you  The Page  Oh sir he never shall  The Prince  You have seen that I can be as severe as I am gentle So that at the smallest complaint  The Page    bowing respectfully to the master    I hope sir you shall never have reason to complain of me  The Prince  How do you like this child  The Master  It is enough sir that I receive him from your hands that will make him always dear to me as my own son  The Prince  Well then he may go with you You have no objection madam  Mrs Dorffen  Heavens sir objection  The Prince  Go then my dear and never quit the paths of virtue and honour I have only to add that you may make yourself easy you shall never want But why so dull  The Page    taking the prince's hand    I wish your highness all happiness  The Prince    tenderly    And I you the same my good little friend God bless you my dear How grateful his heart is already Now sir you may take him and you madam accompany this gentleman and see where your son is to be  Mrs Dorffen    throwing herself at his feet    Can I leave your highness without humbly  The Prince  What are you doing madam I do not like this  Mrs Dorffen  Permit me to  The Prince    raising her    By no means Rise madam I cannot suffer that in any body  Mrs Dorffen  Well I obey your highness and take my leave    Lifting up her hands    I will bend then before my Maker and pray him to protect for ever so generous a prince  The Prince    with condescension accompanying her a few steps    Farewel madam I wish you happy  THE END OF VOL I
