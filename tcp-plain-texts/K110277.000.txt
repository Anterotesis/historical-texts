respecting his descent birth education or death at least none which we have been able to discover  Mr Moore was bred a linendraper but whether from a stronger attachment to the study than the counter from a more ardent zeal in the pursuit of fame than in the search after fortune or whether from the cause assigned by our Author himself in the Preface to the quarto edition of his works in that  "his marriage with the Muses like most other marriages into that noble family was more from necessity than inclination"  he quitted business to join the retinue of these ladies and he certainly had a very happy and pleasant talent in poetry In his Trial of Selim the Persian which is a compliment to the first and worthy Lord Lyttelton he has shewn himself a perfect master of the most elegant kind of panegyrick that which is couched under the appearance of accusation and his  Fables for the Female Sex not only in the freedom and ease of the verfification but also in the forcibleness of the moral and poignancy of the satire approach nearer to the manner of Mr Gay than any of the numerous imitations of that author which have been attempted since the publication of his Fables  As a dramatick writer Mr Moore has by no means met with the success his pieces have merited which are three in number The Foundling and Gil Blas comedies and The Gamester a tragedy The first has been condemned for its supposed resemblance to the celebrated comedy of The Conscious Lovers and The Gamester met with a cold reception for no other apparent reason but because it too nearly touched a favourite and fashionable vice  The Gamester was also objected to as too prosaick in the language and too horrible in the catastrophe as observed and apologized for by the Author in his Preface to The Gamester quarto edition of  Yet on the whole his plots are interesting his characters well drawn his sentiments delicate and his language poetical and pleasing and what crowns all and more forcibly claims for his Writings publick notice the greatest purity pervades the whole the obvious tendency of every piece being the promotion of morality and virtue as is indeed observed by the Author himself in the Preface already referred to when speaking of his  Writings in general  "Such as the Work now is I submit it to the publick Defects in it there are manyIts merit if it has any and I may be allowed to name it is its being natural and unaffected and  tending to promote virtue  "  Mr Moore married a lady of the name of Hamilton daughter to the Tabledecker to the Princesses she had a poetical turn and has been said to have assisted her husband in the writing of his plays One specimen of her poetry was handed about before their marriage and has since appeared in different collections of songs It was addressed to a daughter of the famous Stephen Duck and begins with the following stanza  Would you think it my Duck for the fault I must own  Your Jenny at last is quite covetous grown  Tho' millions if Fortune should lavishly pour  I still should be wretched if I had not  More  After halfadozen other stanzas in which with great ingenuity and delicacy and yet in a manner that expresses a sincere affection she has quibbled on our Author's name she concludes with the following lines  You will wonder my Girl who this dear one can be  Whose merit can boast such a conquest as me  But you sh' n't know his name tho' I told you before  It begins with an M but I dare not say  More  In the year Mr Moore commenced a weekly  miscellaneous paper entitled The World by Adam FitzAdam in which undertaking he was assisted by Lord Chesterfield and other distinguished characters This paper was collected and published in four volumes and Mr Moore died soon thereafter  PREFACE  MOST of the following Poems have already made their appearance in detached pieces but as many of them were printed without a name I was advised by some particular friends to collect them into a volume and publish them by subscription The painful task of soliciting such a subscription was chiefly undertaken by those friends and with such spirit and zeal that I should be greatly wanting in gratitude if I neglected any opportunity either publick or private of making them my most sincere acknowledgments I am also obliged to a very valuable friend in Ireland for a considerable number of subscribers in that kingdom a list of whose names I have not been favoured with and for which I was desired not to delay publication I mention this seeming neglect that my friends on that side the water may not accuse me of any disrespect  Such as the Work now is I submit it to the publick Defects in it there are many which I have wanted both time and abilities to amend as I could wish Its merit if it has any and I may be allowed to name it is its being natural and unaffected and tending to promote virtue and goodhumour Those parts of it that have been published singly had the good fortune to please those that are now added will I hope be no discredit to them Upon the whole I have sent this my offspring into the world in as decent a dress as I  was able a legitimate one I am sure it is and if it should be thought defective in strength spirit or vigour let it be considered that its father's marriage with the Muses like most other marriages into that noble family was more from necessity than inclination  TO HIS GRACE THOMAS HOLLES DUKE OF NEWCASTLE  MY LORD  HAD I the honour of being personally known to your Grace I had not thus presumptuously addressed you without previous solicitation for so great an indulgence but that your Grace may neither be surprised nor offended at the liberty I am taking my plea is that the great and good man whose name is prefixed to the first of these Poems was a friend and benefactor to me The favours I have received at his hands and the kind assurances he was pleased to give me of their continuance which his death only prevented have left me to lament my own private loss amidst the general concern It is from these favours and assurances that I flatter myself with having a kind of privilege to address your Grace upon this occasion and to entreat your patronage of the following sheets I pretended to no merit with Mr Pelham except that of honouring his virtues and wishing to have been serviceable to them I pretend to no other with your Grace My hopes are that while you are fulfilling every generous intention of the brother whom you loved your Grace will not think me unworthy of some small share of that notice with which he was once pleased to honour me  I will not detain your Grace to echo back the voice of a whole people in favour of your just and prudent administration of publick affairs that the salutary measures you are pursuing may be as productive of tranquillity and honour to your Grace as they are of happiness to these kingdoms is the sincere wish of  MY LORD  Your Grace's most humble most obedient and most devoted servant EDWARD MOORE  Tully's Head PallMall  Feb th  FABLES FOR THE LADIES  FABLE I THE EAGLE AND THE ASSEMBLY OF BIRDS  To her Royal Highness THE PRINCESS OF WALES  THE moral lay to beauty due  I write Fair Excellence to you  Wellpleas'd to hope my vacant hours  Have been employ'd to sweeten your's  Truth under fiction I impart  To weed out folly from the heart  And shew the paths that lead astray  The wand'ring nymph from Wisdom's way  I flatter none the great and good  Are by their actions understood  Your monument if actions raise  Shall I deface by idle praise  I echo not the voice of Fame  That dwells delighted on your name  Her friendly tale however true  Were flatt'ry if I told it you  The proud the envious and the vain  The jilt the prude demand my strain  To these detesting praise I write  And vent in charity my spite  With friendly hand I hold the glass  To all promisc'ous as they pass  Should Folly there her likeness view  I fret not that the mirror 's true  If the fantastick form offend  I made it not but would amend  Virtue in ev'ry clime and age  Spurns at the follysoothing page  While satire that offends the ear  Of Vice and Passion pleases her  Premising this your anger spare  And claim the Fable you who dare  The birds in place by factions press'd  To Jupiter their pray'rs address'd  By specious lies the state was vex'd  Their counsels libellers perplex'd  They begg'd to stop seditious tongues  A gracious hearing of their wrongs  Jove grants their suit The Eagle sat  Decider of the grand debate  The Pie to trust and pow'r preferr'd  Demands permission to be heard  Says he "Prolixity of phrase  "You know I hate This libel says  "Some birds there are who prone to noise  "Are hir'd to silence Wisdom's voice  "And skill'd to chatter out the hour  "Rise by their emptiness to pow'r  "That this is aim'd direct at me  "No doubt you 'll readily agree  "Yet well this sage assembly knows  "By parts to government I rose  "My prudent counsels prop the state  "Magpies were never known to prate"  The Kite rose up his honest heart  In virtue's suff'rings bore a part  "That there were birds of prey he knew  "So far the libeller said true  "Voracious bold to rapine prone  "Who knew no int'rest but their own  "Who hov'ring o'er the farmer's yard  "Nor pigeon chick nor duckling spar'd  "This might be true but if apply'd  "To him in troth the sland'rer ly'd  "Since ign'rance then might be misled  "Such things he thought were best unsaid"  The Crow was vex'd as yestermorn  He flew across the newsown corn  A screaming boy was set for pay  He knew to drive the crows away  Scandal had found out him in turn  And buzz'd abroad that crows love corn  The Owl arose with solemn face  And thus harangu'd upon the case  "That Magpies prate it may be true  "A Kite may be voracious too  "Crows sometimes deal in newsown pease  "He libels not who strikes at these  "The slander 's here"But there are birds  "Whose wisdom lies in looks not words  "Blund'rers who level in the dark  "And always shoot beside the mark  "He names not me but these are hints  "Which manifest at whom he squints  "I were indeed that blund'ring fowl  "To question if he meant an owl"  "Ye Wretches hence" the Eagle cries  "'Tis conscience conscience that applies  "The virtuous mind takes no alarm  "Secur'd by innocence from harm  "While Guilt and his associate Fear  "Are startled at the passing air"  FABLE II THE PANTHER THE HORSE AND OTHER BEASTS  THE man who seeks to win the fair  So custom says must truth forbear  Must fawn and flatter cringe and lie  And raise the goddess to the sky  For truth is hateful to her ear  A rudeness which she cannot bear  A rudeness yes I speak my thoughts  For Truth upbraids her with her faults  How wretched Cloe then am I  Who love you and yet cannot lie  And still to make you less my friend  I strive your errours to amend  But shall the senseless fop impart  The softest passion to your heart  While he who tells you honest truth  And points to happiness your youth  Determines by his care his lot  And lives neglected and forgot  Trust me my Dear with greater ease  Your taste for flatt'ry I could please  And similies in each dull line  Like glowworms in the dark should shine  What if I say your lips disclose  The freshness of the op'ning rose  Or that your cheeks are beds of flow'rs  Enripen'd by refreshing show'rs  Yet certain as these flow'rs shall fade  Time ev'ry beauty will invade  The butterfly of various hue  More than the flow'r resembles you  Fair flutt'ring fickle busy thing  To pleasure ever on the wing  Gayly coquetting for an hour  To die and n'er be thought of more  Would you the bloom of youth should last  'Tis virtue that must bind it fast  An easy carriage wholly free  From sour reserve or levity  Goodnatur'd mirth an open heart  And looks unskill'd in any art  Humility enough to own  The frailties which a friend makes known  And decent pride enough to know  The worth that virtue can bestow  These are the charms which ne'er decay  Tho' youth and beauty fade away  And time which all things else removes  Still heightens virtue and improves  You 'll frown and ask to what intent  This blunt address to you is sent  I 'll spare the question and confess  I 'd praise you if I lov'd you less  But rail be angry or complain  I will be rude while you are vain  Beneath a lion's peaceful reign  When beasts met friendly on the plain  A Panther of majestick port  The vainest female of the court  With spotted skin and eyes of fire  Fill'd ev'ry bosom with desire  Where'er she mov'd a servile crowd  Of fawning creatures cring'd and bow'd  Assemblies ev'ry week she held  Like modern belles with coxcombs fill'd  Where noise and nonsense and grimace  And lies and scandal fill'd the place  Behold the gay fantastick thing  Encircled by the spacious ring  Lowbowing with important look  As first in rank the Monkey spoke  "Gad take me Madam but I swear  "No angel ever look'd so fair  "Forgive my rudeness but I vow  "You were not quite divine till now  "Those limbs that shape and then those eyes  "O close them or the gazer dies"  "Nay gentle Pug for goodness hush  "I vow and swear you make me blush  "I shall be angry at this rate  "'Tis so like flatt'ry which I hate"  The Fox in deeper cunning vers'd  The beauties of her mind rehears'd  And talk'd of knowledge taste and sense  To which the fair have vast pretence  Yet well he knew them always vain  Of what they strive not to attain  And play'd so cunningly his part  That Pug was rivall'd in his art  The Goat avow'd his am'rous flame  And burntfor what he durst not name  Yet hop'd a meeting in the wood  Might make his meaning understood  Half angry at the bold address  She frown'd but yet she must confess  Such beauties might inflame his blood  But still his phrase was somewhat rude  The Hog her neatness much admir'd  The formal Ass her swiftness fir'd  While all to feed her folly strove  And by their praises shar'd her love  The Horse whose gen'rous heart disdain'd  Applause by servile flatt'ry gain'd  With graceful courage silence broke  And thus with indignation spoke  "When flatt'ring Monkies fawn and prate  "They justly raise contempt or hate  "For merit is turn'd to ridicule  "Applauded by the grinning fool  "The artful Fox your wit commends  "To lure you to his selfish ends  "From the vile flatt'rer turn away  "For knaves make friendships to betray  "Dismiss the train of fops and fools  "And learn to live by wisdom's rules  "Such beauties might the Lion warm  "Did not your folly break the charm  "For who would court that lovely shape  "To be the rival of an Ape"  He said and snorting in disdain  Spurn'd at the crowd and sought the plain  FABLE III THE NIGHTINGALE AND GLOWWORM  THE prudent nymph whose cheeks disclose  The lily and the blushing rose  From publick view her charms will screen  And rarely in the crowd be seen  This simple truth shall keep her wise  "The fairest fruits attract the flies"  One night a Glowworm proud and vain  Contemplating her glitt'ring train  Cry'd "Sure there never was in Nature  "So elegant so fine a creature  "All other insects that I see  "The frugal ant industrious bee  "Or silkworm with contempt I view  "With all that low mechanick crew  "Who servilely their lives employ  "In bus'ness enemy to joy  "Mean vulgar Herd ye are my scorn  "For grandeur only I was born  "Or sure am sprung from race divine  "And plac'd on earth to live and shine  "Those lights that sparkle so on high  "Are but the Glowworms of the sky  "And kings on earth their gems admire  "Because they imitate my fire"  She spoke attentive on a spray  A Nightingale forebore his lay  He saw the shining morsel near  And flew directed by the glare  A while he gaz'd with sober look  And thus the trembling prey bespoke  "Deluded Fool with pride elate  "Know it is thy beauty brings thy fate  "Less dazzling long thou might'st have lain  "Unheeded on the velvet plain  "Pride soon or late degraded mourns  "And Beauty wrecks whom she adorns"  FABLE IV HYMEN AND DEATH  SIXTEEN d' ye say Nay then it is time  Another year destroys your prime  But stayThe settlement "That is made"  Why then is my simple girl afraid  Yet hold a moment if you can  And heedfully the fable scan  The shades were fled the morning blush'd  The winds were in their caverns hush'd  When Hymen pensive and sedate  Held o'er the fields his musing gait  Behind him thro' the greenwood shade  Death's meagre form the god survey'd  Who quickly with gigantick stride  Outwent his pace and join'd his side  The chat on various subjects ran  Till angry Hymen thus began  "Relentless Death whose iron sway  "Mortals reluctant must obey  "Still of thy pow'r shall I complain  "And thy too partial hand arraign  "When Cupid brings a pair of hearts  "All over stuck with equal darts  "Thy cruel shafts my hopes deride  "And cut the knot that Hymen ty'd  "Shall not the bloody and the bold  "The miser hoarding up his gold  "The harlot reeking from the stew  "Alone thy fell revenge pursue  "But must the gentle and the kind  "Thy fury undistinguish'd find"  The monarch calmly thus reply'd  "Weigh well the cause and then decide  "That friend of your's you lately nam'd  "Cupid alone is to be blam'd  "Then let the charge be justly laid  "That idle boy neglects his trade  "And hardly once in twenty years  "A couple to your temple bears  "The wretches whom your office blends  "Silenus now or Plutus sends  "Hence care and bitterness and strife  "Are common to the nuptial life  "Believe me more than all mankind  "Your vot'ries my compassion find  "Yet cruel am I call'd and base  "Who seek the wretched to release  "The captive from his bonds to free  "Indissoluble but for me  "'Tis I entice him to the yoke  "By me your crowded altars smoke  "For mortals boldly dare the noose  "Secure that Death will set them loose  FABLE V THE POET AND HIS PATRON  WHY Caelia is your spreading waist  So loose so negligently lac'd  Why must the wrapping bedgown hide  Your snowy bosom's swelling pride  How ill that dress adorns your head  Distain'd and rumpled from the bed  Those clouds that shade your blooming face  A little water might displace  As Nature ev'ry morn bestows  The crystal dew to cleanse the rose  Those tresses as the raven black  That wav'd in ringlets down your back  Uncomb'd and injur'd by neglect  Destroy the face which once they deck'd  Whence this forgetfulness of dress  Pray Madam are you marry'd Yes  Nay then indeed the wonder ceases  No matter now how loose your dress is  The end is won your fortune's made  Your sister now may take the trade  Alas what pity it is to find  This fault in half the female kind  From hence proceed aversion strife  And all that sours the wedded life  Beauty can only point the dart  'Tis neatness guides it to the heart  Let neatness then and beauty strive  To keep a wav'ring flame alive  'Tis harder far you'll find it true  To keep the conquest than subdue  Admit us once behind the screen  What is there farther to be seen  A newer face may raise the flame  But ev'ry woman is the same  Then study chiefly to improve  The charm that fix'd your husband's love  Weigh well his humour Was it dress  That gave your beauty pow'r to bless  Pursue it still be neater seen  'Tis always frugal to be clean  So shall you keep alive desire  And Time's swift wing shall fan the fire  In garret high as stories say  A Poet sung his tuneful lay  So soft so smooth his verse you'd swear  Apollo and the Muses there  Thro' all the Town his praises rung  His sonnets at the playhouse sung  High waving o'er his lab'ring head  The goddess Want her pinions spread  And with poetick fury fir'd  What Phoebus faintly had inspir'd  A noble youth of taste and wit  Approv'd the sprightly things he writ  And sought him in his cobweb dome  Discharg'd his rent and brought him home  Behold him at the stately board  Who but the Poet and my Lord  Each day deliciously he dines  And greedy quaffs the gen'rous wines  His sides were plump his skin was sleek  And plenty wanton'd on his cheek  Astonish'd at the change so new  Away th' inspiring goddess slew  Now dropt for politicks and news  Neglected lay the drooping Muse  Unmindful whence his fortune came  He stifled the poetick flame  Nor tale nor sonnet for my lady  Lampoon nor epigram was ready  With just contempt his Patron saw  Resolv'd his bounty to withdraw  And thus with anger in his look  The laterepenting fool bespoke  "Blind to the good that courts thee grown  "Whence has the sun of favour shone  "Delighted with thy tuneful art  "Esteem was growing in my heart  "But idly thou reject'st the charm  "That gave it birth and kept it warm"  Unthinking fools alone despise  The arts that taught them first to rise  FABLE VI THE WOLF THE SHEEP AND THE LAMB  DUTY demands the parent's voice  Should sanctify the daughter's choice  In that is due obedience shown  To chuse belongs to her alone  May horrour seize his midnight hour  Who builds upon a parent'spow'r  And claims by purchase vile and base  The loathing maid for his embrace  Hence virtue sickens and the breast  Where Peace had built her downy nest  Becomes the troubled seat of care  And pines with anguish and despair  A Wolf rapacious rough and bold  Whose nightly plunders thinn'd the fold  Contemplating his illspent life  And cloy'd with thefts would take a wife  His purpose known the savage race  In num'rous crowds attend the place  For why a mighty Wolf he was  And held dominion in his jaws  Her fav'rite whelp each mother brought  And humbly his alliance sought  But cold by age or else too nice  None found acceptance in his eyes  It happen'd as at early dawn  He solitary cross'd the lawn  Stray'd from the fold a sportive Lamb  Skipp'd wanton by her fleecy dam  When Cupid foe to man and beast  Discharg'd an arrow at his breast  The tim'rous breed the robber knew  And trembling o'er the meadow flew  Their nimblest speed the Wolf o'ertook  And courteous thus the dam bespoke  "Stay Fairest and suspend your fear  "Trust me no enemy is near  "These jaws in slaughter ost' imbru'd  "At length have known enough of blood  "And kinder bus'ness brings me now  "Vanquish'd at Beauty's feet to bow  "You have a daughterSweet forgive  "A Wolf's addressIn her I live  "Love from her eyes like lightning came  "And set my marrow all on flame  "Let your consent confirm my choice  "And ratify our nuptial joys  "Me ample wealth and pow'r attend  "Wide o'er the plains my realms extend  "What midnight robber dare invade  "The fold if I the guard am made  "At home the shepherd's cur may sleep  "While I secure his master's sheep"  Discourse like this attention claim'd  Grandeur the mother's breast inflam'd  Now fearless by his side she walk'd  Of settlements and jointures talk'd  Propos'd and doubled her demands  Of flow'ry fields and turnip lands  The Wolf agrees her bosom swells  To Miss her happy fate she tells  And of the grand alliance vain  Contemns her kindred of the plain  The loathing Lamb with horrour hears  And wearies out her dam with pray'rs  But all in vain mamma best knew  What unexperienc'd girls should do  So to the neighb'ring meadow carry'd  A formal ass the couple marry'd  Torn from the tyrantmother's side  The trembler goes a victimbride  Reluctant meets the rude embrace  And bleats among the howling race  With horrour oft' her eyes behold  Her murder'd kindred of the fold  Each day a sister Lamb is serv'd  And at the glutton's table carv'd  The crashing bones he grinds for food  And slakes his thirst with streaming blood  Love who the cruel mind detests  And lodges but in gentle breasts  Was now no more enjoyment past  The savage hunger'd for the feast  But as we find in human race  A mask conceals the villain's face  Justice must authorize the treat  Till then he long'd but durst not eat  As forth he walk'd in quest of prey  The hunters met him on the way  Fear wings his flight the marsh he sought  The snuffing dogs are set at fault  His stomach balk'd now hunger gnaws  Howling he grinds his empty jaws  Food must be had and Lamb is nigh  His maw invokes the fraudful lie  "Is this" dissembling rage he cry'd  "The gentle virtue of a bride  "That leagu'd with man's destroying race  "She sets her husband for the chase  "By treach'ry prompts the noisy hound  "To scent his footsteps on the ground  "Thou trait'ress vile for this thy blood  "Shall glut my rage and dye the wood"  So saying on the Lamb he flies  Beneath his jaws the victim dies  FABLE VII THE GOOSE AND THE SWANS  I HATE the face however fair  That carries an affected air  The lisping tone the shape constrain'd  The study'd look the passion feign'd  Are fopperies which only tend  To injure what they strive to mend  With what superiour grace enchants  The face which Nature's pencil paints  Where eyes unexercis'd in art  Glow with the meaning of the heart  Where freedom and good humour sit  And easy gaiety and wit  Tho' perfect beauty be not there  The master lines the finish'd air  We catch from ev'ry look delight  And grow enamour'd at the sight  For beauty tho' we all approve  Excites our wonder more than love  While the agreeable strikes sure  And gives the wounds we cannot cure  Why then my Amoret this care  That forms you in effect less fair  If Nature on your cheek bestows  A bloom that emulates the rose  Or from some heav'nly image drew  A form Apelles never knew  Your illjudg'd aid will you impart  And spoil by meretricious art  Or had you Nature's errour come  Abortive from the mother's womb  Your forming care she still rejects  Which only heightens her defects  When such of glitt'ring jewels proud  Still press the foremost in the crowd  At ev'ry publick show are seen  With look awry and awkward mien  The gaudy dress attracts the eye  And magnifies deformity  Nature may underdo her part  But seldom wants the help of art  Trust her she is your surest friend  Nor made your form for you to mend  A Goose affected empty vain  The shrillest of the cackling train  With proud and elevated crest  Precedence claim'd above the rest  Says she "I laugh at human race  "Who say Geese hobble in their pace  "Look here the sland'rous lie detect  "Not haughty man is so erect  "That peacock yonder Lord how vain  "The creature is of his gaudy train  "If both were stript I 'd pawn my word  "A Goose would be the finer bird  "Nature to hide her own defects  "Her bungled work with finery decks  "Were Geese set off with half that show  "Would men admire the peacock No"  Thus vaunting cross the mead she stalks  The cackling breed attend her walks  The sun shot down his noontide beams  The Swans were sporting in the streams  Their snowy plumes and stately pride  Provok'd her spleen "Why there" she cry'd  "Again what arrogance we see  "Those creatures how they mimick me  "Shall ev'ry fowl the waters skim  "Because we Geese are known to swim  "Humility they soon shall learn  "And their own emptiness discern"  So saying with extended wings  Lightly upon the wave she springs  Her bosom swells she spreads her plumes  And the Swan's stately crest assumes  Contempt and mockery ensu'd  And bursts of laughter shook the flood  A Swan superiour to the rest  Sprung forth and thus the fool addrest  "Conceited thing elate with pride  "Thy affectation all deride  "These airs thy awkwardness impart  "And shew thee plainly as thou art  "Among thy equals of the flock  "Thou hadst escap'd the publick mock  "And as thy parts to good conduce  "Been deem'd an honest hobbling Goose"  Learn hence to study wisdom's rules  Know fopp'ry is the pride of fools  And striving Nature to conceal  You only her defects reveal  FABLE VIII THE LAWYER AND JUSTICE  LOVE thou divinest good below  Thy pure delights few mortals know  Our rebel hearts thy sway disown  While tyrant Lust usurps thy throne  The bounteous God of Nature made  The sexes for each other's aid  Their mutual talents to employ  To lessen ills and heighten joy  To weaker woman he assign'd  That soft'ning gentleness of mind  That can by sympathy impart  Its likeness to the roughest heart  Her eyes with magick pow'r endu'd  To fire the dull and awe the rude  His rosy fingers on her face  Shed lavish ev'ry blooming grace  And stamp'd perfection to display  His mildest image on her clay  Man active resolute and bold  He fashion'd in a diff'rent mould  With useful arts his mind inform'd  His breast with nobler passions warm'd  He gave him knowledge taste and sense  And courage for the fair's defence  Her frame resistless to each wrong  Demands protection from the strong  To man she flies when fear alarms  And claims the temple of his arms  By Nature's author thus declar'd  The woman's sov'reign and her guard  Shall man by treach'rous wiles invade  The weakness he was meant to aid  While beauty given to inspire  Protecting love and soft desire  Lights up a wildfire in the heart  And to its own breast points the dart  Becomes the spoiler's base pretence  To triumph over innocence  The wolf that tears the tim'rous sheep  Was never set the fold to keep  Nor was the tiger or the pard  Meant the benighted trav'ller's guard  But man the wildest beast of prey  Wears friendship's semblance to betray  His strength against the weak employs  And where he should protect destroys  Past twelve o'clock the Watchman cry'd  His brief the studious Lawyer ply'd  The allprevailing fee lay nigh  The earnest of tomorrow's lie  Sudden the furious winds arise  The jarring casement shatter'd flies  The doors admit a hollow sound  And rattling from their hinges bound  When Justice in a blaze of light  Reveal'd her radiant form to sight  The wretch with thrilling horrour shook  Loose ev'ry joint and pale his look  Not having seen her in the courts  Or found her mention'd in Reports  He ask'd with falt'ring tongue her name  Her errand there and whence she came  Sternly the whiterob'd Shade reply'd  A crimson glow her visage dy'd  "Canst thou be doubtful who I am  "Is Justice grown so strange a name  "Were not your courts for Justice rais'd  "'Twas there of old my altars blaz'd  "My guardian thee did I elect  "My sacred temple to protect  "That thou and all thy venal tribe  "Should spurn the goddess for the bribe  "Aloud the ruin'd client cries  "Justice has neither ears nor eyes  "In soul alliance with the bar  "'Gainst me the judge denounces war  "And rarely issues his decree

now  I said that Delia 's fair 't is true  But did I say she equall'd you  Cann't I another's face commend  Or to her virtues be a friend  But instantly your forehead lowers  As if her merit lessen'd your's  From female envy never free  All must be blind because you see  Survey the gardens fields and bow'rs  The buds the blossoms and the flow'rs  Then tell me where the woodbine grows  That vies in sweetness with the rose  Or where the lily's snowy white  That throws such beauties on the sight  Yet folly is it to declare  That these are neither sweet nor fair  The crystal shines with fainter rays  Before the diamond's brighter blaze  And fops will say the diamond dies  Before the lustre of your eyes  But I who deal in truth deny  That neither shine when you are by  When zephirs o'er the blossoms stray  And sweets along the air convey  Sha' n't I the fragrant breeze inhale  Because you breathe a sweeter gale  Sweet are the flow'rs that deck the field  Sweet is the smell the blossoms yield  Sweet is the summer gale that blows  And sweet tho' sweeter you the rose  Shall envy then torment your breast  If you are lovelier than the rest  For while I give to each her due  By praising them I flatter you  And praising most I still declare  You fairest where the rest are fair  As at his board a Farmer sat  Replenish'd by his homely treat  His fav'rite Spaniel near him stood  And with his master shar'd the food  The crackling bones his jaws devour'd  His lapping tongue the trenchers scour'd  Till sated now supine he lay  And snor'd the rising fumes away  The hungry Cat in turn drew near  And humbly crav'd a servant's share  Her modest worth the Master knew  And straight the fatt'ning morsel threw  Enrag'd the snarling Cur awoke  And thus with spiteful envy spoke  "They only claim a right to eat  "Who earn by services their meat  "Me zeal and industry inflame  "To scour the fields and spring the game  "Or plunging in the wintry wave  "For man the wounded bird to save  "With watchful diligence I keep  "From prowling wolves his fleecy sheep  "At home his midnight hours secure  "And drive the robber from the door  "For this his breast with kindness glows  "For this his hand the food bestows  "And shall thy indolence impart  "A warmer friendship to his heart  "That thus he robs me of my due  "To pamper such vile things as you"  "I own" with meekness Puss reply'd  "Superiour merit on your side  "Nor does my breast with envy swell  "To find it recompens'd so well  "Yet I in what my nature can  "Contribute to the good of man  "Whose claws destroy the pilf'ring mouse  "Who drives the vermin from the house  "Or watchful for the lab'ring swain  "From lurking rats secures the grain  "From hence if he rewards bestow  "Why should your heart with gall o'erflow  "Why pine my happiness to see  "Since there 's enough for you and me"  "Thy words are just" the Farmer cry'd  "And spurn'd the snarler from his side  FABLE X THE SPIDER AND THE BEE  THE nymph who walks the publick streets  And sets her cap at all she meets  May catch the fool who turns to stare  But men of sense avoid the snare  As on the margin of the flood  With silken line my Lydia stood  I smil'd to see the pains you took  To cover o'er the fraudful hook  Along the forest as we stray'd  You saw the boy his limetwigs spread  Guess'd you the reason of his fear  Lest heedless we approach too near  Far as behind the bush we lay  The linnet flutter'd on the spray  Needs there such caution to delude  The scaly fry and feather'd brood  And think you with inferiour art  To captivate the human heart  The maid who modestly conceals  Her beauties while she hides reveals  Give but a glimpse and fancy draws  Whate'er the Grecian Venus was  From Eve's first figleaf to brocade  All dress was meant for fancy's aid  Which evermore delighted dwells  On what the bashful nymph conceals  When Caelia struts in man's attire  She shews too much to raise desire  But from the hoop's bewitching round  Her very shoe has pow'r to wound  The roving eye the bosom bare  The forward laugh the wanton air  May catch the fop for gudgeons strike  At the bare hook and bait alike  While salmon play regardless by  Till art like nature forms the fly  Beneath a peasant's homely thatch  A Spider long had held her watch  From morn to night with restless care  She spun her web and wove her snare  Within the limits of her reign  Lay many a heedless captive slain  Or flutt'ring struggled in the toils  To burst the chains and shun her wiles  A straying Bee that perch'd hard by  Beheld her with disdainful eye  And thus began "Mean Thing give o'er  "And lay thy slender threads no more  "A thoughtless fly or two at most  "Is all the conquest thou canst boast  "For Bees of sense thy arts evade  "We see so plain the nets are laid  "The gaudy tulip that displays  "Her spreading foliage to the gaze  "That points her charms at all she sees  "And yields to ev'ry wanton breeze  "Attracts not me where blushing grows  "Guarded with thorns the modest rose  "Enamour'd round and round I fly  "Or on her fragrant bosom lie  "Reluctant she my ardour meets  "And bashful renders up her sweets  "To wiser heads attention lend  "And learn this lesson from a friend  "She who with modesty retires  "Adds fuel to her lover's fires  "While such incautious jilts as you  "By folly your own schemes undo"  FABLE XI THE YOUNG LION AND THE APE  'TIS true I blame your lover's choice  Tho' flatter'd by the publick voice  And peevish grow and sick to hear  His exclamations O how fair  I listen not to wild delights  And transports of expected nights  What is to me your hoard of charms  The whiteness of your neck and arms  Needs there no acquisition more  To keep contention from the door  Yes pass a fortnight and you'll find  All beauty cloys but of the mind  Sense and good humour ever prove  The surest cords to fasten love  Yet Phillis simplest of your sex  You never think but to perplex  Coquetting it with ev'ry Ape  That struts abroad in human shape  Not that the coxcomb is your taste  But that it stings your lover's breast  Tomorrow you resign the sway  Prepar'd to honour and obey  The tyrantmistress change for life  To the submission of a wife  Your sollies if you can suspend  And learn instruction from a friend  Reluctant heat the first address  Think often ere you answer Yes  But once resolv'd throw off disguise  And wear your wishes in your eyes  With caution ev'ry look forbear  That might create one jealous fear  A lover's ripening hopes confound  Or give the gen'rous breast a wound  Contemn the girlish arts to tease  Nor use your pow'r unless to please  For fools alone with rigour sway  When soon or late they must obey  The King of brutes in life's decline  Resolv'd dominion to resign  The beasts were summon'd to appear  And bend before the royal heir  They came a day was fix'd the crowd  Before their future monarch bow'd  A dapper Monkey pert and vain  Stepp'd forth and thus address'd the train  "Why cringe my Friends with slavish awe  "Before this pageant king of straw  "Shall we anticipate the hour  "And ere we feel it own his pow'r  "The counsels

 Why so averse so coy to man  Did Nature lavish of her care  From her best pattern form you fair  That you ungrateful to her cause  Should mock her gifts and spurn her laws  And miserlike withhold that store  Which by imparting blesses more  Beauty's a gift by Heav'n assign'd  The portion of the female kind  For this the yielding maid demands  Protection at her lover's hands  And tho' by wasting years it fade  Remembrance tells him once't was paid  And will you then this wealth conceal  For age to rust or time to steal  The summer of your youth to rove  A stranger to the joys of love  Then when life's winter hastens on  And youth's fair heritage is gone  Dow'rless to court some peasant's arms  To guard your wither'd age from harms  No gratitude to warm his breast  For blooming beauty once possest  How will you curse that stubborn pride  Which drove your bark across the tide  And sailing before folly's wind  Left sense and happiness behind  Corinna lest these whims prevail  To such as you I write my Tale  A Colt for blood and mettled speed  The choicest of the running breed  Of youthful strength and beauty vain  Refus'd subjection to the rein  In vain the groom's officious skill  Oppos'd his pride and check'd his will  In vain the master's forming care  Restrain'd with threats or sooth'd with pray'r  Of freedom proud and scorning man  Wild o'er the spacious plains he ran  Where'er luxuriant Nature spread  Her flow'ry carpet o'er the mead  Or bubbling streams softgliding pass  To cool and freshen up the grass  Disdaining bounds he cropp'd the blade  And wanton'd in the spoil he made  In plenty thus the summer past  Revolving winter came at last  The trees no more a shelter yield  The verdure withers from the field  Perpetual snows infest the ground  In icy chains the streams are bound  Cold nipping winds and rattling hail  His lank unshelter'd sides assail  As round he cast his rueful eyes  He saw the thatch'droof cottage rise  The prospect touch'd his heart with cheer  And promis'd kind deliv'rance near  A stable erst his scorn and hate  Was now become his wish'd retreat  His passion cool his pride forgot  A Farmer's welcome yard he sought  The Master saw his woful plight  His limbs that totter'd with his weight  And friendly to the stable led  And saw him litter'd dress'd and fed  In slothful ease all night he lay  The servants rose at break of day  The market calls along the road  His back must bear the pond'rous load  In vain he struggles or complains  Incessant blows reward his pains  Tomorrow varies but his toil  Chain'd to the plough he breaks the soil  While scanty meals at night repay  The painful labours of the day  Subdu'd by toil with anguish rent  His selfupbraidings found a vent  "Wretch that I am" he sighing said  "By arrogance and folly led  "Had but my restive youth been brought  "To learn the lesson Nature taught  "Then had I like my sires of yore  "The prize from ev'ry courser bore  "While man bestow'd rewards and praise  "And females crown'd my latter days  "Now lasting servitude 's my lot  "My birth contemn'd my speed forgot  "Doom'd am I for my pride to bear  "A living death from year to year"  FABLE XIII THE OWL AND THE NIGHTINGALE  TO know the mistress' humour right  See if her maids are clean and tight  If Betty waits without her stays  She copies but her lady's ways  When Miss comes in with boist'rous shout  And drops no curtsy going out  Depend upon 't mamma is one  Who reads or drinks too much alone  If bottled beer her thirst assuage  She feels enthusiastick rage  And burns with ardour to inherit  The gifts and workings of the spirit  If learning crack her giddy brains  No remedy but death remains  Sum up the various ills of life  And all are sweet to such a wife  At home superiour wit she vaunts  And twits her husband with his wants  Her ragged offspring all around  Like pigs are wallowing on the ground  Impatient ever of control  She knows no order but of soul  With books her litter'd floor is spread  Of nameless authors never read  Foul linen petticoats and lace  Fill up the intermediate space  Abroad at visitings her tongue  Is never still and always wrong  All meanings she defines away  And stands with truth and sense at bay  If e'er she meets a gentle heart  Skill'd in the housewife's useful art  Who makes her family her care  And builds Contentment's temple there  She starts at such mistakes in nature  And cries "Lord help us what a creature"  Melissa if the moral strike  You'll find the Fable not unlike  An Owl puss'd up with selfconceit  Lov'd learning better than his meat  Old manuscripts he treasur'd up  And rummag'd ev'ry grocer's shop  At pastrycooks was known to ply  And strip for science ev'ry pie  For modern poetry and wit  He had read all that Blackmore writ  So intimate with Curl was grown  His learned treasures were his own  To all his authors had access  And sometimes would correct the press  In logick he acquir'd such knowledge  You'd swear him Fellow of a college  Alike to ev'ry art and science  His daring genius bid defiance  And swallow'd wisdom with that haste  That cits do custards at a feast  Within the shelter of a wood  One ev'ning as he musing stood  Hard by upon a leafy spray  A Nightingale began his lay  Sudden he starts with anger stung  And screeching interrupts the song  "Pert busy Thing thy airs give o'er  "And let my contemplation soar  "What is the musick of thy voice  "But jarring dissonance and noise  "Be wise true harmony thou 'lt find  "Not in the throat but in the mind  "By empty chirping not attain'd  "But by laborious study gain'd  "Go read the authors Pope explodes  "Fathom the depth of Cibber's Odes  "With modern plays improve thy wit  "Read all the learning Henley writ  "And if thou needs must sing sing then  "And emulate the ways of men  "So shalt thou grow like me refin'd  "And bring improvement to thy kind"  "Thou Wretch" the little Warbler cry'd  "Made up of ignorance and pride  "Ask all the birds and they'll declare  "A greater blockhead wings not air  "Read o'er thyself thy talents scan  "Science was only meant for man  "No useless authors me molest  "I mind the duties of my nest  "With careful wing protect my young  "And cheer their ev'nings with a song  "Thus following Nature and her laws  "From men and birds I claim applause  "While nurs'd in pedantry and sloth  "An Owl is scorn'd alike by both"  FABLE XIV THE SPARROW AND THE DOVE  IT was as learn'd traditions say  Upon an April's blithesome day  When Pleasure ever on the wing  Return'd companion of the Spring  And cheer'd the birds with am'rous heat  Instructing little hearts to beat  A Sparrow frolick gay and young  Of bold address and flippant tongue  Just left his lady of a night  Like him to follow new delight  The youth of many a conquest vain  Flew off to seek the chirping train  The chirping train he quickly found  And with a saucy ease bow'd round  For ev'ry she his bosom burns  And this and that he wooes by turns  And here a sigh and there a bill  And here"Those eyes so form'd to kill"  And now with ready tongue he strings  Unmeaning soft resistless things  With vows and Demme's skill'd to woo  As other pretty fellows do  Not that he thought this short essay  A prologue needful to his play  No trust me says our learned letter  He knew the virtuous sex much better  But these he held as specious arts  To shew his own superiour parts  The form of decency to shield  And give a just pretence to yield  Thus finishing his courtly play  He mark'd the fav'rite of the day  With careless impudence drew near  And whisper'd Hebrew in her ear  A hint which like the Mason's sign  The conscious can alone divine  The flutt'ring nymph expert at feigning  Cry'd "Sirpray Sir explain your meaning  "Go prate to those that may endure ye  "To me this rudenessI'll assure ye"  Then off she glided like a swallow  As sayingYou guess where to follow  To such as know the party set  'Tis needless to declare they met  The Parson's barn as authors mention  Confess'd the fair had apprehension  Her honour there secute from stain  She held all farther trifling vain  No more affected to be coy  But rush'd licentious on the joy  "Hist Love" the male companion cry'd  "Retire a while I fear we 're spy'd"  Nor was the caution vain he saw  A Turtle

to his way  Polluted streams again are pure  And deepest wounds admit a cure  But Woman no redemption knows  The wounds of honour never close  Tho' distant ev'ry hand to guide  Nor skill'd on life's tempestuous tide  If once her feeble bark recede  Or deviate from the course decreed  In vain she seeks the friendless shore  Her swifter folly flies before  The circling ports against her close  And shut the wand'rer from repose  Till by conflicting waves opprest  Her found'ring pinnace sinks to rest  Are there no off'rings to atone  For but a single errour None  Tho' Woman is avow'd of old  No daughter of celestial mould  Her temp'ring not without allay  And form'd but of the finer clay  We challenge from the mortal dame  The strength angelick natures claim  Nay more for sacred stories tell  That ev'n immortal angels fell  Whatever fills the teeming sphere  Of humid earth and ambient air  With varying elements endu'd  Was form'd to fall and rise renew'd  The stars no fix'd duration know  Wide oceans ebb again to flow  The moon repletes her waining face  All beauteous from her late disgrace  And suns that mourn approaching night  Refulgent rise with newborn light  In vain may death and time subdue  While Nature mints her race anew  And holds some vital spark apart  Like virtue hid in ev'ry heart  'Tis hence reviving warmth is seen  To clothe a naked world in green  No longer barr'd by winter's cold  Again the gates of life unfold  Again each insect tries his wing  And lifts fresh pinions on the spring  Again from ev'ry latent root  The bladed stem and tendril shoot  Exhaling incense to the skies  Again to perish and to rise  And must weak Woman then disown  The change to which a world is prone  In one meridian brightness shine  And ne'er like ev'ning suns decline  Resolv'd and firm aloneIs this  What we demand of WomanYes  But should the spark of Vestal fire  In some unguarded hour expire  Or should the nightly thief invade  Hesperia's chaste and sacred shade  Of all the blooming spoil possest  The dragon Honour charm'd to rest  Shall virtue's flame no more return  No more with virgin splendour burn  No more the ravag'd garden blow  With spring's succeeding blossomNo  Pity may mourn but not restore  And Woman falls to rise no more  Within this sublunary sphere  A country liesno matter where  The clime may readily be found  By all who tread poetick ground  A stream call'd Life across it glides  And equally the land divides  And here of Vice the province lies  And there the hills of Virtue rise  Upon a mountain's airy stand  Whose summit look'd to either land  An ancient pair their dwelling chose  As well for prospect as repose  For mutual faith they long were fam'd  And Temp'rance and Religion nam'd  A num'rous progeny divine  Confess'd the honours of their line  But in a little daughter fair  Was centred more than half their care  For Heav'n to gratulate her birth  Gave signs of future joy to earth  White was the robe this infant wore  And Chastity the name she bore  As now the maid in stature grew  A flow'r just op'ning to the view  Oft' thro' her native land she stray'd  And wrestling with the lambkins play'd  Her looks diffusive sweets bequeath'd  The breeze grew purer as she breath'd  The morn her radiant blush assum'd  The spring with earlier fragrance bloom'd  And Nature yearly took delight  Like her to dress the world in white  But when her rising form was seen  To reach the crisis of fifteen  Her parents up the mountain's head  With anxious step their darling led  By turns they snatch'd her to their breast  And thus the fears of age exprest  "O joyful cause of many a care  "O Daughter too divinely fair  "Yon' world on this important day  "Demands thee to a dang'rous way  "A painful journey all must go  "Whose doubtful period none can know  "Whose due direction who can find  "Where reason 's mute and sense is blind  "Ah what unequal leaders these  "Thro' such a wide perplexing maze  "Then mark the warnings of the wise  "And learn what love and years advise  "Far to the right thy prospect bend  "Where yonder tow'ring hills ascend  "Lo there the arduous paths in view  "Which Virtue and her sons pursue  "With toil o'er less'ning earth they rise  "And gain and gain upon the skies  "Narrow is the way her children tread  "No walk for pleasure smoothly spread  "But rough and difficult and steep  "Painful to climb and hard to keep  "Fruits immature those lands dispense  "A food indelicate to sense  "Of taste unpleasant yet from those  "Pure health with cheerful vigour  lows  "And strength unfeeling of decay  "Thro'out the long laborious way  "Hence as they scale that heav'nly road  "Each limb is lighten'd of its load  "From earth refining still they go  "And leave the mortal weight below  "Then spreads the straight the doubtful clears  "And smooth the rugged path appears  "For custom turns fatigue to ease  "And taught by Virtue pain can please  "At length the toilsome journey o'er  "And near the bright celestial shore  "A gulf black fearful and profound  "Appears of either world the bound  "Thro' darkness leading up to light  "Sense backward shrinks and shuns the sight  "For there the transitory train  "Of Time and Form and Care and Pain  "And Matter's gross incumb'ring mass  "Man's late associates cannot pass  "But sinking quit th' immortal charge  "And leave the wond'ring soul at large  "Lightly she wings her obvious way  "And mingles with eternal day  "Thither O thither wing thy speed  "Tho' pleasure charm or pain impede  "To such th' allbounteous Pow'r has giv'n  "For present earth a future heav'n  "For trivial loss unmeasur'd gain  "And endless bliss for transient pain  "Then fear ah fear to turn thy sight  "Where yonder flow'ry fields invite  "Wide on the left the pathway bends  "And with pernicious ease descends  "There sweet to sense and fair to show  "Newplanted Edens seem to blow  "Trees that delicious poison bear  "For death is vegetable there  "Hence is the frame of health unbrac'd  "Each sinew slack'ning at the taste  "The soul to passion yields her throne  "And sees with organs not her own  "While like the slumb'rer in the night  "Pleas'd with the shadowy dream of light  "Before her alienated eyes  "The scenes of Fairyland arise  "The puppet world's amusing show  "Dipp'd in the gaylycolour'd bow  "Sceptres and wreaths and glitt'ring things  "The toys of infants and of kings  "That tempt along the baneful plain  "The idly wise and lightly vain  "Till verging on the gulfy shore  "Sudden they sink and rise no more  But list to what thy Fates declare  "Tho' thou art Woman frail as fair  "If once thy sliding foot should stray  "Once quit yon' heav'nappointed way  "For thee lost Maid for thee alone  "Nor pray'rs shall plead nor tears atone  "Reproach scorn infamy and hate  "On thy returning steps shall wait  "Thy form be loath'd by ev'ry eye  "And ev'ry foot thy presence fly"  Thus arm'd with words of potent sound  Like guardian angels plac'd around  A charm by truth divinely cast  Forward our young advent'rer past  Forth from her sacred eyelids sent  Like Morn forerunning radiance went  While Honour handmaid late assign'd  Upheld her lucid train behind  Awestruck the muchadmiring crowd  Before the virgin vision bow'd  Gaz'd with an evernew delight  And caught fresh virtues at the sight  For not of earth's unequal frame  They deem'd the heav'ncompounded dame  If matter sure the most refin'd  High wrought and temper'd into mind  Some darling daughter of the Day  And body'd by her native ray  Where'er she passes thousands bend  And thousands where she moves attend  Her ways observant eyes confess  Her steps pursuing praises bless  While to the elevated Maid  Oblations as to Heav'n are paid  'Twas on an everblithesome day  The jovial birth of rosy May  When genial warmth no more supprest  Newmelts the frost in ev'ry breast  The cheek with secret flusbing dyes  And looks kind things from chastest eyes  The sun with healthier visage glows  Aside his clouded kerchief throws  And dances up th' ethereal plain  Where late he us'd to climb with pain  While Nature as from bonds set free  Springs out and gives a loose to glee  And now for momentary rest  The Nymph her travell'd step represt  Just turn'd to view the stage attain'd  And glory'd in the height she gain'd  Outstretch'd before her wide survey  The realms of sweet perdition lay  And pity touch'd her soul with wo  To see a world so lost below  When straight the breeze began to breathe  Airs gently wasted from beneath  That bore commission'd witchcraft thence  And reach'd her sympathy of sense  No sounds of discord that disclose  A people sunk and lost in woes  But as of present good possess'd  The very triumph of the bless'd  The Maid in wrapt attention hung  While thus approaching Sirens sung  "Hither Fairest hither haste  "Brightest Beauty come and taste  "What the pow'rs of bliss unfold  "Joys too mighty to be told  "Taste what ecstasies they give  "Dying raptures taste and live  "In thy lap disdaining measure  "Nature empties all her treasure  "Soft desires that sweetly languish  "Fierce delights that rise to anguish  "Fairest dost thou yet delay  "Brightest Beauty come away  "List not when the froward chide  "Sons of Pedantry and Pride  "Snarlers to whose feeble sense  "April sunshine is offence  "Age and Envy will advise  "Ev'n against the joy they prize  "Come in pleasures balmy bowl  "Slake the thirstings of thy soul  "Till thy raptur'd pow'rs are fainting  "With enjoyment past the painting  "Fairest dost thou yet delay  "Brightest Beauty come away"  So sung the Sirens as of yore  Upon the false Ausonian shore  And O for that preventing chain  That bound Ulysses on the main  That so our fair one might withstand  The covert ruin now at hand  The song her charm'd attention drew  When now the tempters stood in view  Curiosity with prying eyes  And hands of busy bold emprise  Like Hermes feather'd were her feet  And like forerunning fancy fleet  By search untaught by toil untir'd  To novelty she still aspir'd  Tasteless of ev'ry good possest  And but in expectation blest  With her associate Pleasure came  Gay Pleasure frolickloving dame  Her mien all swimming in delight  Her beauties half reveal'd to sight  Loose flow'd her garments from the ground  And caught the kissing winds around  As erst Medusa's looks were known  To turn beholders into stone  A dire reversion here they felt  And in the eye of Pleasure melt  Her glance with sweet persuasion charm'd  Unnerv'd the strong the steel'd disarm'd  No safety ev'n the flying find  Who vent'rous look but once behind  Thus was the muchadmiring Maid  While distant more than half betray'd  With smiles and adulation bland  They join'd her side and seiz'd her hand  Their touch envenom'd sweets instill'd  Her frame with new pulsations thrill'd  While half consenting half denying  Reluctant now and now complying  Amidst a war of hopes and fears  Of trembling wishes smiling tears  Still down and down the winning pair  Compell'd the struggling yielding fair  As when some stately vessel bound  To blest Arabia's distant ground  Borne from her courses haply lights  Where Barca's flow'ry clime invites  Conceal'd around whose treach'rous land  Lurk the dire rock and dang'rous sand  The pilot warns with sail and oar  To shun the much suspected shore  In vain the tide too subtly strong  Still bears the wrestling bark along  Till sound'ring she resigns to Fate  And sinks o'erwhelm'd with all her freight  So baffling ev'ry bar to sin  And Heav'n's own pilot plac'd within  Along the devious smooth descent  With pow'rs increasing as they went  The dames accustom'd to subdue  As with a rapid current drew  And o'er the fatal bounds convey'd  The lost the longreluctant maid  Here stop ye Fair Ones and beware  Nor send your fond affections there  Yet yet your darling now deplor'd  May turn to you and Heav'n restor'd  Till then with weeping Honour wait  The servant of her better fate  With Honour left upon the shore  Her friend and handmaid now no more  Nor with the guilty world upbraid  The fortunes of a wretch betray'd  But o'er her failing cast the veil  Rememb'ring you yourselves are frail  And now from allinquiring light  Fast fled the conscious shades of night  The Damsel from a short repose  Confounded at her plight arose  As when with slumb'rous weight opprest  Some wealthy miser sinks to rest  Where felons eye the glitt'ring prey  And steal his hoard of joys away  He borne where golden Indus streams  Of pearl and quarry'd diamond dreams  Like Midas turns the glebe to oar  And stands all wrapt amidst his store  But wakens naked and despoil'd  Of that for which his years had toil'd  So far'd the Nymph her treasure flown  And turn'd like Niobe to stone  Within without obscure and void  She felt all ravag'd all destroy'd  And "O thou curs'd insidious coast  "Are these the blessings thou canst boast  "These Virtue these the joys they find  "Who leave thy heav'ntopt hills behind  "Shade me ye Pines ye Caverns hide  "Ye Mountains cover me" she cry'd  Her trumpet Slander rais'd on high  And told the tidings to the sky  Contempt discharg'd a living dart  A sidelong viper to her heart  Reproach breath'd poisons o'er her face  And soil'd and blasted ev'ry grace  Officious Shame her handmaid new  Still turn'd the mirror to her view  While those in crimes the deepest dy'd  Approach'd to whiten at her side  And ev'ry lewd insulting dame  Upon her folly rose to fame  What should she do attempt once more  To gain the latedeserted shore  So trusting back the mourner flew  As fast the train of fiends pursue  Again the farther shore's attain'd  Again the land of Virtue gain'd  But Echo gathers in the wind  And shows her instant foes behind  Amaz'd with headlong speed she tends  Where late she left a host of friends  Alas those shrinking friends decline  Nor longer own that form divine  With fear they mark the following cry  And from the lonely trembler fly  Or backward drive her on the coast  Where Peace was wreck'd and Honour lost  From earth thus hoping aid in vain  To Heav'n not daring to complain  No truce by hostile Clamour giv'n  And from the face of Friendship driv'n  The Nymph sunk prostrate on the ground  With all her weight of woes around  Enthron'd within a circling sky  Upon a mount o'er mountains high  All radiant sat as in a shrine  Virtue first effluence divine  Far far above the scenes of wo  That shut this cloudwrapt world below  Superiour goddess essence bright  Beauty of uncreated light  Whom should Mortality survey  As doom'd upon a certain day  The breath of Frailty must expire  The world dissolve in living fire  The gems of heav'n and solar flame  Be quench'd by her eternal beam  And Nature quick'ning in her eye  To rise a newborn phenix die  Hence unreveal'd to mortal view  A veil around her form she threw  Which three sad sisters of the shade  Pain Care and Melancholy made  Thro' this her allinquiring eye  Attentive from her station high  Beheld abandon'd to despair  The ruins of her fav'rite Fair  And with a voice whose awful sound  Appall'd the guilty world around  Bid the tumultuous winds be still  To numbers bow'd each list'ning hill  Uncurl'd the surging of the main  And smooth'd the thorny bed of pain  The golden harp of heav'n she strung  And thus the tuneful goddess sung  "Lovely Penitent arise  "Come and claim thy kindred skies  "Come thy sister angels say  "Thou hast wept thy stains away  "Let experience now decide  "'Twixt the good and evil try'd  "In the smooth enchanted ground  "Say unfold the treasures found  "Structures rais'd by morning dreams  "Sands that trip the flitting streams  "Down that anchors on the air  "Clouds that paint their changes there  "Seas that smoothly dimpling lie  "While the storm impends on high  "Showing in an obvious glass  "Joys that in possession pass  "Transient fickle light and gay  "Flatt'ring only to betray  "What alas can life contain  "Life like all its circles vain  "Will the stork intending rest  "On the billow build her nest  "Will the bee demand his store  "From the bleak and bladeless shore  "Man alone intent to stray  "Ever turns from Wisdom's way  "Lays up wealth in foreign land  "Sows the sea and ploughs the sand  "Soon this elemental mass  "Soon th' incumb'ring world shall pass  "Form be wrapt in wasting fire  "Time be spent and life expire  "Then ye boasted Works of men  "Where is your asylum then  "Sons of Pleasure sons of Care  "Tell me Mortals tell me where  "Gone like traces on the deep  "Like a sceptre grasp'd in sleep  "Dews exhal'd from morning glades  "Melting snows and gliding shades  "Pass the world and what 's behind  "Virtue 's gold by fire refin'd  "From an universe deprav'd  "From the wreck of Nature sav'd  "Like the lifesupporting grain  "Fruit of patience and of pain  "On the swain's autumnal day  "Winnow'd from the chaff away  "Little Trembler fear no more  "Thou hast plenteous crops in store  "Seed by genial sorrows sown  "More than all thy scorners own  "What tho' hostile earth despise  "Heav'n beholds with gentler eyes  "Heav'n thy friendless steps shall guide  "Cheer thy hours and guard thy side  "When the fatal trump shall sound  "When th' immortals pour around  "Heav'n shall thy return attest  "Hail'd by myriads of the blest  "Little native of the skies  "Lovely Penitent arise  "Calm thy bosom clear thy brow  "Virtue is thy sister now  "More delightful are my woes  "Than the rapture pleasure knows  "Richer far the weeds I bring  "Than the robes that grace a king  "On my wars of shortest date  "Crowns of endless triumphs wait  "On my cares a period blest  "On my toils eternal rest  "Come with Virtue at thy side  "Come be ev'ry bar desy'd  "Till we gain our native shore  "Sister come and turn no more"  FABLE XVI LOVE AND VANITY  THE breezy morning breath'd perfume  The wak'ning flow'rs unveil'd their bloom  Up with the sun from short repose  Gay Health and lusty Labour rose  The milkmaid caroll'd at her pail  And shepherds whistled o'er the dale  When Love who led a rural life  Remote from bustle state and strife  Forth from his thatch'droof cottage stray'd  And stroll'd along the dewy glade  A nymph who lightly tripp'd it by  To quick attention turn'd his eye  He mark'd the gesture of the fair  Her selfsufficient grace and air  Her steps that mincing meant to please  Her study'd negligence and ease  And curious to inquire what meant  This thing of prettiness and paint  Approaching spoke and bow'd observant  The lady slightly Sir your servant  "Such beauty in so rude a place  "Fair one you do the country grace  "At court no doubt the publick

"Roll up the lucid eye in pray'r  "Soften the voice and in the face  "Look melting harmony and grace  "Thus far extends my friendly pow'r  "Nor quits her in her latest hour  "The couch of decent pain I spread  "In form recline her languid head  "Her thoughts I methodise in death  "And part not with her parting breath  "Then do I set in order bright  "A length of fun'ral pomp to sight  "The glitt'ring tapers and attire  "The plumes that whiten o'er her bier  "And last presenting to her eye  "Angelick fineries on high  "To scenes of painted bliss I waft her  "And form the heav'n she hopes

tempted  "To hold her from her sex exempted"  "For one we 'll never quarrel man  "Take her and keep her if you can  "And pleas'd I yield to your petition  "Since ev'ry fair by such permission  "Will hold herself the one selected  "And so my system stands protected"  "O deaf to virtue deaf to glory  "To truths divinely vouch'd in story"  The godhead in his zeal return'd  And kindling at her malice burn'd  Then sweetly rais'd his voice and told  Of heav'nly nymphs rever'd of old  Hypsipile who sav'd her sire  And Portia's love approv'd by fire  Alike Penelope was quoted  Nor laurel'd Daphne pass'd unnoted  Nor Laodamia's fatal garter  Nor fam'd Lucretia honour's martyr  Alceste's voluntary steel  And Cath'rine smiling on the wheel  But who can hope to plant conviction  Where cavil grows on contradiction  Some she evades or disavows  Demurs to all and none allows  A kind of ancient things call'd fables  And thus the goddess turn'd the tables  Now both in argument grew high  And choler flash'd from either eye  Nor wonder each refus'd to yield  The conquest of so fair a field  When happily arriv'd in view  A goddess whom our grandams knew  Of aspect grave and sober gait  Majestick awful and sedate  As heav'n's autumnal eve serene  When not a cloud o'ercasts the scene  Once Prudence call'd a matron fam'd  And in old Rome Cornelia nam'd  Quick at a venture both agree  To leave their strife to her decree  And now by each the facts were stated  In form and manner as related  The case was short they crav'd opinion  Which held o'er females chief dominion  When thus the goddess answ'ring mild  First shook her gracious head and smil'd  "Alas how willing to comply  "Yet how unfit a judge am I  "In times of golden date it is true  "I shar'd the fickle sex with you  "But from their presence long precluded  "Or held as one whose form intruded  "Full fifty annual suns can tell  "Prudence has bid the sex farewell"  In this dilemma what to do  Or who to think of neither knew  For both still biass'd in opinion  And arrogant of sole dominion  Were forc'd to hold the case compounded  Or leave the quarrel where they found it  When in the nick a rural fair  Of inexperienc'd gait and air  Who ne'er had cross'd the neighb'ring lake  Nor seen the world beyond a wake  With cambrick coif and kerchief clean  Tript lightly by them o'er the green  "Now now" cry'd Love's triumphant child  And at approaching conquest smil'd  "If Vanity will once be guided  "Our diff'rence may be soon decided  "Behold yon' wench a fit occasion  "To try your force of gay persuasion  "Go you while I retire aloof  "Go put those boasted pow'rs to proof  "And if your prevalence of art  "Transcends my yet unerring dart  "I give the fav'rite contest o'er  "And ne'er will boast my empire more"  At once so said and so consented  And well our goddess seem'd contented  Nor pausing made a moment's stand  But tript and took the girl in hand  Meanwhile the godhead unalarm'd  As one to each occasion arm'd  Forth from his quiver cull'd a dart  That erst had wounded many a heart  Then bending drew it to the head  The bowstring twang'd the arrow fled  And to her secret soul addrest  Transfix'd the whiteness of her breast  But here the dame whose guardian care  Had to a moment watch'd the fair  At once her pocket mirror drew  And held the wonder full in view  As quickly rang'd in order bright  A thousand beauties rush to sight  A world of charms till now unknown  A world reveal'd to her alone  Enraptur'd stands the lovesick maid  Suspended o'er the darling shade  Here only fixes to admire  And centres ev'ry fond desire  ODES  THE DISCOVERY AN ODE  TO THE RIGHT HON HENRY PELHAM  "Vir bonus est quis"  HOR  I  TAKE wing my Muse from shore to shore  Fly and that happy place explore  Where Virtue deigns to dwell  If yet she treads on British ground  Where can the fugitive be found  In city court or cell  II  Not there where wine and srantick mirth  Unite the sensual sons of earth  In Pleasure's thoughtless train  Nor yet where sanctity 's a show  Where souls nor joy nor pity know  For human bliss or pain  III  Her social heart alike disowns  The race who shunning crowds and thrones  In shades sequester'd doze  Whose sloth no gen'rous care can wake  Who rot like weeds on Lethe's lake  In senseless vile repose  IV  With these she shuns the factious tribe  Who

were seduc'd by play  When Beauty was her throne  But now where dwelt the Soft Desires  The Furies light forbidden fires  To Love and her unknown  VII  From these th' indignant goddess flies  And where the spires of Science rise  A while suspends her wing  But pedant Pride and Rage are there  And Faction tainting all the air  And pois'ning ev'ry spring  VIII  Long thro' the sky's wide pathless way  The Muse observ'd the wand'rer stray  And mark'd her last retreat  O'er Surry's barren heaths she flew  Descending like the silent dew  On Esher's peaceful seat  IX  There she beholds the gentle Mole  His pensive waters calmly roll  Amidst Elysian ground  There thro' the windings of the grove  She leads her family of Love  And strews her sweets around  X  I hear her bid the daughters fair

PERSIAN FOR DIVERS HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS  THE court was met the pris'ner brought  The council with instructions fraught  And evidence prepar'd at large  On oath to vindicate the charge  But first it is meet where form denies  Poetick helps of fancy'd lies  Gay metaphors and figures fine  And similies to deck the line  'Tis meet as we before have said  To call description to our aid  Begin we then as first it is fitting  With the three Chiefs in judgment sitting  Above the rest and in the chair  Sat Faction with dissembled air  Her tongue was skill'd in specious lies  And murmurs whence dissensions rise  A smiling mask her features veil'd  Her form the patriot's robe conceal'd  With study'd blandishments she bow'd  And drew the captivated crowd  The next in place and on the right  Sat Envy hideous to the sight  Her snaky locks her hollow eyes  And haggard form forbad disguise  Pale discontent and sullen hate  Upon her wrinkled forehead sat  Her lefthand clench'd her cheek sustain'd  Her right with many a murder stain'd  A dagger clutch'd in act to strike  With starts of rage and aim oblique  Last on the left was Clamour seen  Of stature vast and horrid mien  With bloated cheeks and frantick eyes  She sent her yellings to the skies  Prepar'd with trumpet in her hand  To blow sedition o'er the land  With these four more of lesser fame  And humbler rank attendant came  Hypocrisy with smiling grace  And Impudence with brazen face  Contention bold with iron lungs  And Slander with her hundred tongues  The walls in sculptur'd tale were rich  And statues proud in many a nich  Of chiefs who fought in Faction's cause  And perish'd for contempt of laws  The roof in vary'd light and shade  The seat of Anarchy display'd  Triumphant o'er a falling throne  By emblematick figures known  Confusion rag'd and Lust obscene  And Riot with distemper'd mien  And Outrage bold and Mischief dire  And Devastation clad in fire  Prone on the ground a martial maid  Expiring lay and groan'd for aid  Her shield with many a stab was pierc'd  Her laurels torn her spear revers'd  And near her crouch'd amidst the spoils  A lion panted in the toils  With look compos'd the pris'ner stood  And modest pride by turns he view'd  The court the council and the crowd  And with submissive rev'rence bow'd  Proceed we now in humbler strains  And lighter rhymes with what remains  Th' indictment grievously set forth  That Selim lost to patriot worth  In company with one Will Ptt  And many more not taken yet  In Fortyfive the royal palace  Did enter and to shame grown callous  Did then and there his faith forsake  And did accept receive and take  With mischievous intent and base  Value unknown a certain place  He was a second time indicted  For that by evil zeal excited  With learning more than layman's share  Which parsons want and he might spare  In Letter to one Gilbert West  He the said Selim did attest  Maintain support and make assertion  Of certain points from Paul's Conversion  By means whereof the said apostle  Did many an unbeliever jostle  Starting unfashionable fancies  And building truths on known romances  A third charge ran that knowing well  Wits only eat as pamphlets sell  He the said Selim notwithstanding  Did fall to answ'ring shaming branding  Three curious Letters to the Whigs  Making no reader care three figs  For any facts contain'd therein  By which uncharitable sin  An author modest and deserving  Was destin'd to contempt and starving  Against the king his crown and peace  And all the statutes in that case  The pleader rose with brief full charg'd  And on the pris'ner's crimes enlarg'd  But not to damp the Muse's fire  With rhet'rick such as courts require  We'll try to keep the reader warm  And sift the matter from the form  Virtue and social love he said  And honour from the land were fled  That patriots now like other folks  Were made the butt of vulgar jokes  While Opposition dropp'd her crest  And courted pow'r for wealth and rest  Why some folks laugh'd and some folks rail'd  Why some submitted some assail'd  Angry or pleas'dall solv'd the doubt  With who were in and who were out  The sons of Clamour grew so sickly  They look'd for dissolution quickly  Their Weekly Journals finely written  Were sunk in privies all beshn  Old England and the London Evening  Hardly a soul was found believing in  And Caleb once so bold and strong  Was stupid now and always wrong  Ask ye whence rose this soul disgrace  Why Selim has receiv'd a place  And thereby brought the cause to shame  Proving that people void of blame  Might serve their country and their king  By making both the selfsame thing  By which the credulous believ'd  And others by strange arts deceiv'd  That ministers were sometimes right  And meant not to destroy us quite  That bart'ring thus in state affairs  He next must deal in sacred wares  The clergy's rights divine invade  And smuggle in the gospel trade  And all this zeal to reinstate  Exploded notions out of date  Sending old rakes to church in shoals  Like children sniv'ling for their souls  And ladies gay from smut and libels  To learn beliefs and read their Bibles  Erecting conscience for a tutor  To damn the present by the future  As if to evils known and real  'Twas needful to annex ideal  When all of human life we know  Is care and bitterness and wo  With short transitions of delight  To set the shatter'd spirits right  Then why such mighty pains and care  To make us humbler than we are  Forbidding shortliv'd mirth and laughter  By fears of what may come hereafter  Better in ignorance to dwell  None fear but who believe a hell  And if there should be one no doubt  Men of themselves would find it out  But Selim's crimes he said went further  And barely stopp'd on this side murther  One yet remain'd to close the charge  To which with leave he'd speak at large  And first 't was needful to premise  That tho' so long for reasons wise  The press inviolate had stood  Productive of the publick good  Yet still too modest to abuse  It rail'd at vice but told not whose  That great improvements of late days  Were made to many an author's praise  Who not so scrupulously nice  Proclaim'd the person with the vice  Or gave where vices might be wanted  The name and took the rest for granted  Upon this plan a champion  Author of the Letters to the Whigs  rose  Unrighteous greatness to oppose  Proving the man  inventus non est  Who trades in pow'r and still is honest  And God be prais'd he did it roundly  Flogging a certain junto soundly  But chief his anger was directed  Where people least of all suspected  And Selim not so strong as tall  Beneath his grasp appear'd to fall  But Innocence as people say  Stood by and sav'd him in the fray  By her assisted and one Truth  A busy prating forward youth  He rally'd all his strength anew  And at the foe a Letter threw  His weakest part the weapon found  And brought him senseless to the ground  Hence Opposition fled the field  And Ign'rance with her sev'nfold shield  And well they might for things weigh'd fully  The pris'ner with his whore and bully  Must prove for ev'ry foe too hard  Who never fought with such a guard  But Truth and Innocence he said  Would stand him here in little stead  For they had evidence on oath  That would appear too hard for both  Of witnesses a fearful train  Came next th' indictments to sustain  Detraction Hatred and Distrust  And Party of all foes the worst  Malice Revenge and Unbelief  And Disappointment worn with grief  Dishonour foul unaw'd by shame  And ev'ry fiend that vice can name  All these in ample form depos'd  Each fact the triple charge disclos'd  With taunts and gibes of bitter sort  And asking vengeance from the court  The pris'ner said in his defence  That he indeed had small pretence  To soften facts so deeply sworn  But would for his offences mourn  Yet more he hop'd than bare repentance  Might still be urg'd to ward the sentence  That he had held a place some years  He own'd with penitence and tears  But took it not from motives base  Th' indictment there mistook the case  And tho' he had betray'd his trust  In being to his country just  Neglecting Faction and her friends  He did it not for wicked ends  But that complaints and feuds might cease  And jarring parties mix in peace  That what he wrote to Gilbert West  Bore hard against him he confest  Yet there they wrong'd him for the fact is  He reason'd for belief not practice  And people might believe he thought  Tho' practice might be deem'd a fault  He either dream'd it or was told  Religion was rever'd of old  That it gave breeding no offence  And was no foe to wit and sense  But whether this was truth or whim  He would not say the doubt with him  And no great harm he hop'd was how  Th' enlighten'd world would take it now  If they admitted it 'twas well  If not he never talk'd of hell  Nor ev'n hop'd to change men's measnres  Or frighten ladies from their pleasures  One accusation he confest  Had touch'd him more than all the rest  Three Patriot Letters high in same  By him o'erthrown and brought to shame  And tho' it was a rule in vogue  If one man call'd another rogue  The party injur'd might reply  And on his soe retort the lie  Yet what accru'd from all his labour  But foul dishonour to his neighbour  And he 's a most unchristian elf  Who others damns to save himself  Besides as all men knew he said  Those Letters only rail'd for bread  And hunger was a known excuse  For prostitution and abuse  A guinea properly apply'd  Had made the writer change his side  He wish'd he had not cut and carv'd him  And own'd he should have bought not starv'd him  The court he said knew all the rest  And must proceed as they thought best  Only he hop'd such resignation  Would plead some little mitigation  And if his character was clear  From other faults and friends were near  Who would when call'd upon attest it  He did in humblest form request it  To be from punishment exempt  And only suffer their contempt  The pris'ner's friends their claim preferr'd  In turn demanding to be heard  Integrity and Honour swore  Benevolénce and twenty more  That he was always of their party  And that they knew him firm and hearty  Religion sober dame attended  And as she could his cause befriended  She said 't was since he came from college  She knew him introduc'd by Knowledge  The man was modest and sincere  Nor farther could she interfere  The Muses begg'd to interpose  But Envy with loud hissings rose  And call'd them women of ill fame  Liars and prostitutes to shame  And said to all the world 't was known  Selim had had them ev'ry one  The pris'ner blush'd the Muses frown'd  When silence was proclaim'd around  And Faction rising with the rest  In form the pris'ner thus addrest  "You Selim thrice have been indicted  "First that by wicked pride excited  "And bent your country to disgrace  "You have receiv'd and held a place  "Next infidelity to wound  "You 'ave dar'd with arguments profound  "To drive freethinking to a stand  "And with religion vex the land  "And lastly in contempt of right  "With horrid and unnat'ral spite  "You have an author's fame o'erthrown  "Thereby to build and fence your own  "These crimes successive on your trial  "Have met with proofs beyond denial  "To which yourself with shame conceded  "And but in mitigation pleaded  "Yet that the justice of the court  "May suffer not in men's report  "Judgment a moment I suspend  "To reason as from friend to friend  "And first that you of all mankind  "With kings and courts should stain your mind  "You who were Opposition's lord  "Her nerves her sinews and her sword  "That you at last for servile ends  "Should wound the bowels of her friends  "Is aggravation of offence  "That leaves for mercy no pretence  "Yet morefor you to urge your hate  "And back the church to aid the state  "For you to publish such a Letter  "You who have known religion better  "For you I say to introduce  "The fraud againthere 's no excuse  "And last of all to crown your shame  "Was it for you to load with blame  "The writings of a patriot youth  "And summon Innocence and Truth  "To prop your causeWas this for you  "But justice does your crimes pursue  "And sentence now alone remains  "Which thus by me the court ordains  "That you return from whence you came  "There to be stript of all your fame  "By vulgar hands that once a week  "Old England pinch you till you squeak  "That ribald Pamphlets do pursue you  "And Lies and Murmurs to undo you  "With ev'ry foe that Worth procures  "And only Virtue's friends be your's"  THE TRIAL OF SARAH **** ALIAS SLIM SAL FOR PRIVATELY STEALING  THE pris'ner was at large indicted  For that by thirst of gain excited  One day in July last at tea  And in the house of Mrs P  From the left breast of E M Gent  With base felonious intent  Did then and there a heart with strings  Rest quiet peace and other things  Steal rob and plunder and all them  The chattels of the said E M  The prosecutor swore last May  The month he knew but not the day  He left his friends in Town and went  Upon a visit down in Kent  That staying there a month or two  He spent his time as others do  In riding walking fishing swimming  But being much inclin'd to women  And young and wild and no great reas'ner  He got acquainted with the pris'ner  He own'd 't was rumour'd in those parts  That she 'd a trick of stealing hearts  And from fifteen to twentytwo  Had made the devilandall to do  But Mr W the Vicar  And no man brews you better liquor  Spoke of her thefts as tricks of youth  The frolicks of a girl forsooth  Things now were on another score  He said for she was twentyfour  However to make matters short  And not to trespass on the court  The lady was discover'd soon  And thus it was One afternoon  The ninth of July last or near it  As to the day he could not swear it  In company at Mrs P's  Where folks say any thing they please  Dean L and Lady Mary by  And Fanny waiting on Miss Y  He own'd he was inclin'd to think  Both were a little in their drink  The pris'ner ask'd and call'd him Cousin  How many kisses made a dozen  That being as he own'd in liquor  The question made his blood run quicker  And sense and reason in eclipse  He vow'd he 'd score them on her lips  That rising up to keep his word  He got as far as kiss the third  And would have counted th' other nine  And so all present did opine  But that he felt a sudden dizziness  That quite undid him for the business  His speech he said began to falter  His eyes to stare his mouth to water  His breast to thump without cessation  And all within one conflagration  "Bless me" says Fanny "what 's the matter"  And Lady Mary look'd hard at her  And stamp'd and wish'd the pris'ner further  And cry'd out "Part them or there 's murther"  That still he held the pris'ner fast  And would have stood it to the last  But struggling to go thro' the rest  He felt a pain across his breast  A sort of sudden twinge he said  That seem'd almost to strike him dead  And after that such cruel smarting  He thought the soul and body parting  That then he let the pris'ner go  And stagger'd off a step or so  And thinking that his heart was ill  He begg'd of Miss Y 's maid to feel  That Fanny stepp'd before the rest  And laid her hand upon his breast  But mercy on us what a stare  The creature gave no heart was there  Souse went her fingers in the hole  Whence heart and strings and all were stole  That Fanny turn'd and told the pris'ner  She was a thief and so she 'd christen her  And that it was a burning shame  And brought the house an evil name  And if she did not put the heart in  The man would pine and die for certain  The pris'ner then was in her airs  And bid her mind her own affairs  And told his Rev'rence and the rest of 'em  She was as honest as the best of 'em  That lady Mary and dean L  Rose up and said 't was mighty well  But that in gen'ral terms they said it  A heart was gone and some one had it  Words would not do for search they must  And search they would and her the first  That then the pris'ner dropp'd her anger  And said she hop'd they would not hang her  That all she did was meant in jest  And there the heart was and the rest  That then the dean cry'd out O fy  And sent in haste for justice I  Who tho' he knew her friends and pity'd her  Call'd her hard names and so committed her  The parties present swore the same  And Fanny said the pris'ner's name  Had frighten'd all the country round  And glad she was the bill was found  She knew a man who knew another  Who knew the very party's brother  Who lost his heart by mere surprise  One morning looking at her eyes  And others had been known to squeak  Who only chanc'd to hear her speak  For she had words of such a sort  That tho' she knew no reason for 't  Would make a man of sense run mad  And rifle him of all he had  And that she 'd rob the whole community  If ever she had opportunity  The pris'ner now first silence broke  And curtsy'd round her as she spoke  She own'd she said it much incens'd her  To hear such matters sworn against her  But that she hop'd to keep her temper  And prove herself  eadem semper  That what the prosecutor swore  Was some part true and some part more  She own'd she had been often seen with him  And laugh'd and chatted on the green with him  The fellow seem'd to have humanity  And told her tales that sooth'd her vanity  Pretending that he lov'd her vastly  And that all women else look'd ghastly  But then she hop'd the court would think  She never was inclin'd to drink  Or suffer hands like his to daub her  Or encourage men to kiss and slobber her  She 'd have folks know she did not love it  Or if she did she was above it  But this she said was sworn of course  To prove her giddy and then worse  As she whose conduct was thought  levis  Might very well be reckon'd thievish  She hop'd she said the court's discerning  Would pay some honour to her learning  For ev'ry day from four to past six  She went up stairs and read the classicks  Thus having clear'd herself of levity  The rest she said would come with brevity  And first it injur'd not her honour  To own the heart was found upon her  For she could prove and did aver  The paltry thing belong'd to her  The fact was thus This prince of knaves  Was once the humblest of her slaves  And often had confess'd the dart  Her eyes had lodg'd within his heart  That she as 't was her constant fashion  Made great diversion of his passion  Which set his blood in such a ferment  As seem'd to threaten his interment  That then she was afraid of losing him  And so desisted from abusing him  And often came and felt his pulse  And bid him write to Doctor Hulse  The prosecutor thank'd her kindly  And sigh'd and said she look'd divinely  But told her that his heart was bursting  And doctors he had little trust in  He therefore begg'd her to accept it  And hop'd 't would mend if once she kept it  That having no aversion to it  She said with all her soul she 'd do it  But then she begg'd him to remember  If he should need it in December  For winter months would make folks shiver  Who wanted either heart or liver  It never could return and added  'Twas her's for life if once she had it  The prosecutor said Amen  And that he wish'd it not again  And took it from his breast and gave her  And how'd and thank'd her for the favour  But begg'd the thing might not be spoke of  As heartless men were made a joke of  That next day whisp'ring him about it  And asking how he felt without it  He sigh'd and cry'd "Alack alack"  And begg'd and pray'd to have it back  Or that she 'd give him her's instead on 't  But she conceiv'd there was no need on 't  And said and bid him make no pother  He should have neither one nor th' other  That then he rav'd and storm'd like Fury  And said that one was his  de jure  And rather than he 'd leave pursuing her  He 'd swear a robbery and ruin her  That this was truth she did aver  Whatever hap betided her  Only that Mrs P she said  Miss Y and her deluded maid  And Lady Mary and his Reverence  Were folks to whom she paid some deference  And that she verily believ'd  They were not perjur'd but deceiv'd  Then Doctor D begg'd leave to speak  And sigh'd as if his heart would break  He said that he was Madam's surgeon  Or rather as in Greek chirurgeon  From  chier manus ergon opus  As scope is from the Latin  scopus  That he he said had known the prisoner  From the first sun that ever rise on her  And griev'd he was to see her there  But took upon himself to swear  There was not to be found in nature  A sweeter or a better creature  And if the king God bless him knew her  He 'd leave St James's to get to her  But then as to the fact in question  He knew no more on 't than Hephaestion  It might he false and might be true  And this he said was all he knew  The judge proceeded to the charge  And gave the evidence at large  But often cast a sheep's eye at her  And strove to mitigate the matter  Pretending facts were not so clear  And mercy ought to interfere  The jury then withdrew a moment  As if on weighty points to comment  And right or wrong resolv'd to save her  They gave a verdict in her favour  But why or wherefore things were so  It matters not for us to know  The culprit by escape grown bold  Pilfers alike from young and old  The country all around her teases  And robs or murders whom she pleases  ENVY AND FORTUNE A TALE  TO MRS GARRICK  SAYS Envy to Fortune "Soft soft Madam Flirt  "Not so fast with your wheel you 'll be down in the dirt  "Well and how does your David Indeed my dear creature  "You 'ave shewn him a wonderful deal of good nature  "His bags are so full and such praises his due  "That the like was ne'er knownand allowing to you  "But why won't you make him quite happy for life  "And to all you have done add the gift of a wife"  Says Fortune and smil'd "Madam Envy God save ye  "But why always sneering at me and poor Davy  "I own that sometimes in contempt of all rules  "I lavish my favours on blockheads and sools  "But the case is quite different here I aver it  "For David ne'er knew me till brought me by Merit  "And yet to convince youNay Madam no hisses  "Good manners at leastSuch behaviour as this is"  For mention but Merit and Envy flies out  With a hiss and a yell that would silence a rout  But Fortune went on"To convince you I say  "That I honour your scheme I 'll about it today  "The man shall be marry'd so pray now be easy  "And Garrick for once shall do something to please ye"  So saying she rattled her wheel out of sight  While Envy walk'd after and grinn'd with delight  It seems it was a trick that she long had been brewing  To marry poor David and so be his ruin  For Slander had told her the creature lov'd pelf  And car'd not a fig for a soul but himself  From thence she was sure had the devil a daughter  He'd snap at the girl so it was Fortune that brought her  And then should her temper be sullen or haughty  Her flesh too be frail and incline to be naughty  'Twould fret the poor fellow so out of his reason  That Barry and Quin would set fashions next season  But Fortune who saw what the Fury design'd  Resolv'd to get David a wife to his mind  Yet afraid of herself in a matter so nice  She visited Prudence and begg'd her advice  The nymph shook her head when the bus'ness she knew  And said that her female acquaintance were few  That excepting Miss R***O yes there was one  A friend of that lady's she visited none  But the first was too great and the last was too good  And as for the rest she might get whom she cou'd  Away hurry'd Fortune perplex'd and half mad  But her promise was pass'd and a wife must be had  She travers'd the Town from one corner to th' other  Now knocking at one door and then at another  The girls curtsy'd low as she look'd in their faces  And bridled and primm'd with abundance of graces  But this was conquettish and that was a prude  One stupid and dull th' other noisy and rude  A third was affected quite careless a fourth  With prate without meaning and pride without worth  A fifth and a sixth and a seventh were such  As either knew nothing or something too much  In short as they pass'd she to all had objections  The gay wanted thought the goodhumour'd affections  The prudent were ugly the sensible dirty  And all of them flirts from fifteen up to thirty  When Fortune saw this she began to look silly  Yet still she went on till she reach'd Piccadilly  But vex'd and fatigu'd and the night growing late  She rested her wheel within Burlington gate  My lady rose up as she saw her come in  "O ho Madam Genius pray where have you been"  For her ladyship thought from so serious an air  'Twas Genius come home for it seems she liv'd there  But Fortune not minding her ladyship's blunder  And wiping her forehead cry'd "Well may you wonder  "To see me thus flurry'd"then told her the case lady  And sigh'd till her ladyship laugh'd in her face  "Mighty civil indeed""Come a truce" says my  "A truce with complaints and perhaps I may aid ye  "I'll shew you a girl thatHere Martin go tell  "But she is gone to undress by and by is as well  "I 'll shew you a sight that you 'll fancy uncommon  "Wit beauty and goodness all met in a woman  "A heart to no folly or mischief inclin'd  "A body all grace and all sweetness a mind"  "O pray let me see her" says Fortune and smil'd  "Do but give her to me and I 'll make her my child  "But who my Dear whofor you have not told yet"  "Who indeed" says my lady "if not Violette"  The words were scarce spoke when she enter'd the room  A blush at the stranger still heighten'd her bloom  So humble her looks were so mild was her air  That Fortune astonish'd sat mute in her chair  My lady rose up and with countenance bland  "This is Fortune my Dear" and presented her hand  The goddess embrac'd her and call'd her her own  And compliments over her errand made known  But how the sweet girl colour'd flutter'd and trembled  How oft' she said No and how ill she dissembled  Or how little David rejoic'd at the news  And swore from all others it was her he would chuse  What methods he try'd and what arts to prevail  All these were they told would but burden my tale  In short all affairs were so happily carry'd  That hardly six weeks pass'd away till they marry'd  But Envy grew sick when the story she heard  Violette was the girl that of all she most fear'd  She knew her good humour her beauty and sweetness  Her ease and compliance her taste and her neatness  From these she was sure that her man could not roam  And must rise on the stage from contentment at home  So on she went hissing and inwardly curs'd her  And Garrick next season will certainly burst her  TO THE RIGHT HON HENRY PELHAM The Humble Petition of the Worshipful Company of POETS AND NEWSWRITERS  SHEWETH  THAT your Honour's petitioners dealers in rhymes  And writers of scandal for mending the times  By losses in bus'ness and England's well doing  Are sunk in their credit and verging on ruin  That these their misfortunes they humbly conceive  Arise not from dulness as some folks believe  But from rubs in their way which your Honour has laid  And want of materials to carry on trade  That they always had form'd high conceits of their use  And meant their last breath should go out in abuse  But now and they speak it with sorrow and tears  Since your Honour has sat at the helm of affairs  No party will join them no faction invite  To heed what they say or to read what they write  Sedition and Tumult and Discord are fled  And Slander scarce ventures to lift up her head  In short publick bus'ness is so carry'd on  That their country is sav'd and the patriots undone  To perplex them still more and sure famine to bring  Now satire has lost both its truth and its sting  If in spite of their natures they bungle at praise  Your Honour regards not and nobody pays  Your petitioners therefore most humbly entreat  As the times will allow and your Honour thinks meet  That measures be chang'd and some cause of complaint  Be immediately furnish'd to end their restraint  Their credit thereby and their trade to retrieve  That again they may rail and the nation believe  Or else if your wisdom shall deem it all one  Now the Parliament 's rising and bus'ness is done  That your Honour would please at this dangerous crisis  To take to your bosom a few private vices  By which your petitioners haply might thrive  And keep both themselves and contention alive  In compassion good Sir give them something to say  And your Honour's petitioners ever shall pray  THE LOVER AND THE FRIEND  O Thou for whom my lyre I string  Of whom I speak and think and sing  Thou constant object of my joys  Whose sweetness ev'ry wish employs  Thou dearest of thy sex attend  And hear the Lover and the Friend  Fear not the poet's flatt'ring strain  No idle praise my verse shall stain  The lowly numbers shall impart  The faithful dictates of my heart  Nor humble modesty offend  And part the Lover from the Friend  Not distant is the cruel day  That tears me from my hopes away  Then frown not Fairest if I try  To steal the moisture from your eye  Or force your heart a sigh to send  To mourn the Lover and the Friend  No perfect joy my life e'er knew  But what arose from love and you  Nor can I fear another pain  Than your unkindness or disdain  Then let your looks their pity lend  To cheer the Lover and the Friend  Whole years I strove against the flame  And suffer'd ills that want a name  Yet still the painful secret kept  And to myself in silence wept  Till now unable to contend  I own'd the Lover and the Friend  I saw you still your gen'rous heart  In all my sorrows bore a part  Yet while your eyes with pity glow'd  No words of hope your tongue bestow'd  But mildly bid me cease to blend  The name of Lover with the Friend  Sick with desire and mad with pain  I seek for happiness in vain  Thou lovely Maid to thee I cry  Heal me with kindness or I die  From sad despair my soul defend  And fix the Lover and the Friend  Curs'd be all wealth that can destroy  My utmost hope of earthly joy  Thy gifts O Fortune I resign  Let her and Poverty be mine  And ev'ry year that life shall lend  Shall bless the Lover and the Friend  In vain alas in vain I strive  To keep a dying hope alive  The last sad remedy remains  'Tis absence that must heal my pains  Thy image from my bosom rend  And force the Lover from the Friend  Vain thought tho' seas between us roll  Thy love is rooted in my soul  The vital blood that warms my heart  With thy idea must depart  And Death's decisive stroke must end  At once the Lover and the Friend  THE NUN A CANTATA  RECITATIVE  OF Constance holy legends tell  The softest sister of the cell  None sent to heav'n so sweet a cry  Or roll'd at mass so bright an

fancy delights as I did  "With maidens at midnight to sigh  "And love the sweet passion forbid  "O Father my follies forgive  "And still to absolve me be nigh  "Your lessons have taught me to live

rapture I yield up my breath"  "Ah Daughter he fondly reply'd  "The righteous find comfort in death"  SOLOMON A SERENATA IN THREE PARTS  SET TO MUSICK BY DR BOYCE  PART I  CHORUS  "BEHOLD Jerusalem

grandeur musing sad I stray  Around a melancholy silence reigns  That prompts me to indulge the plaintive lay  Here liv'd Eugenio born of noble race  Aloft his mansion rose around were seen  Extensive gardens deck'd with ev'ry grace  Ponds walks and groves thro' all the seasons green  Ah where is now its boasted beauty fled  Proud turrets that once glitter'd in the sky  And broken columns in confusion spread  A rude misshapen heap of ruins lie  Of splendid rooms no traces here are found  How are these tott'ring walls by time defac'd  Shagg'd with vile thorn with twining ivy bound  Once hung with tapestry with paintings grac'd  In ancient times perhaps where now I tread  Licentious Riot crown'd the midnight bowl  Her dainties Luxury pour'd and Beauty spread  Her artful snares to captivate the soul  Or here attended by a chosen train  Of innocent delight true Grandeur dwelt  Diffusing blessings o'er the distant plain  Health joy and happiness by thousands felt  Around now Solitude unjoyous reigns  No gay gilt chariot hither marks the way  No more with cheerful hopes the needy swains  At the once bounteous gate their visits pay  Where too is now the garden's beauty fled  Which ev'ry clime was ransack'd to supply  O'er the drear spot see desolation spread  And the dismantled walls in ruins lie  Dead are the trees that once with nicest care  Arrang'd from op'ning blossoms shed perfume  And thick with fruitage stood the pendent pear  The ruddy colour'd peach and glossy plum  Extinct is all the family of flow'rs  In vain I seek the arbour's cool retreat  Where ancient friends in converse pass'd the hours  Defended from the raging Dogstar's heat  Along the terrace walks are straggling seen  The prickly bramble and the noisome weed  Beneath whose covert crawls the toad obscene  And snakes and adders unmolested breed  The groves where Pleasure walk'd her rounds decay  The mead untill'd a barren aspect wears  And where the sprightly fawn was wont to play  O'ergrown with heath a dreary waste appears  In yonder wideextended vale below  Where osiers spread a pond capacious stood  From far by art the stream was taught to flow  Whose liquid stores supply'd th' unfailing flood  Oft' here the silent angler took his place  Intent to captivate the scaly fry  But perish'd now are all the num'rous race  Dumb is the fountain and the channel dry  Here then ye Great behold th' uncertain state  Of earthly grandeurBeauty strength and pow'r  Alike are subject to the stroke of Fate  And flourish but the glory of an hour  Virtue alone no dissolution fears  Still permanent tho' ages roll away  Who builds on her immortal basis rears  A superstructure time can ne'er decay  SONGS  SONG I  I  THUS I said to my heart in a pet th' other day  "I had rather be hang'd than go moping this way  "No throbbings no wishes your moments employ  "But you sleep in my breast without motion or joy  II  "When Cloe perplex'd me 't was sweeter by half  "And at Thais's wiles I could oftentimes laugh  "Your burnings and akings I strove not to cure  "Tho' one was a jilt and the other a whore  III  "When I walk'd up the Mall or stroll'd thro'the street  "Not a petticoat brush'd me but then you could beat  "Or if bang went the hoop against corner or post  "In the magical round you were sure to be lost  IV  "But now if a nymph goes as naked as Eve  "Like Adam unfallen you never perceive  "Or the seat of delight if the tippet should hide  "You tempt not my fingers to draw it aside  V  "Is it caution or dread or the frost of old age  "That inclines you with beauty no more to engage  "Tell me quickly the cause for it makes me quite mad  "In the summer's gay season to see you so sad"  VI  "Have a care" quoth my Heart "how you tempt me to stray  "He that hunts down a woman must run a dd way  "Like a hare she can wind or hold out with the fox  "And secure in the chase her pursuers she mocks  VII  "For Cloe I burnt with an innocent flame  "And beat to the musick that breath'd out her name  "Three summers flew over the castles I built  "And beheld me a fool and my goddess a jilt  VIII  "Next Thais the wanton my wishes employ'd  "And the kind one repair'd what the cruel destroy'd  "Like Shadrach I liv'd in a furnace of fire  "But unlike him was scorch'd and compell'd to retire  IX  "Recruited once more I forgot all my pain  "And was jilted and burnt and bedevil'd again  "Not a petticoat fring'd or the heel of a shoe  "Ever pass'd you by daylight but at it I flew  X  "Thus jilted and wounded and burnt to a coal  "For rest I retreated again to be whole  "But your eyes ever open to lead me astray  "Have beheld a new face and command me away  XI  "But remember in whatever flames I may burn  "'Twill be solly to ask for or wish my return  "Neither Thais nor Cloe again shall inflame  "But a nymph more provoking than all you can name"  XII  This said with a bound from my bosom he flew  O Phillis these eyes saw him posting to you  Enslav'd by your wit he grows fond of his chain  And vows I shall never possess him again  SONG II  COLIN  BE still O ye Winds and attentive ye Swains  'Tis Phebe invites and replies to my strains

pleasures it brightens drives sorrow away  Gives joy to the night and enlivens the day  COL  With Phebe beside me the seasons how gay  Then winter's bleak months seem as pleasant as May  The summer's gay verdure springs still as she treads  And linnets and nightingales sing thro' the meads  PHEB  When Colin is absent 't is winter all round  How faint is the sunshine how barren the ground  Instead of the linnet and nightingale's song  I hear the hoarse raven croak all the day long  BOTH  'Tis love like the sun  c  COL  O'er hill dale and valley my Phebe and I  Together will wander and Love shall be by  Her Colin shall guard her safe all the long day  And Phebe at night all his pains shall repay  PHEB  By moonlight when shadows glide over the plain  His kisses shall cheer me his arm shall sustain  The dark haunted grove I can trace without fear  Or sleep in a churchyard if Colin is near  BOTH  'Tis love like the sun  c  COL  Ye Shepherds that wanton it over the plain  How fleeting your transports how lasting your pain  Inconstancy shun and reward the kind she  And learn to be happy of Phebe and me  PHEB  Ye Nymphs who the pleasures of love never try'd  Attend to my strains and take me for your guide  Your hearts keep from pride and inconstancy free  And learn to be happy of Colin and me  BOTH  'Tis love like the sun that gives light to the year  The sweetest of blessings that life can endear  Our pleasures it brightens drives sorrow away  Gives joy to the night and enlivens the day  SONG III  I  AS Phillis the gay at the break of the day  Went forth to the meadows a Maying  A clown lay asleep by a river so deep  That round in meanders was straying  II  His bosom was bare and for whiteness so rare  Her heart it was gone without warning  With cheeks of such hue that the rose wet with dew  Ne'er look'd half so fresh in a morning  III  She cull'd the new hay and down by him she lay  Her wishes too warm for disguising  She play'd with his eyes till he wak'd in surprise  And blush'd like the sun at his rising  IV  She sung him a song as he lean'd on his prong  And rested her arm on his shoulder  She press'd his coy cheek to her bosom so sleek  And taught his two arms to infold her  V  The rustick grown kind by a kiss told his mind  And call'd her his Dear and his Blessing  Together they stray'd and sung frolick'd and play'd  And what they did more there 's no guessing  SONG IV  HE  LET rakes for pleasure range the Town  Or misers dote on golden guineas  Let Plenty smile or Fortune frown  The sweets of love are mine and Jenny's  SHE  Let wanton maids indulge desire  How soon the fleeting pleasure gone is  The joys of virtue never tire  And such shall still be mine and Johnny's  BOTH  Together let us sport and play  And live in pleasure where no sin is  The priest shall tie the knot today  And wedlock's bands make Johnny Jenny's  HE  Let roving swains young hearts invade  The pleasure ends in shame and solly  So Willy woo'd and then betray'd  The poor believing simple Molly  SHE  So Lucy lov'd and lightly toy'd  And laugh'd at harmless maids who marry  But now she finds her shepherd cloy'd  And chides too late her faithless Harry  BOTH  But we 'll together  c  HE  By cooling streams our flocks we 'll feed  And leave deceit to knaves and ninnies  Or fondly stray where Love shall lead  And ev'ry joy be mine and Jenny's  SHE  Let guilt the faithless bosom fright  The constant heart is always bonny  Content and Peace and sweet Delight  And Love shall live with me and Johnny  BOTH  Together still we 'll sport and play  And live in pleasure where no sin is  The priest shall tie the knot today  And wedlock's bands make Johnny Jenny's  SONG V  I  STAND round my brave Boys with heart and with voice  And all in full chorus agree  We 'll fight for our king and as loyally sing  And let the world know we 'll be free  CHORUS  The rebels shall fly as with shouts we draw nigh  And Echo shall victory ring  Then safe from alarms we 'll rest on our arms  And chorus it Long live the King  II  Then commerce once more shall bring wealth to our shore  And plenty and peace bless the isle  The peasant shall quaff off his bowl with a laugh  And reap the sweet fruits of his toil  CHORUS  The rebels  c  III  Kind love shall repay the fatigues of the day  And melt us to softer alarms  Coy Phillis shall burn at her soldier's return  And bless the brave youth in her arms  CHORUS  The rebels shall fly as with shouts we draw nigh  And Echo shall victory ring  Then safe from alarms we 'll rest on our arms  And chorus it Long live the King  SONG VI  I  TO make the wife kind and to keep the house still  You must be of her mind let her say what she will  In all that she does you must give her her way  For tell her she 's wrong and you lead her astray  CHORUS  Then Husbands take care of suspicion beware  Your wives may be true if you fancy they are  With confidence trust them and be not such elves  As to make by your jealousy horns for yourselves  II  Abroad all the day if she chuses to roam  Seem pleas'd with her absence she 'll sigh to come home  The man she likes best and longs most to get at  Be sure to commend and she 'll hate him for that  CHORUS  Then Husbands  c  III  What virtues she has you may safely oppose  Whatever her follies are praise her for those  Applaud all her schemes that she lays for a man  For accuse her of vice and she 'll sin if she can  CHORUS  Then Husbands take care of suspicion beware  Your wives may be true if you fancy they are  With confidence trust them and be not such elves  As to make by your jealousy horns for yourselves  SONG VII  DAMON  HARK hark o'er the plains how the merry bells ring  Asleep while my charmer is laid  The village is up and the day on the wing  And Phillis may yet die a maid  PHIL  'Tis hardly yet day and I cannot away  O Damon I am young and afraid  Tomorrow my Dear I 'll to church without fear  But let me tonight lie a maid  DAM  The bridemaids are met and mamma 's on the fret  All all my coy Phillis upbraid  Come open the door and deny me no more  Nor cry to live longer a maid  PHIL  Dear Shepherd forbear and tomorrow I swear  Tomorrow I 'll not be afraid  I 'll open the door and deny you no more  Nor cry to live longer a maid  DAM  No no Phillis no on that bosom of snow  Tonight shall your shepherd be laid  By morning my dear shall be eas'd of her fear  Nor grieve she 's no longer a maid  PHIL  Then open the door 't was unbolted before  His bliss silly Damon delay'd  To church let us go and if there I say No  O then let me die an old maid  SONG VIII  I  THAT Jenny's my friend my delight and my pride  I always have boasted and seek not to hide  I dwell on her praises wherever I go  They say I 'm in love but I answer No no  II  At ev'ning oft'times with what pleasure I see  A note from her hand "I 'll be with you at tea"  My heart how it bounds when I hear her below  But say not 't is love for I answer No no  III  She sings me a song and I echo each strain  Again I cry Jenny sweet Jenny again  I kiss her soft lips as if there I could grow  And fear I 'm in love tho' I answer No no  IV  She tells me her faults as she sits on my knee  I chide her and swear she 's an angel to me  My shoulder she taps and still bids me think so  Who knows but she loves tho' she tells me No no  V  Yet such is my temper so dull am I grown  I ask not her heart but would conquer my own  Her bosom's soft peace shall I seek to o'erthrow  And wish to persuade while I answer No no  VI  From beauty and wit and good humour ah why  Should Prudence advise and compel me to fly  Thy bounties O Fortune make haste to bestow  And let me deserve her or still I say No  SONG IX  I  YOU tell me I 'm handsome I know not how true  And easy and chatty and good humour'd too  That my lips are as red as the rosebud in June  And my voice like the nightingale's sweetly in tune  All this has been told me by twenty before  But he that would win me must flatter me more  II  If beauty from virtue receive no supply  Or prattle from prudence how wanting am I  My ease and good humour short raptures will bring  And my voice like the nightingale's know but a spring  For charms such as these then your praises give o'er  To love me for life you must love me for more  III  Then talk to me not of a shape or an air  For Cloe the wanton can rival me there  'Tis virtue alone that makes beauty look gay  And brightens good humour as sunshine the day  For that if you love me your flame shall be true  And I in my turn may be taught to love too  SONG X  I  HOW blest has my time been whatdays have I known  Since wedlock's soft bondage made Jesse my own  So joyful my heart is so easy my chain  That freedom is tasteless and roving a pain  II  Thro' walks grown with woodbines as often we stray  Around us our boys and girls frolick and play  How pleasing their sport is the wanton ones see  And borrow their looks from my Jesse and me  III  To try her sweet temper sometimes am I seen  In revels all day with the nymphs on the green  Tho' painful my absence my doubts she beguiles  And meets me at night with compliance and smiles  IV  What tho' on her cheek the rose loses its hue  Her ease and good humour bloom all the year thro'  Time still as he flies brings increase to her truth  And gives to her mind what he steals from her youth  V  Ye Shepherds so gay who make love to ensnare  And cheat with false vows the too credulous fair  In search of true pleasure how vainly you roam  To hold it for life you must find it at home  SONG XI  I  HARK hark 't is a voice from the tomb  "Come Lucy" it cries "come away  "The grave of thy Colin has room  "To rest thee beside his cold clay"  "I come my dear Shepherd I come  "Ye Friends and Companions adieu  "I haste to my Colin's dark home  "To die on his bosom so true"  II  All mournful the midnight bell rung  When Lucy sad Lucy arose  And forth to the green turf she sprung  Where Colin's pale ashes repose  All wet with the night's chilling dew  Her bosom embrac'd the cold ground  While stormy winds over her blew  And night ravens croak'd all around  III  "How long my lov'd Colin" she cry'd  "How long must thy Lucy complain  "How long shall the grave my love hide  "How long ere it join us again  "For thee thy fond shepherdess liv'd  "With thee o'er the world would she fly  "For thee has she sorrow'd and griev'd  "For thee would she lie down and die  IV  "Alas what avails it how dear  "Thy Lucy was once to her swain  "Her face like the lily so fair  "And eyes that gave light to the plain  "The shepherd that lov'd her is gone  "That face and those eyes charm no more  "And Lucy forgot and alone  "To death shall her Colin deplore"  V  While thus she lay sunk in despair  And mourn'd to the echoes around  Inflam'd all at once grew the air  And thunder shook dreadful the ground  "I hear the kind call and obey  "Oh Colin receive me" she cry'd  Then breathing a groan o'er his clay  She hung on his tombstone and dy'd  SONG XII  I  FOR a shape and a bloom and an air and a mien  Myrtilla was brightest of all the gay green  But artfully wild and affectedly coy  Those her beauties invited her pride would destroy  II  By the flocks as she stray'd with the nymphs of the vale  Not a shepherd but woo'd her to hear his soft tale  Tho' fatal the passion she laugli'd at the swain  And return'd with neglect what she heard with disdain  III  But beauty has wings and too hastily flies  And love unrewarded soon sickens and dies  The nymph cur'd by time of her folly and pride  Now sighs in her turn for the bliss she deny'd  IV  No longer she frolicks it wide o'er the plain  To kill with her coyness the languishing swain  So humbled her pride is so soften'd her mind  That tho' courted by none she to all would be kind  SONG XIII  I  WHEN Damon languish'd at my feet  And I believ'd him true  The moments of delight how sweet  But ah how swift they flew  The sunny hill the flow'ry vale  The garden and the grove  Have echo'd to his ardent tale  And vows of endless love  II  The conquest gain'd he left his prize  He left her to complain  To talk of joy with weeping eyes  And measure time by pain  But Heav'n will take the mourner's part  In pity to despair  And the last sigh that rends the heart  Shall wast the spirit there  CONTENTS  The
