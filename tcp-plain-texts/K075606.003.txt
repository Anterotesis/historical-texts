HISTORICAL  THE THIRD VOLUME  LONDON PRINTED BY AND FOR J NICHOLS RED LION PASSAGE FLEETSTREET MDCCLXXX  A SELECT COLLECTION OF MISCELLANY POEMS  THE EAGLE AND THE ROBIN  The political moral of this little apologue is too evident to need any other comment than barely mentioning that the lady was Queen Anne desiring the reader to recollect the change which she made in her ministry in the year in which this poem was written and referring to Dr King's "Rufinus or the Favourite" in the English Poets vol XX  N  An APOLOGUE translated from the Original of AESOP written Two Thousand Years since and now rendered in familiar Verse by  H G  L Mag  GOOD precepts and true gold are more valuable for their antiquity And here I present my good reader with one delivered by the first founder of mythology Aesop himself Maximus Planudes takes notice of it as a very excellent part of his production and Phaedrus Camerarius and others seem to agree that his Eagle and five others not yet translated are equal to  any of his that are handed down to us Though Mr Ogleby and Sir Roger L'Estrange had the unhappiness to be unacquainted with them yet I had the good fortune to discover them by the removal of my old library which has made me amends for the trouble of getting to where I now teach They were written or dictated at least by Aesop in the fiftyfourth Olympiad and though I designed them chiefly for the use of my school this being translated by a youth designed for a Greek professor yet no man is so wise as not to need instruction aye and by the way of fable too since the Holy Scriptures themselves the best instructors teach us by way of parable symbol image and figure and David was more moved with Nathan's "Thou art the man" than all the most rigid lectures in the world would have done Whoever will be at the trouble of comparing this version with the original let them begin at the tenth line and they will find it metaphrastically done  verbum verbo  as the best way of justice to the author Those that are meer adorers of  will not be angry that it is in this sort of metre for which I gave leave the lad having a turn to this sort of measure which is pleasant and agreeable though not lofty For my own part I concur with my master Aristotle that  are very far from being unnecessary or unpleasant May this be of use to thee and it will please thine in all good wishes  HORAT GRAM  THE EAGLE AND THE ROBIN  BY DR KING  To the works of this excellent Humourist which were first collected in I prefixed some Memoirs of his Life which have since been so elegantly epitomized that it would be superfluous to enlarge on this article Some extracts from his last biographer shall therefore supply the place  "William King was born in London in the son of Ezekiel King a gentleman He was allied to the family of Clarendon From Westminsterschool where he was a scholar on the foundation under the care of Dr Busby he was at eighteen elected to Christchurch in In he was made master of arts and engaging in the study of the Civil Law became doctor in and was admitted advocate at Doctors CommonsThough he was a regular advocate in the courts of civil and canon law he did not love his profession nor indeed any kind of business which interrupted his voluptuary dreams or forced him to rouse from that indulgence in which only he could find delight His reputation as a civilian was yet maintained by his judgements in the courts of Delegates and raised very high by the address and knowledge which he discovered in when he defended the earl of Anglesea against his lady afterwards dutchess of Buckinghamshire who sued for a divorce and obtained it The expence of his pleasures and neglect of business had now lessened his revenues and he was willing to accept of a settlement in Ireland where about he was made judge of the admiralty commissioner of the prizes keeper of the records in Birmingham's tower and vicargeneral to Dr Marsh the primate But it is vain to put wealth within the reach of him who will not stretch out his hand to take it King soon found a friend as idle and thoughtless as himself in Upton one of the judges who had a pleasant house called Mountown near Dublin to which King frequently retired delighting to neglect his interest forget his cares and desert his duty Here he wrote "Mully of Mountown" a poem by which though fanciful readers in the pride of sagacity have given it a political interpretation was meant originally no more than it expressed as it was dictated only by the author's delight in the quiet of Mountown In when lord Wharton was sent to govern Ireland King returned to London with his poverty his idleness and his wit In competence if not plenty was again put into his power He was without the trouble of attendance or the mortification of a request made gazetteer He was now again  laced in a profitable employment and again threw the benefit away An Act of Insolvency made his business at that time particularly troublesome and he would not wait till hurry should be at an end but impatiently resigned it and returned to his wonted indigence and amusements One of his amusements at Lambeth where he resided was to mortify Dr Tennison the archbishop by a publick festivity on the surrender of Dunkirk to Hill an event with which Tennison's political bigotry did not suffer him to be delighted King was resolved to counteract his sullenness and at the expence of a few barrels of ale filled the neighbourhood with honest merriment In the autumn of his health declined he grew weaker by degrees and died on Christmasday Though his life had not been without irregularity his principles were pure and orthodox and his death was pious After this relation it will be naturally supposed that his poems were rather the amusements of idleness than efforts of study that he endeavoured rather to divert than astonish that his thoughts seldom aspired to sublimity and that if his verse was easy and his images familiar he attained what he desired His purpose is to be merry though perhaps to enjoy his mirth it may be sometimes necessary to think well of his opinions"  I need not repeat that this is quoted from Dr Johnson  The poems which are now presented to the reader are none of them in the late collection of the English Poets N  OF THE COMMONS NOT PRINTED IN HIS WORKS  A LADY liv'd in former days  That well deserv'd the utmost praise  For greatness birth and justice fam'd  And every virtue could be nam'd  Which made her course of life so even  That she's a Saint if dead in Heaven  This Lady had a little seat  Just like a palace 'twas so neat  From aught but goodness her retreat  One morning in her giving way  As was her custom every day  To cheer the poor the sick and cold  Or with apparel food or gold  There came a gazing stranger by  On whom she quickly cast an eye  The man admiring made a stand  He had a bird upon his hand  " What's that says she that hangs its head  Sinking and faint 'Tis almost dead"  " Madam a Redbreast that I found  By this wet season almost drown'd"  " Oh bring him in and keep him warm  Robins do never any harm"  They soon obey'd and chopt him meat  Gave him whatever he would eat  The Lady care herself did take  And made a nest for Robin's sake  But he perkt up into her chair  In which he plenteously did fare  Assuming quite another air  The neighbours thought when this they spy'd  The world well mended on his side  With welltun'd throat he whistled long  And every body lik'd his song  " At last said they this little thing  Will kill itself so long to sing  We 'll closet him among the rest  Of those my Lady loves the best"  They little thought that saw him come  That Robins were so quarrelsome  The door they open'd in he pops  And to the highest perch he hops  The partycolour'd birds he chose  The Goldfinches and such as those  With them he'd peck and bill and feed  And very well at times agreed  Canarybirds were his delight  With them he'd  têteàtête  all night  But the brown Linnets went to pot  He kill'd them all upon the spot  The servants were employ'd each day  Instead of work to part some fray  And wish'd the aukward fellow curst  That brought him to my Lady first  At last they all resolv'd upon 't  Some way to tell my Lady on 't  Meanwhile he 'd had a noble swing  And rul'd just like the Gallic king  Having kill'd or wounded all  Unless the Eagle in the hall  With whom he durst but only jar  He being the very soul of war  But hated him for his desert  And bore him malice at his heart  This Eagle was my Lady's pride  The guardian safety of her side  He often brought home foreign prey  Which humbly at her feet he lay  For colour pinions and stature  The fairest workmanship of nature  'Twould do one good to see him move  So full of grandeur grace and love  He was indeed a bird for Jove  He soar'd aloft in Brucum's field  And thousand Kites and Vultures kill'd  Which made him dear to all that flew  Unless to Robin and his crew  One day poor Bob puff'd up with pride  Thinking the combat to abide  A goosequill on for weapon ty'd  Knowing by use that now and then  A sword less hurt does than a pen  As for exampleWhat at home  You 've well contriv'd to do at Rome  A pen blows upbefore you come  You are suppos'd to undermine  The foein some immense design  A pen can bite you with a line  There's forty ways to give a sign  Wellall on fire away he stalk'd  Till come towhere the Eagle walk'd  Bob did not shillI shallI go  Nor said one word of friend or foe  But flirting at him made a blow  As gamecocks with their gauntlets do  At which the Eagle gracefully  Cast a disdaining sparkling eye  As who should sayWhat 's this a flie  But no revenge at all did take  He spar'd him for their Lady's sake  Who ponder'd these things in her mind  And took the conduct of the Eagle kind  Upon reflection nowto shew  What harm the least of things may do  Mad Robin with his cursed flirt  One of the Eagle's  amongst the Greeks signifies  "Honour as tender as the eye"  KING  eyes had hurt  Inflam'd it made it red and sore  But the affront inslam'd it more  Oh how the family did tear  To fire the house could scarce forbear  With scorn not pain the Eagle fir'd  Murmur'd disdain and so retir'd  Robin to offer some relief  In words like these would heal their grief  " Should th' Eagle die which Heaven forbid  We ought some other to provide  I do not say that any now  Are fit but in a year or two  And should this mighty warrior fall  They should not want a General"  As men have long observ'd that one  Misfortune seldom comes alone  Just in the moment this was done  Ten thousand foes in sight were come  Vultures and Kites and birds of prey  In flocks so thickthey darken'd day  A longconcerted force and strong  Vermin of all kinds made the throng  Foxes were in the faction join'd  Who waited their approach to ground  By every hand from common fame  The frightful face of danger came  One cries "What help nowwho can tell  I'm glad the Eagle 's here and well"  Another out of breath with fear  Says "Thousands more near sea appear  They'll swop our Chicken from the door  We never were so set before  We're glad the Eagle will forget  And the invaders kill or beat"  Reserv'd and great his noble mind  Above all petty things inclin'd  Abhorr'd the thoughts of any thing  But what his Lady's peace could bring  Who bless'd him first and bade him do  As he was wont and beat the foe  Burning and restless as the sun  Until this willing work was done  He whets his talons stretch'd his wings  His lightning darts and terror flings  Towers with a flight into the sky  These million monsters to descry  Prepar'd to conquer or to die  The party that so far was come  Thought not the Eagle was at home  To fame and danger us'd in field  They knew he'd quickly make them yield  But on assurance he was near  Incumber'd faint and dead with fear  They made with hurry towards the lakes  And he his pinions o'er them shakes  They had not with such horror fill'd  The courage to let one be kill'd  They fled and left no foe behind  Unless it were the fleeting wind  Onlya man by water took  Two fine young Merlins and a Rook  The family had now repose  But with the sun the Eagle rose  Th' imperial bird pursued the foe  More toil than rest inur'd to know  He wing'd his way to Latian land  Where first was hatch'd this murdering band  He darted death wheree'er he came  Some of them dying at his name  Their mighty foea fatal pledge  Their bowels tore through every hedge  They flutter shriek and caw and hiss  Their strength decays and fears increase  But most the chevaliers the Geese  So many slaughter'd fowl there was  Their carcases block'dup the ways  The rest he drove half spent pellmell  Quite to the walls of Pontifell  Robin at home though mad to hear  He should so conquer every where  Expostulated thus with fear  " Ungrateful I that so have stirr'd  Against this generous noble bird  Wast thou not first by him preferr'd  Let's leave him in his gall to burn  And back to Pontifell return"  There some to chimneytops aspire  To turrets some that could fly higher  Some 'bove a hundred miles were gone  To roost them at Byzantium  Alas in vain was their pretence  He broke through all their strong defence  Down went their fences wires and all  Perches and birds together fall  None hop'd his power to withstand  But gave the nest to his command  They told him of ten thousand more  In flocks along the Ganges' shore  Safe in their furrows free from trouble  Like Partridges among the stubble  He spreads himself and cuts the air  And steady flight soon brought him there  Lord how deceiv'd and vex'd he was  To find they were but meer Jackdaws  A hundred thousand all in light  They all could chatter not one fight  " I'll deal by them as is their due  " Shough cry'd the Eagle off they flew"  His flashing eyes their hearts confounds  Though by their flight secure from wounds  Which was a signal fatal baulk  To a late swift Italian Hawk  The Eagle would no rest afford  Till he had sent my Lady word  Who when she heard the dear surprize  Wonder and joy stood in her eyes  " My faithful Eagle hast thou then  My moral foes destroy'd again  Return return and on me wait  Be thou the guardian of my gate  Thee and thy friends are worth my care  Thy foes if any such there are  Shall my avenging anger share"  Solest new ills should intervene  She turn'd the Robin out again  The Samians now in vast delight  Bless their good lady day and night  Wish that her life might ne'er be done  But everlasting as the sun  The Eagle high again did soar  The Lady was disturb'd no more  But all things flourish'd as before  ROBIN RED BREAST WITH THE BEASTS AN OLD CAT'S PROPHECY  Taken out of an old copy of Verses supposed to be writ by JOHN LIDGATE a Monk of Bury  BY DR KING NOT PRINTED IN HIS WORKS  ONE that had in her infant state  While playing at her Father's gate  Seen and was most hugely smitten  With young Dog and dirty Kitten  Had took them up and lug'd them in  And made the servants wash them clean  The political drift of this pretended prophecy is still more evident than that of the preceding poem the satire being abundantly more personal N    When she to a fit age was grown  To be sole Mistress of her own  Then to her favour and strange trust  She rais'd these two in rank the first  The Dog who with gilt collar grac'd  Strutted about The cat was plac'd  O'er all the house to domineer  And kept each wight of her in fear  While he o'er all the plains had power  That savage Wolves might not devour  Her flocks She gave him charge great care  To take but beasts uncertain are  Now see by these what troubles rise  To those who in their choice unwise  Put trust in such for he soon join'd  With beast of prey the Dog combin'd  Who kill'd the Sheep and tore the Hind  While he would stand and grin and bark  Concealing thus his dealings dark  A Wolf or so sometimes he'd take  And then O what a noise he'd make  But with wild beasts o'errun yet are  The plains some die for want of fare  Or torn or kill'd the shepherds find  Each day are lost of every kind  Thy silly Sheep lament in vain  Of their hard fate not him complain  The shepherds and the servants all  Against the traitor loudly bawl  But there was none that dar'd to tell  Their lady what to them besel  For Puss a Fox of wondrous art  Broughtin to help and take their part  By whose assistance to deceive  She made her every lye believe  One lucky day when she was walking  In her woods with servants talking  And stopp'd to hear how very well  A Redbreast sung then him to dwell  With her she call'd he came and took  His place next to a favourite Rook  Where Robin soon began to sing  Such songs as made the house to ring  He sung the loss and death of Sheep  In notes that made the Lady weep  How for his charge the Dog unfit  Took part with foes and shepherds bit  Ev'n from his birth he did him trace  And shew him cur of shabby race  The first by wandering beggars fed  His sire advanc'd turn'd spit for bread  Himself each trust had still abus'd  To steal what he should guard was us'd  From puppy known wheree'er he came  Both vile and base and void of shame  The Cat he sung that none could match  For venom'd spite or cruel scratch  That from a Witch transform'd she came  Who kitten'd three of equal fame  This first one dead of tabby fur  The third survives much noise of her  Had been a Cat well known with ease  On errands dark o'er land and seas  She'd journies take to cub of Bear  From these intriguing beasts who swear  They'll bring him to defend the wrong  That they have done Again he sung  How Tabby once in moonlight night  Trotted with letter Fox did write  In which he sends his best respects  To the Shebear and thus directs  " Madam said he your cub safe send  " None shall his worship soon offend  " It 's all I can at present do  " To serve him as his friends well know"  At this the beasts grew in such rage  That none their fury coul  assuage  Nay Puss her Lady would have scratch'd  And tore her eyes but she was watch'd  For she 'd set up her back and mew  And thrice ev'n in her face she flew  The Dog like an ungrateful spark  At her would dare to snarl and bark  Her tenants wondering stood to hear  That she their insolence would bear  And offer'd their assistance to  Soon make them better manners know  But she to avoid all farther rout  Her window opening turn'd Bob out  Hoping that then her beasts would live  In peace and no disturbance give  Yet nothing she can do avails  Their rage against her still prevails  Though Puss was warn'd to fear their fate  In lines by old prophetic Cat  Writ before her transformation  When she was in the Witch's station  Foretelling thus "When beasts are grown  " To certain heights before unknown  " Of human race some shall aloud  " Inflame and arm a dreadful crowd  " Who in vast numbers shall advance  " And to new tunes shall make them dance  " When this begins no longer hope  " For all remains is ax and rope"  But not deterr'd by this they dar'd  With some who of their plunder shar'd  T' affront their Lady and conspire  To many with her money hire  Contemning her to pay undue  Regards unto this bestial crew  Though these resembled human shapes  They were indeed no more than Apes  Who some in house and some in wood  And others in high boxes stood  That chattering made such noise and stir  How all was due to Fox and Cur  Till by their false deluding way  She found her flocks begin to stray  Still Robin does for her his care  And zeal express on whom yet are  His thoughts all fix'd On her he dreams  Each night Her praises are his themes  In songs all day Now perch'd on tree  Finding himself secure and free  He pertly shakes his little wings  Sets up his throat again he sings  " That she had left no other way  To save her flocks and end this fray  But soon to her assistance take  One who could make these monsters shake  A wellknown huntsman who has skill  The fiercest beasts to tame or kill  At her command he'd come and he  Would make her great and set them free  That should these beasts some evil day  Bring Cub into her grounds she may  Depend that not herself they'll spare  Since to insult her now they dare  All she at best can hope for then  Is to be safe shut up in de    Since by sure signs all these ingrate  Are known to bear her deadly hate"  He ends his song and prays to Heaven  That she may have the wisdom given  Before it be too late to take  Such resolutions as may make  Her safe and that these beasts no more  To ravage in the plains have power  BIBLIOTHECA A POEM OCCASIONED BY THE SIGHT OF A MODERN LIBRARY WITH SOME VERY USEFUL EPISODES AND DIGRESSIONS  PROBABLY BY THE SAME  This is ascribed to Dr King upon conjecture only It was published in the winter before he died by  his  bookseller inscribed to  his  patron and is very much in  his  manner His name is accordingly affixed to the author's notes The poem is on many accounts worth preserving and if it is not Dr King's it is at least  not  by an  inferior  writer N    Ridiculum acri  " Fortius et melius magnas plerunque secat res  "Utile dulci"  HOR  To the most noble Prince HENRY Duke of Beaufort Marquis and Earl of Worcester Earl of Glamorgan Baron Herbert Lord of Chepstow Ragland and Gower and the illustrious Brotherhood  The duke was captain of the band of gentlemen pensioners N  over which his Grace presides this POEM is humbly dedicated by their most obedient most dutiful and humble servant  BIBLIOTHECA  Though the interests of Virtue and Religion are best secured by the severest reason and argument yet I hope a less solemn recommendation of them to the world may not be esteemed a prejudice to either How oft has a stubborn folly been successfully arraigned by a candid and easy rebuke which had long maintained itself against a more powerful though a less familiar conviction If we can smile away the follies of an adversary sport with his vanities and laugh him into a sense of his errors why should we forfeit that exquisite pleasure of complacency and goodhumour which a malicious conflict with a rival would most certainly deprive us of If we miscarry in an attempt of this nature our defeat would be the less dishonourable because we seemed only to play and trifle with the mistakes of an author but should we under the mask of a little raillery wit and goodhumour obtain our end it would double our satisfaction as well as the glory of our conquest Two important debates of the utmost consequence in religion Eachard's Contempt of the Clergy and Philautus and Timothy have with wonderful applause lately appeared in the world the beauties of their author's stile the purity of their diction the elegant turn of thought and above all a torrent of severe but goodnatured wit drew a thousand readers to peruse an hypothesis they little imagined ever to espouse but they were insensibly deluded into good principles and betrayed into a conviction of those very truths they came on purpose to deride and ridicule Where they expected to gratify a fancy only they found a more real advantage in the reformation of their judgement and from admirers of the author's wit and beauties became at last proselytes to their opinions If in two or three instances I have transgressed my own rules the Fool or the Knave must be imagined very notorious and that those tender and merciful lashes that were judged sufficient for little offenders would hardly have reached the vanities of the one or the villainies of the other And if I am thought to have injured any person in his character or to have said as much as I am able I must beg leave to assure the world that it was owing to abundance of humanity and goodnature I did not say a great deal more and would rather advise them to sit easy and quiet under the innocent rebukes of a satire than provoke others to prepare that correction which their ignorance their impudence or both have so justly deserved KING    THE tea was sipp'd Ocella gone  To regulate affairs alone  When from the marriage lumber freed  The Doctor with himself decreed  To nodor much the same to read  He always seem'd a wondrous lover  Of painted leaf and Turky cover  While no regard at all was had  To sots in homely russet clad  Concluding he must be within  A calf that wore without his skin  Scott  John Scott DD author of the Christian Life vols R  if in rags was not admir'd  While Lacy  A whimsical odd fellow and a preacher among the Camisars KING Lacy was one of those enthusiasts who supported the French prophets R  seem'd as much inspir'd  And in rich purple nicely drest  Discours'd as saintly as the best  Great Sherlock Barrow and those few  That teach our passions to subdue  Without gilt backs he would despise  Which seem'd at best but dully wise  And Bunyan's Pilgrim shew'd the way  To Paradise as well as they  But though his thoughts were fix'd to read  The treatise was not yet decreed  Uncertain to devote the day  To politicks or else to play  What theme would best his genius suit  Grave morals or a dull dispute  Where both contending champions boast  The victory which neither lost  As Chiefs are oft in story read  Each to pursue when neither fled  See the battle of Mons KING    He enters now the shining dome  Where crouded authors sweat for room  So close a man could hardly say  Which were more fixt the shelves or they  Each with his golden title tells  Its author's name and where he dwells  And to enlarge his credit more  Directs us to his very door  Boasting of wonders to be seen  If we have faith to look within  To please the eye the highest space  A fett of wooden volumes grace  Pure timber authors that contain  As much as some that boast a brain  That Alma Mater never view'd  Without degrees to writers hew'd  Yet solid thus just emblems shew  Of the dull brotherhood below  Smiling their rivals to survey  As great and real blocks as they  Distinguish'd then in even rows  Here shines the Verse and there the Prose  For though Britannia fairer looks  United 'tis not so with books  The champions of each different art  Had stations all assign'd apart  Fearing the rival chiefs might be  For quarrels still nor dead agree  The Schoolmen first in long array  Their bulky lumber round display  Seem'd to lament their wretched doom  And heave for more convenient room  While doctrine each of weight contains  To crack his shelves as well as brains  Since all with him were thought to dream  That flagg'd before they fill'd a rheam  His authors wisely taught to prize  Not for their merit but their size  No surer method ever found  Than buying writers by the pound  For Heaven must needs his breast inspire  That scribbling fill'd each month a quire  And claim'd a station on his shelves  Who scorn'd each sot who fool'd in twelves  Say Goddess thou that tak'st delight  To live and lodge with folks that write  What numbers justly may describe  The orders of the learned tribe  Fierce wits that long at variance stood  And drew much ink but little blood  Each other's pardon now implore  The cudgels drop and snarl no more  And filling now the selfsame place  No longer combat but embrace  Here vanquish'd Bentley dreading still  The force of Boyle's victorious quill  All suppliant now devoutly swore  He ne'er would question Aesop more  But own each page authentic stood  Some centuries before the flood  Who though the tyrant's bull of brass  Did for a mighty wonder pass  On purpose wrote to have it known  He made much bigger of his own  Dr King's very humourous "Dialogues of the Dead" are particularly leveled against this colossal critic N    Maurus  Sir Richard Blackmore N  and Garth their feuds survive  And here in endless friendship live  Kindly concording now impart  Their healing power and rhyming art  Unrival'd heroes both confest  To close a life or break a jest  And  bath  with  both  Apollo 's  The God of Medicine and of Verse N  blest  But who can mention Maurus' name  Without a line to crown his fame  Upon whose brows inspiring hung  Large poppy wreaths whene'er he sung  Whose kindred rhymes their nature keep  Gently disposing folks to sleep  Then say great Mirror of our Time  Not half so fam'd for cures as rhyme  Why should'st thou other means pursue  To heal with drugs when verse will do  Five tender distichs from those strains  Where Arthur moans and Job complains  Shall ever boast a power to steep  The wakeful'st eyes in downy sleep  When strongest opiates nought avail  Prescribe thy Muse 'twill never fail  Ne'er trouble physick with a cure  Each page of thine will work as sure  With whatsoever ills opprest  'Tis sure to give thy patient rest  See next the Mantuan Bard appears  And in his hand th' Aeneid bears  Ten thousand laurels round him spread  Bloom ready to adorn his head  Their greens too languid to bestow  That fame which to his verse we owe  Such magick fills each heavenly line  We read and reading grow divine  Conscious we feel the extacy  And seem inspir'd as well as he  With him we soaring gain the skies  Yet know not whence or how we rise  But see what clouds of sullen woe  Sadly obscure his laurel'd brow  While the bright glory that surrounds  His sacred head his sorrow drowns  In vain the weeping Muse essays  To ease his grief with proffer'd bays  Though fam'd beyond the starry sky  She vow'd th' Aeneid ne'er should die  But while we thus his grief explore  Oh view the cause nor wonder more  See closely fixt on either hand  His two translators  Ogilby and Lauderdale KING To the latter of these translators however Mr Dryden was considerably indebted N  near him stand  Oblig'd to hear them both rehearse  His wondrous song in doggrel verse  Thus doom'd to all succeeding times  To gingle in dull British rhymes  " He never thought great bard to see  " His Roman ladies sipping tea  " Divine Lavinia taking snuff  " Or grave Aeneas charge in buff  " Against his Latian foes advance  " With musket now instead of launce  " While mighty Turnus owes his fall  " Not to a javelin but a ball  " Shot through the belly in the fray  " Expiring a genteeler way"  Had Withers Shirley or the good  Laureat of Cambridge near him stood  No wrinkle had been seen nay more  Even Rll's self he could have bore  Where Nature taking wondrous pains  To furnish guts ne'er thought of brains  But doom'd to perish by a foe  Yet hug the arm that gave the blow  A fate was look'd on too severe  For Heaven to fix or him to bear  So much unlike appear'd their strains  To those he sung on Lat  an plains  Begging their readers to dispense  With pretty cuts instead of sense  That from those lines their pencil drew  Scarce his own self great Maro knew  Till honest Loggan  An engraver of singular eminence N  let him see  In copperplates it must be he  No longer then he could refuse  But from the cuts confess'd the Muse  Oh who can view without a tear  Great Pindar's Muse and D'Urfey near  Whose soaring wit ne'er higher flew  Than to endite for Barthol'mew  Setting for sots at country fairs  Dull bawdy songs to Purcell's airs  But here how sweetly they combine  Their fancies club and numbers join  While the bold Grecian nobly sings  Of gods of heroes and of kings  And something more than mortal fire  Exalts his voice and warms his lyre  That fir'd with each transporting page  We feel his heat and catch his rage  While each immortal warrior's name  His Muse transmits to deathless fame  Green wreaths upon their hearse bestows  And every wound immortal grows  But much oh very much below  Our meek Pindaricks gently flow  In soft and easy metre creep  And just oblige us not to sleep  While lovers storm and heroes weep  Let thy dull Pegasus no more  To Lyric song attempt to soar  Nor with thy weight presume to rise  With rival strength above the skies  Which trots much better than he flies  Let Pindar's Muse record the flames  Of heavenly nymphs celestial dames  Be thou content to whine and tell  How Strephon charm'd and Phyllis fell  Or with that willow grace thy song  Where late despairing Chloe hung  While the fad tree the story owns  Sprouting each May with sighs and groans  Which fann'd with Zephyrs never fail  To waft abroad the doleful tale  And shall to future times remain  Sacred to Love and Chloe slain  Bright heroes in thy list shall stand  In modern brunts that held command  Whose bold adventures shall outshine  The heroes all of Caesar's line  Brave Arthur and his daring crew  Shall kill each mother's son they view  And great Pendragon's fatal blade  Convert each foe into a shade  Guy for Alcides shall command  And Highgate for Olympus stand  See next in purple seated high  A dazzling Wit  De Foe He wrote a dull scandalous libel on all the English nobility called "The trueborn Englishman" KING  attracts the eye  Inviting with his radiant hue  If not to read at least to  view  Though his dark lowering aspect shews  That Nature meant the fool for prose  To waste his little sense and time  In broaching any thing but rhyme  Yet by degrees the wretch arose  To trade in verse from vending hose  De Foe's first profession N    And still in Nature's spite thinks meet  Though not in  socks  to deal in  feet  The toothless satire that he writes  No other but its author bites  Like those mistaken curs of yore  That for the stag their master tore  Where harmless pun and witty clinch  Mumble sometimes but never pinch  And aiming at a wound are sure  To give us smiles and work our cure  Hadst thou no other damning crime  Justice might fairly urge

Sermon preached in St George's Chapel within her Majesty's Castle of Windsor on Sunday the th of June By Thomas Goddard AM Canon of Windsor London printed for B Lintot " Mr Goddard was installed canon May and was also rector of St Bennet Finch London He published a th of January Sermon in to and "The Mercy of God to this Church and Kingdom exemplified in the several Instances of it from the Beginning of the Reformation down to the present Time A Sermon preached in St George's Chapel at Windsor on Tuesday the th of November the Day of Thanksgiving " vo They were all reprinted in with three others under the title of "Six Sermons on several Occasions" vo N    WRITTEN BY DR KING IN THE CHARACTER OF "THE REVIEW"  TO Windsor Canon his wellchosen Friend  The just Review does kindest greeting send  I've found the man by nature's gift design'd  To please my ear and captivate my mind  By sympathy the eager passions move  And strike my soul with wonder and with love  Happy that place where much less care is had  To save the virtuous than protect the bad  Where Pastors must their stubborn Flock obey  Or that be thought a scandal which they say  For should a sin by some grand soul belov'd  Chance with an aukward zeal to be reprov'd  And tender conscience meet the fatal curse  Of hardening by reproof and growing worse  When things to such extremities are brought  'Tis not the Sinner's but the Teacher's fault  With Great Mens' wickedness then rest content  And give them their own leisure to repent  Whilst their own headstrong will alone must curb them  And nothing vex or venture to disturb them  Lest they should lose their favour in the court  And no one but themselves be sorry for't  Were I in panegyrick vers'd like you  I'd bring whole offerings to your merit due  You've gain'd the conquest and I freely own  Dissenters may by Churchmen be outdone  Though once we seem'd to be at such a Distance  Yet both concenter in Divine resistance  Both teach what Kings must do when subjects fight  And both disclaim Hereditary Right  By Jove's command two Eagles took their flight  One from the East the source of infant light  The other from the West that bed of night  The birds of thunder both at Delphi meet  The centre of the world and Wisdom's seat  So by a Power not decent here to name  To one fixt point our various notions came  Your thoughts from Oxford and from Windsor flew  Whilst Shop and Meetinghouse brought forth Review  A wellknown political paper by De Foe in which Mr Goddard's Sermon was immoderately commended See a long account of this writer and of Ridpath and Tutchin his associates in the "Supplement to Swift" N    Your brains fierce Eloquence and Logick tried  My humbler strain choice Socks and Stockings cried  Yet in our common principles we

APPLEPYE  This poem hath been claimed as Mr Welsted's in "The Weekly Oracle" August with a remark that  "Dr King the Civilian a gentleman of no mean reputation in the world of letters let it pass some years without contradiction as his own"  It is in King's manner N    PROBABLY BY THE SAME  OF all the delicates which Britons try  To please the palate or delight the eye  Of all the several kinds of sumptuous fare  There 's none that can with Applepye compare  For costly flavour or substantial paste  For outward beauty or for inward taste  When first this infantdish in fashion came  Th' ingredients were but coarse and rude the frame  As yet unpolish'd in the modern arts  Our fathers eat Brownbread instead of Tarts  Pyes were but indigasted lumps of dough  Till time and just expence

And cease not to fatigue your Rollingpin  Of Eggs and Butter see you mix enough  For then the Paste will swell into a Puff  Which will in crumpling sounds your praise report  And eat as housewives speak "exceeding short"  Rang'd in thick order let your Quinces lie  They give a charming relish to the Pye  If you are wise you 'll not Brown Sugar slight  The browner if I form my judgement right  A deep Vermillion tincture will dispense  And make your Pippin redder than the Quince  When this is done there will be wanting still  The just reserve of Cloves and Candied Peel  Nor can I blame you if a drop you take  Of Orangewater for perfumingsake  But here the nicety of art is such  There must not be too little nor too much  If with discretion you these costs employ  They quicken appetite if not they cloy  Next in your mind this maxim firmly root  " Never o'ercharge your Pye with costly fruit"  Oft let your Bodkin through the lid be sent  To give the kind imprison'd treasure vent  Lest the fermenting liquor closely prest  Insensibly by constant fretting waste  And o'erinform your tenement of paste  To chuse your Baker think and think again  You 'll scarce one honest Baker find in ten  Adust and bruis'd I've often seen a Pye  In rich disguise and costly ruin lie  While pensive crust beheld its form o'erthrown  Exhausted Apples griev'd their moisture flown  And Syrup from the sides ran trickling down  O be not be not tempted lovely Nell  While the hotpiping odours strongly smell  While the delicious fume creates a gust  To lick the o'erflowing juice or bite the crust  You 'll rather stay if my advice may rule  Until the hot's corrected by the cool  Till you 've infus'd the luscious store of Cream  And chang'd the purple for a silver stream  Till that smooth viand its mild force produce  And give a softness to the tarter juice  Then shalt thou pleas'd the noble fabrick view  And have a slice into the bargain too  Honour and fame alike we will partake  So well I'll

for the political integrity of his character and the spirit with which he resisted the tyrant of his country than for the abilities which he displayed as a writer He was born Jan and at an early age travelled with Dr Killigrew afterwards master of the Savoy who gave him a just and true relish of poetry and all the refinements of wit and sense He joined the party which opposed the arbitrary proceedings of Charles the Second and was very active in all the measures which were adopted against that monarch and his successor James the Second On the death of his father on the d of November he succeeded him in the title of Earl of Devonshire and soon after becam  a principal promoter of the Revolution being one o  those who secretly planned it and took up arms to carry th  design into execution On the accomplishment of that im+portant event he received the rewards which his service  merited and was on the th of April create  Marquis of Hartington and Duke of Devonshire He con+tinued to enjoy the favour of his sovereign until the time o  his death which happened on the th of August i  the th year of his age Mr Walpole observes that h  was  "a patriot among the men galant among the ladie  His friendship with Lord Russell his free spirit hi  bravery duels honours amours are well known an  his epitaph will never be forgotten  " WILLIELMUS DUX DEVONIAE  " BONORUM PRINCIPUM SUBDITUS FIDELIS  " INIMICUS ET INVISUS TYRANNIS"  R      CAMBRAY whilst of Seraphic Love you write  The noblest themes you set in clearest light  A love by no selfinterest debas'd  But on th' Almighty's high perfection plac'd  A love in which true piety consists  That soars to Heaven without the help of priests  Let partial Rome the great attempt oppose  Support the cheat from whence her income flows  Her censures may condemn but not confute  If best your elevated notions suit  With what to reason seems th' Almighty's due  They have at least an air of being true  And what can animated clay produce  Beyond a guess in matters so abstruse  But when descending from the imperial height  You stoop of sublunary things to write  Minerva seems the moral to dispense  How great the subject how sublime the sense  Not the Alconian Bard with such a flame  E'er sung of ruling arts your lofty theme  In your Telemachus his hero's son  We see the great Original outdone  There is in Virtue sure a hidden charm  To force Esteem and Envy to disarm  Else in a flattering court you ne'er had been design'd  T' instruct the future troublers of mankind  Happy your native soil at least by nature so  In none her treasures more profusely flow  The hills adorn'd with vines with flowers the plain  Without the sun's too near approach serene  But Heaven in vain does on the vineyards smile  The monarch's glory mocks the labourer's toil  What though elaborate brass with nature strive  And proud equestrian figures seem alive  With various terrors on their basis wrought  With yielding citadels surpriz'd or bought  And here the ruins of a taken town  There a bombarded steeple tumbling down  Such prodigies of art and costly pains  Serve but to gild th' unthinking rabble's chains  Oh abject state of such as tamely groan  Under a blind dependency on one  How far inferior to the herds that range  With native freedom o'er the woods and plains  With them no fallacy of schools prevail  or of a right divine the nauseous tale  Can give to one amongst themselves a power  Without control his fellows to devour  To reasoning humankind alone belong  The arts to hurt themselves by reasoning wrong  Howe'er the foolish notion first began  Of trusting absolute to lawless man  Howe'er a tyrant may by force subsist  For who would be a slave that can resist  Those set the casuist safest on the throne  Who make the people's int'rest their own  And chusing rather to be lov'd than fear'd  Are kings of men not of a servile herd  Oh Liberty too late desir'd when lost  Like health when wanted thou art valued most  In regions where no property is known  Through which the Garone runs and rapid Rhone  Where peasants toil for harvests not their own  How gladly would they quit their native soil  And change for liberty their wine and oil  As wretches chain'd and labouring at the oar  In sight of Italy's delightful shoar  Reflect on their unhappy fate the more  Thy laws have still their force above the rest  Of Gothic kingdoms happy Albion blest  Long since their ancient freedom they have lost  And servilely of their subjection boast  Thy better fate the vain attempts resists  Of faithless monarchs and designing priests  Unshaken yet the government subsists  While streams of blood the continent o'erflow  Reddening the Maese the Danube and the Po  Thy Thames auspicious isle her thunder sends  To crush thy foes and to relieve her friends  Say Muse since no surprize or foreign stroke  Can hurt her guarded by her walls of oak  Since wholesome laws her liberty transfer  To future ages what can Albion fear  Can she the dearbought treasure throw away  Have Universities so great a sway  The Muse is silent cautious to reflect  On mansions where the Muses keep their seat  Barren of thought and niggardly of rhyme  My creeping numbers are forbid to climb  Venturing too far my weary genius fails  And o'er my drooping senses sleep prevails  An antique pile near Thames's silver stream  Was the first object of my airy dream  In ancient times a consecrated fane  But since apply'd to uses more prophane  Fill'd with a popular debating throng  Oft in the right and oftener in the wrong  Of good and bad the variable test  Where the religion that is voted best  Is still inclin'd to persecute the rest  On the high fabrick stood a monster fell  Of hideous form second to none in Hell  The Fury to be more abhorr'd and fear'd  Her teeth and jaws with clods of gore besmear'd  Her partycolour'd robe obscenely stain'd  With pious murthers freemen rack'd and chain'd  With the implacable and brutish rage  Of fierce dragoons sparing nor sex nor age  With all the horrid instruments of death  Of torturing innocents t' improve their faith  Clouding the roof with their infectious breath  Thus she began "Are then my labours vain  That to the powers of France have added Spain  Vain my attempts to make that empire great  And shall a woman my designs defeat  Baffle th' infernal projects I've begun  And break the measures of my favourite son  Though far unlike the heroes of her race  That made their humours of their laws take place  And slighting coronationoaths disdain'd  Their high prerogative should be restrain'd  Though her own isle is blest with liberty  Has she a right to set all Europe free  Under this roof with management I may  The progress of her arms at least delay  From a contagious vapour I shall blow  Within those walls breaches may wider grow  Another copy reads  " Here let imaginary fears prevail  " And give a colour to affected zeal"  N  Here let imaginary fears be shown  Of danger to the church when there is none  From trivial bills let warm debates arise  Foment sedition and retard supplies  If once my treacherous arts and watchful care  Break the Confederacy and end the war  Ador'd in Hell I may in triumph fit  And Europe to one potentate submit"  Waking at so detestable a sound  Which would all order and all peace confound  I cry'd "Infernal hag be ever dumb  Thee with her arms let Anna overcome  Who here reigns queen by Heaven on us bestow'd  To right the injur'd and subdue the proud  As Rome of old gave liberty to Greece

retreat  What lands thy warmer beams possest  What happy Indian worlds thy fruitful presence blest  Where deep in the dark bosom of the ground  Thy wondrous operation's found  Even there thy beams the earth refine  And mix and stamp thy lustre through the dazling mine  Since thy retreat so far from our cold isle  She never wore a lovely smile  No joy her wither'd brow adorn'd  In dark unlovely days and in long nights she mourn'd  The poor dejected beasts hung down their heads  And trembled on their naked beds  No footsteps of green life remain  But dying fields and woods and a bare bleaky plain  The drooping birds were silent in the groves  They quite forgot their songs and loves  Their feeble mates sate sullen by  We thought the feather'd world resolv'd their kind should die  But see the land revives at thy approach  She blooms and quickens at thy touch  Her kindled atoms life receive  The meadows and the groves begin to stir and live  Mixt with thy beams the southern breezes blow  And help the sprouting births below  The infant flowers in haste appear  And gratefully return perfumes to the kind air  The trees and fields again look fresh and gay  The birds begin their softer play  Thou hast their life nay more their love restor'd  Their late and early hymns praise thee their welcome Lord  The spreading fire glides through the plains and woods  It even pierces the cold floods  The duller brutes feel the soft flame  The fishes leap for joy and wanton in their stream  ON THE DUTCHESS OF PORTSMOUTH  Louise de Queroualle mistress to Charles II created dutchess Aug died

had been the Poet's boast  That all the world for Love had well been lost  THE DREAM BY MR J TALBOT  Who this J Talbot was I cannot discover but there was a translation of Seneca's Troas by J T published in and in a copy thrown out of Lord Bathurst's Library which I saw the last initial was filled up with the name of Talbot and I have no doubt but he is the same person R  OCCASIONED BY THE DEATH OF LADY SEYMOUR  Lady Elizabeth Seymour daughter to William lord Allington of Horsheath in the county of Cambridge she was the second lady of Charles lord Seymour of Trowbridge and mother to Francis and Charles successively dukes of Somerset This noble lady was afterwards married to Sir John Ernle knt chancellor of the exchequer N    IF righteous souls in their blest mansions know  Or what we do or suffer here below  And any leisure from their joys can find  To visit those whom they have left behind  To view our endless griefs our groundless fears  Our hopeless sorrows and our fruitless tears  With pity sure they see the kind mistake  Which weeping friends at their departure make  They wonder why at their release we grieve  And mourn their death who then begin to live  Tir'd with the care and sorrow of the day  In silent night the sad Maecenas lay  His mind still labouring with the deadly weight  Of his dear parent's muchlamented fate  Till weary Nature with its load opprest  Compos'd the tempest of his troubled breast  And borrow'd from his grief some time for rest  When sleep  This idea occurs in "Sable Night" a favourite song in "The Duenna" N  death's image to his fancy brought  The hourly object of his waking thought  And lo his mother's awful shade appears  Not pale and ghastly as the sullen fears  Of brainsick minds their dismal phantoms paint  But bright and joyful as a newmade saint  A crown of glories shone around her head  She smil'd and thus the happy spirit said  " Hail noble son whom powerful Fates design  To fill the glories of thy mighty line  In whom the good is mingled with the great  As generous light unites with active heat  For thee I thought life pleasant and for thee  I after death endur'd this world to see  And leave a while the dwellings of the blest  Where heavenly minds enjoy eternal rest  Where having reach'd the universal shore  I fear the winds and billows now no more  No more in anguish draw a painful breath  Nor wrestle with that mighty tyrant Death  Who cannot boast he gave the fatal blow  I conquer'd sin from whence his power did flow  The proud insulter threaten'd me in vain  For Heaven increas'd my patience with my pain  Till my unfetter'd soul at last took wing  The grave its conquest lost and death its sting  No longer then these pious sorrows shed  Nor vainly think thy happy parent dead  Whose deathless mind from its weak prison free  Enjoys in Heaven its native liberty  I soon distinguish'd in that blissful place  Thy godlike ancestors a numerous race  There plac'd among the stars in them I see  A glorious destiny reserv'd for thee  Then weep no more ev'n here I still survive  In thee and in thy virtuous fair I live  I saw her happy mother  Lady Elizabeth Audry wife to Josceline Percy the th earl of Northumberland and after his death married to Ralph lord Montagu afterwards created duke N  shine on high  A brighter spirit ne'er adorn'd the sky  With joy she met me at the crystal gate  And much inquir'd her beauteous daughter's state  She wish'd her there but Heaven ordains it late  And long defers her joys that she may be  A mighty blessing to this world and thee  Long shall she live and ages yet to come  Shall bless the happy burden of her womb  Still shall her offspring with her years increase  With both her virtues and thy happiness  In all thy race the wondering world shall find  The noble image of each parent's mind  Thus bless'd in her and hers thou shalt receive  The richest bounties Heaven and Earth can give  Nor shall my care be wanting to your aid  My faithful spirit shall hover o'er thy head  And round thy lovely fair a large protection spread  Till crown'd with years and honours here below  And every gift kind Nature can bestow  You both retire to everlasting rest  And late increase the joys and number of the blest"  She spake her fellowangels all around  With joyful smiles the happy omen own'd  All bless'd the noble pair and took their flight  To the bright regions of unfading light  ELEGY BY MR TALBOT OCCASIONED BY READING AND TRANSCRIBING MR WALLER'S "POEM OF DIVINE LOVE" AFTER HIS DEATH  SUCH were the last the sweetest notes that hung  Upon our dying swan's melodious tongue  Notes whose strong charms the dullest ear might move  And melt the hardest heart in flames of love  Notes whose seraphic raptures speak a mind  From human thoughts and earthly dross refin'd  So just their harmony so high their flight  With joy I read them and with wonder write  Sure happy Saint this noble song was given  To fit thee for th' approaching joys of Heaven  Love wondrous love whose conquest was thy theme  Has taught thy soul the airy way to climb  Love snatch'd thee like Elijah to the sky  In flames that not consume but purify  There with thy fellowangels mix'd and free  From the dull load of dim mortality  Thou feel'st new joys and feed'st thy ravish'd sight  With unexhausted beams of love and light  And sure bless'd spirit to compleat thy bliss  In Heaven thou sing'st this song or one like this  AGAINST SLOTH WHEN THE KING WAS AT OXFORD  " Hoc agite ô Juvenes circumspicit stimulat vos  " Materiámque sibi Ducis indulgentia quaerit"  HEnce vain attempter of the good and great  Be gone from our secure retreat  With all thy dull unwieldy train  That clog and curb the active brain  Which else would like a mettled steed run o'er  Vast Nature's yet unnumber'd store  O'er flowery meads and painted fields  And all the pleasant scenes that beauteous Learning yields  We're doubly arm'd against thy cheats and thee  Thy cheats which only find a place  Among the ignorant and base  By Knowledge and by Majesty  Thou constant guest of every popish cell  Which do'st with Monks and Hermits dwell  Must leave with them this sacred ground  Banish'd from King and court at least for ten miles round  She's gone and now methinks an active fire  Does all my willing veins inspire  My drowsy senses all anew  Are waken'd by his powerful view  The glorious ruler of the morning so  But looks on flowers and straight they grow  And when his beams their light unfold  Ripens the dullest earth and warms it into gold  ODE SUNG BEFORE KING CHARLES II ON NEWYEAR'SDAY  BY MR JACOB ALLESTRY  Son of James Allestry a bookseller of London who was ruined by the great fire of Jacob was educated at Westminster school entered thence at Christ Church in Act Term at the age of and was elected student in He took the degrees in Arts was Music Reader in and Terrae Filius in  "both which offices Wood says he performed with very great applause being then accounted a good philologist and poet But being exceedingly given to the vices of poets his body was so much macerated and spent by juvenile extravagances that he retired to an obscure house in the suburb of Oxon"  where continuing incognito about weeks he died in a miserable condition Oct and was buried very meanly in St Thomas's churchyard at the east end of the chancel N    ARISE great Monarch see the joyful day  Drest in the glories of the East  Presumes to interrupt your sacred rest  Never did night more willingly give way  Or morn more chearfully appear  Big with the mighty tidings of a Newborn Year  Blest be that Sun who in time's fruitful womb  Was to this noble embassy design'd  To head the golden troops of days to come  Nor lagg'd ingloriously behind  Ignobly in the last year's throng to rise and set  In this 'tis happier far than May  Since to add years is greater than to give a day  CHORUS  Oh may the happy days increase  With spoils of war and wealth of peace  Till Time and Age shall swallow'd be  Lost in vast Eternity  May Charles ne'er quit his sacred throne  Himself succeed himself alone  And to lengthen out his time  Take God from us and give to him  That so each world a Charles may know  Father above and son below  Hark the jocund spheres renew  Their chearful and melodious song  While the glad Gods are pleas'd to view  The rich and painted throng  Of happy days in their fair order march along  Move on ye prosperous hours move on  Finish your course so well begun  Let no ill omen dare prophane  Your beauteous and harmonious train  Or jealousies or foolish fears disturb you as you run  See mighty Charles how all the minutes press  Each longing which shall first appear  Since in this renowned year  Not one but feels a secret happinness  As big with new events and some unheard success  See how our troubles vanish see  How the tumultuous tribes agree  Propitious winds bear all our griefs away  And peace clears up the troubled day  Not a wrinkle not a scar  Of faction or dishonest war  But pomps and triumphs deck the noble kalendar  WHAT ART THOU LOVE  BY MR ALLESTRY  WHat art thou Love whence are those charms  That thus thou bear'st an universal rule  For thee the soldier quits his arms  The king turns slave the wise man fool  In vain we chace thee from the field  And with cool thoughts resist thy yoke  Next tide of blood alas we yield  And all those high resolves are broke  Can we e'er hope thou should'st be true  Whom we have found so often base  Cozen'd and cheated still we view  And fawn upon the treacherous face  In vain our nature we accuse  And doat because she says we must  This for a brute were an excuse  Whose very soul and life is lust  To get our likeness what is that  Our likeness is but misery  Why should I toil to propagate  Another thing as vile as I  From hands divine our spirit came  And Gods that made us did inspire  Something more noble in our Frame  Above the dregs of earthly fire  VERSES AND PASTORALS  Mr Allestry had the chief hand as Wood was informed in making the Verses and Pastorals which were spoken in the Theatre of Oxford May by William Savile second son of George earl afterwards marquis of Halifax and George Cholmondeley third son of Robert viscount Cholmondeley of Kellis both of Christ Church before James duke of York his dutchess and the lady Anne N  SPOKEN IN THE THEATRE AT OXFORD  BY LORD SAVILE  By the death of his eldest brother this young nobleman succeeded to his father's title of marquis of Halifax which on his own decease in became extinct N  AND MR CHOLMONDELEY  LORD SAVILE TO THE DUKE OF YORK  GREAT SIR  WHen last your Royal brother blest this place  And all about did his kind beams dispense  A joy divine was seen in every face  Till Faction drove our tutelar angel hence  Heaven knew how far our mortal frame could bear  Mingling our rapture with some fit allay  And that for future bliss we might repair  Wisely reserv'd the blessing of this day  MR CHOLMONDELEY TO THE DUKE  We miss'd a Royal brother by his side  LORD SAVILE TO THE DUTCHESS  We long'd to see those charms which him o'ercame  MR CHOLMONDELEY TO THE LADY ANNE  You Madam was our only joy and pride  Who represented half the Stuart's name  LORD SAVILE TO THE DUKE  Would you then know how much you're welcome here  Think what a joy in Royal breasts did flow  When fatal Glo'ster all our hopes did bear  Which the Gods lost to shew their care of you  When fears and jealousies ran high and loud  And Zeal mistaken blinded wilful eyes  Heaven shook the rod to the rebellious crowd  Threatening to snatch the gem they could not prize  MR CHOLMONDELEY TO THE DUTCHESS  Oxford we hope will not displease your view  Where York first learn'd the rudiments of war  Those early virtues here in blossom grew  Which now in growth and full perfection are  This young gentleman was made cornet of horse in  On king William's accession he was appointed one of the grooms of his bedchamber and served in all the wars during that reign He was constituted major general of queen Anne's forces July and governor of the forts of Tilbury and Gravesand He was continued in his employments and promoted by George I who created him baron of Newborough in Ireland March and baron Newburgh in England July He succeeded his brother as earl of Cholmondeley March and died May N  Though here new towers and buildings daily rise  And arms thrown off we wear the peaceful gown  Our breasts admit no change know no disguise  Prepar'd with pens and swords t' assert the Crown  LORD SAVILE  This is the place to which the sacred names  Of Kings and Heroes annually resound  The triumphs wars and peace of Charles and James  From age to age are with fresh laurels crown'd  MR CHOLMONDELEY  As when a prince's long expected birth  Glads every heart and each Muse tunes her voice  TO THE LADY ANNE  Or when the captive monarchs of the earth  Beg to be slaves and in your chains rejoice  LORD SAVILE  But why in lazy numbers do we bind  Our thoughts which should in active raptures fly  As the coelestial circles unconfin'd  And tun'd to their eternal harmony  Musick's the dialect of happy souls  When sever'd from the earth's unwieldy load  The universal language by both poles  Of the vast distant nations understood  Let instruments and voices both combine  To celebrate the glories of this day  Let art and ecstacy their forces join  And in melodious paths of error stray  Here they sat down and music played which being ended they stood up again and spoke by way of Pastoral  The character of Damon was supported by Lord Savile that of Thyrsis by Mr Cholmondeley N    DAMON  Thyrsis whom the Gods inspire  Glory of our tuneful quire  What auspicious powers dispense  This day's happy influence  See'st thou how the nymphs and swains  Trip it o'er the flowery plains  Deck'd in liveries far more gay  Than could e'er be given by May  Craggy hills their tops advance  Fauns and Satyrs on them dance  To the whistling of the wind  With the birds sweet music join'd  Trees with their unwonted pleasure  Wave their shady tops in measure  THYRSIS  Damon think it nothing strange  You discern so great a change  Since our humble dwelling's blest  With so strange so great a guest  Life and mirth the Gods bestow  And beauty wheresoe'er they go  And if Jove vouchsafe to come  To Philemon's country home  His presence gives it grace divine  And turns the cottage to a shrine  DAMON  Such fine stories poets sing  How their Gods and Jove their king  Envy shepherds' happy days  Pleas'd to hear their welltun'd lays  Quit the blissful seats above  Chusing here on earth to love  Pretty fables proper themes  For poetic airy dreams  But these are joys which men awake  Never must expect to take  THYRSIS  Cease thy doubts thou faithless swain  View but yonder glorious train  Tell me if the skies can show  Such a constellation  DAMON  No  THYRSIS  Should the Deities combine  And in one their glories join  DAMON  Heaven's whole pride too mean would be  To compare with what we see  But pr'ythee shepherd canst declare  What these glorious strangers are  THYRSIS  Damon that's a work too high  For such swains as you and I  'Tis enough our softer lays  Alcon or Lycoris praise  But the princely Daphnis' name  Fills the loudest trump of fame  DAMON  Oft was Daphnis the sublime  Argument of Aegon's  The poetical name by which the earl of Rochaster was distinguished See vol II p N  rhyme  THYRSIS  Daphnis and the Nymph that shares  All his pleasures all his cares  DAMON  While he sung his victories  THYRSIS  And her no less conqu'ring eyes  DAMON  Glad rocks echoed to his voice  THYRSIS  Vales return'd the tuneful noise  DAMON  Savage inmates of the wood  All compos'd and listening stood  THYRSIS  Distant hills their tops did bend  Leaning as they did attend  But since Aegon left the plain  All the under crew in vain  Strive to sing what may appear  Worthy princely Daphnis' ear  DAMON  Fear not Thyrsis there does rest  In great Daphnis' noble breast  Too much goodness to refuse  Tribute from an humble Muse  Did the Gods accept alone  Worthy victims they'd have none  THYRSIS  Then though we cannot entertain  Daphnis in a lofty strain  Nor his great exploits set forth  Or his peerless lady's worth  Such a homely Muse as ours  Can bid them welcome to these bowers  Damon begin to Phyllis I  Thou to Daphnis shalt apply  DAMON  Content  THYRSIS  But stay  DAMON  Why stay  THYRSIS  Mine ear  Heavenly music seems to hear  Phoebus will his quire prevent  And pay the duty which we meant  DAMON  Let's attend while Phoebus sings  And tune our oatpipes to his strings  Musick again which ended  Ah Thyrsis how shall humble swains  As thou and I perform such strains  Can we a fitting present make  For us to give or these to take  THYRSIS  The garland Chloris made I'll bring  When I flung Strephon from the ring  Though Caesar's birthday it should crown  Fresh roses will for that be blown  DAMON  I have a lamb as white as snow  Though half engag'd to Pan by vow  I'll sacrifice it here for he  Pan or some greater God must be  THYRSIS  Why dost thou talk of sacrifice  These seem not angry Deities  Would cruel Sylvia were here  She'd learn to think herself less fair  And in a noble mixture find  Humility with beauty join'd  DAMON  Then may it please the royal Three  T' accept an hearty wish from me  By all true swains be Daphnis fear'd  And no Whig wolves come near his herd  THYRSIS  May each bright nymph look gay and young  Doubling the stook from whence they sprung  BOTH  Then yearly hecatombs we'll pay  If every Spring brings such a May  TO A PERSON OF HONOUR  The honourable Edward Howard by his poem called "The British Princes" engaged the attention of by far the most eminent of his contemporaries who played upon his vanity as the wits of half a century before had done on that of Thomas Coriat by writing extravagant compliments on his work See Butler's verses in the English Poets vol VII p Waller's vol VIII p Denham's vol IX p Sprat's in the same volume p and the Duke of Dorset's vol XI p N  ON HIS INCOMPARABLE POEM  BY MR MATTHEW CLIFFORD  The ingenious writer to whom Dr Spratt addressed his Life of Cowley He was master of the Charterhouse N    WITH envy criticks you'll this poem read  Whose author's wit does more than man exceed  Where all's so good alike no man can say  This may be added or that par'd away  Where all's so new no search can ever trace  The persons mention'd in their time or place  Great soul of nature which dost books defy  And their weak aid in this thy history  Thou art no slave to rule or precedent  Where others imitate thou dost invent  It is we grant all thy invention  The language too intirely is thy own  Thou leav'st as trash below thy great pretence  Grammar to pedants and to plain men sense  But as in this thy matchless poetry  Thou follow'st none so none can follow thee  ON THE SAME  BY THE LORD VAUGHAN  John lord Vaughan grandson to Richard the first earl of Carbery He was made a knight of the Bath at the coronation of Charles II and was for some time governor of Jamaica The latter part of his days were passed in retirement enjoying a fine fortune greatly improved by his own excellent conduct In this interval he built a handsome mansionhouse at Chelsea where he died Jan Anne his only daughter and heir was married in to Charles marquis of Winchester heir apparent to the duke of Bolton who never cohabited with her She died Sept N    WOnder not sir that praises yet ne'er due  To any other are yet heap'd on you  'Twas envy robb'd you of your praise before  Men see their faults and envy now no more  'Tis but your merit nor can justly such  Which gave too little once now give too much  Your "Princes" do all Poetry surpass  As much as Penmainmaur exceeds Parnass  It is so great a prodigy of Wit  That Art and Nature both fall short of it  For leaving Art and left of Nature too  Your Poem has no other Muse than you  ON THE SAME  AS when a bully draws his sword  Though no man gives him a cross word  And all persuasions are in vain  To make him put it up again  Each man draws too and falls upon him  Ev'n so dear Ned thy desperate pen  No less disturbs all witty men  And makes them wonder what a devil  Provokes thee to be so uncivil  When thou and all thy friends must know 'em  Thou yet wilt dare to print thy poem  That poor cur's fate and thine are one  Who has his tail pegg'd in a  bone  About he runs nobody 'll own him  Men boys and dogs are all upon him  And first the greater wits were at thee  Now every little fool will pat thee  Fellows that ne'er were heard or read of  If thou writ'st on will write thy head off  Thus mastiffs only have a knack  To cast the bear upon his back  But when th' unwieldy beast is thrown  Mungrils will serve to keep him down  PROLOGUE SPOKEN AT THE OPENING OF THE DUKE'S NEW PLAYHOUSE IN DORSETGARDEN  'TIS not in this as in the former age  When Wit alone suffic'd t' adorn the stage  When things wellsaid an audience could invite  Without the hope of such a gaudy sight  What with your fathers took would take with you  If Wit had still the charm of being new  Had not enjoyment dull'd your appetite  She in her homely dress would yet delight  Such stately theatres we need not raise  Our Old House would put off our dullest plays  You Gallants know a fresh wench of sixteen  May drive the trade in honest bombazine  And never want good custom should she lie  In a back room two or three stories high  But such a beauty as has long been known  Though not decay'd but to perfection grown  Must if she think to thrive in this lewd town  Wear points lac'd petticoats and a rich gown  Her lodgings too must with her dress agree  Be hung with damask or with tapestry  Have china cabinets and a great glass  To strike respect into an amorous ass  Without the help of stratagems and arts  An old acquaintance cannot touch your hearts  Methinks 'tis hard our authors should submit  So tamely to their predecessors' wit  Since I am sure among you there are few  Would grant your grandfathers had more than you  But hold I in this business may proceed too far  And raise a storm against our theatre  And then what would the wise adventurers say  Who are in a much greater fright today  Than ever poet was about his play  Our apprehensions none can justly blame  Money is dearer much to us than fame  This thought on let our poets justify  The reputation of their poetry  We are resolv'd we will not have to do  With what's between those gentlemen and you  Be kind and let our house have but your praise  You're welcome every day to damn their plays  SONG  AS he lay in the plain his arm under his head  And his flocks feeding by the fond Celadon said  If Love's a sweet passion why does it torment  If a bitter said he whence are Lovers content  Since I suffer with pleasure why should I complain  Or grieve at my fate when I know 'tis in vain  Yet so pleasing the pain is so soft is the dart  That at once it both wounds me and tickles my heart  To myself I sigh often without knowing why  And when absent from Phyllis methinks I could die  But oh what a pleasure still follows my pain  When kind Fortune does help me to see her again  In her eyes the bright stars that foretell what's to come  By soft stealth now and then I examine my doom  I press her hand gently look languishing down  And by passionate silence I make my love known  But oh how I'm blest when so kind she does prove  By some willing mistake to discover her love  When in striving to hide she reveals all her flame  And our eyes tell each other what neither dare name  THE PRISONER IN THE TOWER  TO THE LADY M C  WHILST Europe is alarm'd with wars  And Rome foments the Christian jars  Whilst guilty Britain fears her fate  And would repent her crime too late  Here safe in my confin'd retreat  I see the waves about me beat  And envy none that dare be great  A quiet conscience and a friend  Help me my happy hours to spend  Let Celia to my cell resort  She turns my prison to a court  Instead of guards by day and night  Let Celia still be in my sight  And then they need not fear my flight  Could sense of servile fear prevail  Or could my native honour fail  Her sight would all my doubts control  And give her back my peaceful soul  Such charming truths her words contain  Or if her angel voice refrain  Her eyes can never plead in vain  LOVE BUT ONE  SEE these two little brooks that slowly creep  In snaky writhings through the plains  I knew them once one river swift and deep  Blessing and blest by poets strains  Then touch'd with awe we thought some God did pour  Those floods out of his sacred jarr  Transforming every weed into a flower  And every flower into a star  But since it broke itself and double glides  The naked banks no dress have worn  And you dry barren mountain now derides  These vallies which lost glories mourn  Such Chloris is thy love which while it ran  Confin'd within a single stream  Fir'd every tuneful son of mighty Pan  And thou wert mine and all men's theme  But when imparted to one Lover more  It in two streams did faintly creep  The shepherd's common Muse grew low and poor  And mine as lean as these my sheep  Alas that honour Chloris thou hast lost  Which we to thy full flood did pay  While now that swain that swears he loves thee most  Slakes but his thirst and goes away  SONG ON A LADY INDISPOSED  BY MR BEVIL HIGGONS  An account of this poet has been already printed in vol I p to which the following anecdote may be added  "King Charles II sold Dunkirk to Louis XIV and gave him English oak enough to build the very fleet that afterwards attacked and defeated one of ours in Bantry Bay on the coast of Ireland This puts me in mind of the foresight of a gentleman who had been some time envoy from the king to the princes and states of Italy and who in his return home made the coast of France his road in order to be as useful to his country as possible and to his sovereign too as he thought In his audience of the king he told his majesty that the French were hard at work building men of war in several of their ports and that such a hasty increase of the naval power of France could not but threaten England's sovereignty of the seas and consequently portend destruction to her trade The gentleman was in the right for our trade and the sovereignty of the seas are dependent on each other they must live or die together But what a recompense do you think he met with for his fidelity really such a one as I would hardly have believed had I been told it by any person but his own son the late Mr Bevil Higgons whose works both in prose and verse have made him known to all the men of letters in Britain and whose attachment to the family of Stuart even to his dying day puts his veracity in this point out of dispute The recompence was a severe reprimand from the king as the forerunner to the laying him aside for talking of things which his majesty told him it was not his business to meddle with"  I forget from which of the political writers between and this anecdote was transcribed most probably The Craftsman N    FLAVIA'S eyes like fires suppress'd  More fiercely flame again  Nor can her beauty be decreas'd  Nor alter'd by her pain  Those various charms which round her play  And do her face adorn  Still as they ripen fall away  Fresh beauties still are born  So doth it with the lovers fare  Who do the dame adore  One fit of love kill'd by despair  Another rages more  TO SIR GODFREY KNELLER DRAWING LADY HYDE'S PICTURE  BY MR HIGGONS  THE Cyprian Queen drawn by Apelles' hand  Of perfect beauty did the pattern stand  But then bright nymphs from every part of Greece  Did all contribute to adorn the piece  From each a several charm the painter took  For no one mortal so divine could look  But happier Kneller Fate presents to you  In one that finish'd beauty which he drew  But oh take heed for vast is the design  And madness 'twere for any hand but thine  For mocking thunder bold Salmoneus dies  And 'tis as rash to imitate her eyes  TO A LADY WHO RAFFLING FOR THE KING OF FRANCE'S PICTURE FLUNG THE HIGHEST CHANCES ON THE DICE  BY THE SAME  FORTUNE exerts her utmost power for you  Nor could she more for her own Louis do  She thought some mighty kingdom was the stake  And did his throw for the great monarch make  But as all princes at far distance wooe  First send their image where their heart is due  So now thrice happy nymph would you resort  Where Fate invites you to the Gallic court  That lucky genius which the picture gave  Would make the great original your slave  He like the piece can only be your prize  Who never yields but to the brightest eyes  ON LADY SANDWICH'S  Elizabeth countess of Edward the third earl N  BEING STAYED IN TOWN BY THE IMMODERATE RAIN  BY MR HIGGONS  THE charming Sandwich would from cities fly  While at her feet adoring princes lie  And all her nobler conquests would forego  Less glorious slaves and peasants to subdue  Thus conquering monarchs who have kingdoms won  And all their neighbouring states with arms o'errun  For want of work their armies to employ  Remote and savage provinces destroy  But Heaven in pity weeps while we complain  Or else our tears exhal'd drop down in rain  The darken'd sun does scarce through clouds appear  And tempests rage to keep our wishes here  The floods free passage to her scorn deny  And Nature disobeys her cruelty  But could the waves rise equal to our flame  We'd drown the world to stop the flying dame  TO MR POPE  BY THE SAME  THY wit in vain the feeble critick gnaws  While the hard metal breaks the serpent's jaws  Grieve not my friend that spite and brutal rage  At once thy person and thy Muse engage  Our virtues only from ourselves can flow  Health strength and beauty to blind chance we owe  But Heaven indulgent to thy nobler part  In thy fair mind express'd the nicest art  Nature too busy to regard the whole  Forgets the body to adorn the soul  OF THE IMMORTALITY OF THE MUSES  BY HENRY CROMWELL  Better known as the friend and correspondent of Mr Pope than by any writings of his own It was from a mistress of this gentleman Mrs Thomas or as she was commonly called Corinna that Curll obtained the first Letters of Mr Pope that were exhibited to public view N  ESQ  INSCRIBED TO MR DRYDEN  THY wellknown malice fretful Envy cease  Nor tax the Muse and me  With a weak genius and inglorious ease  WhatI should then whilst youth does vigour yield  Pursue the dusty glories of the field  Our fathers' praise or bend my utmost care  To the dull noise of the litigious bar  No these must diebut the most noble prize  That which alone can man immortalize  Must from the Muses' harmony arise  Homer shall live whilst Tenedos shall stand  Or Ida's top survey the neighbouring strand  Whilst Simois' streams along the valleys glide  And in the sea discharge their rapid tide  Hesiod shall live till corn is not in use  Till the plump grape denies its wealthy juice  The world Callimachus shall ever prize  For what his fancy wants his art supplies  The tragedies of mighty Sophocles  Shall in no age their just applauses miss  So well Aratus of the planets wrote  That sun and moon must fail when he's forgot  When crafty Davus a hard father cheats  To serve the son when easy cully treats  The jilting whore and bawd the figures shew  The Comick from Menander's model drew  Ennius whose Muse by Nature was design'd  Compleat had Art with bounteous Nature join'd  And tragic Accius of style sublime  And weighty words shall stand the shock of Time  Whilst Jason's golden fleece shall have a name  Who shall a stranger be to Varro's fame  Lucretius Nature's causes did rehearse  In such a lofty and commanding verse  As shall remain till that one fatal day  Which must the world itself in ruins lay  Virgil thy Works Divine shall patterns stand  For each succeeding age's copying hand  Whilst Rome shall all its conquer'd world command  Whilst Cupid shall be arm'd with bow and dart  And flaming shafts shall pierce the lover's heart  Shall we O sweet Tibullus love each line  That comes from that soft moving pen of thine  Both East and West resound with Gallus' fame  Gallus and his Lycoris are their theme  Statues and tombs with age consume and die  'Tis verse alone has immortality  To verse must yield the greatest acts of kings  Riches and empire are but empty things  Without the lasting fame a poet brings  Let vulgar spirits trivial blessings choose  May thy Castalian spring inspire my Muse  O God of wit and myrtles wreath my hair  Then the too fearful lover may repair  To what I write to free his breast from care  As living worth detraction still attends  Which after death a juster fame defends  So I shall my last funeral flame survive  And in my better part for ever live  ODE TO SYLVIA  IN IMITATION OF PRIOR  IN flowery flelds in cool retreats  With wounded heart and weeping eyes  I've sought the happy Muses' seats  Since first your beauty did surprize  But oh too late my doom's declar'd  These charming scenes create desire  For every sight inflames the bard  And every breath foments the fire  I who Love's golden darts defy'd  His pointed shafts his piercing bow  An allcommanding force have try'd  Yet sink beneath the mighty woe  Cease dear disturber of my rest  Let some choice remedy be found  Oh may the spear that struck my breast  Assuage the grief and heal the wound  Your charms inthrall your wit confines  Each sprightly swain that views the field  Where your prevailing lustre shines  The fairest nymphs are forc'd to yield  So when the splendid lamp of day  Shoots forth his wideextending fires  Each star contracts his sickly ray  And with a fading pomp retires  THE APPARITION BY ABEL EVANS  Dr Abel Evans the author of this and the following poems though a man of genius the friend of the first poets of the times and applauded by them is now hardly known He is generally styled Dr Evans the Epigrammist and was one of the Oxford wits enumerated in the following distich wretchedly imitated in the "Additions to Pope" vol I p  " Alma novem genuit celebres Rhedycina poetas  " Bub Stubb Cobb Crabb Trapp Young Carey Tickell Evans"  He is likewise mentioned in the Dunciad B II ver in company with Dr Young and Dean Swift as one of the authors whose works had been claimed by James More Smith Dr Evans was of St John the Baptist's College Oxford and took the degree of MA March that of BD April and DD May He was bursar to his college vicar of St Gyles's Oxford and appears to have been intimate with Mr Pope to whom there are two letters by him in print in one of which the initial letter W intended for his Christian name is by mistake put instead of that by which he used to sign himself R  DD OCCASIONED BY THE PUBLICATION OF TINDAL'S RIGHTS OF THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH  " Dii quibus imperium est animarum Umbraeque silentes  " Et Chaos Phlegethon loca nocte silentia late  " Sit mihi fas audita loqui"  VIRG Aen VI  BEGIN my Muse the dire adventure tell  How the supremest gloomy Power of Hell  Convers'd familiar with a mortal Man  Where when and how the conference began  Bring each particular in open sight  And do the Devil and the Doctor right  As round the world that restless spirit flew  This spacious Earth and all her sons to view  To see how Treason Lust and Murder strove  To fill his realms and empty those above  While Truth was trampled on by Lies and Spite  And Wrong victorious triumph'd over Right  Vice domineer'd and haughty swore aloud  Surrounded with a numerous flattering crowd  Virtue with blushes cover'd o'er retir'd  By all forsaken though by all admir'd  Silent she griev'd with pity at the sight  Then wing'd tow'rds Heaven her solitary flight  Not so the Fiend with other passions fraught  Exulting on his mighty conquests thought  Wide to his view the lovely prospect lay  But still with joy malign he ey'd the prey  For some escaping made his madness rise  Louring he scowl'd and darken'd all the skies  Unmindful of the many Satan stood  Revenge against those flying few he vow'd  Then toss'd the vipers round his horrid head  And thus indignant to himself he said  " These kingdoms of the Earth of old were given  If I mistake not in exchange for Heaven  Their power their wealth and glory all are mine  I hold them from above by grant divine  Uxorious Adam by my cunning crost  Forfeit to treason all their tenures lost  Then if I hold by titles such as these  Who shall my tenures dare dispute or seize  Yetfor all thisspite of my sovereign will  Some nations do decline their homage still  The three great quarters of the world are mine  See how their altars smoak and temples shine  In Europe too nor am I less rever'd  Where grateful Rome her images has rear'd  Or where Fanatic Sectaries abound  I scower with pleasure my devouring round  But Albion cursed isle by Priests misled  False to my hopes is in rebellion bred  Not that my emissaries there I want  Atheists to curse and Hypocrites to cant  Burgess  The celebrated Dissenter  aloft harangues the gaping crowd  While witty Garth  The great physician N  below blasphemes aloud  And to each other though so opposite  Yet in my cause both lovingly unite  The Toleration to my wish proceeds  Neglected gardens must be choak'd with weeds  Oh could I sink the Sacramental Test  Down falls at once the Altar and the Priest  For still th' Establish'd Church is all my bane  And while that stands I ne'er must hope to reign  But then that Oxford damn'd pedantic town  Thus to be fool'd by a squarecap and gown  How old and silly Satan art thou grown  But 'tis resolv'd new measures I will try  Quick to AllSouls to Tindal I will fly  Tindal alike with me by GOD accurs'd  In vice and error from his cradle nurs'd  He studies hard and takes extreme delight  In whores or heresies to spend the night  My vassal sworn he loves Confusion's cause  And hates like me all government and laws  All ties of duty gratitude are vain  No bonds his furious malice can restrain  All interests civil sacred still unite  With idle toil to check his ardent spite"  Thus having said quick down to earth he fell  Full in the middle of the Quadrangle  With sudden glance he travers'd all the rooms  And then forthwith a human shape assumes  Like an old Collegebedmaker he bent  His clovenfoot he wriggled as he went  A frowzy highcrown'd hat his face did hide  A hooked staff his tottering steps did guide  A bunch of various keys hung jangling by his side  Quick to the Doctor's chamber he repair'd  Three solemn raps upon the door were heard  The Doctor listening trembled swore and star'd  And in an instant tow'rds the door he goes  The door selfopening took him thwart the nose  Astonish'd back he started with a bound  And thought at least he trod enchanted ground  But as the spectre nearer to him drew  Resolv'd at last he cries "Zounds what are you"  The Spright observing streight his great confusion  Thus calmly silence broke as he who knows one  " Dear Doctor pr'ythee do not tremble so  Pray be compos'd whatnot Crippelia know  The Devil is not come to fetch you now  Once I was young nor wanted female charms  When I lay panting in your curling arms  Lock'd in the folds of Love we both defy'd  The Statutes and the Laws of GOD beside  Then my Civilian as intranc'd you lay  How did you sigh and kiss the hours away  Not Alexander with Statira blest  His passion with more tenderness express'd  What though with age and weakness now I bend  With wrinkles shrivel'dfor one tumbler send  If not a mistress use me like a friend  For favours past some small regards are due  I would not at these years have flouted you  Turn then Barbarian turn thy lovely eyes  Survey me welland mark my thin disguise  No musty collegematron here thou see'st  Them and their masters I alike detest  Abhor as thou dost any Christian priest  Before thee stands Hell's mighty sovereign king  My subjects thanks for thy last works I bring  All my grim sons with emulation fir'd  Restless thy Rights thy Christian Rights requir'd  Thy Christian Church's Rights immortal page  Worthy thy malice impudence and rage  Envious they ask in sullen surly mood  What Incubus did o'er thy fancy brood  All Hell resounds thy name with loud applause  And love the leader as they like the cause  But above all the hotbrain'd Athiest crew  That ever Greece or Rome or Britain knew  Wave all their laurels and their palms to you  Spinoza smiles and criesThe work is done  Tindal shall finish Satan's darling son  Tindal shall finish what Spinoza first begun  Hobbes Milton Blount Vanini with him join  All equally admire the vast design  Thento the trumpet's and the clarion's sound  The giddy goblets whirl in eddies round  To Tindal's healthon earth may Tindal dwell  Late may we have his presence here in Hell  Till he the glorious work has done they cry  Till Christian churches all in ruins lie  Sonorous shoutings rend the livid sky  No single fiend through all the numerous host  Declines the glass when Tindal is the toast  Old Epicurus to Lucretius bow'd  Young witty learn'd vain impudent and proud  Diagoras next Apollonius sate  The solemn sages on thy works debate  The traitor Judas listening grimning stood  Sometimes he mus'd and then he laugh'd aloud  'Twixt rage and hate and scorn at last he cries  Curse on thee for thy silly random kiss  To take the Founder and the Church to miss  Apostate Julian rose and loudly swore  The Galilean's empire was no more  His royal priesthood should for ever cease  And Satan shall regain the realms of bliss"  By this time Tindal quite recover'd stood  His visage redden'd with returning blood  And thus he answer'd when he thrice had bow'd  Dr  "Great are the honours which the Prince of Hell  Bestows upon a mortal Infidel  Nor with less pleasure I the praises hear  Your subjects to my trifling labours spare  Neither to you nor them I must confess  My duty as I ought I can express  Fain would I merit more would they but praise me less  But give me leave as I'm in duty bound  To pay thee Satan reverence most profound  Here with his head nine times he touch'd the ground  Civility surprizing I acknowledge  To visit a poor Fellow of a College  For Hell's dread emperor to condescend  Himself to see a vile terrestrial friend  Tell me ye Gods of Erebus and Night  How have ye heard of such a worthless wight  What thanks are then Supreme Apostate due  From me the meanest of God's foes to you"  S  "Egregious youth thou last best hopes of Hell  All Satan's sons have hitherto done well  But thou all Satan's sons do'st far excel  However let us not my worthy friend  Our time in ceremonies only spend  Nine times three minutes I can only stay  And cannot bear the least approach of day  Then to the business quickly let us come  'Tis what you study here and I at home  The Church of England is the cursed thing  That you and I must to destruction bring"  D  "Thanks great Destroyer if so mean a man  As I but work such mighty mischief can  No time nor cost I'll spare no strength or pains  The Church of England's losses are my gains  Some Deanry then to my layfee shall fall  The Bishopricksmy betters must haveAll"  S  "I tell thee Tindal and observe it well  Merit like thine does all reward excel  For gold or fame let little souls contend  Disinterested mischief be thy end  Only with patience in thy work persist  To Hell's infernal Caesar leave the rest"  D  "Oh Emperor what merit can I claim  The youngest hero in thy lists of fame  Had I of old as Scriptureannals sing  Wag'd war with thee 'gainst Heaven's perpetual King  Had I but only on the conquer'd side  Display'd with thee my vanity and pride  Some laurel then I could with pleasure wear  And without blushing now my praises hear"  S  "Extremes on all sides we with justice blame  A little then thy headstrong rage reclaim  And try thy lust of anarchy to tame  Mischief enough remains on earth undone  Then check thy flight tow'rds Heaven my towering son  The greatest worth still bounds and limits knows  Be satisfy'dand gall thy present foes  The Christian Church is still in safety found  Let that be first quite level'd to the ground  When thou hast finish'd this no small design  Thou may'st with reason for fresh mischief pine  And before all the Christian Churches still  Let Albion's Church employ thy utmost skill  Quick against that thy second battery raise  And equal to thy mischief be thy praise  Her Clergy first with foulest lyes defame  Her Clergy of whatever age or name  Rome's Pontiff and the ruling Elders spare  To blacken Albion's Bishops be thy care  Tell how that realm is by the Bishops curs'd  All discord error by their canons nurs'd  New schemes of government unheardof raise  And all but that which you live under praise  For mad Republics still thy strains pursue  For mad Republics whether old or new  All cursed Monarchies alike decry  Mix'd absolute their various rights deny  Monarchs as Tyrants in thy books display  Bishops as feller Tyrants far than they  False are our hopes and profitless our pains  While Bishops mitres wear and Anna reigns"  D  "It shall be done great Enemy of light  I bear them all with thee an equal spite  An equal spite though not a power I bring  With thee 'gainst Heaven's allruling tyrant King  I hate his Son as much as you or more"  S  "Why wilt thou thus aloft unbounded soar  Stoop stoop thy wings on earth again descend"  D  "At thy monition downwards thus I bend  And only wishHis Church on earth may end  Oh were my will but once Britannia's Law  Rome should again the servile nation awe  The Druids else regain their lost abodes  And Thor and Woden be Britannia's Gods  Idols in every temple should be found  The poor in chains of Superstition bound  The rich in Luxury and Atheism drown'd  All Decency and Order should be damn'd  And wild Enthusiasm run bellowing through the land  All in their turns be Prophets Priests and Kings  Distinctions are but meer fantastic things  All Government does from the people flow  Whom they make Priests or Kings are truly so  These are the doctrines in the Rights I teach  No matter what the Prophets or Apostles preach"  S  "Moses indeed a wonderworking Jew  Tells you how Empire first in Eden grew  That Adam was the first undoubted King  And from his loins all future Monarchs spring  All  egal power on earth with him began  And through his veins to his firstborn it ran  God made the Monarch when he made the Man  The Patriarchs hence their right imperial claim'd  And the first son the successor was nam'd  The People never gave Dominion birth  As well might crowns like mushrooms spring from earth  Notions I own that have been reckon'd good  But wondrous oldI thinkbefore the flood  Dry hard to swallow some of narrower throats  Doubt or deny and think this Rabbi doats  So comment all the text away with notes  Next He of Nazareth the Prophet came  To me and thee  Tindal bad as he was is surely delineated here in terms of exaggeration N  an ever hateful name  The scheme Mosaic he in pieces broke  But gall'd the nations with an equal yoke  Of Monarchs and their crowns he little said  Only To Caesar Caesar's things be paid  The laws of earthly realms he let alone  But in exchange beneath his priests ye groan  And if from Heaven as they pretend he came  Their Priesthood then from Heaven they justly claim  But that a little shocks my faith"  D  "Much mine"  S  "The Christian Priesthood then is not divine  If Jesus then was not the Son of God  Then an impostor"  D  "Which I think"  S  Allow'd"  D  "And justly on the cross th' impostor bow'd  Ye coming ages for th' impostor's sake  Of all his tribe the like examples make  With equal pain and shame his followers vex  With endless plagues that progeny perplex  Let them from earth with utmost fury fly  To seek their weights of glory in the sky  See "The Axe laid to the Root" where you may plainly find such malice and such blasphemy to be the sentiments and language of these execrable apostates EVANS  "  S  "He first then they those slavish doctrines taught  That no revenge must on your foes be wrought  That crowns celestial were to cowards given  And only slaves on earth were lords in heaven  Doctrines too low for thy erected race  Reject them then sublimer far embrace  Submission does thy manly tribe disgrace  Do thou thy native fierceness bravely show  Rather than pardon give the foremost blow  Forgiveness is the coward's want of skill  Or strength to execute his angry will  Or else revenge delayed till time mature  Succeed the vengeance make resentment sure  Thou on thy foes with speed and vigour fly  And every bold offender let him die  Stay not till he thy pardon may implore  Or if he does let that incense thee more  It shews a coward and a coward's blow  Deserves the utmost that thy rage can do  Thy humour be thy law thy lust thy guide  Nor subject be to any thing beside  But obstinacy vanity and pride  In truths like these the hardy Britons train  Thus subjects wise their liberties maintain  And thus Rebellion will securely reign  Subjects like these their trembling rulers awe  Thus Kings receive the People give the law  If any saucy Monarch dare oppose  Or pedant Bishop let them feel their foes  To death or exile quick the traitors drive  No Rebels to the People ought to live  Thus Laud  The great archbishop and his royal master N  and Stuart  The great archbishop and his royal master N  both with justice died  Fierce Cromwell with the many on his side  Thus check'd the Prelate's and the Monarch's pride"  D  "And thus it is True Oracle of Lyes  That in the Rights the Britons I advise  But they remain reluctant to my will  Their beer and beef confirm them blockheads still  Would they but publicly my doctrines own  The Monarchy had long ere this been down  Episcopacy of that name bereft  And that is almost all it now has left  If common fortune does my toils attend  My Second Rights that order quite shall end  Instruct me mighty Leader to

In vain against Religion war you wage  Without the Serpent's cunning with his rage"  D  "Accept my thanks Hades allsapient Sire  Who can enough thy politicks admire  Prostrate I kneel and for thy

AN EPISTLE  TO MR JACOB BOBART  Botany Professor to the University of Oxford and Keeper of the Physic Garden both which offices appear to have been enjoyed by his father who was the first Keeper of the Physic Garden wrote a volume of the "Plantarum Historia universalis Oxoniensis seu Herbarum Distributio nova" and was to have added a third volume on trees but died in The first volume of that work was compiled by Dr Robert Morrison a native of Aberdeen who quitting Scotland in the troubles studied at Paris took a degree in physic at Angers directed the royal gardens at Blois till the death of the duke of Orleans at the Restoration he was appointed overseer of the king's gardens fellow of the College of Physicians and in professor of Botany in the University of Oxford where he read lectures till he set about publishing the "Universal Knowledge of Simples" Wood's Fasti II Edmund Gayton the Poetaster wrote a poem on Mr Jacob Bobart's "Yeomen of the Guards to the Physic Garden to

THANK heaven at last our wars are o'er  We're very wise and very poor  All our campaigns at once are done  We 've ended where we just begun  In perfect peace long may it last  And pay for all the taxes past  Refill th' Exchequer chace our fears  And dry up all the ladies' tears  For husbands sons and lovers lost  In duels some in battles most  Rise rise ye Britons thankful rise  Extol your Empress to the skies  Crown her with laurels ever green  With olives fair inwove between  Her courage drew the conquering sword  Her wisdom banish'd peace restor'd  Long wondrous Anna may'st thou live  T' enjoy those blessings which you give  To guard thy friends confound thy foes  And fix the Church and State's repose  And late for peace to Britain given  Be crown'd with endless peace in Heaven  Farewell ye camps and sieges dire  With all your cannons smoke and fire  Ye victories and trophies vain  A certain loss uncertain gain  Ye squadrons and battalions brave  Who first your foes then friends enslave  Ye gallant leaders who delight  For glory less than gold to fight  Ye public patriots plac'd on high  To sell those votes which first ye buy  And bards whose mercenary lays  Such heroes and such statesmen praise  An honest Muse alike disclaims  Such authors and their impious themes  And with a more becoming grace  Her song impartial does address  Bobart to thee the Muses' friend  Bobart the promis'd song attend  And where no difference appears  Betwixt the subject and the verse  But he who praises and is prais'd  On equal eminence are rais'd  No flatteries thence are to be fear'd  Nor hopes encourag'd of reward  Such is our caseI honour thee  For something thou for something me  Sincerely both our thoughts the same  Of courtiers fortune and of fame  Alike in pity

 Jocund to run his annual course  With nevertiring speed and force  With golden hair the God of day  Wings from the East his fervid way  The stars applauding as he flies  To see him stretch along the skies  To see him roll his fiery race  Athwart the vast aethereal space  Unbind the frosts dissolve the snows  As round the radiant Belt he goes  Mild Zephyrus the Graces leads  To revel o'er the

once deserted by his light  Would languish in eternal night  But Gardening were of all a toil  That on our hopes the least would smile  Should the kind God of day forbear  T' exhale the rains foment

tell us as thou best dost know  Where perfect happiness does grow  What herbs or bodies will sustain  Secure from sickness and from pain  What plants protect us from the rage  Of blighting Time or

Danby  The Physic Garden which lies at the East end of Oxford on the river Cherwell was the donation of Henry Danvers earl of Danby who purchased the ground containing five acres of Magdalen College surrounded it with a wall and erected several beautiful gates at its entrance on the principal of which of the Composite order is the following inscription  "Gloriae Dei optimi Maximi Honori Caroli I Regis in usum Academiae Reipublicae Henricus Comes Danby anno "  The Earl also settled an annual revenue for the maintenance of the Garden and for supplying it with plants and herbs with which it is well stocked Dr Sherrard who was Consul at Smyrna brought from thence a fine collection of exotics built a library here furnished it with botanical books and augmented the professorship The noble founder of the garden was created by king James I baron Danvers of Dantsey and by king Charles I earl of Danby and made a knight of the Bath Dying unmarried Jan the title became extinct but was

reverence wait  Thy wondrous power and justice own  And learn t' assert a tottering throne  Thus Kings that were in empire wise  Rebellions early should chastise  And give their clemency no time

collection of his poems under the title of "The Ramble an Antiheroick Poem together with some Terrestrial Hymns and Carnal Ejaculations by Alexander Radcliffe of Grays Inn Esq " vo inscribed to James Lord Annesley He had published in "Ovid Travestie a Burlesque upon Ovid's Epistles" with a satirical introduction occasioned by the "Preface to a lateBook called The Wits paraphrased" Mr Tonson printed a third edition of this Travestie in The Dedication "To Robert Fairbeard of Grays Inn Esq" is no bad specimen of the author's humour  "Having committed these Epistles to the Press I was horribly put to it for a Patron I thought of some great Lord or some angelic Lady but then again considered I should never be able to adorn my Dedication with benign beams corruscant rays and the Devil and all of influence At last I heard my good friend Mr Fairbeard was come to townnay thenall's well enough To you therefore I offer this English Ovid to whom you may not be unaptly compared in several parcels of your life and conversation only with this exception that you have nothing of his Tristibus 'Tis you who burlesque all the foppery and conceited gravity of the age I remember you once told a grave and affected Advocate 'that he burlesqued God's image for God had made him after his own likeness but he made himself look like an ass' Upon the whole matter I am very well satisfied in my choice of you for a judge if you speak well of the book 'tis all I desire and the bookseller will have reason to rejoice though by your approbation you may draw upon yourself a grand inconvenience for perhaps you may too often have songs sonnets madrigals and an innumerable army of stanzas obtruded upon you by Sir Your humble servant ALEX RADCLIFFE"  Amongst his other poems is a facetious one "On the Memory of Mr John Sprat late Steward of Grays Inn" another "On the Death of Edward Story Esq Master of the Pond and Principal of Bernard's Inn" and "The Sword's Farewell upon the Approach of Michaelmasterm" N    MY masters and friends and good people draw near  For here's a new sight which you must not escape  A stately young fabric that cost very dear  Renown'd for streight

lusty young fellows  No sooner the City had lost their old houses  But they setup this Monument wonderful tall  Though when Christians were burnt as Fox plainly shews us  There was nothing setup but his book in the hall  And yet these men can't  In their conscience but grant  That a House is unworthy compar'd to a Saint  Ah London c  The children of men in erecting old Babel  To be saved from

socker not the candle burns  The little footboy snoars upon the stair  And greasy cookmaid sweats in elbowchair  No coach nor link was heard c  TO THE MEMORY OF A FAIR YOUNG LADY  BY DR YALDEN  Of this writer's life Dr Johnson's elegant little composition supersedes what otherwise might have been said Yalden's "Hymn to Darkness" is  "his best performance"  being  "for the most part imagined with great vigour and expressed with great propriety Of his other poems it is sufficient to say that they deserve perusal though they are not always exactly polished"  I the rather cite this testimony of the great Biographer as the publishers of the English Poets have been censured for admitting Yalden into their collection a censure which if deserved I must take upon myself However it happened that this writer's poems had never been before collected I am persuaded that there are few who have actually read them but must have sound much to admire In the "English Poets" I inserted as many of them as could then be met with Farther researches have discovered what are here printed but there are still four poems which are known to be Dr Yalden's two of which are particularly noticed in Dr Johnson's life of him which have eluded my inquiries "The Conquest of Namur " folio "The Temple of Fame to the Memory of the Duke of Gloucester  " folio "Aesop at Court" and a poem "on the late Queen's accession" I suppose Queen Anne which by the title of it seems not to have been published till after her death N      WHEN black with shades this mourning vault appears  And the relenting marble flows with tears  Think then what griefs a parent's bosom wound  Whose fatal loss enrich'd this hallow'd ground  Strow lilies here and myrtle wreaths prepare  To crown the fading triumphs of the fair  Here blooming youth and charming beauties lie  Till Earth resigns them to their native sky  Like china laid for ages to refine  And make her body like the soul divine  Unmingled may the fragrantdust remain  No common earth the sacred sweets prophane  But let her urn preserve its virgin store  Chaste and unsully'd as she liv'd before  TO MYRA WRITTEN IN HER CLEOPATRA  BY DR YALDEN  HERE lovely Myra you behold  The wonders Beauty wrought of old  In every mournful page appears  The nymph's disdain and lover's tears  Whilst these feign'd tragic tales you view  Fondly you weep and think them true  Lament the hero's slighted flame  Yet praise the fair ungrateful dame  For youths unknown no longer grieve  But rather heal the wounds you give  The slaves your eyes have ruin'd mourn  And pity flames with which your lovers burn  Oh hadst thou liv'd in former days  Thus Fame had sung lov'd Myra's praise  The triumphs of thy haughty reign  Thy matchless form and cold disdain  Thy beauties had remain'd as long  The theme of every poet's song  Then Myra's conquests had been wrote  And Cleopatra died forgot  ADVICE TO A LOVER  BY THE SAME  FOR many unsuccessful years  At Cynthia's feet I lay  Battering them often with my tears  I sigh'd but durst not pray  No prostrate wretch before the shrine  Of some loved Saint above  Ere thought his goddess more divine  Or paid more awful love  Still the disdainful nymph look'd down  With coy insulting pride  Receiv'd my passion with a frown  Or turn'd her head aside  Then Cupid whisper'd in my ear  " Use more prevailing charms  You modest whining fool draw near  And clasp her in your arms  With eager kisses tempt the maid  From Cynthia's feet depart  The lips he briskly must invade  That would possess the heart"  With that I shook off all the slave  My better fortunes tried  When Cynthia in a moment gave  What she for years denied  TO THE EARL OF ROSCOMMON ON HIS ESSAY ON TRANSLATED VERSE  BY DR CHETWOOD  Of

claim for an English barony died at an advanced age Feb N    AS when by labouring stars new kingdoms rise  The mighty mass in rude confusion lies  A court unform'd disorder at the bar  And ev'n in peace the rugged mien of war  Till some wise statesman into method draws  The parts and animates the frame with laws  Such was the case when Chaucer's early toil  Founded the Muses' empire in our soil  Spenser improved it with his painful hand  But lost a noble Muse in Fairyland  Shakspeare said all that Nature could impart  And Jonson added Industry and Art  Cowley and Denham gain'd immortal praise  And some who merit as they wear the bays  Search'd all the treasuries of Greece and Rome  And brought the precious spoils in triumph home  But still our language had some ancient rust  Our flights were often high but seldom just  There wanted one who license could restrain  Make civil laws o'er barbarous usage reign  One worthy in Apollo's chair to sit  To hold the scales and give the stamp of wit  In whom ripe judgement and young fancy meet  And force poetic rage to be discreet  Who grows not nauseous while he strives to please  But marks the shelves in the poetic seas  Who knows and teaches what our clime can bear  And makes the barren ground obey the labourer's care  Few could conceive none the great work could do  'Tis a fresh province and reserv'd for you  Those talents

by Mr Dryden see English Poets vol XIV p and Mr Amherst and Latin verses by Dr Chetwood see Gent Mag for October and Mr C Dryden N    ON THE MARRIAGE OF THE LADY MARY WITH THE PRINCE OF ORANGE  BY DR CHETWOOD  LET fond geographers now seek no more  Their happy ifles near the scorch'd Libyan shore  Nor in th' Atlantic fix those blissful plains  Where too much sun and Spanish avarice reigns  These are the climates favoured by Fate  The happy soils the Islands Fortunate  Their sea from Europe's tumults them divides  And joins them to 't in every thing besides  Peace with her train hath here her palace chose  Riches and pleasure learning and repose  Here Charles like Jove on his Olympus stands  Balancing empires in his mighty hands  And over kings by peaceful arts does find  The best command the empire of the mind  Here gallant Orange tir'd with warlike sweat  Lays down his helmet and seeks soft retreat  Rides o'er the peaceful plains views rural toil  Sees no slain ploughman here manure the soil  For noisy camps he hears soft music's charms  His doubtful sleep not broke by short alarms  The hero thus secure love does surprize  Lying in ambush in the Princess' eyes  Love the frail part in souls the most divine  Whom cautious nature when she does design  Impregnable on every part beside  Like engineers leaves this unfortify'd  On his free soul it does so fast advance  That it's more dreadful than the power of France  Yet to his enemy he scorns to yield  Like Diomede would meet him in the field  But fight not Prince against the Powers divine  Nor at the golden happy shafts repine  For ten days siege a maiden Helen's thine  For Charles the good and the illustrious James  Observe their souls burning with mutual flames  Souls which a real sympathy do prove  Souls unison answering each other's love  Then to him thus they spake  " Brave Prince whose virtues leave thy years behind  And merits fortune greater yet design'd  By Heaven whose youth such high exploits did grace  As prov'd thee of triumphant Nassau's race  Nor sham'st our royal blood that 's in thy veins  Reap here the harvest of your glorious pains  As your reward we to you do resign  Our eldest comfort to be henceforth thine  And know that great Elizabeth when she  From Spanish yoke did set your country free  Gave you not half so much"  Now painful Hollanders you who extend  Your voyages unto the Ocean's end  Whose inexhausted treasuries do hold  The Eastern spices and the Western gold  Speak if you ever such a cargo brought  Ever receiv'd a fleet so richly fraught  As this which brings your Princess to your shore  Confess your Bank compar'd with this is poor  Ev'n we so rich should so much beauty fear  T' export but that she leaves her sister here  Make a continual day with joyous flames  Join with your fleets your Texel to our Thames  With more pomp to receive this gift of Fate  The fair Palladium of your tottering state  And you great Princess fear not the rough main  He knows his duty to his Sovereign  His Nereids will all be of your train  So Venus when she does to Paphos ride  In her smooth shell and cuts the gentle tide  Her nymphs make a long row of goodly pride  Now Flanders more belov'd by Mars than Thrace  Shall at your sight resume her ancient face  The restor'd shepherds shall pipe forth your praise  Call you their Pales in their rural lays  The fearless ploughmen shall you loudly sing  And as to Ceres their fruitofferings bring  The peaceful seas shall break their digues  The French word for  dikes  N  no more  With humble reverence but salute the shore  When you as Halcyons breed all storms shall cease  Europe enjoy an universal peace  ON THE FIRST FIT OF THE GOUT  WElcome thou friendly earnest of fourscore  Promise of wealth that hast alone the power  T' attend the rich unenvy'd by the poor  Thou that dost Aesculapius deride  And o'er his gallypots in triumph ride  Thou that art us'd t' attend the royal throne  And underprop the head that bears the crown  Thou that dost oft in privy council wait  And guard from drowzy sleep the eyes of state  Thou that upon the bench art mounted high  And warn'st the judges how they tread awry  Thou that dost oft from pamper'd prelate's toe  Emphatically urge the pains below  Thou that art ever half the city's grace  And add'st to solemn noddles solemn pace  Thou that art us'd to sit on ladies knee  To feed on jellies and to drink cold tea  Thou that art ne'er from velvet slipper free  Whence comes this unsought honour unto me  Whence does this mighty condescension flow  To visit my poor tabernacle O  As Jove vouchsaf'd on Ida's top 'tis said  At poor Philemon's cot to take a bed  Pleas'd with the poor but hospitable feast  Jove bid him ask and granted his request  So do thou grant for thou 'rt of race divine  Begot on Venus by the God of Wine  My humble suitAnd either give me store  To entertain thee or ne'er see me more  This humourous poem is probably Dr Chetwood's See the following Epistle of Dr Waldren N    TO DR CHETWOOD WHEN HE HAD THE GOUT  BY DR WALDREN  Descended from an antient family and born at Exeter where he received the early part of his education He was admitted a scholar of Exeter College Oxford and afterwards removed to All Souls where he applied to the study of physic which he afterwards practised with good reputation at Exeter On the death of Dr LeopolWilliam Finch warden of All Souls College he was invited in to succeed to that headship but contracted such an indisposition by the journey as occasioned his death in a few days He was buried in the outward chapel belonging to that society Jacob says  "he was a wellbred genteel man most agreeable in conversation very polite in his compositions and peculiarly happy in the expressiion of his thoughts The Westcountry gentlemen mention him with very great esteem and his name and character are very much respected in the University"  N    'TIS no hard matter to divine  How I who love a wench and wine  And all the studied luxuries  That Lamb  Author of a famous Book of Cookery  or Locket  The master of a celebrated eatinghouse or tavern See King's "Art of Cookery" ver N  can devise  Should have the gout and penance do  With foot on chair in velvet shoe  But how a man predicamental  ly sober and near transcendental  That ne'er was known to be a glutton  Beyond a penny chop of mutton  And can't tell what sixth sense or whore is  And Goody is his only Chloris  How such a one should have intestine  Saline and acid so infesting  Is strange to me and as obscure  A riddle almost as the cure  The learned Sydenham does not doubt  But profound thought will bring the gout  And that with bum on couch we lie  Because our reason 's soar'd too high  As cannons when they mount vast pitches  Are tumbled back upon their breaches  Indeed I 'm apt to think in you  Th' hypothesis is very true  For your investigating skull  So  and  full  That hunting things through commonplaces  Y' are lost in  entelechian  mazes  And as when to an house we come  To know if any one 's at home  We knock so one must kick your shin  Ere he can find your soul 's within  Your brains if any sure would work well  Upon the quadrature o' th' circle  But if you 'll have your foot no more in  Flannel you must leave off your poring  Be blithe and merry still as a grig  Mirth is the best Antipodágrig  The gout's enrag'd by care and sadness  The best cure for 't is the oil of gladness  EPISTLE FROM DR WALDREN TO DR CHETWOOD ON HIS REFUSING TO TAKE THE OATHS  MOST PROFOUND  SINCE at a tavern I can't meet you  In paper embassy I greet you  T' advise you not to be so wary  Touching King William and Queen Mary  That spight of fellowship and pupils  You 'll weigh your conscience out in scruples  If as ye Queen'smen must believe  Two  negs  make one affirmative  Why i'th name o' th' predicaments  And all your analytic sense  Will you deny two affirmations  In their turn too to make negations  This  postulatum  any pate  Will grant that 's unprejudicate  Nay th' argument I will assure you  To some appears  à fortiori  Hoc dato et concesso  thus I  In  baralypton  blunderbuss ye  He that to two kings takes an oath  Is by the last absolv'd from both  For each oath being an affirmation  Both as was own'd make a negation  Thus scientifically you see  The more you 're bound the more you 're free  As jugglers when they knit one more  Undo the knot they ty'd before  I admire that your Smiglecian under  standing should make so strange a blunder  As roundly to aver subjection  Were n't couzengerman to protection  Nay more they 're relatives unless ye  Mistake Tom Hobbes  secundum esse    But I'm in hope you 've slily taken  The oath elsewhere to save your bacon  As spark by countryclap half undone  Takes coach and steals a cure at London  TO CELIA  BY DR WALDREN  FIE Celia 'tis silly to sigh thus in vain  'Tis silly to pity a lover you 've slain  If still you continue your slaves to deride  The pity you feign will be taken for pride  And sorrow for sin can never be true  In one who loves daily to act it anew  For if whilst you 're fair you resolve to be coy  You may hourly repent and hourly destroy  Yet none will believe you protest what you will  That you grieve for the dead if the living you kill  Where then are our hopes when we zealously woo  If you vow to abhor what you constantly do  Then Celia be kinder and tell me my fate  For the worst I can suffer 's to die by your hate  If this you design ne'er fancy in vain  By your sighs and your tears to recall me again  Nor weep at my grave for I swear if you do  As you now laugh at me I'll then laugh at you  AN ESSAY UPON DEATH  BY DR WALDREN  TELL me some kind spirit tell  How came Death so terrible  Thou who 'rt already fled in triumph say  Why the embody'd soul is so in love with clay  By what strange magnetism woo'd  She so adheres to flesh and blood  That Fate must force her from her dark abode  Or she would groveling lie  Th' eternal tenant of mortality  The wretch whom a malignant fever fires  Who at each pore in liquid flames expires  Cold Death's refreshing hands to shun  Does to th' unkinder Doctor run  For juleps blisters and phlebotomy  The fever's vanquish'd and the man is free  Yet all this torment only gains  The privilege of being rack'd again with these  Or the severer pains  Of some more merciless disease  Had not the patient better sought a silent tomb  Th' assistance which distempers give but where they never come  Old age which one would guess  Should with a kind of lust  Lie down and sleep in dust  Does yet the grand fatigue of life caress  And gapes for its last dregs with inextinguishable thirst  When the gay fire of the dull eye is lost  Like cooling metals fix'd by winter's frost  When the bald head depopulate and bare  Looks smooth as a white globe of ice  Depriv'd of its onceflourishing spring the hair  All that remains will not suffice  The mighty sum to count  To which the numerous years that have gone o'er amount  Yet ev'n this feeble piece  Now but the monument of what he was  Does with his cordials and elixirs treat  To make his weary pulses beat  With momentary heat  Still he abhors the dismal thought of Death  Still on his guard he stands  Would fain defend his faultering breath  Against the conqueror's stroke with crutches in his hands  Strange riddle of a mystical desire  That man should wish his vital fire  Might vestal prove and ne'er expire  That he should hope that his eclipsed beams  Like Arethusa under ground might stray  And never disembogue their shining streams  Into the glorious ocean of inexhausted day  Is this the cause we so much boast  Our reason as a sure unerring guide  No less our safety than our pride  And would it have us in a tempest ride  In which we are for ever lost  When one kind shipwreck would convey us safe  Back to our native coast  A coast where we may pleasures taste  High with the gust of perils past  Where a perpetual spring of bliss  Blooming in all the rich luxuriances  Of neverfading extasies  Satiates but does not cloy  The ravish'd mind  Where no tears fall but those of joy  Which Niluslike when they o'erflow are kind  But though with all this pomp of words we prate  And paint our happy future state  Yet sure we think them pageantries of a distemper'd head  Which Fancy's pencil did delineate  The broken visions of the living when they dream they 're dead  That we 're so loth to die  Proceeds from Infidelity  For whatsoe'er the sturdy men of sense  Those sculls of Axiom and Philosophy  By Reason's telescope pretend t' evince  Beyond this world there can no other be  Worse than this life when it appears  In all its hurricanes of hopes and fears  So some baulk'd gamester that has only one poor stake  And knows not when he shall get more to keep in play  Does his last chance with trembling take  And would the fatal throw delay  The box once cast to him for ever 's cast away  Or if we 're truly satisfy'd  The soul is to Divinity ally'd  That its impenetrable hypostasis  Is of a lasting and substantial make  Which Death's arrest can never shake  But sprinkled ashes shall arise  Kindled with an exalted energy  If this our firm persuasion be  Doubtless 'tis guilt which makes us groan  When Fate sends forth the black decree  Of dissolution  As a debauch'd gallant  Who 's just embarking for a foreign land  Amidst a rout of creditors does trembling stand  Who for quick payment with wild fury rant  Th' unhappy wretch can't find a bail  And thus his journey 's finish'd in a gaol  So Conscience ralliesup  Of crimes the worst of debts ten thousand bills  Embitters with new poison Death's ungrateful cup  And the departing soul with horror fills  Thus wretched mortals lie  Under a bad necessity  Of strong desire to live and stronger fear to die  Which way soe'er they turn  A forcible dilemma's horn  Wounds them in each hypothesis  The Atheist would for ever live in this  If there 's no other world the Theist if there is  SONG MADE FOR A WEDDING  BY DR WALDREN  LET Hymen on this happy day  The brightest which e'er grac'd the year  Transport in every face display  Since Heaven and Marriage come so near  A matchless pair before him bows  To ask his seals which ever bind  He cannot but approve the vows  Of two so beauteous two so kind  The Godhead smiles then then we know  What the effects of marriage prove  That joys in endless rounds shall flow  And life be one long scene of love  EPIGRAM ON A PIGMY'S DEATH  BY DR SPRAT NOT IN HIS WORKS  BESTRIDE an ant a pigmy great and tall  Was thrown alas and got a deadly fall  Under th' unruly beast's proud feet he lies  All torn but yet with generous ardour cries  " Behold base envious world now now laugh on  For thus I fall and thus fell Phaeton"  MARVEL'S GHOST  BY CAPTAIN JOHN AYLOFFE  This gentleman who was educated at Trinity College Cambridge was a man of wit and humour which carried his inclinations to poetry He published Jacob says several valuable small pieces among which "Marvel's Ghost" is very much admired In the third volume of "Dryden's Miscellanies" is a poem "On the Death of K Charles II and the Accession of K James II to the Throne" by Mr  William  Ayloffe which is tolerably harmonious but too fulsomely flattering to deserve preservation N    FROM the dark Stygian lake I come  To acquaint poor England with her doom  Which by the Infernal Sisters late  I copied from the book of Fate  And though the sense may seem disguis'd  'Tis in these following lines compriz'd  " When England shall forsake the Broom  And take the Thistle in the room  A wanton fiddler shall be led  By fate to shame his master's bed  From whence a spurious race shall grow  Design'd for Britain's overthrow  These whilst they do possess her throne  Shall serve all interests but their own  And shall be both in peace and war  Scourges unto themselves and her  A brace of exil'd youths whose fates  Shall pull down vengeance on those states  That harbour'd them abroad must come  Well skill'd in foreign vices home  And shall their dark designs to hide  With two contesting Churches side  Till with cross persecuting zeal  They have destroy'd the Commonweal  Then incest murder perjury  Shall fashionable virtues be  And villainies infest this isle  Shall make the son of Claudius smile  No oaths or sacraments hold good  But what are seal'd with lust and blood  Lust which cold exile could not tame  Nor plague nor fire at home reclaim  For this she shall in ashes mourn  From Europe's envy turn her scorn  And curse the day that e'er gave birth  To Cecil or to Monk on earth"  But as I onwards strove to look  The angry Sister shut the book  And said "No more that fickle State  Shall know no further of her fate  Her future fortunes must be hid  Till her known ills be remedied  And she to those resentments come  That drove the Tarquins out of Rome  Or such as did in fury turn  Th' Assyrian's palace to his urn"  ON THE CAMBRIDGE COMMENCEMENT  BY CAPTAIN AYLOFFE  HE that first said it knew the worth of wit  Lov'd well his glass and as he drank he writ  Vast was his soul and sparkling was the wine  Which strangely did inspire each mighty line  The watery springs of Helicon are themes  Fit for dull freshmen and dull doctors dreams  Not flood of Cam or well of Aristotle  Yield half the pleasure of the charming bottle  Poor scribblers then that bread and water use  The slender diet of a Bridewell Muse  As easily may Water Poets make  As Coffee Politicians does create  The two grand Whigs of Poetry and State  When booths on Thames were built and oxen roasted  Poets the strength of Waters might have boasted  And might have made their frozen verse to pass  As well as he that putout Ice for Glass  Though our good Proctor otherwise does think  Our Mother Cambridge kindly bids us drink  She holds the candle and the sacred cup  And as one wasteth cries "Drink t' other up"  'Twas drinking got our ancestors renown  And claret first that dyed the scarlet gown  As well may Dutchmen without brandy fight  As English Poets without Claret write  Not moderate learning nor immoderate fees  Are of themselves sufficient for degrees  Wine and the supper must the act compleat  And he does best dispute who best does treat  'Tis Carnival and we'll the time enjoy  This day and next while wine and wit run high  And in the forty days  Preachers in vain may bid the Court repent  But Poets sure did never write in Lent  Now in the name of dulness and smallbeer  Ye Northern Wits of fam'd St John's appear  That scarce taste wine or wit throughout the year  Had she who by the powerful charms of wine  Transform'd Ulysses men to gruntling swine  Had she and you th' experiment tried again  By contrary effects ye had Poets been  Next the pert fops by title dignified  Wise to themselves and fools to all beside  Whom company nor drinking can refine  Blockish and dull beyond the power of wine  Who after the first bottle still the same  Can never higher rise than Anagram  Or at most quibble on their Dowdy's name  When Whig religious Trimmer loyal turns  When Cambridge wives and Barnwell whores turn nuns  When curate 's rich and the fat doctor's poor  When scholars tick and townsmen cheat no more  When amorous fops leave hunting handsome faces  When craving beadle begs no more for places  Hopkins and Sternhold with their paltry rhymes  Shall please us now and take with future times  And waterdrinkers then shall famous grow  Settle the Poet to my Lordmayor's show  Shall Dryden Cowley and our Duke outgo  WRITTEN IN A LADY'S WALLER  THE lovely owner of this book  Does here on her own image look  Each happy page each finish'd line  Does with her matchless graces shine  And is with common verse compar'd  What she is among Beauty's herd  The Poet boasts a lofty thought  In softest numbers smoothly wrought  Has all that pleases the severe  And all that charms a listening ear  And such the nymph isblest with all  That we can sweet or noble call  For never sure was any mind  Of all that from Heaven's treasury came  Of better make and more refin'd  Or lodg'd within a fairer frame  Such angels seem when pleas'd to wear  Some lovely dress of colour'd air  Oh had she liv'd before the old  Bard had so many winters told  Then when his youthful veins ran high  Enflam'd with Love and Poetry  He only to this shining maid  The tribute of his verse had paid  No meaner face no lesser name  Had fix'd his eyes or fed his flame  Her beauties had employ'd his tongue  And Sacharissa died unsung  SONG  YOU say you love repeat again  Repeat th' amazing sound  Repeat the ease of all my pain  The cure of every wound  What you to thousands have deny'd  To me you freely give  Whilst I in humble silence dy'd  Your mercy bid me live  So on cold Latmos' top each night  Endymion sighing lay  Gaz'd on the Moon's transcendent light  Despair'd and durst not pray  But divine Cynthia saw his grief  Th' effect of conquering charms  Unask'd the Goddess brings relief  And falls into his arms  ANACREON IMITATED  OFT

madness of party which could exalt an obscure individual possessed of but moderate talents to an height of popularity that the present times behold with wonder and astonishment He was the son of Joshua Sacheverell of Marlborough clerk who died minister of St Peter's Church in Marlborough leaving a numerous family in very low circumstances Henry was put to school at Marlborough at the charge of Mr Edward Hearst an apothecary who being his godfather adopted him as his son Hearst's widow put him afterwards to Magdalen College Oxford where he became demy in at the age of Young Sacheverell soon distinguished himself by a regular observation of the duties of the house by his compositions goodmanners and genteel behaviour qualifications which recommended him to that society of which he was fellow and as public tutor had the care of the education of most of the young gentlemen of quality and fortune that were admitted of the college In this station he bred a great many persons eminent for their learning and abilities and among  others was tutor to Mr Holdsworth whose "Muscipula" and "Dissertations on Virgil" have been so deservedly esteemed He was contemporaty and chamberfellow with Mr Addison and one of his chief intimates till the time of his famous trial Mr Addison's "Account of the greatest English Poets" dated April in a Farewellpoem to the Muses on his intending to enter into holy orders was inscribed "to Mr Henry Sacheverell" his  then  dearest friend and colleague Much has been said by Sacheverell's enemies of his ingratitude to his relations and of his turbulent behaviour at Oxford but these appear to have been groundless calumnies circulated only by the spirit of party In his younger years he wrote some excellent Latin poems besides several in the second and third volumes of the "Musae Anglicanae" ascribed to his pupils there is a good one of some length in the second volume under his own name transcribed from the Oxford Collection on Q Mary's death He took the degree of MA May BD Feb DD July His first preferment was Cannock in the county of Stafford He was appointed preacher of St Saviour's Southwark in and while in this station preached his famous sermons at Derby Aug and at St Paul's Nov in the same year and in one of them was supposed to point at lord Godolphin under the name of  Volpone  It has been suggested that to this circumstance as much as to the doctrines contained in his sermons he was indebted for his prosecution and eventually for his preferment Being impeached by the house of commons his trial began Feb and continued until the d of March when he was sentenced to a suspension from preaching for three years and his two sermons ordered to be burnt This ridiculous prosecution overthrew the ministry and laid the foundation of his fortune To Sir Simon Harcourt who was counsel for him he presented a silver bason gilt with an elegant inscription He very soon after was collated to a living near Shrewsbury and in the same month that his suspension ended had the valuable rectory of St Andrew Holborn given him by the Queen At that time his reputation was so high that he was enabled to sell the first sermon preached after his sentence expired for the sum of l and upwards of copies it is said were soon fold We find by Swift's Journal to Stella Jan that he had also interest enough with the ministry to provide very amply for one of his brothers yet as the Dean had said before Aug  "they hated and affected to despise him"  In he prefixed a dedication to "Fifteen Discourses occasionally delivered before the University of Oxford by W Adams MA late student of Christ Church and rector of Staunton upon Wye in Oxfordshire" After this publication we hear little of him except by quarrels with his parishioners although he was much suspected to be concerned in Atterbury's plot A considerable estate at Callow in Derbyshire was left to him by his kinsman Geo Sacheverell esq He died June and by his will bequeathed to Bishop Atterbury then in exile who was supposed to have penned his defence for him the sum of l By a letter to him from his uncle it appears that he had a brother named Thomas and a sister Susannah The dutchess of Marlborough describes him as  "an ignorant impudent incendiary a man who was the scorn even of those who made use of him as a tool"  Account c p And Bp Burnet says  "He was a bold insolent man with a very small measure of religion virtue learning or good sense but he resolved to force himself into popularity and preferment by the most petulant railings at Dissenters and Lowchurch men in several sermons and libels wrote without either chasteness of style or liveliness of expression"  History vol II p N    DEDICATED TO MR DRYDEN  FIRST let thy altars smoke with sacred fire  Thy early labours the just Gods require  Let Ceres' blessings usherin the year  To give an omen to thy future care  With sacrifice adorn her grassy shrine  With milk with honey and with flowing wine  Then go the mighty Goddess to adore  When Spring buds forth and Winter is no more  Then wellfed lambs thy plenteous tables load  And mellow wines give appetite to food  Whilst the cool shade by small refreshing streams  Invite soft sleep and gentle pleasing dreams  The rustic youth the Goddess should implore  To bless their fruits and to increase their store  Thrice let the sacrifice in triumph led  Crown the new offspring of her fruitful bed  A joyful choir shall sing her praises round  And with unequal motions beat the ground  Whilst oaken branches on their temples twine  To shew the better use of corn and wine  The Goddess thus appeas'd will bend her ear  And with a plenteous harvest will reward your care  The certain seasons of the year to know  Great Jove has taught us and from whence they flow  Droughts rains and winds their certain signs forego  Those messengers of Fate provide the way  To give the signal of a gloomy day  The moon her tokens constantly fulfils  And with her beams points out th' approaching ills  Her waning orb puts on a various form  To give the sign of an impending storm  When Southwinds rise the herdsmen justly fear  And seek a shelter when the tempest 's near  First from a gentle blast the winds arise  Whose infant voice in whispering murmurs flies  Then with loud clamours fills the troubled skies  By small degrees advanc'd it stronger grows  Till every point each other does oppose  Then through the jarring zones it frets and roars  And lifts the swelling billows to the shores  Vast watery mountains roll upon the sand  And angry surges beat the trembling land  A harsh shrill noise the echoing caverns fills  And strikes the ear from the resounding hills  Whose reverend tops with aged pinetrees crown'd  Rock with the wind and tremble with the sound  The threatening surges hardly can forbear  The tatter'd vessel while the seamen fear  Each rolling billow should their last appear  The frighten'd native of the troubled waves  His longaccustom'd habitation leaves  Now born aloft a winged army soar  To seck for safety on a calmer shore  The moorhen conscious of the tempest near  Plays on the sand and so prevents her fear  The hern forsakes his ancient marshy bed  And towers to heaven while clouds bedew his head  Sometimes he 's met by a descending star  Which warns the tempest rushing from afar  The headlong planet glides in fiery streams  And shoots through darkness with its radiant beams  It cuts the shadows with a train of light  And makes a medley of the day and night  A sportive whirlwind lifts the moving sand  In mystic circles dancing on the land  Now wanton feathers whiten all the flood  And sapless leaves fly o'er the shaken wood  At distance blackening in a dusky cloud  But when a newfledg'd storm comes blustering forth  And quits the thundering regions of the North  When East and West in distant poles conspire  Uniting rage to swell the deluge higher  With rapid streams the fullcharg'd channels flow  Collecting forces as they farther go  Th' unruly tide no sturdy banks control  O'er unknown plains the furious torrents roll  The reapers mourn to see the deluge bear  The longexpected labours of the year  SONG  BY SIR JOHN EATON  TELL me not I my time misspend  'Tis time lost to reprove me  Pursue thou thine I have my end  So Chloris only love me  Tell me not other flocks are full  Mine poor let them despise me  Who more abound with milk and wool  So Chloris only prize me  Tire other easier ears with these  Unappurtaining stories  He never felt the world's disease  Who car'd not for its glories  For pity thou that wiser art  Whose thoughts lie wide of mine  Let me alone with my own heart  And I'll ne'er envy thine  Nor blame him whoe'er blames my wit  That seeks no higher prize  Than in unenvy'd shades to sit  And sing of Chloris' eyes  SIR JOHN EATON IMITATED  BY JOHN EARL OF ROCHESTER  The poems of this witty but profligate nobleman were very judiciously pruned by Dr Johnson before their admission into the tenth volume of the English Poets The Song here preserved however is sufficiently exempt from the censure too many of this writer's poems have deserved In the "Supplement to Swift" I have had occasion to observe from Mr Granger that Rochester had natural modesty The fact is he wrote but little of the ribaldry which passes under his name but having obtained the character of a lewd writer every thing in that strain was fathered upon him  "In all his works"  Dr Johnson says  "there is sprightliness and vigour and every where may be found tokens of a mind which study might have carried to excellence"  N    TOO late alas I must confess  You need not arts to move me  Such charms by nature you possess  'Twere madness not to love ye  Then spare a heart you may surprize  And give my tongue the glory  To boast though my unfaithful eyes  Betray a kinder story  THE PASSINGBELL  COME honest sexton take thy spade  And let my grave be quickly made  Thou still art ready for the dead  Like a kind host to make my bed  I now am come to be thy guest  Let me in some dark lodging rest  For I am weary full of pain  And of my pilgrimage complain  On Heaven's decree I waiting lie  And all my wishes are to die  Hark I hear my passingbell  Farewell my loving friends farewell  Make my cold bed good sexton deep  That my poor bones may safely sleep  Until that sad and joyful day  When from above a voice shall say  " Wake all ye Dead lift up your eyes  " The great Creator bids you rise"  Then do I hope among the just  To shake off this polluted dust  And with new robes of glory drest  To have access among the blest  Hark I hear my passingbell  Farewell my loving friends farewell  BALLAD ON A NEW OPERA  "The Cruelty of the Spaniards in Peru expressed by instrumental and vocal Musick and by art of Perspective in Scenes c Represented daily at The Cockpit in Drury Lane at three afternoon punctually " This Opera may safely be ascribed to Sir William Davenant It was first acted at the time and place and in the manner before described and afterwards introduced by the author into "The Playhouse to be let" See a list of his dramatic writings in the new edition of Dodsley's Old Plays vol VIII N      NOW Heaven preserve our realm  And him that sits at th' helm  I will tell you of a new story  Of Sir William and his apes  With full many merry japes  Much after the rate of John Dorie  This sight is to be seen  Near the street that's call'd the Queen  And the people have call'd it the Opera  But the devil take my wife  If all the days in my life  I did ever see such a foppery  Where first one begins  With a trip and a cringe  And a face set in starch to accost 'em  I  Used by Shakspeare and other ancient writers for  Aye  N  and with a speech to boot  That had neither head nor foot  Might have serv'd for a Charterhouse  rostrum  Oh he look'd so like a Jew  Would have made a man spew  When he told them here was this here was that  Just like him that shews the tombs  For when the sum total comes  'Tis two hours of I know not what  Neither must I here forget  The music how it was set  Dise two ayers and a half and a Jove  To explain this the music should be seen and heard N    All the rest was such a gig  Like the squeaking of a pig  Or cats when they 're making their love  The next thing was the scene  And that as it was lain  But no man knows where in Peru  With a story for the nonce  Of raw head and bloody bones  But the devil a word that was true  There might you have seen an ape  With his fellow for to gape  Now dancing and turning o'er and o'er  What cannot poets do  They can find out in Peru  Things no man ever saw before  Then presently the Spaniard  Struts with his winyard  Now heaven of thy mercy how grim  Who'd have thought that Christian men  Would have eat up children  Had he not seen them do it limb by limb  Oh greater cruelty yet  Like a pig upon a spit  Here lies one there another boil'd to a jelly  Just so the people stare  At an ox in the fair  Roasted whole with a pudding in 's belly  I durst have laid my head  That the king there had been dead  When I saw how they basted and carv'd him  Had he not come up again  Upon the stage there to complain  How scurvily the rogues had serv'd him  A little further in  Hung a third by the chin  And a fourth cut out all in quarters  Oh that Fox had now been living  They had been sure of Heaven  Or at the least been some of his Martyrs  But which was strange again  The Indians that they had slain  Came dancing all in a troop  But oh give me the last  For as often as he pass'd  He still tumbled like a dog in a hoop  And now my Signior Strugge  Perhaps the baboon introduced in this opera R    In good faith you may go jogge  For Sir William will have something to brag on  Oh the English boys are come  With their fife and their drum  And still the Knight must conquer the Dragon  And so now my story is done  And I'll end as I begun  With a word and I care not who know it  Heaven keep us great and small  And bless us some and all  From every such pitiful Poet  THE HYPOCRITE BY MR CARYLL  Of whom see vol II p N  ON THE LORD SHAFTESBURY    THOU 'rt more inconstant than the wind or sea  Or that still veering sex outdone by thee  Reeling from vice to vice thou hast run through  Legions of sins more than the casuists know  Of whom thy friends were wont to say "Poor devil  At least he was not constant to his evil"  Dealing so long in sins of pomp and glory  Who would have thought to make up Guzman's story  Hypocrisy at last should enter in  And fix this floating mercury of sin  All his old sins like misses out of date  Turn pensioners to this new miss of state  His actions look and garb take a new frame  And wear the livery of this sullen dame  Plain band and hair and cloaths disguise the man  All but his dealing and his heart is plain  Not Ovid's stories nor the wife of Lot  Can boast a change beyond our statebigot  All on the sudden in one fatal morn  Our courtier did to a stark Quaker turn  Some think  He does as criminals who would defeat  The course of Justice madness counterfeit  No Godliness that once muchpitied thing  Of his new fiddle is the only string  For the poor Church is all his tender care  And Popery's growth he sounds in every ear  At which the dirty rout run grunting in  As when the old wife's kettle rings the swine  So the courtdame who in her youthful pride  No pleasure to her craving sense deny'd  But unreserv'd with every fresh delight  Did prodigally feast her appetite  Age drawing on when through her youth's decay  Her servants with her beauty drop away  For winter quarters she Religion takes  And of necessity a virtue makes  And when the wrinkles of her face no cure  Will longer from the help of art endure  Covering the wornout sinner with the saint  As once her face she now her soul does paint  Since churches are not must religion be  Of guilty persons still the sanctuary  When great men fall or popular men would rise  Both from religion borrow their disguise  Then like Achilles in his fateproof arms  They boldly march guided with holy charms  And browbeat Caesar and defy his laws  Who dare resist the champion of God's cause  But when the place or pension is your own  When the opposing party is run down  Religion and God's cause aside are cast  Like actor's habit when the play is past  This dame Hypocrisy with sour face  Does fit supply old mother Mosely's place  She for his body did provision find  This caters for the letchery of his mind  And for his vast ambition and his pride  And his insatiate avarice does provide  His body thus and soul together vie  In Vice's empire for the sovereignty  In ulcers that this does abound in sin  Lazar without and Lucifer within  The silverpipe  An allusion to a chirurgical instrument N  is no sufficient drain  For the corruption of this little man  Who though he ulcers have in every part  Is no where so corrupt as in his heart  ON SEEING A BANK OF PRIMROSES IN JANUARY COVERED WITH SNOW  BY MR THOMAS FOXTON  Author of "The Metamorphosis of Mr Pope into a Stingingnettle" at the end of "The Female Dunciad" and translator of Burnet's "Archaeologia Philosophica" and his tract "De futurâ Judaeorum Restauratione" N    THESE forward roses spread an infant bloom  Lavish at once of beauty and perfume  Their yellow leaves with fragrant pride display  And smile all lovely on the rising day  Ambitious seem to deck some virgin's breast  And there for ever lay their fading sweets to rest  But cruel chance keen Eastern gales arise  And drive the Winter through the hazy skies  These pretty flowers can now no longer glow  Pierc'd with the frost and buried under snow  If still relentless storms persist to beat  And chilling vapours damp the genial heat  There 's no relief these gaudy sweets must die  And all their pregnant charms in long oblivion lie  But should the sun in majesty serene  Adorn the grove and paint the burnish'd green  Each drooping rose its mournful head would rear  Bright as the heavens and like the morning fair  While purple honours crown the welldistinguish'd year  ON THE CASTLE OF DUBLIN  BY DR PARNELL  Thomas Parnell DD descended from an antient family of Congleton in Cheshire was born in Dublin in the year and was admitted a member of Dublin College at the early age of thirteen He took his degree of MA July and in the same year was ordained a deacon by Dr William King then bishop of Derry having a dispensation from the primate as being under twentythree years of age He was admitted into priests orders about three years after by Dr King then archbishop of Dublin and was collated by Dr St George Ashe bishop of Clogher to the archdeaconry of Clogher Feb About that time also he married Miss Anne Minchin a young lady of great merit and beauty by whom he had two sons who died young and a daughter living in Swift in his Journal to Stella August say  "I am heartily for poor Mrs Parnell's death she seemed ro be an excellent goodnatured young woman and I believe the poor lad is much afflicted they appeared to live perfectly well together"  This event is supposed to have made an indelible impression on his spirits He was warmly recommended by the Dean to archbishop King who gave him a prebend in and the vicarage of Finglas worth about l a year May His gratitude is beautifully expressed in a poem on the Dean's birthday He died at Chester in July on his way to Ireland and was buried in Trinity church in that town without any monument to mark the place of his interment As he left no male issue his estate devolved to his only nephew Sir Sir John Parnell baronet whose father was younger brother to the archdeacon and one of the justices of the king's bench in Ireland The character of Dr Parnell is admirably pourtrayed by Dr Goldsmith in the Life prefixed to a volume of his Poems originally published by Mr Pope in A posthumous volume was printed at Dublin in And both these volumes united with several additional poems which I had formerly collected are printed in the fortyfourth volume of the "English Poets" N      THIS house and inhabitants both well agree  And resemble each other as near as can be  One half is decay'd and in want of a prop  The other newbuilt but not finish'd at top  ON THE DEATH OF MR VINER  BY DR PARNELL  IS Viner dead and shall each Muse become  Silent as Death and as his music dumb  Shall he depart without a Poet's praise  Who oft to harmony has tun'd their lays  Shall he who knew the elegance of sound  Find no one voice to sing him to the ground  Music and Poetry are sisterarts  Shew a like genius and consenting hearts  My soul with his is secretly ally'd  And I am forc'd to speak since Viner dy'd  Oh that my Muse as once his notes could swell  That I might all his praises fully tell  That I might say with how much skill he play'd  How nimbly four extended strings survey'd  How bow and fingers with a noble strife  Did raise the vocal fiddle into life  How various sounds in various order rang'd  By unobserv'd degrees minutely chang'd  Through a vast space could in divisions run  Be all distinct yet all agree in one  And how the fleeter notes could swiftly pass  And skip alternately from place to place  The strings could with a sudden impulse bound  Speak every touch and tremble into sound  The liquid harmony a tuneful tide  Now seem'd to rage anon would gently glide  By turns would ebb and flow would rise and fall  Be loudly daring or be softly small  While all was blended in one common name  Wave push'd on wave and all compos'd a stream  The different tones melodiously combin'd  Temper'd with art in sweet confusion join'd  The soft the strong the clear the shrill the deep  Would sometimes soar aloft and sometimes creep  While every soul upon his motions hung  As though it were in tuneful concert strung  His touch did strike the fibres of the heart  And a like trembling secretly impart  Where various passions did by turns succeed  He made it chearful and he made it bleed  Could wind it up into a glowing fire  Then shift the scene and teach it to expire  Oft have I seen him on a public stage  Alone the gaping multitude engage  The eyes and ears of each spectator draw  Command their thoughts and give their passions law  While other music in oblivion drown'd  Seem'd a dead pulse or a neglected sound  Alas he 's gone our great Apollo 's dead  And all that's sweet and tuneful with him fled  Hibernia with one universal cry  Laments the loss and speaks his elegy  Farewell thou author of refin'd delight  Too little known too soon remov'd from sight  Those fingers which such pleasure did convey  Must now become to stupid worms a prey  Thy grateful fiddle will for ever stand  A silent mourner for its master's hand  Thy art is only to be match'd above  Where Music reigns and in that Music Love  Where thou wilt in the happy chorus join  And quickly thy melodious soul refine  To the exalted pitch of Harmony Divine  EPIGRAM  BY DR PARNELL  " Haud facile emergunt quorum virtutibus obstat  " Res angusta domi"  THE greatest gifts that Nature does bestow  Can't unassisted to perfection grow  A scanty fortune clips the wings of Fame  And checks the progress of a rising name  Each dastard virtue drags a captive's chain  And moves but slowly for it moves with pain  Domestic cares sit hard upon the mind  And cramp those thoughts which should be unconfin'd  The cries of Poverty alarm the soul  Abate its vigour its designs control  The stings of Want inflict the wounds of Death  And motion always ceases with the breath  The love of friends is found a languid fire  That glares but faintly and will soon expire  Weak is its force nor can its warmth be great  A feeble light begets a feeble heat  Wealth is the fuel that must feed the flame  It dies in rags and scarce deserves a name  LOVE IN DISGUISE  BY DR PARNELL  TO stifle passion is no easy thing  A heart in love is always on the wing  The bold betrayer flutters still  And fans the breath prepar'd to tell  It melts the tongue and tunes the throat  And moves the lips to form the note  And when the speech is lost  It then sends out its ghost  A little sigh  To say we die  'Tis strange the air that cools a flame should prove  But wonder not it is the air of love  Yet Chloris I can make my love look well  And cover bleeding wounds I can't conceal  My words such artful accents break  You think I rather act than speak  My sighs enliven'd through a smile  Your unsuspecting thoughts beguile  My eyes are vary'd so  You can't their wishes know  And I'm so gay  You think I play  Happy contrivance such as can't be priz'd  To live in love and yet to live disguis'd  CHLORIS APPEARING IN A LOOKINGGLASS  BY DR PARNELL  OFT have I seen a piece of art  Of light and shade the mixture fine  Speak all the passions of the heart  And shew true life in every line  But what is this before my eyes  With every feature every grace  That strikes with love and with surprize  And gives me all the vital face  It is not Chloris for behold  The shifting phantom comes and goes  And when 'tis here 'tis pale and cold  Nor any female softness knows  But 'tis her image for I feel  The very pains that Chloris gives  Her charms are there I know them well  I see what in my bosom lives  Oh could I but the picture save  'Tis drawn by her own matchless skill  Nature the lively colours gave  And she need only look to kill  Ah fairone will it not suffice  That I should once your victim lie  Unless you multiply your eyes  And strive to make me doubly die  ON A LADY WITH FOUL BREATH  BY DR PARNELL  ART thou alive It cannot be  There 's so much rottenness in thee  Corruption only is in death  And what 's more putrid than thy breath  Think not you live because you speak  For graves such hollow sounds can make  And respiration can't suffice  For vapours do from caverns rise  From thee such noisome stenches come  Thy mouth betrays thy breast a tomb  Thy body is a corpse that goes  By magic rais'd from its repose  A pestilence that walks by day  But falls at night to worms and clay  But I will to my Chloris run  Who will not let me be undone  The sweets her virginbreath contains  Are fitted to remove my pains  There will I healing nectar sip  And to be sav'd approach her lip  Though if I touch the matchless dame  I 'm sure to burn with inward flame  Thus when I would one danger shun  I 'm straight upon another thrown  I seek a cure one sore to ease  Yet in that cure 's a new disease  But Love though fatal still can bless  And greater dangers hide the less  I 'll go where passion bids me fly  And choose my death since I must die  As Doves pursued by birds of prey  Venture with milder man to stay  ON THE NUMBER THREE  BY DR PARNELL  BEAUTY rests not in one fix'd place  But seems to reign in every face  'Tis nothing sure but fancy then  In various forms bewitching men  Or is its shape and colour fram'd  Proportion just and Woman nam'd  If Fancy only rul'd in Love  Why should it then so strongly move  Or why should all that look agree  To own its mighty power in Three  In Three it shews a different face  Each shining with peculiar grace  Kindred a native likeness gives  Which pleases as in all it lives  And where the features disagree  We praise the dear variety  Then Beauty surely ne'er was yet  So much unlike itself and so complete  ESSAY ON THE DIFFERENT STYLES OF POETRY  This and the preceding Poems by Dr Parnell as has been already said of Dr Yalden were omitted in the former collection only because they could not then be met with I cannot but take this opportunity of correcting a mistake which I was led into by Dr Birch in the note on the English Poets vol XLIV p What is there said on the Poem on Queen Anne's Peace more probably belongs to this Essay The peace was not signed till March By Swift's Journal to Stella Dec Jan and Feb it appears that this poem received several corrections in consequence of hints from Dr Swift who introduced Parnell both to Oxford and Bolingbroke N    TO HENRY LORD VISCOUNT BOLINGBROKE  BY DR PARNELL  Allegory is in itself so retired a way of Writing that it was thought proper to say something beforehand concerning this Piece which is entirely framed upon it The design therefore is to shew the several Styles which have been made use of by those who have endeavoured to write in verse The scheme by which it is carried on supposes an old Grecian Poet couching his observations or instructions within an Allegory which Allegory is wrought out upon the single word Flight as in the figurative way it signifies a thought above the common level here Wit is made to be Pegasus and the Poet his Rider who flies by several countries where he must not touch by which are meant so many vicious Styles and arrives at last at the Sublime This way of Writing is not only very engaging to the fancy whenever it is well performed but it has been thought also one of the first that the Poets made use of Hence arose many of those stories concerning the Heathen Gods which at first were invented to insinuate Truth and Morality more pleasingly and which afterwards made Poetry itself more solemn when they happened to be received into the Heathen Divinity And indeed there seems to be no likelier way by which a Poetical Genius may yet appear as an Original than that he should proceed with a full compass of thought and knowledge either to design his plan or to beautify the parts of it in an allegorical manner We are much beholden to Antiquity for those excellent compositions by which Writers at present form their minds but it is not so much required of us to adhere merely to their fables as to observe their manner For if we preclude our own invention Poetry will consist only in expression or simile or the application of old stories and the utmost character to which a Genius can arrive will depend on imitation or a borrowing from others which we must agree together not to call stealing because we take only from the Ancients There have been Poets amongst ourselves such as Spenser and Milton who have successfully ventured further These instances may let us see that Invention is not bounded by what has been done before they may open our imaginations and be one method of preserving us from Writing without schemes As for what relates any further particularly to this Poem the Reader will observe that its aim is Instruction Perhaps a representation of several mistakes and difficulties which happen to many who write Poetry may deter some from attempting what they have not been made for and perhaps the description of several beauties belonging to it may afford hints towards forming a Genius for delighting and improving mankind If either of these happen the Poem is useful and upon that account its faults may be more easily excused PARNELL    "Vatibus addere calcar  " Ut studio majore petant Helicona virentem"  HOR Ep II  I HATE the vulgar with untuneful mind  Hearts uninspir'd and senses unrefin'd  Hence ye prophane I raise the sounding string  And Bolingbroke defcends to hear me sing  When Greece could truth in Mystie Fable shroud  And with delight instruct the listening crowd  An ancient Poet Time has lost his name  Deliver'd strains on Verse to future fame  Still as he sung he touch'd the trembling lyre  And felt the notes a rising warmth inspire  Ye sweetening Graces in the Music throng  Assist my genius and retrieve the song  From dark oblivion See my genius goes  To call it forth 'Twas thus the Poem rose  " WIT is the Muses' horse and bears on high  The daring rider to the Muses' sky  Who while his strength to mount aloft he tries  By regions varying in their nature flies  At first he riseth o'er a land of toil  A barren hard and undeserving soil  Where only weeds from heavy labour grow  Which yet the nation prune and keep for show  Where couplets jingling on their accent run  Whose Point of Epigram is sunk to Pun  Where  These and the like conceits of putting Poems into seveshapes by the different lengths of lines are frequent in old Poets of most languages PARNELL  wings by fancy never feather'd fly  Where lines by measure form'd in Hatchets lie  Where Altars stand erected Porches gape  And sense is cramp'd while words are par'd to shape  Where mean Acrosticks labour'd in a frame  On scatter'd letters raise a painful scheme  And by confinement in their work control  The great enlargings of the boundless soul  Where if a warrior's elevated fire  Would all the brightest strokes of verse require  Then straight in Anagram a wretched crew  Will pay their undeserving praises too  While on the rack his poor disjointed name  Must tell its master's character to Fame  And if my fire and fears aright presage  The labouring writers of a future age  Shall clear new ground and grots and caves repair  To civilize the babbling echoes there  Then while a lover treads a lonely walk  His voice shall with its own reflection talk  The closing sounds of all the vain device  Select by trouble frivolously nice  Resound through verse and with a false pretence  Support the dialogue and pass for sense  Can things like these to lasting praise pretend  Can any Muse the worthless toil befriend  Ye sacred Virgins in my thoughts ador'd  Ah be for ever in my lines deplor'd  If tricks on words acquire an endless name  And trifles merit in the court of Fame"  At this the Poet stood concern'd a while  And view'd his objects with a scornful smile  Then other images of different kind  With different workings enter'd on his mind  At whose approach he felt the former gone  And shiver'd in conceit and thus went on  " By a cold region next the Rider goes  Where all lies cover'd in eternal snows  Where no bright Genius drives the chariot high  To glitter on the ground and gild the sky  Bleak level Realm where Frigid Styles abound  Where never yet a daring thought was found  But counted feet is Poetry defin'd  And starv'd conceits that chill the reader's mind  A little sense in many words imply  And drag in loitering numbers slowly by  Here dry sententious speeches half asleep  Prolong'd in lines o'er many pages creep  Nor ever shew the passions well express'd  Nor raise like passions in another's breast  Here flat narrations fair exploits debase  In measures void of every shining grace  Which never arm their hero for the field  Nor with prophetic story paint the shield  Nor six the crest nor make the feathers wave  Nor with their characters reward the brave  Undeck'd they stand and unadorn'd with praise  And fail to profit while they fail to please  Here forc'd Description is so strangely wrought  It never stamps its image on the thought  The lifeless trees may stand for ever bare  And rivers stop for aught the readers care  They see no branches trembling in the woods  Nor hear the murmurs of increasing floods  Which near the roots of ruffled waters flow  And shake the shadows of the boughs below  Ah sacred Verse replete with heavenly flame  Such cold endeavours would invade thy name  The writer fondly would in these survive  Which wanting spirit never seem'd alive  But if Applause or Fame attend his pen  Let breathless statues pass for breathing men"  Here seem'd the Singer touch'd at what he sung  And grief a while delay'd his hand and tongue  But soon he check'd his fingers chose a strain  And flourish'd shrill and thus arose again  " Pass the next region which appears to show  'Tis very open unimprov'd and low  No noble flights of elevated thought  No nervous strength of sense maturely wrought  Possess this Realm but common turns are there  Which idly sportive move with childish air  On callow wings and like a plague of flies  The little fancies in a Poem rise  The jaded Reader every where to strike  And move his passions every where alike  There all the graceful nymphs are forc'd to play  Where any water bubbles in the way  There shaggy Satyrs are oblig'd to rove  In all the fields and over all the grove  There every star is summon'd from its sphere  To dress one face and make Clorinda fair  There Cupids fling their darts in every song  While Nature stands neglected all along  Till the teaz'd hearer vex'd at last to find  One constant object still assault the mind  Admires no more at what's no longer new  And hastes to shun the persecuting view  There bright surprizes of Poetic rage  Whose strength and beauty more confirm'd in age  For having lasted last the longer still  By weak attempts are imitated ill  Or carried on beyond their proper light  Or with refinement flourish'd out of sight  There Metaphors on Metaphors abound  And sense by differing images confound  Strange injudicious management of thought  Not born to rage nor into method brought  Ah sacred Muse from such a Realm retreat  Nor idly waste the influence of thy heat  On shallow soils where quick productions rise  And wither as the warmth that rais'd them dies"  Here o'er his breast a sort of pity roll'd  Which something labouring in the mind control'd  And made him touch the loud resounding strings  While thus with Music's stronger tones he sings  " Mount higher still still keep thy faithful seat  Mind the firm reins and curb thy courser's heat  Nor let him touch the Realms that next appear  Whose hanging turrets seem a fall to fear  And strangely stand along the tracts of air  Where thunder rolls and bearded comets glare  The thoughts that most extravagantly soar  The words that sound as if they meant to roar  For rant and noise are offer'd here to choice  And stand elected by the public voice  All schemes are slighted which attempt to shine  At once with strange and probable design  'Tis here a mean conceit a vulgar view  That bears the least respect to seeming true  While every trifling turn of things is seen  To move by Gods descending in machine  Here swelling lines with stalking strut proceed  And in the clouds terrific rumblings breed  Here single heroes deal grim deaths around  And armies perish in tremendous sound  Here fearful monsters are preserv'd to die  In such a tumult as affrights the sky  For which the golden sun shall hide with dread  And Neptune lift his sedgymatted head  Admire the roar and dive with dire dismay  And seek his deepest chambers in the sea  To raise their subject thus the lines devise  And false extravagance would fain surprize  Yet still ye Gods ye live untouch'd by fear  And undisturb'd at bellowing monsters here  But with compassion guard the brain of men  If thus they bellow through the Poet's pen  So will the Reader's eyes discern aright  The rashest sally from the noblest flight  And find that only boast and sound agree  To seem the life and voice of majesty  When Writers rampant on Apollo call  And bid him enter and possess them all  And make his flames afford a wild pretence  To keep them unrestrain'd by common sense  Ah sacred Verse lest Reason quit thy seat  Give none to such or give a gentler heat"  'Twas here the Singer felt his temper wrought  By fairer prospects which arose to thought  And in himself a while collected sat  And much admir'd at this and much at that  Till all the beauteous forms in order ran  And then he took their track and thus began  " Above the beauties far above the show  In which weak Nature dresses here below  Stands the great palace of the Bright and Fine  Where fair ideas in full glory shine  Eternal models of exalted parts  The pride of minds and conquerors of hearts  Upon the first arrival here are seen  Rang'd walks of bay the Muses' evergreen  Each sweetly springing from some sacred bough  Whose circling shade adorn'd a Poet's brow  While through the leaves in unmolested skies  The gentle breathing of applauses flies  And flattering sounds are heard within the breze  And pleasing murmur runs among the trees  And falls of water join the flattering sounds  And murmur softening from the shore rebounds  The warbled melody the lovely sights  The calms of solitude inspire delights  The dazzled eyes the ravish'd ears are caught  The panting heart unites to purer thought  And grateful shiverings wander o'er the skin  And wondrous ecstasies arise within  Whence admiration overflows the mind  And leaves the pleasure felt but undefin'd  Stay daring Rider now no longer rove  Now pass to find the palace through the grove  Whate'er you see whate'er you feel display  The Realm you sought for daring Rider stay  Here various Fancy spreads a varied scene  And Judgement likes the sight and looks serene  And can be pleas'd itself and helps to please  And joins the work and regulates the lays  Thus on a plan design'd by double care  The building rises in the glitterring air  With just agreement fram'd in every part  And smoothly polish'd with the nicest art  Here laurelboughs which ancient heroes wore  Now not so fading as they prov'd before  Wreath round the pillars which the Poets rear  And slope their points to make a foliage there  Here chaplets pull'd in gentlybreathing wind  And wrought by lovers innocently kind  Hung o'er the porch their fragrant odours give  And fresh in lasting song for ever live  The shades for whom with such indulgent care  Fame wreaths the boughs or hangs the chaplets there  To deathless honours thus preserv'd above  For ages conquer or for ages love  Here bold Description paints the walls within  Her pencil touches and the world is seen  The fields look beauteous in their flowery pride  The mountains rear aloft the vales subside  The cities rise the rivers seem to play  And hanging rocks repell the foaming sea  The foaming seas their angry billows show  Curl'd white above and darkly roll'd below  Or cease their rage and as they calmly lie  Return the pleasing pictures of the sky  The skies extended in an open view  Appear a lofty distant arch of blue  In which Description stains the painted bow  Or thickens clouds and feathersout the snow  Or mingles blushes in the morning ray  Or gilds the noon or turns an evening gray  Here on the pedestals of War and Peace  In different rows and with a different grace  Fine Statues proudly ride or nobly stand  To which Narration with a pointing hand  Directs the sight and makes examples please  By boldly venturing to dilate in praise  While chosen beauties lengthen out the song  Yet make her hearers never think it long  Or if with closer art with sprightly mien  Scarce like herself and more like Action seen  She bids their facts in images arise  And seem to pass before the Reader's eyes  The words like charms inchanted motion give  And all the Statues of the Palace live  Then hosts embattled stretch their lines afar  Their leaders' speeches animate the war  The trumpets sound the feather'd arrows fly  The sword is drawn the lance is toss'd on high  The brave presson the fainter forces yield  And death in different shapes deforms the field  Or should the shepherds be dispos'd to play  Amintor's jolly pipe beguiles the day  And jocund Echos dally with the sound  And Nymphs in measures trip along the ground  And ere the dews have wet the grass below  Turn homewards singing all the way they go  Here as on circumstance Narrations dwell  And tell what moves and hardly seem to tell  The toil of Heroes on the dusty plains  Or on the green the merriment of Swains  Reflection speaks then all the Forms that rose  In life's inchanted scene themselves compose  Whilst the grave voice controling all the spells  With solemn utterance thus the Moral tells  " So Public Worth its enemies destroys  Or Private Innocence itself enjoys"  Here all the Passions for their greater sway  In all the power of words themselves array  And hence the soft Pathetic gently charms  And hence the bolder fills the breast with arms  Sweet Love in numbers finds a world of darts  And with Desirings wounds the tender hearts  Fair Hope displays its pinions to the wind  And flutters in the lines and lifts the mind  Brisk Joy with transport fills the rising strain  Breaks in the notes and bounds in every vein  Stern Courage glittering in the sparks of Ire  Inflames those lays that set the breast on fire  Aversion learns to fly with swifter will  In numbers taught to represent an ill  By frightful accents Fear produces fears  By sad expression Sorrow melts to tears  And dire Amazement and Despair are brought  By words of Horror through the wilds of thought  'Tis thus tumultuous Passions learn to roll  Thus arm'd with Poetry they win the soul  Pass further through the Dome another view  Would now the pleasures of thy mind renew  Where oft Description for the colours goes  Which raise and animate its native shows  Where oft Narration seeks a florid grace  To keep from sinking ere 'tis time to cease  Where easy turns Reflection looks to find  When Morals aim at dress to please the mind  Where lively Figures are for use array'd  And these an Action those a Passion aid  There modest Metaphors in order sit  With unaffected undisguising Wit  That leave their own and seek another's place  Not forc'd but changing with an easy pace  To deck a notion faintly seen before  And Truth preserves her shape and shines the more  By these the beauteous Similes reside  In look more open in design ally'd  Who fond of likeness from another's face  Bring every feature's corresponding grace  With near approaches in expression flow  And take the turn their pattern loves to show  As in a glass the shadows meet the fair  And dress and practise with resembling air  Thus Truth by pleasure doth her aim pursue  Looks bright and fixes on the doubled view  There Repetitions one another meet  Expressly strong or languishingly sweet  And raise the sort of sentiment they please  And urge the sort of sentiment they raise  There close in order are the Questions plac'd  Which march with art conceal'd in shows of haste  And work the Reader till his mind be brought  To make its answers in the Writer's thought  For thus the moving Passions seem to throng  And with their quickness force the soul along  And thus the soul grows fond they should prevail  When every Question seems a fair appeal  And if by just degrees of strength they soar  In steps as equal each affects the more  There strange Commotion naturally shown  Speaks on regardless that she speaks alone  Nor minds if they to whom she talks be near  Nor cares if that to which she talks can hear  The warmth of Anger dares an absent Foe  The words of Pity speak to tears of Woe  The Love that hopes on errands sends the breeze  And Love despairing moans to naked trees  There stand the new Creations of the Muse  Poetic Persons whom the Writers use  Whene'er a cause magnificently great  Would fix attention with peculiar weight  'Tis hence that humble Provinces are seen  Transform'd to Matrons with neglected mien  Who call their Warriors in a mournful sound  And shew their Crowns of Turrets on the ground  While over Urns reclining Rivers moan  They should enrich a nation not their own  'Tis hence the Virtues are no more confin'd  To be but rules of reason in the mind  The heavenly Forms start forth appear to breathe  And in bright shapes converse with men beneath  And as a God in combat Valour leads  In council Prudence as a Goddess aids  There Exclamations all the voice employ  In sudden flushes of Concern or Joy  Then seem the sluices which the Passions bound  To burst asunder with a speechless sound  And then with tumult and surprize they roll  And shew the case important in the soul  There rising Sentences attempt to speak  Which Wonder Sorrow Shame or Anger break  But so the Part directs to find the rest  That what remains behind is more than guess'd  Thus fill'd with ease yet left unfinish'd too  The sense looks large within the Reader's view  He freely gathers all the Passion means  And artful silence more than words explains  Methinks a thousand Graces more I see  And I could dwellbut when would thought be free  Engaging Method ranges all the band  And smooth Transition joins them hand in hand  Around the musick of my lays they throng  Ah too deserving objects of my song  Live wondrous Palace live secure of time  To Senses Harmony to Souls sublime  And just Proportion all and great Design  And lively Colours and an Air divine  'Tis here that guided by the Muses' fire  And fill'd with sacred thought her Friends retire  Unbent to care and unconcern'd with noise  To taste repose and elevated joys  Which in a deep untroubled leisure meet  Serenely ravishing politely sweet  From hence the Charms that most engage they choose  And as they please the glittering objects use  While to their Genius more than Art they trust  Yet Art acknowledges their labours just  From hence they look from this exalted show  To choose their subject in the world below  And where an Hero well deserves a name  They consecrate his acts in song to Fame  Or if a Science unadorn'd they find  They smooth its look to please and teach the mind  And where a Friendship 's generously strong  They celebrate the knot of souls in song  Or if the Verses must inflame Desire  The thoughts are melted and the words on fire  But when the Temples deck'd with glory stand  And hymns of Gratitude the Gods demand  Their bosoms kindle with Celestial Love  And then alone they cast their eyes above  Hail sacred Verse ye sacred Muses hail  Could I your pleasures with your fire reveal  The world might then be taught to know you right  And court your rage and envy my delight  But whilst I follow where your pointed beams  My course directing shoot in golden streams  The bright appearance dazzles Fancy's eyes  And weary'dout the fix'd Attention lies  Enough my Verses have you work'd my breast  I'll seek the sacred Grove and sink to rest"  No longer now the ravish'd Poet sung  His voice in easy cadence left the tongue  Nor o'er the musick did his fingers fly  The sounds ran tingling and they seem'd to die  O Bolingbroke O Favourite of the skies  O born to gifts by which the noblest rise  Improv'd in arts by which the brightest please  Intent to business and polite for ease  Sublime in eloquence where loud applause  Hath stil'd thee Patron of a nation's cause  'Twas there the world perceiv'd and own'd thee great  Thence Anna call'd thee to the reins of State  " Go said the greatest Queen with Oxford go  And still the tumults of the world below  Exert thy powers and prosper he that knows  To move with Oxford never should repose"  She spake the Patriot overspread thy mind  And all thy days to public good resign'd  Else might thy soul so wonderfully wrought  For every depth and turn of curious thought  To this the Poet's sweet recess  That his Lordship occasionally cultivated the Muses may be seen in the fourth volume of this Miscellany N  retreat  And thence report the pleasures of the seat  Describe the raptures which a Writer knows  When in his breast a vein of fancy glows  Describe his business while he works the mine  Describe his temper when he sees it shine  Or say when Readers easy verse insnares  How much the Writer's mind can act on theirs  Whence images in charming numbers set  A sort of likeness in the soul beget  And what fair visions oft we fancy nigh  By fond delusions of the swimming eye  Or further pierce through Nature's maze to find  How passions drawn give passions to the mind  Oh what a sweet confusion what surprize  How quick the shifting views of pleasure rise  While lightly skimming with a transient wing  I touch the beauties which I wish to sing  Is Verse a sovereign Regent of the soul  And fitted all its motions to control  Or are they sisters tun'd at once above  And shake like unisons if either move  For when the numbers sing an eager sight  I've heard a soldier's voice express delight  I've seen his eyes with crowding spirits shine  And round his hilt his hand unthinking twine  When from the shore the fickle Trojan flies  And in sweet measures poor Eliza dies  I've seen the book forsake the virgin's hand  And in her eyes the tears but hardly stand  I've known her blush at soft Corinna's name  And in red characters confess a flame  Or wish success had more adorn'd his arms  Who gave the world for Cleopatra's charms  Ye Sons of Glory be my first appeal  If here the power of lines these lines reveal  When some great youth has with impetuous thought  Read o'er atchievements which another wrought  And seen his courage and his honour go  Through crowding nations in triumphant show  His soul enchanted by the words he reads  Shines all impregnated with sparkling seeds  And courage here and honour there appears  In brave design that soars beyond his years  And this a spear and that a chariot lends  And war and triumph he by turns attends  Thus gallant pleasures are his waking dream  Till some fair cause have call'd him forth to fame  Then form'd to life on what the Poet made  And breathing slaughter and in arms array'd  He marches forward on the daring foe  And emulation acts in every blow  Great Hector's shade in fancy stalks along  From rank to rank amongst the martial throng  While from his acts he learns a noble rage  And shines like Hector in the present age  Thus verse will raise him to the victor's bays  And verse that rais'd him shall resound his praise  Ye tender Beauties be my witness too  If Song can charm and if my Song be true  With sweet experience oft a Fair may find  Her passions mov'd by passions well design'd  And then she longs to meet a gentle swain  And longs to love and to be lov'd again  And if by chance an amorous youth appears  With pants and blushes she the courtship hears  And finds a tale that must with theirs agree  And he's Septimius and his Acme  " With such a husband such a wife  " With Acme and Septimius' life"  is the conclusion of Cowley's beautiful imitation of Catullus in the English Poets vol I p On these lines an excellent Prelate has observed that to the honour of Cowley's morals and good taste by a small deviation from his original he has converted a loose lovepoem into a sober epithalamium we have all the grace and what is more all the warmth of Catullus without his indecency N  she  Thus lost in thought her melted heart she gives  And the rais'd Lover by the Poet lives  THE COUNTERSCUFFLE  These poems are preserved on account of the many droll anecdotes they contain "The Chimney's Scuffle " a very indifferent poem seems to have given rise to this and many other of similar titles among others to "Fragmenta Carceris or The King'sBench Scuffle with the Humours of the Commonside the King'sBench Litany and the Legend of Duke Humphrey by Samuel Speed a Member of that Royal Society " N      WHEREUNTO IS ADDED THE COUNTERRAT WRITTEN BY R S  These initials are possibly intended for Sir Roger L'Estrange who among other vicissitudes of fortune spent near six years in gaols and almost four under a sentence of death in Newgate  Richard Steere  the only contemporary poet I can find with these initials was author of some wellmeaning but indifferent verses on a religious subject called "The History of the Babylonish Cabal or the Intrigues Progression Opposition Defeat and Destruction of the DanielCatchers " N    LET that majestic pen that writes  Of brave King Arthur and his Knights  And of their noble feats and fights  And those who tell of Mice and Frogs  And of the skirmishes of Hogs  And of fierce Bears and Mastiff Dogs  be silent  And now let each one listen well  While I the famous Battle tell  In WoodstreetCounter that befell  in high Lent  In which great scuffle only twain  Without much hurt or being slain  Immortal honour did obtain  by merit  One was a Captain in degree  A strong and lusty man was he  T' other a Tradesman bold and free  of spirit  And though he was no man of force  He had a stomach like a horse  And in his rage had no remorse  or pity  Full nimbly could he cuss and clout  And was accounted without doubt  One of the prettiest sparks about  the city  And at his weapon any way  He could perform a single f  ay  Even from the long pike to the Taylor's  bodkin  He reckt not for his flesh a jot  He fear'd not Englishman nor Scot  For man or monster car'd he not  a dodkin  For fighting was his recreation  And like a man in desperation  For Law Edict or Proclamation  he car'd not  And in his anger cause being given  To lift his hand 'gainst good Sir Steeven  Or any justice under Heaven  he fear'd not  He durst his enemy withstand  Or at Tergoos or CalisSand  And bravely there with sword in hand  would greet him  And noble Ellis was his name  Who 'mongst his foes to purchase fame  Not cared though the Devil came  to meet him  And this brave Goldsmith was the man  Who first this worthy brawl began  Which after ended in a can  of mild beer  But had you seen him when he fought  How eagerly for blood he sought  There's no man but would have him thought  a wild bear  Imagine now you see a score  Of madcap gentlemen or more  Boys that did use to roist and roar  and swagger  Among the which were three or four  That rul'd themselves by wisdom's lore  Whose very grandfires scarcely wore  a dagger  A Priest and Lawyer men well read  In wiping spoons and chipping bread  And falling to short grace being said  full  oundly  Whose hungry maws no sallads need  Good appetites therein to breed  Their stomachs without sauce could feed  profoundly  'Twas ill that men of sober diet  Who lov'd to fill their guts in quiet  Were plac'd with ruffians that to riot  were given  And O great grief e'en from their food  Their stomachs too being strong and good  And that sweet place whereon it stood  be driven  But here 'tis sitting I repeat  What food our dainty prisoners eat  But if in placing of the meat  and dishes  From curious order I do swerve  'Tis that themselves did none observe  For which nor flesh they did deserve  nor fishes  But some perhaps will say that Lent  Affords them not what here is meant  So much so good and that they went  without it  'Tis like but if I add a dish  Or twain or three of flesh or fish  They either had or did it wish  ne'er doubt it  Then wipe your mouths while I declare  The goodness of this Lenten fare  Which is in prison very rare  I tell ye  Furmity sweet as any Nut  As good as ever swill'd a gut  And butter sweet as e'er was put  in belly  Eggs by the dozen new and good  Which in white salt uprightly stood  And meats which heat and stir the blood  to action  As butter'd Crabs and Lobsters red  Which send the married pair to bed  And in loose bloods have often bred  a faction  Fish butter'd to the platter's brim  And Parsnips did in butter swim  Strew'd o'er with pepper neat and trim  Salt Salmon  Smelts cry'd come eat me do not stay  Freshcod and Maids full neatly lay  And next to these a lusty Ba  con Gammon  Stuck thick with cloves upon the back  Well stuft with sage and for the smack  Daintily strew'd with pepper black  Sous'd Gurnet  Pickrell Sturgeon Tench and Trout  Meat far too good for such a rout  To tumble toss and throw about  and spurn it  The next a Neat'stongue neatly dry'd  Mustard and Sugar by his side  Roaches butter'd Flounders fry'd  hot Custard  Eels boil'd and broil'd and next they bring  Hertings that is the Fishes King  And then a courtly Poul of Ling  and Mustard  But stay I had almost forgot  The flesh which still stands piping hot  Some from the spit some from the pot  new taken  A Shoulder and a Leg of Mutton  As good as ever knife was put on  Which never were by a true glutton  forsaken  A Loin of Veal that would have dar'd  One of the hungriest of the Guard  And they sometimes will feed full hard  like tall men  And such as love the lusty Chine  But when that I shall sup or dine  God grant they be no Guests of mine  of all men  Thus the descriptions are compleat  Which I have made of Men and Meat  Mars aid me now while I repeat  the battle  Where pots and stools were us'd as gins  To break each other's heads and shins  Where blows did make bones in their skins  to rattle  Where men to madness never ceas'd  Till each one furious as a beast  Had spoil'd the fashion of a feast  full dainty  Whereon had they not been accurst  They might have fed till bellies burst  But Ellis shew'd himself the worst  of twenty  For he began this monstrous brawl  Which afterwards incens'd them all  To throw the meat about the hall  that even  And now give ear unto the jar  That fell between these men of war  Wherein so many a harmless scar  was given  The board thus finish'd each man sate  Some fell to feeding some to prate  'Mong whom a jarring question strait  was risen  For they grew hotly in dispute  What calling was of most repute  'Twas well their wits were so acute  in prison  THE PARSON  While they discours'd the Parson blithe  Fed as he meant to have the tithe  Of every dish being sharp as scythe  in feeding  But haste had almost made him choke  Or else perhaps he would have spoke  In praise of his long threadbare cloak  and breeding  THE LAWYER  But after a deliberate pause  The Lawyer spoke as he had cause  In commendation of the Laws  profession  " The Law quoth he by a just doom  Doth censure all that to it come  And still defends the innocent from  oppression  It favours Truth it curbs the hope  Of Vice it gives Allegiance scope  Provides a gallows and a rope  for Treason  This doth the Law and this is it  Which makes us here in prison sit  Which grounded is on holy writ  and reason  To which all men must subject be  As we by daily proof do see  From highest to the low'st degree  the Scholar  Noble and Rich it doth subdue  The Soldier and his swaggering crew"  But at that word the Captain grew  in choler  THE SOLDIER  He look'd full grim and at first word  Rapt out an oath that shook the board  And struck his fist that the sound roar'd  like thunder  It made all skip that stood him near  The frighted Custard quak'd for fear  And those that heard it stricken were  with wonder  Nought did he now but frown and puff  And having star'd and swore enough  Thus he began in language rough  " Thou cogging  Base foysting Lawyer that dost set  Thy mind on nothing but to get  Thy living by thy damned pet  tifogging  A slave that shall for half a crown  With buckram bag and daggled gown  Wait like a dog about the town  and follow  A business on the Devil's part  For fees though not with law nor art  But head as empty as thy heart  is hollow  You stay at home and pocket fees  While we abroad our bloods do leese  And then with such base terms as these  you wrong us  But Lawyer it is safer far  For thee to prattle at a bar  Than once to shew thy face i' th' war  among us  Where to defend such thankless hinds  The soldier little quiet finds  But is expos'd to stormy winds  and weathers  And oft in blood he wades full deep  Your throats from foreign swords to keep  And wakes when you securely sleep  in feathers  What could your Laws and Statutes do  Against invasions of a Foe  Did not the valiant Soldier go  to quell them  And to prevent your further harms  With ensign fife and loud alarms  Of warlike drum by force of arms  repell them  Your Trespass Action will not stand  For setting foot upon your land  When they in scorn of your command  come hither  No remedy in Courts of Paul's  The Ecclesiastical Court N    In CommonPleas or in the Rolls  For jouling of your jobbernouls  together  Were 't not for us thou Swad quoth he  Where would'st thou fog to get a fee  But to defend such things as thee  'tis pity  For such as thou esteem us least  Whoever have been ready prest  To guard you and the Cuckow's nest  your city"  THE CITIZEN  That very word made Ellis start  And all his blood ran to his heart  He shook and quak'd in every part  with anger  He look'd as if nought might assuage  The heat of his enflamed rage  His very countenance did presage  some danger  " A Cuckow's nest" quoth he and so  He humm'd and held his head full low  As if distracted thoughts did o  verpress him  At length quoth he "My mother said  At Bristol she was broughttobed  And there was Ellis born and bred  God bless him  Of Londoncity I am free  And there I first my wife did see  And for that very cause quoth he  I love it  And he that calls it Cuckow's nest  Except he says he speaks in jest  He is a villain and a beast  I 'll prove it  This I 'll maintain nor do I care  Though Captain Potgun stamp and stare  And swagger swear and tear his hair  in fury  And with the hazard of my blood  I 'll fight up to the knees in mud  But I will make my quarrel good  assure ye  For though I am a man of trade  And free of Londoncity made  Yet can I use Gun Bill and Blade  in battle  And Citizens if need require  Themselves can force the foe retire  Whatever this LowCountry squire  do prattle  For we have Soldiers of our own  Able enough to guard the town  And Captains of most fair renown  about it  If any foe should fight amain  And set on us with all his train  We 'll make him to retire again  ne'er doubt it  We have fought well in dangers past  And will do while our lives do last  Without the help of any cast  Commanders  That hither come compell'd by want  With rusty swords and suits provant  From Utrecht Nimeguen or Ghent  in Flanders"  The Captain could no longer hold  But looking fiercely plainly told  The Citizen he was too bold  and call'd him  Proud Boy and for his saucy speech  Did vow shortly to whip his breech  Then Ellis snatcht the pot with which  he maul'd him  THE SCUFFLE  He threw the jug and therewithal  Did give the Captain such a maul  As made him thump against the wall  his crupper  With that the Captain took a dish  That stood brimfull of butter'd fish  As good as any heart could wish  to supper  And as he threw his foot did slide  Which turn'd his arm and dish aside  And all bebutterfishifide  Nick Ballat  And he good man did none disease  But sitting quiet and at his ease  With butter'd Rochets thought to please  his palate  But when he felt the wrong he had  He rag'd and swore and grew starkmad  Some in the room been better had  without him  For he took hold of any thing  And first he caught the Poul of Ling  Which he courageously did fling  about him  Out of his hand it flew apace  And hit the Lawyer in the face  Who at the board in highest place  was seated  And as the Lawyer thought to rise  The salt was thrown into his eyes  Which him of sight in woeful wise  defeated  All things near hand Nick Ballat threw  At length his butter'd Rochets flew  And hit by chance among the crew  the Parson  The sauce his coat did all bewet  The Priest began to fume and fret  The seat was butter'd which he set  his * * * * on  He knew not what to do or say  It was in vain to preach or pray  Or cry "You are all gone astray  good people"  He might as well go strive to teach  Divinty beyond his reach  Or when the bells ring out go preach  i' th' steeple  At this mischance the silly man  Out of the room would fain have ran  And very angerly began  to mutter  Ill luck had he for after that  One threw the Parsnips full of fat  Which stuck like Broaches in his hat  with butter  Out of the place he soon repairs  And ran half headlong down the stairs  And made complaint to Master Aires  with crying  Then up ran he to know the matter  And found how they the things did scatter  Here a Trencher there a Platter  were lying  I dare not say he stunk for woe  Nor will unless I did it know  But some there be that dare say so  that smelt him  Nor could you blame him if he did  For they threw dishes at his head  And did with Eggs and Loaves of Bread  bepelt him  He thrust himself into the throng  And us'd the virtue of his tongue  But what could one man's words among  so many  The Candles were all shuffled out  The Victuals flew afresh about  Was never such a combat fought  by any  Now in the dark was all the coil  Some were bloody in the broil  And some were steep'd in Salladoil  and Mustard  The sight would make a man afeard  Another had a butter'd beard  Another's face was was all besmear'd  with Custard  Others were daub'd up to the knee  With butter'd Fish and Furmity  And some the men could scarcely see  that beat them  Under the Boar Lluellin  Will Lluellin a prisoner there some time the keeper R S  lay  Being sore affrighted with the fray  And as the weapons flew that way  he eat them  The bread stuck in the windows all  Like bullets in a castlewall  Which furious foes did seek to scale  in battle  Shoulders of Mutton and Loins of Veal  Appointed for to serve the meal  About their ears full many a peal  did rattle  The which when Owen Blany  One of the underkeepers R S  spy'd  " Oh take away their arms he cry'd  Lest some great hurt do them betide  prevent it  And then the knave away did steal  Of food that fell no little deal  And in his house at many a meal  he spent it  The Captain ran the rest among  As eager to revenge the wrong  Done by the Pot which Ellis flung  so stoutly  And angry Ellis sought about  To find the furious Captain out  At length they met and then they fought  devoutly  Now being met they never lin  Till with their loud robustious din  The room and all that was therein  did rumble  Instead of weapons made of steel  The Captain took a salted Eel  And at each blow made Ellis reel  and tumble  Ellis a Pippinpie had got  A sorer weapon than the pot  For lo the apples being hot  did scald him  The Captain laid about him still  As if he would poor Ellis kill  And with his Eel with a good will  he maul'd him  At length quoth he "Ellis thou art  A fellow of courageous heart  Yield now and I will take thy part  hereafter"  Quoth Ellis "Much I scorn to hear  Thy words of threat being free from fear"  With which he hardly could forbear  from laughter  Together then afresh they fly  The Eel against the Pippinpie  But Blany stood there purposely  to watch them  The weapons wherewithal they fought  Were those for which he chiefly sought  And with an eager stomach thought  to catch them  But 'scap'd not now so well away  As at the Veal and Mutton fray  He thought to have with such a prey  his jaws fed  But all his hope did turn aside  He look'd for that which luck deny'd  For Ellis all bepippinpy'd  his calves head  Woe was the case he now was in  The apples hot did scald his skin  His skull as it had rotten been  did quoddle  With that one Fool among the rout  Made outcry all the house about  That Blany's brains were beaten out  his noddle  Which Lockwood  A Turnkey a sat fellow R S  hearing needs would see  What all this coil and stir might be  And up the stairs his guts and he  went waddling  But when he came the chamber near  Behind the door he stood to hear  For in he durst not come for fear  of swaddling  There stood he in a frightful case  And as by chance he stirr'd his face  Full in the mouth a butter'd Plaice  did hit him  Away he sneak'd and with his tongue  He lick'd and swallow'dup the wrong  And as he went the room along  be * * * * him  For help now doth poor Lockwood cry  " Oh bring a surgeon or I die  My guts out of my belly fly  come quickly"  Blany with open mouth likewise  For present help of surgeon cries  " Pity a man quoth he that lies  so sickly"  Phillips the skilful surgeon then  Was call'd and call'd and call'd again  If he had skill to cure these men  to shew it  At length he comes and first he puts  His hands to feel for Lockwood's guts  Which came not forth so sweet as nuts  all know it  He cries for water In the mean  One calls up Madge the Kitchinquean  To take and make the baby clean  and clout it  Fast by the nose she took the squall  And led him softly through the hall  Lest the perfume through knees should fall  about it  She turn'd his hose beneath the knee  Nor could she chuse but laugh to see  That yellow which was wont to be  a white breech  She took a dishclout off the shelf  And with it wip'd the sh***** elf  Which had not wit to help itself  poor ****breech  Thus leaving Lockwood all bewray'd  Unto the mercy of the maid  Who well deserved to be paid  for taking  Such homely pains now let us cast  Our thought back on the stir that's past  And them whose bones could not in haste  leave aching  And like the candles shall my pen  Shew you these gallants once again  Which now like Furies not like men  appeared  Fresh lights being brought t' appease the brawl  Shew twenty madmen in the hall  With blood and sauce their faces all  besmeared  Their cloaths all rent and souc'd in drink  Oil Mustard Butter and the stink  Which Lockwood left would make one think  in sadness  That these so monstrous creatures dwell  Either in Bedlam or in Hell  Or that no tongue or pen can tell  their madness  They were indeed disfigur'd so  Friend knew not friend nor foeman foe  For each man scarce himself did know  But after  A frantick staring round about  They suddenly did quit their doubt  And loudly all at once brake out  in laughter  The heat of all is now allay'd  The Keepers gently do persuade  And as before all friends are made  full kindly  Ellis the Captain doth embrace  The Captain doth return the grace  And so do all men in the place  as friendly  " By Jove I love thee" Ellis cry'd  The Captain soon as much reply'd  " Thou art quoth he a man well try'd  and Vulcan  With Mars at odds again shall be  Ere any jars 'twixt thee and me  And thereupon I drink to thee  a full can"  And then he kneel'd upon the ground  " Drink 't off quoth Ellis for this round  For ever shall be held renown'd  and never  May any quarrel 'twixt us twain  Arise or this renew again  But may we loving friends remain  for ever"  " Amen" cry'd the Captain so did all  And so the health went round the hall  And thus the famous Counterbrawl  was ended  But hunger now did vex them more  Than all their anger did before  They search'd i' th' room how far their store  extended  They want the meat which Blany stole  One finds a Herring in a hole  With dirt and dust black as a coal  and trodden  All under feet The next in post  Snaps up and feeds on what was lost  And looks not whether it were roast  or sodden  A third finds in another place  A piece of Ling in dirty case  And Mustard in his fellow's face  Another  Espies and finds a loaf of bread  A dish of butter all bespread  And stuck upon another's head  i' th' pother  Thus what they found contented some  At length the Keeper brings a broom  Meaning therewith to cleanse the room  with sweeping  But under table on the ground  Looking to sweep by chance he found  Lluellin faining to be sound  ly sleeping  He pull'd him out so swift by th' heels  As if his bum had run on wheels  And found his pocket stuff'd with Eels  his ********  Did plenty of provision bring  Somewhat it held of every thing  Smelts Flounders Rochets and of Ling  a broad piece  At this discovery each man round  Took equal share of what was found  Which afterwards they freely drown'd  in good drink  For of good beer there was good store  Till all were glad to give it o'er  For each man had enough and more  that

thus I end this famous Coun  terScuffle  TO THE READER  This Bacchanalian nightprize of the CounterScuffle being thus finished hath ever since frighted both prisoners and gaolers from coming into any room for fear of a second uproar So that the Counter for want of sweet garnishing and cleanly looking to is grown so nasly that no man by his goodwill will thrust his nose in at any of the grates nay  will rather go a mile about than come near it though to keep it sweet a great deal of mace is stuck upon every serjeant as if he were a capon in white broth Upon this slovenliness it is woefully haunted with Rats not such Rats as run up and down in Brewhouses sucking the new wort of strong beer so long and in such abundance that half the city is compelled to drink beer as small as water nor those Rats which are not mealymouth'd in Bakehouses where they gnaw so many batches of bread that a penny loaf wants sometimes three or four ounces in weight and then the honest Baker is blam'd and curs'd and perhaps innocently set in the pillory Neither are they those Rats which greaze their throats in Fallowchandlers shops where they nibble so much upon candles that not one pound in an hundred is ever full weight No these are no Rats with four legs but only two and though they have nests in a thousand places of London yet for the most part they run but into two Rattraps that is to say the Counters of Woodstreet and the Poultry and for that cause are called Counterrats  How caught how mouz'd and what they are  This picture lively doth declare  R S  THE COUNTERRAT  OF Knights and Squires

To garnish out a morning's feast  Each bit being salted with a jest  Scarce witty  These are not Rats that nibble cheese  Or challenge mouldy crusts for fees  And rather will their long tails leese

midnights Bedlam fits  But some being rid like jades with bits  Ran wildly  First about twelve the Countergates  Thunder'd with thumpingsDoors and grates  Reel'd at the pealwhen our prison mates  Up starting  Saw in the yard a frantic swarm  Crying "O my head neck sides leg arm"  Sore had the fight been but small harm  At parting  It was a Watch swearing "We bleed"  But 'twas their noses dropt indeed  " Masters quoth they we charge you take heed  Of him there  A ROARING RAT  That Royster us to our trumps has put  And run our Beadle through a gut  His Bilbo has from each man cut  A limb here"  They gone up comes the Bredabouncer  His tusks stiffstark like a brave Mounser  Of Turnbullpunks a staring trouncer  Some knew him  " Why here" quoth he "why zounds because  I'tugg'd with bears and par'd their paws  But sure I mawl'd Mr Constable's jaws  O slew him"  " All'sone" said one "Please you to bed Sir"  He swearing roar'd "I'm better bred Sir  scorn to rock my harnesshead Sir  In

then came in  Who to take measure out had been  And maudlindrunk to rince his sin  He weeps there  Weeps to be call'd a Rat being known  A man at leastso down being thrown  On a hard bench thus did he groan  In sorrow  " Brethren where am I" One replied  " In Woodstreet Counter""O my pride  Thou art ta'en down and I must hide  Tomorrow  A head that was not hid before  Wo worth him makes Manasses

goose which graz'd too hard  And for some stuffs which thou hast marr'd  With pressing"  We ask'd him why he was brought in  " Black threads of vice quoth he I spin"  And then again did thus begin  Condoling  " All are not Friars I see wear Cowls  Nor all in minc'd ruffs milkwhite souls  I should have talk'd thus when the bowls  Were trolling  But then to steal I held no harm  Lappets of drink to keep me warm  But linings wet hurt though they arm  Indeedla  O would my sheers might cut my thread  Why is this crosslegg'd mischief bred  Mending my want from heel to head  With speedla  Sorrow has made me dry no matter  Out of mine eyes will I drink water  No other ram my brains shall batter  To kill me  Roof touch no more wines French or Spanish  All drinks Papistical I banish  Out of my lips this phrase shall vanish  Boy fill me"  One bid him call for beer He said  " Oh no more beerbut reach me bread  By that I'll swearWould I were dead  And rotten  When I again swill aught but whey  Yet lest being cold my zeal decay  Hot waters shall not be one day  Forgotten"  AN OLD GREY RAT  This done he nods and quickly snores  And then afresh windfly the doors  An Usurer hedg'din with mad Whores  Came wallowing  As does a great ship on the seas  Set on by gallies for all these  Were Fishwives who had wine at ease  Been swallowing  And blown him up with pennypots  Of sack which fall to him by lots  Paid him at week's end by th' old Trots  For shillings  Each Monday lent them to buy skate  Crabs plaice and sprats at Billingsgate  Thus then they met and hold thus late  Their drillings  He rests in peace but is not dead  Yet is worm's meat in lousy bed  And lies like one wrapt up in lead  None stirr'd him  But all his oystermouths gap'd wide  Wine in their guts was at still tide  The Devil did so their rumps bestride  And spurr'd them  They flung and winc'd and kick'd down stairs  Themselves and stampt like Flanders mares  Hell is broke loose no Keeper dares  Approach them  For at that dog besauc'd in sack  They grind their teeth and curse him black  Crying out "'tis he does break their back  And broach them  So fast that all their gains boil out  Deep red to dye his filthy snout"  But that which flung these brands about  So hotly  'Gan now to quench them sleep does sound  Retreat dead drunk they all lie drown'd  In castup wine and on the ground  The shot lie  A BLACK RAT  Scarce was this hellish din allay'd  But drench'd in mire with drink bewray'd  New curried was brought in a jade  All mettle  An Ostrich that iron bars could eat  And strongbeer out of seacoals beat  His fifty cuffs did the watch fret  And nettle  This second Smug who had the staggers  This Vulcanist whose nails were daggers  This Smith so arm'd in ale he swaggers  At snoring  Though locktup yet set up his trade  Bolts hinges bars and grates he made  Fly which being heard the Jaylors paid  His roaring  They furnish'd him with iron enough  Neck hands and legs had armour tough  And stronger but more cold than buff  To guard him  How did they this None durst come near him  Like Tom of Bedlam did they fear him  All bringing cans to pledge them swear him  So snar'd him  Yet for all this he danc'd in 's shackles  And cried "T'other pot I want more tackles"  And thus till break of day it cackles  Laid having  The addleegg of his turn'd brains  In his iron nest of rusty chains  Which made him lose both sense of pains  And raving  A LONGTAILED RAT  The next that in our Littleease  A place of confinement for tuibulent apprentices N  Came to be bit with lice and fleas  Was a spruce knave like none of these  But sober  As the Strand Maypole  Where the NewChurch now stands Swift says  " I went in vain to look for Eupolis  " Down in The Strand just where the New Pole is"  N  he did go  In ruffHis thumb through ring did show  A Gentleman seal'd for he was no  Hoggrubber  It was a pettyfogging varlet  Whose back wore frieze but bum no scarlet  And was ta'en napping with his harlot  At noddy  But being hal'd in his hair he rent  And swore they all should dear repent  Their basenessfor no ill he meant  To her body  The Prisoners ask'd then what she was  Quoth he "My Clientone well to pass  Though here they impound me like an ass  I 'll serk them  I 'll make the beadle pluck in 's horn  He stirted at my nose in scorn  The Watch shall stink the Constable mourn  I 'll jerk them  Hang them if need be for they broke  Her housethat's burglarythe clock  Scarce counting twoand then they struck  O' th' mazzard  An action of strong Battery good  They made my nose

plaincase else Ployden  The case is alter'd Shall each Hoyden  Bar Law her course Dare rustic Royden  So venture"  A farthing candle burning by  By chance his railing rage did die  Yet to his breast Revenge did cry  So churning  His brains for Lawtricks how to sting them  And up to all the bars to bring them  He sate hardtwisting cords to wring them  till morning  No more of this light skipping verse  A dreary tale I now rehearse  LONG this brown study did no  last  But in at Countergates as fast  Throng'd all the watch again A noise  Of scraping men and squeaking boys  Straight fill'd the house The Twopenny ward  Leapt up and fell adancing hard  Out at the hole all thrust their heads  The Knightsward left their sevengroa  beds  The Master'sside hearing the din  Swore that the Devil was sure brought in  But when they heard they Fiddlers were  Some curs'd the noise some lent an ear  None curs'd but what went drunk to bed  Being then for want of drink half dead  Lock'd were the Fiddlers in a room  All cry'd "Strike up play Rogues Fumfum"  The minikin tinkled roar did the base  Then bawdy songs all sleep must chace  The men play'd heavily boys did whine  Not seeing meat money beer nor wine  Up such a laugh the prisoners took  That the beds danc'd and chambers shook  Nay the strange hubbub did so please  At prisonbace ran both lice and fleas  The rosin rubb'd off and catguts weary  We ask'd "How they who made men merry  Grew sad themselves and why like sprites  Fiddlers being strung to walk anights  Were they lock'd up"One then i' th' eye  Putting his finger told us why  Quoth he "Being met by a mad crew  In these poor cases up they drew  Our fiddles and like Tinkers swore  We should play them to The Blue Boar  Kept by mad Ralph  This mad landlord's house is

night was cold we fried  For such hot waters sod our brain  Like Daws in June we gap'd for rain  Strong were our coxcombs our legs weak  We nor our fiddles had wit to speak  The company then being fast asleep  And we paid foundly out did creep  Into the highway O sweet Moon  We but for thee had been undone  Yet though thy torch to us was lighted  We all might well have been indicted  For

fashionable vices of the present age drunkenness hath received a severe check amongst all ranks and particularly in higher life Not one of the abovementioned taverns now exists and every man must remember an amazing number in London more than there are at present N  we cry'd let 's go  At which one fell and then sworeNo  The Bars at Smithfield well we pass'd  For all the watch had run in haste  Arm'd with chalk'd bills wak'd by a cry  Of Whoredrops ta'en by th' enemy  From Cowcross stood those stoves not far  In which were enter'd men of war  Lowcountry Soldiers late come o'er  Each one goingin to press a Whore  Leaving them pressing on we trot  Through the Horsefair till we had got  Into the middle of Longlane  Where up the Devil does Brokers train  There down we fell and then 't fell out  Our leathern cases flew about  We fenc'd and foin'd and fought so long  That all our fiddles lay half unstrung  Their backs were broke and we o' th' ground  Swooning for grief they did not sound  Our noise brought up from Aldersgate  The rugged watch who before sate  Nodding at the Mermaid's door  Who with a guard of half a score  Seiz'd us and cry'd at going away  " Sad Lachrymae you there shall play"  This told the Prisoners laugh'd outright  And though the whole Ward had no light  Yet from their beds all skip and cry  " Scraper strike up we the Watch defy"  The Moon so bold was to look in  And saw some only in their skin  Naked as Cuckoos when June 's past  Some had long shirts down to their waist  Some wanted backparts some an arm  None wore a shirt could keep him warm  A French boy that sweeps chimnies wears  His patch'dup frock as white as theirs  Some on their heads no nightcaps wore  Some lapp'd their brows in hose all tore  They hobble out they frisk they sing  So long that crack'd was every string  By their rude horseplay altogether  Flinging their legs they car'd not whither  Such horrid noise such stinking smell  Cannot be heard nor felt in hell  Yet o'er they gave not till the sun  Arose then all to bed did run  GOODMORROW  The Rats into the trap that fell  This night were few the Constable  Belike did wink and would not see  For when the winds rise

DEAN OF NOTREDAME IN PARIS FOR THE ERECTING IN HIS CHOIR A THRONE FOR HIS GLORY AND THE ECLIPSING THE PRIDE OF AN IMPERIOUS USURPING CHANTER AN HEROIC POEM CONTAINING A TRUE HISTORY AND SHEWING THE FOLLY FOPPERY LUXURY LAZINESS PRIDE AMBITION AND CONTENTION OF THE ROMISH CLERGY  BY JOHN CROWNE  A dramatic writer whose performances both in comedy and tragedy were acted with applause though comedy seems to have been more peculiarly his talent Seventeen of his plays are enumerated by Jacob He was bred under his father an independent minister in Nova Scotia Being a man of some genius and impatient of the gloomy education he received in that country he resolved upon coming to England to try if he could not make his fortune by his wits When he first arrived here his necessities were extremely urgent and he was obliged to become a gentlemanusher to an old Independent lady But he soon grew as weary of that precise office as he was of the discipline of Nova Scotia He set himself therefore to writing and presently made himself so known to the court and town that he was nominated by Charles II to write "The Masque of Calypso" This nomination was procured him by the earl of Rochester it must not however be ascribed entirely to his merit but to some little spite in this lord who designed by that preference to mortify Mr Dryden Upon the breakingout of the two parties after the pretended discovery of the Popish plot the favour Crowne was in at court induced him to embrace the Tory party about which time he wrote a comedy called "The City Politicks" in order to satirize and expose the Whigs This comedy was by many intrigues of the partymen hindered from appearing upon the stage till the king himself laid his absolute commands on the lord chamberlain to have it acted immediately About the latter end of this reign Crowne tired out with writing and desirous to shelter himself from the resentment of many enemies he had made by his "City Politicks" ventured to address the king himself for an establishment in some office that might be a security to him for life The king answered  "he should be provided for"  but added  "that he would first see another comedy"  Mr Crowne endeavoured to excuse himself by telling the king that  "he plotted slowly and aukwardly"  His majesty replied that  "he would help him to a plot"  and so put into his hand the Spanish comedy called "Non pued esser" out of which Mr Crowne took the comedy of "Sir Courtly Nice" The play was just ready to appear to the world and Mr Crowne extremely delighted to think that he was going to be made happy the remaining part of his life by the performance of the king's promise But upon the last day of the rehearsal he met Underhill the player coming from the house as he was going to it upon which reprimanding him for neglecting so considerable a part as he had in the comedy and upon the last day too  "Lord Sir says Underhill we are all undone" "How says Crowne is the playhouse on fire" "The whole nation replies the player will quickly be so for the king is dead"  The king's death ruined Crowne who had now nothing but his wits to live on for the remaining part of his life It is not certain when he died but it is supposed to be somewhere about the year See Dennis's Letters vol I p and the Biographical Dictionary vo Mr Crowne was author of two other poems called "Pandion and Amphiginia" and "Daeneids" N    TO JOHN EARL OF MULGRAVE c  MY LORD  I HAVE long been ashamed to see so many of my writings march into the world and yet not one of them honoured by your lordship's patronage It is an easy matter for a troop to force themselves on ladies and  neutral gentlemen or nobility who will not arm but they must be men of some merit and gallantry who compel regard from a General Your lordship is as much above us in our own ways as you are in other respects and I give this manifest proof of it your fortune and most men believe your inclination fixes you on the top of ease and pleasure therefore you would never have written one line if it had cost you any pains yet have you performed masteries which we who  make poetry the whole business of our lives could never equal In your Essay on Poetry there appears to me a commanding genius standing on a rise overlooking the age you live in seeing all the writers in it marching below you and too often disorderly and you give us those orders which plainly shew Poetry attends on you you may do what you please with it but we compared with your lordship are but poor drudges to it that have oftener the will than the power to do well Your lordship has not only a perfect understanding of what is fit to pass in the world but you are of a severe temper which will not give your pass to any false sense the absence therefore of your name from my writings seems a silent charge against me of want of merit To remove that reproach I take this occasion to tell the world your lordship has approved of some of my writings and I have longed to make my brags of it but have been hindered either by the unkindness of fortune which has given me some blow and made me unfit to appear before you or by the kindness of some generous persons by which my writings have been in a manner mortgaged Though the law of the land does not reckon favour freely bestowed among debts the law of gratitude does whenever a man is obliged a judgement is entered against him In the late reign when your lordship graced the Lord Chamberlain's office you were pleased to shew me those regards which made me vain and I was very desirous to make it known to the world but the cloudiness of those times got I think into my head I did not write so well as I  have done formerly Now I venture before your lordship because I bring an acquaintance of yours I am sure you value Mr Boileau and a piece of his all men of sense have esteemed because it exposes to contempt men who are the antipodes to good sense priests who advance nonsense above reason make trifles of the most solemn matters and solemn things of trifles are idle in the great affairs of their calling and busy in impertinence By the few we have had amongst us of such kind of Churchmen we may guess the misery of the people who live in the Roman Church where there are scarce any other where the whole mass of priesthood is a heap of proud flesh and all the strength and nutriment of a nation goes to feed ecclesiastical corruption thanks be to God we are in a condition to make sport with them if ever they come amongst us they will spoil the jest And past dispute it is very fit to render men contemptible who endeavour to make Religion so We have had too many in our Church who have busied themselves and embroiled others about things which the French have had the understanding to know were only fit for a droll But now we have greater affairs on our hand We have not time to contend for modes in Religion when the Being of the Protestant Religion and indeed the English Nation lies at stake In a calm at sea men may have leisure to wrangle at Chess but if a storm arises the quarrel is at an end and the bishops knights rooks and pawns that bred it are left to shift for themselves I am well assured the Lutrin pleases your lordship but I may doubt of  my management of it for I treat it as an English privateer would do a French prize great part of it I sling away and I dash brew and disguise the rest as I think good I shall not value how the world censures me if I have the goodfortune to be approved of by your lordship and thought worthy of the title of my Lord  Your lordship's most humble and obliged servant  JOHN CROWNE  CANTO I  I SING of Angelsnot the heavenly Choir  Whom Peace and Truth and Harmony inspire  Hoarse brazen trumpetlike is my rough voice  Jarring ChurchAngels therefore are my choice  In mighty Paris two great spirits reign'd  Where one with ease could not be well contain'd  They strove and from them dreadful thunders broke  Which made great NotreDame both shake and smoke  And ere the almost falling Church could fix  Strange janglings made among Churchcandlesticks  Of all the Priests that wealthy Dome supply'd  With laziness with luxury and pride  None deeper sunk or firmlier remain'd  In peace and fat than he who o'er it reign'd  The Dean a solid Priest in flesh and bone  He like a sleepy Roller trundled on  Along all times and gather'd as he roll'd  A heavy heap of fat and clammy mold  He never knew when changes went or came  All Times Faiths Oaths appear'd to him the same  He had no palate but for Meats and Wine  In those he was a learn'd profound Divine  And to those studies kept so close and hard  To his Cathedral he paid small regard  Meanwhile a haughty melancholy sour  Old busy snarling Chanter steep'd in power  Chief of the Chanters there he was by right  But not contented with that noble height  Usurp'd the Dean's supremacy and more  Took high prerogatives unknown before  As scorning power only at secondhand  And he was terrible in his command  He made the Singers shake more than in song  This fierce Usurper rul'd in quiet long  Obey'd fear'd honour'd Churchaffairs went on  In a profound still current cross'd by none  At length the Dean from his long slumbers woke  Burst through his cloud and Church repose he broke  He saw his reverence and state were gone  And gallantly resolv'd to seize his own  Nay his prelatic legal pomp advance  On the intruding Chanter's arrogance  The great soul'd Chanter having proudly reign'd  Submission scorn'd and usurp'd state maintain'd  By his devotion to pomp power and pride  He won the zealous Canons to his side  Who skill'd in causes of that mighty weight  Lent him their aid by many a loud debate  So of old Pagan Prelates madly strove  The Moon's eclipse by noises to remove  Pagans beat dishes pans and platters hard  Our Priests no chattering in quotations spar'd  What Devil envious of Church repose  These fireballs into holy bosoms throws  And turns the Church to a disorder'd  out  How can such fury enter souls devout  Stand off Atheistic Wits and Scoffers vain  Do not my grave and solemn song prophane  Great NotreDame the high and stately scene  Of our ensuing story long had been  Adorn'd and blest with many a deep Divine  Not deep in arts but in downbeds and wine  Their great devotion doubly they exprest  In Church by pomp at home by heavenly rest  It grac'd their Master's service to maintain  In ease themselves his favorite Gentlemen  On their soft beds the morn they dos'd away  And left the Choir the drudgery to pray  And to rich lofty cushions to supply  Ther rooms in Church and raise God's honour high  God was well serv'd though Priests were never there  Bright Residentiaries the cushions were  The holy men eat drank and slept with zeal  All for Heaven's honour and the Church's weal  Kept from themselves all sacrilegious toil  True to their fat they were as Rhemes to oil  To anoint Gallic Kings an Angel brought  Much unctuous fat God sent his holy lot  Our pious Canons which to keep from waste  Careful they were not to preach pray or fast  Or only fast to give themselves a whet  So when they charg'd the rout was dreadful great  Sometimes soullulling Sermons from them stream'd  But ah so gently when they preach'd they seem'd  Like Halcyons brooding o'er a slumbering wave  To the Cathedral peaceful calms they gave  No croaking Preacher spoil'd with tedious din  Good Sunday dinners or sweet weekly Sin  No noise was there but of harmonious sound  Division there only in song was found  When horrid Discord rear'd her snaky head  To see who entertain'd a calm so dead  So loath'd by her Her Empire she survey'd  And found her will by millions was obey'd  Gladly she saw in each wellgovern'd state  The law with formal pomp support debate  But Churches highly pleas'd her ear and eye  She saw all Churches set her honour high  Yet our Cathedral only in Music loud  Lodg'd Peace in scorn of Discord and her crowd  Discord in rage perch'd on the lofty dome  And from her mouth she rain'd a poisonous foam  Which crack'd the glass martyr'd th' Apostles there  Then with a sigh which made trees shed their hair  Foul'd the Churchplate that all its splendors died  Like men in damps she vented thus her pride  " How dar'st thou proud Cathedral friendship shew  To Peace said she my known and vanquish'd foe  Which round the world I 've spurn'd Where has she rest  In one fair Realm she'as scarce one single breast  How often there in the same person fight  Whig Tory Williamite and Jacobite  Who have by turns the better of the fray  As French or Irish get or lose the day  Or as the hands of their good Moses rise  Well to reward or sharply to chastise  I 've made myself a barricado strong  Of stiff Nonswearers a most stubborn throng  Who by no art to yield can be compell'd  And grow more hard like trees by being fell'd  Nay ev'n some Swearers to advance my reign  The crown secur'd by law unfix again  Carve power by conquest which is carv'd by law  Some Swearers against these keen weapons draw  Between them Peace and Truth lead wretched lives  These fighters wound them with their carvingknives  Me above Church and State all nations set  And dares one Church neglect a power so great  Woes for thee this provoking crime provides  Streight her enormous figure Discord hides  With a square cap a surplice hood and gown  Nor from an old sour Canon could be known  Most true to Discord he wag'd endless war  With Peace in presses pulpits at the bar  All bars of civil and of canon laws  To law he went with or without a cause  With suits at law all his tithecorn he ground  Aye and himself and all his neighbours round  He would not spare his purse brain flesh or bone  To stir the clack of lawyers and his own  Discord and wrangling better to promote  He rail'd he sued he studied and he wrote  Toil'd unlike God from light he darkness spun  Worlds by this Antimaker were undone  He preach'd for malice in the pulpit boil'd  Till dinners and devotions were both spoil'd  When his thin flock by winter winds were flea'd  To gaul the sore he'd a long service read  Then far above his hour in pulpit rail  Then tack an Altarservice to the tail  Till all their meat was burnt and noses raw  Some to provoke to give him food for Law  Dissent assent his dues detain or pay  Though not to Heaven to Court 's the certain way  By this good guide all they were sure to find  Who not conform'd in all things to his mind  If pious reverence they forgot to shew  To altars and his person by a bow  And did not service so exactly mark  To start at all responses with the Clerk  To pour their voices in the muttering throng  And help to push the murmuring stream along  If they nick'd not their times to kneel and rise  And on these faults his spectacles were spies  But woe to Hugonots remote or nigh  From his hot busy zeal and watchful eye  Proctors and Paritours had wealthy spoil  And Constables an everlasting toil  Baptismal water sacramental wine  Cast away much of the reformers coin  Basons and bowls not blest with legal forms  Were sure to meet with most confounding storms  Discord had chose this Canon for her own  And therefore mark  d his brow with many a frown  His lean cheeks wrangled all the wrinkles clash'd  Whene'er they met and deep his visage slash'd  Therefore his figure Discord wisely wore  For none could fit her better please her more  CANTO II  TO the Dean's palace stormy Discord steer'd  And finds the bulkly Prelate sepulcher'd  In an alcove and down in hopes at last  Of joyful resurrection to repast  In his fair spreading cheeks the Church's charge  Had rais'd a garden beautiful and large  And in two stories built his goodly chin  To let these run to ruin were a sin  The holy man did no expences spare  To keep them faithfully in good repair  And every part about him fat and sound  For they were Church demesnes and holy ground  Rich curtains gave his slumbers strong defence  Against Da  's sacrilegious violence  Soft pillows had his cheeks and let no air  Approach to harm the lively roses there  For Youth's Springflowers in his dull Autumn grew  Those checks possessing which were Age's due  All things in order were for dinner laid  When the great Goddess her proud entry made  Such exact order highly pleas'd her eye  She knew the Church by scrupulous decency  In all the joys of silence ease and pride  And with a breakfast strongly fortified  The Dean attending dinner slumbering lay  When thus the Goddess drove his rest away  " Wake quickly Dean she said or wake no more  A Chanter haughtily usurps thy power  Shines in the Choir with thy prelatic grace  And awes it with the same commanding face  All bows of Singers are to him addrest  All Congregations by his mouth are blest  He graces all the Saints high solemn days  When to oblige them he in person prays  Shortly he'll youth confirm and priests ordain  And scarce to thee thy rochet shall remain  Renounce thy prelacy or thy repose  Thy fortune dooms thee one of them to lose"  This said she breathes into him through his ear  The spirit of a common Barretter  He wakes and yawns and with halfopen'd eyes  Gives the dire fiend his blessing as he flies  Then like a raging bull with hornet stung  Around the chamber his fat body flung  Chid maids and lacqueys why he did not know  And before dinner to the Choir will go  But his wise Steward much allay'd his rage  By counsels seasonable calm and sage  " What fury's this said he has seiz'd your mind  And hurries you to Church before you've din'd  Oft have you left the work of saving fouls  To sport some hours at tables chess or bowls  But for the Church ne'er dinner left till now  The dresserboard is ready for the blow  Your cook now foams and so does your pottáge  With your judicious palate to engage  And if your roastmeats you compel to stay  Sir they will weep their gravy all away  Your hautgousts now most vigorous and strong  Will sicken if in cold they tarry long  And never be reviv'd by second heat  Sir if you go you'll murder all your meat  It is not Lent say 'twere it seems a waste  Of holiness in holy men to fast  Your tongues and pens support Church rites and laws  What need y' engage your bowels in the cause  Sure 'twas the Church's motherly intent  Lent should keep Prelates and not Prelates Lent  Religiously support your high degree  Do not by toil debase your dignity"  This said he wisely cover'd all the cloth  With crowds of dishes and a flood of broth  Much on the pious Dean this vision wrought  His cloth a while St Peter's sheet he thought  A treat let down from Heaven in a dream  Till his pleas'd nostrils felt th' inviting steam  Then fiercely he apply'd himself to eat  And found it more than visionary meat  Fast o'er the tongue he turn'd his morsels all  Like morningcollects  t a festival  Himself he almost choak'd but not his wroth  He champ'd his words and meat confusedly both  He skipt from dish to dish he knew not why  No order minded nor sweet decency  The Steward thought his Master's end was near  He knew not creatures which he lov'd so dear  And in great sorrow was about to run  To summon friends but Fame that work had done  They scattering came like troops of daunted cranes  When the proud pigmy a recruit obtains  The visit rais'd the Prelate from despair  Chac'd from his visage the late furious air  So pleas'd he was with the respect they shew'd  That he vouchsaf'd to rise nay more he bow'd  Commanded the Westphaliaham again  Fill'd wine himself to honour the good men  Drank first and largely the example pleas'd  And strait a flaggon of its load was eas'd  He kindly mov'd them then to take a part  Of what remain'd and of a fair desert  The table clear out burst his inward pain  " Dear friends said he by whose support I reign  Myself your charitable work I own  Which the proud Chanter thinks to tumble down  At least by interposing in my rights  To make me useless and blind up my lights  To him do all Churchofficers repair  At his command the Sexton rings to prayer  Chapters are held at his usurping call  What need of Deans if Chanters can do all"  But then tears stopt the current of his talk  His loving Steward empower'd his tongue to walk  With chearful wine when Bovrude bending low  With heavy age with trembling steps and slow  Enter'd the room The Church had us'd his pains  In four successive Deans voluptuous reigns  None in Churchcustoms was so skill'd as he  He was a living true Churchhistory  His knowledge rais'd him from a Sexton poor  To the high trust of all Churchgarniture  Great office Robes are often half the Dean  This rules those Robes ordains them to be clean  One in this office half a Dean ordains  O'er half a Dean as Dean he proudly reigns  He has in part an archprelatic power  He 's of one college parcelvisitour  At first approach the Reverend Sage espies  The Dean's demolish'd pride and groveling eyes  Guessing the cause he smiling tow'rds him mov'd  And fatherlike his childish grief reprov'd  " For shame said he let the poor Chanter weep  Your rights and empire study you to keep  Hark to the counsel Heaven does now inspire  Where the proud Chanter overlooks the Choir  With frowning arrogance some ages past  The Church was shaded with an engine vast  Desk throne or pulpit call it what you please  At once it serv'd devotion pomp and ease  There thron'd in glory I have known a Dean  In vestments rich on velvet cushions lean  Prayerbooks embost with gold before him shone  Which drew all eyes upon them but his own  A worm stol'n from a grave the Chanter seem'd  Just visible enough to be contemn'd  Time fate or fiends malicious men or all  For they 're all foes to good conspir'd its fall  Malicious men we think by secret art  Gave it a sickness in some noble part  That never visited nor minded well  One morn it yawn'd and down to ruin fell  And to its worth th' ungrateful Choir unjust  Laid it in dark forgetfulness and dust  What honour'd once the Choir has now forlorn  Lain thirty winters languishing in scorn  Three of us fit for such a great affair  Will perriwig'd in Night's dishevel'd hair  Steal to the pulpit in its mournful room  And gloriously reward its martyrdom  If once to murmur the proud Chanter dare  The wretch with forty biting actions tear  Since not in Learning be in Law renown'd  Shew a Churchspirit the whole Church confound  Ere quit a tittle of your sacred right  Let Laymen pray Prelates are known by might  Your dazzling right divine dart at your foe  Then to the Church in all Churchsplendor go  And there browbeat th' usurper to the ground  Then to outbrave him disperse blessings round  To blast his pride and shew yourself supreme  Bless all the Congregation nay bless him"  The counsel seem'd to admiration wise  The Dean in ravishments with lifted eyes  Heaven's inspiration most devoutly blest  But strait a new reflection struck his breast  " I now have in the Choir a seat said he  Cloath'd with rich cushions crown'd with canopy  On what pretence can I erect this throne"  Boyrude reply'd "A most religious one  Sermons to hear" Th' assembly trembled all  With horror at the sound fanatical  The Prelate hotly fir'd profanely swore  And almost call'd for an Inquisitor  " Dar'st thou said he name sermons in my ear  I 'll be no Dean ere buy the place so dear  I 'll rather combat with wild beasts like Paul  Or like Isaiah be saw'd once for all  Than weakly be with torturing sermons saw'd  Postpone my meals and be with fasting gnaw'd  Nay more myself into the toil they 'll fetch  And I myself shall be oblig'd to preach"  " Make potent Prelates preach the Sage replies  Pray by what rule' you are not tongues but eyes  Our eyes guide all our limbs yet keep their ease  Labour becomes not highest dignities  Sectaries like Jews with wanderings are perplext  Doom'd all their lives to rove from text to text  Die in that wilderness and ne'er possess  Rome's blessed holy land of laziness  A land that flows with honey milk and gains  At Heaven's sole cost and not the owner's pains  Of this you 've more than a dim Pisgah sight  And ease is your inviolable right  Make Canons preach and while the work is done  Let your austere grave presence lash them on  By their dull saws no doubt you would be pain'd  But you 'll with sweet revenge be entertain'd  They 've uncanonical rebellious tongues  And from them you 've receiv'd a thousand wrongs  Like jades in waterworks Sir make them sweat  Till from them penetential drops you get  Then you 'll soon have revenge and reverence both  Soon at your feet they 'll fall to compass sloth"  Into a loud applause th' assembly broke  And thought man never with more wisdom spoke  All start of fame to have the greatest share  But the wise Dean reduc'd them as they were  " All things in Church by order must be done  Said he that rears and fixes every throne  None shall approach this work but those whom Fate  Shall by a lot ordain and consecrate"  Thirty selected names are writ with haste  And in the bottom of a bonnet cast  Fairly to draw the billets they employ  Rosycheek'd Will that pretty Singingboy  His head new poll'd his face and linen clean  Though no Saint'sday for much he pleas'd the Dean  The Prelate all partiality disclaims  Having thrice blest as often shakes the names  Will draws and Trole is the first name that comes  Birds promis'd good which freely peck'd their crumbs  Sure no ill augury could now be read  This redbeak'd bird from liquor never fled  A pleasing murmur in the throng was rais'd  And Fortune's choice by every one was prais'd  Will to his office does again repair  And draws a name most fatal to the fair  Of a young Singingman whose charms 'tis said  Had been the death of many a Chambermaid  Nay his keen mounting darts reach'd lofty game  Threatened high ranks with loss of life or fame  Whatever beauty ogled him was lost  And soon became a strumpet or a ghost  Yet to the dangerous snare they ventur'd all  His silver pipe was a true ladycall  Which both Churchpews and Playhouse boxes cram'd  Entic'd the Fair both to be sav'd and damn'd  But oh that lady gain'd the height of bliss  Whom he in private taught to sing and kiss  Long the soft sex did for the youth contend  Some took their eyes some money for their friend  Some had him all and some had modest shares  Some clear'd their tones some gave a crack to theirs  To him his fortune gave a second choice  And now they go to ask Fate's last advice  Their names and panting hearts are tost again  Each fearing Fate his person should disdain  Honest old Verger what sincere delight  Shook thy dry corpse when thy name rose in sight  Thy yellow cheeks turn'd red and with a shout  Thou backwards gav'st a spring in spite of gout  Now loyal true Church hearts who for Church weal  Had an unquenchable religious zeal  Much prais'd Fate's choice of men for Church affairs  And wish'd all realms as able ministers  All kings as deep in sight as Fate had shewn  In chusing men to serve the Church and Throne  On the design now all prepare to go  And in a murmuring stream away they flow  To the Dean's cellar where they rent the arch  With drunken songs and sounded oft a march  The Prelate calm'd resum'd his lost repose  And now till supper laid him down to dose  CANTO III  NOW Night was in the middle of her reign  Great was her pomp and spacious was her train  From her large throne of jet she saw the proud  High towers of Paris scorn an humble cloud  Ravens and all the prophets of the air  Nightly to dormitories near repair  Amongst the rest for twenty winters foul  In a dark cave a Sibyl call'd an Owl  Secur'd herself from Day's oppressing light  And fled abroad to prophesy at Night  Of great disasters she has early sense  Is an impartial true intelligence  All sects believe her though she joins with none  The Schismatick flies all communion  Night for her healing touch Nature enthrones  She often cures both crazy minds and bones  Kings fall'n with care below e'en common men  She reanoints and makes them kings again  Day wears but Night repairs nay makes mankind  The only labour to her reign assign'd  Therefore this Ethiop with Day divides  The rule of time half through her empire slides  Angry to see her reign profan'd with toil  She posted to suppress the noisy broil  And the bold authors for the great affair  She chose this Owl her premier minister  And call'd her out her black queen's voice she knew  To her retinue joyfully she flew  Both swiftly through th' august Cathedral past  And found the prison of the engine vast  It lay neglected in a desert room  Night plac'd her bird deep in its dusty womb  Now Trole and Minnum two great chiefs elect  Left the Dean's vault and the slow Verger check'd  He was as vigorous as they in mind  But age and gout detain'd him far behind  Besides th' old tortoise carried on his back  Of necessary tools a boisterous pack  As hammer chissels mallet saw and nails  Under whose weight his wasted vigour fails  The warriors force through Night's affrightful shade  Then valiantly the high proud dome invade  First they ascend to the magnific porch  Which stor'd the valued learning of the Church  The Verger stopp'd the troop whilst with the dint  Of steel he cut the veins of stubborn flint  And forc'd from thence a spark the infant bright  As soon as born begot another light  Which proves to them a kind of midnight sun  By whose direction boldly they go on  Th' unfolding gates upon the troop let loose  Detested shades like floods through opening sluice  Like a bold caravan the stream they stem  The horrors and the solitude contemn  So on in wilds where never was a road  And reach at length the pulpit's dark abode  Their wonders on the fall'n machine they feast  Like birds upon the carcass of a beast  " How now said Minnum come we here to gaze"  And then ambitious to engross the praise  With a stiff threatening arm and bending back  He singly made a desperate attack  Ere half his force the engine had receiv'd  Astonishing and scarce to be believ'd  A horrid voice out of the pulpit flew  Th' old Verger from his back his burthen threw  The fire from Trole's flaming visage stray'd  Only in his nose as in a socket play'd  Pale Minnum like a lily hung his head  With his lost mistress wish'd himself in bed  But fearing shame he put false courage on  Seem'd bolder now more danger might be won  The frightful dangerous engine shook once more  With greater resolution than before  The angry Owl once more depriv'd of ease  Rushes abroad with greater menaces  Scattering a storm of wind and dust about  Which put their candle and their courage out  Their trembling knees could not their bodies bear  Their nerves were weaker than their staring hair  In wild confusion they slunk all away  Like truants by their whipster catch'd at play  Discord rag'd at their foil and in despight  Of their base fear will force them to the fight  In Boyrude's wither'd figure she appears  Aged but worn with wrangling more than years  Wrinkled but malice half the cyphers made  And claim to half his wasted visage laid  Her bending trunk she with a staff supports  And hastes to find her warriors' dark resorts  With broken voice and hoarse with frequent brawl  She cries "Where are you fled ye cowards all  Think you because your odious heads ye hide  Your infamy more odious is not spy'd  Come out and shew the reason of your fear"  Stung with reproof with boldness they appear  Proud of th' encounter and prepar'd to boast  For all of them believ'd the Owl a Ghost  Minnum was fix'd in the opinion strong  His charms had kill'd a Sempstress fair and young  Her heart was crush'd between his voice and face  The kingdom had not such a dangerous place  His voice had fix'd her in the fatal snare  She often came to gaze on him at prayer  And when his eye was from the book releas'd  He glances shot which pierc'd her tender breast  At length alas she perish'd in the fray  Her ruin therefore heavy on him lay  What shape could more exactly fit her soul  Than that of an unlovely bashful Owl  Whom the wing'd Chanters drive out of their sight  And make her live in melancholy night  With these conceits they swelling came and cram'd  Minnum for th' Owl a doleful speech had fram'd  He said "We saw a Ghost or Goblin foul"  Reply'd the Goddess "Goblin a poor Owl  Drives you from glory by base childish fears  This Owl has been my neighbour thirty years  Near my own house she every evening makes  And sends abroad her nightly Almanacks  Fear you a foolish timorous Owl's grimace  How durst y' encounter then a Judge's face  Board Lawyers without sees as I have done  And to myself immortal glory won  Judges from me could not protect the bar  Where spite of them my deeds recorded are  Oh Sirs the Church produc'd brave spirits then  A Sexton was as surly as a Dean  Bore wrongs as proudly and forgave as few  The least of us would a whole Chapter sue  But the old world grows barren by degrees  And breeds no more such gallant souls as these  However imitate their virtues great  Let not an Owl compel you to retreat  Think what dishonour on yourselves you throw  How insolent you'll make the Chanter grow  From texts he cannot borrow such control  As from the shameful story of the Owl  The thought o' th' Owl will ride you night and day  Dispirit you though ye be ne'er so gay  Untune your voices when you'd sing your best  Russle your plumes when you are neatly drest  Your surplices wips cravats set with care  E'en women will regard you less than prayer  The pews will be neglected by degrees  And the old Verger lose his Sunday fees  I hear a murmur say your spirits rise  And I see Churchlike fury in your eyes  Away to honour gather laurels fast  With present bravery hide dishonour past"  This said the warlike Goddess took her flight  And mounting streak'd the air with tracks of light  Which fir'd our champions hearts The Howlard fled  A generous contempt succeeded dread  Th' affront receiv'd from the vile saucy foe  On th' engine was reveng'd by many a blow  In mournful tones the pitying organ moan'd  And the whole sympathizing temple groan'd  Ah when this spacious wooden horse was rear'd  If thou oh Chanter hadst the treason heard  Thou in defence of ecclesiastic pride  Like a true Church Apostle would'st have dy'd  Rather great Martyr been than Chanter small  And in red letters shine or not at all  But sleep thou feed'st does with thy foes combine  And hug thee whilst they compass their design  For now a lofty Ecclesiastic Throne  Buries thy Bench where thou so long hast shone  CANTO IV  NOW do the cocks begin their morning brawl  And drowsy Chanters to their mattins call  Their Chief was troubled with a frightful dream  Which made him sweat and waken with a scream  His trembling Valets on his second cries  Forsake their warm enticing down and rise  But wakeful Gerot reach'd his Master first  An humble Valet but a Verger curst  He kept the Choir on the sinister side  He crouch'd at home but there he shew'd his pride  Mean were his common customers for pews  So in their humble bows he took his dues  Said he "What humour drives your rest away  Will you to Church when it is scarcely day  Sleep on your business is to take your ease  Let vulgar Chanters earn their salaries"  " Friend said the Chanter trembling faint and pale  Your mirth would die if you knew what I ail  Insult not o'er me but prepare to hear  Th' amazing cause of my surprizing fear  When sleep had twice upon my eyes bestow'd  Of drowsy poppies a freshgather'd load  I dreamt I fill'd my lofty Seat in prayer  Triumphing o'er the Minor Chanters there  Absolving chanting taking humble bows  Giving the blessing all with frowning brows  When a great Dragon with jaws dreadful wide  Souz'd on my Bench and swallow'd all my pride"  Then rage tonguety'd him Gerot laughing loud  Said "Dreams were fumes from illconcocted food  Cooks with ill sauce could every night bestow  On childish fancies such a puppetshow"  The sour old man could ne'er with mirth agree  But now abhorr'd his illtim'd raillery  Forbad him speaking and from bed he flings  Gerot to calm him his rich habit brings  Which very little could his mind sustain  For if his Desk be hid all those were vain  But yet their offer'd grace he will not slight  He rush'd into his gown and surplice white  But above all he will not leave behind  His spacious scarlet hood with tabby lin'd  His haughty heart would break if he should lack  That proof of learning to adorn his back  With his best bonnet then he grac'd his brow  Sole mark of learning his white head could shew  His purple gloves he never fail'd to wear  When he would honour much himself and prayer  And marching now in battle to engage  Omitted no illustrious equipage  Then much beyond the weakness of his years  Push'd on and earliest in the Choir appears  But oh what spite and fury fir'd his blood  When on his Bench he saw the Pulpit stood  " Oh Gerot see said he the Dragon see  Which broke my sleep and now will swallow me  Oh faithful Dream thou too much truth hast shown  The Dean is an ingenious tyrant grown  By this machine does wittily contrive  To send me to infernal shades alive  Nothing but God will ever see me here  Dark shadows will expunge my character  Ere such a horrible affront I'll bear  I'll quit my office and the Church forswear  I'll give my vain superfluous Chantings o'er  And tire the ears of God and Man no more  I'll never toil that Deans may glory win  Nor see that Choir where I shall ne'er be seen  'Tis time enough to go to shades when dead  I'll now have light" Then his old arms he spread  With fury strong and shook the wondrous frame  When th' Organist and the Clockmender came  His faithful friends The vision struck them wan  With trembling hands they held th' old venturous man  Said they "The work's too weighty for us all  By a full Chapter let the Monster fall  In open day 'twill your great party shew  Strengthen yourself and terrify the foe  " Right" said the Chanter "go by noise or force  The sleeping Canons from their beds divorce"  The Champions trembled when beyond their thought  Their counsel on themselves such danger brought  " Oh moderate your anger Sir said they  Awaken rich fat Canons before day  Men doubly buried both in flesh and down  Th' attempt is rare the deed was never known  Starv'd Monks a larum in their bosoms keep  Hunger a watchful enemy to Sleep  Their thinworn wheels are soon in motion set  But who can stir a Canon mir'd in fat"  " Deceitful cowards th' old testy man reply'd  You fain your terror of the Dean would hide  A hundred times I've seen you croüching stand  With servile necks beneath his blessing hand  The work good Gerot shall by us be done  Our friends for once shall shame the loitering sun"  Cunning old Gerot knew the Canons well  Spar'd his worn lungs rung the great masterbell  Which like the heavy Dean but serv'd for state  And almost broke the Church with needless weight  Th' unchrist'ned bell with sacrilegious roar  From his strong camp the God of slumbers tore  Broke open all the holy Canons eyes  And made the Devil of noise and tumult rise  Some believ'd thunder broke into the room  Others half fear'd it was the day of doom  Some Priests less scar'd thought 'twas a dying knell  Some keenly hungry hop'd 'twas Pancakebell  The sound with different sense fill'd every head  Like a dark text wondrous confusion bred  So when to batter down a hundred walls  The thund'ring Lewis leaves the fair Versailles  To the young Spring not valuing her delights  And with spread banners all the world affrights  Danow to th' Euxine hastes his march to shun  Swift Rhine in great commotion hurrieson  Brussels for bursting bombs looks every hour  And Sodomlike to feel a fiery shower  Rich skirted Tagus creeps far under ground  And hides much treasure there in vaults profound  Amphibious Holland plunges deep in waves  Buries itself alive in watery graves  So under blankets the priests duck'd their heads  Sought a warm easy burial in their beds  Vexatious Gerot knew their temper well  With potent words he seconded the bell  " Ho breakfast waits" the cunning Verger cries  At that angelic summons all arise  In expectations of divine delights  All look their cloaths but none their appetites  For they were ready ere their gowns were on  Headlong undrest to the great hall they run  But 'stead of breakfast met a mournful tale  Told by the Chanter with great fury pale  Who as a pestilence were in his breath  Struck mighty hunger with a sudden death  Everard a painful abstinence abhorr'd  And bad the Verger cover strait the board  To that once savoury motion no man spoke  At length learn'd Allen the deep silence broke  He only of all the Priests our Church obey'd  Had not his Latin smother'd and o'erlaid  Others by wealth to dulness did advance  And with the Church's coin brought ignorance  But he had wander'd from that practis'd rule  And was as learn'd as when he came from school  His Roman tongue there gave him mighty power  There he was almost Roman Emperor  None in his presence durst lay claim to parts  For if they did his Latin stabb'd their hearts  This tyrant yet was their defence and grace  Latin was such a terror to the place  All other Canons fled at first alarms  Of men approaching with such dreadful arms  But noble Allen scorn'd his head to hide  And sturdy shocks of Latin durst abide  Most learnedly equipp'd th' accomplish'd man  Having first cough'd his wise harangue began  " Some Huguenots our curst eternal foes  Planted this here to batter our repose  In some Church History they 've read I fear  Canons once preach'd and Deans sat here to hear  I range in volumes not to poach for art  But to meet Latin which delights my heart  Let us all study with what speed we may  And shew ourselves as deeply learn'd as they  About this Pulpit then let 's quickly found  All learned men in these great things profound"  Th' unlook'dfor counsel all th' assembly scar'd  But made an earthquake in fat Everard  Who shaking with astonishment and rage  " How I said he turn schoolboy in my age  Do thou look pale and wither o'er a book  I ne'er so much as on the Bible look  I only study when our rents are due  When leases fall and tenants should renew  Books I abhor they fill the Church with Schisms  Much mischief we have had from Syllogisms  If to Religion you would converts make  Burn Books and Men say I and use a stake  I will not vex my head my arm alone  Shall without Latin throw this Pulpit down  I care not what Heretic Rascals say  What troubles me I 'll throw out of my way  So let's prepare for the renown'd design  And when accomplish'd plentifully dine"  No sooner the word Dinner pass'd their ears  Than up their stomachs rose down fell their fears  But then the Chanter none more bold and great  Exclaim'd "This Tub too long has made us sweat  Do Deans fear dust must they be cas'd like clocks  Would they like sentries awe us from a box  In our Churchpillar is some rottenness spread  To hide himself he would be wainscoted  My vengeance on this soppery I'll throw  And an hour's fasting on the work bestow  This done at once we 'll break our fast and dine  And two fair meals with both their portions join"  By this inspir'd the haughty Champions go  With an audacious zeal to charge the foe  The walls vain aid to the poor Engine lent  The nails in vain their iron fingers bent  The Champions vanquish'd all resistance round  The batter'd Engine fell with many a wound  Antichrist never had such dreadful blows  From mighty Priests who were his bitter foes  For as this Pulpit was he 's wondrous high  A great Usurper of Churchvanity  Therefore have many rail'd at him aloud  He will let no man but himself be proud  Now the Dean's State of late so high and great  Once

of princely virtues here pursue  At once both copy and admire your fame  And all their different aims unite in You  One bloody sieges and feign'd camp designs  And fancied schemes of future actions draws  And early in imaginary times  Defends his Country's and his Prince's cause  Others the milder arts of Phoebus chuse  And to smooth numbers form their tuneful tongue  From You begin to You direct their Muse  The Subject and the Patron of their song  Illustrious Guests Jointpartners in our love  Protect these arts which by your influence live  Those arts which we with loyal zeal improve  To You return the vigour they receive  Whilst Ormond by undaunted courage led  Regions unknown and distant foes alarms  We Ormond's care to early duty bred  Learn here to aid your councils and your arms  III TO THE QUEEN AT SUPPER  BY MR FINCH  Heneage grandson to the first earl of Nottingham His father was created baron Guernsey March and earl of Aylesford Oct The speaker of these verses died earl of Aylesford June and was grandfather to the present earl N    WITH love though rude we crowd this hallow'd place  And clog that triumph which we mean to grace  To view the Queen that frees us from alarms  Secures our quiet and directs our arms  England before its ruin'd trade deplor'd  A mourning victor and disputed lord  Now mouldering fleets in Gallic harbours lie  While British ships their double world defy  Our Muses hear the battles from afar  And sing the triumphs and enjoy the war  This now but soon the quivering spear they'll wield  And lead the shouting squadrons to the field  They'll serve that Princess whom before they sung  Defend that Queen beneath whose eye they sprung  So spreading oaks from lovely Windsor born  Shall shelter Britain which they now adorn  With swelling sails o'er distant seas they'll go  And guard that Goddefs by whose care they grow  IV TO THE QUEEN GOING TO BED  SPOKEN BY MR PULTENEY  This was very likely to have been the late lord Bath and I am sorry that it cannot be ascertained N    MADAM once more th' obsequious Muse  With zeal and just ambition fir'd  Her grateful homage here renews  In numbers by Yourself inspir'd  And late her willing duty shows  To guard you to your safe repose  Within this silent humble cell  Secure the gifts of sleep receive  No factions here or discords dwell  To break that rest the Muses give  Here daily cares help to increase  Not interrupt our mighty ease  These walls more happy now possest  Of the most fair and shining Court  Not in the Muses but their Guest  Theirs and the Muses' chief support  So Delphos was the bless'd abode  Of Phoebus' Priests and of the God  May Heaven its sacred charge defend  May every Grace and every Muse  Round You with watchful care attend  And balms of gentle sleep infuse  Such as the virtuous only know  Kind as the blessings You bestow  CONTENTS OF VOLUME III  THE Eagle and the Robin By Dr King Page  Robin Red Breast with the Beasts an Old Cat's
