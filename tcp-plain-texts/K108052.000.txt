 AN ANSWER To Some OBJECTIONS OF A  Moderate ENQUIRER  Robert Snow  WE received a Paper subscribed by thee and directed to the Church or People of God called  Quakers  c Which Paper contains some  Objections  which thou sayst thou hast heard spoken against us and wherein thou desirest to be satisfied To which we say It is no strange Thing to us to be spoken against by the World's Teachers that being no more than befel the People of God in the First breaking forth of Christianity in the World Of whom it was said  Acts    As concerning this Sect we know that every where it is spoken against  But we are willing to endeavour thy Satisfaction by Answering the  Objections  The First is  You own no Day either the First or Last as a Sabbath to the Gentiles  Answer  The Sabbath which was the seventh or last Day of the Week was given to the  Jews Ex    Rom  Not to the  Gentiles Psal    Rom  and was to last as other typical Ordinances  were  untill the time of Reformation Heb    till the Seed should come Gal    which was Christ ver    the Lord of the Sabbath Mat    who in the Fulness of time did blot out the Handwriting of Ordinances  c  and took it out the Way nailing it to his Cross Col  From whence the Apostle thus infers  Let no man therefore judge you  the Saints and faithful Brethren  Col    in Meat or in Drink or in respect of an Holy Day or of the New Moon or of the Sabbath Days Col  which says he  are a Shadow of things to come but the Body is of Christ ver  Thus was that  Sabbath  which was given by God to his People the  Jews  ended and taken away by Christ before the  Gentiles  were called to be his People And as for the  First Day  of the Week we do not read in the Holy Scriptures that it is called the  SabbathDay  or commanded to be kept and observed for a  Sabbath  as the  Seventh Day  had been But on the contrary we find the Apostle  Paul  writing to the  Romans  who were  Gentiles  though not without some mixture of believing  Jews  amongst them as appears  Acts  says  One Man esteems one Day above another  there was the believing  Jew    Another esteemeth every Day alike  there was the believing  Gentile  Well what then Doth he commend the Former of these and condemn the Latter No but he says  Let every Man be fully perswaded in his own Mind  Rom And in the  th    th  and  th  verses disswades them from judging one another about the Observing or not observing a Day as well as about the Eating or not eating of Meats and seems to lay no more Stress upon the one than the other And if the Drift of the Apostle's discourse there be heedfully minded it will appear that as he sets him who believed he might eat all Things with him that esteemed every Day a like and him that esteemed one Day above another with him that eat Herbs So he imputes the Weakness to the Latter  ver  and sets himself on  the other side saying  We then that are strong ought to bear the Infirmities of the Weak  Chap And he tells the  Galatians  which though a  Gentile Chureh  had also  Jewish  Believers in it  I am afraid of you lest I have bestowed upon you Labour in vain  Gal Why so  Ye observe Days and Months and Times and Years  says he  ver  So jealous was the Apostle lest any that had been gathered from outward Observations and from a shadowy State should imbondage themselves again in Shadows and fall short of injoying the Substance which is the true Gospel  Rest that remains to the People of God  Heb Which in the next verse is described to be Their  Ceasing  from their  own Works as God did from his Into which Rest we  saith the Apostle  that have helieved do enter ver  and in the verse he presses others to labour to enter into that Rest Now when the Apostle says There Remains a Rest it plainly implies that the former Rest the outward Sabbatical Rest did not remain but was passed away and gone Nor is it reasonable to suppose that the Rest here mentioned which is said to Remain to the People of God was an outward Bodily Resting from outward Bodily Labour on what soever Day both as that would be but to change one Type or Figure for another and as the entring into this Rest is set forth in the Text as a Matter of Labour and Difficulty  ver  as it is indeed yet blessed be the Lord he hath enabled some that have believed in his Name and subjected to his Power to enter into this Rest in this his Day and many are pressing after it as the true abiding GospelRest which the Legal Sabbath was but a Type or Shadow of  The OBJECTION is  You deny the Scriptures to be any Rule for Man or Woman to walk by so as to direct them to the saving of their Souls  Answer  In this we are misrepre  ented We sincerely own love and regard the Holy Scriptures believing  with the Apostle that  they were given by Inspiration of God and are profitable for Doctrine for Reproof for Correction for Instruction in Righteousness that the Man of God may be perfect throughly furnished unto all good Works    Tim  and that  they are able to make wise unto Salvation through Faith that is in Christ Jesus ver  And great benefit and delight we sind in them reading them in the openings of that Divine Spirit by which they were given forth We are so far from denying them to be  any  Rule  c  that we acknowledge them to contain  many  excellent Rules Precepts Doctrines and Instructions directing Man and Woman how to walk that they may obtain the Salvation of their Souls Yet we do not say as some have done that the Scriptures are the  only  Rule or the  chief  and  principal  Rule because we dare not give the Honour and Office of the Holy Spirit unto the Scriptures For the Scriptures themselves declare That  it is the Office of the Holy Spirit to guide Believers into all Truth John  And indeed the true Meaning and Benefit of the Scriptures themselves is not attained to in the Reading of them unless the Spirit that gave them forth do open them and unseal the Mysteries contained in them So that the Holy Spirit is greater than the Scriptures and therefore we cannot but give the chief Place unto him For he is able to manifest himself unto Man and to lead man into the Way of Salvation either with and by the Scriptures or without them as he pleases But the Scriptures cannot do that without the Operation of the Holy Spirit Justly therefore do we affirm the Spirit of God to be the  Chief  Rule and yet acknowledge the Holy Scriptures to be a true Rule and proper Instrument in the Hand of the Spirit to direct Men and Women how they ought to walk to obtain Salvation to their Souls as the Spirit of the Lord makes use of the Scriptures to that End  The d OBJECTION is  You deny the Resurrection of this mortal Body that this Mortal shall not put on Immortality  Answer  In this also we are misrepresented We do not deny but own the Resurrection of the Dead Believing with the Apostle that  This Corruptible shall put on Incorruption and this Mortal shall put on Immortality  Cor And indeed if we did not believe this we might well say as he did  If in this Life only we have Hope in Christ we were of all Men most miserable  ver  And Why stand we in jeopardy every Hour  ver But the Lord knows and we have openly and sincerely declared that we believe and own the Resurrection of the Dead according as the Holy Scriptures testify concerning it Which say  Thou sowest not that Body that shall be but bare Grain  c  But God giveth it a Body as it hath pleased him and to every Seed his own Body  ver  It is sown a natural Body it is raised a Spiritual Body  ver the reason of which follows  ver  namely  That Flesh and Blood cannot inherit the Kingdom of God neither doth Corruption inherit Incorruption  And as we firmly believe this So we take this to be sufficient without being so curiously inquisitive as he who would needs ask  How are the Dead raised up and with what Body do they come  ver and was called  Fool  for his Pains  ver    The th OBJECTION is  You suffer Women to be your Teachers that were forbid by the Apostle for he says that they should keep silence  Answer  The  Jews  of old had a strong Persuasion grounded upon some misunderstood Places of Scripture that the Salvation of God was confined to them and belonged not at all to the  Gentiles  And this Opinion had prevailed so far upon them that even those of them that received the Gospel could not easily shake it off In so much that after  Peter  had been with  Cornelius  the  Centurion  and was come  back again to  Jerusalem  he was called before the Church for it  they that were of the Circumcision contending with him  and  saying Thou went'st in to Men uncircumcised and did'st eat with them  Act To whom having related the Occasion and Particulars of that Matter he concludes his Defence thus  For as much then as God gave them the like Gift as he did unto us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ what was I that I could withstand God  ver And in the next verse it follows  when they heard these Things they held their Peace and glorisied God  c This Answer which the Apostle gave in that Case may be suitable we think for us to give in this Case to such as from some misunderstood Places of Scripture are offended at us for Suffering Women to speak in our Assemblies  viz  For as much as God hath given them the like Gift as he did unto us who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ what are we that we should withstand God God by his Servant  Joel  in the Time of the Law had made this Promise with Relation to the Times of the Gospel  viz And it shall come to pass afterwards or in the last Days as  Peter  repeats it  Act  that I will pour out my Spirit upon all Flesh and your Sons and your Daughters shall prophecy your old Men shall dream Dreams your young Men shall see Visions And also upon the Servants and upon the Handmaids in these Days will I pour out my Spirit  Joel And they shall prophecy adds  Peter  Act Here was no Distinction of Sex made But this Promise of  pouring out the Spirit  and of  prophesying  thereby is extended as expresly and fully to the Daughters as to the Sons to the Handmaids as to the Servants And this the Apostle  Peter  doth expresly apply to that great  pouring forth of the Spirit upon the Church  at the Pentecost immediately after Christ's Ascension saying  This is that which was spoken by the Prophet Joel  Acts Now at that great and eminent  pouring forth of the Spirit it appears the Women were not excluded For when after the Ascention the Apostles and Disciples were returned from Mount  Olivet  to  Jerusalem  it is said  These all continued with one Accord in Prayer and Supplication with the Women and Mary the Mother of Jesus  c Acts The Number of the Names together being about an hundred and twenty ver  And when the Day of Pentecost was fully come they were  all  with one Accord in one Place  Chap and in vers it is said the cloven  Tongues sate upon  each  of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other Tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance  ver Here was no Distinction made no shutting out the Women but all were together all received the Gift of the Spirit and began to  Speake with other Tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance  Nor was it thus only at that time and upon that extraordinary Occasion but continued in the Church afterwards For we read  that Philip the Evangelist had four Daughters that did Prophesy  Acts  Phebe  a Woman is recommended by the Apostle  Paul  to the Church at  Rome  not only as a  Sister  but as a  Servant of the Church  Rom  Priscilla  a Woman is called by the same Apostle  My Helper  or Fellow Labourer  in Christ Jesus  ver  Tryphena  and  Tryphosa  two godly Women are saluted by him as  Labourers in the Lord  And of the beloved  Persis  another Holy Woman he testifies that  she laboured much in the Lord  ver The same Apostle in his Epistle to the  Philippians  says  I intreat thee also true Yoke Fellow help those Women which laboured with me in the Gospel  Phil Which is the Phrase by which the Apostle doth frequently express his own Ministry And which he particularly applies to  Timotheus  whom he calls  Our Brother and Minister of God and our Fellow Labourer in the Gospel of Christ  Thes Which is a clear Evidence  that those Women that had received the Gift of Prophesy did minister therein to the Edification of the Church as well as the Men Nay the Apostle  Paul  in that very Epistle wherein he is thought by some to discountenance  Womens Preaching  doth give Directions for the Manner of their  Preaching  or  Prophesying  viz  That they should do it with their Heads covered  For having first said  Every Man praying or prophesying having his Head covered dishonoureth his Head  Cor He adds  But every Woman that Prayeth or Prophesyeth with her Head uncovered dishonoured her Head  ver This puts it out of doubt that Womens  Praying  and  Prophesying  in the Church was at that Time both lawful and usual as well as Mens  Now that by  Prophesying  here is meant  Preaching  not barely foretelling Things to come may not only be inferred from the use of the same Word in the verse foregoing where being spoken of Men it is granted on all Hands to intend  Preaching  and from thence the general practice of  Mens Preaching uncovered  is defended but may also fairly be concluded from the explanation the Apostle gives of it in Chap ver where he tells that Church in general  We may all Prophesy one by one that  all  may  learn Which manifests that by  Prophesying  he intended  Preaching  or  Teaching  that being the proper way or means of  Learning  And in the Beginning of that Chapter where he prefers  Prophesying  before  Speaking whith Tongues  ver and he says  He that Prophesyeth Speaketh unto Men to Edification and Exhortation and Comfort  ver And  He that Prophesyeth Edifieth the Church  ver which plainly shew that by  Prophesying  he meant  Preaching  or  Teaching  that being the proper means or way of Edifying And therefore seeing he not only allowed Women to  Prophecy  but directed and advised them how they should perform it  Chap  and that in  this Place  Prophesying  and  Preaching  appear to be one and the same Thing it is unreasonable to suppose he denied them the Liberty of  Preaching  being gifted and called thereunto As for those Words of his Cor  Let your Women keep silence in the Churches sor it is not permitted unto them to speak but to be under Obedience as also saith the Law  Observe first that those Words  as also saith the Law  relate only to the Womens being under  Obedience  not to their keeping  silence  in the Church For that was never enjoyned them in the Law but they were permitted to speak in the Congregation And both  Miriam  who was a Prophetess did sing the Triumphs of the Lord in the publick Congregation  Ex  And  Deborah  who was a Prophetess did recount the noble Acts of the Lord and celebrate his Praises in a Triumphant Song  Judges  Read also what  Hanna  spake in the House of the Lord in  Shiloh    Sam  And  Anna  who was a Prophetess did not only give thanks unto the Lord but spake of Christ to all them that looked for Redemption in  Jerusalem Luke  This was direct  Preaching  and that  in the Temple  So that the Women were not enjoyned  silence  under the Law but were permitted to  Speak  In the next Place consider what Speaking it was that was forbidden by the Apostle in that Place  Cor  which from his following Words will appear to be not a Speaking of the Words of Life and Salvation not a Speaking as the Spirit of God gives utterance but speaking disorderly asking Questions unseasonably and out of place not speaking for the Edification of Others but speaking for their own Information only for he immediately adds  If they will learn any Thing let them ask their Husbands at home  ver These Words  learn  and  ask  plainly shew that the Speaking here condemned was not a Speaking the  Doctrines  of the Gospel for the Edification of the  Church but  asking Questions  for their own Satisfaction which they might have done at home but not there therefore he adds  For it is a Shame for Women to speak in the Church  And so indeed it was in such a disorderly manner as they speake to interrogate or Catechise either the Minister or their Husbands openly in the Church to ask the Meaning of this or call for an Explanation of that which might look like a throwing off their Obedience to their Husband and must needs Occasion Disorders and Confusion in the Assembly which we may perceive was the Thing that troubled the Apostle and which he laboured to reform for he said before  God is not the Author of Confusion but of Peace  ver and he concludes the Chapter with this Admonition  Let all Things be done decently and in Order  So that it was the disorderly Practice of some Women in that Church which he reproves who it seems when any Thing was spoken which they did not understand would interpose and  ask Questions  for information Sake which was uncomely in them offensive and troublesome to the Congregation This sort of  Speaking  was not permitted them but was a Shame to them and from which they ought to have kept silence  in the Church  And  if they will learn any Thing  says he  let them ask their Husbands at home  Of like import are those other Words of the same Apostle to  Timothy  and probably on the same Occasion  Let the Woman  says he  learn in silence with all Subjection But I suffer not a Woman to teach nor to usurp Authority over the Man but to be in silence    Tim  For hence it appears still that the Occasion they took of speaking was under pretence of  learning  wherein they took an undue Liberty to  ask Questions  as if they would catechise or teach their Husbands But though the Apostle would not suffer such sort of Speaking in the Church as might give Occasion to any to think that the Women did cast off the Obedience  they owed and did usurp Authority over their Husbands nor after such a manner as might breed Confusion in the Congregation for he was so watchful against that that he enjoyns the Man to be silent in that Case as well as the Woman  If any Man  says he  speak in an unknown Tonguelet one interpret But if there be no Interpreter let him keep silence in the Church  Cor Yet we have before shewed that he allowed of  Women prophesying  and that by  Prophesying  he meant  Preaching  We have also given many Instances of Women that laboured in the Work of the Gospel in that Day and could from a living and sure experience multiply Instances of many Women in this Day whom the Lord hath committed the Word of Life and Reconciliation unto and who in the quickning Power and Vertue thereof have sounded forth the same to the awakening of many that were a sleep in Sin and turning of many  from Darkness to Light and from the Power of Satan to God  who are now become living Seals of their Ministry Neither would this seem so strange as it doth to some did they duly consider That  God is no Respecter of Persons  But that as in the  old Creation  Male and Female were Created in the Image of God So in the  new Creation  Male and Female are all one in Christ Jesus  Gal  But as they that contended with  Peter  for conversing with the  Gentiles  when they had heard his Defence held their Peace and glorified God saying  Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted Repentance unto Life Acts  So we hope they that have taken Offence at us for suffering Women to  speak  in the Church when they shall have duly and impartially weighed what is herein offered for their Satisfaction will hold their Peace as to any Opposition thereunto and glorify God saying  Then hath God committed unto Women also the Word of Reconciliation  The fifth Objection is  You are a People that have gained Health to your Immortal Souls and are sure of Heaven when the Scriptures say that  the Righteous Man falls seven times a Day  and the Apostle  Paul  said that  Sin was still actually in him  Answer  We do not desire to boast of any Attainments Yet we cannot but confess to the Glory of God and the Praise of his Holy Name that His saving Health hath appeared in this his Day and we through his Mercy have tasted of it Christ the Saviour is manifested in Spirit and we through Grace have felt the healing Virtue of his Divine Life and Power Through the tender Mercy of our God the Dayspring from on high hath visited us and hath given Light to us that sate in Darkness and in the Shadow of Death and hath guided our Feet into the way of Peace and hath helped us to make our Calling and Election sure As for the Scripture thou mentionest we do not find that the Scripture saith  The Righteous Man falls seven times a Day  but in  Prov  we find it thus written  For a Just Man falleth seven times and riseth up again but the Wicked shall fall into Mischief  And as the Verse before shews the Occasion of these Words where it is said  Lay not wait O wicked Man against the Dwelling of the Righteous spoil not his resting place  So the latter Part of this th Verse  but the wicked shall fall into Mischief  implies that the just Man doth not fall as the wicked Man does  into Mischief  And seeing all Sin is Mischief it seems as if the Fall here spoken of the just Man were not a  falling into Sin  but into some outward Calamity or Exercise However the Place speaks nothing of  daily  or  continual falling  Nor do we remember that  Paul  doth use that very Expression concerning himself  viz That Sin was still actually in him  though we know that he doth in divers places run through as it were and open the various States and Travels  of the Soul in some of which he cried out  O wretched Man that I am who shall deliver  c But he rested not there but quickly breaks forth into a Rejoycing and cries out  I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord  Rom And then in the next Chapter having said  There is no Condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the Flesh but after the Spirit  he says expresly concerning himself  For the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death  ver And again  Thanks be to God which giveth us the Victory through our Lord Jesus Christ  Cor This  Victory  we press after this  Freedom from the Law of Sin and Death  we labour and travel to attain unto by a Subjection through Divine Assistance to the  Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus  The th Objection is  Why your Teachers perswade you that all other People are in a barren and desolate Condition and are out of Christ  Answer  Our Teachers do not perswade us so nor do we Judge so of all other People For we our selves were gathered out of various Professions States and Conditions and some of us who had been seeking after the Lord in other Professions can remember that before we were thus gathered to this divine Principle of  Light  which the Lord hath set up in this his Day as an Ensign for the Nations to be gathered unto and to walk in we were not wholly barren and desolate but had at Seasons some touches and tasts of the Vertue of that hidden Life which we were then Strangers to the Lord having regard to the Sincerity of our Hearts and answering in some measure the Breathings of our Souls to him so far at least as to cherish and keep alive those good Desires which were begotten in us and to beget in us a greater Hunger and Thirst after him And it is not hard to us to believe that  so it may be with others at this Day who have an Integrity to the Lord though not acquainted with his Outgoings and Manifestations of himself in this Dispensation of  Light  and  Life  And both our Prayers to God the Father in and through his Son Jesus Christ and our Labour and Endeavours in the Openings of his Love and Life in our Hearts are that all these in whatsoever Profession may be drawn off from all the dry Hills and barren Mountains and gathered into the true Sheepfold For we remember our Saviour said  Other Sheep I have which are not of this Fold them also I must bring and they shall hear my Voice and there shall be one Fold and one Shepherd  Joh The Lord grant that none of these may mistake his Voice or disobey it  The last Objection is  You deny all outward Ordinances as  Baptism  and the  Six Principles  that were taught to the first primitive Christians  Answer  The Dispensation of the Law was  outward  and the Ordinances appertaining to that Dispensation were  outward  also But the Dispensation of the Gospel is spiritual and  inward  and the Ordinances appertaining to this Dispensation are of a spiritual Nature The  Baptism with Water  was  John  's and came up under the Dispensation of the Law nor did properly belong to the Gospel Dispensation though for a time by Condescention continued as Circumcision and some other Legal Rites were And this was that Baptism which  Paul  says Christ sent him not to baptize with  Cor  But the  Baptism of Christ  the true GospelBaptism that by which the true Believer is baptised into Jesus Christ  Rom  and buried with him into Death ver  The one Baptism  Eph  is the Baptism with the Holy Ghost and with Fire  and is plainly distinguished from the Baptism with Water both by  John  to whom the WaterBaptism  belonged and by Christ to whom the SpiritBaptism belonged For  John  said  I indeed baptize you with Water unto Repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose Shoos I am not worthy to bear He shall Baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with Fire  Mat And Christ as  Luke  records a little before his Ascention said  John truly baptized with Water but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence  Acts which was the Promise of the Father  ver  delivered by Christ to his Apostles and Disciples just before his parting from them  Luke  Let it therefore be fairly considered That the Dispensation of the Gospel is  Spiritual  and therefore the Ordinances belonging to it should be so too That in  Mat  From which place the Commission for WaterBaptism is usually fetched there is no mention of Water That Baptism with Water is no where in Scripture called Christ's Baptism That Baptism with Water is frequently called  John's Baptism  That the Baptism with the Holy Ghost is called  Christ's Baptism  That the Apostle  Paul  acknowledges but  One Baptism  Eph which cannot be supposed to be that with  Water  since then he must exclude the Baptism of the  Spirit  That the Apostle  Peter  speaking of the Baptism that saves says expresly  It is not the putting away the Filth of the Flesh  Pet which it is the Property of Water to do as if he had said  The Baptism which now saves us is not WaterBaptism  That Baptism with Water is no where expresly commanded in Scripture as it would doubtless have been had it been intended by Christ for a Gospel Ordinance That tho' it was sometimes used after Christ's Ascention yet that cannot authorize the use of it now any more than of Circumcision and other Legal Ordinances which in Condescention to the Weakness of Believers in that Day were also used  after Christ's Ascention yet are confest by all not to be in force now For  John  as himself said was to  decrease  Joh which related to his Ministry or Dispensation not to his Person Now a  Decreasing  implies a growing less or wearing away by degrees not all on a suddain or at once and therefore no wonder if his WaterBaptism was continued for a time even after Christ's Baptism of the Holy Spirit took place But as Christ's Baptism was to  increase  so  John  's was to  decrease  till Christ's came to be  all in all  and  John  's Water Baptism wholly to give place Let these things we say be duly weighed and we hope we shall not be blamed for leaving the Baptism of  John  and cleaving to the Baptism of  Christ  As for the  Six Principles  thou mentionest seeing thou hast not declared what they are it cannot be expected we should speak to them at this time But we recommend to thee that holy divine Principle of  Light  wherewith Christ  lighteth every Man that cometh into the World  Joh  In which Light the Nations of them that are saved shall walk  Rev And we heartily desire thou mayst walk therein  T E  AN ACCOUNT OF TYTHES in General  THE only Command from God that we read of in Holy Scripture for the Payment of Tythes was given by  Moses  to the People of  Israel  in the time of the  Levitical Law  Then God first reserved to himself the Tythe of the Land of Canaan  Lev  Which he did for this reason that intending to take the Tribe of  Levi  more peculiarly into his Service as he did  Numb  in stead of or in exchange for all the First born of  Israel  ver and and Chap ver Having before reserved and appropriated the First born to himself  Ex  he might bestow those Tythes on the  Levites  for and towards the Maintenance of that whole Tribe as a Reward for their Service in the Tabernacle of the Congregation  Numb  and in lieu of and Compensation for their Part or Share of and in the Land of  Canaan  which thereupon they were expresly cut off from ver  Now although it was grounded on a Principle of Moral Justice and Equity that the  Levites  thus engaged in a continual Attendance on a publick Service and shut out from their Share in the Inheritance of the promised Land should receive a sufficient  Maintenance from them for whom they performed that Service and who enjoyed their Part of the Land Yet the ascertaining of the  Quot a  of that Maintenance to the exact proportion of a  Tenth Part  of the Increase of the Land was not grounded on Moral Justice but had its dependence on the Ceremonial Law adapted and limited to the Polity of that Dispensation and People only And that it might not be extended beyond its appointed Time and Bounds it pleased the Divine Wisdom to subject it to such Ceremonial Circumstances as plainly rank it amongst those carnal Ordinances Rites or Ceremonies which were imposed but  till the Time of Reformation  Spoken of  Heb  For as God appointed the  Levites  to be offered for a  WaveOffering  by  Moses  in the Name and on the behalf of the Children of  Israel  when he said to  Moses Thou shalt bring the Levites to the Tabernacle of the Congregation and thou shalt gather the whole Assembly of the Children of Israel together And thou shalt bring the Levites before the Lord and the Children of Israel shall put their Hands upon the Levites And Aaron shall offer  in the Margin  Wave the Levites before the Lord for an Offering  in the Margin  WaveOffering of the Children of Israel that they may execute the Service of the Lord  Num So the Tythes which were assigned for the Maintenance of the  Levites  were to be first offered by the People as an  HeaveOffering  unto the Lord  The Tythes of the Children of Israel which they offer as an HeaveOffering unto the Lord I have given to the Levites  c  Numb  And even the Tythes of those Tythes which the  Levites  were to yield unto the  Priests  were to be offered by the  Levites  as an  HeaveOffering  to the Lord before the  Priests  might have them  Thus speak unto the Levites  said God to Moses  and say unto them When ye take of the Children of Israel the Tythe which I have given you from them for your Inheritance Then ye shall offer up an HeaveOffering of it for the Lord even  a tenth Part of the Tythe And this your HeaveOffering shall be reckoned unto you as though it were the Corn of the threshing Floor  c  Thus ye also shall offer an HeaveOffering unto the Lord of all your Tythes which ye receive of the Children of Israel And ye shall give there of the Lord's HeaveOffering to Aaron the Priest  ver This makes it evident beyond doubting that the Tythes which were given by the People to the  Levites  and by the  Levites  to the  Priests  under the Law had their Dependence on the Ceremonial Law as that Priesthood had And were to stand no longer than that Law and that Priesthood stood Which was but till  Shiloh  came and by the Offering of himself once for all had put an end to all the shadowy Offerings under that Law  This the Author of the Epistle to the  Hebrews  did so well understand that he positively declared that  the Levitical Priesthood being changed there was made of Necessity a Change also of the Law  of that Law by which that Priesthood and the Maintenance of it had stood See  Heb  And 'tis also evident from Scripture and Primitive Antiquity that neither the Apostles themselves nor for some ages after them any of the Christians did meddle with or at all concern themselves about Tythes But let them totally fall as they did the other abrogated Part  viz  Offerings  c  and of the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  But after that the Mystery of Iniquity which in the Apostles time began to work  Thes  had wrought to that Degree amongst some Christians and had drawn them so far from the Purity and Simplicity of the Gospel as to form and model the Church in many things by and according to the  Jewish  Pattern amongst other Ceremonial Parts of the  Jewish  Religion which had been abolished by the Coming and Death of Christ Tythes were preached up again about the latter end of the fourth Century and beginning of the fifth by some at first under the Notion  of Alms and Charity because part of the Tythes under the Levitical Law were appointed for the Maintenance of the Fatherless the Widow and the Stranger  Deut  And by others as then still due by the Mosaic Law which had required them to be paid to the Levitical Priesthood Which Plea afterwards Corruptions increasing in the Church and in those especially who were called the  ChurchMen  or  Clergy  more and more prevailing the Payment of Tythes was reintroduced as due by those Levitical Laws which had been given to the  Israelites  of old And upon that Bottom Tythes have stood been claimed and the Claim defended unto this Day  Now not only he that thus claims and receives Tythes but he that consents to and complies with such Claim by paying Tythes thus brought in and thus claimed doth thereby implicitly and vertually at least deny that Christ has put an End to the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  and consequently that he is come and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind And that this may appear as plain as is possible I shall draw the Matter into an Argument thus  To uphold any Thing as still in force which was to be taken away and cease at and by the Death of Christ is to deny that Christ is come and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind  But to receive or pay Tythes now is to uphold a Thing as still in force which was to be taken away and cease at and by the Death of Christ  Therefore to receive or pay Tythes now is to deny that Christ is come and hath suffered in his Flesh for Mankind  The  Major  must be granted and the  Minor  I thus prove  Whatsoever was  a part  of the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  was to be taken away and cease at and by the Death of Christ  But Tythes were a part of the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  Therefore Tythes were to be taken away and cease at and by the Death of Christ  The  Major  here again is unexceptionable And the  Minor  is thus proved  Every  HeaveOffering  among the  Jews  was  a Part  of the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  But Tythes were an  HeaveOffering  among the  Jews  Num  Therefore Tythes were  a Part  of the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  By this it appears that without regard had of the Person to whom or the Use for which Tythes are paid the paying of Tythes as well as the receiving them being  a Part  of the abrogated Ceremonial Law of  Moses  imports a denyal of the Coming and Death of  Christ  Hence it is that Tythes have been and are commonly called  Antichristian  or  against Christ  And hence hath risen that saying often used not only by our antient Friends but by some of the Martyrs long before  viz He that pays Tythes doth thereby deny that Christ is come in the Flesh  That Conclusion could not have been drawn from the paying of Tythes to a wrong Ministry or for a wrong use only though such Payment be evil Nor could any thing justify that Inference but the Consideration that Tythes depending on the Ceremonial Law of  Moses  which must of Necessity and in course fall and cease when Christ suffered the paying of Tythes carries in it a supposal that that Law is not yet ceased but is still in force and consequently that Christ whose Death must needs have ended it is not yet come nor has yet suffered in his Flesh for Mankind  That other Objection not less weighty than common against paying Tythes to the  Clergy  so called  viz  The unlawfulness of upholding a false Ministry to perform a false Worship being it self so  clear and plain that it needs no illustration I shall in this Discourse no further meddle with than to observe in my way how far it may affect those Tythes also which the  Impropriators  claim Wherefore having premised what is said before concerning Tythes in general to what Hand or for what Use soever paid let us now inquire into those Tythes which are called  Impropriate  Of Impropriate  TYTHES  THAT these Tythes which are claimed by the  Impropriators  are of the same Nature and stand originally on the same Root and Ground on which the other Tythes stand which are claimed and exacted by the  Priests  is evident from hence that they were all heretofore these as well as those claimed by and paid to some or other of the  Romish Clergy  or their Appendices the Religious Orders so called and upon the same Foot That is These  Impropriate Tythes  were paid to those Religious Orders or Houses as being due to God by vertue of the  LeviticLaw  as well as the other Tythes were paid to the  ParishPriests  on the same supposed Right from the same Law But how these Ththes came to those Religious Houses first and how afterwards from them to the  Impropriators  is next to be inquired  Until the  Lateran Council  so named because it was holden in the  Pope's  Palace at  Rome  called the  Lateran  in the Year It was in the choice of every Man to give his Tythes to what Church he pleased so he gave them to some Church And even after that Council the  Popes  as Heads of that Church by their dispencing Power did give leave to such as would sue and pay for it to give their Tythes from the  ParishPriest  to such Order of Religious People whether  Monks Friers  or  Nuns  as they were best affected to By which means the  ParishPriests  called  Seculars    and those of the several Religious Orders called by a general Title  Regulars  being left to scramble as they could for maintenance the  Regulars mendicant Fryers  and others swarming in all Places and pretending at least to greater Sanctity and Austerity of Life than the  ParishPriests  prevailed with the People either living or dying to give not only very considerable Estates in Lands but also the Tythes of other Lands and of whole Parishes from the  ParishPriests  to their Religious Houses or Convents  The Tythes or Parsonages so given were then called  Appropriations  because they were appropriated to this that or the other Religious House or Convent And I have read that there were in  England  about Parsonages thus appropriated And as Tythes were then held to be  due to God and holy Church  and those Religious Orders were reputed a part of that Church So the Tythes as well as the Lands thus given them were continued to them and possessed by them till that general Storm arose in K  Henry  his time which overturned those Religious Houses and Orders together And here by the way it may be noted That while those Religious Houses stood a great part of the Lands which had been given to them were by Papal Authority exempted from paying Tythes Whence it is that many of those Estates which had belonged to those Religious Houses remain discharged from the Burden of Tythes still  As Tythes were set up here on the Authority of the  Levitic Law  and in imitation of the  Jewish Practice  consonant to that Law So while those Religious Houses stood and the  Pope  's Power prevailed here not only the  Seculars  or  ParishPriests  but all those  Regulars  who received Tythes were bound to pay the  Tenths  out of the Tythes they received to the Head of their Church the  Pope  as the  Levites  under the Ceremonial Law were required to do to the Priests  But after that K  Hen  upon a Quarrel between  the  Pope  and him about his Divorce from his first Queen  Catharine  which he earnestly desired and the  Pope  would not grant fell off from the  Pope  though not from  Popery  For after that he retained the most pernicious Doctrines of the  Romish Church  contained in the six Articles and burnt some for denying them he threw off the  Pope  's Supremacy here and assumed it to himself declaring himself and being declared first by the  Clergy  in their  Convocation  and soon after by  Lords  and  Commons  in  Parliament The only Supream Head in Earth of the Church of England  This was done by the Statute of  Hen  c And therein it is enacted  'That the King his Heirs and Successors Kings of this Realm shall be taken accepted and reputed the only Supream Head in Earth of the Church of  England  And shall have and enjoy annexed and united to the Imperial Crown of this Realm as well the Title and Stile thereof as all Honours Dignities Praeeminences Jurisdictions Privileges Authorities Immunities Profits and Commodities to the said Dignity of Supream Head of the same Church belonging and appertaining And shall have full Power and Authority from time to time to Visit Repress Redress Reform Order Correct Restrain and Amend all such Errors Heresies Abuses Offences Contempts and Enormities whatsoever they be which by any manner of Spiritual Authority and Jurisdiction ought or may lawfully be reformed repressed ordered redressed corrected restrained or amended'  c  By which it is evident the Intention of the  Parliament  then was to transfer confer and settle unto and upon King  Henry  all the Powers Profits and Privileges which had been before supposed to be in or belong to or had been enjoyed or exercised by the  Pope  while he was received as  Supream Head of the Church  And therefore as the  Pope  while he retained the  Supremacy  here had the first Fruits which are the Profits of every Spiritual or Ecclesiastical Living for one Year upon the advancing of any Ecclesiastical Person to such a Living and also the  Tenths  that is the  tenth Part  of all the Tythes So these two Revenues as appendant to that  Supremacy  followed it being settled on the King in the same Session of Parliament wherein the Supremacy was vested in him The Words of the Statute  H  c relating to the  first Fruits  are these  'That for the more surety of Continuance and Augmentation of his High ness Royal Estate being not only now recognized as he always indeed hath heretofore been the only Supream Head in Earth next and immediatly under God of the Church of  England  but also their most assured and undoubted natural Soveraign Liege Lord and King  c  It may therefore be enacted and ordained by  c  That the King's Highness his Heirs and Successors Kings of this Realm shall have and enjoy from time to time to endure for ever of every such Person and Persons which at any time after the first Day of  January  next shall be nominated elected perfected presented collated or by any other means appointed to have any ArchBishoprick Abbacy Monastery Priory Colledge Hospital Archdeaconry Deanry Provostship Prebend Parsonage Vicarage Chauntry FreeChappel or other Dignity Benefice Office or Promotion Spiritual within this Realm or elswhere within any of the King's Dominions of what Name Nature or Quality soever they be or to whose Foundation Patronage or Gift soever they belong the FirstFruits Revenues and Profits for one Year of every such ArchBishoprick Bishoprick Abby Monastery PrioryParsonage Vicarage'  c  Then after Provisions made for finding out the value of those Spiritual Livings and for paying receiving and recovering those  FirstFruits    the Settlement of the  Tenths  that other part of the  Pope  's Revenue upon the King follows in the same Statute in these Words  'And over this be it enacted by Authority aforesaid that the Kings Majesty his Heirs and Successors Kings of this Realm for more Augmentation and Maintenance of the Royal Estate of his Imperial Crown and Dignity of Supream Head of the Church of  England  shall yearly have take enjoy and receive united and knit to his Imperial Crown for ever one yearly Rent or Pension amounting to the value of the Tenth Part of all the Revenues Rents Farms Tythes Offerings Emoluments and of all other Profits as well called Spiritual as Temporal now appertaining or belonging or that hereafter shall belong to any

FreeChappel or other Benefice or Promotion Spiritual of what Name Nature or Quality soever they be within any Diocess of this Realm or in Wales'  c  And so goes on to direct the time place and manner of Payment of these Tenths with the Penalty for nonpayment  Thus were these two great Pillars of  Papal Supremacy First Fruits  and  Tenths  transferr'd from the  Pope  the old Head to the King the new Head of the Church to support and maintain that Headship in him as they had done before in the  Pope  Which Ecclesiastical Headship the King was no sooner possessed of than he began to exercise it amongst those Religious Orders Suppressing as  Herbert  in his Life p relates the  Observant Fryers  at  Greenwich Canterbury Richmond  and other Places and substituting the  Augustines  in their  Places  'Which he did says  Herbert  there for the finding out how his People would take his Design of putting down Religious Houses'  To which he proceeded the next Year beginning with the lesser Sort and suppressing all those Monasteries Priories and other Religious Houses of  Monks Canons  and  Nuns  which had not in Lands Tenements Rents Tythes Portions and other Hereditaments above the clear yearly Value of two hundred Pounds By which means of those Religious Houses being dissolved a Revenue of above thirty thousand Pounds a Year beside an hundred thousand Pounds in Money raised yb sale at low Rates of the Goods and Chattels of those Houses a Sum not small in that Age came to the King for support of his Ecclesiastical Supremacy  The Statute which countenanced this Proceeding is the of  Hen  cap And a new Court called  the Court of Augmentations  was then erected and settled by Parliament for receiving and ordering these new accessional Revenue the Act for which in our printed Statute Books is set before that for the Suppression of those lesser Monasteries But though that for Suppressing those Monasteries be by an  Hysterosis  set after that for establishing the  Court of Augmentations  Yet it must have been made before it For it is recited in it  In that Statute  Hen  for suppressing those smaller Monasteries mention is made of Monasteries Abbies and Priores which within one Year before the making of that Statute had been given and granted to the King by any Abbot Prior Abbess or Prioress under their ConventSeal or that otherwise had been suppressed or dissolved All which were by that Statute confirmed to the King and to all those unto whom the King either then before had conveyed or then a  ter should convey any Part or Parts thereof 'To hold to them in like Manner  Form and Conditions as the Abbots Priors Abbesses Prioresses' and other chief Governors of any religious Houses which had the same might or ought to have had if they had not been suppressed For upon the King's falling as was noted before upon the Observant  Fryers  at  Greenwich  and other places some of the more considerate of the  Abbots Priors  c Seeing the Storm arising which then threatned and soon after brought Destruction on those Orders thought it better Policy to comply with the times and surrender upon Terms in hopes to save something than hold out to the last as many did and lose all  And indeed the suppressing of those lesser Monasteries struck so great a Fear into the greater that the Statute made four Years after  Hen  cap whereby the Rest of the Religious Houses were given to the King recites  'That divers and sundry Abbots  c  of their own free and voluntary Mind since the fourth of  Feb  in the of his Reign had by due Order of Law and by their sufficient Writings of Record under their Convent and common Seals severally given granted and confirmed to the King his Heirs and Successors for ever All their said Monasteries Abbeys Priories  c  and all the Mannors Lordships Lands Tenements  Tythes  c to them belonging and had voluntarily renounced left and forsaken the same'  And therefore in the said Statute it is enacted  'That the King shall have hold  c  All such late Monasteries  c  and all the Sites Circuits Manners Lands Tenements  c  thereunto belonging'  In the ennumeration of the Particulars whereof which are many  Tythes  Parsonages appropriate and Vicarages are expresly mentioned All which as likewise all other Religious Houses with the Revenues thereof which should there after be dissolved suppressed relinquished forfeited or given to the King and which by that Statute are settled on him he was to hold and enjoy  in as large and ample Manner and Form as the late Abbots  c  had held or of right ought to have held the same in Right of their said late Monasteries  c  From hence this Observation arises That since those Religious Orders did hold the  Tythes  which they possessed upon the supposed Right of their being due  to God and Holy Church  which they held themselves and were by others holden to be a part of and the King received those  Tythes  and  Parsonages  amongst the rest of the Revenues of the Religious Houses as well those that were resigned to him by the Governours of those Houses themselves as the rest which by Act of Parliament he took upon the same Right on which those Religious Orders had holden them He also must hold them upon that supposed Right of their being due  to God and Holy Church  which he then held himself and was holden by all both  Clergy  and  Laity  to be the only  Supream Head  of here in  England  And as upon that supposed Right of their being  due to God and Holy Church  on which the Religious Houses held them they passed them from those Houses to the King as  supream Head of the Church  So on the same supposed Right of their being  due to God and Holy Church  they passed from the King as  supream Head of the Church  to those whether  Spiritual  or  Lay  Persons unto whom the King granted them For they stuck not long in the King's Hand But he of his own meer Motion Liberality and Benignity as the Statute in the d Year of his Reign cap relates had by that time freely given and granted  c  unto divers and sundry of the Lords and Nobles as well  Spiritual  as  Temporal  and unto divers and many other Persons and Bodies politick  c  divers and many sundry Honours Castles Manors Lands Tenements and among the rest  Rectories  c  But great care was taken to retain and keep up the Character of  Spirituality  which had formerly been  stamped upon those  Rectories Parsonages  and other Revenues by  Tythes  into what Hands soever they were passed And therefore by the Statute of  Hen  cap in case of withholding or denying to pay the Tythes all Persons claiming them  Impropriators  as well as  Priests  are restrained from suing in the  Temporal Courts  and limitted to the  Ecclesiastical  or  Spiritual Courts  only for the Recovery of them  And that they might still have Dependence upon the  Supremacy  care was taken from the first by the Statute of  Hen  cap That none of these Estates which then had come or should come from any of those Religious Houses to the King should pass from him by Grant to any Person whatsoever without an express Reservation of a  Tenth  And in a subsequent Statute  Hen  cap complaint being made that altho' out of those Grants which the King had made to sundry Persons of Honours Castles Mannors Lands Tenements Rectories  c  which were under the Survey of the  Court of Augmentations  the  Tenths  had been reserved yet the Persons unto whom such Grants had been made though they had quietly enjoyed and taken the Issues and Profits of those Lands Rectories  c  had not paid the reserved Rents to the King Provision was made in that Statute by several  Forfeitures  and  NominePoenae  's to enforce the Payment thereof  Nor was Care taken of the  Ecclesiastical Head  the  King  only but of the  Ecclesiastical Members  the  Clergy  also Many if not most of which had Pensions or Portions issuing out of those Parsonages Rectories or other spiritual Benefices as they were counted which the Religious Orders held for besides that upon the increasing of those  Appropriations  whereby the  Parish Priests  were pinch'd there had been Provision made early in the time of K  Richard  the  Second  for the  Vicars  as well as for the  Poor  the Statute of  Ric  directing  'That upon the  Appropriation  of such Churches the  Diocaesian  of the Place or Bishop of the Diocess shall ordain according to the value of such Churches a convenient Sum of Money to be paid and distributed Yearly of the Fruits and Profits of the same Churches to the poor Parishioners and also that the Vicar be well and sufficiently endowed'  Which Statute so far at least as concerned the Vicars was afterwards confirmed by another Statue of  Hen  cap which expresly ordains  'That the Statute of Appropriation of Churches and of the Endowment of Vicars in the same made the th Year of K  Ric  the  d  be firmly holden and put in due Execution'  I say besides these the Stat of and of  Hen  cap takes notice  'That the ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons and other Ecclesiastical Persons of both Provinces of  Canterbury  and  York  having formerly in right of their Churches received out of the late Monasteries  c  divers Pensions and other Profits had after the Dissolution of those Houses been disturbed and denied of the having receiving and gathering of the said Pensions'  c  Whereupon it is in the said Statute enacted  'That if any Person or Persons being Farmer or Occupier of any Mannors Lands Tenements Parsonges Benefices or other Hereditaments of any of the said late Monasteries  c  by the King's Gift Grant Sale Exchange or other wise out of which any such Pensions  c  have been heretofore lawfully going answered or paid to any of the ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons and other Ecclesiastical Persons abovesaid do at any time after the First Day of  April  next coming wilfully deny the Payment thereof Then it shall be lawful for the said ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons or other Ecclesiastical Persons aforesaid being so denied to be satisfied and paid there of  c  to proceed in the Ecclesiastical Courts for the recovery thereof'  By which Statute all Pensions payable to ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons or other Ecclesiastical Person that had been possessed thereof at or within Ten Years next before the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries out of the Parsonages Rectories or Tythes holden by the said Monasteries  c  are confirmed and assured to such ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons and other Ecclesiastical Persons still  So that upon the whole besides what hath been said of Tythes in general with respect to the  Judaizing  and denying of Christ by the paying thereof which extends alike to all  Tythes  those claimed by the  Impropriator  as well as those claimed by the  Priest  the  Impropriate Tythes  being generally charged either with some Payment to the  Vicars  for enlarging of their  Stipends  or with  Pensions  to the ArchBishops Bishops ArchDeacons and other Ecclesiasticks all such of them as are so charged come under the same Objection that is made against paying to the Priest  viz  The upholding of a false Ministry to perform a false Worship And if any  Impropriation  may be supposed to be free from all those Charges yet all  Impropriators  as well as  Priests  being bound to pay the reserved  Tenths  to the King as  Supream Head of the Church  which were wont before to be paid to the  Pope  while he was owned for  Head of the Church  the paying of Tythes to an  Impropriator  is a  Recognizing  and  acknowledging  of a Man Bad or Good  Popish  or  Protestant  as it happens to be the only  Supream Head on Earth of the Church  Which is to set an  Human Head  to a  Spiritual Body  and to divest and deprive our Lord  Jesus Christ  of his undoubted Right who the Apostle says expresly is  the Head of the Body the Church  Col  And that not of Man's making or appointing but God  saith the Apostle  hath given him to be the Head over all things to the Church which is his Body  Ephes  T E  FINIS
