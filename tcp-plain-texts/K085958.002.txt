 HANNAH HEWIT  HANNAH HEWIT OR  THE FEMALE CRUSOE  BEING THE HISTORY OF A WOMAN OF  uncommon mental and personal accomplishments  WHO After a variety of extraordinary and interesting adventures in almost every station of life from splendid prosperity to abject adversity WAS CAST AWAY IN THE GROSVENOR EASTINDIAMAN And became for three years the sole inhabitant of AN ISLAND IN THE SOUTH SEAS  SUPPOSED TO BE WRITTEN BY HERSELF  THERE IS AN ESPECIAL PROVIDENCE IN THE FALL OF A SPARROW  VOLUME II  LONDON PRINTED FOR C DIBDIN AT HIS MUSIC WAREHOUSE NO STRAND  HANNAH HEWIT  BOOK III THE REVERSES OF HANNAH HEWIT'S FORTUNE FROM HER MARRIAGE TO HER BEING SHIPWRECKED IN THE GROSVENOR EASTINDIAMAN  CHAP I HANNAH AND JOHN DASH INTO LIFE AND SUCCEED RAPIDLY  IT is the custom of writers to terminate a history on the marriage of their Hero and Heroine forgetting that as they are then only at the beginning of their cares the  work stands a chance from that period of becoming more and more diversified consequently more and more interesting to the reader  As to what has befallen me I can safely say that some addition has been made to the measure of my care from the first moment I could remember which was pretty early to the moment I am now writing but I thank God my mind has strengthened in proportion to every exigency and the consciousness of having never intentionally brought any misery on my head affords me a comfort in the midst of all my afflictions that the guilty happy if I may so express myself might envy  Previous to the wedding we had many consultations as to the plan of life we should pursue I had saved nearly four hundred pounds from my own earnings and my brother's presents Hewit expected  to receive seven hundred pounds as his share of prize money and my brother would insist upon giving me five more as a marriage portion With this sum it was concluded that we could not do better than set up in business in London for though we were but a young couple Hewit being but twentythree and I not quite twenty they paid me the compliment of saying that with prudence like mine success could not fail to crown our endeavours  To be sure my brother talked something of taking Hewit to sea after the honey moon as he called it and I must own he himself did not seem very averse to the proposal but I parried that and every other objection with great success till finding the Wolverhampton manufacturers were charmed at the idea of my opening a warehouse in town and that they one and all were ready to give us  unlimited credit and assistance it would have been madness to have contended against a plan so very eligible and so evidently advantageous  John's master was one of the first that came into the above scheme and generonsly gave him up his indentures for the purpose remarking that as far as he knew the business he was a very good workman and at any rate he knew enough to superintend a shop of his own adding that if he was only careful and industrious assisted by ingenuity like mine we could not fail of making a fortune  All matters being now properly arrainged it was agreed that we should first go to Bristol to settle my brother's affairs and those of Hewit and then to town and that no time might be lost Mr Smallbrook undertook that a friend of his should be instructed to look out for a house and warehouse fit for our purpose  It must be confessed my heart warmed at these prospects and though I felt great regret at the idea of leaving so many valuable friends yet I had ever considered Wolverhampton as by no means the proper sphere for an emulative mind like mine to move in I panted for an opportunity of displaying my abilities such as they were in the only place where they could be seen to advantage How many patents had the suggestions of my ingenuity procured for others how just then that in future the profit should be my own and again a consideration above all these the love of John Hewit would of course encrease with my celebrity  The parting from my friends at Wolverhampton was truly interesting Parson Williams told John Hewit that he had the best wife in the world and John promised to make the best husband in the world I took a tender leave of my two female friends who promised to correspond  with me to be kind to Mrs Crow and to superintend my Sunday school Mr Smallbrook and Mr Gregory undertook to be our agents at Wolverhampton and we to be theirs' in London and now with hearts full of love and gratitude accompanied with the good wishes of our friends we set out for Bristol  My brother and Hewit in the course of a few weeks received their right But nothing could induce the former to have any thing more to do with the Bristol merchants He said they were sharks at sea crocodiles in shoal water and tygers on land So giving them a hearty curse it being now in time of peace he applied to some friends in London from whence he soon sailed commander of a fine WestIndiaman  On our arrival in town we found that Mr Smallbrook's friend had not neglected his commission He took us to see several  houses and at last we pitched upon one that seemed extremely well to answer our purpose It was situated in the most conspicuous part of Cockspurstreet  I seemed now in the very atmosphere I was born to breathe I was continually bringing out some improvement on every article in our way If a thing usually went by a weight I altered it and made it go by a spring if wheels went well by being vertical I made them go better by being horizontal every square form became by my direction an oblong and every circle lengthened into an oval at my bidding The business was to make every thing assume an unusual form Convenience had nothing to do with it Novelty was the only thing to be thought of Thus it soon grew as customary to enquire after the last new spring candlestick or reverberating cheese toaster at Hewit's  as after the last new comedy or tragedy at Drury Lane or Covent Garden  Through the medium of our extensive connections we were soon surrounded with friends and by continually keeping invention upon the stretch we had plenty of means to keep up a large and oppulent acquaintance Hewit was delighted at this and as the sum of all my wishes was the happiness of my husband I gave into perhaps more extravagance than at first was prudent without the smallest uneasiness however for my genius was inexhaustible and there was no fear but that the spirit of the English would ever be found to encourage ingenuity  We had an superb Villa kept a coach and a phaeton both with springs of my own invention which of course were instantly imitated and having in the country been advised to work in the garden on account  of a bilious habit I became in a short time an excellent botanist so that we abounded in town and country elegance all the result of my fancy  To crown our felicity I had now two sweet children the eldest a fine boy and the youngest a lovely girl  We had gone on in this style for five years visiting and been visited feasting and being feasted till there could not be a pitch of fashion which we did not arrive at and yet so confirmed was our success we could command the means to indulge ourselves in much more But I do not know how it was I never had a true relish for any of this pleasure and I have often been more delighted with contemplating the beauty of a leaf or a flower in an insulated greenhouse and hermitage which I had built in a large piece of water and in which I took greater pleasure than in all  the vain tinsel and tawdry trappings of a ballroom  One reason perhaps was this I could not find in all the variety of characters that surrounded me a creature like myself I had a warm heart and both professed and felt cordial friendship others were cold forbidding and inaccessable and though they professed as much as I did they felt nothing I envied no woman the possession of a handsome and accomplished husband Every woman seemed to envy me the possession of mine and every man to envy him the possession of me for under the mark of vivacity and gallantry all his friends made love to me and all mine seemed as if they wished he should make love to them  This life of all pleasure and no happiness threw me at times into a very deep melancholy Not being able to applaud  myself for giving into such folly and absurdity the applause of the giddy and the vain operated as a severe satire on my conduct and many a smile that I forced into my face in public has been followed by an involuntary tear the moment I was alone  My greatest pleasure was to take my children to my little island and watch my improvements Ah how often have I indulged there an irresistable impulse no doubt a foreboding of my present fate that confidently assured me were that spot separated from human society so that I could have my husband and my children and merely common necessaries I should be much more happy than in such a deceitful world  This train of ideas made me resolve to prevail on my husband who seemed as if he lived but to oblige me to save a certo  retire from the bustle of the world He came into my proposal and there appeared just then an admirable opportunity of accelerating such a scheme  A tin mine was said to have been discovered on one side of Salisbury plain and the shares in it were expected to yield at least forty  per cent  We enquired into the particulars and finding very solid ground to believe that we should be perfectly secure we adventured nine thousand pounds in the scheme  This brought me a good deal about The expectation of hitting on a way to accomplish my plan of ease and retirement made me bear the tumult of the world with renewed sprightliness and good humour and the pleasure this gave my husband absorbing every other consideration I joined in the throng and my melancholy though ever intense was never perceived  CHAP II HANNAH AND JOHN GO ON IN A GREAT STYLE AND ARE SURROUNDED BY DEPENDANTS OF ALL DESCRIPTIONS  MY taste was now consulted in every thing The Hewit cap the Hewit bonnet and the Hewit robe were all the fashion and if I had had vanity enough to credit the assertions of those who partook of our dinners I possessed more refined elegance than any woman in town  There was no end to the train that surrounded us I painted and every poor artist in town courted my opinion I wrote and all the poor poets dedicated  their works to me I understood a little of music and my patronage was sought by all the frequenters of the Orange Coffeehouse  My sonnets elegies and eclogues I knew not how got into the papers under the signature of 'Petrach's Laura' They were afterwards selected into a pocket volume and most impartially celebrated as a model for English poetry in the Reviews Daubings that would have disgraced a clubroom were first exhibited and afterwards engraved by subscription under an idea that they had the honour and advantage of my sanction and many an easy set of sonatos which it was impossible for any body to play had a prodigious run from the fortunate circumstance of my having done them the honour to give them a place on my piano forte an instrument something between the virginal and the clarichord struck by hammers originally made from a suggestion of  mine and which on that account had just then became the height of the mode and has obtained wonderfully since  I permitted all this nonsence not to gratify my own vanity for to consider properly it was a severe sarcasm to patronize stupidity but that the poor rogues might eat Not that every case was alike All my dependants were bad enough off but not equally so My painters through signposts coachmakers cheap magazines or the theatres could get something to eat and a musician with a fiddle under his arm found no difficulty in scraping up a little bread  But the case was different with the poor poet He must shiver in the avenues of Paternosterrow and watch with deference and respect for the fortunate moment of being called in to earn the liberal sum of half a guinea by doing a magazine If he be a retainer to a newspaper  he must while he is torne with hunger describe sumptuous feasts while he roams without a lodging he must expatiate upon gorgeous palaces and he must minutely particularize every beauty of court dresses on a birth day while he is trembling without a coat to his back  Though I heartily lamented the occasion I cannot help saying that it gave me some satisfaction to be able by a knowledge of these circumstances to account for the scandalous and shameful rancour with which these poor devils bespatter one another Literature by expanding the mind is surely calculated to convey noble and generous sentiments and in proportion as the human intellects are enlarged and improved so one would think they would become fraught with the divinely social quality of beneficence but as we are taught to consider self preservation as paramount to all other motives so it must be that consideration and that only in  men of enlightened manners and informed minds which can possibly account for their barking and snarling and snatching the fluctuating morsel from each others' mouth like so many half famished curs  This also I should suppose has an effect on their tempers and thus their tempers are reflected in their writings One addresses your feelings in his works in the language of an incendiary as if he thought you could be bullied into compassion and reviles the age and every one in it implying that there is no virtuous man but himself the prominent feature of whose virtue he convinces you by his manner is vain assumption and impertinent arrogance  Another no less hurt throws into his style all the oily smoothness of fulsome adulation and with the same ductile pliability praises every body and every thing  but his commendation is an affront and his flattery a nausea for no man can be all virtue any more than he can be all vice and indeed even if he spoke his sentiments he is the last man in the world to judge of what he writes for while his pen emits milk his heart overflows with gall and while he effects the language of candour he is torne with the gnawings of envy  As to the lady writers whose meritorious exertions I had so much admired in the country they none of them came in my way being well patronized before and if they had there were many reasons why I must have declined assisting them all which are very probably obvious to the reader I shall therefore only say that now my judgment had grown more mature I considerably altered my opinion and wondered how the age could with any degree of patience except in such instances as my namesake Hannah More  Miss Seward my dear Miss Margery Williams and a few others receive lessons of virtue and morality from women the notoriety of whose practices gave the broad lie to their precepts  Being I own a little wickedly inclined to impose upon that world which I saw so willing to impose upon itself I now and then helped my poor dependants out by substituting a portion of my ingenuity to make up their deficiency in merit If an author had failed by a poem I made him succeed by a puzzle if a musician lost money by composing what was easy I brought him up by shewing him how to compose what was impracticable if a painter could not succeed by imitating nature I made him strike into caracature Every body recollects the cylindrical prints they were entirely of my invention  But the thing in which I best suceeded  was an invention of mine to serve Walmesley who having made one voyage with my brother to the West Indies determined on his return to live peaceably upon Terra Firma We all contributed towards establishing him and it was resolved he should open a warehouse for the sale of patent medicines which as the reader knows he was well qualified to counterfeit  Celebrity however is only to be attained by novelty I therefore invented a new medicine which was to cure or rather to prevent every possible species of disorder to which the human frame is liable The doctrine upon which this assertion hinged was this All disorders proceed from the blood and could that fluid be kept pure and uncontaminated it must be clear to every capacity that there would immediately be an end of gouts fevers and all the long catalogue of complaints inumerated in the bills of mortality  The virtue of eradicating every species of impurity from the circulation we were to prove that our nostrum clearly possessed which I went about to do in the hand bill I drew up for Walmesley in the following manner  I called this sovereign remedy 'The Universal Specific or Essence of May Dew impregnated with Spirit of Owl's Dung' I then held this argument The blood is certainly in its purest state when both the body and mind are in their strongest vigour Now the month of May is the most vigorous and healthy month in the year and the owl is the bird of wisdom inasmuch as Minerva herself has the image of that bird for her crest  May dew has sensibly been called the Essence of Vegetation and it is believed by more than one writer on agriculture to contain particles imbued with nutrimental qualities which perforating  the pores of the leaf on which the dew falls penetrate the sap and consequently contribute to the health of the plant  Thus I fairly established my position as far as it related to animal existence by means of fermentation a quality I argued as certainly essential as putresaction for man is an entity part animal part vegetable hair and nails being brought to perfection as mechanically as cucumbers for like them they are improved by pruning and like them grow best hair especially in a hot soil  To make good the remainder of my argument I reasoned thus As animal existence is allowed in great measure to depend on putrefaction as the owl is the bird of all others endowed with most wisdom and as wisdom is the mind's health the owl's dung being the putrefacton of wisdom the spirit extracted from it must naturally materially brace and strengthen  the mind and consequently assist in promoting the vigour of the body  By the time this medicine had been seen on my toilette and on the toilettes of some ladies of my acquaintance it took beyond credibility and Walmesley perfectly in his element was enabled to lavish what he received from the follies of the rich to relieve the miseries of the poor  CHAP III FORTUNE GROWS FICKLE FRIENDS BEGIN TO BE COOL HANNAH WAKES FROM HER DREAM OF PROSPERITY JOHN IS AFRAID OF THE BAILIFFS AND CAPTAIN HIGGINS GETS INTO A PRISON  BEING now on the very pinnacle of our hopes having for more than eight years experienced a series of pleasure and profit scarcely credible we were fated to experience a most dreadful reverse The tin mines turned out a bubble After so much money and labour had been lavished away and disappointment that had perpetually succeeded to expectation seemed perpetually to be revived with new hopes like the projection of a chemist on the eve of finding the philosopher's stone every thing was flown  in fumo  No tin was to be found and now all the world who had encouraged our hopes and assured us we could not fail of making a fortune for the first time discovered that nothing could be so mad and absurd as to search for tin upon Salisbury Plain  It was now absolutely necessary immediately to retrench and in retrenching it was necessary to give up our fashionable friends Poor Hewit thought otherwise and Timon like indulged considerable expectation from the friendship of those to whom we indeed had shewn friendship but he soon found himself egregiously deceived There was not a single creature in all the buzzing croud that had fluttered round us but flew off and left us as if we had been a contagion  The cry wasHow could such upstarts presume to vie with people of fashion They had better have stuck to their business  but this was always the case 'twas not the first instance of low people being ruined by aping their superiors It was plain to see that every thing had been a long time going to rack and ruin They did not make half such good snuffers as they used to do In short the squibs and sarcasms that flew about were innumerable and though but a month before had we been actually guilty of any crime we could have found friends to have proved us immaculate had we now been accused though perfectly innocent it would have gone hard with us nor did we escape my very artists I was lampooned in a song called Pride out of tune by a musician for whom I got a large subscription a painter I had taught to caracature others caracatured me and my milky poet who had nauseated me with adulation now levelled a volley of scurility against me in a poem under the title of 'Sappho in the Tin Mines'  For my own part had it not been for the loss of fortune I should have rejoiced at all this for I had long wished to give Hewit a distaste to the world and this fairly completed my purpose  One thing in particular took effect exactly as I had wished my husband and I as before mentioned had a dispute when first we ourselves received the news of our loss and while it continued unknown to our acquaintance He being of opinion that we should keep their countenance and good wishes and I that we should be utterly forsaken I offered to put it at issue in a way that pleased him very much  Having a good deal led the fashions my taste as I before observed was looked up to as a pattern of elegance but particularly as to the shape I altered the waist at any time in a month and at the period  I am speaking of I had brought it to such a length that when a lady sat down the peak of her stays touched the chair My proposal was all of a sudden to shorten the waist to nothing to tye a sash immediately under the arms and let all below resemble a promiscuous mass of loose drapery under an idea that the fashion was Grecian  At the same time I proposed that Hewit should have a great coat made without skirts and his excuse should be that skirts were an inconvenient thing in the rain and that the upper part would answer all the purpose of warmth for which great coats were worne We both agreed that the fashion would be followed the dispute was whether or not they would continue it when they knew our reverse of fortune  He agreed to abide the trial and on the following Sunday we drove round the  Ring in Hyde Park dressed in our new Hewits which were first the surprize and afterwards the admiration of every body The papers were full of the new Hewits On the following Sunday many people wore them on the Sunday after every body wore them and on the Sunday after that our ill fortune getting scent in the interval every body left them off  Upon a fair review of our situation there appeared nothing desperate in it for though Mr Smallbrook was dead and Mr Gregory had retired from business which by the way cut off all communication between me and Miss Binns who had been gone some time under the care of a friend to the East Indies yet our Wolverhampton and Pontepool connections were as extensive as ever and though it did not appear that we could perfect our plan of retirement as soon as could be expected yet there did not seem  to be much danger with care of our living in a very comfortable style  But now came a severe stroke indeed The business of the tin mines had been as complete a deception as the famous South Sea bubble Several individuals concerned were declared bankrupts and it soon became evident that no real money had been employed in it but ours We began now to tremble for the consequences for as the whole was completely a partnership we feared that the solvent parties might be sued for deficiencies These fears were soon realized and in the course of a few months demands were exhibited against us to the amount of almost twelve thousand pounds  Ruin now stared us in the face To appease the rapacity of the most importunate first went the lease of the house in the country with all my improvementsThe carriages had been put down beforeNext  jewels then plate in short we stript ourselves and yet were as much pestered as ever nor did misfortune threaten us alone my elder brother who had made several very successful voyages to the WestIndies had been prevailed on by the very same set to trade according to his own fancy upon a two years voyage The plan was his own and it must be confessed it was a good idea  He was to purchase commodities at any place he thought proper where they were cheap and to fell them in countries where they were dear They fitted him out with money to their last guinea and all their expectation of a supply was from what he might have to remit them He always just remitted to the very shilling drawing upon them for repairs victualing and others incurred expences according to the nature of the exigency It so happened that having been at several markets up the Streights and in different parts of  the Mediterranian he had in his hands of theirs upwards of three thousand pounds which he informed them of and also that he meant to bring it home the term of his voyage being nearly expired  Having put into Leghorn he was astonished at being applied to for a bill of four hundred pounds which his owners had refused to accept and which had therefore been protested in form He paid it of course with their money but could not help thinking there was something extraordinary in the transaction He however thought it could be some how or other explained and touched at another part where a demand in the same way was exhibited against him of seven hundred pounds In short before he reached the Thames he had paid upwards of two thousand pounds of his owners' money in this manner  Having fairly now discovered what  men he had to deal with he determined the moment he set his foot ashore to consult some attorney as to what steps he could take against them for his name was out upon all their engagements  The attorney informed him with very little ceremony that there was a statute of bankruptcy out against his owners that among the accounts they had given in was one charging him with the value of the ship and her different cargoes all correctly specified in letters and memorandums received from himself and also three thousand pounds and upwards which money he had acquainted them remained in his hands before he touched at Leghorn That as these were large sums and the assignees were very anxious to receive all monies due to the creditors at large he had sued out a process against him to be ready on his arrival and he might now have his choice of going either to a Spunginghouse  or at once to Newgate as he might think proper  Thus did I welcome my brother home by visiting him in Newgate from whence however he was soon removed to the Fleet where we had scarcely seen him safe but we had reason enough to believe we should soon join him In the mean time as we paid enormous sums through the villainy of the same oppressors we were told that we might have our remedy against them among whom to my confusion as it came out upon an investigation were collaterally concerned the villain Sourby and my unnatural brother the lawyer  CHAP IV HANNAH AND JOHN TO AVOID THE MALICE OF THE WORLD ASSUME THE GARB OF HUMILITY  THEfurther we looked into our affairs the more we were confirmed in the certainty that our ruin and my brother's had been long regularly and systematically determined upon From the moment our good genius took us by the hand and led us on towards prosperity and independence those fiends Sourby and my brother the lawyer were contriving in secret some diabolical scheme to fatten themselves at the expence of our industry  I own I had at times feared something of this for my brother the lawyer had soon after we settled in town made several attempts at a reconciliation which I never would submit to and Sourby had thrown himself purposely in the way of Hewit at public places and once at a coffeehouse he managed to be of a party at a card table where John was presently cheated out of fifty pounds Indeed one evening he had the audacity to address me in a very particular manner at the rout of a person of distinction and when I repulsed his impertinence in the manner it deserved he told me in a very pointed manner that high as I carried my head at present I might one day perhaps be obliged to humble to him  It was plain now that we had not a single moment to lose The first step was to keep Hewit out of the way that he might not share the fate of my brother  For this purpose we hid him at Walmesley's where while I set my face to the weather at home he drew out a faithful account of our affairs in order to see what it would be in our power to do to keep our heads above water  This however appeared to be impracticable for our property had been so impaired by the late various and heavy demands that we had of what we could call our own but little more than would cover the just due of those tradesmen and manufacturers whose debts indeed the only legal debts we owed we were determined honourably and conscientiously to discharge  In our counsels therefore which we held at my brother's apartment in the Fleet every Sunday where by the way his unconquerable fortitude and sweetness of temper had endeared him to every body it was thought expedient for Hewit  to execute a deed of trust in favour of my brother that the property might be immediately appropriated by him to the payment of our legal debts  This was done possession was then given and our tormentors had no remedy as to property Circular letters were next written to those creditors we meant to pay who as the reader will learn were honourably paid twenty shillings in the pound  The villains who had ruined us were now of course so exasperated that it became more necessary than ever to conceal the person of Hewit This could not be done at Walmesley's and to place him any where else might be attended with aggravated danger besides being expensive and inconvenient What to do We once had an idea of surrendering him to the Fleet but then it occurred to us that it might be an imprisonment for life especially at  the instance of such implacable enemies and again why anticipate a fate which it would be time enough to submit to when it should be unavoidable  A variety of expedients suggested themselves At last I hit on one which at any rate would give us breathing time and which I thought I could fashion so to Hewit's taste as to divert his mind now completely depressed I therefore thus explained my scheme to him  "It is absolutely necessary my dear Hewit to exist by our industry or starve We have two sweet children and we must find bread for them 'Tis true I can earn money but it will be impossible to be safe where we are known I have therefore a plan to propose to you which at first will look a little romantic but which I think upon reflection you will approve I have thought of it with pleasure upon many accounts In the first place it will take a  load off your mind in the next place it will give you an opportunity of laughing at that world which is now laughing at you again it will procure me the coveteous happiness of having you entirely to myself and lastly it will strengthen if possible your affection for me by shewing you that I am ready to embrace any fortune though ever so humble out of affection to you  "In short my love" said I "this is what I propose That you should visit those parts of the kingdom where we are unknown as a Razorgrinder attended by your wife and children Our grandeur shall be changed to humility the hand of necessity shall form our coach into a machine for whetting knives and scissars our phaeton shall be converted into panniers and our stud into an ass as a memento of that folly which taught us to lavish our fortune on an ungrateful world  "Well" continued I "how do you relish my scheme Is it not at least as seasible as Walmesley's turning bear I think it is and if I mistake not I'll make it as amusing For one thing suffer what we may you shall never see me without a smile indeed prosperity has often sorced from my eyes those tears to which the children of humility are strangers The chearfulness of industry smooths the path of poverty it looks forward with hope prosperity shrinks backward with fear and men raise those edifices brick by brick that when they fall fall all at once"  'By heaven' said John 'you are an angel Hannah and I'll follow you to the world's end I will laugh at the world indeed oppress me as it may I have a right to laugh at it for I have tricked it of you a prize of more value than all that's left' I was delighted at his kindness and his willingness to embrace my offer and it  was agreed to put our scheme in execution immediately Not to detain the reader Walmesley bought a razorgrinder's travelling apparatus an ass and a pair of panniers I gathered together some necessaries and such materials as I knew I could turn to account I concerted with my brother how we should correspond with each other and when every necessary preliminary was settled we sallied forth on the th of September a child in each pannier John crying 'Razors to Grind' and I decked with a string of pincushions and trinkets for sale on the way  Till we got at a distance from town we were rather uneasy and our apprehension was not a little increased by the very particular notice every body took of us which upon reflection only arose from our exhibiting a perfect picture of industry for I was dressed so tidy John looked so clean and our children so wholesome that  people gave us more work out of curiosity than would have fallen to our share had there been nothing particular in our appearance and at any rate more than we wished for on account of the small distance we had yet got from London  The reflection was now verified that I had a thousand times made If people are ever so poor they may be comfortable to themselves and command the attention of the world particularly women Instead of lounging with a child over the arm in a crampt attitude listening to the scandal of every washerwoman in the parish her face all grimed her cloaths all filth the wife of a labourer bestired herself to prepare a cleanly repast for her returning husband and washed her face that he might see those smiles with which he has a right to be received I will venture to say cottages might be the seat of content and comfort and honest hard working men would solace  themselves with real pleasures at home instead of being driven by slaternlyness and ill temper to seek for artificial pleasures in an alehouse  This was exemplified at least in me I had proposed to Hewit that when we found a good place for our purpose we should settle there for a given time in some comfortable cleanly cottage by which means we should be enabled to avoid all the vulgar croud that would otherwise very much annoy us if we took up our residence among the common herd at alehouses  I had another reason also for this As our conversation and conduct in every respect were a good deal above the level of persons in our situation I wished to prevent as much as possible all prying into our affairs for as I knew by experience that people in the country seldom give a kind motive to what they cannot comprehend  I did not know but one of those singular chances which seemed particularly to characterize our fortune might drag us from our concealment and send us to join my brother  In spight of all my caution however in the course of our itinerant expedition there exists scarcely a motive that could possibly apply to our conduct but was by some person or other attributed to it The exciseman at Colchester said he should not wonder if we were smugglers and declared one evening at an alehouse which intelligence we received from a very kind friend who gave the caution in order to put us upon our guard that if the lawyer was of opinion he could stand to it he would undertake to search us  He added that Flanders lace was a thing very easy of conveyance and said that he had suspected that there was something going forward by my being sent for  by so many ladies in the neighbourhood who had indeed bought trinkets of me and concluded by saying that there was no chance of a reform in smuggling while the heads of the nation connived at it  At Harwich an old drummajor was almost confident we were spies He had noticed my taking a sketch of the harbour the lighthouse and other objects near the sea and was almost sure he had heard me say something one day that sounded very like the French lingo  But the most curious and indeed the most serious thing that happened was in a large manufacturing town in Yorkshire where we were suspected of being persons employed by government to mix among the lower classes of the people to detect sedition  It is certainthe people there being principally dissenters and full of fanaticism  indeed almost the only laborious body in the kingdom where the mild doctrines of Mr Westley who always recommended a spirit of loyalty and a love of order had not prevailedmoody discontent and turbulent disquiet seemed to mark this dingy race Their faces their shirts and their minds seemed to be equally grimed and instead of gratitude to providence for placing them in a land the best calculated upon earth to protect their families and secure their property these demons in their fuliginous pandemonium were perpetually seeking to overturn that order their gloomy souls had no relish for  Hewit and I who were both from inclination and duty firmly loyal used to combat the nonsense and wickedness of these people whose sanguinary scheme though yet in embryo it was plain to see if not instantly checked would one day expand to the ruin of all order and goodfellowship They instantly became shy  of us and my landlord having one day picked up a letter from Walmesley which being interlarded with quotations from plays seemed to favour his suspicions I remember one of them was "The resty knaves are overrun with ease as plenty ever is the nurse of faction" we received a civil intimation that it would be as safe for us to retire to some other place a hint we did not fail instantly to profit ourselves of  I shall not name this place where I saw the seeds of faction lying dormant like the eggs of serpents if they have been crushed let oblivion hide them if they have expanded and have torne the bowels of the parent that fostered them let the execration of their fellow creatures be the punishment of those who laid them  CHAP V MORE ANIMADVERSIONS ON MEN AND MANNERS AND A LETTER FROM CAPTAIN HIGGINS  IN this manner being strangers every where come where we would public curiosity was excited till at length really it did not seem as if we were born to mix in any sort of society at all for as our vulgar intrusion into high life had been scouted the moment we became poor so forcing ourselves into low life with our decent manners and appearance exposed us to a suspicion that we were richer than we would be thought in which case what  was the natural conclusion but that we were afraid of telling who we were  All we met with however treated us civily enough because we wanted no assistance from them and even the woman of whom I bought black tea at the chandler's shop and who had been the whole morning entertaining her customers with stories she had either heard and exaggerated or invented of me allowed that though with my fair skin and delicate hands it was plain to see I had never been used to hard work and therefore must have been a gentlewoman she for her part would put no bad instructions upon the thing and dared to say that it was all along of my hard hearted parents who had cut me with a shilling and disinheritated me for marrying a handsome razorgrinder  But I saw nothing in their clamour against me that they did not raise against  one another If the farrier's daughter refreshed a lilac ribband with pearl ashes that was cast off by her ladyship's woman it was look at Miss with her fine top knot If the 'squire's gentleman gave Hodge the pig driver a pair of shoes to prevent his going bare foot it was look at the gentleman in his dancing pumps  Thus was the churchyard of a Sunday just after the parson had admonished his parishioners and charged them not to slander their neighbours filled with sarcastic rustics making satirical remarks and thus it went in gradation all the way up from the washerwoman to the 'squire's lady The blue apron envied the check the check the holland the holland the plain muslin the plain muslin the sprigged the sprigged the flounced the flounced the gauze and the gauze the blond lace  What does this say more than that human  nature is human nature in all stations and that however the other qualities of mankind may fluctuate and vary envy is always stationary  Envy is so natural to the heart of man that we are not contented with detracting from living merit but by a horrible effect of that diabolical passion we cease to regret merit when it is no more and even the praise of great men after their death is extorted from us for we allow it not out of respect to their virtues but to throw an envious shadow over those who fill their situations I declare I have heard as malicious a sarcasm from a rustic in a cottage aye and as witty too as ever I did from the most accomplished pupil of irony in a circle of the first fashion  Did the limits of this work permit me I could relate in it the histories of onethird of the kingdom for let our stay be ever so short in a place I was sure to hear  all that had befallen its inhabitants and their families for a century  The grandfather of one man of fortune had been a labourer at the time of pulling down an old abbey where he found a stone coffin filled full of money Another had a great uncle who was a blue coat boy and he was bribed at the drawing of the lottery to secrete the ten thousand pound prize for which piece of roguery he was rewarded with half the amount and being afterwards honest and industrious he had so thriven in the world that though he never got rid of the nick name of Tom of Ten Thousand the family were now worth oceans  A certain baronet had risen in the world by a little false step which his grandmother made with a Prince who was lost in a forest a hunting Another gentleman a great lawyer possessed a very large estate  in consequence of a distant relation's having contrived to hang an innocent man but the money never prospered with any of them for the ghost of the man haunted all the family till they dropt off one by one and now this only remaining heir was going after the rest for he was reported to have a wolf in his arm which made now and then a horrible howling but the fact was the noise was occasioned by the gnawings of his conscience  These and many other stories was I compelled to hear and indeed compelled to wonder at otherwise I should have made my own case more enigmatical than it appeared before My astonishment was that had what I heard been correctly fact the foundation of all the wealth in the kingdom must have been a large mass composed of every monstrous and detestable crime that could humiliate and disgrace human nature  For my own part I could have wished had such a thing been possible to have heard of fortunes which had sprung from honourable desert true patriotism or laudable industry but I could never coax out any acknowledgment of this kind and even when I alledged that oppulent men had founded charities and built hospitals 'It was very true but men could not take their money with them and it was policy to leave strangers to speak well of them after death that their clamour might drown the voices of those who knew them'  For nearly three years did we follow this itinerant life which though it was attended with many unpleasant circumstances had its moments of satisfaction Hewit entered so much into the spirit of regarding the scenes we witnessed as if looking at a comedy that though I saw a little further and in the end felt commiseration  for that which at first I had laughed at I never checked his good humour but rather encouraged him to divert himself at the ridiculous side of the picture than pity the envious reverse of it  During this time I had frequently heard from my brother who had honourably so far settled our affairs that all those with whom we had any business declared they were handsomely satisfied and perfectly disposed whenever we thought proper to demand it to give us credit again Poor soul he had gone on but indifferently himself for he was too proud to sue to those he had formerly assisted which neglect they took comfortably to themselves as a sufficient excuse why they should not assist him  I cannot describe his situation better than by giving the reader one of his letters  DEAR HANNAH  I have been weather bound in this same Fleet now twelve months and see no more prospect of making land than the first moment I set my foot aboard however when the wind won't favour us we must manoeuvre The worst of it is I have been upon such cursed short allowance It would make you laugh if you knew how I managed  I first set up a Missisippi Table but you don't know what that is it is a plain upon which you trundle an ivory ball with a view to reach a certain mark but that's no easy matter There are barriers set to impede its progress just as there are to prevent an honest man from going through the world if he can miss them well and good if not the game is up I was a fool for my pains in this business The rogues took their winnings and paid their losings but always ticked for the  table besides it was just then determined that no tables of chance should be kept but for the purpose of ruining heirs encouraging of bankers' clerks to cheat their masters and tradesmen to ruin their families so as I had no such virtuous intentions by the time I had about nine and thirty two halfpenny customers in my debt the commander of the Fleet gave the signal to break up my table  After this I turned coblerWhat do you laugh at you jade Why should not I turn cobler as well as Jack Hewit turn razorgrinder My father always told me if I was to be a cobler I should be the best in the street I did as little at that however as the other How could I expect to mend people's shoes who had none to their feet  I did not know what to do next I had some thoughts of going partners with Walmesley and setting up a bit of a quack  shop but this was worse cobbling than the other for all the money here goes to buy kitchen physic  I made after this rackets and balls for the Fivescourt to as little purpose as the rest for as in the case of the Missisippi table I found that shabby gamesters are as averse to paying any thing but their debts of honour as genteel ones but however though I got but little profit my occupation supplied me with plenty of amusement for as marker general I had a curious number of disputes to arbitrate  It was not above a week ago that a butcher in Fleetmarket being accused by a baronet of cheating declared upon his honour as a gentleman that his honour the baronet was a shabby ill begotten no nation rip and that if he twigged him any of his rum gammon he'd box his honour  for a bellyful I knew the baronet to be a man of an excellent heart of strict honour and of finished manners and therefore that he stood no chance with such a fellow So I took him off his hands and hinting to him what I knew would draw on me a volley of abuse I took that for an excuse for giving him a bellyful and such a one as I fancy prevented his eating for a week But says you how came this baronet gaming with a butcher Alas my dear girl misery brings us acquainted with strange companions Pride is a bad ingredient for a prison and if I have sat down at a gaming house near the court which I have with a taylor a lord an ambassador and a marker at a tenniscourt what wonder in jail if the tables are turned and instead of butchers keeping company with people of fashion people of fashion should be obliged to keep company with butchers  Getting this knack of setting people to rights I was the other day voted unanimously Chief Justice of the Fleet for you must know we have a regular court and a code of excellent laws and I mean to be as equitable as Sancho in his government I have done but little yet only reconciled a few family brawls and prevented some mischief in consequence of two or three religious controversies What have families to do with quarrelling here Have they not had enough of quarrelling with the world And what business have men to talk here upon any subject of religion but patience It puts me in mind of two cabin boys How often said one have you prayers Why said the other in a gale of wind and sometimes of a Sunday Ay now said the first there is some sense in that but our swab of a chaplain makes us say prayers when there is no more call for it than to knock one's head against the main mast  But I forgot Hannah that you are in a situation to make remarks of a piece with mine Better fortune to us both Tell Hewit he is a good fellow for paying you so much attention  Your affectionate brother THOMAS HIGGINS  I received several other letters from my brother one of which in particular gave me great pleasure for it informed me that some person had privately sent him a hundred pounds which as he did not know who to return it to he said he should consider as his own in hopes he should one day or other find the owner and be able to pay him two for it in return  Our original intention was to stay away six years that in case we were persecuted on our return we might plead  the statute of limitations but before we had accomplished half that term an extraordinary accident frustrated that and apparently every other pleasureable prospect  CHAP VI AN EXTRAORDINARY MEEETINGAN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE OF INTELLIGENCEAN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEYAN EXTRAORDINARY FRIENDAND AN EXTRAORDINARY REVERSE OF FORTUNE  BEING at Liecester as I was one morning going to market to buy our day's provisions which I always took care though homely should be clean and wholesome I passed by the county jail and when I came to the begging grate I dropt a halfpenny in the box at which a wretched woman in a melancholy tone said 'Heaven bless you good lady' Alas I am no lady said I I wish I was and rich enough to relieve all the distress of this prison  I had scarce uttered these words when a man in a most squalid condition came forward crying out "Who calls on Achmet Did not Barbarossa require me here Nay do not mock me I am weak and foolish Methinks I should know you It is it is 'tis Hannah Hewit I now remember well each circumstance"  The reader already sees that this curious rhapsody could proceed from nobody but poor Walmesley but how he came there and in such a condition was beyond my conception and it was utterly impossible to learn it from him at that moment at the same time as a mob was gathering round us I put some silver into his hand begged him to get some refreshment and promised him that Hewit and I would pay him a visit in the course of an hour  The keeper of the jail who seeing the  people assemble came to learn what was the matter paid particular attention to the latter part of our conversation He seemed extremely pleased at the prospect of conjuring up a friend for Walmesley and said that if Mr Hewit and I would come and take a bit of dinner he had a snug little parlour and would take care that we should be charged very reasonably  All this I related to Hewit who agreed to take the children and spend the day with poor Walmesley in the castle to whom we had previously however conveyed some clean things and really what with being thus refreshed and his pleasure at finding his old friends by the time we arrived he looked very decent and appeared full of vivacity  Walmesley told us that he had been ruined by falling under the displeasure of the college of physicians They had gained over the two licentiates who in consequence  of receiving a large share of the profits accruing from the sale of the Universal Specific had signed his petition and procured him a diploma from Glasgow which circumstance by the way I ought to have mentioned before and it was unanimously agreed by way of rendering a general benefit to society to analyze the medicine in order to prosecute the vender as an impostor or by way of giving their proceedings a colour of impartially to recommend it provided it should prove genuine in its purport and salutary in its effect  After a most elaborate chemical inquisition they very gravely and deliberately gave a report that the nostrum in question was a vile imposition and not in any wise calculated to answer the purposes for which it was intended being devised not only to destroy the health but ridicule the understandings of his majesty's liege subjects  for that the Essence of May Dew as they had proved by many ingenious experiments was only an effervescence produced by sour small beer and magnisia alba and that the spirit so far from being the true spirit of owl's dung waswhich had been rendered demonstrable by a most subtle and complex process from whence had arisen various phenomenae hereafter to be enumerated in a publication intended for the information of the Royal Society and the edification of the whole worldneither more nor less than an extract from the excrement of a goose  These gentlemen learned in physic had therefore recourse to other gentlemen learned in the law and between them both poor Walmesley was so handled that he was glad enough to sell off his gallipots stock and block and decamp with the shattered remains of his fortune  He immediately endeavoured to find  us but as we had just at that time changed our route in consequence of our being suspected of belonging to a gang of gipsies and had not informed my brother of it he took a wrong road and had been travelling about as an actor for several months when chance had brought us together in the extraordinary manner I have above related  The reader knows that Walmesley was perpetually ruining himself for other people Upon our asking him how he came there he said it was all to save poor Dick Douce from limbo Well but said Hewit why could not he as well go to limbo as you 'Oh lord a different thing' said Walmesley 'I en't married I have not got a fine slatternly wife and three filthy children squalling round me besides the fellow was in the jaundice looked as yellow as a guinea a colour his pocket had been long a stranger to Oh the obligation of my violent love outran the  pause of reason In short I took the thing upon myself who could refrain that had a heart to love and in that heart courage to make his love known And so you see Dick's gone on with the company and I am here No more of that I have done the state some service and they know it  'Now after all people talk of a prison what is there in a prison I dare say I sleep upon as soft a board as any in the place and then you see what a nice clean shirt I have got on and again for jail distempers all a joke the healthiest place in the world the devil of any distemper have I had since I came here but hunger'  When it grew towards dusk and we were about to take leave of Walmesley the gaoler came in and said he hoped every thing had been to our satisfaction he then begged he might be his tiff of punch After it was brought in he began to talk  of his profession which he wished to give us an idea he had exercised with a true regard to those feelings which induce men to comfort instead of insult the afflicted  He said for example that if he had the stuff against John Hewit Esq late living in Cockspurstreet the Haymarket and was by accident to surprize him in his travelling dress of a razorgrinder why did any body think he would go for to treat him and sweet madam Hewit in an out of the way manner No he knew what breeding was and how to behave to a gemman that was a gemman Hollo said Hewit why this is the second act of the Vigo businessCome come said I Sir if you have any drift in this let us know it 'Why then if you will have the long and the short on't' said the gaoler 'I have got the stuff against John Hewit for three hundred and thirty pounds at the suit of Messrs Winkworth and Broadhead and  when the attorney writes to town I expects to have a good deal more'  "How' said Walmesley 'the prince's near ally my very friend hath got his mortal hurt in my behalf Away to Heaven respective lenity and fire eyed fury be my conduct now" 'Come come none of of your fury' said the gaoler 'you have been treated pretty well since you have been here I'm sure if I had not known you to be an actor man with your antics and monkey tricks I should have called in the crowner and put you in a strait waistbefore now'  Well Sir said I there is no need of altercation we are your prisoners 'You e'nt madam' said the gaoler I wish you was though damme if I should not like to be your prisoner for you are a nice handsome bit' "Come Sir" said Hewit "there is no necessity to insult my wife shew me your warrant and send for the  most eminent attorney in your place you have neither to treat with fools nor beggars  'I beg your pardon 'squire Hewit' said the gaoler 'I always knows how to treat they that have money to spend As for you ma'am I beg your pardon too but I'll be damned if I don't think you as handsome a bit of goods as ever I saw for all that let your husband be ever so much affronted I wish you may get clear of the business for I knows some of the clan and if what I heard yesterday should be but true the brother of a certain lady in my eye as the parliament men says in their debates stands a good chance if he don't mind his hits of dancing upon nothing'  I told him I had no doubt but that his intentions were perfectly handsome and proper that to be sure in a situation like that people could expect no favour but  in proportion as they paid their way that fortunately we did not want money and all the service required of the attorney at present would be to move my husband by a habeas corpus into the Fleet where my brother was with whom we should like to consult as we were all embarked as it were in a common cause  We had truly described our situation to the gaoler for in case of this very emergency we had laid by fifty pounds as a deposit to extricate us from all difficulty As for Walmesley as the seven debts he stood engaged for contracted by Douce amounted to no more than eleven pounds the sum he had been taken in execution for by virtue of a warrant of attorney given to one man in trust for the whole which he had the cunning to manage in order to avoid multiplying the costs we compounded them set him free and sent him forward to London  Thus after waiting all the necessary ceremonies and being treated very liberally by the gaoler who had a regard for my elder brother because he had shewn some civility to a Bristol turnkey who afterwards turned sailor and a rooted dislike to my other brother who had promised to protect a friend of his a king's evidence and afterwards got him transported we came to an anchor as my brother called it in his Majesty's Fleet on the th of March  Walmesley who was waiting for us at the gate said that they had discovered a plot First said he it must be a plot because there is a lawyer in it secondly it must be a plot because there is a Jew in it thirdly it must be a plot because there is a parliament man in it and fourthly it must be a plot because'You stupid fellow you don't know what to make of it'  said my brother who came up as Walmesley was speaking  'Hannah my dear girl' continued he 'how are you Jack give us your hand come with me I have something to tell you I think we shall get afloat if we keep a good look out'  We went with my brother into his room where he gave us the following intelligence A parliament man who was considerably in debt had reason to believe that a Jew to whom he was under many and material obligations would on a disolution of parliament endeavour to secure his person on an execution under an idea that during the suspension the person of a member of parliament was not inviolable  This gentleman's apprehensions were well grounded for he was stopt getting  into his chaise to set out for his Borough and the Jew having indemnified the officers they carried him to a Spunginghouse As there was no parliament to apply to and his interest in the Borough began so to totter that he would certainly have lost his seat if he had not been present finding the Jew inexorable he commissioned my brother the lawyer and Sourby to tamper with him giving them the best security he could find in the minority on which side he happened to be for five hundred pounds to be paid on the day of his being returned to parliament  They knew that tampering with the Jew like dipping red hot iron in cold water would only harden him the more They therefore forged in his name an order to the sheriff's officer to liberate the gentleman who availing himself of the opportunity not the fraud for he did not know one word of that stole down to the  Borough was reelected and thus his person became as sacred as ever  The moment the newspapers announced the return of the new parliament and our gentleman as one of the members the Jew instantly went to consult his attorney as to how far he could answer to keep him in the custody of the sheriff where he thought he still had him secure but when he found that his enlargement was nefariously procured at a time when his person was as attachable as the person of any body else both he and the attorney were clearly of opinion that he might go against the sheriff  Searching further however it became evident that neither the sheriff nor the member had been to blame The first or rather his officer having acted in conformity as far as he knew with the Jew's own order and the other so far from  being accessary to the fraud on his return to town had thanked him for his indulgence and assured him that as soon as the ministry changed he would honourably discharge every demand against him  Upon a minuter enquiry he found that my brother the lawyer and Sourby was at the bottom of it but he knew their characters so well that he had no doubt if the matter was to be investigated they would both swear to save themselves that he signed the order in their presence He therefore contented himself with getting it returned to him and making no further stir about it for the present  It so happened that the character of this Jew was of a peculiar cast His common conduct was like the common conduct of his brethren He enriched himself by taking advantage of folly but he appropriated his gains by the strict line of true wisdom He preyed upon vice to  relieve virtue The riches he wrung from villany he lavished on goodness and while he was publickly execrated as a Jew and a devil he was privately adored as a christian and an angel He was in gross what Walmesley was in little and though he did not go to prison to exonerate his friends he had his Dick Douces whom he often came into prison to relieve  It has sometimes struck me that such a character would do well for the stage such a man without ostentation without egotism beneficent without parade noble with humility never the hero of his own little tale seeking no praise but the testimony of his own heart a miser in virtue not in money though no novelty I trust in nature would certainly be one to the drama  One kind action liberally rewarded sometimes makes amends for many which  are returned by ingratitude This happened in the present case My elder brother who had toiled and risked every thing for his owners was thrown into prison for his pains He had on that very voyage done a common act of humanity to this Jew and mark the difference The christians had plunged him into distress and obloquy the Jew the moment he heard of his situation meditated how he might relieve him Nay it was from him as the reader probably has guessed that he received the hundred pounds  The circumstance was this The Jew and his family having embarked from Smyrna for England their ship caught fire at sea It so happened that my brother was near enough in his ship to lend him assistance and so well did his inclination stimulate his exertions that what with his boats and their own though the ship burnt to the water's edge very few lives were  lost and much more of the property was saved than they had the smallest reason to expect  The Jew his family and his property were saved My brother was not at that time bound for England he therefore put them all on board another Strieghtsman and wished them a good voyage refusing to accept any gratuity his services having been occasioned by mere chance and performed from motives of common humanity  The circumstance however had never from that moment escaped the Jew who when he came to find upon examining the business of the forgery to the bottom that my brother the lawyer and Sourby had been indirectly concerned in my brother's ship and were a part of that nest who had sent him to prison he was determined to procure him ample redress  Little indeed did he know till that accidental discovery which was not astonishing usurers and other nefarious characters frequently consulting him as one of their own clan that his benefactor was languishing in a prison through the connivance of his own brother His determination was prompt and efficacious He first took care to prove by unquestionable testimony that he had not been in town on the day the order was signed to release the member of parliament He then sent for my brother and Sourby upon an errand that induced them readily to attend and told them in so many words that they must release my brother from prison or he would not only hang them both for forgery but that he would so completely break up their gang that they should never dare to shew their faces again in the kingdom  In short he knew what sort of argument  to use and he succeded but before he lost sight of them he exacted a conditional bond to the amount of the monies for which my brother was imprisoned to be forfeited if they did not procure his enlargement by a given day  With this news the Jew had on the morning we arrived acquainted my brother who informing him how we had been used he declared that he would take care in the settling of the business to include us in the treaty  Many days had not elapsed before my brother and Hewit were discharged from confinement and now general releases passed between all parties that had been either immediately or collaterally concerned in any of the transactions  CHAP VII THE SEA OF HANNAH's FORTUNE HAVING BECOME CALM APPEARS GRADUALLY TO BE AGITATED SHE MEETS UNEXPECTEDLY WITH AN OLD FRIEND WHO SHE HAS SCARCELY SPOKEN TO WHEN JOHN AND SHE ARE OBLIGED TO TAKE SHELTER IN FLIGHT  WE had now the world to begin again As for my brother through the interest of the Jew he got to be secondmate of an EastIndiaman with such recommendations as were sure to procure him the command of a ship in the country service on his arrival and as it was probable he would soon have a good deal in his power at his earnest entreaty I trusted my son to his care  As for ourselves Hewit got to be  foreman to a capital tin man and I was furnished with as much work in various ways from shops as I could perform and as for poor Walmesley he soon after embarked for Ireland in consequence of a liberal offer made him by the manager of the Dublin Theatre and the last thing we heard of him was that he died in consequence of a cold he had caught by lending his bed to accommodate a family in distress  I own I dropt a tear of the most poignant regret at this news and thinking on all his various quotations which were so apt and had so much of the heart in them I exclaimed 'Alas poor Walmesley he had a mind mild as mercy and a hand open as day for tender hearted charity'  In this situation we went on pretty comfortably and lived so saving that in less than six months we furnished a very snug house and having experienced all  the vicissitudes of high and low life we were now placed in a middle state that state said to be of all others the most to be coveted  I cannot say however that I found any alteration in the world It was still the same vain supercilious ridiculous world I had ever known it and the middle state by standing between the two extremities affecting the hauteur of the one and embibing the vulgarity of the other exhibited such a strange mixture of pride and meanness such an incongruous collection of finery and filth such a heterogenious pyeballed jumble of patch work gentility that it seemed to be both and neither like a magpie standing between a crow and a swan  I could have been extremely well content nevertheless in this situation had fortune ceased to torment us and had my husband been always with me It is true  when he came home to dinner or at night absence gave a zest to our meetings but then we had always some little unpleasant matter to talk over and among the rest our troubles like embers half extinguished began now and then to shew a disposition to rekindle  When men are involved in partnerships and in the habit of signing notes whether on their own account or to accommodate others there is no answering for their safety One litigation begets another till they are so involved that no fortune can make a stand against the various attacks of cunning and chicanery  Many things of this kind stood out against us which certainly the general releases had virtually done away but having been improvident enough not to take them up they got into various hands and we were perpetually pestered with persons who tendered them for payment It is  true a court of justice would have relieved us but who is there that does not find even winning at law a severe loss A man sued us upon one of these notes for twenty pounds he was cast but having thrown himself into the King's Bench we had our own attorney's bill to pay which came to seventeen pounds  These things brought us into every kind of disgrace our friends began as formerly to look cool upon us we were afraid of our own shadows and it was once more thought expedient to consider what to do to avoid a prison Hewit proposed following my brother to India where he said we should certainly do great things but this proposal I strenuously resisted nor could I ever think of it without shuddering therefore at last he left off urging it At length as nothing could prevent our doing extremely well if we could once be free we determined to  muster all the money we could and go to France in order that Hewit might take the benefit of the next act of insolvency as a fugitive  We were in great forwardness when our operations were retarded by the sickness of our little girl whose disorder a violent fever after I had been her nurse for a fortnight baffled every skill and she died in my arms  As this melancholy event had prevented me from finishing some work for which I was to be very well paid I was obliged as soon as possible to labour with redoubled assiduity and this together with the despondency into which I was thrown at losing my child brought on a complaint on my spirits which I very much feared would be attended with serious consequences  As I grew better Hewit did the utmost  in his power to keep up my spirits and among the rest frequently took me to the play where we were sometimes accompanied by a lady who had shewn me a great deal of attention and who though there was certainly a sort of levity about her that was at times not strictly proper had something extremely engaging and good natured in her manner  This lady was a widow her name was Vint She had a relation who had a concern in one of the Theatres and thus she could get orders whenever she pleased Hewit and I therefore availed ourselves of this privilege and in return she passed a good deal of time at our house which on account of her sprightly temper was very agreeable to John and indeed to me as she had a most happy knack of laughing off that particular chagrin occasioned by pecuniary distress  We had all three settled it to go to a new play but Hewit having received a message to call upon an attorney who he always kept upon the look out to watch whenever any immediate danger threatened said he feared he could not be in time for us and therefore begged we would go telling us that he would find us at the theatre I drank tea with Mrs Vint and we went from her house together No Hewit however came at which indeed I was no farther concerned than at the loss of his company and lest his business with the lawyer should have turned out of a more serious nature than he had expected  The play being over as we were waiting in the lobby while a friend of Mrs Vint was gone in quest of a coach I thought I saw in the croud a man I knew At the same moment I caught his eye and he seemed to know me Approaching each other I cried out "Gracious Heaven  Mr Binns' and he almost in the same instant reiterated 'Is it possible that I see my dear Hannah' "I declare" cried I "I never was so surprized and so pleased in my life How is your sister" 'She is married my love' said Binns 'and as for me' but seeing every one looking at us in a state of astonishment 'I cannot' added he 'explain any thing here it would interest you too much besides I have company with me Where do you live' I gave him my address made him promise to come to me the next day and as at that moment the gentleman returned with intelligence that the coach was ready we went towards the door and lost him in the croud  I sat Mrs Vint down at her house and bid the coachman make all the haste he could to mine for surprized as I was at seeing Binns I was still impatient to see Hewit But this was to be a night of  astonishment I found every thing packed up in readiness to be sent away  Hewit who was in the parlour with a broker told me that an annuity bond to which I knew he had signed his name as security had become forfeited and the news the attorney wanted to inform him of was that the next day an execution would be brought into the house for two hundred and seventy pounds In consequence of this not having a moment to lose he had sent for a broker had sold every thing to him and had received the money He added that our cloaths were packed up a chaise was in readiness and that he meant if possible to reach Dover by the morning with a view to embark for France lest they should change their ground and sue out a writ of execution against his person  As we had determined to take this  step as soon as it should be convenient and necessity now left the time no longer a matter of choice I consented with alacrity and in three days we were safely landed at Calais  CHAP VIII A DESCRIPTION OF THE FRENCH HANNAH'S PREDICTION SHE RETURNS TO ENGLAND A TEMPORARY CALM IS SUCCEEDED BY FAMILY DISQUIET WHICH TERMINATES IN A FATAL SEPARATION  HAVING sufficient money to last us with oeconomy while it was probable we might remain in France I was determined as I had no other employ to make myself a proficient in the language and lay up in my mind a store of literature which indeed was of so much service to me that it perfectly and completely supplied for me the place of a regular classical education  I perfected myself also in one study  more which was so obvious and so necessary that it was impossible to avoid it I mean a study of the people and their manners and now it was that I saw if the world was faulty in my own country how much the term ought to be magnified speaking of France  Go where I would I found nothing but human wolves disguising their natural ferocity with the grimace of monkies At market in a shop whatever was the comodity its commendation was sweetened with some gross compliment to induce the purchase of it Either your gown was a handsome pattern your hair was a beautiful colour and then you were English that was enough meaning it was enough to afford them an opportunity of cheating you and laughing at you at the same time  Among one another the subtilty was  more refined All had some artful point to carry and to gloss over Thus a  bon mot  hid a design a  Jeux d'esprit  covered a  manoeuvre  and a  coup de vivacite  concealed a  coup de grace  for the more brilliant the wit the more pointed the sally the more it resembled the gleam that precedes the stroke of a lifted dagger  But the most shocking trait of their dissimulation was their affecting to believe in a religion which in secret they laughed at This went to the root of all social order for to impose upon each other what no one credited was in its nature such a blasphemy and begat such a rooted hypocrisy that neighbour could not be safe with neighbour  Oh how I have contemplated this people Specious guarded fawning fraudful faithless volatile sanguinary and merciless and these qualities they put off to strangers for openness carefulness  breeding prudence vivacity gallantry courage and greatness In short I found a Frenchman an animated lie that should be reversed to be understood Alas said I these were the Gauls that were so faithless to Caesar What are they now that they have added to their native ferocity consummate art I tremble for their country I dread lest in one horrible moment the French nation memorable for crime memorable for treachery memorable for barbarity shall undergo a tremendous internal convulsion and that like Etna it shall vomit forth its own bowels to desolate the country around  I saw the Court of France I saw it in the moment of its most splendid brilliancy It was when the Emperor was there to solicit the hand of the King's sister But he never married her That man contemplated the country as I did He thought probably an alliance with it  might endanger his own crown He saw there could be no security where there was no honour no stability where there was no sincerity He saw his own sister the puppet of that court He saw it and lamented it Poor splendid beautiful amiable unhappy wretch falsely deified by designing men whose ambitious views were to make her beauty their bait to lure her to destruction  Among the foremost of these was that horrid wretch the Duke D'Orleans He who introduced English noblemen and other foreigners to the Queen and afterwards like a low backbiter whispered away her reputation He who converted his countrymen from monkies to bears by making them ape English grooms I should not wonder if that man destroyed his country by the hands of villains and that those villains should make his carcase the foot stool of their power  Among this frivolous this contemptible this proud this mean this arrogant this supercilious people we resided nearly a year and a half during which time I saw no one single instance that could induce me to retract an iota of that ineffable pity and sovereign contempt which every day's experience of them excited There may have been virtuous individuals and no doubt there were it did not fall to my lot to know them But I'll give a reason why I suspect there were fewer in France than any where  The high are too tyranic the low are too servile and yet they are the same creature the lord oppresses his vassal the vassal domineers over his labourer the labourer beats his dog and the dog worries his rat yet each turns back in resentment Every Frenchman knows every thing better than any body is a better calculator a better politician a better lawyer a better ruler than any  body and I should not wonder if upon the same principal that tinsel and calamanco ape fattin and lace among them that should ever a revolution take place in that devoted country which for the sake of Europe of the world of human nature may Heaven avert should order be destroyed virtue confounded religion anihilated the crown trampled under foot and riot anarchy and massacre reign triumphant it would be accomplished by the lowest dregs of the people who would lord it and tyrannize over the rest  In June we arrived in town and in two months from that time John Hewit took the benefit of an act of insolvency that had lately passed which step as he had no debts that he could legally consider as his own his friends one and all commended  I could not however reconcile him cordially to it He considered it as a  disgrace and though we began to get forward his former master having taken him again as his foreman and the shops being ready as formerly to supply me with work yet his continual cry was that he did not like to have his name recorded among a set of swindlers and others who had defrauded honest tradesmen out of their legal demands  Besides to clinch this business some of our creditors from vexatious motives were determined to litigate their claims with us These I began to be afraid were set on by my brother the lawyer and Sourby and to make all sure the annuity business still stood out against us except as to Hewit's person for though the act cleared him up to the time of its date yet it gave no relief as to property acquired afterwards  As this kept us perpetually at law with either beggars or rogues which always  cost us something and as our fears were more than imaginary relative to the annuity I really could not blame Hewit's uneasiness and at last indeed I began to make myself quite wretched about it He grew melancholy his temper was soured he lost his health and though he certainly loved me tenderly when I have ventured to carress him he would sometimes received me coldly while a tear stood in his eye  Formerly a wish expressed in a hint accelerated his endeavours to oblige and please me now there seemed to be something unreasonable in all I wished I had informed him of course of my interview with Binns in the lobby of the playhouse at which time he expressed an anxiety to know what he could mean now when I proposed setting about an enquiry how we might find him and indeed I had taken some steps towards it it was all wrong What had we to do with Binns Perhaps  he belonged to the gang of rascals who persecuted us but Binns was such a gallant protector that no wonder I was constantly thinking of him  It had been his delight to fondle a sweet girl that fortune blessed me with about eight months after we arrived in France now he could not bear the sight of the little creature This I own grieved me to the soul which very grief became now an offence I certainly paid the child additional attention for his neglect of it I offended in that I was always thinking of nonsense when we ought to consider what was to become of us  This was hard and it was not at all in the style of John Hewit It was unkind and almost unmanly It was something like jealousy but that was impossible for he never in his life had a moment's cause for suspicion of me It seemed to be a sort of trial of my affection as if he wished to  excite jealousy in me but that was equally impossible I knew him to be all soul all honour and though I had been told a hundred idle stories when we were in prosperity when in adversity when in midling life when in France nay even since we returned my sense of affection was that I ought to have been deprived of his love for ever if I could have been so cruelly ungenerous as to have suspected it  I could not help thinking now and then that he had some adviser but who could it be Nobody came near us but that thoughtless goodnatured creature Mrs Vint who sought us out soon after our arrival in town and from that time occasionally visited us and as to her though out of complaisance he behaved civilly before her face I believe in my conscience he disliked her most heartily Nay when in a moment of affection for me from which he could not sometimes refrain and at which time he  would treat me as if his conduct was a reparation for some offence meditated or committed he would declare that no woman upon earth ever loved or deserved to be loved but me  If it were proper minutely to dwell upon this part of my history I should exhibit perhaps the most extraordinary and affecting picture of domestic disquiet that ever was drawn Tender anxious solicitous expostulations on my part sullen moody reserved coldness on his Yet he loved me tenderly loved me his whole conduct was love and indeed in the end I had fatal cause to know it  I had one evening prepared a ragout for his supper which I had learnt to cook in France where of course I perfected myself in culinary knowledge and had waited considerably beyond his usual hour of returning when somebody knocked at  the door My heart fluttered for I had determined on that evening to come to an explanation with him and I believe I should have fainted if I had not drank a glass of Madeira a wine I always made a point of indulging him with  My apprehensions however were more excited by the fear of what would happen than the knowledge of what did It was not Hewit it was Mrs Vint who said she had been at the play and had come without ceremony to eat a bit of supper with us then turning round she expressed her astonishment at not seeing He wit  I said he was not come home but that I expected him every moment at which she said husbands were strange things she had had one but would never have another She then talked of the play then asked me if I did not remember that she and I were there together at the time we  saw Binns if I did not think him a handsome fellow 'indeed' said she 'by his raptures I should have thought you had been old sweethearts Do you know I have often thought Hewit's sulkiness looked liked jealousy of that man What he might know of him formerly I cannot tell but it must be contemptible indeed to fly out so about a single interview and in the presence of five hundred people  As I never condescended to complain to any one of my husband so I did not chuse to enter into any conversation on the subject I therefore waved her rattling inquisitive hints by telling her she was a giddy creature and that I was sure she knew better how to do justice to every body than seriously to entertain any such absurd suspicions  She begged my pardon said to be sure it was no business of hers and desired we might have the supper for that she was  hungry and could plainly see it would be useless to wait for Hewit Out of complaisance I set it before her for it was past twelve o'clock and she are heartily for my own part I could eat nothing As time wore so our surprize encreased and at last the clock struck two and no Hewit All this while she had grown warmer and warmer in her exclamations against him for his treatment of me till at length she appeared to be a little intoxicated to which failing having a weak head she certainly was now and then addicted and as there was nobody to see her home which Hewit usually did I persuaded her to go to bed after which I sat counting the hours till day light in vain expectation of my husband  It was now nine o'clock I had just refreshed myself with a dish of tea Mrs Vint was yet sleeping when the people of the house brought me a letter which they told me was delivered by a porter who  went away saying it required no answer The letter was from Hewit and the sensation I felt on opening it was like the stroke of death  This letter informed me that he was then underweigh aboard an EastIndiaman that he was perfectly convinced I held a criminal intercourse with Binns that he went upon proof that he knew of our having had frequent interviews and his evidence went as far as to substantiate that Binns was the father of the child which in France he had fondly imagined to be his He added that though he was determined never to see me again for he could not stomach living with an adulttress his love for me was unceasing that it had become so violent it was at last unsafe for him to trust himself in my presence and that if his religion had not got the better of his madness I should not have lived long to wrong him for he had  more than once meditated to murder me in my sleep He concluded by recommending me wicked as I was to the care of providence and hoping whatever became of him God would bless and prosper me but he feared I could not expect to prosper after making so good a husband miserable  With a trembling frame my heart sunk within me sick with wretchedness and petrified with astonishment did I persevere till I came to the end of this fatal paper It seemed a delusion a mockery of that imagination which had maddened into a thousand phantasies during the tedious night in which I had watched and amused myself with inventing a thousand excuses for the strange conduct of that deluded wretch the cause of all my misery and his own  It was with the utmost difficulty I could  go through it Line after line my impatience my astonishment my wretchedness and my despair increased At length seeing and indeed feeling most forcibly most fatally most horribly the pressure of the finger of fate I shuddered with agony and fell lifeless on the floor  CHAP IX HANNAH'S DISTRESS THE FATE OF LAWYER HIGGINS AND SOURBY HANNAH DEPARTS FOR INDIA SEES HER BROTHER THE CAPTAIN REEMBARKS IN THE GROSVENOR AND IS CAST AWAY UPON THE COAST OF AFRICA  WHEN I came to myself I was surrounded by the people of the house and Mrs Vint who gave me the letter and told me to take care of it When I grew sufficiently recovered to explain myself I accounted for what had happened by saying that the satigue of sitting up all night in anxiety on account of my husband and my unexpectedly receiving a letter which convinced me he was safe had I supposed oceasioned  a sensation which had thrown me into the condition they had seen but that I was now perfectly well  Mrs Vint said I was too good to live in this world and after the people of the house had gone down told me she had read the letter and plainly saw that my husband was a villain I could not bear this but did not chuse to enter into an explanation of my sensations which were dictated by a delicacy Mrs Vint was little calculated to feel neither did I like her having taken the liberty to read the letter Indeed one part of my reflections during the night had been on the subject of this lady who though inoffensively I dared say had always been too prying I therefore under the pretense of wanting rest and my incapacity of holding any conversation on so peculiar a subject prevailed on her to retire and having done so I resolved in future to have as little communication with her as possible  In the mean time it was necessary to have some friend and it instantly struck me that as interest is a surer inducement with mankind to assist one another than any call upon their friendship or tye upon their gratitude so I thought I had hit on the very person to execute any trust I should repose in him with strict rectitude and scrupulous fidelity  It was a person of the name of Morris who had employed me to paint fan mounts paper snuff boxes enamelled watch cases and sleeve buttons He had a wife who though she never asked me to sit down always when I brought home my work took a glass of cherry brandy herself and begged me to take another probably because she knew I should refuse and these people though I had not the smallest expectation that they would advance an insecure sixpence to keep me from starving I was sure if I would give up my whole time to them and afford them a lumping pennyworth  would keep my secret inviolably and protect me most sacredly from all persecution Besides I wished my exact story to be known by some family of credit which they really were by way of evidence in my favour if it should be necessary hereafter  Having made my resolution I took some repose then I went to these people and fairly told them my story proposing that while I sat myself down in a lodging near town they should report that I had gone abroad which would make it a better thing for them at it would enhance the value of those things I might furnish them with Finding they should have my exclusive labours they gave into every thing and I must in justice declare that having already given me about the fourth of what I ought to have been paid they did not so far take advantage of my present necessities as to beat me down in any one article I offered them and during the time I  stayed in England nothing could be more sacredly kept than was my secret  Nay they did every thing they could secretly to get at Hewit with a view to expostulate with him and the good woman who certainly had a most excellent opinion of me for said she 'industrous people are never bad' assured me if she could find him she would have his life out if he did not do me justice adding 'fine airs indeed just like my husband once when we had a handsome apprentice but I made him buckle to I soon brought his nose to the grindstone' All they could do however was of no use for the Vansitart which was the last ship of that season from whence he dated his letter had sailed before they could make any enquiries and it being now six months before another fleet was to go out I had no chance of following him even had I ability to do so  Mr and Mrs Morris approved very  much of my design of breaking off with Mrs Vint saying which I have no doubt was nothing but scandal that they had heard but a so soish character of her I had now taken a lodging at Brumpton and I earned of Mr Morris about fifty shillings a week more than half of which I regularly saved to lay up against a rainy day  I had continued in this situation about three months when one morning having taken up a newspaper I found to my great astonishment that my brother the lawyer was condemned to death for forgery and that Sourby as his accomplice though not on account of some law nicety implicated capitally was sentenced to be transported for life  This sickened me of my native country and when I reflected that Hewit was gone to India where both he and my brother  had often pressed me to try my fortune though I never thought of the subject but I turned as cold as ice and the sweat ran off my forehead I almost made up my mind to embark with the next fleet upon this idea that if I found Hewit and could appease his causeless anger I might yet be happy with him if not I should be sure to meet with a brother the only friend on earth able and willing to defend me and a son who might in duty compensate for his father's cruelty and neglect  While I was wavering on this subject like one wishing to plunge into a salutary bath yet afraid of being drowned my beautiful little girl and heaven knows Hewit's beautiful little girl the only vestige of him now left me first sickened and soon after died I now grew so melancholy so sick of disappointment so heart broken and so completely let down that I was ready to follow to whenever  Fate should think proper to beckon To be brief I immediately advertised as a companion to any lady of fortune going to India and having given a reference to Mr Morris who gave me a most excellent character I sailed in the spring of the year and arrived in something less than eight months at my brother's house in Surat  He happened to be just arrived from a long voyage and after a most affectionate welcome which unused as I was to kindness overcame me with delight and melted me into gratitude I soon learnt that he knew my affairs as well as I knew them myself He shewed me three letters from Hewit which though dated and sent at different times he had received all together  The first of these letters in a most manly manner delicately and feelingly  opened my supposed ill conduct appealed to him how I ought to be treated acknowledged he was broken hearted and that he never should have taken the resolution to part with me but from the fullest conviction and the dread of what his violent love might have hurried him to He finished with saying he should immediately fly to him as the only friend with whom he could expect to find consolation in such a delicate and wretched situation  In the second letter he informed my brother that he had missed of the Vansitart Missed of her said I then if I had been industrious I might have found him out and convinced him of his errors The letter went on saying that he was confirmed in his former suspicions for that he had scarcely turned his back when I went off publickly with Binns and that I was at that time living with him in  Ireland That he had sent that letter by the Packet and he should positively embark himself by the next fleet  The third letter contradicted the other two He said my brother the lawyer had sent for him when he was under sentence of death in Newgate and had lain open a most iniquitous scene of villainy He was now convinced I was perfectly innocent and he had laboured in every possible way to find me out and make me amends and among the rest had inserted several advertisements in the newspapers drawn up in the most penitent and contrite terms He said this letter was written in a hurry but that he should write again fully as soon as he should get any intelligence and as he had already learnt that I was in an obscure lodging somewhere near town he had no doubt of sending in his next the satisfactory  intelligence of having found and being reconciled to the most amiable and most injured of wives  I was all anxiety now to get back 'Avast avast' said my brother 'we must talk this matter over cooly To be sure if he should hear of your taking this trip and follow you it would be awkward enough but even then it is but a trip home again at worst and Jack Hewit does not mind a little weather  'I will tell you how it is with me I must sail in a fortnight for the Coast of Coromandel with a freight and after that I am going upon a commission from the Nabob across the Red Sea to Grand Cairo which I think is the last voyage I shall make for thank God good friends and my own industry I am now grown pretty warm If therefore you have a mind to trust yourself with me I  have no doubt but either on our way at Madrass or some other port I can put you on board an Indiaman bound for Europe If not and you should think it more feasible to stay here are my premises house lascars palanquin every thing at your service till either my return which by the way will be three years or the arrival of Hewit  I expressed a very ardent wish to see my son but this he told me was impossible for that he was situated in a very good employ at Benares and that we should not be at any time within five hundred miles of him He assured me he was perfectly well was very much respected and in a way to get rich I therefore contented myself with writing him a long letter full of maternal tenderness and containing advice suitable to his time of life tending to ensure his happiness and accelerate his expectations  Upon deliberate consideration it was agreed that I should return and with this idea I embarked on board my brother's ship Our voyage was adverse and we were driven into Tricomalee just as the Grosvenor was preparing to sail My brother happening to know captain Coxson her commander perfectly well he took me aboard with great willingness and promised me every possible accommodation  We dined on board and a fair wind springing up we sailed the next day I burst into a flood of tears at parting with my brother which he treated as a joke 'Good bye Hannah' said he 'I am going over the Red Sea to search for the spirits that are laid there And if I should fish up one of the wheels of Pharoah's chariot with the fluke of my anchor I'll send it for a present to some of the gaminghouses near St James's'  In short after settling all matters as to Hewit and every thing else we parted He in the highest good humour and I in the most pitiable depression of spirits which continued from that day the th of June till the th of August when the Grosvenor was shipwrecked between latitude and on the Coast of Africa  END OF THE THIRD BOOK  HANNAH HEWIT  BOOK IV THE ADVENTURES OF HANNAH HEWIT FROM THE TIME SHE WAS SHIPWRECKED TO THE MOST MISERABLE PERIOD OF HER LIFE  CHAP I SOME ACCOUNT OF THE DREADFUL DISTRESS EXPERIENCED BY THE PASSENGERS AND CREW OF THE GROSVENOR EASTINDIAMAN  THE moment the ship struck a universal panic pervaded the whole company as if conveyed by an electrical shock That  fatal blow was the knell of many perhaps of all there except me or if any survived if they encountered so many hardships as I did unless their minds were as well fitted to the trial better indeed had it been for them to have died at that moment  In the confusion as it is usual I suppose upon such occasions every precaution was taken improperly The carpenters attempted to sound the pumps when it was impossible to find water which had run entirely forward owing to the stern's lying high upon the rocks Signals of distress were next ordered to be fired but had common sense been consulted they would have known that owing to the water they could not get to the powderroom  In this delemma what should have been done first was done last but not till the experiment was ineffectual I mean  cutting away the masts which expedient had it been adopted before the vessel had struck so hard and so often by the stern as to wedge herself as it were among the rocks the wind now coming to blow off the land she would certainly have righted though perhaps with considerable damage  Every precaution finding all other hope at an end was now taken to convey the crew and the passengers ashore A raft was formed and launched but it proved as ineffectual an attempt as the rest for the hawser to which it was fastened broke and five men were drowned  Four expert sailors now attempted to swim ashore conducting with them the deep sea line with a view to convey a larger line and then a larger still in order that the people might be borne upon it so as to reach the shore in safety  Another expedient was to hoist out the yawl and the jolly boat but this answered no better purpose than any of the former for the surf curling in between the pointed fragments of the rocks instantly dashed them both to pieces  But none of these methods could apply to the safety of any others than expert sailors the passengers and particularly the ladies must inevitably have perished had it not been for a most unexpected and providental circumstance by means of which every soul that then remained got on shore without the smallest difficulty  The wind chopping directly about and blowing right on the shore the bows which were loose from the rock being heavy and choaked with water strained considerably and the vessel having nearly broken her back she fairly snapt in two immediately before the main mast  The after part having less to struggle with and being of course considerably lighter in consequence of being disencumbered of the bows began by the force of the wind and the undulating motion of the surge which made to the land to be lifted forwards Striking however frequently as this part of wreck edged in a severe shock tore the deck fairly asunder by which means as on a raft that part nearest the shore floated into shoal water and every creature except I believe about four were saved  We had every prospect that the shore where we had taken shelter would not prove a very hospitable one for the inhabitants constantly plundered us and when we resisted beat us My foreboding heart which always too fatally anticipated my sufferings had in the midst of my distraction providently dictated to me to  supply myself with whatever might be useful to me in any emergency I had therefore carefully concealed about me two knives two pair of scissars a housewife very well stocked pins and a few other things and having besides made a parade of buckles earrings and other trinkets they contented themselves with plundering me of what was visible and left my concealed stock unmollested  We remained a long time undetermined as to what measures we should pursue but after a variety of consultations we resolved to traverse the country in hopes at length to fall in with some of the Dutch settlements  This attempt was attended with various success We passed at first from village to village with but little difficulty but as we advanced our troubles increased The natives plundered us and if we approached  the woods we were terrified not only with the roarings but the sight of wild beasts and in short surrounded with so many and such complicated difficulties and inconveniencies that though they were little to those I have sustained since my heart sinks within me at the remembrance of them  At length our misfortunes mastered our patience and instead of enduring with resignation what could not be avoided we inveighed against each other for the fruitless advice every one had given The sailors swore that if it had not been for the obstancy of the captain in not taking proper observations the ship would never have gone ashore Some advised going back to the wreck others to live in the best manner we could while a party of the most enterprising should go forward and give notice to the Dutch settlers who in hopes of a reward from the English  EastIndia Company would of course send to our relief  These discontents were augmented by their receiving information from a man supposed to be a Malayan that it would be impossible to accomplish what they attempted This man who called himself Trout met us two or three times and seemed very anxious as to what was to become of us I had noticed him very little myself though it is plain I had not escaped his observation  He was represented as a man who had been guilty of several murders in his own country and had therefore taken shelter among the Caffres where he was settled and had a wife and a child This alone was quite enough to deter me from paying him much attention but his sallow face his lank black hair and his wild looks in which there was an uncommon  ferocity perfectly disgusted me though I could not help thinking I had somewhere seen a resemblance of him and notwithstanding he spoke Dutch which language I did not understand I imagined I had at sometime or other heard his voice  This man having widened the unhappy breach among us in a few days it was resolved that the captain's party should take one route and the rest another The mates the surgeon the passengers and in short all the genteeler part of the company made their election to stay with the captain and what became of the rest I am entirely ignorant of and indeed of those except one with whom I was left for it was my fate though perhaps my life was preserved by it to be torne from my companions shortly afterwards in the manner I shall relate in its place  The man who called himself Trout  had met us three several times What passed at these meetings the ladies knew nothing of but by report for we were now so bare of necessaries that it was scarcely decent for us to be seen We therefore walked at a distance from the men and when they found any refreshment they left it and we went and fetched it when they were out of sight  When night concealed our shame we conversed together and at those opportunities we learnt that this man had come to treat with us from the natives who said that if we would submit to be their servants till we were redeemed by the Dutch they would send an express to the settlers describing our situation and informing them of our quality after which we should be delivered whenever we were demanded and in the mean time we should experience very mild and kind treatment  We journeyed on in the track we were directed but heard no more of the negociation One morning we missed one of the carpenter's mates whose name was M'Daniel and as we had heard the roaring of wild beasts in the night we conjectured he had been carried off and torne to pieces  Our distresses and apprehensions now hourly encreased Treachery from the natives destruction from famished wolves lions and tygers raging hunger we could not appease and parching thirst which we were obliged to allay in the most shocking and unnatural manner menaced us in such horrid and various forms that we seemed like so many devoted wretches waiting for death as the only kind friend we could implore to terminate our shocking and degrading miseries  Surely surely human nature never  suffered such deplorable humiliation A set of fine sensible gallant men and handsome elegant educated women reduced to a state more filthy than brutes Their resolution conquered their intellects impaired their strength exhausted their hopes destroyed In the course of a few days shrunk decayed and emaciated all loveliness defaced all delicacy confounded For this thought I did we seek the voluptuous luxury of the East For this in our sloating palace did we command the winds to waft us with propitious gales to our expecting friends But it is just Inordinate pleasure terminates in pain and extravagant hope is baulked by disappointment  I cannot say however that my observation exactly applied to myself In going to India I had no pride to gratify no splendor to indulge in nor  did I contemplate the satisfaction I should receive on my return at being gazed on as a meteor and held up as a prodigy of beauty wit and elegance though the glaring medium of a galaxy of diamonds  CHAP II HANNAH PARTS FOR EVER FROM HER COMPANIONS IN AFFLICTION THE CAUSE OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY SEPARATION SOME CURIOUS PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO TROUT AND AN AWFUL INSTANCE OF THE JUSTICE OF PROVIDENCE  I Do not mean in my last observations to cast any reflections on my unhappy companions The moment of wretchedness is but an ill time for the language of admonition and if it were a proper one never was it so little necessary as upon the present occasion I declare my heart bleeds within me when I think of the probable fate of such ornaments of their sex as Mrs James Miss Hosea  Miss Wilmot Miss Dennis and other ladies who had the misfortune to be shipwrecked in the Grosvenor  I only meant to remark that these ladies having fallen from a greater height than I did and their disappointment as to their future prospects being more elevated than mine neither my mind was so conquered nor my body so impaired as theirs Indeed if I could not account for it the superior health and I almost said spirits I was in would not be credited but as it is my disposition upon all occasions to be provident so the precautions I adopted from the first moment of coming ashore served to prepare me for all I was to suffer  These precautions I could not prevail on any body else to take If there was any thing to eat they would eat voraciously If what we had was merely a resource it was despised Thus by sucking  gums chewing the pith of a tree extracting juice from leaves keeping perpetually a stone in my mouth especially if it contained any saline or nutritious quality were very salutary resources to me though for a long time I could not prevail on them to follow my example and when they wished to have followed it we were in too dreary a part of the country to find the means  I was as unfortunate in the resource I had provided by hoarding up a little stock of necessaries When we came to be in great extremity I shared it with them to the last article but they were so careless or rather so lost in consequence of their distresses that the inhabitants with ease discovered their hoard and plundered them so that all that remained of it was what I had now left in my possession consisting of a knise and a pincase with some pins which serve me to reckon the days  I here mention these matters in some order because it was on the next day being the d of October and exactly eight weeks and three days after the ship struck that I was torne from my companions in misfortune never to see them more  The men came to us towards sun set and told us they had seen Trout who said he should be ready for the negociation the next morning and bid us sing for joy We therefore all determined to yield to the proposals of the Caffres provided they involved no actual violation of our honour in which case it is but little to say that we would rather have sacrificed our lives than have consented  And now a number of melancholy reflections sunk our spirits to the dust and as we laid down to rest we compared ourselves to the children of Israel in captivity  commanded to sing the Lord's song in a strange land Indeed no moment of my life will ever have a more indelible place in my remembrance than that night Overcome with fatigue sunk into melancholy and our minds softened into a fixed sadness that weighed upon our hearts every one heightened the despondency of the present moment by the recollection of some happier time when the smiles of fortune had not a single film to obstruct them  It was within three hours of morning and it being my turn to relate some sad passage of my life I had scarcely inveighed against the treachery of a false friend the easy credulity of a jealous mistaken husband and deplored the loss of a lovely infant when all of a sudden two Caffres rushed upon us tore me away from my companions and folding me up in a sort of wrapper darted with me across the sand Whether my cries  were so smothered as not to be heard or whether my companions took a false direction in any attempt to rescue me from these wretches I know not but it was a considerable time before they stopped and when they did I was delivered into the power of Trout who guess my distraction announced himself as the villainSourby  Oh heavens what did I feel at this moment No wonder I had shuddered every time I had seen the wretch though always at a distance no wonder his person and voice disguised as they were seemed familiar to me no wonder in short I should apprehend the worst of perdition when so malignant a fiend was hovering round me  His companions had scarcely set me down when after exchanging a few words with him in a language I did not understand  they disappeared like lightning I began to tear the air with my cries but he entreated me not to be alarmed said that the moments were precious and it would be my fault if he made an improper use of them  He said that the law having taken hold of him in England he had determined from that moment to repent and become a valuable member of any country on which he should happen to be thrown That the captain of the transport ship had so well liked his behaviour that he had put him on board a vessel bound to the Brazils with a recommendation to a merchant there  This merchant finding him very capable of conducting business had entrusted him with several commissions to the Cape of Good Hope where he was going on very prosperously and would have made a fortune but for an extraordinary accident  which he was sorry it fell to his lot to relate because it nearly concerned me 'Me' cried I "Yes you" said he "but be not alarmed your husband is no more and finding you in this inhospitable place I entreat that I may be your protector in his stead"  'My husband dead' said I "Yes" answered he "but I revenged him I put the Dutch villain to death with my own hand who had dared to lift his against my friend"  There seemed so much rhodomontade in this that I could not for my life give credit to it I disembled however and with a deep sigh the offspring of involuntary fear enquired into the particulars when I learnt that he had found John Hewit in a fray at the Cape where a Dutchman had stabbed him with a snickasnee that he himself as he informed me before had immediataly put the Dutchman  to death who being a man of some consideration he was obliged to fly that since that time he had lived amongst the Caffres who would not admit him till he had taken a wife from their tribe that he had detested the life he led that from the moment he saw me for he knew me immediately he had meditated my escape which it was now in his power to effect  He added that he had entirely amended his life that I knew very well that he never loved any woman but me that he did not consider his marriage among the Caffres as any way binding and that if I would escape with him to Madagascar where he had no doubt but we should get very safe he would there marry me and called Heaven to witness that if I would trust myself in his care no violence should be offered to me He then finished by appealing to me whether in gratitude I ought not to marry the man who had avenged the death of my husband  The morning now dawned and as the day in those countries comes on very fast I deserned by the sea shore a man waiting with a kind of shallop I considered in a moment that I should be safer in the company of two men even though they should be both villains than with one I knew it must be deep dissimulation that could impose upon Sourby yet I was determined to dissemble  I told him that liberty nay even life itself was at that time of very little moment to me and even if from moral or religious motives I could wish to preserve either what could I possibly hope from him who had made it his uniform pretence to deceive and impose upon me  He declared he liked me the better for detesting his former character but he was now no longer that character his intentions were honourable and in whatever he might be found deficient he  should consider it the pride of his life to be corrected by my better mind and superior judgment  This affected compliment to my sagacity by which he thought to impose upon me was not thrown away I put that sagacity in practice in a moment and penetrating his heart and intentions though I found him a greater villain than ever I determined guarded as I was to risk every thing for my liberty I therefore reluctantly appeared to consent assigning such motives as would be most likely to impose upon him and now as we walked towards the boat my wrapper still round me which proved to be a morning gown belonging to poor captain Coxson I enquired what men were those who carried me off and where they were gone  He told me that my question involved the fate of all my companions the nature  of which he would inform me They were all that morning to be surrounded and taken prisoners after which a proposal would be made for the men to take Caffre wives and the women Caffre husbands which if any refused to do they would be killed and eaten That he had with great difficulty kept this business in a state of suspension for the last three weeks which time he had employed in getting ready the shallop and stocking it with provisions that having despaired of getting me away by fair means he had employed force and that the two Caffres which people are always faithful when they were employed but vindictive if deceived had undertaken to effect this upon promise of being rewarded  The reward he had promised the Caffres was three buffaloes and five deer which at parting he had given them orders to drive to their own kraal  but they would find he said no such buffaloes nor deer for he had been obliged to part with them to another Caffre to procure a part of our supply therefore said he you see the necessity of using expedition for if these men should find out the deceit and return before we get away I shall become a sacrifice Nay this may serve to convince you of my sincerity for if cruelly you now refuse my forfeit life will soon expiate my former crimes  Though I saw the villain in every word of this I affected to believe him and appearing pleased at this instance of his seeming confidence I signified some anxiety about getting away In a very short time we got to the shallop which I found guarded by the very carpenter's mate whom we had given over as one devoured by wild beasts  As this young man had demeaned himself  with great propriety and decorum I took heart at the sight of him but what was my surprize when he caught an opportunity of whispering to me when Sourby was fetching some things at a distance "You are in the hands of a villain seem to trust him by all means If he behaves ill I know how to defend you"  Sourby had told me not to contradict him in any thing he should say as to the motives of our intended voyage He said he had amused this young man with the promise of mountains when we should reach Madagascar where he pretended I had a very rich brother In consequence of these and other promises he had from the wreck of the Grosvenor formed this shallop which was well built both for surfs and seas and plentifully stored so that there could be no doubt but we should escape in safety  Placing an implicit trust in providence I suffered myfelf to be conducted on board The weather was uncommonly serene and beautiful and sailing under favour of an awning that protected us from the scorching rays of the sun we went before the wind under a kind of square sail at so expeditious a rate that in about four hours we lost sight of the African coast  My mind was so fully made up to all consequences and I knew so well the nature of every risk I could possibly run that having plenty of provisions and very comfortable things to wrap myself in by way of temporary cloathing I felt as if inspired with new life I stipulated for a partition to be made for me abaft where I might retire as often and as long as I pleased especially when I might be inclined to sleep and that every attention should be strictly kept which delicacy and decorum demanded  These conditions were inviolably observed and for six days during which time we kept the sea the weather being still mild and favourable I cannot say I had any thing to complain of Sourby appeared to pay me great deference and respect constantly alluding to the acknowledgements he should receive from my brother when he should have safely delivered me into his hands and the carpenter's mate seemed very thankful for the promises that were made him in return for the assistance he was affording us As to the rest the fate of my afflicted friends on the coast of Africa was often the subject of our conversation and we comforted ourselves with the hope of sending assistance to them from Madagascar in which hope we were none of us sincere for we must have known no such thing was practicable  In proportion as conversation becomes familiar nothing is so easy as to catch people  tripping Cunning as he was this was often the case with Sourby but much oftener with the carpenter's mate who was more artless nay I will not say it did not sometimes happen to me Thus getting equally distrustful we grew grave reserved and cautious As for myself confiding in nothing but my firm and unalterable resolution I was prepared for any act however desperate to free me from impending danger and for the men a thousand half hints and significant gestures convinced me that they were bent on each other's destruction  On the seventh day this moodiness rather encreased than diminished While we were venturing every possible conjecture as to our situation and disputing about it pretty warmly all round we plainly saw land and the wind setting fair for the shore we made towards it pretty fast This discovery was for ten minutes a subject of general exultation Presently  we had all our different meditations on it At last it threw such a gloom over us as each bosom throbbed with its own conslict that it must have been pitable to have seen us  I have thought an hundred times what a dreadful degradation of humanity this scene presented That three beings who dared to tempt the dangerous ocean with so insignificant a protection who had found in providence a generous safeguard and an unering pilot instead of exulting at this unexampled salvation instead of vowing to devote themselves to the protection of each other should indulge in nothing but criminal and unfeeling selfishness  My conduct however Heaven knows had an innocent motive for I began to fear both my conductors and had no doubt when once ashore when one  should have killed the other in rival contention my honour was to be the prize of the victor  I had not long however to think upon this before we saw a monstrous shark making towards us at which moment whether it was his previous intention or whether his conduct arose from an instantaneous impulse on seeing the shark I knew not but Sourby seized a kind of pole ax and aimed it at the head of the carpenter's mate  I screamed and catched at his arm but not so effectually as wholly to prevent the blow which however fell obliquely on the poor man's stomach instead of his head when mark the finger of providence My intervention diverting the arm of Sourby from the direction he intended it should take and by that means throwing his body out of its equipoise unable to recover  his feet he staggered from the thwart on which he had stood and fell into the sea  My cries were now reiterated I entreated he might be saved whatever might be the consequence He implored in Christ's name we would assist him declaring himself to have been the worst of all villains but that he would amend his life The poor carpenter's mate though almost lifeless seconded my endeavours but in vain for before we could get him into the boat he uttered incoherently 'Binns Hewit' Then gave a frightful scream and was nipt in two by the monster  If ever unerring justice gave an awful example in the death of any man it did in the death of this He had been a shark to his fellow creatures Peace of mind domestic felicity character honour  loveliness innocence had all been a prey to his insatiate rapacity and now Oh matchless instance of impartial retaliation he himself became a prey to the merciless monster whose remorseless voracity had been his imitation  CHAP III IN WHICH HANNAH HEWIT AFTER FRESH DISTRESS OCCASIONED BY ANOTHER DISASTER FINDS HERSELF ALONE ON A DESOLATE ISLAND  PENETRATED with horror as I was at this shocking circumstance I nevertheless kept sight of our perilous situation and fearing lest the sanguinary monster should return to devour us I conjured M'Daniel to hasten with all expedition to the shore  Poor fellow he was unable to assist me He had received his death blow He attempted to rise but panted like a bird  and fell backwards seeing therefore I had nothing else for it I exerted all my resolution I spread the sprit across the sail put the head of the shallop right for the shore and the wind and tide setting in I dare say it was not more than half an hour when we were scarcely afloat upon an even sand as fair and as firm as the beach at the foot of Portland Island  I cheered my companion in the best manner I could leading him with great difficulty up a gradual eminence where he might sit down in shelter from the flowing tide and rest himself more at his ease than in the boat I then fetched him every refreshment I could find and fearing lest night should surprize me I moored the shallop in the best manner my strength would permit and returned to the assistance of M'Daniel who I yet hoped with care and attention would recover  I was deceived he grew fainter and  fainter and so far from being able to eat he could scarcely speak However in broken sentences he told me that Sourby had deluded him from the company under a promise that he should regain his liberty and make his fortune by means of a gentleman at Madagascar that he had believed his story and was willing enough to adventure in his scheme but upon being told that this gentleman's name was Higgins a doubt had arisen in his mind for that he knew captain Higgins had served under him and had a great value for him and also knew that he at that time which was the truth was settled comfortably in India for he had seen him when he put me on board the Grosvenor  This doubt had induced him to put other circumstances together and upon the whole he had no doubt but Sourby's intention was to steal me away with some sinister design Still it was his advice that I should attempt my escape as he should  be at hand to protect me if it became necessary and to this he added that he had himself conceived a violent passion for me from the first moment he saw me but understanding I was a married woman had checked it Believing now however that I was single it was his intention first to have deserved my affection and then to have offered his  All this in a very incoherent disjointed manner I got from M'Daniel who added that if out of his death should come my preservation he should heave his last sigh with pleasure  I omitted nothing that could cherish and comfort him I tenderly entreated him to take heart telling him that though he could never be my husband he should be my protector and my friend He scarcely now heard me life was forsaking him his respiration was thick broken and convulsed at length he fell into a violent fit  of coughing and the blood pouring in a torrent from his mouth he dropt lifeless at my seet  I apprehended that the blow had slightly irrupted a blood vessel about the heart that thus he had for a time bled inwardly until the parts being clogged with coagulated and extravasated blood the coughing was brought on by a violent effort of nature to discharge the inconvenience she laboured under that this had enlarged the orifice of the irrupted vessel and thus immediate death was the consequence  The humanity of the reader will form that picture of my calamitous situation that I am unable to describe Seated on the bank scarcely elevated enough to preserve me from the influx of the roaring waves that beat against an inaccessable rock of which my place of shelter formed the base my dead friend by my side the shades of night surrounding me uncertain  where fortune had thrown me I was so sunk with melancholy and petrified with horror that my harrassed faculties could scarcely teach me to think and sitting with my mind thus torpid and suspended reflection my torment and my relief my tears day that welcome harbinger of happiness to others seemed to smile benignly upon creation only to point out the most deplorable object in it  I had but two things to perish or to be resolute If gracious Providence had saved me from shipwreck afterwards from certain death or dishonour among the Caffres and at length from a perilous voyage in a small vessel upon a tremendous sea why should I accelerate my fate Ought not rather the magnitude of my danger to make me look it in the face To struggle all I could against it and at last if it should overwhelm me I should sink into peace with the conscious reflection that I had not shortened a life  trusted not to my disposal but the disposal of him who gave it  Searching now in my mind for resources I became more and more determined I first looked for the boat but alas my feeble strength had not secured it so as to bear the buffetting of the flowing and ebbing tide No trace of it remained and I dare say that for many hours it had floated out to sea  I instantly reflected that it was a mercy I had not been carried off by the tide in the same manner which must have been the case had not the moon been in the wane for by observing the objects about I could easily perceive that the spring tides flowed considerably higher than the top of the bank on which I stood it was therefore impossible I could maintain my position for more than a day or two at most I determined to take my  measures without delay and having vowed to him who gave me my being that I would not resign it till it should be his pleasure nor repine any farther than the weakness of human nature compelled me I began my pious task with consigning I would I could say to a peaceful grave the sad remains of my poor companion  With a shell which lay on the shore I contrived with much difficulty to dig a hole large enough to hold the body and having with great labour and trouble placed it there after a short but fervent prayer to the Deity I concealed the shocking spectacle from my eyes though Heaven knows it will never be shut out from my remembrance  My next care was to see for a safer place of shelter for which purpose I kept along the shore at the foot of the rock where having rambled I suppose about three miles I deserned an inlet whose  banks seemed to penetrate into the country and as the water at the time I discovered it ran from it towards the sea I had no doubt but that at its source it must be fresh  This discovery gave me a pleasure which I cannot express I had hardly properly speaking tasted good water since we left Trincomalee On board of ship every body knows it is very difficult to have good water that on the coast of Africa when we could get any at all which was very rare was at best brackish and since I left the Caffres the preserved juice of cooling fruits served us for its substitute  I was therefore very anxious to follow up this discovery but the attempt was attended with difficulty The banks if I may so call them of this rivulet were composed of ragged points of rock jetting  out sometimes so bold that they could not be attempted without manifest hazard  Seeing this I changed my course and took a circuitous route in a more practicable direction where the rivulet seemed to wind By this means after some fatigue I got upon an elevation from whence I could see great part of the country around me which I found partly rocky partly verdant and every where abounding with wildness and luxuriancy  Roaming about in this uncertain state if I had hitherto been prevented from tracing the river to its bed I was made ample amends by another object which I may fairly call manna in the wilderness It was the plantain tree which spread its nutrimental golden clusters within my reach so that in this short interval I had a prospect of water and a certainty of bread  Oh Heaven what were my sensations now The gratitude that warmed my soul infused into my heart a glow of delight that inspired me with the felicity of angels  I now pursued the track of the river with more ardour than ever and penetrating through a thick cluster of cedars round which it seemed to wind still taking care to mark my way I came to a sloping lawn down which it gently rolled its source apparently being the top of a very high mountain skirted with palms cedars cocoa trees and other lofty productions of the East  These researches having so beguiled the time that I plainly saw it would be in vain before the tide set in to attempt a retreat I concluded to ramble about and sleep for that night at the foot of a tree in the mean time having eaten some fruit of the plantain and drank some most delicious water I strolled to that part of the  rock next the sea when coming unexpectedly to the prominence which immediately overlooked the bank on which I had so dismally passed the night before good Heaven what did I behold  A huge sea lion had raked the body of the carpenter's mate out of the sand and was at that moment feasting upon it I gazed with horror and surprize and again felt that sweet sensation of gratitude that has so often repaid me by one moment's exquisite pleasure for days and months of pain Could I distrust that a particular providence watched over me Else why did I leave the place where I was sure to meet inevitable destruction Why was I invited to the wholesome plantain and the refreshing spring Was this chance No it was the especial care of that power who I knew would never forsake me so long as I put my trust in him  Full of these thankful sensations I  hastened to the river and filled with my chrystal beverage a small keg which I had the precaution to sling at my back I then reascended the rock and having found a beautiful retreat interwoven with moss and thick tendrils I made another salutary meal and when night approached confidently resigned myself into the arms of sleep  CHAP IV HANNAH'S INGENUITY PUT TO THE TEST 'TILL HAVING EXERCISED IT PRETTY VARIOUSLY SHE FINDS HERSELF TOLLERABLY WELL OFF  I SLEPT in great tranquility for several hours and having awoke a considerable time before day light I began to ruminate on my situation and to consider of every expedient necessary for me to adopt in order to make it as comfortable as possible  With the boat I had certainly lost many resources and the few things I had been able to get ashore as they consisted  only of some provisions we had brought away from the coast of Africa such as a few jars of potted deer and preserved fruits they could now be of no material use to me The jars indeed would have been welcome but then I thought perhaps I might find shells or some other substitute to answer the purpose as well  I determined at all adventures not to return to the sand bank and if I should find it necessary upon any occasion to seek the sea shore to do so as carefully as possible The circumstance of the sea lion was a very serious caution and it behoved me to shun every opportunity of exposing myself to danger from which if it once surrounded me it would be impossible for me to extricate myself  After turning my situation in every  possible point of view and making up my mind as to my safety which I was determined never to doubt till the consumation of my fate should fill up the measure of destiny the smiling morn found me as chearful as itself what had I to wish for but shelter food and rayment and these the birds that warbled round my head found easily and were thankful for the blessing  Why then should I repine A thousand houses built of the most beautiful materials and erected by the most perfect architect courted my acceptance A single rock could furnish for me a magnificent dwelling with all its compartments For food I could not have luxuries but I could imbibe health at every mouthful and for cloathing the inhabitants of that part of the world needed none and even if it were necessary to an ingenious mind something might be easily contrived  out of leaves feathers and a variety of other materials that I could already perceive I should find in much greater abundance than would be necessary to answer my purpose  In this cheerful disposition did I walk abroad and while the birds hymned their gratitude to that power that gave them another day my heart in silent servency joined the general thanksgiving  My first idea was to set my face to all that I could stand the smallest possible chance of encountering for that purpose I set about ascending the mountain whence the river seemed to derive its source guessing which I own was my greatest apprehension that I should thereby discover whether any part of the place was inhabited  With great difficulty in about six  hours I accomplished my purpose when I plainly saw I was upon an island according to my judgment of about five miles and a half by about nine miles the whole view of which like the Peak of Teneriffe this emminence commanded I did not disern the smallest trace of buildings or any thing that could lead me to believe that human creatures had ever been accustomed to reside there  I saw some wild deer and an animal of the buffalo kind and several species of monkies but they all ran away from me and took shelter in the woods I had lost so much time that I was under the necessity of sleeping by the side of an immense bason which proved to be the source of the river and which plainly like the original reservoir at Antigua was supplied by the clouds to fertilize the island  I passed however a very uncomfortable  night the bellowing braying and chattering of beasts and the hissing of snakes filled my mind with a good deal of apprehension and though I did not at all repent that I had made this experiment I determined in future to keep in the more rocky part of the place as I was convinced I should there be subject to less annoyance  Mistaking my way I descended by another branch of the river which led me gradually to a ridge of rocks that extended far into the sea and at low water appeared small and ragged for a considerable distance not very unlike the Giants' Causeway in Ireland I was at first disappointed at this circumstance but as I went on I found I had no reason to be under much concern for the plantain grew every where round in great perfection and what gave me infinite pleasure I found orange lime citron shaddock and olive trees  and in the brakes there grew in large quantities a species of wild cotton  In addition to this welcome discovery I found that the river spread through a verdant plain at the foot of a large rock and continued upon a level surface for many hundred yards after which it suddenly disappeared among the brakes and through fissures and gave notice only by its murmuring that it bent its course to the ocean  Near the plain through which as I before observed glided the river a large cavern ran into the rock to a prodigious extent extremely in appearance like that part of the Derbyshire rocks near Castleton which is called one of the wonders of the Peak Here being supplied with oranges citrons and several other fruits besides that of the plantain tree having a large canal before my door and being  besides wonderfully sheltered from weather and other inconvenience I thought I could not do better than set up my rest especially as it was now high time to square the sort of life I should lead by something like method and regularity  In the first place I had by way of cloaths only the wrapper I spoke of with a piece of old muslin tied round my head and a pair of sandals on my feet made of a buffalo's hide and tied with thongs of leather All these were inconveniencies which I had already considered how to remedy  Again I wanted a comfortable place for repose for though I had experienced good weather thitherto I had no idea how long it might last This place I thought I could easily manage to procure myself within the hollow of the rock Indeed I had formed a hundred projects which I  had no doubt but I should set about with great facility and which as well as being an agreeable bodily refreshment would serve to amuse my mind and divert it from that distraction that now and then in spight of all my fortitude it was involved in  The first step I took to effect my purpose was to explore the different recesses of my cavern which were divided and subdivided into apartments rude indeed but some of them wonderfully compact and convenient But what pleased me most was that in all my researches I found nothing that could induce me to believe the place was infested by any savage or noxious animals  As mortals however in proportion as they emancipate from their natural state find many artificial wants so I felt out the necessity of considerable alterations in  my residence before I could make it tenable Some apartments sweat with humidity others were choaked up with brambles and then such an universal gloom pervaded the whole place that a light would be an article not to be dispensed with  These difficulties very frequently put me to a stand but as difficulty stimulates invention and active minds succeed best when they struggle with opposition so in a very short time I had surmounted almost every impediment likely to obstruct my operations  In the first place having observed a fissure which gave a glimmering of light into the interior part of the cavern I found it out on the outside and having widened it by removing the earth and stones about it which happened to be little more than rubbish where grew some low  shrubbery I at different times obtained a perforation equal to three feet square  This threw day into a great part of the the cavern in the nature of a skylight but the reader must not suppose I was not aware that rain might enter it also an inconvenience that it was my care to remedy which I did in this manner  I gathered some twigs from a tree that were as supple as oziers and wattling them together in the nature of an openwork basket I formed them into a frame large enough for my purpose Having done this I got together a quantity of plantain leaves and wetting those with a gum that oozed from a tree which seemed to be a species of the larch I hardened them in the sun and they grew tough and pelucid These I placed on my frame and having slightly wattled another coat of oziers to secure them I fixed them into their situation  placing earth of an adhesive quality like clay neatly at all the extremities in the nature of putty and thus made a complete window by way of skylight  My next care was to contrive something like a couch to sleep upon This I managed by forming a basket in the nature of a cot which I lined with matting made of the rushes that grew in great abundance and variety by the side of my canal Having done this I gathered a large quantity of cotton picked it and beat it with two sticks and then spread it out in slakes or as the wool combers call it slivers this done I placed within my cot a layer of cotton and a layer of mats until the whole formed a succession of mattrasses perfectly elastic and thus by a little ingenuity I contrived a most comfortable bed  Cloaths began now to be a material consideration I had found the poor captain's  morning gown so cumbersome and inconvenient that I had reserved only the sleeves and the back of it in their old shape and had torne all the rest into aprons but still so many parts of my body and limbs were exposed that the parching rays of the sun became at last intolerable  A variety of expedients suggested themselves to remedy this inconvenience but they were either impracticable for want of implements or infefficient from the nature of the materials I had plantain leaves and the leaves of the catalpa but could I have sewed them together their texture would not have borne it so as to last any time  The first attempt that was attended with any thing like success was twisting cotton into a kind of ropes and so winding it round every part in the same manner as the Hottentots twist round them the intestines of  animals so that had the cotton been of many colours I should have looked like a fury dressed out in snakes but this fashion which I found very uncomfortable soon gave way to another  I dressed some fine cotton into as thin flakes as possible by means of the prickly pear leaf which is formed exactly like an instrument for carding This done I spun with a kind of common distaff a large quantity of cotton thread some fine some coarse then with a thorn that I used for a needle I sewed the edges of these slivers together till I had got a large piece but this was making very little progress for the least tension would have pulled all my work to pieces  What I had done however was a great point gained My next scheme was to form a net with large open mashes of an extent sufficient to cover my cotton  which having done on one side I found it necessary to do the same on the other thus the cotton lay between the two nets exactly like wadding in a cloak and the net being fastened at proper distances by the knots it kept pretty well together  To effect all this took me a great deal of time and was an inconceivable trouble to me and at last I could do nothing with my netting to answer any good purpose till I had washed it dipped it in gum water and stretched it in the sun to dry  Having pretty well carried this point I braided cotton thread into laces of given lengths and at last formed a sort of dress cut in the fashion and laced on in the manner of a harlequin's jacket and trowsers  But after all this curious dress so ingeniously contrived like the first gave way  to another which though it did not suggest itself till after I had taken so much trouble was perfectly obvious and answered every desired end being nothing more than a jacket and trowsers knit with cotton in the nature of knitting a stocking  For my head I formed a sort of helmit out of rushes which I lined with fine cotton and for my feet I made sandals of very small oziers which I lined with cotton and fastened with laces  And now having a habitation a bed to lie on cloaths to cover me two cane charis a ozier table covered with a mat and several other conveniencies I shall enumerate the time and trouble all this process took me which will be found very little when it is considered how few resources I had but what immediately resulted from the fertility of my invention and how little I was assisted by a knowledge of what expedients others had  adopted in similar exigencies for whether it was from a dread of mind or any other cause I will not pretend to say but I had never in my life read Robinson Crusoe Alexander Selkirk Peter Quarles nor any of those books which of course would have afforded me in my situation many serviceable hints  This last circumstance I mention among other reasons to defend my fame as a writer and I beg if it should appear that any of my expedients or contrivances bear a similitude to those of the persons above mentioned the matter may be candidly weighed and allowance made for the necessity of adopting similar measures in similar situations  CHAP V IN WHICH HANNAH CONTRIVES TO BEGIN HER HISTORY SHE IS VISITED BY INNUMERABLE GUESTS OF TWO SORTS SHE PROVIDES AGAINST THE RAINY SEASON WHICH COMING ON SHE EXPERIENCES VERY DISAGREEABLE EFFECTS FROM IT  I HAVE said that I left Cafraland on Wednesday the d day of October so that being six days and part of the seventh day at sea I landed on the desolate island where I have ever since resided on Wednesday the th and it was not until Saturday the th of November that I found myself in the comfortable situation I have just described nay when it is  considered how much I must have had to impede my exertions the wonder will be how I was able to accomplish it in so short a time  In the first place as it was my intention to retire to the sand bank on the evening of the day I left it I brought nothing with me that could be of any use but a keg and a knife The knife I unfortunately lost by the way and this misfortune I very much lamented for it was indispensibly necessary to have some sharp instrument in such work as cutting and shaping sticks stakes ozier twigs and rushes  Luckily my keg was strongly hooped with iron and I had no doubt but I should be able to accomplish by means of the hoops after some difficulty every thing I wanted A fire was now indispensibly necessary and my business was either by friction or some other means to procure one  I rubbed two sticks together which certainly after some trouble emitted something phosphoric but which the wood being green I could not fairly bring to a burning state I then struck several hard stones against the hoops of my keg holding some cotton underneath but neither were the sparks strong enough nor the cotton inflamable enough to produce fire  At length after a variety of ineffectual experiments perceiving that some sand which formed a few days before only an incrustation had now by the heat of the sun become vitrified I had great hopes I might effect my purpose through this medium in the nature of a burning glass for its form was very nearly concave and I was not to learn that any thing concave that has the power of reflection acts according to the laws of reflection and inclines  the rays of light to a point in their axis the burning depending upon the union of rays and the union of rays on the concave sperical figure Thus I have known gilded wooden mirrors as they are falsely called alabaster covered with gold or foil nay even mirrors made of paper covered with straw to emit rays of heat so as to burn inflamable objects with which they have come in contact  I don't know how far an experiment would have answered my purpose for I did not try one an accident of a singular nature having prevented me Looking round where I had swept together a vast quantity of leaves which I had from time to time stript off the oziers for I had made an excellent broom on which heap was thrown heavy rubbish in order to keep my working place clean a method I never neglected a smoke issued from the place I was instantly astonished at myself that I  had not thought of a thing so self evident this being a common expedient to procure fire but it is in our natures to search at random for what reflection would have shewn us in a beaten track  I encouraged the heat by beating and pressing it down with more stones till at length the smoke encreasing it burst into a flame exactly upon the principle of an overheated hay rick so that at present I left my scheme of trying an experiment on my vetrified incrustation which I determined however not to abandon for finding the composition extremely in the nature of the Chinese petunse I had no doubt but I should one day be able to make glass if not porcelaine the whole progress of which I had completely made myself mistress of during my stay in the vicinage of Derby  But the necessaries of life being my  first object it was proper that all idea of the luxuries should at present give way I therefore encouraged my fire and went so well to work that it turned out of great use to me I pitched upon a stone of the temper of porphyry for my anvil and having taken off the hoops from my keg I straitened them and now I was in possession of seven pieces of iron about twentyseven inches long three quarters of on inch wide and the sixteenth of an inch thick  I took one of the hoops and heating it in the fire I doubled it in two then again and again till having worked them each time with a polished stone into perfect cohesion I had a solid piece of iron more than half an inch thick and about three inches long  I took another hoop which I worked with the same kind of labour into a punch  and having hardened it I beat my other piece of iron at one end to the shape of a bricklayer's lathing hammer I then punched a hole through the middle large enough to contain a handle then hardened it and thus I had a complete hammer to drive at one end and cut at the other  I could now work more handily and indeed I did so to so good a purpose that before I had used all my hoops I was in possession of the hammer before mentioned two very good knives a pair of scissars three punches of different sizes and brads and nails to the tune of between three and four hundred I attempted to make a saw but finding it would be no use without a file which was beyond my ability I thought I had better as I said before convert the materials into nails and brads which I might again transform if I should find it necessary  Being thus furnished with implements  it will not appear extraordinary that I should accomplish all I have already related especially when it is recollected that I had been perfectly instructed in these matters at Wolverhampton where I once made a pair of scissars for a wager though I had never attempted such a thing before  In my intervals of leisure during the prosecution of this work it was my custom to exame every thing around me as well to see whether I could discover any materials to assist my labours as to search for shell fish In this latter pursuit I was particularly fortunate for I found towards the shore plenty of sea snails limpets and that delicious dainty known by the name of the hammer oyster  In a lake also or bason formed in a hollow rock and which communicated both with the sea and my river according to circumstances I discovered several sorts of fish which I apprehended came into the  fresh water to spawn exactly as salmon and other fish are known to do in England Among these there was a kind of congereel or rather a sea snake This gave me particular pleasure not only on account of the skin which I knew would serve me for a variety of uses but for the oil it would yield me  In this lake also I found part of a shark's skeleton which creature had no doubt ventured during a spring tide to follow the fish that took shelter there and had got into such shoal water that he was unable to get back again and was thus starved to death The bones of this fish which was of the lamia species I put to various uses but the teeth were particularly serviceable to me every one of them serving for an excelent saw a tool of all others I stood most in need of  Being now provided with every thing  that could possibly be of use to me even to a comb which I formed out of the she'll of a land crab I thought there would be no crime if I went on even to luxuries as it would give a new spur to my genius and employ my mind ever active in those pursuits best calculated to expand it and thus diversify my employments so as to leave no time for the intruder care  And first I panted to gratify what I had always a longing for which was no less than by some means to set down the eventful particulars of my strange history I had seen at Surat a Malabar manuscript which seemed to be wrought not written on palm leaves by the intervention of some medium which bit in the letters exactly upon the same principle as acquafortis is used for etching upon copper This art certainly came from the antients who when they had occasion to set down any thing they composed used tablets  coated with wax on which they wrote with a needle pointed at one end for the purpose of marking the words and flatted at the other for the purpose of effacing the errors In this they must have used some composition for in order to promulgate their opinions fair copies were taken upon a sort of paper called charta made from the plant papyrus which grows in Egypt or else upon a sort of parchment or vellum made from the skins of animals which was called membranas indeed the origin of writing must have been leaves the divisions of a book being to this day called by that name  In imitating of these methods I dried plantain leaves took the soundest of them and having spread a thin gum over them I used a corrosive substance something of the nature of what issues from the mangeneal tree which marked upon the  leaf pretty well but I was very awkward at first especially as I had to mark every thing with a point and afterwards fill up the interstices with the composition Habit however rendered the task pretty practicable and having at last managed to make an iron pen I lowered my ingredient to the consistency of ink and afterwards wrote with tolerable facility  Before I began my grand work I cleared my way and having wiped off those different calculations of what had happened to me at particular times since I had been deprived of the usual methods of communication and which calculations I had made by means of pins knots in a string stakes driven into the ground shells placed at particular distances or any other method that struck me at the time as proper to answer the purpose I was prepared by the st of January to begin my history  The main chance however was the object most necessary for my attention and though I was determined to give as much time as I could properly spare to recording my life even though my labours should never see the light yet prudence whispered to me that there were many important duties also to be performed if I expected to be comfortable  In the first place the weather had been wonderfully favourable for me thitherto but I knew so well the nature of that climate that I must not expect it to continue so for any length of time my business therefore was to guard against every emergency and in particular I considered that it would be necessary to furnish myself with such a stock as should answer every purpose in case I should be obliged during the rainy season to keep house  As however this urgency did not  seem so very pressing as at present to demand a sacrifice of every thing else I apportioned my time so as to have alternately some labour and some amusement This was my general mode of passing the twenty four hours  I arose soon after the sun and having offered up a most sincere thanksgiving to him who had permitted me to survive so many trials I walked out and according as I was guided by the tide either sought for shell fish angled in my river or searched for such food as should be necessary for my present and future purposes  Having stocked myself to my mind I retired home to breakfast which meal by this time I had made very comfortable In an infusion from the sagoe tree I found a pleasanter and more nutritive beverage than tea and the plantain fruit kneaded  and baked produced me an eatable at least equal to Yorkshire cakes  After breakfast I went about all the manual labour necessary for that day till twelve o'clock when I set about my cookery which generally consisted of limpets stewed with rice or Indian wheat with both of which I was now stocked or else the hammer oyster roasted or some other fish of which particularly one very delicious and extremely like the baracoota my lake abounded  Immediately after dinner I went to writing This was my employment till four o'clock then I indulged myself with a most delightful walk in which I often made new discoveries This was the most pleasing yet the most melancholy part of the day for though every object furnished me with a new motive for contemplation and though every day's experience gave  my heart a fresh reason to throb with gratitude for the tranquility I enjoyed yet the declining sun never failed to cast a gloom over me which nothing perhaps but the imbecility of human nature can either account for or excuse  Before the day set in I illuminated my apartments for by this time I had made several lamps with layers of dried catalpa leaves cemented with gum in the same manner as fire workers make their small mortars for  pots de brins pots des aigrettes  c The oil I had boiled from the sea snake I purified till it became superior to the best spermacaeta oil I ever saw and my wicks of course were made of cotton I had it in contemplation to make candles but the lamps answered my purpose at least for the present full as well  My supper was generally boiled rice or else a sort of millet which I sweetened  with an extract from the locust tree and having taken this and closed the day with the same gratitude to the Creator that I commenced it I retired to my couch sometimes cheerful sometimes with a sigh and now and then perhaps with a tear and then resigned myself to repose  Thus I went on with very little variation except improving all my old schemes and contemplating new ones and among the rest painting and music both of which I had concerted how to bring about till early in the month of March  One morning I shall never forget it As I took my walk a small cloud as it appeared to me all of a sudden dimned the sun It grew larger and larger and more and more grew the gloom Dismayed at I knew not what I stood in a state of stupefaction my terror encreased till by  and by the monstrous mass made towards the island which it seemed large enough to cover When I had recovered a little my suspended faculties I discerned the truth it was a cloud of birds nor was it long before I was convinced of it by their chattering and screaming At length with the most hideous yells they pitched every where about me and I soon divined these creatures like the birds that at certain seasons of the year build their nests in many islands particularly the Isle of Wight had for that purpose paid my place a visit and thus I should be troubled with them perhaps a few weeks after which they would disappear with their young It now struck me that if I had adroitness enough I should not only furnish myself with eggs but feast upon the young ones  I found nothing except their hideous noise that was disagreeable to me In a  day or two they began without any ceremony to build their nests and I soon saw that with little difficulty I should supply myself with as many eggs as I pleased but it was not a week before another phenomenon appeared which gave me much more uneasiness than the birds This was no less than a whole swarm of monkies who seemed to have as great a relish for birds eggs as myself  Many of these I had seen in the wood on the top of the mountain as I before mentioned where they took no notice of me I was soon convinced however this would not be the case here It is true that at first they avoided me but as my form became more familiar to them they came nearer and nearer and demonstrated by their chattering that they had no objection to be more familiar with me This gave me great uneasiness especially  as I perceived several among them of the large baboon kind  I had luckily before the monkies made their appearance furnished myself with a large stock of eggs I therefore thought I had better stay at home and give up the idea of searching for young birds for that probably if I concealed myself for a time when the birds went away the monkies might disappear also  This answered my purpose very well for nine or ten days but one morning while at my work I was surprized by a monstrous large baboon The hideous wretch caught hold of me in a moment and it was with great difficulty I shook him off I instantly menanced him in the most determined manner and he seemed so terrified at my voice that he slunk away He returned however and cringed and fawned and played so many monkey's  tricks that the striking resemblance of his grimaces to the pert addresses of a coxcomb would have provoked me to laughter had it not been that I saw plainly he grew bolder and bolder At last as he most impudently advanced towards me with one blow of my hammer which I happened to have in my hand I laid him dead at my feet  I next dragged the horrid creature out of the cavern and threw it down the rock where it stuck on a craggy point as if in terorem to the rest and this effect I really began to think it had taken for I presently saw the monkies in a croud chattering very busy about it and in a very few days they all disappeared  I had nothing now but the birds to encounter and not having eaten animal food so long except fish I took a nest of young ones and found them an exceedingly fine  dish They had very much the slavour of wheatears but were as large as pigeons What a store to have some of these potted I set to work immediately prepared a number of shells and through the medium of the wild alspice and other pungent aromatics made so excellent a seasoning that I am sure could it have been sent from any distance in London as a rariety my dish would have been considered as a delicious luxury at the first tables  I had now taken every precaution in case the rainy season should set in and in one instance it was well I did I had very soon found that my visitors the birds fed wholly on the plantain fruit and before they decamped if I did not take care would fairly strip all the trees in my neighbourhood I therefore made a quantity of it into biscuit and baked it hard for the purpose of serving me like a sea store  And now came a most dreary time indeed The birds on the information of a few clouds assembled one morning and on the very next went gradually off in the same order I had seen them approach They took their course northward lessening until to my view they became a point and then nothing  In two days more it began to rain and in a few hours the clouds seemed to embrace the island threatened to overwhelm it My river swelled torrents of water poured down the rock and an ordinary mind would have been terrified at the apprehension of a compleat inundation My only fear was that when the immense bason on the top of the mountain should overflow the natural receptacles for carrying off the water would become ineffectual and my situation being not only subterraneous but in some degree subaqueous some torrent might force its way through the different  hollows of the rock so as to fill my habitation in which case I must have inevitably perished  Perceiving nothing of this kind however and finding the rain though continual by no means violent I made the best of my lot and amused myself as well as I could I had got on pretty forward in my history which was now almost my only employment and really when upon perusing the different passages of my life it called to my recollection that in a peopled world I had found as little assistance except from my own exertions as in a desolate island I could not help through the medium of pity for the follies of my fellow creatures taking to myself some satisfaction for the rectitude of my intentions compared with the duplicity of theirs  In this manner did I go on amusing  myself and beguiling the dreary time until one morningit was my birthdayOh Heaven what a birthday I had in a long and sincere prayer thanked that Being for all his mercies who had graciously permitted me to see thirty nine years pass over my head I had breakfasted felt myself uncommonly light and alert when just as I had laughed heartily at the whimsical manner that Walmesley always made light of his misfortunes I was seized with a vertigo and fell lifeless on the ground  When I came to myself a cold shivering succeeded my knees knocked together and my teeth chattered in my head I heaped fuel on my fire and beginning to glow from its effects I fell into a most violent fever but finding myself extremely dizzy and feeling every symptom of an approaching delirium I instantly took an emetic which I had prepared from the  ipecacuanha root and to that I have no doubt I owe my life for what the practice in England may be now I know not but though it was at one time very much scouted I was one of the first that induced the physicians in Warwickshire to give emetics in an early stage of a fever  Could I have been comfortably lodged I have no doubt but I should have been well in a day or two but owing to the humidity every where around which in proportion as the rain continued sweat through every pore of the rock and to catching one cold upon another I grew so weak and so emaciated that I began seriously to think my unfortunate days would very shortly be numbered  To add to my wretched state I was so nervous that the least noise threw me into the horrors I fancied a thousand dreadful  things I have found myself conjuring the firm rock not to fall upon my head the sea not to swell up and drown me I have held conversations with death who condescendingly deigned to visit me that I might be familiarized to his presence I had determined for fear of surprize to make my coffin and one morning I actually caught myself digging my own grave  I had sustained this dreadful complication of complaints about six weeks for ill as I was I never failed to know how the time passed when to add to my shocking distress it began to blow such a hurricane as if all nature was threatened with annihilation Pieces of the rocks were torne from their base and hurled into the sea trees were blown about like feathers yet it had one good effect it certainly relieved my nerves  and though I was bowed down to the earth yet the emergency being great my mind met it with its usual fortitude I was alarmed but I thanked God that I was at last firm  CHAP VI HANNAH IS DREADFULLY ALARMED WHENCE THE ALARM PROCEEDED HER APPREHENSIONS INCREASE SHE IS WITNESS TO DISTRESS WHICH SHE CANNOT RELIEVE AND ESCAPES DEATH HERSELF IN A WONDERFUL MANNER  REDUCED both in body and mind to the deplorable condition I have just described I one night reclined upon my couch expecting and indeed wishing for a speedy termination of all my cares The elementary contention that for two days had raged with so much violence seemed to increase and the horizon on which I had been accustomed to see the sun descend  with majesty and a serenity that gave piety to contemplation was now tinged with a thick dusky red which reflected on the waves and broken into a thousand shades by their agitation gave the prospect an effect so horribly tremendous that it seemed as if devoted nature was instantly to be engulphed in a sea of blood  Dreadful as this idea was the enfeebled condition of my distracted frame still heightened it I stretched out my hand and having taken a little of a beverage I had that day made which my stomach seemed to receive with unusual pleasure I soon found myself inclined to sleep  It was now quite dark and I had scarcely recommended myself to that providence which had hitherto so graciously watched over and protected me and implored the same protection for my husband when I insensibly sunk into the  arms of sleep but what words shall describe my next sensation  I had slept about eight hours and was lost in one of those delicious dreams which though they cannot be described must be remembered by every one who in sickness has experienced the moment at which delirium resigns the mind to renovation when the firm rock trembled under me the caverns groaned with a terrific noise and the whole island seemed as if sinking into nothing The noise grew fainter and fainter and at length I could hear nothing more than the agitated waves and the whistling winds  I had lain a few minutes in stupid astonishment scarcely acknowledging life or knowing how to use it when another tremendous concussion like the former shook the island The moment recollection had succeeded to wonder I concluded  it was an earthquake and expected every moment to be swallowed up I therefore fell on my knees and having put up a short but sincere prayer to the Deity waited my fate in that posture with calm and determined resignation  The fervour which my ejaculations had called forth in my mind gave me uncommon collection and the noise being again repeated I easily noticed that its continuation and gradually dying away proceeded from a succession of echoes I therefore supposed that the violence of the storm had torne away the prominent fragments of a rock which falling into a hollow had caused the noise and all its consequences This of course dispelled every apprehension of personal danger for which I uttered a pathetic thanksgiving and rose  Finding myself wonderfully refreshed  by sleep I made my way towards the door to see if I could discover whether the storm had abated Instantly a flash beamed across the cavern which was followed by the noise in the same manner as before I should have conceived that my alarm had proceeded from thunder had I not particularly remarked that the noise had nothing disjointed or continual in it It was one single burst like an explosion which was multiplied only by the echoes from the surrounding rocks  A gleam of hope at this instant darted across my mind It could not proceed from what I first conjectured because of the flash It could not be thunderWhat then could it be but the explosion of a cannon And from what could the explosion of a cannon proceed but from some ship in distress in the Offing I resolved therefore to sally forth and fire a  beacon which I one day had raised when my mind seemed to anticipate this very accident  Despair lends strength to the weak and resolution to the timid I accomplished my purpose and now what a variety of sensations agitated my mind Who knew how many lives I might have been born to preserve Who knew but my own wanderer the author of all my wretchedness might be sent at last to alleviate my deplorable condition Four times did I hear the signal and four times did I add fuel to my pile At length the day appeared and all my hopes vanished into nothing  I must here mention a circumstance that I reflected on a long time with great horror While I was attending the fire a most hideous and frightful creature passed by me and made its way towards  the inaccessable part of the rock the summit of which as I before noticed was covered with a thick wood It appeared to me of the lion or tyger kind and I concluded that its intention was to make me its prey but alarmed by the fire it had ran from that it meant to have pursued  As the discovery of one of these creatures denoted the existence of more I had no doubt but the island was overrun with wild beasts a reflection of so shocking a nature that it for a time absorbed every other consideration nay even that of my probable preservation by means of the ship but alas Hope now seemed determined to desert me in every thing  Day having dawned it presented a dismal spectable to my sight I diserned about three miles from the foot of the rock a ship firmly aground The waves  yet ran mountains high and if it had not been for my entrenched situation I could not have kept my footing to make my remarks Looking further I saw two boats full of people striving to stem the fury of the surge and in seeing them I knew I saw so many people devoted to destruction The surf curling round the imperceptable jagged points of the rock were so many vortexes from which it was impossible for them to escape In short my fears were prophecies The boats all sunk and every soul perished  Almost the whole day had I been in this anxious distressing state with nothing to offer towards the succour of these poor shipwrecked wretches but my prayers when the storm came on to rage with a degree of violence more dreadful than ever accompanied with torrents of rain sheets of vivid lightning and peals of terrifying thunder Indeed soon did I witness the difference between the ineffectual  thunder invented by man and that which speaks the Deity for if the poor ship's signal of distress alarmed me in the morning so transcendantly awful was what I now heard that nothing but an implicit trust in him in whom we live and move and have our being weak and ill as I was could have preserved my reason or perhaps my life  Indeed I could not venture within the cavern drenched as I was in rain and weak for want of food till the thunder had gone by for there I knew the effect must be much stronger The thunder ceased but the storm continued with equal if not encreased violence and the tide setting in the sprays beat in such volumes against the rock that they seemed to threaten its very summit  Night now threw its suneral paul over these devoted wretches and I crept back  with difficulty to my shelter when lighting my lamp and throwing myself upon my couch I began to reflect on the various vicissitudes of that unfortunate day After such a series of misery chequered with expectation after so much promise and so much disappointment I lamented my fate in terms of the deepest despondency I wept aloud and bewailing myself in expressions of bitterest agony I had well nigh arrainged that providence on which I had so often and so effectually relied  This interval in which the weakness of human nature got the better for a moment of that strength of mind which had hitherto borne me out through all my trials though poignant was short I soon resumed my wonted fortitude and the recollection that self preservation was a duty I owed that Being who gave me a life to preserve induced me to sustain nature in  the best manner I could and after a humiliation in which my tears wonderfully relieved me I determined to seek for means to preserve life whatever misery that life might occasion me  I kindled a fire and heated some rice but finding this food not sufficiently nutritious to appease the gnawings of hunger I roasted three or four limpits which I devoured rather than ate after which I drank rather profusely of my new beverage and retired to my couch  I was instantly seized with a delirium my head swelled respiration was obstructed and I expected every moment would be my last A violent vomiting however succeeded and exertion of mind and body being at length exhausted I fell into a sort of sleep or rather trance out of which after viewing as in a dream all the circumstances of my life I awoke  in a very emaciated condition about ten o'clock the next morning  My mind was at that moment in such a state that it feared to repine Like a threatened child it dreaded the rod and deprecated that chastisement which it was not conscious it deserved I felt myself the offspring of humiliation and determined as far as human perseverance would allow me to suffer and smile Nor ever had I such cause to admire by what unseen ways the unerring hand of Providence permits evil for our good  I was about to drink of that beverage from which I had felt such salutary effects when like a filmy phantom beautiful at first to the sight and afterwards changed to filth and deformity I nauseated its view its smell and its taste I instantly of course forbore to touch it The truth beamed across my mind in a moment I  had swallowed poison The first dose being a small quantity operated on my distempered frame in the cordial and restorative manner I there described but the second being more potent had it not been for the opposition from the quantity of the food I had eaten and particularly the limpits which are very muscular and hard of digestion it would have deprived me of existence  Having found as I imagined the melongena or egg plant which every body knows and which particularly abroad is esteemed as a stimulus especially for the purpose of throwing warmth through the circulation and to the extremities when owing to any obstruction the vital heat is confined round the region of the heart I made it into what I thought a restorative cordial which I have frequently tasted but it is plain I had mistaken this plant for that species of the mandragore called the  mad apple which is a solanum and a deadly poison  Reflecting on this circumstance in every view I was profuse in my acknowledgments to Providence that had preserved me Had I not been hurried from the cavern by the signal of distress I should have had recourse to that beverage whose salutary effects I had experienced the night before and that way been poisoned Had I found opportunity during the course of the day I should have attended the same experiment and so have been poisoned Had I not strongly felt the calls of hunger when I came back and eat inordinately I should in that case have been poisoned The humility the sanctity the confidence the fortitude and above all the gratitude and the serenity that these considerations raised in my mind I shall ever feel but shall never be able to describe  I was determined after this never to call any thing an affliction and as the storm continued with undiminished rage I resolved to stay at home and endeavour to restore my strength before I made any further observations  CHAP VII A PROSPECT OF RELIEF BROUGHT ABOUT BY A MOST EXTRAORDINAY ACCIDENT AND AN INSTANCE OF HANNAH'S PIETY WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE FOUND ITS REWARD  I STEWED some limpits and made a beverage from raisons which I cooled by the addition of small pieces of a chalky substance that were scattered about among the viens in the rock and strongly impregnated with nitrous particles The limpet broth which I took sparingly proved a powerful restorative and the beverage which by the infusion of a root corresponding with our liquorice became  a very good ptisanne refreshed me and kept off the fever and in the course of two days by which time the storm entirely subsided I was able without risk to salley forth again and make my observations  My perquisitions were completely in vain I could discern no trace not even a single vestige of the ship the boats nor any human creature dead or alive and after traversing every accessable port and even venturing to the very verge of the promontary I was obliged to conclude that the tempest had borne the ship from the place where she struck and had either sunk her at a distance from the shore or dashed her to pieces against some other part of the island  In this temper I moved slowly back again to the cavern where though through the infirmity of human nature I shed a flood of tears I would not permit my tongue to  utter a single murmur An involuntary sigh however now and then escaped me and in the bitterness of my reflections I could not help wishing that if either of the boats had contained John Hewit that I had but seen him and perished in his arms  Exploring the different recesses of the cavern in search of mofs and that chalky substance I spoke of before I took a turn by accident round a sort of natural column and got into another large chamber like that I occupied As this was further remote from the entrance and consequently more sheltered from the weather I rejoiced at the discovery and concluded it might be expedient for me to change my habitation  This induced me to pay every attention to the situation of the place and for that purpose I struck out of it into a passage which seemed to lead on a descent to a  considerable distance I had my lamp with me all this while but observing a cranny through which beamed a glimmer of light in order to discover whence it came I laid the lamp down and walked up to the place without it  I soon discovered that it was only a reflection from another opening in a loftier situation and much larger and this last seemed to be dammed up with some substance that prevented it from conveying the light so clear and pure as it had been immediately received from the atmosphere In short I conjectured that other fragments of the rock built higher and higher made their way into the air and obstructed the free communication of light by means of this opening  I don't know what induced me to follow up my discovery for one thing it struck me that I might with greater facility than  I had been accustomed to get at the eggs of those fowls another season which had proved so nutritious  Something more than this curiosity certainly urged me on nay I trembled I knew not why at every step My sensations however were not induced by fear on the contrary I was full of a solicitous anxiety such as I had often felt but I think never so forcibly That mixture of pleasurable and painful suspence that has assailed me on the eve of every great event during my life produced a presentiment that convinced me such an event was at hand nor was I long before my expectations were verified  When I arrived at the opening in the rock I could plainly perceive that the object which obstructed the light was a part of some ship and presently afterwards I crept into her without difficulty through  one of her ports I next got up the forecastle and there perceived by her form that she could be no other than the vessel I had seen ashore but how she could have come into that situation jammed into a cleft of a rock I could not for the life of me imagine  Examining however around I concluded that as the tide set in the violence of the tempest had brought the ship along with it and by the influence of a tornado had thrown her into that situation where the storm having abated she was safe from danger as in a dry dock and putting circumstances together I found nothing extraordinary in this for in the year or thereabouts the hurricanes in the WestIndies did actually tear vessels from their moorings and thrown them into the towns One instance of which happened at Fort Royal in Jamaica and another at St Kitts  If I was ungrateful enough to murmur at my former disappointment how did I take shame to myself at the present moment To see succour comfort convenience nay even luxury brought as it were to my very door Oh how my grateful heart ran over I almost gloried in my strong trials convinced that I was still the care of Providence whose inscrutable decrees however weak sighted mortals may dare to dispute them permit not a fly to perish in vain  When my mind became a little more calm I determined to examine the ship By her size she must have been of seven or eight hundred tons burthen she was coppered bottomed and wore in every respect the appearance of an Indiaman and by her lading I soon found she was homeward bound In examining her more particularly I discovered that a large part of her cargo yet remained on board some of which had been materially damaged in  consequence of her having filled with water though she was perfectly dry at this time the water having ran out again through her leaks  And now a dreadful spectacle presented itself to my view Five dead bodies lay between decks in a most lacerated state a little further three more and at the door of a cabin which I found afterwards to be the purser's a man and woman of genteel appearance were locked in each other's arms I sustained all this misery with the best fortitude I could determined before I considered the living to pay every due respect I could to the dead  Among these poor wretches were three women and seven men I searched their pockets with a view to learn who they were but in this my expectation failed except in four instances The gentleman and lady I found in each other's arms were  Mons and Madame D'Oliviere a young man well dressed was called D'Aubignac and a woman apparently an attendant was named Jeannotte Du Bois  This intelligence I gathered from letters pocket books and other documents I found about them I also found other things such as knives scissars houswives and articles of use which to me turned out of singular convenience and now having by way of refreshment eaten some buscuit and drank a small quantity of excellent arrack to give me spirits I began my pious work  I unpacked a bale of chintz and sewed up each body in a double piece of it as tight as my poor strength would permit me and as much as possible in the shape of a mummy except the husband and wife who I wrapt up in each others arms as I found them which I considered as fulfilling  the will of the dead their last wish apparently being never to be seperated  This awful task took me up nearly three hours My next care was to see for a place where to deposit these relics of mortality and on looking from the side of the ship I saw a hole of about a yard diameter which seemed to be profound  Here I determined these unfortunate wretches should find a sepulchre and having by means of a rope which I formed with a block into a sort of tackle drawn each miserable carcass to the edge of one of the ports I let it down as gradually as I could followed it with my eyes till they were dimmed with tears and then repeating a short requiem bid it an earthly adieu  This pious ceremony I performed to each till the earth had hid them all from  my view I then fell upon my knees put up a fervent prayer for their everlasting felicity and followed it with a thanksgiving for my own miraculous preservation After this a ray of comfort beamed across my mind which I shall never forget and though I could not help pitying from my soul all those poor wretches who had vainly enterprized for so much treasure yet so impulsive is the vanity of human nature that my mind would for a moment admit no other consideration than that it was sent to me as a recompense for so much resignation in so many alarming trials  The radiant sun was now hastening to hide his lessening beams within the glowing ocean Being therefore heartily fatigued and having besides little opportunity to explore what fortune had sent me that evening I contented myself with examining the purser's cabin for refreshment  where I found a case of cordials some biscuits and other things and having sparingly refreshed myself with what I thought would best agree with me and determined to stay till morning I changed my strange weeds for some night cloaths of Madame D'Oliviere and went to sleep for the first time during eleven months in a bed  CHAP VIII GOOD FORTUNE PRESENTS HANNAH WITH ONE STORE AFTER ANOTHER OF ALL WHICH SHE IS DEPRIVED IN A SINGLE MOMENT BY A FATAL ACCIDENT  I WAKED with the day which arose with a garb as pearly and delicate as that was crimson and grand in which the former had set My first wish was to have a dish of tea which I knew I could easily get I therefore went to the galley kindled a fire by means of a pistol tinder box and while it was burning I returned through the rock to my brook and coming back set on my kettle It is  inconceivable how these familiar objects delighted my mind The contrast was so directly opposite to the inconveniences I had been accustomed to experience that no pleasure could be much more perfect than was mine at this moment  Having breakfasted I began to examine my wealth I plainly perceived that I had lost much of the private stock which the officers and passengers had lain in for their own convenience To make me amends however the purser's storeroom the sloproom and every other part where the substantial materials for food and clothing are always deposited were perfectly safe nor were any articles except those which salt water can spoil materially injured I found plenty of salt beef dried tongues hams potted sish portable soup and many other articles in high perfection and though the wet had perished a great  deal of the buscuit I got from first to last more than three hundred weight that was very good  Flour Indian wheat rice barley potatoes and a great choice of oriental seeds I found in abundance most of which except part of the flour was in a pretty good condition Several forts of wine particularly some cape wine and two pipes of Madeira were also as good as ever besides these in the different cabins I found cordials sweetmeats spices and almost every delicacy that the Eastern world affords and now having a stock of necessaries that with care would last me for many years and by cultivation procure me enough for many more I proceeded to see what merchandize I was in possession of  Among an astonishing number of other things bales of cottons muslins ginghams  shawls and ornamental paper presented themselves to my view Tea I found in plenty but the greatest part of that in the chests was damaged The private stock was however in general so well secured that it had taken no harm but what pleased me most was the carpenter's chest the master's and the doctor's In the first I found whatever tools I might stand in need of in the second were several case  of instruments for the purpose of navigation and in the third were medicines and physical books together with chirurgical instruments I had scarcely got possession of the master's chest but I took an observation and finding myself in the latitude of thirteen degrees eighteen minutes south I concluded I was upon one of the Comora Islands  In the chest also of different individuals I found colours chemical compositions besides china and utensils of various  kinds out of all calculation In short every thing that is usually to be found in a French homeward bound East Indiaman was now in my exclusive possession for the papers particularly several journals of the officers which were all written in French informed me that the name of this ship was the Entrepreneur and that she was bound from Rajapore to Bourdeaux  This survey which was attended with a good deal of fatigue lasted me six or eight hours after which I proceeded to convey into my cavern what I might most stand in need of and to be brief for it would be endless and irksome to the reader beyond idea to go over particulars in about ten days all which time as the weather was fair I slept aboard I had got together more articles both for utility and pleasure than I stood a chance of wanting as long as I should live  A true mortal my ideas enlarged with my possessions and that chamber which I had hailed with awful veneration which had afforded me an assylum like the cell of a saint I now considered as no place for one of my towering expectations It was dreary cold and inconvenient in moist weather and reflected such a humid gleam when the sun shone powerfully that I not only determined to have recourse to it for culinary and other household purposes alone but I resolved to build me a new habitation consisting of different apartments on the lawn before the cavern  To effect this I conveyed piece meal into the cavern a large number of spare yards capstern bars handspecks marlinspikes and other useful pieces of timbers together with an entire new suit of sails which were stowed away in the hold besides hoops staves a framed capstern blocks the machinery of a chain pump  and innumerable other articles My next determination was to uncopper the ship for which purpose I constructed a swinging scaffold and suspending it occasionally from the chains or other prominent parts of the hull I got in the course of three days a prodigious quantity of copper but as this seems a work not only beyond the strength but the ingenuity of any individual lest I should be suspected of exaggeration I shall minutely explain the nature of my operations  The principle of a tackle is extremely well known to seamen and to them it will not seem extraordinary that I should be able to hoist and lower ten times the weight that I could have managed by my proper strength through the means of such an engine especially as I had all sorts of ropes and blocks ready at hand for my purpose I have seen three seamen bowse a pipe of Madeira into the Grosvenor  from the waters edge which must at least have been twenty feet perpendicular and that pipe of Madeira must have weighed twelve hundred weight but this is but a trifling instance for any one who knows the doctrine of nautical mechanics will join with me in allowing that ten times more than this is practicable from a large complication of pullies so placed as to assist the purchase of one another  As to my swinging scaffold nothing could be more simple nor more secure than it was I got some of the nettings under the bowsprit and fixed it to a bottom of wood about two foot square This enclosed me as in a cage or to give a more familiar idea exactly like a cabbage net with a wooden bottom The top of this net or cage I fastened to a block with one pulley from whence went a rope to another block with two pullies and the block at bottom being fixed to that at  top in a working state I could hoist or lower myself at pleasure always taking care safely to belay my rope when I found myself in the desired situation to go on with my work Thus I loaded my cage with copper and when it contained a sufficient quantity I ran myself up unladed then lowered and went to work again  I could not refrain from going into this explanation because I should be extremely shocked if in this work probability were a single moment neglected Fertile in expedients as I naturally am and indeed as any one would be in the same situation yet many points in this history may seem extraordinary to those determined to doubt which through the allowance of a liberal latitude will only appear a lively ingenuity impelled by necessity  For three weeks with very little intermission  did I continue this work by which time I was completely furnished with every material I could possibly want My next task was to convey my building materials to the mouth of the cavern which with all my contrivance I began to fear would be utterly impracticable At last I determined to accomplish it by means of my framed capstern which I fancied I should find no difficulty in setting up at every turning and so gradually draw what I pleased to any given point upon the principal of warping a ship  As I had some fear lest a sudden hurricane might again remove the wreck from its present situation or shatter it to pieces I was now determined to content myself with what was in my possession and run no further risks Curiosity however or rather fate impelled me to pay the ship another visit to examine whether there was  any thing further that might be of use to me  Having penetrated into the bottom of the hold I looked at a variety of things but I had so many duplicates of them and grew so anxious to set about my grand plan that I was coming away resolved to search no further when all of a sudden I saw something glisten and going up to examine what it was guess my astonishment reader at finding the name of John Hewit studded upon a chest in small brass nails My very blood froze within me the place swam round with me and I fell with violence to the ground and so near the hole into which I had precipitated the dead bodies that it was a miracle I had not fallen into it  How long I lay deprived of life I know not but when I recovered my senses and with them the recollection that  my hopes and apprehensions concerning my husband when the ship was cast away were but too true I screamed aloud tore my hair and acted the part of a bedlamite In this extremity not considering how cautiously I ought to have stept from plank to plank my foot slipt and I fell through a hole in the bows into a hollow of the rock not less than a distance of eighteen feet and if I had not as it were by instinct caught hold of a rope in my fall I must have been inevitably dashed to pieces  Now was my state deplorable indeed I was shut out in one moment from all that comfort which I had so completely in my power By one fatal instance of imprudent curiosity I not only lost all that could make life endurable but come to the knowledge of that which made me regret the possession of life itself In  that situation I lifted up my streaming eyes to Heaven and most earnestly implored some pitying power to take my life to ease my affliction  CHAP IX HANNAH LOSES SIGHT OF ALL HOPE AND EXPECTATION AND AT LENGTH HER LIFE IS MENACED BY A DANGER FROM WHICH NOTHING LESS THAN A MIRACLE COULD HAVE PRESERVED HER  WHEN my grief had a little subsided I looked most piteously around me and as recollection succeeded to stupefaction I blamed my own ambitious pride for all that had befallen me Had I been contented with the necessaries of life without panting for luxuries I might have borne my situation sad as it was with resignation and fortitude and glided through existence though a forgotten yet an inoffensive  sufferer Now through my pride my folly and my indiscretion I was not only fated to perish in sight of plenty but my last moments were to be embittered with the torture of reflection  I next upbraided myself with having dared to repine after so many solemn vows to the contrary and though my eyes still were traitors to my promises I would not suffer my heart to acknowledge the treason I therefore bruised as I was looked about me to see if I could regain the ship but alas I too fatally saw it was impossible The rope which had so miraculously preserved me at its length would not have reached within ten feet of the ground but unluckily on my quitting it it had receded and twirled in a kink round a shattered piece of the cathead and as to any other means they were impracticable  The bows of the ship lay as in a cradle  over a prominence which was worse than perpendicular it was oblique the base bending inward and to get beyond it on either side was utterly impossible for had I fallen only a few paces any way from where I happened to alight The distance from the ship must have been thirty yards therefore my preservation was every way providential  When I reflected on this a faint glimmer of hope again revived in my mind I might by some other passage regain my cavern I might in my way make some useful discovery nay I might again visit the fatal chest and agreeably undeceive myself John Hewit was a very common name and it might belong to somebody else and not my husband Nay even if it were his he might have sold it after having no further use for it for after all what could be so unlikely as that he who was so excellent an English sailor should belong to a French ship  With these fond and weak but consolatory ideas with which hope seldom fails to flatter misery did I cheer myself till I had called into action a portion of my wonted fortitude It being yet early in the day I thought by perseverance I might get round the bottom of the rock and so make some discovery of importance before night should overtake me trusting to chance as to what wild fruit I might find in my way to eke out the small portion of buscuit which by good fortune I happened to have in my pocket and from what chrystal spring I might quench my thirst  With a heavy heart did I crawl and clamber from one craggy point to another taking that direction which I considered as most likely to lead me round to my habitation The further I ventured however the more I got astray no vestige of any known object presented itself to my view on the contrary my journey was  retarded by dangerous breaks overgrown with brambles in which it required the utmost judgment to avoid being enthralled  I had wandered about in this hopeless and forlorn condition for several hours sometimes directing my way towards the place of my destination and sometimes meeting with obstructions that obliged me to take a contrary direction when getting into a kind of irregular valley tremendously ridged with rocks on each side and sloping towards the sea I determined to see where it would lead in the hope that I should at the bottom of it regain the ridge of rocks on the shore which though it would be a work of infinite labour would in the end lead me to my cavern  This valley led me to an extensive lawn covered with the most beautiful verdure and planted as if with some human hand with clumps of orange citron and a prodigious  variety of other oriental fruit trees At the back which received the full south sun a ridge of rocks ran nearly in the form of an amphitheatre while vines of all sorts twining in great luxuriance interlaced their rugged face To the westward from a cleft in the rock burst in a large volume a beautiful cascade which being regorged from the sissures it perforated and bounded with redoubled force over the craggy prominencies that being thus washed looked like a rich mixture of porphory marble granate and spar it then made its way to the base with a most majestic and awful concussion and thence ran off in an ample and profound stream which emptied itself into a capacious bason about five hundred yards beneath it  To the east a ridge of cedars cocoa trees pines and other Eastern productions of the largest kind like a towering wood reached to the very surface of the mountain  Thus the valley I descended was nearly in the center of this beautiful lawn which being fringed round in the manner I have described to the right and left with ridges of rocks and trees the whole is an amphitheatrical form spread on in a gradual slope to the distance I suppose strait on of half a mile and in breadth a mile and a half the front bounded by a polished rock beneath which at high tide was washed by the sea but which was situated so high that the sea seldom or ever washed over it  Struck by the awful grandeur of this beautiful scene I paused and wondered I could scarcely think but that art had combined with nature in forming it These were my reflections Perhaps the island had been some time or other inhabited and that wild beasts with which I had received one shocking proof it abounded had devoured the inhabitants Who knew but that some other part of the Grosvenor's  people might have like me found a temporary shelter and alas like me a devoted grave  I was in this mood and had scarcely time to eat some of my biscuit and drink a little water when night overtook me I now crept into a close interwoven thicket and having secured myself from all dangers in the best manner I could I committed myself to the care of Providence  I had scarcely fallen asleep when I was roused by a most terrifying noise which I too well knew to be the roar of a lion Heavens what were my feelings at that moment Annihilation would have been mercy to me I was convulsed with horror my whole mass of blood curdled in my veins and frantic with despair as I knelt with my hands clasped in agony I knew not whether my distracted prayer to Heaven implored death or mercy  The noise encreased Twenty lions seemed to be in search of their prey At legth it died off and having listened with a death like silence for more than an hour my mind and body tired out nature again yielded to repose but Oh what a dream ensued  I dreamt John Hewit came to me all bloody He told me he had been torne by the jaws of a lion and begged me to hide him When I attempted it the lion came and tearing him from me scattered his limbs upon the plain I expected to be devoured in my turn instead of which the lion lay down before me fawned on me and kissed my feet In an instant I lost it and being transported to a barren wild I was set upon by thieves Binns rescued me from their violence and as I approached him he bade me stand off for that he had married his sister What succeeded was delirium and I waked just after day break in a violent fever  Parched with thirst I tottered I scarcely knew how towards the verge of the precipice that faced the sea where I had the day before found some ripe oranges When I arrived there I entered a recess from whence issued a most delicious odour occasioned by the orange and citron flowers that bloomed every where about me I gathered several branches of these and distracted as I yet was with the burning fever I formed them into wreaths and garlands singing incoherently bits and scraps of melancholy ditties  My intellects however were not so impaired but I soon became sensible enough of a danger that seemed to threaten me with inevitable destruction Getting to the very verge of the rock over which hung luxuriant branches of the orange trees loaded at the same time with fruit and blossoms I disturbed a monstrous lioness as she was stretched with a cub by her side My situation in one moment  was exactly the same as that of the horse in Stubbs's beautiful picture except that unlike him I knew my danger and therefore my blood instead of filling my veins receded to my heart and actuated by that knowledge and perhaps my distemper for nothing is so quick as madness I instantly meditated how to escape but before I could give my dreadful situation a single thought catching the glow of the monster's eye I was fairly under the power of facination A moment after I saw her in the act of springing at me when I measured my length upon the ground and died away  END OF THE SECOND VOLUME
