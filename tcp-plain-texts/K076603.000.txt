Printed for J SENEX at the  Globe  in  SalisburyCourt  and W TAYLOR at the  Ship  in  Paternoster Row    Mr  WHISTON  's LETTER  MY LORD  _SINCE your Lordship had so very considerable a Share in the late Debates in the House of Peers in  Opposition  to a Clause for the Toleration of the  Christian Religion itself  or of all that  believed the Holy Scriptures and the Common Creed  which I confess I had a great Hand in preparing and recommending could it have been admitted and in  Behalf  of a new  Athanasian Test  to be laid upon Christians whereby with the People called  Quakers  they were to profess  Faith in God the Father and in Jesus Christ his Eternal Son the True God and in the Holy Spirit One God Blessed for evermore  Since your Lordship had also the like Share in a late heavy Imputation laid on Dr  C  in the same House of Peers for omitting the Holy Spirit in Doxologies where yet that Imputation lay harder on my self nay indeed on St  Paul  and all the Apostles themselves than on Dr  C  He having only omitted the Holy Spirit in his Doxologics  sometimes  but I in Imitation of those Apostles never making him the direct  Object  of any Doxology at all And since your Lordship's  Chaplain Mr  Seaton  has lately publish'd an  Essay on the Eternity of the Son of God  address'd to the Laity of this City and written I must confess in a cool and sober Manner but as it were in Vindication of such your Lordship's Proceedings I think it cannot on all these Accounts be improper for me who so greatly dissent from your Lordship and your Chaplain in these Matters to address this Paper to your Lordship and therein to lay before you and the Christian World a fair Collection of the sacred and primitive Testimonies concerning this important Point I mean whether God the Father be the only Eternal Being the only Eternal God or whether the Son and Holy Spirit be also Eternal Beings or be  Coeternal  with the Father as all the real  Trinitarians  assert I say  real Trinitarians  only for as for the nominal or modal Trinitarians which also include the  Sabellians  and  Socinians  and are now the most numerous who say the Son and Spirit are not really different from but are or make up together with the Father the One Eternal God there is no room for the Question among them at all It being the absurdest Thing in the World to suppose that God is not coeternal to himself tho' the Expression be somewhat extraordinary Now in order to satisfy your Lordship and the World in this Matter I shall beg Leave at present to wave the common Method of disputing and arguing and pleading and drawing uncertain Consequences on either Side and shall set down instead thereof a Collection of those original Texts and Testimonies which relate to this important Doctrine that so every one may with his own natural common Sense and Judgment and without Fear of being impos'd upon by modern Inferences impartially pronounce on which Side the superior Evidence lies Your Lordship well knows that Truth is best discover'd by the open fair and solemn Way of Proceedings in Courts of Justice where the Evidence for Facts is still enquir'd into and examin'd from Eye and EarWitnesses or from the authentick Records themselves produc'd in Court  where the Judges determine of those Facts intirely by that original Evidence and where all that the Pleaders  allege  about those Facts goes for nothing any farther than it is thus  proved  Now what was the Doctrine of our Blessed Saviour and his Apostles or what was the Christian Faith in this Matter is certainly at this Day an ancient Fact and no otherwise to be now known but by ancient Evidence primitive Witnesses and original Records still remaining To these therefore do I solemnly Appeal in the present Question and by these and these only do I resolve to be determin'd therein And this Method is so evidently fair and reasonable that I cannot but hope that your Lordship and all equitable Enquirers will also approve of it and be willing to be determin'd by it Nor do I mean this with Regard to the present Doctrine or the real and strict  Coeternity  of the Son and Holy Spirit to the Father only but with Regard to all the like controverted Points in Christianity also which can I think be no other way so authentickly so satisfactorily and so peaceably determined among Christians as by this Procedure especially while in this Method the Meaning of doubtful Words and Phrases are to be stated no otherwise than by the ancient Use of the same and no modern Distinctions or Evasions unsupported by Antiquity will be admitted and where no later Translations will be of Weight any farther than they are supported by the primary Sense of the Original in the Ages wherein the Books themselves were written  I therefore upon this Occasion in the most publick and open Manner in the Behalf of my self and of others of my Opinion as to the Points now in Dispute among us do before your Lordship and before the Christian World invite all the sober and learned  Athanasians  to come into this Proposal I mean that omitting all the Passions the Tricks the Subtilties the Distinctions and Evasions of the Pleaders or  Disputers of this World  they will join with us in a calm a fair an authentick a friendly and a Christian Examination of these Points in the  Bible and primitive Antiquity and in drawing up after such an Examination an upright impartial and full Collection of all the ancient Texts and Testimonies before the Days of  Athanasius  which concern the same to be by joint Consent laid before the World with the bare summing up the Evidence on both Sides as the Judges themselves do in their Courts without any other Comments or Colours of our own whatsoever  Thus for Example the whole Christian Church My Lord did ever and does still unanimously own that there is but  One  Eternal Omnipotent Invisible and Almighty  God  the original Cause and Creator of all other Beings While many of the  Trinitarians  now affirm that the Father Son and Holy Spirit taken together are that  One God  and we on the other Side assert that God the Father and He alone is that  One God  Here My Lord we insist that the present  Trinitarians  may produce all those original Texts of Scripture all those ancient Creeds and all those primitive Testimonies which affirm the former and we will be oblig'd to produce in the same Manner all those original Texts of Scripture all those ancient Creeds and all those primitive Testimonies which affirm the latter And this is desir'd as to both Sides without the Admission of any novel Distinctions Evasions or Inferences whatsoever that so Christian People may have the Cause wholly before them and may be enabled to determine sairly and impartially on which Side the  superior Evidence  appears to be by which superior Evidence all certainly ought to be guided in such Matters And the like Procedure I would recommend in all parallel Cases whatsoever  And indeed My Lord this seems to me to be the only honest and Christian Method of disentangling these and the like Points from the Sophistry of captious Arguments Replies and Rejoinders with which the Writers of Controversy do on all Sides more or less perplex and puzzle but not properly satisfy their Readers And this Method  I confess My Lord I have had principally in my Eye from the very Beginning of my Concern in the present Controversy tho' the Pamphlets written against me have sometimes turn'd me from that my main Design and as it were forc'd me in some Degree to comply with the common Method I now therefore My Lord intend to reassume what I at first propos'd to my self and as I have lately which Your Lordship will see by the enclos'd laid the State of the Old Christian Doxologies before the World exactly as I found it in the New Testament and in the most early Antiquity without pretending from any Reasonings of my own to introduce one single Form different from what I there found upon Record So do I here design to lay before Your Lordship and the World with equal Fairness what I meet with in the first Ages concerning this important Point of the strict  Coeternity  of the Son and Holy Spirit to the Father I say the strict  Coeternity  only for as to the Preexistence of our Saviour before all  Time  and all  Ages  even those the Antients called  Eternal Times  with St  Paul    Tit I  or  before the World  with all its Creatures and Ages  began  as our Version well renders that Passage this is not the Question  Heb I  It being allowed on both Sides that this World with all its Creatures and Ages whatsoever were  made  under the Father by the Son who must therefore of Necessity be before the same without the least Consequence to be thence deduc'd that he was therefore  really eternal  or truly  coeternal  with his Father  NB  I do not quote the smaller Epistles of  Ignatius  nor some pretended Passages out of  Hippolytus Dionysius Alexandrinus c  they being liable to too many Objections as to their Genuineness to bear any Weight in this or any such Controversy whatsoever  I begin with those Texts of Scripture which Your Lordship's Chaplain Mr  Seaton  has cited for the  Eternity of the Son  and shall set them down both as they stand in our  English  Bible and as they more authentickly appear in the Septuagint Version  which alone was made Use of by Christ and his Apostles To which I shall add what other Passages occur in the Bible or earliest Antiquity that seem most to favour the same Eternity till the very Days of  Athanasius    Prov viii  The Lord possessed me created me LXXII the Beginning of his Ways before his Works of Old I was set up from everlasting  from the Age  or  Beginning of the World  LXXII

Language to bid the fairest for a real Eternity of the Son of any in all Christian Antiquity Yet is it very plain and evident from many other Passages that all of them were utterly against this proper Coeternity of the Son with the Father and even  Eusebius  only for the Metaphysick or potential Eternity before the Son's Generation as we shall see hereafter  The Texts and Testimonies for the

God sometimes the Lord and the Word sometimes he calls himself the General of the Host when he appear'd in the Form of a Man to  Joshua  the Son of  Nun  And he is call'd by all these Names because of his ministring to his Father's Will and because he was begotten voluntarily of the FatherBut the Production which really proceeded from the Father before all Creatures was with the Father and to him did the Father speak as the Word declares by  Solomon  For in the Beginning before all Creatures this very Offspring was produc'd by God which by  Solomon  is stiled Wisdom alluding to  Prov  viii  c

subsist was alone if we regard the Creation which was not yet made But if we regard this that all the Power of visible and invisible Beings subsisted in him all Things were with him for with him in metaphysick Existence the Word himself which was in him subsisted Now by his mere Will the Word came forth But the Word proceeding from him who did not thereby become empty became the firstborn Work

it pleased God to make whatsoever he had determin'd then he begat his Word by sending him forth the firstborn of the whole Creation  c  Athenagoras Legat ยง  If you have a Mind out of your Depth of Understanding to consider what this Son means I will briefly inform you He is the first Production of the Father Not as a Being  made  out of nothing For God who from the Beginning was an eternal Mind had in himself his Word or Reason being eternally rational But in such Manner as when all material Beings of unform'd Matter or Earth as their Substratum had lighter or heavier Parts mix'd together he proceeded out to them that they might exist both in Idea and Reality The prophetick Spirit also agrees to this account for says he the Lord created me the Beginning of his Ways for his Works  Irenaeus v  That his Production his firstbegotten Word may descend upon his Workmanship  Tertull Adv Prax ยง  They say indeed that  Genesis  in the  Hebrew  begins thus In the Beginning God made himself a Son But suppose that be not certain yet other Arguments there are which support my Opinion taken from the Oeconomy of God in which he was before the Constitution of the World until the Generation of his Son For before all Things God was alone  c  ยง  Hearken therefore to Wisdom as to a second Person created First we have this The Lord created me the Beginning of his Ways for his Works before he made the Earth before the Mountains were fastened nay he begat me before all the Hills  ยง  This is the compleat Nativity of the Word in his Procession from the Father at first created by him so far as thought under the Name of Wisdom The Lord created me the Beginning of his Ways  Adv Hermog ยง  Because God is both a Father and a Judge yet was he not therefore always a Father and a Judge because he was always God For he could not be a Father before he had a Son nor a Judge before there was any Sin Now there was a Time when there was no Sin and he had no Son The  former made him a Judge and the latter a Father  Adv Hermog ยง  What other Characteristick is there of God than Eternity What other Meaning is there of Eternity than to have always been heretofore and to continue always in Being hereafter by that great Privilege of no Beginning and no End If this be a Property of God it must be peculiar to God alone whose Property it is For altho' there be that are call'd Gods whether in Heaven or in Earth so far as the Name extends yet there is but One God the Father of whom are all Things  c  ยง  To conclude Assoon as he perceiv'd Wisdom was necessary for the making of the World he

Son was made by the Father and the Spirit by the Son  Haeres ยง  Epiphanius  says of  Origen  that he supposes the Son deriv'd from the Substance of the Father but to have been created by him And again That it was most plainly his Doctrine that the Son of God is a Creature and that from this bold Attempt about God it is to be supposed it was that he declared the Holy Spirit to be created also And again That when  Origen  says the Son is a  made God  he plainly determines that he is but a Created Being  Gregory of Neocaes Bas Ep  Basil  informs us that we shall indeed find in  Gregory  of  Naeocaesarea  many Expressions which did then afford the greatest Strength to the Hereticks such as the Word  Creature  and that of a  Being made  by God and the like  Novatian de Trin C  Before the Son there was nothing but the FatherGod the Father was therefore the Ordainer of all Things and their Creator He alone is without original invisible immense immortal eternal the One God to whose Greatness or Majesty or Power nothing can I don't say be preferr'd but so much as compar'd Of whom when it pleas'd the Father the Word which is his Son was begottenSince therefore he was begotten by the Father he is  always  in the Father I say  always  in such a Sense only which supposes him not unbegotten but begotten But I reckon he who was before all Time is said to have been  always  in the Father least the Father should not be  always  a Father For the Father is  prior  to him since it must needs be that as he is his Father he must be  prior  to him because it must needs be that he who has no Origin must be  before  him who has oneHe proceeded from the Father when the Father pleasedHe is certainly  before  all Things but  after  his Father making a second Person  after  his Father

Firstborn of the whole Creation  Dionysius Alexand Ep ad Max  Basil  owns that he had seen a great Number of the Books of  Dionysius  of  Alexandria  and addsWe don't admire every thing he says nay

Arians  affirm that the Blessed  Dionysius  said the Son of God was a  Creature  and a  Being made  Yes he did write so We ourselves also do own that there is such an Epistle of his  Theognostus Phot

Beginning of his Ways for his Works before the World he founded me in the Beginning before he made the Earth before the Mountains were fasten'd He begat me before all the Hills  Demonst Evang IV  The Light does not shine forth by the Will of the luminous Body but by a necessary Property of Nature But the Son by the Intention and Will  of the Father receiv'd his Subsistence so as to be the Image of the Father For by his Will did God become the Father of his Son and caused to subsist a second Light in all Things like unto himselfReceiving before all Ages a real Subsistence by the inexpressible and inconceivable Will and Power of the Father  See Dr  Clarke  's Scripture Doctrine of the Trinity Edit    p    Hist Eccl V  He is named the Firstborn of the whole Creation according to that Text The Lord created me the Beginning of his Ways for his Works  Ibid  The Divine Scripture sometimes calls the Son the Firstborn of the whole Creation as in his own Person in that Text The Lord created me the Beginning of his Ways  Contra Marcell II  The same  Eusebius  who by Direction from the Council of  Constantinople  wrote against  Athanasius  's great Friend the Heretick  Marcellus  charges his affirming the Son to be    unbegotten  as a grand Branch of his Heresy and to be    eternal  as another Branch of the same Heresy and directly implying the same with  unbegotten    Ibid  The same  Eusebius  says But perhaps thou art afraid that if thou allowest the Father and Son to be two Substances thou shouldst introduce two Principles and shouldst deny the Divine Monarchy Learn therefore that since there is but one God without any Origin and without Generation and that the Son is begotten of him there is but one Principle and one Monarchy and one Kingdom Since the Son himself reckons the Father to be his Origin For God is the Head of Christ as the Apostle says  Demonst Evang IV  The Father existed before the Son and had a Subsistence before his Generation as being alone unbegotten  Cap  God the Word was alone begotten of him by a Communication from him that begat him who was the unbegotten  first and the greater Being and he was declar'd God of God and called the Christ and the Anointed  C  Therefore O God He has anointed thee who is the supreme and greater Being and also thy God so that he who anointed is a  great deal Prior  to him that was anointed being the God of the Universe and especially of him who was anointed See  Maufaucon Praeliminar in Psalm p    V  The Son had not a Coexistence with the Father without Beginning the one being unbegotten the other begotten And the one being the Father the other the Son And every Body will confess that a Father does preexist and has an earlier Subsistence than a Son  Vid Maufaucon Praelimin Euseb in Psal p  The Son is the perfect Creature of him that is perfect the wise Building of him that is wise  He is a Being made  Ap Epiphan Haeres  Arius  in his private Letter to his great Patron  Eusebius  of  Nicomedia  before the Council of  Nice  affirms that this  Eusebius  of  Caesarea  and  Theodosius  and  Paulinus  and  Athanasius  and  Gregorius  and  Aetius  and all the Eastern Bishops say that God existed before his Son without any Beginning Excepting  Philogonius  and  Hellanicus  and  Macarius  who were no better than uncatechiz'd Hereticks  Athanas Orat II contr Arian  Let them learn to read after a due Manner also what is said in the Proverbs which it self has a right Meaning For 'tis written The Lord created me the Beginning of his Ways for his Works  NB  There is one Record ancienter than the Council of  Nice  so very remarkable in this Case that I cannot forbear to set it down intirely 'Tis a publick Letter from the Presbyters and Deacons of  Alexandria  sent on the Behalf of the  Arians  to their Patriarch  Alexander  who afterward condemn'd them in these Words  The Presbyters and Deacons to the Blessed Father our Bishop  Alexander  send greeting in the Lord  Apud Athanas De Synod Arim Seleuc Op Vol I p Epiphan Haeres LXIX ยง p  Our Faith which we have receiv'd from our Forefathers and which Blessed Father we have  learn'd from you also is this We own but One God who is alone Unbegotten who is alone Eternal who is alone without Beginning who is alone the true God who alone has Immortality who alone is Wise who alone is Good who alone is the Potentate who is the Judge the Orderer and Disposer of all Things Immutable and Unalterable Righteous and Good the God of the Law and the Prophets and of the new Covenant who begat his only begotten Son before the World began By whom he made the Ages and the Universe Begat him we mean not in Appearance only but Reality giving him his Subsistence by his own Will the Immutable and Unalterable and Perfect Creature of God but not as one of the ordinary Creatures A Being begotten by him but not as one of the ordinary Beings which were begotten Not that this Being begotten was an Emanation as was the Doctrine of  Valentinus  nor as  Manichaeus  suppos'd is the Being begotten a Consubstantial Part of the Father Nor as  Sabellius  who divided the Unity and call'd him both Son and Father Nor as  Hieraeas  Light from a Light or as one Lamp divided into two Nor as one that before was yet afterward was begotten or created into a Son As even you your self Blessed Father in the midst of the Church and in the Assembly of the Clergy have frequently rejected those who introduc'd these Opinions But as we say that he was Created by the Will of God before Time and before the World began and that he receiv'd his Life and his Being and all his Glory from the Father For the Father when he made him Heir of all Things did not deprive himself of any Thing which he has in himself without being begotten For He is the Fountain of all Things Wherefore there are three Substances and God himself who is the Cause of all Things is alone without Beginning But the Son being begotten by the Father before Time and created and founded before the World began was not before he was begotten but he alone as  begotten before Time by the Father did really subsist for he is not eternal or coeternal or unbegotten as the Father is nor has he his Existence together with the Father as some say who after a sort introduce two unbegotten Principles but God is so before all Things as the only Being and the Beginning of all Things  Wherefore he is before his Son as we have learn'd from you when you have preach'd in the midst of the Church  In as much therefore as he has his Being and all his Glory and his Life from God and all Things are deliver'd to him thence is God his Origin and Governor for he governs him as his God and as being  Prior  to him But if that Expression  From him  and that  From the Womb  and that  I came out from the Father and come  are understood as implying his being a consubstantial Part of him as an Emanation the Father is a compound Being capable of Division and Mutable and indeed according to them a Body And so as far as their Notions extend the Incorporeal God is liable to Corporeal Affections  Hist Eccl I  Sozomen  also relates that when this Dispute was started at  Alexandria  this  Alexander  knew not at first which Side to take and that it was a good while before he yielded to those that said our Saviour was    Consubstantial and Coeternal  with the Father  Theodor Hist Eccl I  The Council of  Nice  it self were so far from denying the  Creation  of the Son that the Words of St  Paul  who stiles him the  Firstborn of the whole Creation  were by  Eusebius  at first inserted into that Creed which he brought into the Council and which he informs us the Emperor and the whole Council agreed to be right tho' that Clause was afterwards omitted as not sufficiently favourable to the Designs against the  Arians  at that Time They were also so far from affirming the real Coeternity or proper eternal Generation of the Son that they only asserted the metaphysick Existence of the Word before his Generation as  Eusebius  shews in the only Original Account we have of that Matter in these Words And farther says  Eusebius  there The Anathema denounc'd against such as say  He was not before he was begotten  did not appear unreasonable since tis confess'd by all that he was the Son of God even before his Generation according to the Flesh Nay besides this our Emperor beloved of God confirm'd by Reason that even as to his Divine Generation he was before all Ages seeing that before he was actually begotten he was  potentially  in his Father when not yet begotten The Father being always a Father as he was always a King and a Saviour and every Thing  potentially  being always thus invariably and unalterably the same  These my Lord are the principal original Texts and Testimonies which concern the important Subject before us till the very Days of  Athanasius  himself  And now to sum up the Evidence on both Sides with what Clearness I can the Evidence for the Coeternity of the Son to the Father which has been above alledg'd I mean if as we ought to do we take the  Septuagint  Version whence Christ and his Apostles and the ancient Fathers always quoted the Old Testament to be of more Authority than our own or any modern ones in such Matters comes to no more than this  Viz  That our Saviour was  created  or  begotten  by his Father  in  or  before the Beginning of the World before  all the  Ages    Heb i  or that first Constitution of Things which was made or ordain'd by him under the Father That he was to be the  Father of the future Age  or  World to come    Heb ii  which we call the  last Age  or  Days of the Messiah  That his Origin was  of Old from the Beginning of the World  That he  was  in Being and was  with God  his Father in the very  Beginning  of Things nay had  Glory with his Father before the World was  That he was  before all Things  that he was the  first  and will be the  last  That he was  Alpha  and will be  Omega  And that some of these Expressions are the same or very like to  those by which the absolute Eternity of the Father is in other Places suppos'd to be express'd which last Observation however is only here taken for granted without Proof It no Way appearing that the sacred Writers meddle beyond our Faculties with any such absolute Eternity either  a parte ante  or  a parte post  as the Schoolmen have since done and yet without the Proof of that Point all this Evidence is very inconsiderable  It must also be remembred that the ancient Christians ever allow'd that the Expressions in the Old Testament concerning the invisible Father whenever there was a visible Person appear'd were spoken by the Son as the  Image of that invisible God  or as representing and personating the Father as his Minister and Vicegerent among Men and that they never look'd on them as true in the highest Sense of the Son himself but of the Father only Nor did they ever draw such Consequences from those Texts as do the Moderns  Melchisedek  is indeed said to have  neither Beginning of Days nor End of Life  when he is represented as a Type of Christ's earliest Origin and latest Duration but this certainly without the least Pretence to any proper Eternity of his at all So that the known Books of the Old and New Testament as understood before the Days of  Athanasius  seem to have no proper Evidence at all for the real Eternity of the Son of God As for  Polycarp  's and  Justin  's Expressions of Christ that he is the  the  eternal  Priest or High Priest no wise Man will thence gather any Thing about the real Eternity of the Son before he was an  High Priest  The Author of the Recognitions also speaks of the Eternity of the Son and calls him the  eternal Christ  But then it is well known that he did not thereby mean his real Coeternity  a parte ante  with his Father Nay it has appear'd already that of all the Ancients he is the most express for his being a Creature and he therefore hereby rather gives us a Rule how we ought to explain such Words in other ancient Authors  while they seldom or never mean by such Expressions more than from the Beginning of the World or to the End of it  Irenaeus  does indeed say not only that Christ was God's  eternal Word  but that he was  unmade  or as I suppose he means  not made out of nothing  as he supposed Men to be that he did  always coexist with God  and was  ever with him  and avoided saying that God  created him  which the rest used freely to say in those Ages All this makes it very probable that this Father did believe the Eternity of the Son in some Sort or other But then it must not be dissembled that even  Irenaeus  as we have seen owns him a derived Being produc'd by his Father before all other Beings Which seems hardly reconcilable to an absolute Coeternity And that this Sort of Eternity of the  Word  which we meet with in some such Philosophers of the second third and fourth Century is quite another Thing from the real  Coeternity of the Son  under our present Consideration As is most obvious in the ancient Accounts of that Matter Their Notion was plainly this that all other Beings were made out of nothing but that the Son was in a subtile manner  in  his Father virtually potentially or as his internal Word and Wisdom from all Eternity and that a little before the Creation and not sooner this Word was in an ineffable manner begotten or created out of his Substance into a real subsisting Being or Person So that the Testimonies for this Sort of Eternity which alone we find even till a good while after the Council of  Nice  it self are a Demonstration that the  real Coeternity  of the Son with the Father or his proper  eternal Generation  was then utterly unknown among Christians Nor does even this metaphysick this virtual or potential or internal Eternity of the Son ever appear in the sacred Writings in the ancient Creeds or Liturgies or in any of the Apostolical Fathers Whereby 'tis plain that it is no Part of the Sacred the Apostolical or the Christian Doctrine and no more than a Conjecture  or Hypothesis of some ancient Christian Philosopers Whether  Clement  of  Alexandria  ever believ'd even in his younger Years before he was throughly instructed in Christianity that Christ was really  eternal  it is not certain Because the Epithet  eternal  in the former Passage cited from him does not always denote a real Eternity and may belong to the Father and not to the Son and if  Clement  did once call him the  eternal Light  in a Poem the Latitude of such Writings especially of that romantick Piece ascrib'd to him into which this Phrase is inserted still more plainly forbids us to draw any such settled Conclusion from it Especially when he elsewhere most plainly said he was the  first created Wisdom of God  and in another Work directly  depress'd him into the Rank of a Creature  as we have already seen So that unless we believe such Authors had a Fancy that a common  Creature  or the World it self might be  coeternal to its Creator  we must not quote them for the Son's proper Coeternity to his Father And as to the seemingly most express Testimonies of  Eusebius  who calls the Generation of the Son  eternal  and says the Son was  always  and  beginningless  and at  all Times  with the Father that he was elder than all  Time  and all  Ages before  and  still before all Ages  that he subsisted  from endless Ages  or rather  before all Ages  that he was  before all  was the  ancientest Being of all Time and of all Ages  that he reign'd with his Father  from beginningless Ages  and that of the P  esbyters and Deacons of  Alexandria  that God begat him  before eternal Times  they here according to the ancient Stile denote no more than that he was  before the World began  as we are fully assured by many other clearer and plainer Passages of the same Authors wherein they directly and absolutely deny the Son's Coeternity with the Father notwithstanding as we shall see hereafter  And as to some other of the Testimonies omitted in this Sum of the Evidence they are so little  to the Purpose that the insisting on them shews how scarce the Proofs are on that Side  Vid Jud v  To conclude this Head As the  Greek  Language has three Ways of Speaking which are sometimes rendred  eternal  the first  or  or  or  The second  And the third  The first of which does seldom or never signify a proper Eternity the second not always and the third and that alone always does so 'tis very remarkable that the Bible and Apostolical Fathers never in this Case of the Antiquity of the Son use any but the first none of those before the Council of  Nice  more than the first and very rarely the second while  Athanasius  and his Followers and none before them directly ventur'd on the third Way of Speaking and called the Son  Coeternal  Which how it cou'd happen if the proper  Co eternity  of the Son to the Father were then all along the known Doctrine of Christianity I do by no Means understand Briefly in the fourth Century we find this Coeternity plainly asserted we find obscure Intimations about a subtile Sort of Eternity in the third and latter Part of the second but in the former Part of the second and the first Century we lose all certain Footsteps of any Eternity whatsoever Which Observation renders this Evidence for the  Coeternity  even tho' we had no opposite Evidence to weigh on the other Side exceeding weak and precarious  But then as to the original Evidence against this  Coeternity  of the Son and for his  voluntary Generation  or  Creation  by the Power of the Father before the World began the Sum of it is as follows  That the Son was not an underiv'd unoriginated independent and in that Sense an Eternal Being but truly derived from and produced or begotten by the Father is the unanimous Voice of all Christian Antiquity both in and after the Apostolical Age and is not directly deny'd by any  Athanasian  at this Day Now how a confessedly deriv'd produc'd and begotten Being an Onlybegotten  Son should be really coeternal with his underiv'd unbegotten and necessarilyexisting Author Producer and Father I cannot possibly understand  That the Son was also  voluntarily begotten  by the Power of the Father we have the plain and numerous Testimonies of the Apostles themselves in their Constitutions of  Ignatius  of the Author of the Recognitions of  Clement  of  Justin Martyr  of  Tatian  of  Tertullian  of  Novatian  of  Lactantius  of  Eusebius  and of the Presbyters and Deacons of  Alexandria  without the least Syllable that any one Christian thought of his being deriv'd from the Father as the Moderns pretend by  Necessity of Nature    That he was also  created  by God the Father is also most evident in all Sacred and Christian Antiquity This Doctrine begins from  Solomon  in the Old Testament as explain'd by the Christian Revelation and is continued by the Son of  Sirach  and  Philo  the Jew to the Writers of the New Testament  Peter Paul John Hermas  the Apostles in general in their Constitutions all these in the first Century Thence it passes down to  Ignatius  to the Author of the Recognitions of  Clement  to  Justin Martyr Melito Tatian  and  Athenagoras  in the secon'd Century And from all these it comes down to  Clement  of  Alexandria Tertullian Origen Gregory  of  Neocoesarea Novatian Cyprian Dionysius  of  Alexandria Theognostus  and  Methodius  in the d Century to  Lactantius  and  Eusebius  and to the  Alexandrian  Presbyters and Deacons nay even to  Athanasius  himself in the fourth Century and this so far as we know without any one Person's excepting against the Word  Created  as improper 'till  Athanasius  without any one's asserting that the Son was  uncreated  till he did it and with the direct Assertion of several that he was a  Creature  a Being  made  by the Father tho' vastly superior to all other Creatures or Beings made by him  That the  voluntary Generation  or  Creation  of the Son for I take them to mean the same Thing was a little before the Creation of the World also is the only natural Import of almost all and the direct Assertion of some of the Testimonies without the Contradiction of any one Christian Writer  also that I know of till the fourth Century or the Days of  Athanasius    That the Body of the Church even in the Beginning of the fourth Century nay even at and some Years after the Council of  Nice  it self knew nothing of any real Eternity of the Son nor deny'd that he was a Being begotten or created by the Will and Power of God a little before the Beginning of the World is very plain from the Testimonies here produc'd So that 'tis hard to say what original Evidence the real Trinitarians have gone upon when they have so long made the World believe that the Son is truly  Coeternal  with the Father and this as a prime Article establish'd at the Council of  Nice  nay as a fundamental Doctrine of Christianity it self since whatever Authority there may be for the  potential  or  metaphysick  there seems to be directly none at all for this  real Coeternity  or proper  eternal Generation  'till a good while after the Council of  Nice  Nor would the great and learned  Eusebius  when he wrote by the Direction of the Council of  Constantinople  and several Years after that of  Nice  have ventur'd openly to charge  Marcellus  with Heresy for saying that Christ was  eternal  if that his Eternity had been the known Determination of the Council of  Nice  or indeed the known Doctrine of the Church either in that or in the foregoing Ages of the Gospel  That this Coeternity of the Son is a very strange Doctrine to such as have the Unity of God for the Foundation of their Religion such as all the Patriarchs the Jews and the Christians ever had will be granted by all That therefore there was a great Occasion for a clear and express Declaration of this Eternity of the Son if it were true is very evident while yet neither the Scriptures nor the Apostolical Constitutions nor any ancient Creeds whatsoever have any one such clear Declaration nay have many such clear Declarations concerning One only true or eternal God  Rom I Tim  One only  eternal Power and Godhead  One only  King of Ages or eternal immortal invisible the only wise God  as supposes  the contrary especially while they add to those Declarations that this One God is no other than the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ  Thus all the old Creeds or Confessions of Faith do begin with this as the first Doctrine of Christianity  I believe in One God the Father  or as the Baptismal Creed itself expresses it  Constitut  I believe in One unbegotten Being the only true God Almighty the Father of Christ  while what they say of the Son has not the least Intimation of either his Coequality or Coeternity but the contrary which is particularly the Case of the original Creed beforemention'd where the Article concerning the Son begins thus  I believe in the Lord Jesus Christ the only begotten Son of God the Firstborn of the whole Creation who before the Ages was begotten by the good Pleasure of the Father  which seems to me an authentick a sacred and an undeniable Testimony against any real Coeternity of the Son to the Father  Nor indeed My Lord are the Expressions all along used in the foregoing Collection of Texts and Testimonies capable of any fair Sense consistent with this Coeternity since many of them directly confute the same Thus the Apostolical Constitutions affirm That God the Father is  eternally One only  or  The Only Eternal Being  That those are Hereticks who say as do the  Trinitarians  in Effect that God is  three  or  manifold  or that there are  three Gods coeternal with one another  The Apostles  Paul  and  John  by calling Christ the  Firstborn of the whole Creation  and the  Beginning of the Creation of God  do in the most plain usual and obvious Sense of the Words and as they were understood in the first Ages especially if we consider the Allusion these Passages bear to the Text in the  Proverbs  as then understood by all  The Lord created me the Beginning of his Ways  directly affirm that Christ was  the first Being God created  The Author to the  Hebrews  directly affirms that God  made  Christ which in the fourth Century was reckon'd so heterodox that this Epistle was in some Places seldom read in publick and that partly out of the Dread of such an Expression as  Philastrius  assures us  De Haeret C  St  Peter  is also introduc'd in that very ancient Book called The  Preaching  of  Peter  as declaring that God  made  his firstborn Son St  Hermas  directly asserts that the Holy Spirit which was placed in a Body or the Word of God incarnate was  created  the first of all Beings The Apostolical Constitutions enjoin us to dedicate our selves to the  eternal God  not through his  coeternal Word  as the  Athanasians  would certainly have said but through  that Word which was in the Beginning  as the greatest Antiquity of the Son then known in the Church  Ignatius  and the Author of the Recognitions of  Clement  assure us that the very  Substance  of our Saviour was not the  unbegotten Substance  of the Father but was it self begotten by the Divine Power The Author of the Recognitions affirms that Christ was himself a  made Being  and that the Will of God  preceded  his Generation  Justin Martyr  who always indeed avoided those Expressions himself of a  Creature  and a  made Being  did not yet in the least find Fault with  Trypho  the Jew when he declar'd that he understood that both he and the Scriptures quoted by him meant that the God of the  Jews made  our Lord and God Christ Jesus Nor does this  Justin  among his numerous Expressions concerning the Son's praeexisting State of which he is so very full ever venture to say any thing that looks like his real Coeternity with the Father  Tertullian  who yet favour'd the Son's metapyhysick Eternity as much as any directly affirms there was a Time  when God was not a Father and had not a Son Clement of Alexandria  whatever he had said in his younger Years did at last own that Christ was the  first created Wisdom of God  and was to be reckon'd as a  Creature Origen  did also plainly and clearly own that he was one of the Creatures of God tho' the ancientest of 'em all even so ancient that he cared not to assign the Date of his first Generation or Creation and the Reason seems to have been that he had a Fancy that the World it self though created by God might possibly be coeternal with its Creator  Gregory  of  Naeocaesarea  did also directly  profess that Christ was a  Creature  or a  Being made  by God  Novatian  also or the acute but unknown Author of the Book concerning the  Trinity  affirms that God the Father is the  only eternal God  to whom no other Being can be so much as compar'd that the Son was then begotten when  it pleased the Father  who and who alone was  prior  to him and that as a necessary Consequence from his being his Father  Dionysius  of  Alexandria  directly affirms Christ to have been a  Creature  and supposes not only a Difference of the Subsistences of the Father and Son but a Diversity of  Substance  an Inferiority of  Power  and a Difference of  Glory  so that he as well as many others seems not to have had so much as a Notion of a metaphysick Eternity  Theognostus  also declar'd that the Son was a  Creature Lactantius  is express for the Generation or Creation of the Son a little before the World was made  The great  Eusebius  whom the  Athanasians  used sometimes to hale over to their Party as if he believ'd the  Coeternity  of the Son is so fully understood since the later Publication of some of his Works long lost that he is now generally allowed as he was in his own Age to be clearly against it Nor is there Room for any Dispute since he directly says the Father was  prior  nay  a great deal prior  to the Son and charg'd  Marcellus  as introducing an Heretical Notion when he asserted that the Son was    Eternal  which Assertion he directly took to be the same as  Unbegotten  of all which Opinions of  Eusebius  the very learned  Monfaucon  has given so full an Account in his Preliminaries to  Eusebius  's Psalms that I reckon none of the truly Learned will any more pretend he was an  Athanasian  Nor will any one doubt of the Opinion of many of the Bishops in the  East  and in  Egypt  hardly indeed of  Alexander  of  Alexandria  and of the Council of  Nice  's own Opinion against the proper Coeternity  Collection of ancient Monuments by me  who carefully peruses the original Records here and elsewhere publish'd relating to that Age which yet was generally dispos'd to advance  the Dignity and Antiquity of the Son as much as possible I now proceed to the other Point the Coeternity of the Holy Spirit  The Texts and Testimonies which prove that the Holy Spirit was created or made under the Father by the Son before the World began and against his Coeternity  Paul  CHRIST through  the eternal or Holy Spirit so twelve or thirteen of the Copies read of the Text offer'd himself without Spot to God  Peter Pet  The Spirit of Christ  Apostles Constitut vi  One God the Father of One Son not of many the Maker of One Comforter by Christ  vii  I am

that moved them  Ibid ยง  Plato  read that it was said by  Moses  that the Spirit of God moved on the Face of the Waters He assigns the third Place to the Spirit that is said to have moved on the Water when he says But the third Sort of Offices belong to the third Person  Athenagoras Legat ยง  All Things are held together by that Spirit which is derived from him  Theophilus  of  Antioch Ad Antotyc i p  He begat him together with his Wisdom and sent him out before the Beginning of the WorldThis Person then being the Spirit of God and the Origin of Things and Wisdom and the Power of the Most High descended upon the Prophets and by them spake what concern'd the making of the World and all other Things For the Prophets were not in Being when the World  was made but that Wisdom which was in him which was the Wisdom of God and his Holy Word which is always present with him  c  Irenaeus i  By his Word and Spirit he makes and orders and governs all Things  iv  There do minister to

of God is the only begotten Being derived from no other Origin but begotten or born of Him after an ineffable Manner In like Manner do we speak of the Comforter  iii  Whereas then there is one Unbegotten Being and one Begotten the Holy Spirit cannot be called a Son nor the Firstbegotten For he was  made  by a Being that was  himself made  But he is recounted in Subordination to the Father and the Son as the first perfect Effect of the Power of the second Being  Tertull Adv Prax  I suppose the Spirit is deriv'd from no other Origin than from the Father by the Son  Origen Comment  in  Joan p  We must enquire whether it follows from this Place which affirms that  all Things were made by the Word  that the Holy Spirit was made by him also For I suppose he that says The Holy Spirit is a Being made and admits of this Assertion that  all Things were made by the Word  must of Necessity grant that the Holy Spirit was made by him and that by Consequence  NB  the Word was more ancient than he But he that will not admit that the Holy Spirit was made by Christ must by Consequence say he is Unbegotten if he withal judges what is said in the Gospel to be trueWe who are perswaded that the Father Son and Holy Spirit are three Substances and do believe there is nothing Unbegotten but the Father do admit this Notion as most agreeable to Piety and Truth that when all Things are said to be made by the Word the Holy Spirit is the most honourable and first in Order of those Beings which the Father made by Christ  c  Eusebius De Eccles Theolog iii  Now the Son alone is honour'd with the Paternal Divinity and has the Power of making and creating all Things that are made visible and invisible and even is the Producer of the Existence of the Spirit the Comforter himself For all Things were made by him and without him not one Thing was made And by him were all Things created both those in Heaven and those on Earth whether they be visible or invisibleNow the Son is the only begotten God who is in the Bosom of the Father But the Spirit the Comforter is neither God nor the Son of God because he did not receive his Generation from the Father in the same Manner as did the Son but is one of those Beings which were made by the Son For all Things were made by him and without him not one Thing was made These are then the Mysteries of the Catholick and Holy Church deliver'd by the Divine Oracles while  Marcelius  confounding all Thingsintroduces one Substance with three Persons and  three Names therein saying that God and the Word which is in him and the Holy Spirit are all one  These my Lord are the chief among the Primitive Texts and Testimonies concerning the Origin of the Holy Spirit which are so much on one Side even till long after the Council of  Nice  that I have not found it necessary to divide them under two Heads as I did those of the Son Since the only valuable Testimony that may seem to favour the real Eternity of the Holy Spirit which is that in the Epistle to the  Hebrews  of the  eternal Spirit  uses only the Word  which seldom or never signifies a proper Eternity since so many of the Copies have not there even that Epithet but the usual one of  Holy  instead of  Eternal  Spirit and since 'tis not certain that this Place belongs to the third Person at all but perhaps to the Divine Nature or Word it self in Christ  Bull Defens Fid Nicaen Sect i ยง  which  Grotius  and Bishop  Bull  have shewed several Times to have the Character of an  Holy Spirit  So that I have no Occasion here to sum up the Evidence on both Sides at all as to the Coeternity of the Holy Spirit to the Father or even as to his equal Antiquity with the Son for either of which there is not that I know of one proper or direct Testimony sacred or primitive now extant in the Records of the Christian Church till long after the Council of  Nice  in the latter Days of  Athanasius  himself  And now My Lord I beg that your Lordship will please soberly to review the Evidence that is here produc'd before you and the World and will suppose your self in the High Court of Chancery in the same Capacity as your Noble Father formerly presided there and will put the Case that your Lordship had an exactly parallel Cause before you that the Witnesses were as numerous and as plain on each Side as these here produc'd appear to be and no otherwise and that your Lordship were oblig'd to proceed exactly  secundum allegata probata  which is the known Rule of that and all other like Courts of Justice and Equity among us And I thereupon Appeal to Your Lordship supposing you had no Byass on either Side as no upright Judge ought to have whether you could possibly with a safe Conscience determine on the Side representing the  Athanasians  Whether in a Point where the general Light of Nature and common Sense is so strong against the  Athanasian  Doctrine the Testimonies for it comparatively so few and so uncertain and those against it so very many and so very pregnant whether I say your Lordship could possibly with a safe Conscience pronounce from this Evidence that the Son of God and his Holy Spirit are strictly Coeternal to the Supreme God the Father as the  Athanasians  affirm Or whether you would not be forced to declare in Agreement with the Voice of Natural the Patriarchal the Jewish and the original Christian Religion that there is but one  eternal Being  one  eternal God  and that he is no other than the  Father of our Lord Jesus Christ    And here My Lord give me Leave to wish heartily to wish that these ancient Texts and Testimonies thus plainly produc'd before you in this one important Article might so far influence Your Lordship as to engage you to endeavour that the same Method might be taken in the other Branches of this and all other the like Controversies among Christians That Your Lordship who has had long so considerable a Hand in the publick Management of Affairs Sacred and Ecclesiastical as well as Temporal and Civil in this Nation might be a happy Means of bringing all the Parts of our old genuine Christianity to such a fair open and impartial Examination as I have here propos'd and endeavour'd to exemplify in these Papers that so Party Faction and Prejudice laid aside all honest and sober Christians might in a peaceable Manner unite together into such  Societies for promoting Primitive Christianity    as has been formerly exemplify'd at my House or however might jointly prosecute the same pious Designs for the Discovery and Restoration of the Pure and Holy Religion of our Saviour Christ as it was  once deliver'd to the Saints  by such other Christian Methods as they should judge might better tend to the same excellent End  It has hitherto been Your Lordship's great Glory to have supported and encourag'd that Church of  England  in which you was educated and the World has great Reason to believe by your daily religious Attendance on the Church's Liturgy at Home as well as by your alike devout weekly Attendance on the same publick Service at Church either of which in our Age I am sorry to say it is but too uncommon in Persons of your Lordship's Quality that you are in earnest in such your Support and Encouragement thereof or that you do it because you believe this Church to be truly agreeable to the Primitive State of the Gospel Would it not therefore My Lord be still more highly honourable for your Lordship to be a Means of making a more careful Review of our Doctrine Worship Practice and Discipline That so the same Church which has long been the Glory and Bulwark of the Protestant Religion even in it's present imperfect State may first of all the rest be exactly conform'd to the Perfection of the Christian Settlement and so may be the great Exemplar and Pattern of all the other Churches as they become gradually sensible of the Necessity of such a farther Reformation All the modern Churches and among them our own are to be sure very unwilling to allow that they stand in any great Need of a farther Reformation But as your Lordship will easily observe that the learned Members of every one of these Modern Churches declare such a farther Reformation to be necessary in all other Churches but their own so am I very sure that the truly Learned and Impartial of every one of them who have carefully compar'd  the present Settlements with that of the first three Centuries of Christianity do  privately know  how little soever they may  publickly confess  that every one of the present Churches without Exception do stand in no small Need of such a farther Reformation I beg Leave my Lord to conclude here very nearly in the Words with which I formerly ended my fourth Volume of  Primitive Christianity Reviv'd    I do here solemnly appeal as to the Truth and Fairness of my Quotations and Assertions here and elsewhere to Archbishop  Wake  Bishop  Hooper  Bishop  Smalridge  Bishop  Potter  Bishop  Chandler  L C J  King  Sir  Isaac Newton  Dr  Bentley  Dr  Whitby  Dr  Clarke  Dr  Hare  Dr  Marshal  Dr  Waterland  Mr  Wall  Mr  Gale  Mr  Reeves  and the other great Masters of Primitive Antiquity and claim it as the Right of Truth and Religion that they speak their Minds fairly and fully  as they will answer it to our common Lord another Day  when no political prudential or temporal Regards will be admitted against the  plain Demands of Conscience and Sincerity  And I humbly move those in Authority that they procure this whole Matter to be impartially and  publickly  examin'd as the other Popish Doctrines were at the Beginning of the Reformation and if the common Opinions appear not only destitute of but contrary to the Evidence of Scripture and the first Centuries  as I am fully perswaded they will  that then Care be taken to cast them out of the Church and to amend and reform all our publick Offices Creeds and Articles and reduce them all to the Primitive Standards I also humbly move that in Order to these and the like Amendments and Improvements in our Ecclesiastical Establishment the Pretensions of that wonderful Book still extant the  Apostolical Constitutions  be examin'd with the like Care and in the same publick Manner And so far as it shall appear to be a genuine uncorrupted Apostolical Work by  Clemens Romanus  with the Addition of the most authentick original Jewish and Gentile  publick Liturgies  as I am fully perswaded it will  it may then be allow'd its due Weight in the Amendment of the Doctrine Discipline Government Worship and Canons of the Church or rather that it may intirely be admitted as an original Rule and Standard in those Matters as all Christians who believe them genuine and for the Main uncorrupt are immediately oblig'd to do especially since the leaving these Constitutions and setting up other Doctrines and Orders in their stead seem to have been the very Causes of almost all the Antichristian Corruptions of these last or Years together But if all these my honest and wellmeant Endeavours and Desires be rejected and instead of any Reformation I my self be traduc'd and abus'd and persecuted I can only acquiesce in the Sense of having sincerely with some Trouble and Hazard to my self in this World discharg'd my Duty and patiently wait for my Reward in that which is to come For as to those Anathema's or Names of Distinction and Reproach which in this Case I must expect I value them not at all As having long accustom'd my self to govern both my  Belief  and my  Life  by the  original Standards of Christianity  without Regard to the contrary Opinions and Practices of these  later and corrupter  Ages And so  LIBERAVI ANIMAM MEAM    I am My Lord with great Respect  Your Lordship's most humble and obedient Servant Will Whiston  July  BOOKS
